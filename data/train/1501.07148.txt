    "two decades after the first confirmed discovery of planets outside the solar system @xcite , we know more than 1500 confirmed planets of different mass , size and surface temperature that are orbiting around stars of different spectral types .",
    "many of the gas giant planets discovered are orbiting so close to their parent stars that tidal effects of the star and atmospheric erosion due to strong stellar irradiation play dominant role in determining their physical properties and evolution @xcite . on the other hand , many small and possibly rocky planets are recently discovered that may have surface temperature similar to that of the earth .",
    "therefore , the focus has rapidly changed into detecting planets that may have favorable environment to harbor life .",
    "classically , a habitable zone is defined as the one that has favorable ambient temperature to keep water in liquid state @xcite . in the recent years a good number of planets are detected within the habitable zone around stars of various spectral types @xcite .",
    "it is known that about 75% of the stars in the extended solar neighborhood are m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "analysis of data obtained by using the transit method indicates the occurence rate of small and potentially rocky planets with radius ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 @xmath0 ( @xmath0 is the radius of the earth ) around m dwarf stars is about 0.51 per star @xcite while that by using the radial velocity method is 0.41 per star @xcite .",
    "it is believed that a good fraction of these rocky planets are situated within the habitable zone of their star .",
    "therefore , there may exist a large number of habitable planets in the solar neighborhood and in our galaxy .",
    "however , a habitable planet should have appropriate amount of hydrogen , nitrogen , oxygen gas and water molecules that support a habitable environment .",
    "various thermal and non - thermal mechanisms cause hydrogen to escape the atmosphere of a terrestrial planet .",
    "thermal mechanisms include hydrodynamic escape and jeans escape .",
    "the loss of hydrogen from a planetary atmosphere is limited either at the homopause by diffusion or at the exobase by energy .",
    "diffusion causes substantial hydrogen loss during the early evolutionary period of a terrestrial planet . in today s earth , the atmosphere is collisionless above the tropopause and hence the barometric laws break down .",
    "therefore , jeans law is not applicable .",
    "jean s law is also not applicable if the atmosphere is not under hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this may occur by the absorption of stellar extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) radiation with wavelengths ranging from 100 to 920 @xmath1 .",
    "strong euv irradiation heats up the hydrogen rich thermosphere so significantly that the internal energy of the gas becomes greater than the gravitational potential energy .",
    "this leads to the expansion of the atmosphere and powers hydrodynamic escape of hydrogen which can drag off heavier elements if the escape flux is high enough .",
    "the earth does not receive sufficiently strong euv irradiation from the sun at present .",
    "also the total hydrogen mixing ratio in the present stratosphere is as small as @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , in today s earth , hydrogen escape is limited by diffusion through the homopause .",
    "the bolometric luminosity is one of the important observable stellar properties that determines the distance of the habitable zone ( hz ) or the circumstellar region in which a planet can have appropriate temperature to sustain water in liquid state . on the other hand",
    ", the euv luminosity determines the rate at which hydrogen escapes from the atmosphere of a planet in the hz .",
    "if the bolometric luminosity of the star is low , the hz is closer to the star and hence a planet in the hz is exposed to stronger euv irradiation . if the euv luminosity of such faint stars is sufficiently high then a habitable planet would lose substantial amount of hydrogen and heavier gases .",
    "it would lead to oxidation of the surface and accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere , scarcity of hydrocarbon and significant reduction in surface water .",
    "all these would make the planet uninhabitable .",
    "if a habitable planet undergoes runway greenhouse , water vapor would reach the stratosphere where it would get photolyzed and subsequently should escape the atmosphere .",
    "in this paper , i present an analytical expression for the upper limit of the ratio between the euv and the bolometric luminosities of a planet - hosting star of any spectral type which serves as an essential condition to ensure the presence of sufficient amount of hydrogen , nitrogen , oxygen , water etc . that supports the habitability of a rocky planet in the hz of the star .",
    "since both @xmath3 and @xmath4 are observable quantities , it will help to determine if a planet in the habitable zone of a star is really habitable or not .",
    "thus the limit should serve as a ready reckoner for eliminating candidate habitable planets .",
    "the distance of a habitable planet from its parent star is given by @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the bolometric luminosity of the star and the sun respectively , @xmath8 is the distance between the earth and the sun ( 1 au ) and @xmath9 is the normalized effective stellar flux incident on the planet .    let @xmath3 be the euv luminosity at the surface of a star . if @xmath10 is the efficiency at which the euv is absorbed by the planetary atmosphere then the sphere - averaged and efficiency corrected heating rate in the planetary thermosphere due to stellar euv irradiation is @xmath11 the heating efficiency is less than one because part of the total incident euv energy drives ionization , dissociation and other reactions without striping out the atoms or molecules from the atmosphere .    in order to remain habitable ,",
    "@xmath12 must be low enough so that the rate of hydrogen escape from the planetary surface due to euv irradiation does not exceed a critical value that may cause the heavier constituents including oxygen to be entrained with the outflow of hydrogen .",
    "if the mixing ratio of hydrogen is low in the lower atmosphere , hydrogen escape should be limited by diffusion",
    ". therefore the critical rate of energy limited loss should be comparable to that of diffusion limited escape under such circumstance .",
    "let @xmath13 be the value of @xmath12 corresponding to the critical rate of hydrogen - loss .",
    "therefore , the necessary condition to prevent hydrogen loss at critical rate by euv irradiation can be written as : @xmath14 now we need to derive @xmath13 , the sphere - averaged , efficiency - corrected and energy - limited critical euv flux that causes hydrogen to escape at the critical rate .",
    "in order to derive the energy - limited critical euv flux @xmath13 , the formalism given by @xcite is adopted .",
    "@xcite applied this formalism to estimate the mass loss of earth s hydrogen exosphere due to solar euv irradiation .",
    "it was also used by @xcite for explaining the observed extended atmosphere for the close - in hot and giant transiting planet hd 209458b @xcite .",
    "the formalism is derived from the usual steady state equations of mass momentum and energy conservation of a dynamically expanding , non - viscous gas of constant molecular weight in which the pressure is isotropic . unlike the jean s treatment , this formalism can be applied to a dense thermosphere of hydrogen with a fixed temperature at the lower boundary located sufficiently above the homopause such that the mixing ratios of heavier gases are negligible as compared to that of hydrogen .",
    "all the euv energy is absorbed in a narrow region with visible optical depth less than unity and no euv energy is available bellow this region due to complete absorption .",
    "the rate of mass loss estimated by using this method is within a factor of few @xcite of the same provided by other models including those that involve detailed numerical solutions @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite argued that for the irradiated euv flux greater than @xmath15 erg cm @xmath16 s@xmath17 , mass loss ceases to be energy limited and becomes radiation / recombination limited . as a consequence the formalism prescribed by @xcite is not applicable in that case .",
    "the two equations that provide the maximum rate of hydrogen escape and the expansion of the atmosphere due to euv heating are given as @xcite : @xmath18 ^ 2 \\label{watson1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath19 .",
    "\\label{watson2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above equations the dimensionless parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are related with the physical parameters by @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the radius of the planet where the visible optical depth is one and the temperature is @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the radius of the region where all the euv energy is absorbed .",
    "the optical depth of the atmosphere to euv energy at the lower boundary @xmath30 is much greater than unity .",
    "@xmath31 is the sphere averaged flux of escaping particles ( escape flux of particles per steradian per second ) , @xmath32 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath33 is the total mass of the planet , @xmath34 is the mass of hydrogen atom and @xmath35 is the thermal conductivity of the gas which is parameterized by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the visible optical depth of the thermosphere such that @xmath38 .",
    "equation  ( [ watson1 ] ) and equation  ( [ watson2 ] ) need to be solved numerically for an arbitrary value of @xmath39 .",
    "however , for @xmath40 we obtain analytical solutions for @xmath41 and @xmath21 and hence @xmath12 .",
    "thus for @xmath40 , equation  ( [ watson1 ] ) gives @xmath42 substituting equation  ( [ sol1 ] ) in equation  ( [ watson2 ] ) , equation  ( [ beta ] ) gives , @xmath43 now , @xmath44 when @xmath45 in the expression for @xmath20 given in equation  ( [ xi ] ) where @xmath46 is the critical rate of hydrogen escape .",
    "hydrogen diffuses before it reaches the thermobase if the background gas of heavier species is static .",
    "this happens if the heavier species are not absorbed or can not escape at the surface . the diffusion limit for hydrogen is achieved when the heavier gases attain the maximum upward velocity such that the background becomes non - static @xcite",
    ". therefore if @xmath46 is greater than or equal to the diffusion limit , heavier species would escape .",
    "the rate of hydrogen loss limited by diffusion is given by @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 cm@xmath17s@xmath17 is the binary diffusion coefficient for the two species @xcite , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the molar mixing ratio at the exobase for hydrogen and the heavier atom with mass @xmath52 respectively and @xmath53 is the surface gravity of the planet .",
    "therefore we set @xmath54 which gives the cross over mass @xmath55 such that any species with mass less than or equal to @xmath52 would be efficiently dragged by the escaping hydrogen @xcite . in the present derivation",
    "i consider @xmath56 such that the critical rate of hydrogen loss would enable oxygen and other atoms lighter than oxygen to be dragged with the escaping gas .",
    "i assume that both hydrogen and oxygen are atomic near the exobase due to fast dissociation of the molecules by photolysis @xcite .",
    "therefore , from equation  ( [ cond ] ) we obtain , for @xmath40 @xmath57 where @xmath58 , the parameter for the planetary radius is given by equation  ( [ radius ] ) and @xmath59 the term @xmath60 in the denominator is introduced in order to include elliptical orbit with eccentricity @xmath61 .",
    "the above analytical expression is derived by taking @xmath40 . however , for a neutral gas , @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "therefore , i solve equation  ( [ watson1 ] ) and equation  ( [ watson2 ] ) numerically for different values of @xmath63 keeping all other parameters fixed .",
    "figure  1 presents the values of @xmath13 for different values of @xmath39 and shows that @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , equation  ( [ cond ] ) implies that the inequality given by equation  ( [ result ] ) is valid for any value of @xmath65 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the bolometric luminosity of a main sequence star increases with time . for a solar - type star , the bolometric luminosity increases by about 10 % in every 1 gyr .",
    "the sun was about 30% fainter in the visible light during the first billion years after its birth .",
    "on the other hand the euv luminosity is governed by the coronal activities of a star .",
    "since a star rotates faster during younger age resulting into greater coronal activities , the euv emission rate or the euv luminosity was higher in the past and it decreases with time .",
    "consequently , the rate of mass loss from the planetary surface was higher in the past . since , the value of @xmath66 in the past was greater than its present value , the condition derived here is valid for a constant rate of mass loss corresponding to the present value of @xmath67 .",
    "a time - dependent solution would have provided more stringent condition .",
    "the thermal conductivity of hydrogen @xmath68 ergs cm@xmath17s@xmath17k@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the size and the mass of the planets are usually determined from the observed parameters of the planet .",
    "transit method provides the size and the orbital inclination angle of the planet and radial velocity method provides the projected mass of the planet for known stellar mass .",
    "therefore , the two unknown parameters in equation  ( [ result ] ) are @xmath28 and @xmath9 .",
    "the lower boundary @xmath30 is located some distance above the homopause and the temperature @xmath28 at the lower boundary may be fixed at the equlibrium temperature of the planet @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in figure  2 , the above limit is weakly dependent on @xmath28 because the parameter @xmath58 is inversely proportional to @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality , @xmath28 can be fixed at 254 k , the equilibrium temperature of the earth .",
    "this makes the above expression independent of planetary albedo because derivation of equilibrium temperature requires the value of planetary albedo . with @xmath69k and taking @xmath70 and @xmath71 , i obtain @xmath72 cm@xmath16 s@xmath17 which is two orders of magnitude higher than that calculated by @xcite for the earth irradiated by solar euv radiation .",
    "this ensures the cross over mass @xmath52 is equal to @xmath74 .",
    "the total mass of hydrogen ( @xmath75 ) in the atmosphere , ocean and in the crust of the earth is about @xmath76 gm @xcite .",
    "therefore at this critical rate , an earth like planet would lose all of its surface hydrogen in about 50 myr .",
    "water molecules would be photo - dissociated into hydrogen and oxygen atoms that would subsequently escape the planet .",
    "even if the amount of water is not reduced sufficiently , such a significant loss of hydrogen and other heavier gases such as nitrogen and oxygen would make the environment drastically different than that of the present earth .",
    "@xcite have presented relationships between the stellar effective temperature @xmath77 and the normalized stellar flux @xmath9 impinging on the top of the atmosphere of an earth - like planet at the habitable zone .",
    "these relationships are applicable in the range 2600 k@xmath78 7200 k. according to these relationships , @xmath9 is minimum at @xmath79 k and increases with the increase in @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath9 also varies for different atmospheric conditions that determines the inner and the outer boundaries of the habitable zone .",
    "while condition like `` recent venus '' , `` runway greenhouse '' or `` moist greenhouse '' determines the inner boundary , condition such as `` maximum greenhouse '' or `` early mars '' determines the outer boundary of the habitable zone . since , @xmath67 in equation  ( [ result ] ) is inversely proportional to @xmath9 , i use the minimum value of @xmath9 corresponding to @xmath79k .",
    "this makes the upper limit on @xmath67 independent of the effective temperature of the star .",
    "as @xmath9 increases with the increase in @xmath77 , the value of @xmath9 corresponding to the actual @xmath77 of the star would only tighten the limit .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that according to the relationships provided by @xcite , @xmath9 increases only by 2 - 3 times with the increase in @xmath77 from 2600 k to 7200 k.    taking @xmath69 k- the equilibrium temperature of the earth , @xmath80 cm - radius of the earth , @xmath81 gm - mass of the earth , and @xmath82 @xcite , i derive , from equation  ( [ result ] ) , the upper limit on @xmath67 for planets within the outer boundary of the habitable zone .",
    "the values are presented in table  1 .",
    "for the same set of parameters the numerical solution of equation  ( [ watson1 ] ) and equation  ( [ watson2 ] ) for @xmath83 is also presented in table  1 .    .upper",
    "limit on @xmath67 for @xmath9 corresponding to @xmath84k under atmospheric conditions that determines the outer boundary of the habitable zone .",
    "for @xmath83 the results are obtained numerically . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the critical euv flux @xmath13 is less than 10 erg cm@xmath16 s@xmath17 which ensures energy - limited escape . also , equation ( [ sol1 ] ) gives the expanded radius @xmath85 for @xmath69k .",
    "estimating the stellar euv luminosities is difficult not only because the energy gets completely absorbed at the uppermost layer of the earth s atmosphere but also due to photoelectric absorption by the interstellar medium along the line of sight . using the rosat space telescope , @xcite estimated the euv luminosities of a large number of nearby stars with spectral type ranging from f to m . here",
    ", i use the bolometric and euv luminosities of planet - hosting stars of spectral type ranging from a to m , given by @xcite who derived the euv and bolometric luminosities by using the data from rosat , xmm - newton and chandra space telescopes .",
    "i have considered only those stars that are older than 1 gyr .",
    "it is found that out of all such stars , only two of the planet - hosting m stars satisfies the criteria presented in this work .",
    "the value of @xmath66 for 2mass 1207 ( spectral type m8 ) is @xmath86 . for gj 317 ( m3.5 ) ,",
    "gj 674 ( m2.5 ) and for gj 176 ( m2.5v ) , the values of @xmath67 are @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 respectively .",
    "therefore , none of these m stars can have a planet with habitable environment .",
    "gj 832 ( m1.5v ) has @xmath90 and so it marginally satisfies the habitability criteria .",
    "however , since the effective temperature of this m1.5v spectral type star is higher than 2600k , this planet should also be considered uninhabitable .",
    "on the other hand the values of @xmath67 for gj 436 ( m2.5 ) and gj 876 ( m4v ) are @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively .",
    "therefore , these two m stars satisfies the euv habitability criteria provided in table  1 .",
    "this is expected because m stars are the faintest among stars of all spectral types . as a consequence",
    "the hz of m stars is located very near to the stars and hence a planet in the habitable zone is exposed to strong euv radiation .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that a rocky planet in the habitable zone of m stars may lose much of its volatiles during the formation because the pre - main sequence phase of such stars are comparatively longer .",
    "however , if the planet accretes sufficiently large amount of water during formation or if it were formed far away from the star and then migrated to the hz , it may remain habitable @xcite .",
    "but strong euv irradiation should make it uninhabitable .",
    "however , planet hosting stars of all other spectral types listed by @xcite have @xmath67 much lower than the upper limits provided here .",
    "the values of @xmath67 for gj 86 ( k1v ) is @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , according to the present upper limit , this star marginally satisfies the habitability criteria of having sufficient amount of water . on the other hand , the values of @xmath67 for hd 87883 ( k0v ) , @xmath10 eridani ( k2v ) , hd 46375 ( k1v ) , hd 93083 ( k3v ) , hd 130322 ( k0v ) , hd 189733 ( k1-k2 ) and hd 218566 ( k3v ) are @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 respectively .",
    "so , all of them satisfies the upper limit for @xmath67 .",
    "hence , the upper limit presented here is important in deciding the habitability of planets around m stars .",
    "note that the numerical values of the parameters involved in the present habitability condition do not differ much from that of the earth .",
    "the density of a rocky planet should be about 4.0 - 5.5 gm@xmath101 .",
    "therefore , the radius of a rocky planet does not exceed 1.6 times the earth s radius and the mass must be less than 5 times the earth s mass @xcite .",
    "more massive planets are neptune and jupiter types of gaseous planets @xcite .",
    "therefore , a large value of @xmath67 for m stars may rule out the presence of habitable planets around them .    owing to our poor knowledge on the actual environment of exoplanets ,",
    "the habitability of rocky planets around the habitable zone remains ambiguous and incomplete .",
    "however , we must impose as many conditions as can be determined directly and easily in order to narrow down our search for planets that may possibly harbor life .",
    "the present result provides such an important condition as it depends on two observable quantities of the planet hosting star - the bolometric and euv luminosities .",
    "spectra of habitable planets around m - type stars that do not satisfy the euv criteria presented here should show lack of hydrogen , nitrogen and oxygen in their atmosphere and hence can confirm the limit presented here .",
