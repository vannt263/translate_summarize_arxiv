    "<S> the spectrum of the hermitian hamiltonian @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , which describes the quantum anharmonic oscillator , is real and positive . </S>",
    "<S> the non - hermitian quantum - mechanical hamiltonian @xmath2 , where the coupling constant @xmath3 is real and positive , is @xmath4-symmetric . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , the spectrum of @xmath5 is known to be real and positive as well . here </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that there is a significant difference between these two theories : when @xmath3 is sufficiently small , the latter hamiltonian exhibits a two - particle bound state while the former does not . </S>",
    "<S> the bound state persists in the corresponding non - hermitian @xmath4-symmetric @xmath6 quantum field theory for all dimensions @xmath7 but is not present in the conventional hermitian @xmath8 field theory .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we show that the spectrum of the non - hermitian ) ] . ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4-symmetric quartic hamiltonian @xmath9 possesses bound states for sufficiently small @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , when the euclidean space - time dimension @xmath10 satisfies @xmath7 , the corresponding @xmath11-symmetric quantum field theory described by the lagrangian @xmath12 also possesses bound states for small @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the related conventional hermitian @xmath13 and @xmath8 theories with @xmath1 do not possess such bound states .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum - mechanical hamiltonians that are non - hermitian but possess @xmath4 symmetry have recently been studied in great detail by many authors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the entire spectrum of the @xmath4-symmetric anharmonic oscillator is real and positive . </S>",
    "<S> the first proof of the reality of the spectrum is given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> direct numerical evidence for the reality and positivity of the spectrum can be found by performing a runge - kutta integration of the associated schrdinger equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the large - energy eigenvalues of the spectrum can be calculated with great accuracy by using conventional wkb techniques @xcite . an easy way to demonstrate </S>",
    "<S> the reality and positivity of the spectrum is to calculate exactly the spectral zeta function ( the sum of the inverses of the eigenvalues ) . </S>",
    "<S> this was done by mezincescu and bender and wang @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculations that are performed in this paper are perturbative ; that is , quantities are determined as formal power series in the coupling constant @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> some explanation must be given to justify the application of perturbative methods to @xmath4-symmetric theories . </S>",
    "<S> we will argue that to obtain a perturbation expansion for the theories described in ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) we need only calculate the perturbation series for the corresponding quantity in the conventional hermitian @xmath13 and @xmath8 theories and change the sign of @xmath3 in these expansions . this procedure is correct but it is nontrivial , as we now argue .    first , consider the quantum - mechanical theory in ( [ e1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding differential equation for the energy eigenfunctions @xmath14 is @xmath15 where the wave function @xmath14 satisfies boundary conditions in two wedges of @xmath16 opening angle in the complex-@xmath17 plane @xcite : @xmath18 these two wedges lie just below the real axis . because they are symmetric with respect to the imaginary axis they enforce the @xmath4 symmetry of the problem . in the limit as @xmath19 , the differential equation in ( [ e2a ] ) </S>",
    "<S> becomes that of the harmonic oscillator and the boundary conditions are imposed in two wedges of @xmath20 opening angle in the complex-@xmath17 plane : @xmath21 because the wedges for @xmath1 and the wedges for @xmath22 have a region in common , conventional perturbative methods are justified </S>",
    "<S> .    however , one must be extremely careful to avoid drawing wrong conclusions on the basis of perturbative calculations . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a perturbative calculation of the one - point green s function ( the expectation value of @xmath17 in the ground state ) gives @xmath23 to all orders in powers of the coupling constant @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the correct result is nonzero , pure imaginary , and exponentially small @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a positive constant . </S>",
    "<S> the nonperturbative result in ( [ e2d ] ) is due to a soliton solution of the classical field equations .    </S>",
    "<S> there are even more subtle effects in which one may think that there are nonperturbative effects when there are none . </S>",
    "<S> for example , consider the cubic anharmonic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath26 a perturbative calculation of the ground - state energy has the form @xmath27 the coefficients @xmath28 in this series are real and all have the _ same sign _ and thus the series is not borel summable . </S>",
    "<S> the nonsummability of this series indicates the presence of a branch cut in the complex-@xmath3 plane on the real-@xmath3 axis . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the function @xmath29 is complex when @xmath3 is real . </S>",
    "<S> the imaginary part of @xmath29 is a nonperturbative effect ; it is exponentially small when @xmath3 is real and small . </S>",
    "<S> the energies of the cubic oscillator are complex because of tunneling effects on the real axis .    the corresponding @xmath4-symmetric cubic oscillator , whose hamiltonian is @xmath30 is obtained from the hamiltonian in ( [ e2e ] ) by replacing @xmath3 with @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> this replacement makes the series in ( [ e2f ] ) borel summable @xcite and verifies the result that eigenvalues of @xmath5 in ( [ e2 g ] ) are all _ real_.    however , this argument is quite tricky . </S>",
    "<S> let us apply the same reasoning to the conventional hermitian quantum - mechanical anharmonic oscillator described by @xmath32 the rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation series for the ground - state energy of this hamiltonian has the form @xmath33 where the coefficients @xmath28 are all real and alternate in sign . </S>",
    "<S> hence , this series is borel summable and we conclude ( correctly ) that the ground - state energy is real when @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we correctly obtain the perturbation expansion for the ground - state energy of the non - hermitian @xmath4-symmetric anharmonic oscillator ( [ e1 ] ) by replacing @xmath3 with @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> now , the coefficients in perturbation series for the ground - state energy no longer alternate in sign ; the coefficients all have the same sign ( they are all negative ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , all of the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) are real . </S>",
    "<S> even though the series is not borel summable , the imaginary part of the ground - state energy is _ exactly zero _ due to the presence of the soliton that leads to the nonperturbative result in ( [ e2d ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the same discussion applies to the non - hermitian @xmath4-symmetric quantum field theory in ( [ e2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbation expansions of the green s functions of this theory are obtained using the same feynman rules as for the conventional @xmath8 quantum field theory , with the one change that the vertex amplitude @xmath35 is replaced with @xmath36 . however , again one must be very careful about nonperturbative effects . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the one - point green s function , which vanishes in the conventional @xmath8 quantum field theory , is now nonvanishing , pure imaginary , and exponentially small in the @xmath6 quantum field theory @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> having made these preliminary remarks , we turn to the question of bound states in @xmath4-symmetric theories . </S>",
    "<S> let us first examine a two - particle state for the conventional quantum anharmonic oscillator hamiltonian ( [ e3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the small-@xmath3 rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation series for the @xmath37th energy level @xmath38 of this hamiltonian is @xcite @xmath39\\qquad(\\epsilon\\to0^+ ) , \\label{e4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dimensionless expansion parameter is @xmath40 . in this theory the _ renormalized mass _ @xmath41 </S>",
    "<S> is defined as the first excitation above the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> thus , from ( [ e4 ] ) , @xmath42\\qquad ( \\epsilon\\to0^+ ) . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{e5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to determine if the two - particle state is bound , we examine the second excitation above the ground state using ( [ e4 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath43\\qquad ( \\epsilon\\to0^+ ) . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{e6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath44 , then a two - particle bound state exists and the binding energy , which is a negative quantity , is @xmath45 . if @xmath46 , then the second excitation above the vacuum is interpreted as an unbound two - particle state . </S>",
    "<S> we can see from ( [ e6 ] ) that in the small - coupling region , where perturbation theory is valid , the conventional anharmonic oscillator does not possess a bound state . indeed , using a variety of methods ( wkb theory , variational methods , numerical calculations ) </S>",
    "<S> one can show that there is no two - particle bound state for any value of @xmath1 . because there is no bound state the @xmath13 interaction </S>",
    "<S> may be considered to represent a repulsive force . </S>",
    "<S> needed to create two particles at a given time is more than twice the energy @xmath41 needed to create one particle . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the perturbation series for the @xmath4-symmetric oscillator , whose hamiltonian @xmath5 is given in ( [ e1 ] ) , from the perturbation series for the conventional anharmonic oscillator by replacing @xmath47 with @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , while the conventional anharmonic oscillator does not possess a two - particle bound state , evidently the @xmath4-symmetric oscillator does indeed possess such a state . </S>",
    "<S> the binding energy of this state can be measured in units of the renormalized mass @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose we define the _ dimensionless _ binding energy @xmath49 by @xmath50 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f1 ] , @xmath49 is plotted as a function of the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath47 . observe that the bound state disappears when the value of @xmath47 increases beyond @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath47 continues to increase , @xmath49 reaches a maximum value of @xmath52 at @xmath53 and then approaches the limiting value @xmath54 as @xmath55 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting that the bound state for the @xmath4-symmetric anharmonic oscillator occurs only for values of @xmath47 less than about @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the following heuristic argument helps to explain why the characteristic size of @xmath47 is so small . for the hamiltonian in ( [ e1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> the potential has the form @xmath57 . on the real-@xmath17 axis , </S>",
    "<S> the maximum value of @xmath58 occurs at @xmath59 and at this point @xmath60 . in order to have a two - particle bound state </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary for the height of the potential to be high enough to bind three states , the largest of which is of order @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> setting this value equal to @xmath62 gives @xmath63 , which is near the value for which the two - particle state is most strongly bound . </S>",
    "<S> note that the potential @xmath58 does not allow states to tunnel out of the well , even though the potential decreases for large real @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the @xmath4-symmetric boundary conditions are not imposed on the real axis but rather in a pair of wedges in the complex-@xmath17 plane that lie below the real axis [ see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e2b ] ) ] .    in the @xmath4-symmetric anharmonic oscillator , there are not only two - particle bound states for small coupling constant but also @xmath37-particle bound states for all @xmath64 . to see why </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the energy of the @xmath37th excitation above the vacuum : @xmath65\\qquad(\\epsilon\\to0 + ) , \\label{e8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the generalization of ( [ e6 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the dimensionless binding energy is @xmath66 this equation reduces to ( [ e7 ] ) when @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the key feature of this equation is that the coefficient of @xmath47 is negative . </S>",
    "<S> since the dimensionless binding energy becomes negative as @xmath47 increases from @xmath23 , there is a @xmath37-particle bound state . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensionless binding energies for the first five @xmath37-particle bound states are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that the higher multiparticle bound states cease to be bound for smaller values of @xmath47 ; starting with the three - particle bound state , the binding energy of these states becomes positive as @xmath47 increases past @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the heuristic argument given above for the value of @xmath47 at which the multiparticle states are most strongly bound is qualitatively correct ; one can see that the @xmath37-particle bound state is most strongly bound at a value of @xmath47 that is roughly @xmath72 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ f2 ] shows that for any value of @xmath40 there are always a finite number of bound states and an infinite number of unbound states . </S>",
    "<S> the number of bound states decreases with increasing @xmath47 until , as we see in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f1 ] , there are no bound states at all . </S>",
    "<S> observe that there is a range of @xmath47 for which there are only two- and three - particle bound states . </S>",
    "<S> ( this situation is analogous to the physical world in which one observes only states of two and three bound quarks . ) in this range of @xmath47 if one has an initial state containing a number of particles ( renormalized masses ) , these particles will clump together into bound states , releasing energy in the process . depending on the value of @xmath47 </S>",
    "<S> , the final state will consist either of two- or of three - particle bound states , whichever is energetically favored . </S>",
    "<S> note also that there is a special value of @xmath47 for which two- and three - particle bound states can exist in thermodynamic equilibrium .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now generalize the result for the quantum - mechanical two - particle bound state in ( [ e7 ] ) to the case of the @xmath10-dimensional @xmath4-symmetric quantum field theory in ( [ e2 ] ) . to show that there is a bound state , we need only demonstrate that _ to leading order in the coupling constant _ , the binding energy becomes negative as the coupling constant increases from @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the feynman rules for the calculation are the conventional ones , except that the sign of the vertex is reversed : @xmath36 for a four - point vertex amplitude and @xmath73 for a line amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> note that to leading order in the coupling constant we use the renormalized mass @xmath41 rather than the unrenormalized mass @xmath74 in the propagator amplitude and we exclude self - energy loops in the graphs .    to calculate the energy of the bound state to leading order we sum up all `` sausage - link '' graphs and identify the bound - state pole in the geometric series . </S>",
    "<S> these graphs are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the result for the dimensionless binding energy to leading order in the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath75 is @xmath76^{2/(3-d ) } \\epsilon^{2/(3-d ) } , \\label{e10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the euclidean space dimension . </S>",
    "<S> the formula reduces to that in ( [ e7 ] ) for the case @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> this formula is valid for @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> note that we have performed a mass renormalization to leading order , but we have not done a wave function or coupling - constant renormalization in this calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by remarking that the behavior of a @xmath78 theory is the reverse of that of a @xmath8 theory . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath78 theory represents an attractive force . </S>",
    "<S> the bound states that arise as a consequence of this force can be found by using the bethe - salpeter equation . however , the @xmath78 field theory is unacceptable because the spectrum is not bounded below . </S>",
    "<S> if we replace @xmath3 by @xmath31 , the spectrum now becomes real and positive , but the force becomes repulsive and there are no bound states . </S>",
    "<S> the same is true for a two - scalar theory with interaction of the form @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> this latter theory is an acceptable model of scalar electrodynamics , but has no analog of positronium . </S>"
