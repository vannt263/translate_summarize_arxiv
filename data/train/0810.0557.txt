    "theoretical properties of simulated annealing  @xcite have been extensively studied in the 1980s  @xcite .",
    "one of the main issues in those research activities was regarding the annealing schedule : how should one decrease temperature @xmath0 as a function of time @xmath1 in order to finally arrive at a globally optimum solution ?",
    "geman and geman  @xcite were the first to obtain an answer , which states a sufficient condition of the form @xmath2 .",
    "the inverse - logarithm scaling turned out to be universal , in the sense that it is also sufficient for many variants of simulated annealing and some other algorithms .",
    "hajek  @xcite proved a necessary and sufficient condition which also has the inverse - logarithm form , showing that one can not do the cooling any faster than that while guaranteeing global optimality .",
    "somma et al . , in their recent contribution  @xcite , have shown that the inverse - logarithm scaling of simulated annealing can also be obtained via the adiabatic condition  @xcite of a related quantum - mechanical system .",
    "the relationship between the original markov chain in simulated annealing and the quantum system is established via the so - called classical - quantum mapping or quantum - classical correspondence  @xcite . in this paper , we discuss a classical reformulation of quantum equivalent of a classical markov chain with detailed balance , in order to elucidate mathematical structure of the correspondence between a markov chain and its quantum equivalent , without making reference to quantum mechanics . we also discuss another classical reformulation of the argument deriving the optimal inverse - logarithm scaling of annealing schedule  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , which is based on the quantum adiabatic theorem .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we first provide a basic formulation of classical markov chains with detailed balance , and derive its @xmath3-representation .",
    "a local linear approximation of the time evolution in terms of @xmath3-representation is also discussed .",
    "our derivation of the inverse - logarithm scaling of simulated annealing is discussed in section 3 .",
    "a `` chasing '' view of simulated annealing , that is based on the local linear approximation based on the 0-representation , and a bound of the largest negative eigenvalue are used in the derivation . in section 4",
    "we discuss relation between our formulation and the stochastic matrix form decomposition , which is defined and discussed extensively in  @xcite .",
    "section 5 concludes the paper .",
    "let @xmath4 denote a state space , which is a finite set of cardinarity @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 be an `` energy function '' defined on @xmath4 , which associates a state @xmath7 with its energy @xmath8 .",
    "then , one can define a probability distribution on @xmath4 , in terms of a probability vector @xmath9 , as @xmath10 which is the gibbs - boltzmann distribution induced by the energy function @xmath6 , with @xmath11 a parameter corresponding to the inverse temperature .",
    "let us consider a undirected graph @xmath12 with @xmath4 its vertex set and an edge set @xmath13 .",
    "we assume @xmath12 to be a connected graph , without self - edge ( loop ) .",
    "we define a transition matrix @xmath14 as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a symmetric matrix with @xmath17 for @xmath18 . on the basis of the transition matrix @xmath19",
    ", one can define a continuous - time markov chain , as @xmath20 the connectedness of the graph @xmath12 induces irreducibility of the markov chain .",
    "the markov chain is also aperiodic , so that it is ergodic , and therefore bears a unique equilibrium distribution .",
    "the gibbs - boltzmann distribution  ( [ eq : gbdist ] ) is the equilibrium distribution of the markov chain , since @xmath21 holds .",
    "the formulation presented here is general , including various typical systems as special cases .",
    "for example , conventional ising spin systems are described by letting @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath13 having an @xmath24-dimensional hypercubic structure .",
    "metropolis and glauber dynamics are implemented by letting @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively , as mentioned in  @xcite .",
    "we discuss a different representation of the continuous - time markov chain  ( [ eq : mc ] ) , in view of the classical - to - quantum mapping utilized in  @xcite .",
    "although the quantum reformulation mapped from a classical markov chain makes use of square roots of probabilities @xmath27 , we here discuss a slightly more generalized expression which is based on the so - called @xmath3-representation of @xmath28 .",
    "* definition*. we define the @xmath3-representation @xmath29 of @xmath28 as @xmath30    the concept of @xmath3-representation is originally introduced in information geometry  @xcite , in order to discuss intrinsic geometrical structures of statistical manifolds .",
    "taking square roots of probabilities corresponds to considering 0-representation .",
    "although not used in this paper , 1-representation is defined as @xmath31    we next derive an expression of the markov chain in terms of the @xmath3-representation .",
    "one has @xmath32 which is rewritten , in a vector - matrix form , as @xmath33 where the matrix @xmath34 is defined as @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "clearly , eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath34 are the same as those of @xmath19 .",
    "the elements of the matrix @xmath37 are given by @xmath38 and consequently , @xmath39 the above expression evidently shows that the 0-representation is special in our formulation , in that the matrix @xmath40 becomes symmetric when @xmath41 , that is , under the 0-representation .",
    "the fact that the 0-representation symmetrizes the transition matrix @xmath19 was also mentioned in  @xcite , in order to state that eigenvalues of @xmath19 are all real .",
    "it should be noted that the matrix @xmath42 is dependent on @xmath43 via @xmath44 and therefore @xmath45 does not symmetric at @xmath46 in general .",
    "we discuss linearization of the @xmath3-representation of the dynamical equation .",
    "starting from the nonlinear dynamics @xmath47 and considering a small perturbation @xmath48 around @xmath43 , we obtain the following linearized system which describes time evolution of @xmath48 : @xmath49\\delta\\psi^{(\\alpha)}_i+o\\left(\\|\\delta\\bm{\\psi}^{(\\alpha)}\\|\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in particular , observing that the second term of the right - hand side of  ( [ eq : linearization ] ) vanishes at the gibbs - boltzmann distribution @xmath50 , irrespective of the value of @xmath3 , the linearization around the equilibrium point becomes , ignoring higher - order terms , @xmath51 equation  ( [ eq : lin_at_gb ] ) states that the matrix @xmath52 governs the local dynamics described in terms of @xmath3-representation in the vicinity of the equilibrium distribution @xmath50 .",
    "it should be noted that the right - hand side of  ( [ eq : linearization ] ) is in general not a projection of @xmath53 onto the manifold of probability distributions in @xmath3-representation , defined as @xmath54",
    "with the inverse temperature @xmath55 fixed , the distribution following the markov chain relaxes toward the gibbs - boltzmann distribution . the basic idea behind simulated annealing is that by gradually reducing the temperature one can arrive at a distribution which concentrates on a set of minimum - energy states .",
    "thus , by performing simulations of the markov chain with a proper cooling schedule , one expects to obtain minimum - energy states with probability close to 1 .",
    "one of the basic questions regarding simulated annealing is to determine the cooling schedule which guarantees convergence to minimum - energy states .",
    "we wish to study this problem via the linearized local dynamics in @xmath3-representation  ( [ eq : lin_at_gb ] ) , with @xmath41 .",
    "intuitively , our expectation is that if simulated annealing works well the distribution should stay very close to instantaneous equilibrium distributions as @xmath55 is changed slowly enough .",
    "if it is the case , then arguments that are based on the local linear approximation around the equilibrium  ( [ eq : lin_at_gb ] ) will be justified .",
    "since the coefficient matrix @xmath56 is symmetric , all eigenvalues are real , so that the local dynamics around equilibrium is a simple linear relaxation toward the equilibrium , with negative eigenvalues of @xmath56 govern the speed of relaxation . in simulated annealing the instantaneous equilibium distribution",
    "is also slowly drifting as @xmath55 changes .",
    "one can therefore expect to obtain a minimum - energy distribution only if the drift is slow enough so that the relaxation process is managed to catch up with the drift .",
    "what is important for successful convergence of simulated annealing is thus the largest negative eigenvalue of @xmath56 .",
    "we let @xmath57 where @xmath58 , with @xmath59 and @xmath60 , is to make diagonal elements of @xmath61 nondiverging as @xmath55 gets large , and where @xmath62 is chosen so that @xmath63 becomes a non - negative matrix .",
    "irreducibility of the original markov chain guarantees @xmath64 to be a ( strictly ) positive matrix .",
    "the following theorem for positive matrices , due to hopf  @xcite in its operator form , is applied to obtain an upper bound of the largest negative eigenvalue .",
    "let @xmath65 be a square matrix that is positive , i.e. , @xmath66 holds for all @xmath67 .",
    "then the maximum eigenvalue @xmath68 of @xmath69 and any other eigenvalues @xmath70 satisfy the inequality @xmath71 where @xmath72    all positive elements of the matrix @xmath63 are bounded from below by @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , and @xmath75 actually gives the lower bound for not too small values of @xmath55 .",
    "a lower bound of the minimum element of @xmath64 is thus @xmath76 .",
    "alternatively , the matrix @xmath63 is upper bounded componentwise by the matrix @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is an all-1 matrix , so that an upper bound of the maximum element of @xmath64 is given by @xmath79 .",
    "an upper bound of the parameter @xmath80 is therefore evaluated as @xmath81 note that symmetry of the matrix @xmath63 , and hence of @xmath64 , makes the argument of bounding @xmath80 straightforward , thereby demonstrating efficiency of the 0-representation .",
    "let @xmath70 be a negative eigenvalue of @xmath56 .",
    "since we know that @xmath56 has a zero eigenvalue which is the largest , applying theorem 1 yields @xmath82 and consequently , @xmath83 } \\le-\\frac{b(w_{\\rm min}\\chi)^n}{n(3n)^n},\\ ] ] where we used the inequality @xmath84^{1/n}\\ge2/[n(\\kappa+1)]$ ] for @xmath85 . to make clear its dependence on @xmath55 , we rewrite it as @xmath86 where we have taken into account possible dependence of @xmath87 on @xmath55 , by assuming that @xmath88 holds .",
    "from now on we assume the inverse temperature @xmath55 to be a function of time @xmath1 , and consider speed of drift of the instantaneous equilibrium distribution @xmath89 .",
