    "quasars are very luminous objects residing at the centers of galaxies believed to be powered by accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole .",
    "the high luminosity makes them identifiable out to very high redshift where they can be used to study black hole growth , galaxy evolution and the intergalactic medium .",
    "it has been discovered that most nearby , massive galaxies harbor central supermassive black holes and that the mass of the black hole scales with galaxy properties such as bulge luminosity ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) and velocity dispersion ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "these observations suggest that black holes play an important role in galaxy evolution , likely due to feedback which heats and expels gas which would otherwise form stars in the galaxy ( silk & rees 1998 ; di matteo et al .",
    "2005 , hopkins et al . 2006a",
    "; croton et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the physical details of how the energy emitted by the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) couples to the gas are still poorly understood .",
    "the relic black hole mass function at low redshift is the result of all the black hole growth via accretion and merging over cosmic time .",
    "there is good agreement between the number density of black holes at low redshift and the observed accretion as inferred by studies of agn luminosity functions if black holes accrete with a mass - to - energy conversion efficiency in the range @xmath8 ( yu & tremaine 2002 ; marconi et al .",
    "2004 ; hopkins et al . 2007 ; shankar et al .",
    "such studies also agree with luminosity function observations at various redshifts ( e.g. ueda et al . 2003 ) that there is _ downsizing _ in the agn population , that the more massive black holes were built up more rapidly at high - redshift than the less massive black holes which accreted a greater fraction of their mass at lower redshift .",
    "reverberation mapping of broad - lined agns at low - redshift has shown that a relationship exists between the distance of the line - emitting gas from the central ionizing sources , @xmath9 , and the optical / uv luminosity , @xmath10 ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ; bentz et al .",
    "this has the form @xmath11 , as expected based on simple ionization models .",
    "the consequence of this relationship is that measurement of the velocity of the line - emitting gas , e.g. via its doppler - broadened linewidth , and the luminosity are sufficient to determine the gravitational mass of the central black hole ( wandel et al .",
    "such measurements can be made with single epoch , moderate signal - to - noise ( s / n ) spectra out to very high redshifts .",
    "this method appears to give a fairly low scatter ( between 0.2 to 0.3 dex for the h@xmath12  and mgii  lines ; kollmeier et al .",
    "2006 ; fine et al . 2008 ; shen et al .",

    "most of these are from the main sdss sample of fan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) which contains very luminous quasars .",
    "these results show that the most luminous @xmath3 quasars contain black hole masses @xmath13 accreting at close to the eddington limit .",
    "this is not too surprising because if they were to accrete at substantially below the eddington limit , the required black hole masses would be @xmath14 and such black holes are rare even at more moderate redshifts ( mclure & dunlop 2004 ; vestergaard & osmer 2009 ) .",
    "if there are sub - eddington accreting black holes at @xmath3 they would be found in the lower luminosity quasar samples such as the sdss deep stripe ( jiang et al .",
    "2009 ) and canada - france high-@xmath0 quasar survey ( cfhqs ; willott et al .",
    "two of the sdss deep stripe quasars have black hole mass measurements and both are found to have lower black hole masses than the sdss main quasars and are accreting at approximately the eddington limit ( kurk et al . 2007 ; 2009 ) . in order to increase the numbers of low luminosity quasars with black hole mass measurements and determine",
    "if any of them are powered by high mass black holes accreting at low eddington ratios , we are carrying out a near - ir spectroscopy program on all @xmath15 cfhqs quasars .",
    "the existence of @xmath13 black holes at redshift 6 has led to much theoretical work to explain how such objects can be built up in the @xmath16 gyr of cosmic time available .",
    "standard eddington - limited accretion has an e - folding time ( the salpeter time - scale ) of @xmath17yr assuming efficiency @xmath18 .",
    "this led some people to propose that episodes of super - eddington accretion at very high redshift were necessary ( volonteri & rees 2005 ; kawakatu & wada 2009 ) . another possibility is higher efficiency which lowers the salpeter time - scale and may be expected for rapidly spinning black holes ( shapiro 2005 ) .",
    "other studies have shown that eddington - limited accretion can account for these black holes , but only if very massive seed black holes or multiple stellar seeds are invoked ( yoo & miralda - escud 2004 ; sijacki et al .",
    "mergers are also an important part of the growth of the most massive black holes at high redshift ( volonteri & rees 2006 ; li et al .",
    "2007 ) .    an important prediction of galaxy evolution models is the evolution of the black hole mass  stellar mass relation .",
    "there have been many attempts at observational determinations of this ratio , however selection effects are critical .",

    "this spectrum shows several other characteristics of @xmath15 quasars .",
    "there is a sharp break in the continuum level across the ly@xmath39  line due to foreground neutral hydrogen absorption .",

    "shortward of the expected location of ly@xmath12  there is complete absorption again .",
    "there is a possible nv  broad emission line which is marked on figure [ fig : spec ] .    in the following section we will describe near - ir spectroscopy of a sample of cfhqs quasars .",
    "one of the quasars observed is cfhqsj0210 - 0456 .",
    "although this quasar is extremely faint in the near - ir , a 4 hours integration with niri on gemini - north allowed the detection of the mgii  @xmath42 emission line ( figure [ fig : nirispec ] ) .",

    "this is statistically identical to the redshift of the peak of ly@xmath39 .",

    "2010 ) and will be investigated in a future paper .",
    "this redshift of @xmath44 is the highest of any known quasar , just surpassing sdssj1148 + 5251 at @xmath45 ( fan et al .",
    "2003 ; walter et al . 2003 ) and cfhqsj2329 - 0301 at @xmath46 ( section [ nirspec ] ) .",
    "the accurate redshift for cfhqsj0210 - 0456 allows us to measure the size of the ionized region in front of the quasar via the physical extent of measurable flux on the blue side of ly@xmath39 .",
    "this can give important information on the ionization state of the igm surrounding the quasar ( cen & haiman 2000 ; wyithe & loeb 2004 ; bolton & haehnelt 2007 ) .",
    "the spectrum of cfhqsj0210 - 0456 reaches zero flux at 9005  , which corresponds to a ionized near - zone size of just 1.7 proper mpc .",
    "note that using the wavelength at which the transmission reaches 10% , as used by fan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , rather than where the flux reaches zero , gives almost exactly the same size due to the steepness of the spectrum .",
    "given this small size and steep drop , we do not bin the spectrum in 20   bins ( as fan et al . did )",
    "since then the measured size would be very dependent upon the choice of bins .",
    "this size of 1.7 mpc is extremely small , much smaller than any other known @xmath3 quasars with the exception of lineless or bal quasars and less than the typical size for sdss quasars at @xmath47 of 5 mpc ( carilli et al .",
    "note however that if these near - zone sizes are set by the expansion of an ionization front from the quasar then they are expected to scale with the quasar luminosity as @xmath48 .",
    "since cfhqsj0210 - 0456 has a luminosity a factor of ten lower than sdss quasars , then the luminosity - scaled near - zone size is consistent with that expected based on the near - zone sizes of the sdss @xmath47 quasars .",
    "further exploration of the near - zone size and other constraints on the ionization state of the igm using this quasar will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we are attempting @xmath49-band spectroscopy of all cfhqs quasars with redshifts @xmath15 .",
    "we do not target the @xmath50 quasars because the mgii  line center lies at wavelengths @xmath51 m and there is substantial atmospheric absorption shortward of this wavelength which could affect determining a reliable continuum and line width .",
    "of the 20 quasars found in the cfhqs so far , 5 were not targeted because they had @xmath50 .",
    "two @xmath15 quasars have not yet been targeted due to their recent discovery .",
    "therefore a total of 13 quasars have had near - ir spectroscopy attempted .",
    "one quasar , cfhqsj1509 - 1749 , already has a published near - ir spectrum from the gnirs instrument at gemini - south ( willott et al .",
    "near - infrared spectroscopy of the other 12 quasars was obtained using the niri instrument on the gemini - north telescope .",
    "the @xmath49-band grism covers the wavelength range @xmath52 m at a resolution of @xmath53 ( 570 @xmath54 ) with the 0.75 arcsec slit .",
    "the seeing was generally good  in the range 0.5 to 0.7 arcsec .",
    "the observations of each target were split into 300second frames nodded along the slit to enable good sky subtraction and bad pixel rejection .",
    "all frames were checked for the fixed pattern noise problem that randomly affects some niri exposures . any pattern noise affected frames or frames taken in variable sky conditions were discarded .",
    "total usable integration times ranged from 1.3 to 4 hours with an average of 2.8 hours .",
    "data reduction followed standard near - ir longslit procedures which will be briefly described here .",

    "most apparent absorption lines are at wavelengths of night sky emission lines where the noise is higher",
    ". these will not strongly affect the fitted mgii  emission lines because such data points have low weight in the fit .    the spectra consist of 3 possible components : a power law continuum , a doppler - broadened blend of many iron emission lines and the mgii  2799  emission line doublet .",
    "a simultaneous fit to these three components was carried out .",
    "the iron line emission template is from mclure & dunlop ( 2004 ) and covers the spectral range 2100  3085 ",
    ". therefore only data in this rest - frame wavelength range was included in the fit .",

    "as noted in section [ nirspec ] , the spectra have differing s / n due to the fact that some of these quasars are very faint .",
    "therefore we have to consider whether the quasars with low s / n might have their line width measurements biased high or low due to this .",

    "this strong correlation is particularly interesting because it is not seen at lower redshifts ( fine et al .",
    "2008 ; shen et al .",
    "2008 ) where there is essentially no change in fwhm with luminosity .",
    "the fact that there was no correlation of fwhm with luminosity could cast doubt on the reliability of the virial black hole mass estimation method since correlations between @xmath60 and luminosity are driven by the fact that luminosity enters the equation used to estimate @xmath60 .",
    "the reason that , at lower redshifts , there is no correlation between fwhm and luminosity is because the quasars are accreting at a very wide range of eddington ratios ( shen et al .",
    "as we are about to show , this is not the case at @xmath3 .",
    "the eddington luminosity is defined as the maximum luminosity attainable due to outward radiation pressure acting on infalling material and is @xmath134 w. the observed monochromatic luminosity @xmath59 is only a fraction of the total electromagnetic luminosity coming from the quasar , so a bolometric correction is applied to calculate the bolometric luminosity , @xmath135 , from @xmath59 .",
    "we use a bolometric correction factor of 6.0 , consistent with previous work ( richards et al .",
    "2006 ; jiang et al .",
    "the ratio of the bolometric luminosity to the eddington luminosity for a given black hole mass is often called the eddington ratio and is defined as @xmath136 .    the right panel of figure [ fig : bhmassfwhmlum ] plots @xmath60 against @xmath59 .",
    "there is a strong positive correlation showing that more luminous quasars have greater black hole masses .",

    "observations such as the transverse proximity effect ( jakobsen et al . 2003 ; worseck et al .",

    "the absence of sub - eddington quasars suggests that most quasars at this epoch are in the process of the exponential build - up of their central black holes and have not reached the later phase of quasar activity where the accretion rate declines .",

    "in the previous section we determined the intrinsic distribution of eddington ratios for supermassive black holes at @xmath3 and also discussed their lifetimes and duty cycles . the fact that almost all black holes at @xmath3 appear to be active and accreting at rates approaching , or even exceeding , their eddington rates means that it is a relatively trivial procedure to use the observed luminosity function of quasars to determine the underlying black hole mass distribution .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation at lower redshifts where a considerable fraction of black holes may have passed their peak activity or be going through a pause in activity and therefore one can either determine the _ active _ black hole mass function ( vestergaard et al .",

    "we note that because the @xmath3 quasars appear to be accreting close to the eddington limit , this correction would be so large that it would shift the entire black hole mass function to higher masses by 1 dex .",
    "this would then give the exponential cutoff in the mass function at @xmath216 .",
    "it does not seem plausible that the mass function at @xmath3 would contain such a large number of @xmath217 black holes given the lack of such black holes at low redshift ( tundo et al .",
    "2007 ) , at @xmath24 ( mclure & dunlop 2004 ; vestergaard & osmer 2009 ) , self - regulation arguments ( natarajan & treister 2009 ) and the difficulty of forming them in the cosmological time available by @xmath3 ( volonteri & rees 2006 ) . the issue of whether or not one should make radiation pressure modifications to virial black hole mass estimates is also discussed by peterson ( 2010 ) .",
    "the @xmath3 black hole mass function we have derived can be compared to the present day black hole mass function in order to determine the total black hole growth between @xmath218gyr after the big bang to today .",
    "locally , most black holes are inactive and measurement of their masses via dynamical tracers such as gas and stars have only been performed for about 50 of the closest galaxies ( gultekin et al .",
    "given the small scatter in scaling relations such as the @xmath219 and @xmath220 relations , it is common to derive the local black hole mass function by using the observed velocity dispersion function or luminosity function of galaxies in conjunction with scaling relations ( see tundo et al .",
    "2007 for a comparison of these methods ) .",
    "we use the range of plausible local black hole mass functions determined from analysis by shankar et al .",
    "( 2009 ) of several such studies ( plotted as a gray band in figure [ fig : mfz0z6 ] ) .",
    "the local and @xmath3 black hole mass functions shown in figure [ fig : mfz0z6 ] have rather similar shapes .",
    "the local function steepens above a somewhat lower mass of @xmath167 than the @xmath3 function .",
    "there is also some evidence for a steeper @xmath3 function at @xmath221 , although the @xmath3 function is not well constrained at the low mass end , due to few low - luminosity quasars and lack of @xmath61 measurements for them .",
    "the overall normalization of the @xmath3 black hole mass function is @xmath222 times that at @xmath5 , highlighting just how rare black holes are at this early epoch .    due to the existence of local scaling relations between black holes and galaxy properties and the implications for the importance of black holes in galaxy evolution , it is interesting to compare this evolution of the black hole mass function with the evolution of the mass which",
    "has formed into stars within galaxies .",
    "for the local stellar mass function we use the @xmath223 determination using the sdss new york university value - added galaxy catalog ( baldry et al .",
    "for the stellar mass function at @xmath3 we use that determined via star formation history sed fits to @xmath124 lyman break galaxies with deep _",
    "photometry by stark et al .",
    "these data start to become incomplete at @xmath224 and have a large uncertainty at @xmath225 due to the small volumes probed by these lyman break surveys .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mfz0z6 ] we plot the @xmath5 and @xmath3 stellar mass functions along with the black hole mass functions .",
    "the upper axis shows the stellar mass and it has been shifted horizontally by @xmath226 compared to the black hole mass axis .",
    "this factor is similar to the factors of @xmath227 ( haring & rix 2004 ) and @xmath226 ( tundo et al . 2007 ) determined from fits to the local @xmath228 relation and approximately matches the space densities of galaxies and black holes at @xmath5 in figure [ fig : mfz0z6 ] .",
    "figure [ fig : mfz0z6 ] shows the rather remarkable result that whereas the stellar mass density evolution from @xmath3 to @xmath5 is @xmath212 , the black hole mass density evolution over this same time period is @xmath4 , i.e. 100 times greater .",
    "this is observed to hold over about one order of magnitude in mass . at low black hole masses and high stellar masses",
    "the comparison is difficult because of the vastly different volume surveys undertaken for quasars and galaxies at @xmath3 . at @xmath225 , the very large uncertainty in stellar mass density",
    "makes it plausible that it matches that of black holes .",
    "larger area optical to mid - ir surveys for @xmath229 galaxies at @xmath124 are needed to address whether there is an exponential decline in the stellar mass function at this mass which would match the space density of @xmath230 black holes .",
    "we identify two possible reasons for this big difference between the mass accreted on to black holes and that which has formed stars by @xmath3 .",
    "eddington - limited accretion occurs exponentially so at early times when the black hole masses are small , there is a limit to how fast they can grow . in comparison , star formation has no similar restriction and in fact the high densities in the early universe may actually have enhanced the star formation rate ( e.g. granato et al . 2004 ) .",
    "another possibility is that only a fraction of galaxies were seeded with massive @xmath231 black holes .",
    "most theoretical attempts to account for the most massive black holes observed at @xmath3 have shown that seed black holes of this mass are required if accretion obeys the eddington limit ( yoo & miralda - escud 2004 ; li et al . 2007 ; sijacki et al .",
    "therefore the finding of a large discrepancy between the space densities of black holes and galaxies may be indicating that only a fraction of galaxies start with massive seeds .",
    "the less massive seeds in other galaxies will catch up by the peak in quasar activity at @xmath232 .",
    "this result is in contrast to observations of the evolution of the @xmath233 relation . in several studies",
    "it has been found that for agn - selected samples , the ratio of @xmath60 to @xmath234 evolves to higher values at higher redshift ( walter et al . 2004 ; peng et al .",
    "2006 ; mclure et al .",
    "2006 ; riechers et al . 2008 ; merloni et al .",
    "2010 ; wang et al .",
    "it is important to note that due to scatter in the @xmath60 to @xmath234 ( or @xmath235 ) relation combined with steep mass functions , luminous quasars will preferentially be found in lower mass hosts than would be expected based on the relation for a volume - limited sample of galaxies ( willott et al .",
    "2005 ; lauer et al .",
    "somerville ( 2009 ) and merloni et al . ( 2010 ) show that this bias could almost completely account for the observed evolution of the relation and that up to @xmath24 there is at most a factor of two of positive evolution in @xmath236 .",
    "other studies , selecting galaxies to be gas - rich starbursts without luminous agn ( borys et al .",
    "2005 ; alexander et al . 2008 ) , actually show negative evolution in @xmath237 highlighting how important selection effects are for distinct galaxy populations .",
    "note that our results are not necessarily in conflict with the molecular gas observations of @xmath119 quasars that show they have high ratios of @xmath60 to @xmath234 ( walter et al .",
    "2004 ; riechers et al . 2008 ; wang et al .",
    "the point is that there are many more galaxies with very low ratios of @xmath60 to @xmath234 which are not observed in quasar samples .",
    "attempts to study the theoretical global evolution in star formation versus black hole growth have been carried out by robertson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , hopkins et al .",
    "( 2006b ) and shankar et al .",
    "these show little evolution in the ratio , however they mostly do not go up to @xmath3 or are poorly constrained there .",
    "di matteo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) consider the evolution of the stellar mass density and black hole mass density in their simulations .",
    "they find that although there is little evolution from the local ratio up to @xmath24 , there is considerable evolution from @xmath24 to @xmath3 of nearly a factor of 10 ( in the sense that the black hole mass density declines more rapidly ) .",
    "their results are similar to ours , but with less rapid evolution , which can be explained because their simulations have a lower typical @xmath61 than we observe and therefore a higher black hole mass function .",
    "li et al . ( 2007 ) found in their simulations that the total stellar mass formed in the galaxies which would merge to become a @xmath3 sdss host galaxy led the total black hole mass by factors of 10 to 100 at early times ( @xmath238 ) .",
    "although not discussed in their paper , the likely reason for this behaviour is the eddington limit which restricts the very early growth of the black hole mass .",
    "lamastra et al .",
    "( 2010 ) use a semi - analytic cosmological model to predict positive evolution of @xmath236 by a factor of 3 for the global population up to @xmath239 which they explain as due to very efficient black hole growth at early times .",
    "their work suggests a ratio of black hole to stellar mass density @xmath240 times greater than we have found !",
    "our results hinge upon the assertions that the quasar duty cycle is very high at @xmath3 , there is little evolution in the fraction of obscured agn and therefore we have identified all the black holes as agn . the @xmath3 lyman break galaxies with stellar masses",
    "@xmath241 are about 100 times more common than low - luminosity quasars .",
    "it is possible that these galaxies contain inactive or obscured black holes and we have underestimated the true space density of black holes .",
    "we did account for a factor of 23 of obscured quasars , as observed at lower redshift , but perhaps this factor evolves dramatically at the highest redshifts due to the dusty nature of these young , forming host galaxies .",
    "mid - ir - selected agn samples do show an increase in the obscured fraction at @xmath242 ( m. lacy , priv .",
    "comm . ) . although there are observations requiring large dust masses in many @xmath119 quasar host galaxies ( wang et al .",
    "2008 ) , the lyman break - selected @xmath119 galaxies have very low dust extinction based on their uv spectral slopes ( bouwens et al .",
    "2009 ) .    at @xmath243 ,",
    "about 35% of lyman break galaxies contain evidence for weak agn ( steidel et al .",
    "2002 ; reddy et al .",
    "spectra of @xmath3 galaxies show a high incidence of narrow ly@xmath39  emission lines ( stanway et al . 2007 ;",
    "ouchi et a. 2008 ) , but most higher ionization metal lines which could be used to test for agn lie in the near - ir .",
    "the nirspec instrument on the _ james webb space telescope _ will be able to detect weak high ionization lines and/or weak broad balmer lines in these galaxies to determine if they do host hidden agn .",
    "another potential method of searching for obscured agn activity is mid - ir imaging of the hot dust with the miri instrument .",
    "we have presented new near - ir spectroscopy for nine of the most distant known , moderate luminosity quasars .",
    "these data have been used to estimate virial black hole masses based on the mgii  linewidth and uv luminosity . adding",
    "in published data on more luminous quasars we obtain a sample of 17 quasars at @xmath244 . our results and conclusions can be summarized as follows .",
    "* we observe a positive correlation between the mgii  line fwhm and uv continuum luminosity . such a correlation is usually absent from lower redshift samples due to the broad range of eddington ratios at lower redshift ( fine et al .",
    "2008 ; shen et al .",
    "the existence of this correlation at high - redshift provides support for the validity of the virial linewidth estimator .",
    "* there is a linear correlation between black hole mass and uv continuum luminosity and the quasars are accreting close to the eddington limit .",
    "the distribution of _ observed _ eddington ratios is a lognormal centred on @xmath149 with dispersion 0.28 dex .",
    "this distribution is significantly different from that of a luminosity - matched @xmath24 sample which has a distribution centred on @xmath151 with a broader dispersion of 0.39 dex .",
    "accounting for selection effects due to the quasar sample magnitude limits , we determine the _ intrinsic _ eddington ratio distribution for a volume - limited sample of black holes at @xmath3 . this distribution is a lognormal centred on @xmath158 with dispersion 0.30 dex .",
    "the eddington ratio distribution we find at @xmath3 is consistent with the results of simulations of high - density peaks in the early dark matter distribution ( li et al .",
    "2007 ; sijacki et a. 2009 ) . *",
    "the implication of these results is that at @xmath3 all the quasars we are observing are still in their initial exponential growth phases due to their young host galaxies and a plentiful gas supply . combining the eddington ratio distribution with the assumption of a high duty cycle and the observed quasar luminosity function of willott et al .",
    "( 2010 ) we can derive the black hole mass function . note that this is a much harder problem at low redshifts where the eddington ratio distribution is broader and the duty cycle is unknown .",
    "the resulting black hole mass function is factors of @xmath202 to @xmath203 below previous estimates ( shankar et al .",
    "2009 ) due to a lower luminosity function normalization , accretion radiative efficiency , duty cycle and higher eddington ratios . * the evolution in the black hole mass function from @xmath3 to @xmath5 is a factor of @xmath245 .",
    "this is much greater than the @xmath246 increase in the stellar mass function over the same redshift interval .",
    "this means that the stars in galaxies were formed much more rapidly at high redshift than black holes grew , presumably due either to the limited rate at which black holes can grow due to radiation pressure or that only a small fraction of galaxies had massive initial black hole seeds .",

    "four cfhqs quasars were observed with the niri spectrograph and did not yield measurements of the mgii  emission line width . in all but one case , this was due to insufficient s / n for these very faint targets . in the other case",
    "it is because the quasar does not have broad emission lines .",
    "therefore black hole masses could not be determined . here",
    "we show the spectra and discuss why mgii  lines could not be measured and what constraints exist on the broad line widths in these quasars .",
    "none of these quasars are likely to have broad lines significantly broader than the quasars in section [ nirspec ] and therefore the exclusion of these four quasars does not significantly bias the results and analysis presented in this paper .",
    "the optical spectrum of this quasar is very unusual because it shows an extremely weak ly@xmath39  line at @xmath247 ( willott et al .",
    "unpublished higher resolution spectroscopy confirms the absence of significant ly@xmath39  emission , but does show a sharp continuum break at a ly@xmath39  redshift of @xmath248 and intervening metal absorption at redshifts up to @xmath249 confirming the high - redshift nature of this quasar .",
    "the near - ir spectrum has relatively high continuum s / n in the range @xmath250 at the expected mgii  wavelength .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : badnirispec ] there is absolutely no sign of an mgii  line in this quasar , so the lack of ly@xmath39  is not just due to dust or igm absorption , but a lack of broad emission lines such as the quasars investigated by diamond - stanic et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "this quasar is the faintest @xmath119 quasar known by some margin with an absolute magnitude @xmath188 and could be considered a seyfert galaxy rather than quasar based on luminosity ( willott et al .",
    "2009 ) . due to its faintness in the near - ir ( @xmath251 ) we did not expect high s / n continuum in the niri spectrum (",
    "which was only composed of 1.75 hours of good weather data ) .",
    "the only reason that we targeted this extremely faint quasar was because the ly@xmath39  line is very strong and if the mgii  line were comparably strong , it could have been possible to measure it in @xmath252 hours on - source .",
    "neither continuum nor a mgii  line could be seen in the 1.75 hours niri spectrum and therefore no spectrum was extracted .",
    "we note that the ly@xmath39  line is very narrow with fwhm of @xmath194 ( after correcting for absorption of the blue wing ) which implies it has a very high accretion rate , close to the eddington limit .",
    "the quasar has @xmath253 based on the ly@xmath39  line position ( willott et al .",
    "it is quite faint ( @xmath254 ) and the continuum s / n per pixel in the 2.6 hour long niri integration is only @xmath210 . as shown in figure [ fig : badnirispec ]",
    "the mgii  emission line is detected , but at this redshift , some parts of the line co - incide with the noisiest regions of our spectra due to a combination of a strong sky line and atmospheric absorption .",
    "this prevents a reliable measurement of either the line center or the fwhm .",
    "the mgii  line appears fairly narrow and the best fit has @xmath253 and fwhm=@xmath255 .",
    "however , we do not include it in our analysis because the fwhm is very uncertain .",
    "this is another very faint quasar ( @xmath256 ) with a ly@xmath39  line at @xmath257 ( willott et al .",
    "the 3.9 hours niri spectrum shows several peaks around the expected mgii  wavelength ( figure [ fig : badnirispec ] ) . due to the low s / n it is difficult to constrain the fwhm .",
    "the best fit line is at @xmath258 and has fwhm=@xmath259 .",
    "note that the best fit has a very steep , blue continuum which , if extrapolated , is not consistent with the known @xmath37 and @xmath38 magnitudes ."
