    "in this paper , we continue our study of the simplest gross - neveu ( gn ) model @xcite , a 1 + 1 dimensional model field theory of @xmath1 species of massless , self - interacting dirac fermions with lagrangian @xmath2 we restrict ourselves from the outset to the t  hooft limit @xmath3 const .",
    "semiclassical methods have revealed a number of fascinating properties of this model over the years , see the review articles @xcite and references therein .",
    "a key quantity in these studies is the scalar mean field @xmath4 .",
    "it plays a role similar to witten s  master field \" in large @xmath1 gauge theories @xcite , namely as saddle point of the functional integral from which all observables can be computed . for fermions in the large @xmath1 limit",
    ", it can be identified with the self - consistent hartree - fock ( hf ) potential .",
    "most of the results for @xmath4 obtained so far are related to static problems . in the vacuum ,",
    "the hf potential is homogeneous and can be interpreted as dynamical fermion mass @xcite .",
    "localized , spatially varying hf potentials describe individual baryons @xcite .",
    "spatially periodic solutions appear in investigations of baryonic matter , both at zero @xcite and finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the most difficult problem is to find solutions of the time - dependent hartree - fock approach ( tdhf ) , at least non - trivial solutions which are not simply boosted , static solutions .",
    "the only known analytical solutions of this type to date are the breather @xcite and kink - antikink scattering @xcite .",
    "since both are related by analytical continuation , there is in fact only one non - trivial time - dependent solution known .",
    "this reflects the lack of systematic methods to derive time - dependent , self - consistent mean fields for fermions .",
    "recently , it was pointed out that the situation is more favorable for a class of particularly simple tdhf solutions , classified as  type i \" in @xcite .",
    "they are defined as those solutions where the scalar density of each single particle level is proportional to the full self - consistent potential @xmath4 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 may vanish for some states .",
    "if property ( [ a3 ] ) is satisfied , the tdhf problem reduces to the classical @xmath7 gn model , for which neveu and papanicolaou have uncovered a relationship with the sinh - gordon equation some time ago @xcite . as a consequence , the self - consistent tdhf potential of the gn model ( [ a1 ] ) can be shown to satisfy the classical sinh - gordon equation @xcite .",
    "this is surprising at first sight , as the sinh - gordon equation possesses only singular solitons .",
    "owing to a non - linear field transformation however , these singularities are mapped onto zeros of @xmath4 , @xmath8 so that the scalar mean field @xmath4 is perfectly regular .",
    "one can easily check that the mean fields for the kink baryon @xcite , kink - antikink scattering @xcite and the kink crystal , the ground state of the gn model at finite density @xcite , are indeed all related to known soliton solutions of the sinh - gordon equation .",
    "this raises immediately the question : are there other soliton solutions of the sinh - gordon equation which might yield physically sensible , new tdhf solutions of the gn model ?",
    "if one thinks about this problem , one encounters two potential obstacles .",
    "the first has to do with the singularities of all sinh - gordon solitons , the second with the fact that the sinh - gordon equation is a necessary condition for type i solutions , but perhaps not sufficient .",
    "the first difficulty can be handled as follows .",
    "if one inspects the available solutions of the sinh - gordon equation in the literature , one finds in all cases that the argument of the logarithm in eq .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) has either zeros , or poles , or both .",
    "this reflects the fact that all solitons are singular . in order to get a bounded @xmath4",
    ", we should only allow for zeros .",
    "as already pointed out in @xcite , the most interesting solution of this type is presumably the @xmath0 soliton solution constructed by the inverse scattering method @xcite ( throughout this paper we use @xmath1 to denote the number of flavors and @xmath0 to denote the number of baryons , to avoid confusion ) . in the gn model",
    "the @xmath0 soliton solution is expected to describe time dependent scattering of @xmath0 kink- and antikink - baryons .",
    "the second difficulty simply means that solutions of the sinh - gordon equation should only be taken as candidates for tdhf potentials in the gn model .",
    "given any such solution , one still has to solve the dirac equation for all continuum states in the dirac sea and the valence bound states and verify self - consistency of the mean field .",
    "in this paper , we propose to do just this for the @xmath0 soliton solution .",
    "our main goal is to find the most general type i solution of the tdhf equations for the gn model . from the particle physics point of view , one is rarely interested in scattering problems involving more than two incident particles .",
    "a time - dependent @xmath0 soliton solution on the other hand describes a scattering process involving @xmath0 incident and @xmath0 outgoing objects . as a purely theoretical problem",
    ", we find it nevertheless challenging to solve the dynamics of @xmath0 composite , relativistic bound states at the elementary fermion level , in full generality .",
    "our motivation is not primarily particle physics phenomenology , but the desire to find new exact , analytical solutions of a relevant model quantum field theory .    finally , let us try to relate our work to another important property of the gn model , integrability .",
    "as is well known , the gn model ( [ a1 ] ) is an example of an integrable quantum field theory for any value of @xmath1 .",
    "the exact @xmath4 matrix , including kinks and antikinks , has been constructed some time ago @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we find it worthwhile to attack this problem with entirely different methods in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "first of all , the @xmath4 matrix for the finite @xmath1 gn model is only known in principle .",
    "the examples worked out in the original references deal with low values of @xmath1 ( 2 - 8 majorana flavors , corresponding to 1 - 4 dirac flavors ) and few particles only .",
    "since the algebraic complexity rapidly increases with increasing number of flavors and participants , it is not easy to infer the large @xmath1 limit of the collision of @xmath0 bound states from the published @xmath4 matrix .",
    "secondly , the full dynamical tdhf solution has more information than the @xmath4 matrix which encodes only asymptotic , on - shell scattering information . finally , although integrability certainly helps to find the tdhf solution , it is apparently not a prerequisite .",
    "thus for instance , although the massive version of the gn model is not integrable , hf solutions have been found for baryons @xcite and baryonic crystals @xcite in closed analytical form .",
    "for all of these reasons we have decided to make a dedicated effort to solve the @xmath0 kink - antikink scattering problem in the large @xmath1 limit of the gn model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we give a rather detailed introduction into the single kink baryon in an arbitrary lorentz frame and set up our notation in light - cone coordinates . sec .",
    "iii briefly recalls the @xmath0 soliton solution of the sinh - gordon equation . in sec .",
    "iv we describe how we get to the tdhf spinors and prove self - consistency .",
    "v is needed to put the formal results into a form better suited for practical applications , which then follow in sec .",
    "we characterize the general @xmath0 baryon scattering process qualitatively and exhibit a few illustrative examples involving dynamics of up to eight solitons .",
    "we end with a concluding section .",
    "the kink baryon of the gn model , originally discovered by callen , coleman , gross and zee ( cited in @xcite ) , is at the same time the simplest and the most exotic baryon .",
    "its properties are well studied @xcite .",
    "we review it here because of its role as main actor in the dynamical @xmath0 baryon problem addressed in this work .",
    "an important aspect in which we differ from all previous works except @xcite is the fact that we consider the kink in an arbitrary lorentz frame , not just its rest frame .",
    "this is of course a prerequisite for treating scattering processes .",
    "the outline of this chapter is the following : we will introduce light - cone coordinates and present first the vacuum and then the boosted kink in the tdhf approach .",
    "the scalar hf potential @xmath4 and the self - consistency issue will be addressed .",
    "we then compute expectation values of other relevant fermion bilinears , namely the density @xmath9 , the pseudoscalar density @xmath10 and the axial charge density @xmath11 , resolving contributions from the dirac sea and the bound state .",
    "next we briefly recall the derivation of the sinh - gordon equation from ref .",
    "@xcite for type i tdhf solutions , of which the kink is a paradigm .",
    "finally we summarize the essential physics properties of the kink .",
    "this section presents no new results , but serves to introduce light - cone coordinates and set up the notation to be used in later chapters for the @xmath0 baryon problem .",
    "starting point is the tdhf equation of the gn model , expected to become exact in the large @xmath1 limit , @xmath12 the sum over occupied states runs over the whole dirac sea as well as possible valence states and includes flavor degrees of freedom . a non - vanishing scalar mean field @xmath4 signals breakdown of the z@xmath13 chiral symmetry @xmath14 .",
    "we choose a chiral basis for the dirac matrices , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is diagonal . in conjunction with light cone",
    "coordinates @xmath17 this simplifies the dirac equation in ( [ c1 ] ) to @xmath18 in terms of upper , left - handed ( @xmath19 ) and lower , right - handed ( @xmath20 ) spinor components .",
    "consider first the vacuum problem where @xmath21 is the dynamical fermion mass in natural units . here",
    ", the tdhf equation reduces to the free , massive dirac equation with solutions @xmath22 labeled by a spectral parameter @xmath23 .",
    "this parameter contains the information on momentum @xmath24 and energy @xmath25 via @xmath26 a relation which allows us to cast the plane wave factor in ( [ c4 ] ) into the standard form @xmath27 ( if @xmath28 is interpreted as light cone time , then @xmath23 is the light cone energy , but we shall not use this language in the following . ) the gap equation arises from the self - consistency equation for the scalar condensate in the vacuum .",
    "the continuum spinor @xmath29 yields the scalar density @xmath30 the ( cutoff regularized ) summation over the dirac sea can be performed conveniently after the following change of integration variables , @xmath31 the resulting gap equation , @xmath32 yields the relation between bare coupling and cutoff characteristic for dimensional transmutation .",
    "we now turn to the simplest baryon solution of eqs .",
    "( [ c1 ] ) , the kink or antikink . without loss of generality",
    ", we consider the antikink moving with velocity @xmath33 . in ordinary",

    "the tdhf spinors for the antikink can easily be found . in lightcone notation , the continuum states read @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath42 differ only by a constant , complex phase , @xmath46 as is well known , the potential @xmath4 is reflectionless , a crucial property for everything we shall do in this work .",
    "the kink at rest possesses one normalizable zero energy bound state , in agreement with the expectation based on its topological properties .",
    "the corresponding boosted bound state can be obtained from the continuum spinor by setting @xmath47 ( i.e. , analytic continuation to imaginary spectral parameter ) and normalizing , @xmath48    the scalar densities for continuum and bound states , @xmath49 show that we are dealing with a type i solution according to the classification of ref  @xcite  every occupied state yields a contribution to the scalar condensate proportional to the full hf potential @xmath4 .",
    "the self - consistency condition simply reduces to the vacuum gap equation ( [ c9 ] ) , @xmath50    consider the expectation value of the fermion density in the kink next .",
    "it consists of two contributions , one from the continuum states ( the dirac sea ) and one from the bound state .",
    "an individual continuum state @xmath29 gives the following ( vacuum subtracted ) contribution to the density @xmath51 performing the @xmath52-integration and multiplying by the number of flavors ( each state is fully occupied ) , we find the continuum fermion density @xmath53 and hence the following contribution from the dirac sea to the total fermion number , @xmath54 this result can be understood heuristically as follows : the midgap state receives one half of its strength from the negative , the other half from the positive energy continuum .",
    "this half missing state in the dirac sea manifests itself in the peculiar value of the induced fermion number ( [ c21 ] ) .",
    "this effect has been discussed extensively in the context of fractional fermion number and gives rise to observable consequences in condensed matter systems , such as unusual spin - charge assignments in solitonic excitations of polymers @xcite .",
    "next we turn to the contribution to the fermion density from the bound state , assuming that the valence level is filled with @xmath55 fermions .",
    "the bound state fermion density is @xmath56 normalized to the number of fermions in the valence state , @xmath57 the continuum and bound state densities ( [ c20 ] ) and ( [ c22 ] ) are proportional to each other , so that the total fermion density becomes @xmath58 the total fermion number @xmath59 of the kink lies between @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in particular , if the bound state is half filled , the density vanishes identically .",
    "we are then dealing with a time - dependent excitation of the scalar condensate , a pure  domain wall \" moving with constant velocity @xmath33 .",
    "if the bound state is fully occupied or empty , the kink carries @xmath62 fermions and may be thought of somewhat loosely as half a baryon or antibaryon .    for the sake of completeness ,",
    "let us also evaluate the pseudoscalar condensate along similar lines , once again assuming @xmath63 valence fermions , @xmath64 this quantity is finite and vanishes in the vacuum , so that no subtraction is needed .",
    "finally , the last independent bilinear is the axial density ( or vector current ) @xmath65 , where we must once again subtract the vacuum contribution , @xmath66    notice that in all 3 cases ( [ c24],[c25],[c26 ] ) , the sum over continuum states is proportional to the contribution from the bound state , with identical relative weights ( discrete and continuum parts can be identified via the factors @xmath63 and @xmath1 , respectively ) .",
    "this fact can be understood with the help of the divergence of vector and axial vector currents @xcite , @xmath67 invoking large @xmath1 factorization and using @xmath68 characteristic for 1 + 1 dimensions , we get @xmath69 showing that the three bilinears @xmath70 are linearly related . as a test of the above calculations , one can verify that the kink results for the bilinears do satisfy eqs .",
    "( [ c29 ] ) .",
    "the evaluation of mass , energy and momentum of the kink baryon is delicate due to vacuum subtraction and subtleties in the counting of modes .",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite where it was shown in detail that the tdhf approach gives a covariant energy - momentum relation for the baryon in the gn model , @xmath71 ( in natural units ) .",
    "the mass of the kink is independent of the number of fermions carried by it , since the bound state has zero energy in the rest frame and vanishing chiral condensate .",
    "so far , we have only dealt with the dirac equation involving @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the other two derivatives , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , can also be expressed linearly in @xmath76 with coefficients depending on @xmath4 and its first derivatives .",
    "the result , valid for type i solutions if @xmath4 approaches a vacuum value @xmath77 for @xmath78 , is a kind of  extended dirac equation \" @xmath79 with @xmath80 the integrability condition of the system ( [ c31 ] ) , @xmath81 = 0 , \\label{c33}\\ ] ] yields the sinh - gordon equation for @xmath82 , @xmath83 or , in normal coordinates , @xmath84 the linearized form of this last equation is the klein - gordon equation for a scalar field with mass 2 which may be identified with the well - known @xmath85 meson of the gn model .",
    "hence the kink can be thought of as a large amplitude excitation of the @xmath85 field , thereby extending the skyrme picture to the case of a discrete chiral symmetry . finally , it is easy to check that eqs .",

    "the fermion density vanishes identically for a half filled valence level .",
    "4 .   shape , mass and motion of the kink are independent of the number of fermions it carries  in this sense , there is no backreaction of the fermions .",
    "we should like to point out that in spite of the solvability of the model and the peculiar properties of the kink , we are dealing with a relativistic , composite object with an interesting internal structure reminiscent of hadrons . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the structure function , derived analytically from the fermion momentum distribution in the infinite momentum frame , was shown to display non - trivial contributions from  valence quarks \" ,  sea quarks \" and  antiquarks \" , with a slight abuse of language .",
    "it is therefore a non - trivial question to ask how such composite , relativistic objects interact with each other .",
    "as discussed above , the kink of the gn model is akin to the one - soliton solution of the sinh - gordon equation .",

    "[ fig1 ] for the case of @xmath225 solitons , in a frame where all velocities @xmath161 are positive .",
    "since a kink and an antikink can not pass through each other , it looks as if the solitons repel and stay in the same order .",

    "[ fig1 ] , the fermions move roughly along the straight lines ( ignoring interaction effects ) .",

    "nevertheless we would be dealing with a valid solution of a quantum field theory .",
    "this underlines the non - perturbative character of the whole approach .",
    "let us now consider some further illustrative examples .",
    "our original motivation for studying the gn model came form strong interaction physics . in real life",
    ", natural many - baryon problems would involve nuclei .",
    "if the 2-soliton scattering is taken as a toy model for nucleon - nucleon scattering , one would like to address next nucleon - nucleus or nucleus - nucleus collisions at the elementary fermion level .",
    "unfortunately , the gn model has no  nuclei \" , i.e. , bound states of baryons .",
    "the baryon - baryon interaction is repulsive .",
    " nuclear matter \" exists in the form of a soliton crystal , but it is neither self - bound , nor does it saturate .",
    "scattering problems with more than two incident particles on the other hand have no obvious analogue in particle physics .",
    "therefore , the best we can do to mock up nuclear targets or projectiles in our toy world is to use  trains \" of solitons with nearly equal velocities .",
    "although unstable , such a configuration will stay together for a time long enough to study scattering processes .",
    "these trains of solitons may be thought of as chunks of soliton crystals (  nuclear matter \" ) . in applications of the present model to other fields like condensed matter physics , the interest would presumably be in a different kind of @xmath0-soliton problem . the formulae given in sec .",
    "[ sect5 ] should enable the reader to produce easily any desired result by choosing appropriate parameters .",
    "proceeding in this spirit , we show in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] an example of the analogue of a baryon - nucleus collision for 1 + 5 solitons , in the ( approximate ) rest frame of the target  nucleus \" .",
    "the kinks behave much like classical hard spheres , i.e. , the incoming projectile gets stopped when it hits the first target baryon , and the last target baryon leaves , carrying away the momentum .",
    "this can be inferred from the scalar potential in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . to illustrate the fate of the fermions , we fully load the projectile and target baryons with @xmath226 fermions each . as shown in fig .",

    "this is the closest we can come to simulate a ",
    "relativistic nucleus - nucleus collision \" in the gn model . figs .",

    "[ fig6 ] for the scalar potential and fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] for the density , one may be tempted to conclude that both figures show multi - soliton collisions .",
    "indeed , in both cases all the lumps emerge unchanged from the collision process .",
    "however this interpretation is only valid for @xmath4 and the underlying sinh - gordon equation .",
    "that the density has no solitonic character already follows from the fact that the normalization of each fermion cluster can be arbitrarily chosen .",
    "formally , whereas @xmath4 is the solution of a non - linear differential equation , the density can be thought to arise from a linear equation where @xmath4 enters as an external field , similar to the spinors in the tdhf equation . in any case",
    ", the fact that our solitons carry fermions is an interesting aspect not shared by standard applications of solitons in physics , but reminiscent of early soliton bag models @xcite in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the observation that solitons share some properties with elementary particles is as old as soliton theory . in the gn model",
    ", this relationship can now be made very precise .",
    "the underlying quantum field theory is purely fermionic .",
    "it produces dynamically multi - fermion bound states . in the large @xmath1 limit ,",
    "the appropriate semiclassical setting is the relativistic hf approach .",
    "the scalar hf potential is a classical field with solitonic character , but the bound fermions are also relevant for understanding the structure of  hadrons \" .",
    "this is of course well known since long time already .",
    "the new insight which we can add now is the fact that for a certain class of particularly simple solutions ( called type i ) , the whole dynamics can be decoupled from the fermions and cast into the form of a non - linear differential equation for the scalar mean field .",
    "this equation turns out to be the sinh - gordon equation .",
    "apparently one can bypass the complicated self - consistency issue for these particular solutions and arrive at the self - consistent solution by just solving a single , nonlinear differential equation for the  master field \" @xmath4 .",
    "the fermions then follow the motion of the solitons , but do not react back in any way . since the relevant soliton equation is well known , this enabled us to solve a rather involved problem in closed analytical form , namely the dynamics of @xmath0 kink and antikink baryons with arbitrary fermion number , initial positions and velocities .",
    "we have analyzed this type of scattering process and found that it has many unrealistic features from the point of view of particle physics .",
    "however , here we have no choice since we are not dealing with a phenomenological model , but the solution of a given quantum field theory , eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) , in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "actually , examples in theoretical physics where the dynamics of a number of composite particles can be analyzed exactly at the elementary constituent level are extremely rare , even in non - relativistic many - body physics . in our case , lorentz covariance is strictly maintained and the polarization of the dirac sea fully taken into account .",
    "the methods developed here in a concrete example may have some potential for generalizations .",
    "one striking observation is the fact that the tdhf spinors are apparently closely related to auxiliary spinors introduced in soliton theory when one looks for solutions via the inverse scattering method .",
    "it is very likely that there is a more general principle behind this apparent coincidence .",
    "it was certainly important that we restricted ourselves to type i solutions of the tdhf equations .",
    "all other analytically known solutions of the massless or massive gn model are actually type ii and therefore related to the @xmath228 classical gn model",
    ". it would be interesting to generalize our approach to this more general case , thereby extending the pool of exact solutions , perhaps even to non - integrable field theories like the massive gn model .",
