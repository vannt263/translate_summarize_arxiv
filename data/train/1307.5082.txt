    "the bulk photovoltaic effect consists in the occurrence of a photocurrent and very large photovoltages when illuminating homogeneous crystals having no inversion symmetry .",
    "@xcite the idea of the practical application of this effect in ferroelectrics for solar energy conversion was discussed back in the 70s .",
    "@xcite however , because of the short lifetime of photo - excited carriers , the quantum yield of this effect is generally small , and the idea was decided to be unproductive . in recent years",
    ", the interest to the ferroelectric oxides with the perovskite structure has revived because new ideas how to increase the efficiency of solar energy converters based on the bulk photovoltaic effect have been proposed .",
    "@xcite the main disadvantage of the ferroelectric oxides is their relatively large band gap , causing them to absorb only a small fraction of the solar radiation .",
    "recent theoretical studies have shown that the substitution of ti atoms at the @xmath5  sites of the perovskite structure with divalent impurities having the @xmath6 electron configuration ( ni , pd , pt ) , compensated by the oxygen vacancy , decreases the band gap and the obtained perovskites are polar semiconductor oxides .",

    "@xcite    in addition , the search for new magnetic off - center impurities in incipient ferroelectrics is still important because they can result in simultaneous emergence of the ferroelectricity and magnetic ordering and give rise to the magnetoelectric interaction .",

    "srtio@xmath2 doped with mn at the @xmath7 site is an example of such a material , in which a new type of magnetoelectric interaction was recently discovered .",
    "@xcite ni - doped samples could be an another example .",
    "since the doping impurity can enter several different sites in the perovskite structure and stay in them in different oxidation states , the aim of this work was to study the structural position and the oxidation state of the ni impurity in srtio@xmath2 prepared under different conditions using xafs spectroscopy .",
    "we planned to check the possibility of preparing samples doped with divalent ni at the @xmath5  site , to evaluate the possibility of incorporating the ni impurity into the @xmath7  site , and to establish a correlation between the optical properties of the samples , on the one hand , and the structural position and the oxidation state of the ni impurity , on the other hand .",
    "the choice of srtio@xmath2 was dictated by the fact that earlier we have studied the structural position and the oxidation state of a number of @xmath8 elements in srtio@xmath2 ( mn ,  @xcite co ,  @xcite fe  @xcite ) , and their combined analysis can allow to find new promising impurities for solar energy converters .",

    "this explanation , however , contradicts the fact that our exafs data analysis revealed no distortion of the oxygen octahedra , whereas the localization of a hole at one or two oxygen ions should cause its distortion .    at the same time",
    ", the experimental study of xanes spectra of li@xmath1nio@xmath9 compound used in lithium batteries have shown that a variation in the degree of intercalation @xmath49 changes the ni oxidation state from 2 + to 4 + and shifts the absorption edge in xanes spectra by @xmath443.5  ev .",

    "there are two possible explanation of this fact .",
    "first , it can be an evidence for the existence of a small amount of ni@xmath50-@xmath54 complexes .",
    "the coordination number for these complexes is effectively reduced to 4 because one of the oxygen atoms is missing and the other one is located at a different distance compared to four remaining o atoms and does not contribute much to the exafs signal .",
    "this explanation agrees with the reduced shift of the absorption edge in our sample with respect to the ni@xmath52 state in li@xmath1nio@xmath9 .",
    "another explanation is the existence of a small amount of the nitio@xmath2 phase located at the grain boundaries ; the experiment shows that the contamination with this phase strongly decreases the coordination number because of out - of - phase exafs oscillations in two nickel - containing phases .",
    "neverthless , we think that the oxidation state of ni at the @xmath5  site in srtio@xmath2 is close to 4 + ; this disagrees with the suggestion made earlier  @xcite that ni is in the 2 + oxidation state in the related ferroelectric pbtio@xmath2 .",
    "although the question about the actual oxidation state of ni in the latter material should be tested experimentally , our findings indicate that the strong light absorption in ni - doped srtio@xmath2 is associated with the tetravalent nickel .    from the viewpoint of possible application of doped perovskites in solar energy conversion it is interesting to compare the properties of srtio@xmath2 doped with nickel and with other @xmath8 elements .",
    "@xcite the absorption spectra of doped samples are systematically shifted to the infrared region with increasing atomic number from mn to ni : manganese - doped samples are greenish brown , iron - doped samples are brown , cobalt - doped samples are dark brown , and ni gives an almost black color to the samples .",
    "thus , for creating samples that strongly absorb light in the whole visible region , the nickel doping seems the most promising .",

    "interestingly , the small value of the debye - waller factor for the first shell ( @xmath550.0035  @xmath16 ) also excludes the possibility of jahn - teller instability of the ni@xmath52 ion in srtio@xmath2 , which is possible for the octahedral @xmath56 configuration . in li@xmath1nio@xmath9 ,",

    "moreover , even the color of the samples is different ( beige in ref .   and almost black in our work ) .",
    "we believe that these differences in the properties of the samples result from the different methods of their preparation ( solid - state reaction method in our case and hydrothermal synthesis at 150@xmath11c in ref .  ) . in ref .  , single crystals of srtio@xmath2(ni ) were investigated by electron spin resonance . in these works ,",
    "the esr spectra associated with axial ni@xmath50-@xmath54 complexes were systematically observed along with the esr spectra which were attributed to the `` cubic '' ni@xmath47 and ni@xmath50 centers .",
