    "during past decades , a large number of extremely metal - poor ( emp ) stars with the metallicity well below the lowest metallicity of globular clusters ( @xmath5 ) have been discovered in the galactic halo thanks to large - scaled hk and he s surveys @xcite .",
    "these stars should have been born out of gas polluted by the ejecta of the first and subsequent supernovae and survive to date because of low - masses ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "their surface abundances , unveiled by high - dispersion spectroscopic observations , may carry imprints of the nucleosynthesis and metal - enrichment process during the formation of the galactic halo and serve as a probe into the structure formation in the early universe .",
    "the stellar abundances for galactic archaeology ( saga ) database ( http://saga.sci.hokudai.ac.jp/ ) assembles the abundance data and other stellar parameters , aiming at covering all the papers dealing with stars of @xmath7 , published since 2000 and some traced back to 1994 ( * ? ? ?",

    "it enables to explore the attributes of emp and metal - poor stars through the statistical analyses of a large sample of stars , observed to date . in paper",
    "ii , we discuss the overall characteristics of abundance peculiarities of emp stars related to the internal and external elemental pollution including the carbon enhancement . in this paper , we investigate detailed histories of chemical enrichment for elements as many as possible by using the abundances and other stellar parameters , to reveal the nucleosynthetic processes and sites in the early stage of the galaxy formation .",
    "the enrichment histories of elements are connected to the star formation rate ( sfr ) and the initial mass function ( imf ) , coupled with the mass and metallicity dependences of the lifetimes and nucleosynthetic yields of supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "the sfr may influence the element enrichment through the difference in the lifetimes of progenitors to sne .",
    "the core - collapsed sne ( ccsne ) enrich the interstellar medium with most of metals as well as iron in timescales of @xmath8 myr or so , while type ia sne dominantly eject iron in much longer timescales typically of @xmath9 gyr .",
    "accordingly , type ia sne lag behind ccsne and may bring about a decrease in the abundance ratio of metals to iron ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is reported that stars exhibit decrease in the abundance ratios of @xmath0-elements to iron around @xmath10 for dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is interpreted to mean that these systems achieve the metal - enrichments after type ia sne have contributed to the chemical evolution .",
    "the time lag of type ia sne behind ccsne may introduce the timescale to the metal - enrichment histories , as well known .",
    "as for the imf of emp stars , constraint is discussed from the statistics of carbon enhanced stars in the galactic halo @xcite , based on the binary scenario for their origin ( * ? ? ?",

    "furthermore , the same conclusion is derived from the scarcity of emp stars , detected by hk and he s surveys @xcite .",
    "if the high - mass imf is the case for emp stars , there should be transition to low - mass imf such as observed for stars of younger populations during the galaxy halo formation ( see paper ii ) .",
    "the imf change should have left imprints of nucleosynthetic signatures on the surface abundances that stem from the dependence of sn yields on the progenitor mass .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is claimed as indicative that the imf is not invariant in time @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite discuss a decrease of @xmath12 between @xmath13 and @xmath14 , while others deem it nearly constant ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite detect two distinct groups with different @xmath12 among the halo stars of @xmath15 , whereas @xcite argue the spread of abundances only for mg .",

    "discontinuous change in @xmath16 around @xmath17 is pointed out @xcite .",
    "the understanding of element enrichments is yet to be properly established , in particular with relation to sfr and imf .",
    "more extensive and systematic studies are necessary to draw a consistent picture on the chemical enrichment histories .",
    "the previous studies are prone to suffer from small number statistics , which prevents from deriving reliable results .",

    "a salient feature of the @xmath1 break is that the differences of @xmath23 agree with each other within errors for all the elements studied .",
    "it is readily to be interpreted , therefore , in terms of the increase of iron production rather than decreases in the production of all other elements .",
    "such a surplus of iron yield over the other elements is provided by type ia sne that explode with the evolutionary time much longer time than ccsne .",
    "if this is the case , pop  iic stars has to raise the metallicity up to @xmath1 by ccsne before the delayed iron production by type ia sne comes to be dominant .",
    "this condition places a constraint on the average star formation rate ( sfr ) of pop  iic stars ; @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the delay time for type ia sne to dominate over the iron production : @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the average iron yield of ccsne and their number per unit mass incorporated into the stars at the formation .",

    "it is in contrast to the contributions of type ia sne in more metal - rich regime of @xmath95 ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in some of dwarf galaxies @xcite , which reduce @xmath96 by several tenth dex down to the solar value or even below .",
    "this indicates either that the star formation of pop  iid is interrupted on the way of decreasing @xmath93 , or contrariwise that the specific sfr is sufficiently elevated . in the latter case ,",
    "the yields of ccsne overwhelm those from type ia sne again to cease the decrease of @xmath93 or even switch to an upturn .",
    "in actuality , the thick disk is ascribed to the star burst , which are aged @xmath97 gyr and raise the average metallicity up to @xmath98 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) ; the specific sfr is estimated to be larger by an order of magnitude @xmath99 in the same way as above but with the metallicity , @xmath100 at which the iron - production by type ia sne becomes important .",
    "it is likely that the star forming region of pop  iid is involved by such star bursts and/or affected by the yields produced by the latter ccsne .",

    "the spectroscopic observations of these two groups of stars are usually performed separately , so that their relative numbers may be subject to the selection bias of observed targets . and",

    "this is broadly consistent with the results by @xcite , who derive the global trend of cemp star fraction increasing with @xmath54 for the sample stars of sloan digital sky survey .",
    "the results indicates larger fraction of cemp stars for pop  iib than for pop  iic at the same metallicity range , which is explicable in terms of the change of imf from a high - mass to low - mass one @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the imf of pop  iib has to be both high - mass and top - heavy from large low - mass cut - off and large fraction of more massive ccsne , while for pop  iic , the small fraction of cemp stars and the contribution of type ia sne indicate a low - mass imf .",

    "these two sites are expected to bring about the star formation under different conditions . in the former case ,",
    "the star formation occurs under the self - gravity of gas , little influenced by the gravity of host halos . in the massive pre - galactic halo , on the other hand , gas accumulated through accretion and merging is subject to the shear of differential rotation and/or the tidal distortions of the gravity of the host halo , so that gas clouds tend to be elongated or flattened to have disk - like structures .",
    "accordingly , the fragmentation of gas clouds is postponed until a higher density is reached than in the halos of smaller masses , leading to low - mass imf .",

    "they are characterized by the different abundance patterns , and in particular , we find one - to - one correspondence to the average enhancements of zn and co , though for the latter , the most metal - rich break has to be confirmed by future observations .",
    "\\(3 ) there are also variations in the scatter of distributions of @xmath115 among elements and for populations .",
    "the scatters little differ between pop  iid and pop  iic despite the shift of average enhancement .",
    "it is as small as typical errors of observations for ca and all heavier elements while much larger for the the lighter elements , c , mg , and si , studied . between pop  iib and pop  iic ,",
    "some correlation is discerned for the scatters to increase with the variation of mean enhancement .",

    "stars of two lower - metallicity pops   iia and iib spread out to @xmath45 kpc or more , and stars of two higher - metallicity pops  iic and iid are flattened near the galactic plane .",

    "\\(5 ) the variations in the abundance patterns have different origins .",
    "the transition from pop  iic to pop  iid is attributable to the delayed iron production by type ia sne in the same star forming site .",

    "the difference between pop  iib and pop  iic is explicable in terms of the change in imf , coupled with the mass dependence of sn yields , but not by the metallicity since they coexist over the wide metallicity range . for pop  iib and",

    "we may conceive of their sites as two different circumstances of star formation during the merger processes of halos .",

    "<S> we study the enrichment histories for nine elements , c , four @xmath0-elements of mg , si , ca , and ti , sc , and three iron - peak elements of co , ni , and zn , by using a large number of stellar data , collected by the stellar abundances for galactic archaeology ( saga ) database . </S>",
    "<S> we find statistically significant changes , or breaks , of the mean abundance ratios to iron at three metallicities of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . across the first one , the mean abundance ratios decrease with the metallicity by similar extents for all the elements with the sufficient data . across the latter two , downward </S>",
    "<S> trends with the metallicity are also detected but for limited elements , c , co , zn , and possibly sc , and for two of co and zn , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the breaks define four stellar populations with the different abundance patters which are dominant in each metallicity range divided by the breaks , pop  iia , iib , iic , and iid in order of increasing metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> we also explore their spatial distributions with the spectroscopic distances to demonstrate that pops  iia and iib spread over the galactic halo while pops  iic and iid are observed near the galactic plane . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , pop  iic stars emerge around @xmath4 and coexist with pop  iib stars , segregated by the spatial distributions . </S>",
    "<S> our results reveal two distinct modes of star formation during the early stages of galaxy formation , which are associated with the variations of imf and the spatial distribution of remnant low - mass stars . for the two lower - metallicity populations , the enhancements of zn and co indicate a high - mass and top - heavy imf together with the statistics on the carbon - enhanced stars . for the two higher - metallicity populations , on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the difference in the abundance patterns is attributable to the delayed contribution of sne ia , indicative of a low - mass imf and the specific star formation rate comparable to the present - day galactic disk . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the relevance to the kinematically resolved structures of the galactic halo and the possible sites of these populations within the framework of hierarchical structure formation scenario .    </S>",
