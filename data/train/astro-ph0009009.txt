    "diffuse @xmath0-ray emission of the galactic disk carries unique information about the fluxes and the spatial distribution of galactic cosmic rays ( crs ) .",
    "therefore it is believed that the solution of the long - standing problem of the origin of galactic crs essentially depends on the success of observational gamma - ray astronomy .",
    "indeed , the separation of the radiation components associated with the electronic and nucleonic components in a broad energy region from 1 mev to 100 tev would allow determination of the fluxes and energy spectra of crs in different parts of the galactic disk , and thus would provide an important insight to the character of propagation of crs in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "a proper understanding of the latter is a necessary condition for accurate estimates of the luminosity of the galaxy in crs .",
    "our present knowledge about the propagation of crs is based on conclusions derived from the interpretation of the mass composition and the content of the secondary anti - particles ( positrons , antiprotons ) of the _ locally _ observed crs .",
    "although rather effective ( see e.g. swordy 1993 , strong et al .",
    "1998 ) , this method requires a number of _ model - dependent _ assumptions .",
    "moreover , it is not yet obvious that the locally observed crs could be taken as undisputed representatives of the whole galactic population of relativistic particles .",
    "for example , erlykin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) recently argued that the fluxes of crs could be dominated by a single or few local sources / accelerators .",
    "this statement is certainly true at least for the observed @xmath5 electrons which suffer severe synchrotron and ic energy losses , and thus could reach us , for any reasonable diffusion coefficient , only from the sites no farther than a few hundred parsecs ( nishimura et al .",
    "1980 , aharonian et al . 1995 ) .",
    "therefore the diffuse galactic @xmath0-rays seem to be the best carriers of information about the production sites and propagation of accelerated charged particles in the galactic disk ( see e.g. ramana murthy & wolfendale 1993 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the diffuse non - thermal synchrotron radiation of the ism at radio and possibly also at x - ray wavelengths provide an additional and complementary information , but it concerns only the _ electronic _ component of crs in two extreme energy bands below @xmath6 and above @xmath7 , respectively .    the extraction of the truly diffuse @xmath0-ray emission , i.e. the radiation produced by cr electrons , protons and nuclei interacting with the ambient interstellar gas and photon fields , is not an easy task because of a non - negligible contamination due to weak but numerous unresolved discrete sources . before the launch of the compton gamma ray observatory ( gro ) the information about the diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray background",
    "was essentially limited to the energy region between 100 mev and few gev obtained by the sas-2 ( fichtel et al .",
    "1975 ) and cos b ( mayer - hasselwander et al . 1982 ) @xmath0-ray missions . the observations and theoretical models based on the results of these satellites",
    "were comprehensively reviewed by bloemen ( 1989 ) . in brief , these data have revealed a good correlation between the high energy @xmath0-ray fluxes and the column density of the interstellar hydrogen which was a demonstration of the existence of a truly diffuse galactic gamma radiation .",
    "the observations of the diffuse @xmath0-ray background conducted in 90 s by the osse , comptel , and egret detectors aboard compton gro resulted in good quality data over five decades in energy of @xmath0-rays ( see hunter et al .",
    "1997a , and references therein ) .",
    "these results initiated extensive theoretical studies of different @xmath0-ray production mechanisms in the ism ( e.g. bertsch et al . 1993 , giller et al .",
    "1995 , fathoohi et al .",
    "1995 , gralewicz et al .",
    "1997 , mori 1997 , porter & protheroe 1997 , moskalenko & strong 1998 , strong et al .",
    "1998 , pohl & esposito 1998 ) .",
    "in this paper we report the results of our study of different @xmath0-ray production processes in the ism .",
    "we discuss the fluxes of diffuse non - thermal galactic radiation of both nucleonic and electronic origin in a very broad energy region from hard x - rays to ultra - high energy @xmath0-rays .",
    "although at the first glance the problem seems to be very complicated and confused because of several competing production mechanisms , the existing data of diffuse galactic @xmath0-radiation do allow rather definite conclusions concerning the relative contributions of different production processes in each specific energy band of @xmath0-rays .",
    "a separate interest represents the diffuse @xmath0-radiation in the very high energy ( vhe ) domain . in this paper",
    "we limit our study by the diffuse radiation of the _ inner part _ of galaxy at @xmath8 .",
    "the inner galaxy is not only the experimentally best studied region in diffuse @xmath0-rays , but also , it presents a prime interest because of an enhanced , as currently believed , spatial concentration of cr sources in the central part of the galaxy .",
    "we emphasize the importance of the multiwavelength approach in solution of the problem , and predict a range of @xmath0-ray fluxes which could be examined by forthcoming satellite - borne and ground based @xmath0-ray detectors .",
    "we consider a model that assumes diffusive propagation of relativistic protons / nuclei and electrons in the galaxy .",
    "we will compare our model calculations with observations of the diffuse @xmath0-radiation of the galactic disc at @xmath9 .",
    "thus , although the halo of galactic crs may extend up to heights of a few kpc ( e.g. see berezinsky et al .",
    "1990 , bloemen et al . 1993 ) , we will need to know the _",
    "mean _ spectrum of crs only in a region close to the galactic plane .",
    "we approximate this region as a disk with a half - thickness @xmath10 , and a surface @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the mean radius of the galaxy .",
    "an important parameter for calculations of the diffuse @xmath0-radiation is the mean line - of - sight depth @xmath14 in the direction of the inner galaxy , which basically represents the central part of the galactic disk , with some radius @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the distance of the sun from the center of the galaxy .",
    "because the densities of the gas and photon fields in the inner galaxy are generally estimated to be significantly higher than at galactocentric distances @xmath17 , the inner galactic disk should be responsible for most of the diffuse flux detected at low galactic latitudes , neglecting even the effect of a possible gradient of cr density towards the center of the galaxy .",
    "thus , the mean value of @xmath14 can be reasonably estimated as @xmath18 .",
    "the diffusion equation for the energy distribution @xmath19 of relativistic particles can be written in a general form as ( ginzburg & syrovatskii 1964 ) : @xmath20 \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the fluid velocity of the gas containing relativistic particles , and @xmath22 describes their total energy losses where we include also the adiabatic energy loss term @xmath23 ( e.g. owens & jokipii 1977 , lerche & schlickeiser 1982 ) .",
    "@xmath24 is the spatial diffusion coefficient , and @xmath25 $ ] is a functional standing for various acceleration terms of relativistic particles ( i.e. the sources of crs ) .",
    "the integration of eq.(1 ) over the volume @xmath26 results in a convenient equation for the total energy distribution function of particles @xmath27 in the galactic disk at the heights @xmath28 .",
    "the term @xmath29 leads to @xmath30 .",
    "the volume integral of the two first terms in the right hand side of eq.(1 ) results in : @xmath31\\,{\\rm d}^3 r   & = &   \\\\     \\oint_{s_{\\rm tot } }   d\\,({\\bf e}\\ , { \\rm grad}_{\\bf r } f)\\ , { \\rm d } s   & - & \\oint_{s_{\\rm tot } } ( { \\bf e \\ , u } ) f   \\ , { \\rm d } s   \\ ; . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here * e * is a unit vector perpendicular to the surface element @xmath32 directed outward from the disk .",
    "these terms describe the diffusive and convective escape of particles from the disk through its surface @xmath33 .    the first surface integral in eq.(2 )",
    "can be simplified if we take into account that the cr density at heights @xmath34 , where the diffusion dominates ( see below ) , may be significantly higher than at @xmath35 , and approximate @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the volume averaged energy distribution function of relativistic particles , and @xmath38 is the characteristic thickness of the transition layer describing the decline ( i.e. the gradient ) of the density of particles at energy @xmath39 . taking into account that the total energy distribution of particles @xmath40 , one finds @xmath41 where @xmath42 has a meaning of a characteristic diffusive escape time of relativistic electrons from the galactic disk : @xmath43 here @xmath44 corresponds to the mean diffusion coefficient @xmath45 on the surface @xmath46 of the disk .    the second surface integral in eq.(2 )",
    "can be reduced to the form @xmath47 , which describes a convective escape of electrons from the disk through its surface due to the galactic wind driven by the pressure of crs and of the thermal gas ( e.g. bloemen et al . 1993 , breitschwerdt et al .",
    "1993 , zirakashvili et al 1996 ) : @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the wind velocity on the surface of the galactic disk which could reach @xmath50 ( zirakashvili et al . 1996 ) at the height @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the _ mean _ convective escape time of crs from the galactic disk can be estimated as @xmath52    the parameter @xmath53 in eq.(5 ) is the ratio of the mean density @xmath54 of particles in the disk ( i.e. an average over @xmath55 ) to their density @xmath56 at the disk surface , @xmath57 .",
    "therefore one could expect that @xmath58 and generally it may be energy - dependent as well , @xmath59 .",
    "calculations of the spatial and energy distribution @xmath60 of the galactic crs in the framework of the diffusion - convection model show ( lerche & schlickeiser 1980 ; see also lerche & schlickeiser 1982 , bloemen et al .",
    "1993 ) that at elevations @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a characteristic height of the diffusion dominated region for particles with energy @xmath39 , the spatial density @xmath63 is almost independent of @xmath64 .",
    "thus , at energies @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is found from the equation @xmath67 , the parameter @xmath68 . in the approximation @xmath69 for the galactic wind speed and @xmath70 with @xmath71 for the diffusion coefficient , the height @xmath72 ( see e.g. bloemen et al .",
    "this is basically the height at which the characteristic time scale of the diffusive propagation @xmath73 equals the convection time scale @xmath74 .",
    "the energy @xmath66 can be estimated of order of a few gev , taking into account that at these energies @xmath75 ( e.g. berezinsky et al . 1990 ) and that @xmath76 ( e.g. zirakashvili et al .",
    "1996 ) , which result in @xmath77 .    in the convection dominated region , @xmath78 ,",
    "the spatial density of particles starts to decline as @xmath79 with @xmath80 ( see lerche & schlickeiser 1992 , bloemen et al .",
    "1993 ) , thus @xmath81 .",
    "therefore at energies @xmath82 the parameter @xmath83 should gradually increase , and in principle could be approximated as @xmath84 , with an exponent @xmath85 much smaller than @xmath86 because at these energies the mean particle density @xmath54 , as compared with @xmath87 , should also decline .",
    "however , taking into account that @xmath85 is significantly less than 1 , and in order to avoid an introduction of an additional model parameter , below we approximate the convective escape time as energy - independent , i.e. with @xmath88 at all energies .",
    "for the cr proton component this approximation is well justified , because for @xmath89 of order of a few gev the energy region @xmath82 effectively corresponds to sub - relativistic protons which do not represent an interest for this study . such a simplification appears reasonable also for cr electrons , because at energies @xmath90 the spectral modifications of the electrons are defined mainly by their coulomb energy losses which take place on time scales significantly shorter than the escape losses .",
    "the volume integral of the third term on the right side of eq.(1 ) describes the volume - averaged energy losses of the electrons with the rate @xmath91 . at last",
    ", the volume integral of the 4th term in eq.(1 ) describes the sources of accelerated particles @xmath92 inside the volume @xmath93 .",
    "the final equation for the overall distribution of electrons then reads : @xmath94 here @xmath95 is the `` diffusive + convective '' escape time of particles : @xmath96^{-1}\\ ; .\\ ] ]    the range of actual energy dependence of @xmath95 is limited at high energies because the diffusive escape time can not be less than the light travel time @xmath97 .",
    "this obvious requirement formally follows from the condition that the characteristic length - scale @xmath98 for spatial gradients in the distribution function @xmath63 can not be less than the mean electron scattering path @xmath99 , otherwise the diffusion approximation implied in eq.(1 ) fails . taking into account that for relativistic particles @xmath100 , from eq.(4 ) we find that indeed @xmath101 .",
    "the diffusive escape time can be then presented in the form @xmath102 where @xmath103 . since @xmath104 increases for decreasing @xmath39 , @xmath95 given by eq.(7 ) becomes energy _",
    "independent _ below some @xmath66 when @xmath105 .",
    "neglecting at these energies @xmath106 in eq.(8 ) , from eq.(7 ) then follows that in the case of a pure power - law approximation for @xmath107 as in eq.(8 ) the overall escape time can be presented in the form @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "note that generally the power - law index @xmath109 in eq.(8 ) for the diffusive escape time in the leaky - box type eq .",
    "( 6 ) should be smaller than the index @xmath110 of the diffusion coefficient @xmath70 .",
    "since a faster diffusion of more energetic particles tends to smooth out the gradients of the distribution function @xmath63 more effectively , the characteristic length - scale @xmath98 would increase with energy . for a power - law approximation @xmath111 the index @xmath112 , therefore from eq.(4 )",
    "follows that @xmath113 .",
    "this consideration may help to qualitatively understand a formal discrepancy between cr spectral modifications due to particle propagation effects predicted in the framework of simplified leaky - box models and more accurate diffusion - convection propagation models .",
    "calculations for the latter models show ( e.g. lerche & schlickeiser 1980 , bloemen et al .",
    "1993 ) that at elevations @xmath114 , where the diffusive propagation dominates over convection , the initial power - law spectrum of injected particles , @xmath115 , steepens by a factor @xmath116 , whereas at @xmath117 the increase of the effectiveness of the convective propagation results ( in the case of negligible energy losses ) in a steepening to only a half of the power - law exponent of the diffusion coefficient , @xmath118 .",
    "meanwhile , the ( diffusive ) escape losses in the leaky - box models result in a single power - law spectrum @xmath119 .",
    "such a difference between the predictions of the cr spectra in the framework of diffusion - convection models and leaky - box type models could be qualitatively explained , if we take into account that @xmath54 represents the mean particle spectrum integrated over @xmath120 , which is therefore contributed ( in fractions varying with @xmath39 ) by both ` diffusion ' and ` convection ' dominated regions .",
    "thus , the power - law index @xmath109 for the escape time should be effectively in the region @xmath121 .    assuming a time - dependent injection function @xmath92 , eq.(6 ) can be used for determination of the overall energy distribution of relativistic particles in a general case of a non - stationary source .",
    "if the energy losses are independent of time , the solution to this equation , in terms of spatial density functions @xmath122 and @xmath123 , reads : @xmath124 here the variable @xmath125 corresponds to the energy of a particle at an instant @xmath126 which has the energy @xmath39 at the instant @xmath127 , and is determined from the equation @xmath128 for a quasi - stationary injection of electrons into the ism on time - scales exceeding the escape time @xmath129 the energy distribution of particles becomes time - independent .    for calculations of the energy distribution of cr protons in the galaxy",
    "we take into account the energy losses connected with their inelastic interactions with the ism gas , and the adiabatic losses of particles in a gradually accelerating wind . in a simple approximation @xmath130 , used e.g. by lerche & schlickeiser ( 1982 ) and bloemen et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , the mean adiabatic energy loss term @xmath131 is found after a simple integration @xmath132 in the volume of the disk with @xmath133 .",
    "this expression corresponds to @xmath134 with @xmath135 for @xmath136 .    for the energy losses of particles due to their interactions with the gas , which contribute to the overall energy loss term in eq.(6 )",
    ", we should use the volume - averaged gas density @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the gas density in terms of ` h - atoms ' . in order to estimate @xmath139 , the hi density distribution by dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) can be taken : a sum of two gaussians with central densities @xmath140 and @xmath141 and fwhms of 210 and 530pc , respectively , and an exponential with the central density @xmath142 and a scale height @xmath143 .",
    "the molecular gas layer can be approximated by a further gaussian with the mid - plane density @xmath144 and dispersion 70 pc ( bloemen 1987 ) .",
    "such a gas density profile results in the mean hydrogen density @xmath145 in the region @xmath146 .    an essential process which defines the spectra of both cr protons and electrons in the galaxy is their energy dependent escape . beside this , for calculations of the energy distribution of the electron component of crs we take into account the ionization ( coulomb ) losses which dominate the overall energy losses of cr electrons in the ism at energies below a few 100 mev , the adiabatic losses , the radiative ( synchrotron and inverse compton ) losses , and the bremsstrahlung losses .",
    "note that the bremsstrahlung loss term has practically the same energy dependence as the adiabatic loss term , @xmath147 ( neglecting a weak logarithmic increase with energy , e.g. see ginzburg 1979 ) , but for @xmath148 the cooling time @xmath149 exceeds the adiabatic cooling time by a factor @xmath150 .",
    "therefore for the formation of the energy spectra of cr electrons ( but _ not _ for the radiation flux ! ) the bremsstrahlung losses are by a factor of 3 less effective than the adiabatic losses . at energies above several",
    "gev the total energy losses of the electrons are dominated by the radiative energy losses due to synchrotron emission in the ism magnetic field of order of several @xmath151 , and due to the ic scattering of the electrons on different diffuse target photon fields .    besides these processes , which should be taken into account for calculations of energy distribution of cr electrons in the disk , in this paper",
    "we discuss also a possible contribution to the fluxes of diffuse galactic radiation caused by annihilation of relativistic positrons in ` flight ' with the ambient thermal electrons . in principle , it is possible to include also this process into calculations of @xmath54 , considering the energy distributions for @xmath152 and @xmath153 separately , and introducing in the equation for @xmath154 an additional term which describes the disappearance of the positrons due to annihilation on a timescale @xmath155 .",
    "however , this term does not have a significant impact on the formation of the spectrum @xmath154 , because at any energy the annihilation time @xmath156 , for the mean density @xmath157 , is significantly larger than both the coulomb loss time and the escape times involved .    for both cr protons and electrons injected into interstellar medium",
    "we assume a stationary source function ( per unit volume ) in a ` standard ' power - law form with an exponential cutoff at some energy @xmath158 : @xmath159    the flux of diffuse radiation with energy @xmath160 in a given direction is defined by the unit volume emissivity @xmath161 integrated along the line of sight : @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the mean emissivity , and @xmath14 is the characteristic line - of - sight depth of the emission region .",
    "it is convenient to describe the flux of @xmath0-rays produced at interactions of crs with the ism gas by the emissivity per 1 h - atom ( see e.g. bloemen 1989 ) .",
    "then the observed intensity of @xmath0-rays linearly depends on the column density @xmath164 along the line of sight .",
    "it is worth notice that the estimate of the mean hydrogen density @xmath165 , which defines the mean _ emissivities _ along the line of sight in direction close to the galactic plane , may be somewhat higher ( by a factor about 2 ) than the mean gas density @xmath139 which should be used for the calculation of the mean ( at @xmath166 ) energy distribution of particles in eq.(9 ) .",
    "such an ` enhancement ' of @xmath167 should be allowed , and could be understood if one takes into account that at low galactic latitudes the radiation fluxes due to cr interactions with the gas are not equally contributed by the entire @xmath166 region , but effectively only by a fraction of this region close to the galactic plane , with a thickness of a few 100 pc , where the spatial concentrations of _ both _ the relativistic particles and ( especially ) of the ism gas are higher than their respective mean values averaged over @xmath166 . for calculations of the ic @xmath0-ray",
    "fluxes the same characteristic energy densities of the diffuse galactic photon fields as for the eq.(9 ) should be used , because at elevations @xmath168 these densities are still approximately the same as in the galactic plane ( e.g. see chi & wolfendale 1990 ) .",
    "there are four principal processes of production of non - thermal hard x - rays and @xmath0-rays in the ism by cr electrons : inverse compton ( ic ) scattering , bremsstrahlung , annihilation of positrons , as well as synchrotron radiation provided that the electrons are accelerated beyond 100 tev . in this section",
    "we discuss the first three mechanisms ; the synchrotron radiation of hard x - rays will be discussed in sec .  5 in the context of the ic radiation of highest energy electrons .",
    "the calculations of the diffuse ic @xmath0-rays require knowledge of the low - frequency target photons and of the flux of electrons in ism .",
    "the photon fields which are important for production of ic @xmath0-rays in the ism are 2.7k cosmic microwave background radiation ( mbr ) , and the diffuse galactic radiation contributed by the starlight and dust photons with peak intensities around @xmath169 and @xmath170 , respectively . while the density of 2.7k mbr is universal , with @xmath171 , the densities of diffuse galactic radiation fields vary from site to site , and actually are model dependent .",
    "detailed calculations of chi & wolfendale ( 1991 ) show that the starlight energy density increases from the local value @xmath172 ( mathis et al .",
    "1983 ) up to @xmath173 in the central 1kpc region of the inner galaxy . for calculations below we use the mean value @xmath174 .",
    "the energy density of the fir produced by dust in the galactic plane is more uncertain , and is typically estimated from @xmath175 ( e.g. mathis et al . 1983 ) to @xmath176 ( chi & wolfendale 1991 ) . for calculations of the ic @xmath0-ray fluxes below",
    "we adopt @xmath177 . fortunately , large uncertainties in @xmath178 appear not crucial because at all @xmath0-ray energies the contribution from ic upscattering of 2.7 k target photons significantly exceeds the ic fluxes produced on fir ( see below ) .",
    "another source of uncertainties in calculations of the fluxes of diffuse @xmath0-rays is the lack of independent information about the flux and the spectrum of galactic electrons above several gev . while radio measurements allow definite conclusions about the average electron flux below a few gev , at higher energies the electron fluxes in the galaxy are in principle model dependent .",
    "the standard interpretation of the energy spectrum of crs usually assumes a uniform and continuous distribution of sources in the galaxy both in space and time .",
    "whereas for the nucleonic component of crs this approximation can be considered as a reasonable working hypothesis , the validity of this assumption for the electrons is questionable at least for the high energy part of the measured spectrum which extends up to 2 tev ( taira et al .",
    "because of severe radiative losses , the sources of these electrons could not be located well beyond a few 100pc ( nishimura et al .",
    "1980 , aharonian et al .",
    "1995 ) , and therefore the measured electron spectrum might not be applicable for calculations of @xmath0-radiation from the distant parts of the galactic disk .    in fig",
    ". 1 the energy spectrum of cr electrons calculated assuming a uniform and continuous distribution of the sources in the galactic disk ( solid curve ) is decomposed to show the contributions from sources located at distances @xmath179 for different @xmath180 .",
    "it is seen that even at energies @xmath181 the total flux of the observed electrons is dominated by particles accelerated and injected into ism at distances @xmath182 from the sun . at tev energies the sources beyond 500 pc contribute only @xmath183 of the total electron flux .",
    "since for these relatively small spatial scales the assumption of continuous distribution ( both in space and in time ) of cr sources may not be well justified , the spectrum and the flux of high energy electrons at tev and higher energies may show significant variations in different sites of the galactic disk ( atoyan et al .",
    "in particular , one could expect a significant enhancement of the electron fluxes in the central region of the galaxy due to presumably higher concentration of cosmic ray sources there .",
    "therefore we may allow deviations of the predicted electron distribution in the inner galaxy from the observed fluxes , perhaps except for the region below few gev where the radio observations , provide information about the average spectrum of galactic electrons along the line of sight ( see also porter & protheroe 1997 , pohl & esposito 1998 , strong et al . 1998 ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that because of a significant absorption of radio fluxes in the interstellar medium , a _ direct _ information about the spectra of cr electrons in the inner galaxy",
    "is not actually available .",
    "the fluxes of radio electrons in the galaxy are generally deduced using the observations from the directions of the galactic poles or the anticenter ( e.g. see webber et al . 1980 ) under an assumption of a homogeneous distribution of crs in the galactic disk .    in fig.2",
    "we show the average spectrum of electrons in the inner part of the galaxy calculated in the framework of the model described in section 2 , assuming a power - law index for the electron injection spectrum @xmath184 , and normalizing the energy density @xmath185 to @xmath186 . for the parameters used in calculations ,",
    "this normalization requires an acceleration rate of electrons    @xmath187    this implies that for the inner part of the galactic disk , with @xmath188 and a half thickness @xmath189 , the overall acceleration power should be about @xmath190 . in the energy region between 100 mev and 1 gev the energy losses of electrons are dominated by the adiabatic losses and the bremsstrahlung , with @xmath191 , which do not change the original ( acceleration ) spectrum of electrons .",
    "indeed , it is seen from fig .  2 that in this energy region , which is responsible for synchrotron radio emission , the electron spectrum remains rather close to the injection spectrum .",
    "therefore the spectral index of the observed synchrotron radio emission contains almost model - independent information about the injection spectrum of electrons . at energies below 100 mev",
    "the electron spectrum suffers significant deformation ( flattening ) because of ionization losses , and at energies above 1 gev the energy distribution of the electrons steepens because of a combination of escape and radiative ( synchrotron and inverse compton ) losses .",
    "the calculated fluxes of diffuse @xmath0-rays produced by electrons are shown in fig .",
    "the spectrum of ic @xmath0-rays below the highest energy observed by egret , @xmath192 , is not very sensitive to the exact value of the cutoff energy @xmath193 in the injection spectrum of electrons , provided that @xmath193 exceeds 10 tev . for the energy density of the diffuse interstellar",
    "nir / optical radiation we have assumed @xmath194 . for this value of @xmath195 the ic radiation component produced on the galactic starlight photons ( dot - dashed line ) somewhat exceeds in the energy region 10 mev - 30 gev the ic flux produced on 2.7k mbr ( dashed line ) .",
    "the ` fir ' component of ic radiation ( 3-dot  dashed line ) calculated for @xmath196 at any @xmath0-ray energy contributes less than @xmath197 of the total ic flux .    in its turn , the overall ic @xmath0-ray flux can account , for the chosen infrared photon field densities , only for @xmath198 of the observed @xmath0-ray fluxes both at mev ( `` comptel '' ) and gev ( `` egret '' ) energies ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . for the same average electron",
    "fluxes shown in fig.2 , the fluxes of ic radiation could be increased assuming formally a larger depth @xmath14 of the emission region .",
    "however , the value of the mean @xmath199 assumed in fig.3 is already large , and hardly it could be significantly increased further . another way to increase the flux of ic @xmath0-rays is possible if we assume that the energy density of the electrons in the inner galaxy is significantly larger than @xmath200 . however , for a fixed gas column density @xmath164 this would automatically increase also the flux of the bremsstrahlung @xmath0-rays , resulting in an overproduction of diffuse radiation in the @xmath201 region ( see below ) .    the possibilities to increase the flux of ic @xmath0-rays to a level significantly higher than in fig.3 are essentially limited also by the radio observations . the density of the galactic electrons in the energy range 70mev to 1.2gev shown in fig .",

    "unfortunately , at low frequencies the absorption of radio fluxes from the inner galaxy at low galactic latitudes is very significant , so the diffuse radio flux @xmath217 is uncertain .",
    "eq.(15 ) predicts that this analytical estimate of the ic flux ( for @xmath218 ) would be in agreement with the results of numerical calculations shown by the dot - dashed line in fig .  3 for the un - absorbed radio flux from the inner galaxy @xmath219 , i.e. by a factor 5 larger than the galactic radio flux observed in the polar directions , @xmath220 ( webber et al.1980 ) .",
    "this implies a size of the halo of the galactic crs extending up to heights @xmath221 ( to be compared with @xmath222 used in fig .",

    "fig .  3 and eq.(14 ) show that any attempt to explain the observed @xmath0-ray fluxes at @xmath223 , @xmath224 by ic radiation either would require an energy density of the nir / optical radiation at a level of @xmath225 , which is much larger than it is generally accepted for the density of starlight photons in the ism , or would require a very high flux of the radio electrons in the inner galaxy .",
    "the latter assumption would imply , however , very high radio fluxes , exceeding by more than one order of magnitude the flux detected from the direction of the galactic poles , unless we assume a ( unrealistically ) low magnetic field , @xmath226 or so , in the galactic plane",

    "since the bremsstrahlung @xmath0-rays below 1 gev are produced by the same electrons which are responsible also for the galactic synchrotron radio emission , the differential flux @xmath228 of this radiation in the region from @xmath229 to @xmath230 should have a characteristic power - law slope with an index coinciding with the spectral index of the radio electrons @xmath231 . the results of numerical calculations are shown in fig .  3 by open dots .",

    "the ratio of the fluxes @xmath264 does not depend on the ambient gas density , and for a given ratio @xmath265 depends only on the spectrum of electrons , being higher for steep electron spectra .    the flux of annihilation radiation calculated for the spectrum of electrons shown in fig .  2 , and assuming @xmath266 content of positrons ,",

    "it is seen that under such an assumption the contribution of the annihilation radiation at 1 mev exceeds the fluxes produced by all other radiation processes , including the bremsstrahlung .",
    "therefore we conclude that depending on the ( unknown ) content of low - energy ( @xmath267 ) positrons in crs , this process may result in a significant enhancement of the diffuse radiation at mev energies .",

    "we note only that pulsars could be potential suppliers of low - energy @xmath271 pairs into the electronic component of crs ( see e.g. harding & ramaty 1987 ) .",
    "also , we may speculate that a moderate acceleration of beta - decay positrons produced at early stages in snrs would result in such an enhancement .",
    "obviously these possibilities require thorough examination , therefore the adopted in this paper large content of positrons at low energies should be considered as a _ working hypothesis _ which helps to explain the mev excess in the galactic diffuse background radiation .",
    "the assumption that the process of annihilation of supra - thermal positrons in flight might significantly contribute to the diffuse low - energy @xmath0-radiation of the inner galaxy in principle would imply also a high flux of 0.511mev annihilation line radiation , and a rather broad continuum emission at @xmath272 due to annihilation of the thermalized positrons through the positronium channel .",
    "osse measurements ( purcell et al . 1993 ) have shown that the flux of the diffuse annihilation radiation detected from the inner galaxy is dominated ( @xmath273 , kinzer et al .",
    "1996 ) by the positronium annihilation , which consists of two components - a narrow 0.511 annihilation line and the @xmath0-ray continuum below 0.5 mev . at energies @xmath274 the diffuse @xmath0-ray emission of the inner galaxy",
    "is contributed mainly by the fluxes of these two components of the annihilation radiation ( not shown in fig .  3 ; but see e.g. hunter et al .",
    "the total flux of these photons is at the level @xmath275 ( see kinzer et al .",
    "1996 ) , which is equivalent to @xmath276 for the field of view @xmath277 of the osse instrument .",
    "our earlier calculations ( aharonian & atoyan 1981a ) show that in the approximation of an infinite interstellar medium , about @xmath278 of relativistic positrons would annihilate in flight on the thermal electrons of the same gas medium where they cool due to ( predominantly ) coulomb and bremsstrahlung energy losses .",
    "thus , in this case the total photon flux from the annihilation of the positrons after their thermalization in the ambient ism would be by a factor of 4 larger than the total photon flux due the annihilation of relativistic positrons .",
    "the integrated flux of the annihilation radiation by relativistic electrons shown in fig .  3 ( dotted curve ) ,",
    "is @xmath279 .",
    "therefore one could expect that the photon flux associated with the thermalized component of cr positrons would be as high as @xmath280 , provided that the positron content in the total flux of cr electrons is as high as @xmath281 , as assumed in fig .",
    "this flux is quite comparable with the annihilation radiation flux observed .",
    "we should note , however , that the ratio of cr positrons that annihilate after their thermalization to the positrons annihilating while remaining still relativistic may be in fact significantly ( by a factor of few ) lower because this estimate does not take into account the escape losses of particles from the thin gaseous disk of the galaxy .",
    "meanwhile , the positrons , both relativistic and thermalised , escape ( in particular , by convection ) from the disk on timescales comparable with , and even shorter than their cooling and annihilation times , which may therefore significantly reduce ( for the same high @xmath282 ) the flux of the annihilation radiation associated with the thermalized cr positrons . this problem needs , however , a separate study which is out of the scope of the present paper .    a possible source of relativistic positrons in the energy region below 100 mev , which presents a prime interest from the point of view of production of the continuum annihilation radiation ( by relativistic positrons ) and the subsequent production of the 0.511 mev line and three - photon positronium continuum ( by thermalized positrons ) , are interactions of cr protons and nuclei with the ambient gas via production and decay of secondary @xmath283-mesons",
    ". the total @xmath0-ray flux above 100 mev from the inner galaxy , associated with the @xmath3-decay component of diffuse radiation , can not significantly exceed @xmath284 ( see below ) , therefore it strongly limits the contribution of these positrons to the observed flux of 0.511 mev line , and consequently also to the @xmath0-ray continuum at @xmath285 .",
    "obviously a more copious mechanism for production of positrons in the galaxy with energy @xmath286 is needed in order to interpret the `` mev '' excess of the diffuse @xmath0-radiation of the inner galaxy .",
    "ejection of relativistic electron - positron pairs from the pulsar magnetospheres seems an interesting possibility .",
    "apparently , this question also needs a separate detailed study , which can not be done in this paper .    the overall flux of bremsstrahlung and ic diffuse @xmath0-rays is shown in fig .  3 by solid line",
    "it is seen that the @xmath0-radiation of the cr electrons is significantly below the measured spectrum in the entire energy range from 100mev to 30gev . due to the lack of independent information on the spectrum of high energy electrons with @xmath287 in the inner galaxy ,",
    "the predictions of diffuse @xmath0-radiation above several 100 mev could contain significant uncertainties .",
    "although both at 100 mev and 30 gev energies the deviation of the calculated fluxes from the measurements ( by a factor of @xmath288 should not be overemphasized , the gap by a factor of 5 to 7 around 1gev is not easy to explain by a reasonable set of model parameters .",
    "moreover , the flat shape of the overall flux produced by cr electrons can not explain the gev bump without violation of the fluxes observed at lower energies .",

    "therefore the `` sub - relativistic bremsstrahlung '' models require continuous injection of low - energy electrons and/or protons , e.g. by snrs , into the ism with uncomfortably large rates , especially if one tries to explain the fluxes of the low - energy x - rays , @xmath369 ( skibo et al .",
    "moreover , in the case of the proton bremsstrahlung the production of x - rays is tightly connected with the prompt @xmath0-ray line emission due to the excitation of the nuclei ( first of all , fe , c , o , etc . ) of the ambient gas by the same protons ( aharonian et al .",
    "therefore this allows robust upper limits on the flux of the proton bremsstrahlung x - rays based on the observed fluxes of diffuse @xmath0-rays at mev energies .",
    "the recent analysis by pohl ( 1998 ) , based on the comparison of the observed kev and mev fluxes leads to a conclusion that indeed the proton bremsstrahlung alone could not be responsible for the bulk of the diffuse galactic x - ray emission .",
    "an alternative mechanism for an explanation of the diffuse x - radiation of the galactic disc - the synchrotron emission of ultra - relativistic electrons in the interstellar magnetic fields - has been suggested by porter & protheroe ( 1997 ) .",
    "an obvious advantage of this mechanism , compared with the bremsstrahlung of sub - relativistic particles , is its almost @xmath370 efficiency of transformation of the kinetic energy of the electrons into the x - radiation . on the other hand this mechanism requires , for any reasonably ambient magnetic field , an efficient acceleration of electrons up to energies of @xmath371 .",
    "these electrons could hardly be produced by the shocks of snrs because of severe synchrotron losses on timescale @xmath372    comparing this time with the maximum rate of the diffusive shock acceleration ( lagage & cesarsky 1983 ) in the extreme limit of bohm diffusion , one easily finds an estimate of the maximum energy of accelerated electrons @xmath373 where @xmath374 is the shock speed .",
    "thus , for typical parameters of a snr in a stage close to its sedov phase , when the acceleration of the bulk of relativistic particles takes place ( e.g. berezhko & vlk 1997 ) , namely @xmath375 and @xmath376 , the characteristic maximum energy of accelerated electrons can not significantly exceed 100 tev .",
    "more probable sites for acceleration of electrons to energies @xmath377 could be the shocks terminating relativistic winds driven by pulsars .",
    "for example , it is widely believed that the electrons in the crab nebula are accelerated at the termination shock of the pulsar wind to energies @xmath378 ( see e.g. arons 1996 ) .",
    "an assumption that electrons could be accelerated well beyond 100 tev at the wind termination shocks of much older pulsars could then explain the diffuse hard x - ray background radiation of the galaxy as a synchrotron emission of these electrons .",
    "the life time of @xmath379 electrons does not exceed several hundred years , therefore they can not propagate a distance more ( and probably even much less ) than a few tens of parsec from their acceleration sites .",
    "it means that the synchrotron origin of the galactic diffuse x - ray background would be possible only in a form of _ superposition _ of the emission from a number of unresolved weak and _ continuous _ sources along the line of sight .",
    "these conditions could be satisfied e.g. by @xmath380 old pulsars , the overall number of which in the inner galaxy could be estimated up to @xmath381 if neutron stars are produced with a rate of about 1 per 30 yrs .    in fig .  7 we show the broad band diffuse radiation flux calculated in the framework of the model which assumes that",
    "besides the main population of crs ( presumably accelerated by the snr shocks ) , there is also a second population of electrons accelerated well beyond 100 tev at the pulsar wind termination shocks of old neutron stars / pulsars in the inner galaxy .",
    "the parameters for the first ( main ) population of accelerated particles , both the electrons and protons , are essentially the same as in fig .",
    "6 ( except for @xmath382 and @xmath383 used in fig .  7 ) .",
    "for the second electron population we assume an acceleration spectrum with @xmath384 and an exponential cutoff energy @xmath385 , but also a turnover of the spectrum at energies below 1tev .",
    "note that such a turnover at low energies is a characteristic feature of the electrons accelerated at the pulsar wind termination shocks ( see e.g. arons 1996 ) , which however does not affect the overall flux of diffuse @xmath0-rays below tev energies ( dominated by the radiation of the main component of crs ) . for the mean magnetic field of the ism in fig .",
    "7 we assume the same value as in fig .  6 , @xmath386 . but for the second electron component we assume significantly larger ambient field , @xmath387 , in order to fit the hard x - ray data . different magnetic fields for the first and second components of the synchrotron radiation can be understood if we remember that the multi - tev electrons cool very rapidly therefore they can not propagate very far from their accelerators .",
    "more specifically , the hypothesis that the _ second _ ( ultra - high energy ) population of electrons is produced at the termination shocks of relativistic pulsar winds ( which inject not only relativistic electrons , but also magnetic fields ) could explain also why the magnetic field @xmath388 could be much higher than the mean field @xmath389 in the galaxy .",
    "the assumption of high magnetic field @xmath388 becomes very important for a self - consistent interpretation of the ` diffuse ' flux of hard x - rays detected in the galactic plane in terms of synchrotron radiation of @xmath390 electrons , because otherwise the fluxes of ic radiation produced by the same electrons would exceed the upper flux limits reported by casa - mia collaboration at energies @xmath391 ( barione et al .",
    "1998 ) . as it is seen in fig .",
    "7 , the energy flux of osse exceeds the flux upper limits of casa by a factor of @xmath392 .",
    "the ratio of energy fluxes of synchrotron to ic radiations produced by an electron is about the ratio of the magnetic field to the soft photon field energy densities , i.e. @xmath393 , if the ic scattering occurs in the thomson limit , when the parameter @xmath394 ( @xmath395 is the mean energy of 2.7k mbr photons ) .",
    "actually , the ic scattering of @xmath396 electrons occurs in a moderate klein - nishina regime with @xmath397 . for these values of parameter @xmath398",
    "the emissivity of ic radiation is reduced ( compared with the thomson limit ) by a factor 5 - 10 , therefore the ratio of the synchrotron to ic fluxes @xmath392 implies a magnetic field @xmath399 .",
    "the acceleration power in the second electron component which is needed for interpretation of the hard x - ray background in fig .",
    "7 is about @xmath400 per @xmath401 , or about @xmath402 in the entire inner galactic disk with a radius about 8kpc and a thickness @xmath10 . for the overall number of such pulsars of order @xmath403",
    ", this implies a rather modest mean acceleration power per 1 ` old pulsar ' of about @xmath404 , i.e. by four orders of magnitude less than the power of the relativistic electron - positron wind of the crab pulsar .",
    "note that the kick velocities of the pulsars can be of order from a few 100 to @xmath405 , so the @xmath406 old pulsars would be able to propagate to distances @xmath407 , contributing therefore to the emission at the galactic latitudes up to several degree .",
    "note also that even for @xmath1 pulsars in the @xmath408 field of view of the inner galaxy considered here , the mean density of such pulsars on the sky corresponds to @xmath409 per square degree .",
    "therefore in principle for the hard x - ray / soft @xmath0-ray detectors , which typically do not have an excellent angular resolution , a superposition of the emission of large number of such relatively weak sources ( with sizes presumably @xmath410 ) in the field of view of the detector could imitate a `` diffuse '' emission .",
    "the diffuse galactic gamma ray emission carries a unique information , a proper understanding of which would eventually result in a quantitative theory of the origin of galactic cosmic rays . although the problem is essentially complicated and confused because of several competing mechanisms of production of diffuse @xmath0-rays , the data obtained by the comptel and egret detectors aboard compton gro allow rather definite conclusions concerning the relative contributions of different @xmath0-ray production mechanisms in the energy region from 1 mev to 30 gev .    at energies below 100 mev",
    "the diffuse @xmath0-radiation has an electronic origin . for a set of reasonable parameters for both the ism and cr electrons , the observed @xmath0-ray fluxes from 10 mev to 100 mev",
    "can be well explained by the superposition of the bremsstrahlung and the ic components of radiation of relativistic electrons . at lower energies",
    ", a non - negligible flux can be contributed by the annihilation of relativistic positrons with the ambient thermal electrons . moreover ,",
    "if the content of positrons at energies @xmath285 is close to @xmath411 , the @xmath0-ray ray flux around 1 mev would be dominated by the non - thermal annihilation radiation . between several mev and 100 mev",
    "the radiation is dominated by the electron bremsstrahlung .",
    "this result agrees with previous studies ( kniffen & fichtel 1981 , sacher & schnfelder 1984 , gehrels & tueller 1993 ) .    above 100 mev",
    "the ic process dominates in the production of diffuse @xmath0-rays , but at these energies a new mechanism is needed in order to explain the so called `` gev bump '' detected by egret .",
    "we believe that this distinct emission feature of the inner galaxy could be naturally explained by @xmath0-rays of nucleonic origin produced at the interactions of cr protons and nuclei with the ambient interstellar gas .",
    "indeed , the overall observed mev / gev emission of the inner galaxy is well fitted by the @xmath3-decay @xmath0-rays ( on top of `` ic + bremsstrahlung + annihilation '' contribution by cr electrons ) provided that the spectrum of cr protons in the inner galactic disk at low energies is substantially flatter than the spectrum of directly observed local crs .",
    "in particular , a proton spectrum in the form of eq.(26 ) with @xmath412 , @xmath413 and @xmath414 , which could be formed due to a reasonable combination of diffusive and convective escape time - scales of crs from the inner galactic disk , is able to explain very well the observed diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray spectrum ( see fig .  6 and fig .  7 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the total `` @xmath3+ic '' spectrum the contribution of @xmath3-decay @xmath0-ray component gradually decreases since the spectrum of cr protons at high energies with an index @xmath415 is steeper than the spectrum of the diffuse gamma radiation with a power - law index @xmath416 observed at energies above several gev .",
    "however , this decline is compensated by the hard ic component of radiation which at energies above 30 gev becomes the dominant contributor to the overall @xmath0-ray flux . for convenience of further discussion , we will call this possibility for explanation of the gev bump in the observed @xmath0-ray spectrum the scenario 1 .",
    "another possibility for explanation of the spectrum of @xmath0-rays up to 30 gev could be a single power - law spectrum of cr protons with @xmath417 , but then we should assume a significant reduction of the ic contribution to the overall @xmath0-ray flux at such high energies .",
    "this possibility , which we call the scenario 2 , can be realized if the acceleration spectrum of cr electrons does not extend to tev energies . in this scenario",
    "the @xmath0-ray fluxes below several gev are explained , as in the scenario 1 , by superposition of the electronic and nucleonic components of radiation .",
    "however at higher energies the @xmath0-ray flux would be strongly dominated by @xmath3-decay component of radiation . for the acceleration spectrum of protons with @xmath418 , the required single power - law spectrum of protons in the inner galaxy with @xmath419",
    "could be formed if @xmath420 and @xmath421 ( see eq .  26 ) .",
    "this conclusion would imply that the mean time of convective escape of crs from the disk is much larger than the diffusive escape of particles at 10 gev .",
    "these two scenarios predict essentially different origin of @xmath0-rays in the vhe domain . while in the scenario 1 the @xmath0-ray background of the galactic disk at @xmath422 is contributed mainly by ic scattering of multi tev electrons on 2.7 k mbr , in the scenario 2 the vhe @xmath0-ray flux is dominated by @xmath3-decay @xmath0-rays",
    ". therefore the future spectroscopic measurements of the diffuse radiation of the inner galaxy at low ( @xmath423 ) and high ( e.g. @xmath424 ) galactic latitudes by glast at @xmath425 , and by imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope arrays h.e.s.s . and",
    "cangaroo-3 ( both to be located in the southern hemisphere ) above 100 gev could provide crucial information about the character of propagation of tev cosmic rays in the galactic disk ( weekes et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "because all target photon fields for production of ic @xmath0-rays extend practically with the same intensity ( see e.g. chi & wolfendale 1991 ) well above the characteristic height @xmath426 of the gaseous disk , and since the fluxes of very high energy electrons above the galactic plane up to several hundred pc could be still significant , the realization of the scenario 1 can be distinguished from the scenario 2 by different spectra of high energy radiation detected at different galactic latitudes @xmath427 .",
    "in particular , the scenario 1 predicts an increase of the relative contribution of the ic component to the @xmath0-ray flux , therefore we should expect some flattening ( depending on the rate of decline of vhe electron fluxes above the galactic plane ) of the spectrum of @xmath0-rays at @xmath427 larger than few degree .",
    "note , however , that the measurements at different @xmath427 could not distinguish between the scenario 2 , which interprets the observed galactic ` excess ' gev radiation in terms of truly diffuse emission of ( mainly ) nucleonic origin from the models interpreting this radiation as a superposition of contributions from unresolved snrs ( vlk 1999 , berezhko & vlk 2000 ) , or `` active '' molecular clouds ( aharonian 1991 , aharonian & atoyan 1996 ) .",
    "the level of contamination of the _ truly diffuse _",
    "radiation of the disk by faint , but numerous @xmath0-ray sources could be properly estimated only by future measurements of the angular distribution of the galactic background in scales less than @xmath428 .",
    "the glast with its angular resolution as good as @xmath429 and detection area by a factor of 10 larger than egret ( see e.g. bloom 1996 ) , is nicely suited for this task .",
    "the fluxes of @xmath0-rays expected above 1 tev in both scenarios 1 and 2 are below the current flux upper limits set by the whipple ( reynolds et al .",
    "1993 ) , hegra ( schmele 1998 ) and casa - mia groups ( see fig .",
    ". however larger fluxes at such high energies can not be excluded . indeed , besides the hard @xmath3-decay @xmath0-ray component due to cr sources which could remain unresolved",
    ", we may expect also higher ic fluxes of @xmath0-rays radiated by a possible second component of ultra high energy electrons with a spectrum extending well beyond 100 tev .",
    "the existence of such a component of electrons is needed within the model which interprets the hard x - radiation of the inner galactic disk as a result of synchrotron radiation of ultra - relativistic electrons .",
    "this hypothesis requires a very large ( up to @xmath430 ) maximum energy of electrons and large magnetic field @xmath431 in order to fit the observed x - ray fluxes , as well as to avoid an overproduction of ic @xmath0-rays at 100 tev .",
    "such large values of both @xmath432 and @xmath388 could be probably explained assuming that this energetic component of electrons is produced at the wind termination shocks of the ensemble of old pulsars / neutron stars in the galactic disk .",
    "the hypothesis of the synchrotron origin of hard diffuse x - radiation of the galactic disk needs further confirmation based on the detailed study of spectral and spatial distribution of hard x - rays by future satellite missions like astro - e and integral , as well as by a detection of the diffuse @xmath0-ray background of the galactic disk at @xmath433 at the flux level rather close to the current casa - mia upper limits .",
