    "recently , much attention has been paid to the investigation of black holes in an asymptotically anti de sitter  ( ads ) spacetime . according to the ads / cft duality  @xcite ,",
    "the gravitational theory in a black hole spacetime is dual to a strongly coupled gauge theory at finite temperature . as a fascinating application of the duality ,",
    "a holographic model of superconductors has been constructed from black hole solutions with charged scalar hair  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that there is a variety of black hole solutions in an asymptotically ads spacetime , which could be useful to understand strongly correlated condensed matter physics .    even in the einstein - maxwell system ,",
    "many black hole solutions with various topologies can be constructed in an asymptotically ads spacetime  @xcite , while a uniqueness theorem has been established for the static black hole solution without charge by restricting the topology to @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the planar reissner - nordstrm ads solution with @xmath1 topology is one of the black hole solutions  @xcite .",
    "it attracts much attention as a holographic model of strongly correlated condensed matter systems because the dual theory lives in a flat 2 + 1 dimensional spacetime .",
    "when we apply the ads / cft duality to condensed matter systems , it is interesting to incorporate the lattice structure into the boundary theory .",
    "as it is typical in condensed matter physics , the lattice structure induces a periodic inhomogeneous electric potential . in the holographic theory ,",
    "such inhomogeneity in the boundary theory corresponds to that of the gauge field in the bulk theory .",
    "so , in this paper , we construct inhomogeneous charged static black hole solutions , by perturbing the planar reissner - nordstrm ads solution , and investigate their geometrical properties .    on the other hand , from the perspective of general relativity ,",
    "one of the issues in the bulk spacetime is whether a naked singularity appears .",
    "according to the ( strong ) cosmic censorship hypothesis  @xcite , any singularity should be hidden inside the event horizon and the geometry can not be extended beyond the cauchy horizon . however , in the case of the reissner - nordstrm ads solution , there exists a region where a naked singularity can be observed behind the regular cauchy horizon . even though the cauchy horizon is unstable against dynamical perturbations due to the infinite blueshift  @xcite",
    ", the possibility to observe a singularity should still remain because the resulting singularity would be a null weak singularity  @xcite . in the context of the ads / cft duality , the hypothesis was also argued in  @xcite .",
    "another issue regarding the cosmic censorship hypothesis is whether the zero temperature black hole solutions can have a regular event horizon . in a class of extremal black holes in string theory",
    ", it has been shown that the event horizon can not be smooth even though the kretschmann scalar curvature invariant @xmath2 is small there  @xcite .",
    "recently , a similar phenomenon was observed in the lifshitz spacetime  @xcite . for the ads black hole solutions with charged scalar hair",
    ", it has been shown that the event horizon can not be regular in the extremal limit  @xcite .",
    "so , the extremal reissner - nordstrm ads solution with a regular event horizon seems to be exceptional .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we will particularly investigate the geometry inside the event horizon of our inhomogeneous charged black hole solutions , both numerically and analytically .",
    "being quite different from the unperturbed reissner - nordstrm ads solution , the kretschmann scalar curvature invariant becomes infinitely large toward the cauchy horizon for any wavelength perturbations . in the extremal case ,",
    "we show that the black hole solutions with long wavelength inhomogeneity can not have a regular event horizon even though the kretschmann scalar curvature invariant is small there .",
    "this is because the tidal force which an observer freely falling into the black hole experiences diverges towards the horizon .",
    "this tidal force is strong in the sense that the shear of any timelike geodesic congruence diverges infinitely .",
    "hence , smooth extension of the geometry beyond the event horizon is impossible .    in the next section ,",
