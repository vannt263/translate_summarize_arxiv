    "due to the usual relation @xmath137 the jj and the resonator are dynamically coupled .",
    "alternatively , the jj part can also be represented in the charge basis as @xmath138 where @xmath139 are eigenstates of the number operator @xmath140 .",
    "the circuit is embedded in fluctuating reservoirs @xmath141 which are assumed to be statistically independent .",
    "@xmath142 describes high frequency electromagnetic modes constituting a conventional low temperature heat bath with ohmic spectral distribution .",
    "@xmath143 captures the low frequency part of the environment which according to the experiment occurs as voltage noise at the jj .",
    "the heat bath interacts bi - linearly with the phase of the resonator via @xmath144 with reservoir force @xmath145 obeying @xmath146 and a second moment fixed by the fluctuation dissipation theorem .",
    "the voltage noise can be seen as a fluctuating component to the bias voltage @xmath147 with @xmath148 and thus couples also to the charge operator via @xmath149 .",
    "the interaction between the circuit and the respective environments is sufficiently weak so that a perturbative treatment according to a born - markov master equation is applicable .",

    "the operator @xmath154 is also conjugate to @xmath70 and , by slight abuse of notation , will thus be denoted as @xmath14 again henceforth .",
