    "the butcher - oemler effect was first reported by butcher & oemler ( 1978 , 1984 ) as an increase in the fraction of blue galaxies ( @xmath3 ) toward higher redshift in 33 galaxy clusters over the redshift range 0@xmath4z@xmath40.54 .",
    "butcher and oemler s work made a strong impact since it showed direct evidence for the evolution of cluster galaxies .",
    "much work regarding the nature of these blue galaxies followed .",
    "rakos & schombert ( 1995 ) found that the fraction of blue galaxies increases from 20% at z=0.4 to 80% at z=0.9 , suggesting that the evolution in clusters is even stronger than previously thought .",
    "margoniner & de carvalho ( 2000 ) studied 48 clusters in the redshift range of 0.03@xmath4z@xmath40.38 and detected a strong butcher - oemler effect consistent with that of rakos & schombert ( 1995 ) . despite the trend with redshift ,",
    "almost all previous work has reported a wide range of blue fraction values .",
    "in particular , in a large sample of 295 abell clusters , margoniner et al .",
    "( 2001 ) not only confirmed the existence of the butcher - oemler effect , but also found the blue fraction depends on cluster richness .",
    "although the detection of the butcher - oemler effect has been claimed in various studies , there have been some suggestions of strong selection biases in the cluster samples .",
    "newberry , kirshner & boroson ( 1988 ) measured velocity dispersions and surface densities of galaxies in clusters and found a marked difference between local clusters and intermediate redshift clusters .",
    "more recently , andreon & ettori ( 1999 ) measured x - ray surface brightness profiles , sizes , and luminosities of the butcher - oemler sample of clusters and concluded that the sample is not uniform . the selection bias ,",
    "thus , could mimic evolutionary effects .",
    "smail et al .",
    "( 1998 ) used 10 x - ray bright clusters in the redshift range of 0.22@xmath0z@xmath00.28 and found that the clusters have only a small fraction of blue galaxies .",
    "the butcher - oemler effect was not observed with their sample .",
    "similarly , galaxies in radio selected groups are not significantly bluer at higher redshifts ( allington - smith et al .",
    "garilli et al .",
    "( 1996 ) observed 67 abell and x - ray selected clusters and found no detectable butcher - oemler effect until z=0.2 .",
    "fairley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) studied eight x - ray selected galaxy clusters and found no correlation of blue fraction with redshift .",
    "rakos & schombert ( 1995 ) s sample were selected from the catalog compiled by gunn , hoessel & oke ( 1986 ) using photographic plates taken only in two color bands .",
    "the sample thus have a possible bias against red , high redshift clusters .",
    "in addition to the possible sample selection biases , with the exception of margoniner et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the number of clusters in the previous works was small , consisting of a few to dozens of clusters .",
    "therefore the statistical uncertainty was large .",
    "many authors also noted that cluster - to - cluster variation of the fraction of blue galaxies is considerable .",
    "the need for a larger , more uniform sample of clusters has been evident .    there have been various attempts to find another physical mechanism causing the large scatter which has been seen in almost all previous work .",
    "wang & ulmer ( 1997 ) claimed the existence of a correlation between the blue fraction and the ellipticity of the cluster x - ray emissions in their sample of clusters at 0.15@xmath0z@xmath00.6 .",
    "metevier , romer & ulmer ( 2000 ) showed that two clusters with a bimodal x - ray surface brightness profile have an unusually high blue fraction value and thus do not follow the typical butcher - oemler relation .",
    "they claimed that the butcher - oemler effect is an environmental phenomenon as well as an evolutionary phenomenon .",
    "margoniner et al . (",
    "2001 ) found a richness dependence in the sense that richer clusters have smaller blue fractions .",
    "they claimed that this richness dependence causes a large scatter in the blue fraction  redshift diagram .",
    "therefore , it is of extreme interest to explore an origin of the scatter in the blue fraction despite the redshift trend .    at the same time , various studies using morphological information have reported a similar evolution effect in cluster galaxies .",
    "dressler et al . ( 1997 ) studied 10 clusters at 0.37@xmath4z@xmath40.56 and found a steep increase in the s0 fraction toward @xmath5 redshift , compared to nearby clusters studied earlier ( dressler 1980 ) .",
    "couch et al .",
    "( 1994,1998 ) studied three clusters at z=0.31 and found their s0 fraction to be consistent with the trend observed by dressler et al .",
    "fasano et al .",
    "( 2000 ) observed nine clusters at intermediate redshifts ( 0.09@xmath4z@xmath40.26 ) and also found an increase in the s0 fraction toward lower redshift .",
    "it has been proposed that the increase in the s0 fraction is caused by the transformation of spiral galaxies into s0 galaxies through a process yet unknown .",
    "these studies , however , need to be pursued further , considering that most of the previous work was based on morphological galaxy classification by eye .",
    "although it is an excellent tool to classify galaxies , manual classification could potentially have unknown biases .",
    "( a detailed comparison of human classifiers can be found in lahav et al .",
    "a machine based , automated classification would better control biases and would allow a reliable determination of the completeness and false positive rate .",
    "a further reason to investigate the evolution of cluster galaxies is the sample size .",
    "the morphological fraction studies of clusters reported so far are based on only dozens of clusters .",
    "furthermore , the clusters themselves have intrinsic variety in the fraction of blue / spiral galaxies as reported by various butcher - oemler and morphological analyses listed above . since several authors have suggested that the fraction of blue galaxies depends on cluster richness , it is important to use a uniform cluster sample , preferably selected by an automated method with a well known selection function .",
    "various theoretical models have been proposed to explain the butcher - oemler effect and the increase of the s0 fraction .",
    "these models include ram pressure stripping of gas ( spitzer & baade 1951 , gunn & gott 1972 , farouki & shapiro 1980 ; kent 1981 , fujita 1998 ; abadi , moore & bower 1999 , fujita & nagashima 1999 , quilis , moore & bower 2000 ) , galaxy infall ( bothun & dressler 1986 , abraham et al .",
    "1996a , ellingson et al .",
    "2001 ) , galaxy harassment ( moore et al . 1996 , 1999 ) , cluster tidal forces ( byrd & valtonen 1990 , valluri 1993 ) , enhanced star formation ( dressler & gunn 1992 ) , and removal and consumption of the gas ( larson , tinsley & caldwell 1980 , balogh et al . 2001 , bekki et al . 2002 ) .",
    "it is , however , yet unknown exactly what processes play major roles in changing the color and morphology of cluster galaxies . to derive a clear model explaining the evolution of cluster galaxies ,",
    "it is important to clarify both the butcher - oemler effect and the s0 increase , using a large and uniform cluster sample in conjunction with a machine based morphological classification .    with the advent of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) , which is an imaging and spectroscopic survey of 10,000 deg@xmath6 of the sky , we now have the opportunity to overcome these limitations .",
    "the sdss cut & enhance galaxy cluster catalog ( goto et al .",
    "2002a ) provides a large uniform cluster catalog with a well defined selection function . the ccd - based , accurate photometry of the sdss ( fukugita et al .",
    "1996 , hogg et al . 2002 , smith et al . 2002 ) and the wide coverage of the sdss on the sky allow accurate estimation of blue fraction with robust local background subtraction . although the sdss is a ground based observation , the state - of - the - art reduction software and the accuracy of ccd data make it possible to derive morphological classification in an automated way ( lupton et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) . by using the sdss data set , we are able to study one of the largest samples to date  514 clusters  to the depth of @xmath7=-19.44 ( @xmath8=0.75 ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is as follows .",
    "we aim to confirm or disprove the existence of the butcher - oemler effect using one of the largest , most uniform cluster samples . at the same time",
    ", we hope to shed light on the morphological properties of the butcher - oemler galaxies using morphological parameters derived from the sdss data .",
    "finally we investigate the origin of the scatter in the galaxy type fraction versus redshift relation , in hope of gaining some understanding about the physical processes responsible for the scatter .",
    "since several people reported that field galaxies also evolve both morphologically ( schade et al .",

    "1998 ; cowie et al . 1999 ; sullivan et al .",
    "2000 ; wilson et al .",
    "2002 ) , it is of extreme importance to compare the evolution of cluster galaxies with that of field galaxies to specify a responsible physical mechanism .",
    "it is possible that the butcher - oemler effect and morphological transition of cluster galaxies are more commonly happening including the field region of the universe , thus a cluster specific mechanism is not responsible for the evolution of galaxies .",
    "however , since the sdss spectroscopic data are not deep enough to probe cosmologically interesting time scale , we leave it to future work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe the sdss data and the cut & enhance cluster catalog . in section 3 , we analyze the late type fraction , both spectrally and morphologically . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the possible caveats and underlying physical processes in the evolution of galaxies . in section 5 ,",

    "we correct the data for galactic extinction determined from the maps given by schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "we include galaxies to @xmath18=21.5 ( petrosian magnitude ) , which is the star / galaxy separation limit ( studied in detail by scranton et al .",
    "2002 ) in the sdss data .",
    "the galaxy cluster catalog used here is a subset of the sdss cut & enhance galaxy cluster catalog ( goto et al .",
    "there are 4638 clusters in the equatorial region ( see kim et al .",
    "2002 , annis et al . 2002 , bahcall et al .",
    "2002 and miller et al .",
    "2002 for other works on the sdss galaxy clusters ) . besides the uniformity of the catalog with its",
    "well defined selection function , the catalog has very good photometric redshifts , @xmath19=0.015 at @xmath200.3 , which enables us to use a large sample of clusters ( goto et al .",
    "2002a ; see also gal et al .",
    "2000 and annis et al .",
    "2002 for photometric redshift methods for clusters ) .",
    "we use clusters in the redshift range of 0.02@xmath0z@xmath00.3 and galaxies brighter than @xmath21 , which corresponds to @xmath18=21.5 at z=0.3 . since several authors in previous work claimed that biases in sample cluster selection can mimic the evolutionary effect , it is important to control cluster richness well .",
    "we use clusters with more than 25 member galaxies between @xmath22 and @xmath21 within 0.7 mpc after fore / background subtraction , as explained in the next section .",
    "the large areal coverage of the sdss data enables us to subtract the fore / background counts reliably .",
    "we can thus control the richness of the sample clusters well .",
    "the criteria leave 514 clusters in the region .",
    "we stress the importance of the uniformity of the cluster catalog .",
    "although the abell cluster catalog ( abell 1958 , abell , corwin and olowin 1989 ) has been used in many studies , it was constructed by eye , and is sensitive to projection effects . when comparing clusters at different redshifts , it is particularly important to ensure that the data quality and cluster selection techniques are comparable , to avoid the introduction of potential selection biases .",
    "the sdss cut & enhance cluster catalog used here is constructed using only the data taken with the sdss telescope .",
    "also , clusters are detected using a single algorithm ( ce ) throughout the entire redshift range ( 0.02@xmath0z@xmath00.3 ) .",
    "combined with the well controlled richness criteria , our cluster sample is not only one of the biggest but also one of the most statistically uniform cluster catalogs . to study colors of galaxies in clusters , it is also important to use a cluster catalog created without targeting the red sequence of color magnitude relation of cluster galaxies .",
    "for example , gladders & yee(2000 ) and annis et al .",
    "( 2002 ) use a color filter targeting the red sequence of clusters and find galaxy clusters efficiently without suffering from projection effects .",
    "these techniques , however , can potentially have biases with regards to the colors of detected galaxy clusters , since clusters with a strong red sequence is more easily detected .",
    "they may not , therefore , be ideally suited to a butcher - oemler type of analysis .",
    "in contrast , the sdss cut & enhance cluster catalog does not pick red galaxies selectively , and is therefore more suitable for this study .",
    "( note that the the cut & enhance method does use generous color cuts .",
    "although the color cut is designed to be wide enough to include blue galaxies in clusters , therefore it is not completely free from color originated biases . ) in previous work , clusters have often been detected using data from only one or two color bands .",
    "this can introduce a bias , since higher redshift clusters are redder and fainter than lower redshift clusters .",
    "the sdss cut & enhance cluster catalog detects clusters using four bands of the sdss data ( @xmath23 and @xmath15 ) , which minimizes the bias against redshift .",
    "we compute fractions of late - type galaxies in four different ways .",
    "first , we describe the statistical fore / background subtraction method we use . in counting galaxies ,",
    "all galaxies are assumed to be at the cluster redshift to calculate absolute magnitudes .",
    "then galaxies only between @xmath22 and @xmath24 are used in the analysis .",
    "we count the number of late - type / total galaxies within 0.7 mpc from each cluster .",
    "valotto et al .",
    "( 2001 ) claimed that the global background correction can not correct background contamination appropriately .",
    "following the claim , we use a local background correction .",
    "the number of late - type / total galaxies in fore / background is estimated using an annular area around each cluster with an inner radius of 2.1 mpc and an outer radius of 2.21 mpc in the same absolute magnitude range .",
    "the annulus fore / background subtraction enables us to estimate the fore / background locally , minimizing variations in galaxy number counts due to the large scale structure .",
    "when an outer annulus touches the boundary of the region , a fore / background count is globally subtracted using galaxy number counts in the entire 400 deg@xmath6 region by adjusting it to the angular area each cluster subtends .",
    "this fore / background subtraction is used in the analyses described in sections 3.2 - 3.5 .",
    "the fraction of blue / late - type galaxies and its error are computed according to the following equations .",
    "@xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 represent numbers of blue / late - type galaxies in a cluster region and a field region , respectively . @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent numbers of all galaxies in a cluster region and a field region , respectively .",
    "the equation ( [ frac_err ] ) assumes that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are not independent .",
    "we explain the derivation of equation ( [ frac_err ] ) in appendix [ error ] .",
    "the blue fraction of galaxy clusters ( @xmath3 ) is measured as the fraction of galaxies bluer in @xmath1 rest frame color than the color of the ridge line of the cluster by 0.2 mag .",
    "this color criterion is equivalent to butcher & oemler s ( 1984 ) 0.2 mag in @xmath33 and margoniner et al.s ( 2000 , 2001 ) 0.2 mag in @xmath1 .",

    "we emphasize that the galaxy classification used here is purely morphological  independent of colors of galaxies .",
    "the fact that we still see the increase of the late type galaxies toward higher redshift suggests that these butcher - oemler type blue galaxies also change their morphological appearance as well as their colors .",

    "figure [ fig : okamura_rich ] , however , still shows a significant amount of scatter , which might be suggesting the existence of another factor in determining the blue fraction in addition to redshift and richness .",
    "the dependence of the late type fraction on cluster richness , however , provides another hint on the underlying physical processes .",
    "since ram pressure is stronger in clusters with higher temperature at the same gas density , fujita & nagashima(1999 ) theoretically predicted that if ram pressure is the only mechanism responsible for the evolution of galaxies in clusters , the fraction of blue galaxies will always be higher in lower x - ray luminosity clusters , which usually have low temperatures .",
    "our data shown in figure [ fig : okamura_rich ] are consistent with the prediction from their ram pressure stripping model .",
    "although our richness is from numbers of galaxies in optical imaging data , it is reasonable to assume it correlates well with x - ray luminosity ( bahcall 1977 ; bower et al .",
    "then , the optical richness can be related to the gas temperature through the well known @xmath74 relation ( mitchell , ives , and culhane 1977 ; henry & arnaud 1991 ; edge & stewart 1991 ; david et al .",

    "the @xmath74 relation studied by xue & wu ( 2000 ) is @xmath79 .",

    "1994 , and miller et al . in preparation ) , figure [ fig : okamura_rich ] provides another hint that ram pressure stripping induces the evolution of cluster galaxies .    in the literature",
    ", however , the dependence of blue fractions on cluster richness has been controversial .",
    "bahcall ( 1977 ) studied 14 x - ray clusters and found that the fraction of spiral galaxies decreases with increasing x - ray luminosity .",
    "lea & henry(1988 ) observed 14 clusters in x - ray and found that the percentage of blue objects in the clusters seems to increase with the x - ray luminosity .",
    "on the other hand , fairley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) studied eight x - ray selected clusters and did not find any dependence of blue fractions on x - ray luminosities .",
    "balogh et al . ( 2002 ) studied 10 clusters at z=0.25 with low x - ray luminosity and found similar morphological and spectral properties of galaxies compared with clusters with high x - ray luminosity ( balogh et al .",
    "1997 ) . in all cases ,",
    "the results were based on a small sample of clusters .",
    "we also point out that although our results are consistent with a ram - pressure stripping model , there is a possibility that the other mechanisms could explain the phenomena . for example , richer clusters might have higher rate of merger / interaction due to their higher galaxy density .",
    "the same argument holds true for galaxy harassment .",
    "thus , more study is needed to conclude about the physical mechanism causing the phenomena . in the near future , confirming the richness dependence using x - ray luminosities or velocity dispersions with a larger sample of clusters would offer us more insight on the subject .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the fraction of late type galaxies in four different ways using one of the largest , most uniform samples of 514 clusters between 0.02@xmath0z@xmath00.3 from the sdss cut & enhance galaxy cluster catalog .",
    "all the clusters selected here have more than 25 member galaxies within 0.7 mpc and between @xmath53 and @xmath21 after statistical local fore / background subtraction . the following four different ways to estimate the fractions of late type galaxies",
    "are adopted : restframe @xmath1 color ( a classical butcher - oemler estimator ) , @xmath2 color , concentration index and de vaucouleur / exponential profile fit .",
    "the last three parameters are known to correlate well with galaxy morphologies ( shimasaku et al .",
    "2001 , strateva et al .",
    "2001 ) . in all four cases ,",
    "we observe an increase of the fraction of late type galaxies toward higher redshift with a significance of more than 99.99% ( table [ tab : correlation ] ) .",
    "we draw the following conclusion from this work .",
    "we confirm the presence of the butcher - oemler effect using @xmath1 color .",
    "the butcher - oemler effect is real and exists in our sample clusters as seen in the lower left panel of figure [ fig : bo ] .",
    "the slope of the increase is consistent with previous work although the scatter in the blue fraction is considerable .",
    "previous work also noted a large scatter in the fraction of blue galaxies .",
    "the fraction of late type galaxies also shows a similar increase when we use a @xmath2 color cut .",
    "we observe a morphological butcher - oemler effect as an increase of late type galaxies toward higher redshift , using pure morphological parameters such as a concentration parameter and de vaucouleur / exponential profile fit .",
    "the rates of increase are consistent with previous work on the spiral to s0 transition , albeit with considerable scatter ( figure [ fig : bo ] ) .",
    "the increase is also in agreement with the original butcher - oemler effect from @xmath1 color .",
    "our results are consistent with the evolutionary scenario proposed by dressler et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , smail et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , couch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and kodama & smail ( 2002 ) , in which there is a progressive morphological conversion in clusters from spirals into e / s0 s .",
    "we find a slight tendency for richer clusters to have lower values of the late type fraction ( figure [ fig : okamura_rich ] ) .",
    "this trend agrees with the ram pressure stripping model proposed by bahcall ( 1977 ) and fujita et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , in which galaxies in richer clusters are more affected by ram pressure due to their high temperature .",
    "although our results 1,2 , and 3 are all consistent with a ram - pressure stripping model , there still remains a possibility that other physical mechanisms are responsible for the evolution of cluster galaxies .",
    "thus , further study is needed both theoretically and observationally to reveal the underlying physical mechanism responsible for the evolution of cluster galaxies . since this work",
    "is based on only 5% of the whole sdss data , an increase in the data will improve the statistical accuracy as the sdss proceeds . extending the work to higher redshifts using 4 - 8",

    "in section [ method ] , we used a fixed 0.7 mpc radius to measure blue / spiral fractions among cluster galaxies since it was difficult to measure virial radius for relatively poor clusters in our sample from the sdss imaging data .",
    "however it is known that virial radius changes according to cluster richness ; i.e. richer clusters have larger virial radius than poorer clusters .",
    "therefore using a fixed radius could bring some bias associated with cluster richness . in this section",
    "we try to rectify this problem using cluster richness to calculate virial radius under a simple assumption .",
    "we assume that our cluster richness ( number of galaxies between @xmath22 and @xmath21 within 0.7 mpc after fore / background subtraction ) is proportional to volume of a cluster , and therefore proportional to @xmath81 . since richness is a relatively easy parameter to measure from the imaging data , we use the following equation to calculate radius for each cluster .    @xmath82    where median richness of our sample cluster is 32 .",
    "the coefficient of the equation is adjusted so that median clusters in our sample have radius of 0.7 mpc , which corresponds to the mean radius used in butcher et al .",

    "the distribution of radius calculated in this way is presented in figure [ fig : new_rad ] .",
    "as expected it has a peak at 0.7 mpc . using this varying radius , we re - calculated all figures in section [ method ] .",
    "sample clusters are still required to have more than 25 galaxies after fore / background subtraction within the new radius .",
    "therefore the number of sample clusters are somewhat reduced to 413 clusters .",
    "results are presented in figures [ fig : bo_new]-[fig : okamura_elong_new ] .",
    "reassuringly , all figures have the same trend as presented in section [ method ] .",
    "therefore the discussion in section [ discussion ] still holds .",
    "although it is ideal to use virial radius to measure blue / spiral fractions of clusters , we regard that our analysis using fixed 0.7 mpc radius is not hampered to the extend where our main conclusions change .",
    "in this section we summarize how we derived eq .",
    "( [ frac_err ] ) to calculate errors on blue / late type fractions . as a starting point , we assume the following",
    ".    * number of galaxies in a cluster region ( @xmath29 ) follows poisson statistics . *",

    "+ @xmath86 and @xmath87 satisfy the following relations .",
    "+ @xmath89=0 , @xmath90=@xmath91 , and if a and b are independent , @xmath92=0 .",
    "note that the equation [ frac_err ] is not a deviation of a single sample but the expectation value estimated from the sample , and should be written as @xmath93 if we write rigidly .      since @xmath29 and @xmath30 follow poisson statistics , and they are independent .",
    "@xmath102 similarly , when @xmath29 follows poisson statistics , @xmath27 also follows poisson statistics since @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , @xmath104 deriving the cross term at the end of the equation is not so straightforward . the cross term is expanded as @xmath105@xmath106@xmath107@xmath108                  however this is not the only way to estimate the error . actually , the correlation between @xmath28 and @xmath30 is not so obvious since late type fraction in the field and that in the cluster region might be different .",
