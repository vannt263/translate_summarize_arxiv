    "the observed data of the neutrino oscillations @xcite have been accumulated to suggest the allowed range of the cp - violating dirac phase @xmath7 near @xmath8 inducing the maximal cp violation and that of the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle @xmath9 near 45@xmath10 indicating the maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing @xcite . these maximal effects arouse theoretical interest that both the dirac cp - violation and the atmospheric neutrino mixing are necessarily maximal because of a certain constraints imposed on flavor neutrino masses .",

    "we have demonstrated the usefulness of flavor neutrino masses expressed in terms of @xmath1 .",
    "appropriate constraints on @xmath1 reveal the necessary mutual dependence among @xmath0 to have the maximal cp violation .",

    "it can also be discussed how @xmath29 of eq.([eq : m_nu for maximalcp-23 ] ) is modified by the inclusion of the effect from @xmath126 allowing an arbitrary atmospheric mixing angle .",
    "for example , at a first glance , we may choose the constraint of @xmath127=real leading eq.([eq : m_nu for maximalcp-23 ] ) for the maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing .",
    "this subject will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the general form of @xmath32 contains seven phases : three phases of the dirac type to be denoted by @xmath103 , @xmath92 and @xmath94 , three phases of the majorana type to be denoted by @xmath128 and the remaining phase to be denoted by @xmath93 @xcite . for @xmath129 ,",

    "the global phase @xmath92 in eqs.([eq : maximalmnu for pmns-2 ] ) and ( [ eq : newpmns for maximalcp ] ) are cancelled each other in @xmath144 .    to reach @xmath88 in eq.([eq : general upmns ] ) , it is further required that eq.([eq : naturalchoice ] ) be satisfied ; namely , @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "this choice subsequently requires that @xmath147real ( as indicated by eq.([eq : mainrelationsmass ] ) ) , which is nothing but the additional constraint imposed in refs .. the resulting @xmath32 of eq.([eq : upmnsvsupd ] ) turns out to be : @xmath148 the obtained @xmath32 is literally coincident with @xmath88 of eq.([eq : general upmns ] ) for @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "it is thus proved that the texture for @xmath88 can be derived from the texture for @xmath135 .",
    "no majorana cp violation is induced because of @xmath145 and @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "one may wonder if the texture of eq.([eq : m_nu for maximalcp-23 - 2 ] ) with @xmath89 and @xmath90 is obtained from eq.([eq : maximalmnu for pmns ] ) for the texture with @xmath85 and @xmath86 by adjusting the redundant phases . requiring that @xmath152 realized by @xmath153 , we reach @xmath154 indicating @xmath155 , which can not be equivalent to @xmath89 . the texture with @xmath89 and @xmath90 is not connected to eq.([eq : maximalmnu for pmns ] ) ."
