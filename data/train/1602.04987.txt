    "co - nonsolvency ( insolubility of polymer in a mixture of two good solvents ) is one of the most intriguing phenomena in physical chemistry of polymers . despite the great efforts in both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite investigations in understanding the co - nonsolvency ,",
    "the mechanism of this phenomenon remains unclear untill now @xcite .",
    "basing on the results of the experimental researches devoted to a behavior of the single pnipam polymer chain @xcite as well as a behavior of pnipam hydrogels @xcite , tanaka et al .",
    "@xcite formulated a quasi - chemical model of a single pnipam chain in a mixed water - methanol solvent .",
    "authors showed that the co - nonsolvency occurs due to a competition of water and methanol molecules for hydrogen bonding with polymer backbone .",
    "thus , it seemed to be that the co - nonsolvency is caused by the hydrogen bonding between the solvent molecules and monomers .",
    "however , in recent papers of mukherji et al .",
    "@xcite by using md computer simulations of lennard - jones polymer chain dissolved in two - component lennard - jones mixed solvent was shown that co - nonsolvency can take place even in the polymer solutions without hydrogen bonding , but it may be driven by the universal van - der - waals and excluded volume interactions only .",
    "authors established that a microscopic parameter which mainly determines an availability of the co - nonsolvency is a difference between energetic parameters of polymer - co - solvent and polymer - solvent attraction , i.e. , @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , they showed that at the sufficiently large value of this difference ( or sufficiently low temperature ) the coil - globule transition occurs as a first - order phase transition @xcite .",
    "thus , one can conclude that the co - nonsolvency is a generic physical phenomenon which can be caused by only universal van - der - waals and excluded volume interactions between molecules of solvent species and monomers @xcite .",
    "the avalability of co - nonsolvency in the mixture n , n dimethylformamide / cyclohexane / polystyrene additionally indicates on the correctness of the latter conclusion @xcite .",
    "mukherji et al . interpreted results of their md simulation by using a simple analytical lattice adsorption model @xcite , taking into account so - called bridging mechanism which implies that one co - solvent molecule can be strongly associated with two monomers . in other words , from authors point of view the co - nonsolvency usually occurs due to an association of co - solvent molecules with the polymer backbone .",
    "it should be noted that within such interpretation bridging-induced coil - globule transition is similar to the electrostatically driven coil - globule transition in polyelectrolyte solutions @xcite .",
    "recently , basing on the full atomistic md simulation of the pnipam chain in mixed water - methanol solvent , thorough analysis of entropy and enthalpy contributions to the solvation free energy at the level of linear response approximation for the frozen coil and globule states of polymer chain was provided @xcite .",
    "authors showed that in the region of co - nonsolvency , when a collapse of polymer coil takes place the energetics of electrostatic , hydrogen bonding , or bridging - type interactions with the globule is found to play no role .",
    "instead , preferential methanol binding results in a significant increase of the globule configurational entropy , stabilizing methanol - enriched globular structures over wet globular structures in neat water @xcite .",
    "thus , there is an ambiguity in the interpretation of the co - nonsolvency microscopic mechanism .",
    "however , the main goal of this paper is not to consider the microscopic mechanism of the co - nonsolvency , but to understand its thermodynamic nature more deeply . to reach our goal",
    ", we calculate the solvation free energy of the polymer chain as well as its enthalpic and entropic contributions as the functions of mixed solvent composition in a region of co - nonsolvency . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this problem has not been considered from the first principles of the statistical thermodynamics till now . in order to consider the above - mentioned problem we develop the off - lattice statistical model of the single polymer chain in mixed binary solvent .",
    "taking into account the conformational entropy of polymer chain and renormalization of the co - solvent mole fraction near the polymer backbone , we show that the co - nonsolvency can be successfully described within our self - consistent field theory .",
    "we show that , when the collapse of polymer chain takes place , the entropy and enthalpy contributions to the solvation free energy of globule strongly grow , almost compensating each other . thus we obtain that from thermodynamic point of view the co - nonsolvency is the essentially enthalpic - entropic effect and caused by so - called enthalpy - entropy compensation @xcite . we also show that at sufficiently high temperature a reentrant coil - to - globule - to - coil transition proceeds smoothly . on the contrary ,",
    "when the temperature drops below a certain threshold value , the coil - globule transition occurs in the regime of first - order phase transition , i.e. , discontinuous changes of the radius of gyration and the local co - solvent mole fraction that confirms earlier results of md simulations @xcite .",
    "we calculate the solution heat capacity change due to the solvation of polymer chain as a function of the temperature and show that it is in qualitative agreement with the experimental differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc ) data for pnipam in aqueous methanol @xcite .",
    "we consider an isolated polymer chain with a degree of polymerization @xmath1 immersed in a low - molecular weight two - component solvent at a specified number density @xmath2 and temperature @xmath3 that are located at fluid state region .",
    "so the polymer chain in our model is dissolved in a mixture of solvent and co - solvent which are good ones for the polymer chain .",
    "thus , a co - solvent concentration in the bulk solution is @xmath4 , while a solvent concentration is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a co - solvent mole fraction in the bulk . like in recent works @xcite we assume for convenience that the volume of system consists of two parts : the gyration volume @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is a radius of gyration of the polymer chain ) containing predominantly monomers of the polymer chain and the bulk solution . to exclude from the consideration a number density change ( that can take place near the polymer chain @xcite ) which unimportant for this research , we assume that the entire polymer solution is incompressible , so that the solvent number density in the gyration volume can be determined by the relation @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a monomer number density . moreover",
    ", we introduce a local co - solvent mole fraction @xmath11 by the relations @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the local number densities of the solvent and co - solvent in the gyration volume , respectively .",
    "we also assume that the pair interaction potentials for monomer - monomer , monomer - solvent , monomer - co - solvent , solvent - solvent , co - solvent - co - solvent , and solvent - co - solvent have a following form @xmath16 where @xmath17 ; @xmath18 ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 are effective diameters and energetic parameters , respectively . as well as in our previous work @xcite , we assume that @xmath21 , whereas each energetic parameter @xmath20 is considered as independent . within the present study we do not introduce the second virial coefficients as the parameters of interaction @xcite , but as in the work @xcite we construct the total free energy by using different expressions which are straightforwardly related to repulsive and attractive parts of interaction potentials ( [ eq : pot ] ) .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the works @xcite we take into account the both solvent species explicitly",
    ".    a conditional solvation free energy of the polymer chain can be written as : @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath8 is the radius of gyration of the polymer chain , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are molecule numbers of the solvent and co - solvent in the gyration volume , respectively ; @xmath26 is the ideal free energy of the polymer chain and mixed solvent which can be calculated in the following way @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the expansion factor , @xmath30 is the mean - square radius of gyration of the ideal gaussian polymer chain , @xmath31 is the kuhn length of the segment , @xmath32 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath3 is the absolute temperature , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the de broglie wavelengths of the solvent species .",
    "the first term in ( [ eq : fid ] ) is the free energy of the ideal gaussian polymer chain within the fixman approximation @xcite ; @xmath35 is a pressure in the bulk solution which will be determined below .",
    "the excess free energy of polymer solution takes the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a contribution of the repulsive interactions in the gyration volume due to the excluded volume of the monomers and molecules of solvent species which we determine through the mansoori - carnahan - starling - leland equation of state for the hard - spheres mixture ( see supporting information ) @xcite .",
    "the use of the latter equation of state instead the virial equation of state @xcite allows us to take into account more precisely the packing effects at the large density of solution @xmath2 . the contribution of attractive interactions @xmath38 we determine within the standard mean - field approximation as follows @xmath39 where the interaction parameters @xmath40 can be determined by the standard rule : @xmath41 where the van - der - waals volumes @xmath42 are introduced ; @xmath17 .",
    "we determine the equilibrium values of the expansion factor @xmath43 and of the local co - solvent mole fraction @xmath11 by the minimization of solvation free energy @xmath44 ( see supporting information ) .",
    "it is worth noting that for the practical calculations the local co - solvent mole fraction @xmath11 may be related to the excess coordination number of co - solvent @xmath45 which is usually used to quantify the stability of given polymer state and describe the preferential binding of co - solvent _ vs. _ solvent to the polymer surface in real polymer solutions @xcite .",
    "turning to the numerical calculations , we introduce the dimensionless parameters : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 . following the papers of mukherji et al .",
    "@xcite , we use the effective diameters of species : @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "the latter choice approximately corresponds to the pnipam chain dissolved in the water - methanol mixed solvent . to get the co - nonsolvency regime ,",
    "is needed to take the polymer - co - solvent energetic parameter larger than other ones .",
    "thus , we choose the following values of the energetic parameters : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , so that @xmath55 .",
    "we also assume that the degree of polymerization of the polymer chain @xmath56 .",
    "figures 1(a , b ) illustrate the dependences of expansion factor @xmath43 and co - solvent mole fraction @xmath11 in the gyration volume on the bulk co - solvent mole fraction @xmath6 at the different values of temperature @xmath57 under the fixed pressure @xmath58 . as is seen , at sufficiently high temperature at increasing co - solvent mole fraction",
    "@xmath6 the reentrant coil - to - globule - to - coil transition proceeds smoothly , while the co - solvent mole fraction @xmath11 in the gyration volume monotonically increases .",
    "however , when the temperature drops below a certain threshold value , the polymer chain undergoes the coil - globule transition in a regime of first - order phase transition .",
    "namely , when the discontinuous decrease in the expansion factor takes place , the local mole fraction of co - solvent in the gyration volume simultaneously abruptly increases . at further increase in the mole fraction of co - solvent in the bulk solution , the expansion factor and the mole fraction of co - solvent in the gyration volume",
    "smoothly increase .",
    "it is worth noting that increase in the temperature leads to the shift of threshold co - solvent mole fraction at which the coil - globule transition takes place to higher values .",
    "this trend qualitatively agrees with the results of the both experiment and md computer simulation @xcite .",
    "we would also like to stress that an availability of the region where the increase in bulk co - solvent mole fraction has only minor effect on the local solvent / co - solvent composition is a natural consequence of the co - solvent molecules preferential binding with the polymer backbone . indeed , in the case of strong attractive interactions between polymer and co - solvent , the co - solvent - induced coil - globule transition accompanied by the significant increase of the co - solvent concentration within the polymer volume @xcite .",
    "so when the polymer chain adopts a compact globular conformation , further increase in the bulk co - solvent mole fraction should lead to only minor increase in the local co - solvent concentration due to the excluded volume effects .",
    "moreover , the above - mentioned behavior of the local co - solvent mole fraction is in qualitative agreement with the results of md simulations of conformation transition of pnipam hydrogel as a function of the methanol mole fraction in water / methanol mixtures @xcite .",
    "as already pointed out above , the abrupt increase in the local co - solvent mole fraction additionally confirms the results of works @xcite that in the case of strong polymer - co - solvent attraction the co - solvent molecules must be enriched in the globule .",
    "nevertheless , an implicit accounting for the solvent molecules does not allow us to obtain the reentrant coil - to - globule - to - coil transition , but only co - solvent induced coil - globule transition @xcite . in our opinion , it may be related to the fact that implicit solvent models do not take into account the preferential binding co - solvent _ vs _ solvent to the polymer chain which , it seems , should play a crucial role in the co - nonosolvency .",
    "moreover , presence of the abrupt decrease in expansion factor predicted by present theory confirms the earlier md simulations results @xcite . finally before we pass to the discussion of thermodynamic aspects of the co - nonsolvency , it is instructive to discuss how the difference between the energetic parameters of attraction polymer - co - solvent and polymer - solvent @xmath59 influences on the coil - to - globule - to - coil transition .",
    "we obtain ( see fig.2 ) that increase in the difference @xmath59 leads to more pronounced coil - to - globule - to - coil transition that also confirms the recent md simulations results @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that increase in the degree of polymerization @xmath1 also leads to more pronounced the coil - to - globule - to - coil transition .    in order to understand a thermodynamic nature of co - nonsolvency",
    ", we discuss a behavior of entropic and enthalpic contributions to the solvation free energy of the polymer chain in the region where the reentrant coil - to - globule - to - coil transition takes place .",
    "we shall discuss below the solvation free energy per monomer @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are entropy and enthalpy of solvation per monomer , respectively .",
    "on the figures 3a , b are depicted the dependences of solvation entropy and solvation enthalpy on the co - solvent mole fraction at the fixed temperatures @xmath63 ( fig .",
    "3a ) and @xmath64 ( fig .",
    "3b ) and the pressure @xmath58 at a region of co - nonsolvency . as is seen , enthalpy @xmath65 and entropy @xmath66 contributions are strongly oscillating functions of the co - solvent mole fraction @xmath6 within the region of co - nonsolvency in both presented cases . for instance , when the co - solvent mole fraction increases , the solvation enthalpy @xmath65 at first monotonically decreases , attains a minimum , abruptly increases to a maximum , and further monotonically decreases .",
    "the entropy contribution @xmath67 behaves analogously .",
    "it should be noted that an abrupt increase ( decrease ) of the enthalpy ( entropy ) contribution corresponds to the coil - globule transition , occuring in the regime of first - order phase transition .",
    "in contrast to the enthalpy and entropy of solvation , the free energy of solvation in the co - nonsolvency region close to zero .",
    "the latter means that entropy and enthalpy contributions almost compensate each other .",
    "thus the co - nonsolvency has to be considered as complex thermodynamic process driven by entropy - enthalpy compensation that confirms the speculations presented in works @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to discuss the change of solution heat capacity @xmath68 due to the polymer chain solvation as a function of the temperature at different solvent composition @xmath6 in the co - nonsolvency region .",
    "we obtain ( see fig.4 ) that each curve @xmath69 has pronounced minimum which decreases with increase in the bulk co - solvent mole fraction @xmath6 .",
    "such behavior of @xmath70 is in qualitative agreement with the experimental data on the heat flow of pnipam in aqueous methanol obtained by differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc ) method @xcite .",
    "taking into account the effects of conformational entropy , renormalizing the solvent composition near the polymer backbone , and universal intermolecular excluded volume and van - der - waals interactions within the self - consistent field theory , we have described the reentrant coil - to - globule - to - coil transition of polymer chain in mixture of the good solvents .",
    "we show that , when the collapse of polymer chain takes place , the entropy and enthalpy contributions to the solvation free energy of globule strongly grow almost compensating each other . from the first principles of statistical thermodynamics we confirm earlier speculations based on the md simulations results that the co - nonsolvency is the essentially enthalpic - entropic effect and caused by enthalpy - entropy compensation .",
    "however , we would like to discuss the limitations of the present self - consistent field theory .",
    "first , in this work we use the unrealistic potentials of interaction between the particles of solution . in order to apply this theory to real polymer solutions",
    ", one can take the more realistic lennard - jones potentials using standard weeks - chandler - andersen procedure @xcite .",
    "however , in present work we have demonstrated only the principle possibility to describe the co - nonsolvency within self - consistent field theory , retaining its application to the experimental systems for the future researches .",
    "second , our theory in present form is based on the assumption that the entire polymer solution is incompressible .",
    "such assumption may be correct , when the polymer solution is under ambient pressure , whereas the incompressibility approximation must be invalid at the region of extremely high pressures @xcite .",
    "recently was experimentally observed @xcite and confirmed by full atomistic md simulations @xcite that co - nonsolvency of pnipam in aqueous methanol can be suppressed by application of sufficiently high pressure ( order of 500 @xmath71 ) . to describe this very interesting phenomenon",
    "theoretically it is necessary to go beyond the incompressibility approximation that is a subject of the forthcoming publications .",
    "here we present some calculation details omitted in the main text .",
    "we start from the conditional solvation free energy of polymer chain in the mixed solvent media @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the volume of gyration of the polymer chain , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are molecule numbers of the solvent and co - solvent in the gyration volume , respectively ; @xmath26 is the ideal free energy of the polymer chain and mixed solvent which can be calculated in the following way @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the expansion factor , @xmath30 is the mean - square radius of gyration of the ideal gaussian polymer chain , @xmath31 is the kuhn length of the segment , @xmath32 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath3 is the absolute temperature , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the de broglie wavelengths of the solvent species .",
