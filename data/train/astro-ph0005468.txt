    "the whipple collaboration operates a 10 m optical reflector for gamma - ray astronomy at the fred lawrence whipple observatory on mt .",
    "hopkins ( elevation 2320 m ) in southern arizona . the reflector was originally constructed in 1968 @xcite and numerous modifications have been made to improve the sensitivity and performance of the system .",
    "a camera consisting of photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) mounted in the focal plane of the reflector , detects the cherenkov radiation produced by gamma - ray and cosmic - ray air showers from which an image of the cherenkov light can be reconstructed .",
    "the camera is triggered when any two pmt signals are above a threshold within a short time coincidence .    in the past decade",
    "the camera has undergone significant expansion from a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath1 in 1989 to a fov of @xmath2 in 1999 . from 1989 to 1996",
    "the camera consisted of 109 pmts , each viewing a circular field of @xmath3 diameter , yielding a total fov of @xmath1 .",
    "the trigger condition required any two of the inner 91 pmt signals to be above a threshold within a 15 ns time coincidence . during the spring of 1997 the camera was expanded to 151 pmts yielding a total fov of @xmath4 .",
    "the trigger condition required any two of the inner 91 pmt signals ( @xmath1 triggering fov ) to be above a threshold with a coincidence resolving time of 15 ns . from 1997 to 1999",
    "the camera was further expanded to 331 pmts yielding a total fov of @xmath2 .",
    "the trigger was expanded to include all 331 pmt signals and the time coincidence was shortened to 10 ns due to the introduction of constant fraction discriminators .",
    "the layout of each camera is depicted in figure  [ figure : camera ] .",
    "a full description of the reflector , which has not changed since its original construction , can be found in @xcite .",
    "primary cosmic rays and gamma rays entering the atmosphere initiate showers of secondary particles which propagate down towards the ground .",
    "the trajectory of the shower continues along the path of the primary particle . if the optical reflector lies within the 300 m diameter cherenkov light pool , it forms an image in the pmt camera .",
    "the appearance of this image depends upon a number of factors .",
    "the nature and energy of the incident particle , the arrival direction and the point of impact of the particle trajectory on the ground , all determine the initial shape and orientation of the image .",
    "this image is modified by the point spread function of the telescope , the addition of instrumental noise in the pmts and subsequent electronics , the presence of bright stellar images in certain pmts and by spurious signals from charged cosmic rays physically passing through the tubes .",
    "monte carlo studies have shown that gamma - ray induced showers give rise to more compact images than background hadronic showers and are preferentially oriented towards the source position in the image plane @xcite . by making use of these differences , a gamma - ray signal can be extracted from the large background of hadronic showers and a gamma - ray map over the fov can be obtained .",
    "the method of extracting a gamma - ray signal from the hadronic background can be found in @xcite .",
    "the technique of obtaining a gamma - ray map of the fov , by reconstructing the unique arrival direction of very high energy photons , is the topic of this paper .",
    "data from the whipple observatory s 10 m high energy gamma - ray telescope , will be used to demonstrate methods of the reconstruction of the arrival direction of gamma - ray induced showers .",
    "these methods may be applied a ) to a search for point sources located anywhere within the camera s fov , for example searches for counterparts to egret unidentified sources , gamma - ray bursts , described in @xcite , or sky surveys and b ) analysis of extended sources of tev gamma - rays such as supernova remnants , described in @xcite and galactic plane emission described in @xcite .",
    "prior to analysis of the recorded images , two calibration operations must be performed : the subtraction of the pedestal analog - digital conversion ( adc ) values and the normalization of the pmt gains , a process known as flat - fielding .",
    "the pedestal of an adc is the finite value which it outputs for zero input .",
    "this is usually set at 20 digital counts so that small negative fluctuations on the signal line , due to night sky noise variations , will not generate negative values in the adc .",
    "the pedestal for each pmt is determined by artificially triggering the camera , thereby capturing adc values in the absence of genuine input signals .",
    "the pmt pedestal and pedestal variance are calculated from the mean and variance of the pulse - height spectrum ( phs ) generated from these injected events .",
    "the relative pmt gains are determined by recording a thousand images using a fast optitron nitrogen arc lamp illuminating the focal plane through a diffuser .",
    "these nitrogen pulser images are used to determine the relative gains by comparing the relative mean signals seen by each pmt .",
    "fluctuations in the image usually arise from electronic noise and night - sky background variations . to reject these distortions a pmt",
    "is considered to be part of the image if it either has a signal above a certain threshold or is beside such a pmt and has a signal above a lower threshold .",
    "these two thresholds are defined as the picture and boundary thresholds , respectively .",
    "the picture threshold is the multiple of the root mean square ( rms ) pedestal deviation which a pmts signal must exceed to be considered part of the picture .",
    "the boundary threshold is the multiple of the rms pedestal deviation which pmts adjacent to the picture must exceed to be part of the boundary .",
    "the picture and boundary pmts together make up the image ; all others are zeroed .",
    "this image cleaning procedure is depicted in figure  [ figure : imclean ] .",
    "these thresholds were optimized using data taken on the crab nebula yielding picture threshold : 4.25 , and boundary threshold : 2.25 .    for the results reported in this paper ,",
    "the data are obtained in an on / off mode where the source position is tracked for 28 minutes ( on ) , followed by a 28 minute observation of a background region ( off ) covering the same path in elevation and azimuth . in an on / off observation mode , differences in sky brightness between on and off",
    "sky regions could introduce biases .",
    "these biases can severely affect the selection of pixels accredited to the boundary region and hence distort the cherenkov image .",
    "for example , if the on region is brighter than the off region , bias may arise as follows .",
    "consider tubes which have a combination of small amounts of genuine signal coupled with some noise ( e.g. boundary tubes ) .",
    "if the noise level is low , the boundary threshold is low and most of these tubes will pass the threshold test and be included as part of the image .",
    "however , if the noise level is high then the boundary threshold will also be high and the probability increases that a negative noise fluctuation will cancel the genuine signal component resulting in the tube being set to zero during image cleaning .",
    "thus , the degree to which boundary tubes are set to zero depend on the noise level in the tubes . as a consequence",
    "a bright sky region will result in more boundary tubes being set to zero , making the image appear narrower and more gamma - ray like .",
    "a software technique was developed to correct for the biases introduced by the differing sky brightness @xcite .",
    "this technique , known as software padding works by adding software noise into the events for the darker sky region .",
    "let @xmath5 be the on(off ) pedestal and pedestal deviation values for a particular pixel and @xmath6 be the component due to the cherenkov signal and corresponding fluctuation .",
    "the total on signal is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a random number drawn from a gaussian distribution of zero mean and unit variance .",
    "the noise component due to the night sky light in the on region is : @xmath9    similarly , for the off region : @xmath10    suppose we are working with pairs where @xmath11 is larger than @xmath12 then we wish to add noise , @xmath13 , in the off events such that @xmath14 or @xmath15    the total off signal is then @xmath16    when the off region is brighter than the on region then @xmath13 is added to the on pixels .",
    "this software padding procedure is very efficient in removing most of the biases induced by the sky brightness with only a modest reduction in sensitivity . given the potential for large systematic errors without software padding , the modest reduction in sensitivity is a small price to pay .",
    "an example of sky brightness is given in figure  [ figure : gcygni_pedvar ] for the on and off source regions of the supernova remnant g78.2 + 2.1 ( see @xcite for the results of tev gamma - ray observations ) .",
    "for this object , located in a bright region of the galactic plane , the difference in sky brightness is quite large thus the application of software padding is essential .",
    "the results of the analysis of this extended object , with and without the application of software padding , will be presented later in this paper .",
    "we characterize each cherenkov image using a moment analysis @xcite .",
    "the roughly elliptical shape of the image is described by the _ length _ and _ width _ parameters .",
    "its location and orientation within the fov are given by the _ distance _ and @xmath17 parameters , respectively .",
    "the _ asymmetry _ parameter , defined as the third moment of the light distribution , describes the skew of the image along its major axis .",
    "we also determine the two highest signals recorded by the pmts ( _ max1 , max2 _ ) and the amount of light in the image ( _ size _ ) .",
    "these parameters are defined in table  [ table : hillasparameters ] and are depicted in figure  [ figure : hillasparameters ] .",
    ".definition of image parameters , used to characterize the image shape and orientation in the fov ( see figure  [ figure : hillasparameters]).[table : hillasparameters ] [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the spread in arrival directions for each value of @xmath18 is determined by fitting a gaussian function of standard deviation @xmath19 to the binned excess .",
    "the results are depicted in figure  [ figure : spreadarrival ] .",
    "the minimum spread occurs at a value of @xmath20 for the @xmath21 and @xmath2 camera fov respectively .",
    "the effect of the decreasing optimum value of @xmath18 with increasing fov is the result of less image truncation imposed by the larger camera .",
    "this effect is also evident in the upper bound of the optimum length cut used to select gamma - ray images ( see table  [ table : supercuts ] ) .",
    "the minimum spread is a measure of the optimum angular resolution , or point spread function ( psf ) of the technique and corresponds to @xmath22 and @xmath0 respectively .",
    "the determination of a photon s arrival direction enables the search for emission from anywhere within the camera s fov .",
    "when the source position is known , a gamma - ray signal is detected as an excess of events , between corresponding on and off source observations , originating from the source direction .",
    "firstly , events are selected as gamma - like based on the angular _ width _ and _ length _ criteria given in table  [ table : supercuts ] and their arrival directions determined as described above . secondly , the radial distance from the arrival direction to the source position , @xmath23 , is calculated and binned in @xmath24 intervals .",
    "the results of data taken with the three cameras are shown in figure  [ figure : radial ] .",
    "the area of exposure for each bin increases with greater radial distance , therefore each bin contents have been divided by the area of the annulus defined by the bin boundaries .",
    "the physical interpretation of such a distribution is the surface brightness of an extended object .      for each data set depicted in figure",
    "[ figure : radial ] , an excess gamma - ray signal is apparent in the on source observation ( solid line ) when compared to the off source observation ( dotted line ) and the excess is confined to small values of @xmath23 .",
    "the angular extent of the signal is similar for each camera , consistent with the results of the optimized angular resolution .",
    "the results of the off source observations illustrate a background which appears uniform for small values of @xmath23 with a gradual decline due to the finite size of the camera . in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 cameras ,",
    "all pmts enter into the trigger ( all of the way out to the edge of the fov ) , whereas in the @xmath4 camera only the inner 91 out of the 151 pmts enter into the trigger ( see figure  [ figure : camera ] ) .",
    "thus in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 cameras there are a number of background cosmic - ray events which lie on the edge of the camera and which are distorted by image truncation .",
    "this truncation tends to produce images whose major axes make an angle of @xmath25 and results in a significant rise in the number of events collected at large values of @xmath23 .",
    "this rise is not apparent in the results from the @xmath4 camera .",
    "the selection of events consistent with the position of the source is accomplished by counting the number of events within a circular aperture of radius @xmath26 centered at the source position .",
    "the optimum value of @xmath26 is determined using data taken with the @xmath2 camera .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ figure : optrad ] and yield an optimum selection criteria of @xmath27 .",
    "this selection criteria can be applied to the data for all camera configurations owing to the similar radial extent of the gamma - ray signal .",
    "when the angular extent of the source is of the order , or greater than the resolution of the technique , the size of the circular aperture can be adjusted to the size of the emission region . in doing so more background",
    "is included , hence sensitivity is diminished . in background",
    "dominated counting statistics , the sensitivity of a detector will be proportional to @xmath28 .",
    "if we neglect the gradual decline in the background with increasing angular offset , the sensitivity of an atmospheric cherenkov telescope utilizing this method will scale as @xmath29 .",
    "tev gamma - ray observations of the supernova remnant g78.2 + 2.1 , reported by the whipple collaboration in @xcite , is an example of an extended source .",
    "the expanding shell of the supernova explosion subtends an angle of approximately @xmath30 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath23 , for a subset of the data reported in @xcite , is given in figure  [ figure : gcygni_radial ] . in the search for a gamma - ray signal ,",
    "a circular aperture was chosen to encompass the size of the emission region plus twice the angular resolution to account for smearing of the edges .",
    "as shown in figure  [ figure : gcygni_radial ] , no significant excess was obtained .",
    "also shown is an example of a false signal resulting from biases due to sky brightness differences . without the application of software padding , the brighter on source region yields a greater number of background events selected as gamma - rays resulting in a significant excess between the on and off source observations .",
    "we compare the gamma - ray collection efficiency and background rejection of the aperture selection method with the traditional supercuts criteria using data taken on the crab nebula , the standard candle for tev gamma - ray astronomy .",
    "the results from the three camera configurations are given in table  [ table : supercutsvsaperture ] .",
    "the data collected with the @xmath1 camera was taken in january - february 1995 .",
    "like the traditional supercuts criteria , the aperture selection includes events which are oriented towards the center of the fov .",
    "however , the aperture selection has two further constraints in that events must be skewed towards the center of the fov and must be elongated in proportion to the impact parameter on the ground .",
    "these additional criteria result in greater background rejection compared with supercuts .",
    "results from the @xmath1 camera indicate a reduced gamma - ray collection efficiency due to image truncation imposed by the smaller fov .",
    "truncated images reduce the effectiveness of the _ asymmetry _ parameter by clipping the tails of the light distribution which defines the skewness of the image .",
    "data collected with the @xmath4 and @xmath2 cameras were taken in january - february 1997 and november 1998 - january 1999 respectively . first note that for the data taken with the @xmath2 fov camera , a degradation of mirror reflectivity and lack of light cones resulted in an increased energy threshold and lower count rate on the crab nebula . despite the increased threshold this data can still be used to judge the effectiveness of the extended camera .",
    "these results not only show the same improvement in background rejection over the traditional supercuts criteria , but indicate similar gamma - ray collection efficiency .",
    "this results in a marginal increase in sensitivity of the aperture selection criteria over traditional supercuts .",

    "events are first selected as gamma - like based on the angular _ width _ and _ length _ criteria given in table  [ table : supercuts ] , and their arrival directions determined as described above .",
    "next , the contents of each grid point within the optimum cut on the radial distance from the arrival direction is incremented by one .",
    "figure  [ figure : grid ] shows the accumulated grid contents for data taken with the @xmath4 camera .",
    "conceptually , this performs a type of image smoothing about the calculated photon arrival direction resulting in an oversampled gamma - ray map which is tuned to the search for point sources anywhere within the camera s fov .",
    "the statistical significance of excess events between on and corresponding off source observations is calculated for each grid point using the method of @xcite .",
    "the use of poissonian statistics is valid in this case because grid points are incremented by unity .",
    "however , one must be careful in interpreting the significance . to be precise",
    ", the test statistic calculated at each grid point can only be interpreted as significance if there was a prior hypothesis for gamma - ray emission from a point source at that position .",
    "otherwise , the number of independent grid points tested , or trials factor , must be taken into account thereby degrading the significance .",
    "for example , for a grid ( @xmath39 fov divided into @xmath38 bins ) with 1521 grid points ( not independent ) we have effectively 324 trials and expect on average one @xmath40 excess .",
    "an example of a tev gamma - ray image of a region of sky ( the supernova remnant g78.2 + 2.1 ) , found to be devoid of a gamma - ray signal , is shown in figure  [ figure : gcygni_image ] .",
    "the image shows several @xmath41 excesses and one @xmath40 excess .",
    "however , without a prior hypothesis for gamma - ray emission from a point source at these positions a trials factor for the number of independent grid points must applied , resulting in a reduction in significance .",
    "also shown in figure  [ figure : gcygni_image ] is an example of a false signal resulting from biases due to sky brightness differences .",
    "the region of the image showing the greatest excesses appear well correlated with the sky brightness difference between the on and off source regions as depicted in figure  [ figure : gcygni_pedvar ] .    to test the efficacy of the technique and measure the efficiency and sensitivity away from the center of the fov , we analyzed data taken on the crab nebula which was offset in declination .",
    "the results are shown in figures  [ figure : craboffset3.0],[figure : craboffset3.5 ] and [ figure : craboffset4.8 ] for the @xmath21 and @xmath2 cameras respectively .",
    "the contours are proportional to the statistical significance of the excess between the on and off source data . the peak excess and detected gamma - ray rates",
    "are given in table  [ table : offsetresults ] .",

    "for the @xmath4 and @xmath2 cameras , the crab nebula was detected with a sensitivity of approximately @xmath40/hr for an offset of @xmath50 .",
    "the derived position of the crab nebula was within the @xmath38 pointing accuracy of the whipple 10 m telescope for offsets less than @xmath51 .",
    "we note that there appears to be a small systematic shift of the derived position of the crab nebula for the @xmath51 and @xmath50 offsets for the data taken with the @xmath4 camera and for the @xmath50 offsets for the data taken with the @xmath2 camera .",
    "the shift is most likely due to the inclusion of truncated images as the source moves closer to the edge of the fov .",
    "the spread of events about the derived source position was determined by fitting a gaussian function to the unsmoothed binned excess .",
    "the results indicate that the psf is approximately constant over the fov of the camera and thus not dependent on the optical properties of the reflector which degrade with increasing angular offset .",
    "as the gamma - ray source moves away from the center of the camera , less of the cherenkov light pool falls on the detector at a given impact parameter .",
    "this has the effect of reducing the collection area for gamma - rays .",
    "the measurements of the gamma - ray rate from the crab nebula at increasing angular offset is a direct measure of this reduction as shown in figure  [ figure : craboffset ] .",
    "the effective fov , which we arbitrarily define as the radius corresponding to a 50% efficiency , appears to scale linearly with camera physical fov , at least up to the range of offsets and camera sizes included in these results .",
    "for example , a camera with a physical fov of @xmath52 would have an effective fov double that of a camera with a @xmath1 fov . moreover , by doubling the diameter of the fov a fourfold increase in sensitive area for sources offset from the center of the fov is realized .",
    "we have described a method of atmospheric cherenkov imaging which reconstructs the unique arrival direction of tev gamma - rays using a single telescope . this method is derived empirically making use of the crab nebula as a standard candle to optimize the angular resolution of the technique .",
    "this allows a selection of events based on the position of a source anywhere within the telescope s fov .",
    "we found that such a selection yields similar sensitivity and collection efficiency to the traditional supercuts criteria utilized by the whipple collaboration .",
    "however , as demonstrated , the technique is easily applicable to sources offset from the center of the fov or sources of extended emission .",
