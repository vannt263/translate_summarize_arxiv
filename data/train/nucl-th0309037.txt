    "in this work we first discuss the problem of the hartree - fock ( hf ) mean field for an infinite system of fermions ( nucleons ) at finite temperature @xmath0 in the context of matsubara theory .",
    "in particular we study under which conditions and how the results obtained in the matsubara framework in the @xmath3 limit coincide with those of the @xmath1 feynman theory .    as is well - known , the two formalisms lead to identical results _ in the absence of symmetry breaking _ , according to the old theorem for spin one - half fermions of kohn , luttinger and ward ( klw ) @xcite , at least as far as the ground state energy is concerned . here",
    "we extend the theorem to the single - particle propagator ( and hence to any one - body observable ) , aiming at transparently displaying how the cancellation of the diagrams , the mechanism at the basis of klw , is realized and how the exact @xmath1 limit is retrieved .",
    "specifically we shall assess quantitatively the magnitude of the diagrams that , while canceling in the @xmath4 limit , actually substantially contribute at finite @xmath0 ( not , however , in finite systems @xcite ) .",
    "concerning the size of their contribution to observables like the chemical potential and the magnetization , it turns out to be larger in the proximity of the fermi temperature @xmath5 owing to the temperature dependence of the self - energy .",
    "the latter , in fact , displays a marked change near @xmath5 reflecting the transition from a quantal to a classical regime .",
    "this transition is sensitively affected by the range of the interaction : hence in our study we employ both a finite and a zero - range force , however of schematic nature since we have no pretense of performing a realistic calculation , but rather we aim to investigate the generic temperature behavior of observables that are relevant for the finite temperature physics ( such as the chemical potential and the magnetization ) in the absence or presence of a symmetry breaking .",
    "we address this last issue in the second part of the paper .",
    "when a symmetry is broken then klw no longer holds and accordingly we explore the impact on the hf field of such an occurrence , both when the breaking is induced explicitly by an external field ( as an example we shall consider the case of a constant , uniform magnetic field acting on a system of neutrons ) and when it is spontaneous . in the first instance we show how the diagrams that would cancel each other at small temperature in a situation of pure symmetry no longer do so : actually their contribution grows , at @xmath4 , keeps the value attained at @xmath6 if the applied magnetic field is large enough .",
    "moreover , and interestingly , in this situation the successive iterations approach the self - consistent mean field solution smoothly or oscillating around the hf value depending upon the _ sign _ of the two - body interaction among neutrons .",
    "a ferromagnetic force gently leads to the hf mean field , whereas an antiferromagnetic force entails an approach to the latter oscillating around its value , the magnitude of the oscillations increasing with the strength of the interaction .",
    "this behavior contrasts the one occurring in the absence of symmetry breaking where the hf solution is always smoothly reached and , in fact , it is also rapidly reached  at least for a pure exchange interaction ( the one we confine ourselves to consider ) at small and large temperature : in the first case because of the klw theorem , in the second because the large t domain is where quantum physics is gone and classical physics sets in .",
    "the unusual property , referred to above , of the finite temperature hf solutions in presence of a magnetic field @xmath2 stems in part from the remarkable occurrence that @xmath2 , in breaking the spin rotational symmetry of the system , induces in the interaction matrix element a direct term which otherwise would be absent , the force we employ being of pure exchange character .",
    "this is of importance when one aims to recover the vanishing temperature limit of the observables , say the magnetization , computed in the matsubara hf formalism in the framework of the @xmath1 feynman theory .",
    "this in fact turns out to be possible , _ in spite of the breakdown of the klw theorem _ , using linear response theory , whose applicability is however limited to a specific range of @xmath2 , which we are able to assess _",
    "quantitatively_.    concerning instead the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking , the non - relativistic quantum field theory describes its occurrence at @xmath7 through the linearization of the equations of motion , i.e. at the mean field level , if the interaction is strong enough @xcite .",
    "this approach coincides with the many - body hartree mean field theory at @xmath1 , which indeed exhibits a spontaneous breaking of symmetry  again for a force strong enough  provided the variational search for the determinant yielding the minimum energy is allowed to span all of the possible symmetry configurations ( we refer to this approach as the",
    "_ generalized @xmath1 hf _ ) .",
    "this is the path we follow in the last section in the framework of the anomalous propagator technique @xcite at @xmath1 .",
    "likewise , also the temperature hf theory displays a spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "we prefer , however , to search for the onset of the latter in the framework of the @xmath1 linear response theory which , in parallel to the temperature hf , predicts , either in ring or in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , a divergent magnetic susceptibility of the fermi system when the strength of the nucleon - nucleon interaction , _ assumed to be ferromagnetic _ , reaches a critical value @xmath8 , thus signaling the occurrence of a phase transition . for a contact interaction , when the response of the system is computed in ring approximation , the value of @xmath8 thus found is identical to the one obtained in @xcite or in the generalized hartree approximation , whereas the rpa response yields a lower value ( by a factor 2/3 ) , which coincides with the one predicted by the @xmath1 generalized hf theory .",
    "as mentioned above , the same result is obtained using the thermal single - particle hf propagator , computed with a contact interaction , in the @xmath9 limit .",
    "when the symmetry is spontaneously broken , one would like to describe the associated goldstone modes . in connection with the collective excitations of the system , at zero temperature it turns out that , for an anti - ferromagnetic coupling among the constituents , the fermi system supports the existence of zero - sound collective modes characterized by a linear relationship between energy and momentum .",
    "these modes correspond to the spin waves ( also referred to as magnons ) found in the antiferromagnetic materials and _ lower _ the susceptibility .",
    "they represent the goldstone modes , because our system , although without any cristal structure , still lives in a condensed phase given by the antiferromagnetic order of the spin constituents : we accordingly view the fermi gas as paramagnetic at finite @xmath0 and antiferromagnetic at @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand a ferromagnetic interaction only supports the existence of modes embedded in the particle - hole continuum for @xmath10 . in this regime",
    "such a force softens the response function of the system until , when @xmath11 , the latter diverges at zero excitation energy as the transferred momentum becomes very small .",
    "thus the phase transition is also displayed by the behavior of the response function , which basically corresponds to the spin - spin correlation function .",
    "on the other hand , for a ferromagnetic coupling @xmath12 new collective modes appear , in the direction orthogonal to the one set by the spontaneous magnetization of the system .",
    "these also represent goldstone modes and will be addressed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "in this section we discuss the mean - field hf theory of a system of nucleons at finite temperature . for simplicity",
    "we confine ourselves to consider an infinite homogeneous system and a schematic static exchange interaction in the non - relativistic limit .    the perturbative expansion of the hf irreducible self - energy for a pure exchange interaction.,height=151 ]    in this situation it is well - known that at zero temperature the hf mean - field theory reduces to first order perturbation theory .",
    "indeed for the single - particle wave functions self - consistency is immediately achieved in the first iteration of the hf equations owing to the translational invariance of the system . in conformity , the diagrams contributing to the hf self - energy ( displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : hfself ] ) vanish , except for the first one : indeed all of them display in the energy variable poles of order @xmath13 with zero residue .",
    "for example , considering the diagram ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : hfself ] one has @xmath14^{2 } g^{0}(\\vec{k}_{2},\\omega_2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath15 being the interaction and @xmath16 the zero - order propagator in a fermi gas with fermi momentum @xmath17 .",
    "now , in the frequency integral , @xmath18^{2 } \\nonumber \\\\    & = & \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } \\frac{{\\d }      \\omega_{1}}{2\\pi } e^{i\\omega_{1}\\eta}\\left [    \\frac{\\theta(|\\vec{k}_{1}|-k_{f})}{(\\omega_{1}-\\omega_{\\vec{k}_{1}}+i\\eta)^2 }    + \\frac{\\theta^(k_f-|\\vec{k}_{1}|)}{(\\omega_{1}-\\omega_{\\vec{k}_{1}}-i\\eta)^2 }      \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] only the double pole at @xmath19 should be considered , the contour of the integration lying in the complex upper plane @xmath20 .",
    "hence one gets @xmath21 and likewise for all the other diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : hfself ] of order @xmath13 .    on the other hand , at finite temperature the matsubara diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : hfself ] no longer vanish .",
    "in fact , taking again as an example the second order self - energy , one has @xmath22^{2 }       { \\mathcal{g}}^{0}(\\vec{k}_{2},\\omega_{n_2}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the thermal free propagator at finite @xmath24 ( @xmath25 being the boltzmann s constant and @xmath26 the free chemical potential ) . evaluating the frequency sums according to the standard rule @xmath27 and @xmath28^{2 } & = & \\lim_{\\eta \\to 0^{+ } }      \\sum_{n_{1 } }",

    "we briefly illustrate this point using , as an example , a simple static spin - isospin dependent nucleon - nucleon central interaction of the type @xmath31 which , of course , has no pretense of being realistic .    since the system is homogeneous , the eigenfunctions are still plane waves , whereas the hf eigenvalues read @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the hf irreducible self energy for the interaction ( [ interazione ] ) , @xmath34 the fermi distribution and @xmath35 the fourier transform of @xmath36 .",
    "thus the hf equations at finite temperature , unlike the case at @xmath1 , represent a non trivial self - consistency problem , because the single - particle energies ( the eigenvalues ) enter not only in the equations , but in the fermi distribution as well .",
    "accordingly , the system of equations    [ sistema ] @xmath37    where the density @xmath38 of the system is assumed to be fixed , should be solved .",
    "we have accomplished this task through numerical iterations of the above equations ( the unknowns being @xmath39 and @xmath26 ) until reaching self - consistency ( see subsection  [ subsec : hfres ] for the numerical results ) .    at zero order @xmath40 and one fixes @xmath41 through eq .",

    "the latter is then put back in ( [ sistemaa ] ) together with @xmath47 in order to generate @xmath48 and so on .    numerically the procedure is quite straightforward .",
    "however , it is of interest to analyze its diagrammatic content , since it helps to understand the different roles played by the various classes of diagrams at zero and finite temperature .",

    "[ fig : gd2]a and will be used to fix a new chemical potential @xmath54 .",
    "then , solving the dyson equation with @xmath53 as a kernel will obviously lead to the new propagator shown in fig .",

    "( [ eq : v1critring ] ) , whereas , when @xmath287 ( hf approximation ) , coincides with the linear response value in rpa in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v1critrpa ] ) .",
    "it is clear that with the propagator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ghf+- ] ) it would now be possible to study the system s response to an external probe when the vacuum is broken and the associated collective modes .",
    "these split into excitations along the @xmath116-axis ( assumed as the direction along which the spontaneous symmetry breaking has taken place ) and along the directions orthogonal to it ( goldstone modes ) .",
    "this topic is presently addressed in a work in progress .",
    "we anticipate , however , that we expect to get in this case a collective mode characterized by a _ quadratic _",
    " not _ linear _ as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : magnons ] )  dispersion relation , which is the one actually exhibited by ferromagnetic crystals .",
    "our guess is supported by the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , where , for a system ( asymmetric nuclear matter ) displaying a spontaneous symmetry breaking in the isospin space , a collective mode with a quadratic dispersion relation has indeed been found .",
    "in this work we have reexamined the issue of the connection between the matsubara theory at finite @xmath0 and the feynman one at @xmath1 addressing a specific example , namely an infinite homogeneous system of nucleons , and a specific theoretical many - body framework , namely the hf mean field .",
    "our focus has been on how the theorem of kohn , luttinger and ward is actually implemented .",
    "in fact , the klw theorem assures the identity between the @xmath1 feynman theory and the @xmath9 limit of the matsubara one ( at least for systems made up with spin one - half fermions ) when no symmetry breaking occurs .",
    "yet , one would like to know the actual temperature behavior of the hf diagrams of order higher than one : these in fact rigorously vanish at @xmath1  for a static interaction  when computed as feynman diagrams , but not when computed as @xmath9 matsubara diagrams .",
    "thus the theorem is realized through a cancellation , which becomes `` complete '' at @xmath1 and `` minimal '' at the fermi temperature @xmath5 .",
    "hence , here is where the hf problem for an infinite system becomes nearly as complex as in finite systems : indeed , reaching self - consistency at @xmath5 requires to account for many diagrams beyond the first order ones or , equivalently , to perform many iterations when searching for a solution of the non - linear , non - local hf equations . just how many it depends , of course , on the density and on the interaction and , concerning the latter , more on its range than on its strength : in fact , for a contact force the hf problem in an infinite system at any @xmath0 remains as trivial as it is at @xmath1 , namely it simply amounts to first order perturbation theory .",
    "it becomes trivial as well at large @xmath0 , at least when the interaction is of pure exchange ( and hence of pure quantum ) nature , which is the one we confine ourselves to consider , for sake of illustration , in this paper : large @xmath0 indeed means classical physics .",
    "in addition , the impact of any interaction is no longer felt at large @xmath0 , where the kinetic energy dominates .",
    "when a symmetry is broken , so it is the klw theorem . in the second part of this work we have addressed this issue again , aiming at exploring more closely how this occurrence is emerging in a specific case , meant to be illustrative of the phenomenon in general .",
    "we have thus studied a system of neutrons placed in an external magnetic field @xmath2 , which dynamically breaks the rotational invariance of the system s hamiltonian in spin space . for the purpose of clarifying the physics",
    "we choose the strength of @xmath2 very large .",
    "three basic features emerge from our analysis .",
    "first , although our two - body potential is of purely exchange nature  thus entailing only a fock term in the interaction matrix elements  the presence of @xmath2 restores the presence of a hartree term as well , whose relevance dependes upon the observable one is dealing with .",
    "thus , in our example , the role of the induced hartree term is minor as far as the chemical potential in concerned , but substantial in the magnetization .",
    "secondly , as @xmath9 the successive iterations leading to the self - consistent field no longer cancel each other  as they would were the klw theorem valid  rather they yield a net contribution , actually as large as it is at @xmath5 , which stays pretty constant in the temperature range from @xmath5 to @xmath1 .",
    "we have verified the above outcome for the case of the chemical potential in the presence of an unrealistically large magnetic field ; different values of @xmath2 would affect the size of the contribution , but not its existence .",
    "finally , it turns out that the approach to the self - consistent solution is much dependent upon the _ sign _ of the exchange interaction : indeed , we have found that a ferromagnetic coupling among the neutrons swiftly and smoothly leads to the hf mean field , whereas an antiferromagnetic coupling not only requires more iterations before reaching self - consistency , but also entails an approach to the latter which `` oscillates '' around the self - consistent solution .",
    "given that in the presence of a dynamical symmetry breaking the feynman and matsubara theories in the @xmath9 limit provide different results and that those of matsubara are the correct ones , the question naturally arises : is it possible to obtain the right expectation values for the observables also in the framework of the zero - temperature theory ?",
    "the answer to this question is positive , provided the appropriate propagator is used at @xmath1 to compute the observables .",
    "thus , in the example we have treated , the chemical potential and the magnetization obtained from the hf single - particle thermal propagator in a magnetic field @xmath223 can be obtained as well in the framework of feynman theory at @xmath1 using the polarization propagator @xmath233 .",
    "the latter should however embody the resummation of an infinite number of loops : specifically , the results obtained from @xmath223 in the @xmath9 limit are recoverd in the @xmath1 framework using @xmath288 .",
    "actually this correspondence applies to any infinite subset of many - body diagrams , in the sense , for instance , that @xmath289 corresponds to @xmath290 and @xmath220 ( the steps of the ladder being between a particle and a hole ) corresponds to @xmath291 .",
    "of course , in the absence of any interaction the correspondence is between @xmath211 and @xmath221 .",
    "however , the above statements are valid only in a limited range of values of @xmath2 , namely as long as the linear response theory is tenable .",
    "it is worth noticing that we can actually compute this range by comparing the predictions ( e.  g. , on the magnetization ) of the single - particle thermal propagator in the @xmath9 limit with those of the polarization propagator .",
    "it turns out that the range of applicability of the linear response theory is not much affected by the many - body scheme employed .",
    "a remarkable feature of the linear response theory lies in its ability to predict the onset of a phase transition in the system , in our case of the ferromagnetic phase , as a function not of the temperature , but rather of the strength of the coupling constant @xmath65 viewed as a control parameter entering into the system s hamiltonian .",
    "in fact , expressing the magnetic susceptibility of the system via the real part of @xmath233 and searching for the poles of the latter in the variable @xmath65 , one finds @xcite , both in rpa and in ring approximation , the critical values @xmath292 and @xmath293 where the phase transition starts to occur _ if the coupling is ferromagnetic _ ( incipient ferromagnetism ) .    indeed ,",
    "as it is well known , the spontaneous symmetry breaking is heralded by a dramatic increase of the isothermal susceptibility and by a spectacular enhancement of the spin response function at wavevectors small enough to encompass the long range spin order taking place in the system .",
    "note that @xmath292 and @xmath293 are substantially different for a contact force ( by a factor 2/3 , @xmath293 being the larger one , showing that the phase transition is made easier by antisymmetrization ) , while they become closer and closer as the range of the interaction increases , as it should be .",
    "for an antiferromagnetic coupling the above does not occur because , as already anticipated , the fermi gas , even in the absence of the interaction , lives in the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "hence , it should display goldstone modes with a linear relationship between frequency and wavevector , which indeed we have found .",
    "naturally , one would like as well to explore the goldstone modes in the ferromagnetic case : this we have not done , but we have paved the way to their investigation using the technique of the anomalous propagator .",
    "in fact , in the ferromagnetic phase the system develops two fermi momenta , @xmath258 and @xmath259 , and , as a consequence , the single - particle propagator , while still diagonal in the spin indices , is no longer proportional to the unit matrix , but splits into the two components @xmath294 and @xmath295 .",
    "these we have computed and , with their help , we have computed as well the system s energy per particle in terms of the magnetization @xmath190 . by minimizing the energy with respect to @xmath190 or , equivalently , by requiring identical chemical potential for the two spin species of particles , we have found the critical value of the coupling constant , @xmath296 , yielding a fully magnetized system , a result impossible to reach in the standard linear response theory framework .",
    "worth mentioning is that the hf value of @xmath296 is lower than the corresponding values obtained in the simpler schemes of the hartree s or fock s theories .",
    "the above results clearly would not be attainable in the scheme of the feynman perturbative theory at @xmath1 , even using the polarization propagator , which of course illustrates that in the presence of a spontaneous symmetry breaking the klw theorem does not hold .    in conclusion",
    ", it appears worth remarking that the _ free _ fermi gas , a system to be viewed at @xmath1 as antiferromagnetic owing to its spin - zero wave function , when the interaction is switched on displays both in the ferromagnetic and in the antiferromagnetic phases the same magnons found in crystals , in spite of being a continuous system .",
    "this recognition offers the opportunity to establish a contact between the computations performed on the lattice and within advanced many - body frameworks based on the fermi gas model , for example in connection with the heisenberg hamiltonian . not however with the ising model , which , although dealing with a physics not so far from the one dealt with in this paper , actually does not display the variety of collective ( goldstone ) modes showing up in the present system .",
    "this occurrence reflects the fact that what is broken is a discrete symmetry in the ising model , a continuous one in our infinite , homogeneous system of neutrons .",
