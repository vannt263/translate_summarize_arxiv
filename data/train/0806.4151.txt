    "each region in the figure which is non - empty and bounded contributes a generator to the basis for the homology of the intersection lattice .",
    "+ the fact that the hyperplane @xmath5 is generic is equivalent to the fact that @xmath124 and @xmath125 for all @xmath126-dimensional subspaces @xmath127 ( section @xmath128 of @xcite )",
    ". we will refer to a non - zero vector in a one dimensional subspace @xmath112 as a ray .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to check that @xmath5 is generic with respect to the set of rays . in section [ vector ] , we describe for any @xmath0 , the general construction of a vector @xmath110 with @xmath5 generic . in section",
    "[ special ] , we use the construction of @xmath110 to explicitly embed the homology of the non - crossing partition lattice in the homology of the intersection lattice .",

    "we now compute @xmath144 .",
    "@xmath145 the last equality follows from the formula for the sum of a geometric series and the fact that @xmath146 .      in order to relate the homology basis for non - crossing partition lattices to the homology basis for the corresponding intersection lattice ,",
    "we apply the operator + @xmath147 from @xcite to @xmath3 to obtain a complex which we will call @xmath148 and which is the positive part of the complex @xmath149 studied in @xcite . the complex @xmath148 has vertices @xmath150 and a simplex on @xmath151 if @xmath152 the walls of the facets of @xmath149 are hyperplanes .",
    "since regions considered in @xcite are bounded by reflection hyperplanes , this provides the connection between the two and explains why we use @xmath148 instead of @xmath3 .",

    "furthermore for each @xmath23 , there is at least one @xmath164 with @xmath165 by linear independence of @xmath129 . since all the coefficients of @xmath110 are strictly positive , @xmath166 .",
    "the projection of @xmath148 onto the affine hyperplane @xmath5 where @xmath110 is as in proposition 4.2 induces an embedding of the homology of the non - crossing partition lattice into the homology of the corresponding intersection lattice .",
    "recall from section [ homotopy ] that homology generators for the non - crossing partition lattice are identified with the boundaries of facets of @xmath3 and hence with facets of @xmath148 . on the other hand",
    ", we can use the generic vector @xmath110 to identify homology generators of the intersection lattice with cycles @xmath113 corresponding to regions @xmath114 such that @xmath115 is nonempty and bounded . from @xcite ,",
    "the boundary of each facet of @xmath148 is a union of pieces of reflection hyperplanes .",
    "it follows that vertices @xmath167 for @xmath168 are rays and each facet of @xmath148 projects to a union of affine slices of the form @xmath115 .",
    "furthermore , the projection of distinct @xmath148 facets have disjoint interiors .",
    "+ we denote the projection map by @xmath169 and by @xmath170 the induced map from the homology of the non - crossing partition lattice to the homology of the intersection lattice .",
