    ", width=288 ]    the detailed form of the spectrum is essentially determined by the fact that the effective coupling between the modes vanishes with time .",
    "right after arrival of the second pulse the polarization oscillates with the frequency detuned from the exciton frequency by the value @xmath112 , where the second term estimates the contribution of the bessel functions .",
    "this detuned frequency qualitatively describes the dependence of the frequencies of the detached resonances on the signal area ( see the bold solid line in fig .",

    "in particular it shows that the resonances in the spectrum widen with increasing nonlinear parameter @xmath113 . in the opposite limit , @xmath114",

    "these oscillations give rise to the resonant behavior at the exciton frequency , for which dependence on the pulse area is determined by the asymptotic value of the bessel functions @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , the response at the exciton frequency essentially depends on whether the system is in perturbative or non - perturbative regime .",

    "for the case of fwm signal this result agrees with the perturbational calculations.@xcite    in the non - perturbative regime the positive and negative delay signals are determined by the oscillating asymptotics of the bessel functions@xcite @xmath124 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where  @xmath125 \" (  @xmath126 \" ) sign corresponds to the positive ( negative ) delay .",
    "writing eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonpert_positive_negative ] ) we have neglected the oscillating term @xmath127 vanishing as @xmath128 with increasing signal area .",

    "the strong asymmetry between these cases specific for the perturbative regime does not hold any longer and the only difference is the phase of the oscillations .",
    "it should be noted that in ref .",
    "the saturation of the fwm response was attributed to the renormalization of the pulse area by the eid and eis .",
    "the present consideration , however , suggests that the origin of the non - trivial dependence of the response on the pulse area is the redistribution of the excitation over multi - wave mixing modes . considering the identity @xmath130 for the limits @xmath131 and @xmath132",
    "it can be seen that such redistribution is especially effective in the nonperturbative regime resulting in essential suppression of the fwm response .",
    "it should be emphasized that the mechanism of the oscillatory dependence of the response at the exciton frequency is different from the rabi oscillations,@xcitewhich would correspond to the non - monotonous dependence of the immediate response on the excitation field . in the case under consideration",
    "the oscillations are the result of the free dynamics of the exciton polarization when the external field is turned off .",
    "the physics of the rabi oscillations and of the oscillations of @xmath133 , of course , are essentially the same .",
    "as noted above the dynamics of the polarization in the case under consideration appears analogous to a 1d tight - binding model with vanishing coupling between the neighboring sites .",

    "the magnitude of the signal is @xmath148 this saturation also is of the dynamical origin since we work in the regime of weak saturation due to the pauli blocking ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "the significant difference with the previously considered situation is that now the minima of the spectrum as a function of the pulse area are not equally spaced as the oscillating part has the form @xmath150 .",

    "finally , we discuss the effect of the saturation parameter .",
    "qualitatively , this effect can be understood as follows .",
    "the non - monotonous behavior of the semiconductor response on the pulse area studied above is supported by unrestricted increase of the polarization of the immediate response [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : immediate_response_low_saturation ] ) ] . however , the saturation effect renormalizes the pulse area so that the magnitude of the polarization can not exceed @xmath92 .",

    "( [ eq : factorized_spectrum ] ) remains valid only if two restrictions are met @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "this imposes the restriction of the decay rate to be sufficiently small @xmath153 .",

    "these effects are analyzed using the exact solution of the non - linear equation of motion of the exciton polarization taking into account excitation induced shift ( eis ) , excitation induced decay ( eid ) and the saturation effect phenomenologically .",
    "we found that the interaction between the excitons accounted by eis leads to two specific spectral features  a split of the exciton peak and a non - monotonous dependence of the response at the exciton frequency @xmath0 on the magnitude of the external field .",
    "the important characteristic of the splitting is that new spectral features should appear at frequencies higher than @xmath0 .",
    "this allows one to make a distinction between the effect of interaction of the exciton modes and the manifestation of bound biexciton states , which should modify the spectrum at frequencies lower than @xmath0 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that these effects do not appear in any order of the perturbational ( @xmath154 ) approach .",
    "it can be shown that the appearance of additional spectral features can be traced as a divergence of the perturbational series .",
    "it should be stressed out that the crossover from the perturbative to non - perturbative regimes is governed by parameters that essentially depend on the decay rate ( e.g. latexmath:[$\\beta    @xmath91 ) .",
    "this means that the condition of low excitation itself does not necessarily warrant the validity of the perturbation theory . as an ultimate example one can consider the model with @xmath156 when the spectrum ( for @xmath157 ) has the form @xmath158 with the exciton peak being splitted for arbitrary low excitations .",
