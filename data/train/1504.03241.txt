    "hot subdwarf stars ( see a review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are core helium burning stars with very thin hydrogen envelopes and belong to the extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) .",
    "the mass of most hot subdwarfs is about 0.5m@xmath2 .",
    "the origin of ehb stars , i.e , the hot , hydrogen - rich ( sdb ) and helium - rich subdwarf ( sdo ) stars , is closely linked to binarity .",
    "@xcite first proposed that sdb stars are formed in close binary systems and @xcite inferred the presence of an extremely thin hydrogen envelope ( @xmath3m@xmath2 ) .",
    "@xcite proposed three formation channels for sdb stars through binary interaction , i.e. , common envelope ( ce ) , roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) , and binary merger .",
    "@xcite predict a binary fraction of 76 - 89 per cent with orbital periods ranging from 0.5  hr to 500  d. however , they caution that the observed frequency could be much lower due to selection effects .",
    "the proposed formation channels also predict single sdb stars that form via the merger of two helium white dwarfs .",
    "approximately 11 - 26 per cent of subdwarfs are expected to form via this merger channel @xcite .",
    "formation channels of helium - rich ( he - sdo ) stars are not as well defined .",
    "@xcite proposed that these objects may form in a close double degenerate binary with the massive component accreting from a helium white dwarf companion and initiating helium - shell burning .",
    "a small number of sdo stars are known to exist as companions to be stars @xcite .",
    "these sdo stars are formed through close binary interaction where the more massive primary star begins mass transfer onto its less massive companion during its shell - hydrogen burning phase .",
    "the result of this mass transfer leaves a spun up be star with an sdo companion @xcite .",
    "cool companions to hot subdwarf stars can be revealed as infrared excess in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . @xcite and @xcite detected infrared excess in over 20 per cent of the hot subdwarf stars studied in their sample . @xcite",
    "explored photometric surveys that cover a wide wavelength range , from the galaxy evolution explorer ( @xmath4 ) ultraviolet survey through to the infrared , the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) and the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) , and searched for main - sequence companions to hot subdwarf stars .",
    "they found that the most common companions to hot subdwarfs have a spectral type between f0 and k0 , while m - type companions were found to be much rarer .    radial velocity surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of sdb stars have shown that approximately half of all sdb stars reside in close binary systems with either a cool main - sequence star or a white dwarf companion .",
    "these surveys target binary systems with periods of a few hours to @xmath5 days .",
    "@xcite reported a binary fraction of 39 per cent of sdb stars from the eso supernovae type ia progenitor survey ( spy ) .",
    "@xcite estimated a higher binary fraction of 46 - 56 per cent from their survey of sdb stars selected from the palomar - green and edinburgh - cape surveys .",
    "a few rare sdb stars are found in close orbit with a massive white dwarf ( @xmath6m@xmath2 ) , making them type ia supernova progenitors .",
    "these systems would first evolve to am cvn systems before detonating either as a type ia or the less energetic type  .ia ( iax ) supernova @xcite .",
    "the first such candidate is kpd 1930 + 2752 @xcite , with a second candidate , galex  j1411@xmath13053 ( cd@xmath130  11223 ) , discovered as part of our radial velocity survey of @xmath4 selected hot subdwarf stars @xcite .",
    "some sdb stars in close binary systems have stellar parameters that fall below the zero - age horizontal branch and probably did not initiate helium burning .",
    "such objects have very low masses ( @xmath7m@xmath2 ) and are the progenitors of extremely low mass ( elm ) white dwarfs , which will in time evolve into am cvn systems .",
    "if the companion to these low mass stars is a massive enough white dwarf , then the system may become a type ia supernova .",
    "the first known low mass sdb star , hd  188112 , was discovered by @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered the first double subdwarf binary , pg  1544@xmath8488 .",
    "this helium rich sdb ( he - sdb ) binary remains , at the present time , unique . the mass ratio determined from the velocity semi - amplitude of the components show that they have a similar mass which suggests that the system emerged from a ce comprised of two nearly identical red giant cores @xcite .",
    "alternatively , @xcite interpreted the peculiar atmospheric composition of he - sdb stars , such as pg  1544@xmath8488 , with evolutionary models involving a delayed helium - core flash and convective mixing while descending on the white dwarf cooling track .",
    "similarly , he  0301@xmath13039 is a close binary consisting of two sdo stars @xcite that may be the outcome of double - core ce evolution @xcite .",
    "surveys of hot subdwarfs involving photometric time series have uncovered several more low mass sdb stars .",
    "kepler observations revealed that kic 6614501 is another low mass sdb plus white dwarf system @xcite .",
    "also , @xcite presented 17 eclipsing systems from wide angle search for planets ( wasp ) survey that are likely to contain a pre - helium white dwarf , similar to the system 1swasp  j024743.37@xmath1251549.2 @xcite .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy for six of these systems confirmed them to be main - sequence a stars with very low mass ( @xmath7m@xmath2 ) pre - he white dwarfs currently experiencing hydrogen - shell burning .",
    "wider binaries ( orbital periods @xmath9 years ) containing a sdb star with a cool main - sequence companion were reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the predicted period distribution by @xcite is bimodal with some b to f type companions in the longer - period range : the relative frequency of short- to long - period binaries depends on the actual value of the critical mass ratio for stable mass transfer ; this ratio may be set with a study of potential subdwarf plus a - star binaries .",
    "@xcite showed that these long period binaries are the result of stable rlof .",
    "@xcite and @xcite presented a new sample of sdb stars selected from the @xmath4 all - sky survey and we conducted a radial velocity survey of a subsample of stars from this selection .",
    "the first two systems ( galex  j0321@xmath84727 and galex  j2349@xmath83844 ) discovered as part of this survey were presented by @xcite , followed by the aforementioned short - period system galex  j1411@xmath13053 @xcite .",
    "additional spectroscopic and photometric observations of the first two systems were presented in @xcite along with a progress report on the other systems that were observed as part of this programme .",
    "the photometric observations confirmed the reflection effect in galex  j0321@xmath84727 originally reported by @xcite and based on northern sky variability survey ( nsvs ) photometry .",
    "the observations also showed that both galex  j0321@xmath84727 and galex  j2349@xmath83844 are v2093 her type pulsating subdwarfs @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present spectroscopic and photometric observations of a sample of @xmath4-selected hot subdwarf stars with the aim of determining their binary properties .",
    "sections 2.1 and 2.2 present details of our spectroscopic observations , while section 2.3 present archival photometric time series . in section 3",
    "we present an analysis of stellar properties ( 3.1 ) , and of binary properties supplemented by our analysis of photometric time series ( 3.2 ) .",
    "finally , we present a review of the properties of known binaries comprising a hot subdwarf star , including the properties of the components ( section 4.1 ) , the population kinematics ( 4.2 ) , and the properties of some outstanding individual cases ( 4.3 ) , followed by a summary of the present work ( 4.4 ) .",
