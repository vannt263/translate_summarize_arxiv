    "giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) play a fundamental role in the evolution of a spiral galaxy .",
    "they represent the end result of the continual collection of diffuse gas into molecular form in the interstellar medium , some of it having been recycled from past generations of stars .",
    "gmcs are also the sites where the bulk of ongoing star formation in a galaxy then occurs .",
    "they can form from the atomic substrate , as evident in global views of other galaxies ( e.g.  m33  * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or perhaps from the assembly of smaller molecular clouds .",
    "how this occurs within our own galaxy remains unclear as the process has not yet been seen .",
    "models range from quasi - static self - gravitational collapse , for instance along magnetic field lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to transient phenomena such as the coalescence of clouds in converging flows in a turbulent medium .",
    "since stars appear to form almost as soon as molecular gas is present , then the rate of formation of gmcs is also instrumental in determining the star formation rate .",
    "furthermore , despite being molecular , forming clouds will not necessarily be evident through co line emission , normally the tracer used to delineate their locations .",
    "this is because in the low molecular column densities of clouds forming from the diffuse atomic medium far  uv radiation will dissociate the co , whereas self - shielding can allow h@xmath4 to exist ; i.e.  a pure h@xmath4 molecular cloud ( sometimes also known as  dark  h@xmath4 due to the absence of an emitting molecular species ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the carbon in such clouds can not be hidden , however , and will exist primarily in neutral form where it can emit through the [ ci ] lines at 492 and 809ghz ( 610 & @xmath5 m , respectively ) , or in singly - ionized form , emitting as [ cii ] 1.90thz ( @xmath6 m ) , or in both . in either case , its detection is difficult , for observations at these frequencies require exceedingly dry atmospheric conditions or airborne / space platforms .",
    "facilities able to map these species at good spectral and spatial resolution , and over the large areas of sky that may encompass the environs of forming giant molecular clouds , have not previously been available .",
    "we present the first data from a new facility at the summit of the antarctic plateau , ridge a @xcite .",
    "the 62 cm aperture high elevation antarctic terahertz ( heat ) telescope ( kulesa et al . 2014 , in preparation ) currently provides spectroscopic imaging in the 810ghz lines of co j=76 and [ ci ] j=21 , with upcoming capabilities at 1.46thz [ nii ] and 1.90thz [ cii ] .",
    "it can already map [ ci ] emission over significant regions of the galactic plane , and so be able to search for forming molecular clouds and `` dark '' h@xmath4 .",
    "the exceedingly low and stable columns of precipitable water vapor at ridge a ( falling below 100@xmath7 m for more than 25% of winter ; @xcite ) make this possible .",
    "we have identified a filament in [ ci ] in the g328 region that is also evident in molecular ( co ) and atomic ( hi ) survey data taken with similar resolution .",
    "the results of our mapping of this filament are the subject of this paper .",
    "[ cii ] emission has also been identified along a sightline near to this filament by the got c+ program using the _ herschel _ telescope .",
    "the observations are summarised in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] and the results presented in ",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "they are then discussed in  [ sec : discuss ] with reference to the physical characteristics of the g328 filament , a pdr model for its line emission , and the carbon abundance within it .",
    "the data presented here comes from three separate spectral line surveys of sub - mm [ ci ] , mm co and cm hi emission in the southern galactic plane .",
    "heat is imaging the [ ci ] 809.3ghz line ( @xmath8 ) from ridge a , antarctica , yielding data cubes with @xmath9 and 0.7km / s resolution .",
    "@xmath10co , @xmath11co and c@xmath12o j=10 emission lines ( 115.3 , 110.2 & 109.8ghz , respectively ) were imaged as part of the 22 m mopra southern galactic plane co survey @xcite , with @xmath13 and 0.1km / s resolution .",
    "the 1.420ghz hi line comes from archival data in the parkes ",
    "atca southern galactic plane survey ( the sgps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and provides @xmath9 and 3km / s resolution .",
    "the contiguous data set for these species covers @xmath14@xmath15 to @xmath16 , although the co and hi images presented here in fact cover a larger region , of @xmath17 to @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "[ ci ] and co emission extend over a velocity range from @xmath20 to 0km / s @xmath21 in the data cube , the hi from @xmath22 to @xmath23km / s .",
    "spatially , the emission from the three species across these velocity ranges covers the entire region mapped .",
    "a sinuous emission feature was identified in the co data cubes , extending @xmath24 in angular size and centred at @xmath25km / s , with a narrow spectral range of just 4km / s .",

    "it is also notable that the hi is evident as a depression in the level of the extended atomic emission found across the entire g328 region ( i.e.  hi self - absorption or hisa ) , whereas the co and [ ci ] emission are primarily confined to just the filament itself in this velocity range . also notable",

    "there also do not appear to be any ir sources that are clearly associated with the filament , as might be expected if star formation were active in it .",
    "figure  [ fig : contours ] shows the hi image overlaid with contours of the co and [ ci ] .",
    "it is clear that these features are closely related .",
    "the heat [ ci ] dataset so far spans only the nw portion of the filament ( the `` head '' ) .",
    "however , given the similarity of the co and [ ci ] here , both spectrally and in morphology , it seems likely that the [ ci ] emission will be co - extensive with the co along the rest of the filament .",
    "figure  [ fig : profiles ] presents profiles for the lines averaged over the head of the filament .",
    "we show both the entire spectrum along the sight line as well as zoomed into the velocity range for the g328 filament , for clarity .",
    "the co and [ ci ] are clearly similar for the filament ( i.e.  same line centre and narrow fwhm ) , but for hi this is evident as a dip in the profile , which extends considerably beyond the spectral limits shown .",
    "figure  [ fig : cuts ] shows a spatial cut perpendicular to the filament in the integrated flux images .",
    "the filament is narrow and shows similar structure in co and [ ci ] .",
    "then their profiles along this cut are virtually the same .",
    "] as for the velocity profiles , there is a dip in the hi flux across the filament .",
    "the reduction amounts to approx 40% of the flux level found either side of the filament .",
    "line parameters are then calculated for 3 different apertures associated with the filament .",
    "the first is for the integrated flux for its head , and the other two are for the peak pixels seen in the [ ci ] image . these apertures are defined in table  [ tab : apertures ] and their line fluxes are listed in table  [ tab : fluxes ] . @xmath10co",
    "optical depths are also calculated from the @xmath10co / @xmath11co flux ratio , @xmath29 ( i.e. @xmath30 with @xmath31 \\sim 50 $ ] appropriate to a galactocentric radius of @xmath32kpc ; the derived values are only mildly sensitive to its likely variation ",
    "see @xcite ) .",
    "the co optical depths are significant(@xmath33 ) and greatest at the brightest pixels .",
    "column densities for co , c and h are then given in table  [ tab : coldens ] .",
    "these are calculated using a standard excitation analysis from the upper level column density given by radiative transfer ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , with standard notation : @xmath34    the column density for the species is then determined from @xmath35    here @xmath36 is the partition function , taken to be @xmath37k ) for co , 4 for hi , and from fitting to the tabulated values in the cologne database for molecular spectroscopy ( cdms ) for [ ci ] .",
    "the principal assumptions made in these calculations are of a beam filling factor of unity and in the value of the excitation temperature , here taken to be @xmath38k .",
    "@xmath39 is determined for co as described above and the optically thin limit is assumed for c. can be calculated and is found to be @xmath40 , so this assumption is self - consistent . ]",
    "motivating the temperature assumption , in the pdr model we discuss in  [ sec : pdr ] the [ ci ] and co lines arise in regions of similar temperature of @xmath41k . also , combining the [ ci ] 809ghz flux with a low s / n spectrum for the 492ghz @xmath42[ci ] line obtained with the nanten2 telescope at the filament s peak ( glck et al .",
    "2014 , in preparation ) yields a similar value . changing @xmath43 by @xmath44k",
    "likewise changes @xmath45 by about one - third .",
    "the boltzmann factor applied to the 60k energy level of the 809 ghz [ ci ] line makes @xmath46 particularly sensitive to lower values of @xmath43 . for 10k",
    "it would increase by an order of magnitude ; however for 30k @xmath46 falls by only a half . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath43 were significantly less than 20k then the nanten2 492ghz flux would have been much higher , given the measured value for the 809ghz line .",
    "the range in the derived columns for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , considering all such likely variations in these parameters , does not alter the essential results that are given below .",
    "the column density of cold atomic gas is estimated from the hi self - absorption profiles following the method of @xcite and @xcite to determine the absorption optical depth .",
    "we use the difference in fluxes between the bottom of the absorption profile ( @xmath47 ) and its value if no absorption had occurred ( @xmath48 , obtained by interpolating across the line profile from the values either side ) to determine @xmath49 $ ] ( see table  [ tab : fluxes ] ) , where @xmath50 is the spin temperature and @xmath51 is the fraction of the hi emission assumed to originate from behind the filament ( we have also implicitly assumed that the background continuum brightness temperature is very much less than the line brightness temperature in deriving this formula ) .",
    "we take @xmath52k , intermediate between the value in the cold molecular gas ( @xmath41k ) and an upper limit equal to the lowest value found in the hi data cube over the entire filament ( @xmath53k ) . following the discussion in @xcite",
    ", @xmath51 is likely to be close to 1 for hisa to be prominent ( but note also that it has minimum value given by @xmath54 in the limit that @xmath55 ; for the values used here this is @xmath56 ) .",
    "the column of cold atomic gas in the filament is then given by @xmath57 and is listed in table  [ tab : coldens ] .",
    "for @xmath58(20k , 50k ) these columns should be multiplied by @xmath59 times , respectively .",
    "if only two - thirds of the hi emission was from behind the filament ( i.e. @xmath60 ) then the hi columns should be multiplied by a further factor of @xmath61 .    for c and co",
    "the derived columns are of order a few @xmath62 .",
    "it is clear that the average c and co abundances are comparable .",
    "their ratio is a few times higher than that found in the dense pdr of carina , where nanten2 measurements found @xmath63 \\sim 0.2 $ ] .    for h the total column in emission",
    "is found to be @xmath64 in the velocity range of the filament ( and so assumed to be at its distance ) .",
    "however this gas is extended over the whole field seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cicohi ] and so this column can not be directly associated with atomic gas around the filament , although its projected distance is only 1020pc away .",
    "the cold atomic gas is evident as the hisa and has a column estimated to be @xmath65 , though this figure could readily be increased by @xmath61 times , dependent upon the assumed value for @xmath50 , the background continuum and particularly the foreground hi contribution , as discussed above .    along a sightline at @xmath66",
    "the got c+ program with _",
    "herschel _ has detected [ cii ] emission in the same narrow velocity range as the co , [ ci ] and hi discussed above .",
    "this sightline does not intersect the g328 filament , and lies @xmath67 away from its head , in a region where [ ci ] emission is absent and the co emission diffuse and weak ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cicohi ] ) . the hi here , however , is seen in emission rather than absorption .",
    "thus , while this [ cii ] emission can not be used to determine the c@xmath68 column density associated with the filament , it does suggest that c@xmath68 emission is widespread and extends beyond the molecular cloud .",
    "the c@xmath68 column density at this position is estimated by langer et al .  to be several times @xmath69 , so comparable in magnitude to that of the co and c we have derived for the head .",
    "striking in the images is the long , sinuous nature of the filament ( @xmath70 in all the spectral features ) , together with its narrow 4 km / s line width along this entire length . the central emission velocity ( @xmath71km / s ) yields a kinematic distance of ( 5.2 , 9.2)kpc ( near , far - solutions ) and a galactocentric radius of 5.0kpc .",
    "based on the dip in the hi profile along its length we assume the near - distance .",
    "the line centre is constant to within 1km / s along the filament s length .",
    "this yields a size of @xmath72pc , with any velocity gradient or shear along it constrained to be @xmath73km / s / pc .",
    "this latter limit is comparable to the shear that would produced by galactic rotation over this distance .",
    "the mean co line flux over the length of the filament ( @xmath74 over @xmath75 ) is similar to that over its head ( see table  [ tab : apertures ] ) . applying the empirical conversion between flux and column ( @xmath76 $ ] ; ) to the integrated flux over the entire filament , and converting to a molecular mass yields @xmath77 ; i.e.  comparable to that expected for a low - mass gmc .",
    "this implies an average number density @xmath78 in the filament , given its size ( and assuming a depth comparable to its width ) .",
    "the co luminosity is @xmath79 .",
    "the fwhm of the co line of 4 km / s is greater than the thermal width for cold gas ( @xmath80 ) so presumably it is mildly turbulent .",
    "however any shear along its length is low , being @xmath81km / s over its 75pc .",
    "the absence of far  ir dust emission in the _ herschel _ images associated with the filament implies that the dust must be cold .",
    "assuming grain emissivities , @xmath82 , as given by , then for @xmath83k the fluxes would be , applying @xmath84 1000 , 400 & 150mjy / sr at 250 , 350 & 500@xmath7 m , respectively .",
    "these fluxes are comparable with the galactic background and so should be discernible in the _ herschel _ images . however , for @xmath85k they fall to 5030mjy / sr , and so would not readily be distinguished above the background .",
    "this implies an upper limit to the dust temperature of @xmath86k .",
    "the galactic background in the _ herschel _ images can also be used to obtain an upper limit for the dust luminosity ; we obtain @xmath87 , and correspondingly @xmath88 using the estimated molecular mass .",
    "these are strong limits ; if the dust emission from the filament was 20% of the background levels it would likely be discernible , tracing the outline of the filament in the _ herschel _ images . comparing to the values derived by @xcite and @xcite for @xmath89 for ir  quiet and non - h  ii region clouds ( i.e.  those lacking in massive star formation ) , this places the upper limit for the g328 filament at the lower end of the range these authors found , and similarly for the corresponding range found in @xmath90 vs. @xmath91 .",
    "the g328 filament is thus underluminous compared to ir - quiet gmcs , suggesting that active star formation has not yet commenced .",
    "we note that these previous studies used clouds that were bright enough to be seen by _ iras _ against the galactic background and thus our @xmath89 ratio represents an unbiased and perhaps more representative value for a quiescent gmc .",
    "we have examined a range of cloud properties using a modified form of the @xcite photodissociation region code to calculate column densities and line emission to compare with the data .",
    "the model consists of a slab of gas illuminated by the interstellar radiation field on two sides .",
    "the gas temperature and the abundances of atomic / molecular species are calculated as a function of optical depth , @xmath92 , under the assumptions of thermal balance , chemical equilibrium and constant thermal pressure .",
    "we have made a simple approximation to include @xmath93 line transfer by assuming a constant @xmath94 abundance ratio of 50 .",
    "for details on the chemistry and thermal processes we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . while not intended as a comprehensive attempt to fit the data , it has provided a representative model which approximates the observations for aperture # 2 .",
    "the parameters and results are shown in table  [ tab : pdrmodel ] .",
    "this model adopts an interstellar radiation field of @xmath95 ( with @xmath96 incident on each side ; @xmath97 is the interstellar field strength in units of habing fields ; @xcite ) .",
    "this field is roughly consistent with interstellar fields expected at a galactocentric radius of 5kpc @xcite .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the co and [ ci ] flux results are not strongly dependent on @xmath97 , as discussed in @xcite , because stronger fields drive the c to co transition deeper into the cloud , where the temperature is lower than at the surface .",
    "higher fields will increase the c@xmath68 1.9thz flux , however .",
    "the model shown in table  [ tab : pdrmodel ] adopts a primary cosmic ray ionization rate of @xmath98 , consistent with rates for low column density diffuse clouds determined from observations of h@xmath99 @xcite , oh@xmath68 and h@xmath100o@xmath68 @xcite .",
    "there is some evidence that the ionization rate is depth dependent in clouds , varying from @xmath101 in low @xmath92 clouds to values of @xmath102 in the centers of molecular clouds .",
    "we present in table  [ tab : pdrmodel ] a model with the high cosmic ray rate , but an equally good fit to the data can be obtained with the low cosmic ray rate .",
    "we find that the low cosmic ray rate produces a higher fraction of the total co cooling in the j=10 line , because the co gas is cooler .    the observed",
    "co j=10 luminosity of the whole filament is of order 0.1 l@xmath103 . in the pdr models",
    ", this corresponds to a total co luminosity of the cloud of 36l@xmath103 , depending on the cosmic ray rate .",
    "for the low cosmic ray rate , the total co cooling is 3l@xmath103 and most of the heating of the co is provided by the fuv radiation at intermediate depths into the cloud . for the high cosmic ray rate",
    "the total co cooling is 6l@xmath103 , of which about half the heating is provided by the fuv radiation at intermediate depths and half by cosmic rays distributed through the entire co region .",
    "the pdr models that fit the data have a total cloud optical depth of @xmath104  mags .  and",
    "the interior gas temperature where co 10 becomes optically thick is @xmath105 k with an @xmath106 density of 650 @xmath107 .",
    "note , however , that the model line fluxes are approximately twice that observed indicating that the beam filling factor is @xmath108 .",
    "for this beam filling factor , the estimated columns in table  [ tab : coldens ] would be multiplied by a factor of @xmath109 . with this correction , the model column densities and line fluxes agree with observations to within a factor of 2 .",
    "we also provide estimates for the c 492 ghz and @xmath110 1.90 thz transitions .",
    "the models predict overlapping c@xmath68 , c and co emission zones but their peaks are separated by @xmath111 mags . , equivalent to @xmath108pc , which is not resolvable at the resolution of the heat telescope at 809ghz ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cuts ] ) , but should begin to be discernible were it at the resolution of the mopra dataset .",
    "we also note that the model incident field is @xmath96 .",
    "this field produces dust temperatures at the surface of @xmath112 k for silicates and @xmath113 k for carbonaceous grains @xcite .",
    "however , the the bulk of radiation field is absorbed , and the dust emission is produced at greater depth , where the field strength is lower . at @xmath114",
    "the grain temperatures drop to 15 k and 20 k for silicates and carbonaceous grains respectively .",
    "the model dust temperatures are marginally within the limits set by the _ herschel _ observations .      applying the empirical @xmath115 factor to the peak co flux and comparing to the columns for co and c yields [ c / h ] @xmath116 , about half of the measured gas - phase abundance of @xmath117 @xcite in diffuse gas .",
    "the @xmath110 column density is expected to contribute only an additional 10% to the total .",
    "this discrepancy between the estimated carbon abundances from our observations , and those measured in the diffuse gas and used in models , might simply arise from the inadequacy of using the x  factor conversion to provide the total column .",
    "on the other hand , low carbon abundances ( e.g.  [ co / h ] @xmath118 ) have been previously adopted in analysis of co observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to match the data , suggesting that most of the non - refractory carbon is hidden is some form as yet undetected . the model in table  [ tab : pdrmodel ]",
    "is shown only for representational purposes and is not a best fit from an exhaustive search of model parameter space .",
    "however it demonstrates that reasonable fits can be obtained without depleting the gas phase carbon from the observed diffuse cloud values .",
    "there is no `` missing carbon '' in these models , with the gas phase carbon ( @xmath117 in abundance relative to h nuclei ) contained in c@xmath68 at the surface , in c at intermediate depth , and then as co from about @xmath119 to the center of the cloud .",
    "most of the h nuclei are in the co zone , so the previous observations which ratio the co column to the h nuclei column and find a few @xmath120 can not be explained by additional h column in the non - co zone .",
    "our model explains the observed co and ci intensities and predicts c@xmath68 1.9thz intensities comparable to those observed by got c+ in a nearby line of sight .",
    "the models include freeze - out of atomic carbon and carbon molecules onto grain surfaces using the formalism discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is possible that some of the co may be lost from the gas phase due to co ice formation . for the model presented in table  [ tab : pdrmodel ] , at cloud center about 40% of the carbon is in co ice .",
    "however , the freeze - out zone extends for only a short column in @xmath92 and the column density of co ice amounts to only @xmath121% of the co gas - phase column density .",
    "it is likely that there exists and extended , low density atomic halo around the g328 molecular filament , as evident through the hi emission that surrounds it , together with the c@xmath68 emission detected along the got c+ sightline .",
    "the filament would be expected to connect to the ambient ism .",
    "however the presence of such an extended halo will have little affect on the pdr model we have presented , as it would not contribute either co or [ ci ] line emission .",
    "it would , however , provide low density c@xmath68 gas that extends much further from the filament than the constant thermal pressure assumption inherent in our pdr model allows for .",
    "mapping of the extended [ cii ] emission will be necessary to address such questions regarding the connection of the molecular to atomic mediums , as well as the possible presence of `` dark '' molecular gas , where co is not present and the carbon predominantly in the form of c@xmath68 .",
    "we have found a quiescent , filamentary molecular cloud in the g328 region , situated about 5kpc from the sun and extending @xmath72pc , with a mass @xmath2 , comparable to that of a low mass gmc .",
    "the filament is evident in co , [ ci ] and in hi self - absorption .",
    "the line width is small , @xmath122km / s along its length , and no velocity gradient is discernible . over the sightline through the cloud the average abundance of atomic carbon is similar to that of carbon in its molecular form ( i.e.  co ) .",
    "the filament is not discernible in far ",
    "ir continuum images , and the flux limits imply that the dust must be cold , @xmath86k . the limits on its luminosity place it at the low end of the range in @xmath89 previously found for ir - quiet gmcs .",
    "no clear evidence for star formation in the filament can be seen in the ir images , consistent with no significant internal heating .",
    "the molecular cloud is thus cold and has limited internal turbulence .",
    "we speculate that this filament represents a gmc that has recently formed , or indeed may still be in the process of forming .",
    "star formation has not yet progressed far within it , and there are no , or limited , sources of turbulent energy injection into the gas .",
    "this hypothesis can be tested through further wide - field thz spectral imaging , in both the [ cii ] 158@xmath7 m ( 1.90 thz ) line and the two [ ci ] lines .",
    "[ cii ] would be expected to also show a similar structure to the co and [ ci ] . as the gas transitions from atomic to molecular form a high ratio of c@xmath68 and c to co is expected , for the external far ",
    "uv radiation field will limit the amount of gas that can exist as co until sufficient column density has been built up to shield it from dissociating radiation .",
    "it would be of particular interest to determine whether the c and c@xmath68 associated with the filament has a more extended distribution than the co as this scenario would suggest .",
    "it is first planned to upgrade heat to operate at 1.9thz to measure the extended c@xmath68 .",
    "then a 5 m diameter thz telescope , such as the proposed date5 for dome a in antarctica , and the 0.8 m balloon - borne sto-2 , to be launched from mcmurdo station in antarctica , in late 2015 , would provide similar resolution to the co in the [ ci ] and [ cii ] lines , accordingly , allowing one to examine this question further .",
