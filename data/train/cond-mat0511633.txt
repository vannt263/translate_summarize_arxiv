    "recent experiments @xcite on a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in weak magnetic fields show that these systems have an almost vanishing longitudinal resistivity when the microwave frequency @xmath0 is ( up to an additive constant ) approximately a multiple of the cyclotron frequency .",
    "this triggered a number of theoretical and experimental papers @xcite . as is shown in ref .",
    ", zero resistance states can be due to a negative microscopic diagonal conductivity .",
    "there are two mechanisms producing negative microscopic longitudinal conductivity : the first mechanism , known as _ displacement mechanism _",
    ", relies on disorder - assisted absorption and emission of microwaves @xcite .",
    "depending on the detuning @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the cyclotron frequency , the displacement of the electrons is preferentially in or against the direction of the applied _ dc _ field .",
    "an alternative mechanism , known as _ distribution function mechanism _",
    ", relies on the fact that microwave absorption leads to a change in the electronic distribution function , which can result in a negative photoconductivity @xcite .",
    "detailed calculations within the self - consistent born approximation suggest that the latter mechanism is larger by a factor @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the inelastic relaxation time and @xmath5 the single particle scattering time in the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "as is well known , the influence of a unidirectional periodic potential on a 2deg in a homogeneous magnetic field leads to transport anisotropies @xcite as well as commensurability oscillations in the resistivity known as weiss oscillations @xcite . in such systems",
    "the landau level broadening is due to the periodic modulation induced by the additional potential . in a foregoing paper @xcite",
    ", we studied the dark conductivities as well as the microwave - induced photoconductivities for these systems using a fermi s golden rule approach which goes back to titeica in ref . .",
    "the _ dc _ response of the microwave - driven system in the presence of a modulation potential is similar to the magnetoresistivity response of a 2deg to surface acoustic waves @xcite .",
    "it is clear that one can calculate the current resulting from a perturbation of the electron system by calculating the transition rates .",
    "it is easy to establish a current formula from the transition rates between eigenstates when knowing their position expectation values @xcite . within the lowest order approximation",
    ", we can calculate these transition rates by the help of fermi s golden rule . without microwave field ,",
    "one can calculate the dark conductivity using the impurity potential as a perturbation . under microwave irradiation ,",
    "the microwave operator acts as an additional perturbation .    in ref .",
    ", we carried out a calculation of the dark and the photoconductivity to the most obvious case where the periodic modulation wave length @xmath6 of the unidirectional field is small compared to the cyclotron radius @xmath7 and additional small to the inverse of the correlation length @xmath8 times the square of the magnetic length , i.e. @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore we restricted us to temperatures @xmath10 large with respect to the landau level width , @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the index of the topmost filled landau level .",
    "furthermore , we limited our calculation to the case that the amplitude of the unidirectional modulation potential @xmath13 is smaller than @xmath2 such that we were able to restrict ourselves to first order perturbation theory in @xmath13 .",
    "finally , we discussed explicitly the conductivities for the case @xmath14 which is known to be the dominant regime for zero resistance states .",
    "we obtained in ref . that the photocurrent parallel to the direction of the wavevector of the unidirectional field is governed by the distribution function mechanism , which is larger than the contribution of the displacement mechanism by a factor @xmath3 . in the perpendicular direction",
    ", we find a strong enhancement of the displacement mechanism photocurrent such that in this case both contributions are of the same order . in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "we calculated the various conductivities in the regime @xmath15 which , experimentally , for the case without periodic modulation potential , has shown a strong suppression of the shubnikov de - haas oscillations @xcite , in accordance with our calculation .",
    "further theoretical work on this subject was done in @xcite .",
    "there are other interesting applications of our formalism .",
    "the above system can be used to model different types of anisotropic quantum hall systems , e.g. the striped state system @xcite , which shows a more complex unidirectional modulation even without the application of a modulation potential . in the striped state",
    ", the modulation has a wavelength @xmath16 .",
    "the available transport experiments in this regime were carried out at temperatures much smaller than the landau level spacing @xcite , but without microwave irradiation .",
    "we argue in this paper that interesting effects , among which zero resistance states , can arise when the striped system is irradiated by microwaves .",
    "motivated by the physics of the striped state , we first calculate the various conductivities for the case @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we obtain a strong filling fraction dependence of these conductivities , except for the displacement mechanism contribution in the perpendicular direction .",
    "in addition , we discuss the dark conductivity and the photoconductivities in the striped state regime @xmath16 and obtain agreement of the _ dc _ ( dark ) conductivity in the striped state with prior calculations .    in our calculations in ref .",
    "we assumed that the impurity contribution to the landau level band width is negligible in comparison to the contribution from the modulation potential .",
    "this is in contrast to the experimentally realized system without unidirectional periodic modulation where the band width has its origin in impurity scattering .",
    "the band structure in this system depends mainly on the strength of the magnetic field . for weak magnetic fields ,",
    "the system has highly overlapping landau levels , while for strong magnetic fields , the landau levels are well separated . by a variation of the modulation potential amplitude @xmath13  which is possible in the usual weiss oscillation experiments by tuning the grid potential @xcite  it is possible to reach the overlapping landau level regime without changing the magnetic field and thus the effective filling fraction .",
    "it is physically plausible that the conductivity expressions parallel to the modulation potential should be in accordance to the system without unidirectional modulation given e.g. in ref .",
    "up to numbers .",
    "this was shown explicitly in ref .",
    "for the non - overlapping landau level regime , i.e. @xmath19 . in this paper",
    "we show the same for the highly overlapping landau level regime , i.e. @xmath20 .",
    "we obtain also an oscillating photoconductivity but the explicit frequency dependence differ from the ones without modulation potential .    for calculating the various conductivities in the case",
    "@xmath21 we have to discuss the single particle eigenvalue problem of an electron in a unidirectional periodic potential and a homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "this was done in ref . by solving the eigenvalue problem in first order perturbation theory in the oscillating potential strength , which is appropriate for @xmath22 . in this paper",
    ", we solve the eigenvalue problem without any restrictions to the relation between @xmath23 and @xmath24 by discussing the wkb approximation of this eigenvalue problem .",
    "these results are used in section vi to calculate the conductivities for the case @xmath25 .",
    "we chose to provide a self - contained summary of all main results and a discussion of their implications relevant to experiments in the next section of this paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section ii contains a summary of our results . in section iii",
    "we calculate the various dark and photoconductivities for the distribution function and the displacement mechanism in the case where @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in section",

    "we discuss in section vi the dark as well as the photoconductivites for the case @xmath21 .",
    "the derivations of sections iii - vi were carried out in the frequency regime @xmath14 and for a linearly polarized microwave field in @xmath30-direction . in section vii , we generalize these result to an arbitrary microwave field of frequency @xmath31 .",

    "some technical details are deferred to a number of appendices . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we use the convention @xmath32 .",
    "for clarity we point out once more that the explicit conductivity formulas of sections iii - vi are only valid for @xmath14 and @xmath33 polarization .",
    "we assume that the landau level bandwidth due to impurity scattering is much smaller than the bandwidth due to the modulation potential .",
