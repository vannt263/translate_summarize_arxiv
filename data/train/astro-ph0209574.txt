    "recently brocato et al . ( 1999 ) discussed the presence of a tilt of the order of @xmath0 in the hb morphology of the intermediate metallicity globular cluster ngc 6362 [ @xmath1 is the magnitude difference between the top of the blue hb and the fainter magnitude reached by the red hb ( rhb ) ] . on the other hand , much larger tilts ( @xmath2 ) are observed in the metal rich clusters ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 of the inner milky way ( rich et al .",
    "1997 ; sweigart and catelan 1998 ) .    in the present work we investigate evolutionary predictions concerning the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of metal rich hb stars and arguments that can constraint possible explanations of this not yet understood feature .",
    "we computed zero - age horizontal branch ( zahb ) by adopting @xmath3 and @xmath4 as representative of `` metal rich '' clusters like 47 tuc , and @xmath5 as a safe upper limit for globular cluster metallicities .",
    "as expected , the effective temperature of rhb stars depends on the mixing length assumption : at any given temperature , the luminosity of the red - zahb increases when the mixing length increases . at higher metallicities",
    "the hb locus moves toward lower effective temperatures and rhb stars are increasingly affected by external convection .",
    "canonical zahbs with metallicity larger than @xmath6=-1 $ ] should be affected by a tilt , that increases by : @xmath7 increasing the metallicity ; and @xmath8 decreasing the mixing length value .",
    "the larger reasonable slope is : @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 , unfortunately not large enough to account for the observed tilt .",
    "un - canonical frameworks do not seem to enlighten the problem ( raimondo et al .",
    "the cmds of ngc 6441 and ngc 6388 ( fig .",
    "1 ) show that the lower envelope of the hb is sloped as @xmath12 .",
    "we tried to explain this feature as a result of _ differential reddening _ or as due to a peculiar _",
    "metallicity spread_. our attempts were not conclusively successful ( raimondo et al . 2002 ) .",
    "moreover , if one analyzes the cmds of the metal rich globular clusters in the padova hst snapshot data - base ( piotto et al .",
    "2002 ) it can be seen ( fig .",
    "1 ) that _ the clusters more metal rich than 47 tuc show a tilted rhb _ with a slope @xmath13 .",
    "the large tilt of the rhb of ngc 6441 and ngc 6388 seems to be a feature observed in many metal rich clusters . up to now , a fully satisfactory explanation is not yet found .",
    "more precise observations ( i.e. flames@vlt ) are urgently needed to properly constraint our understanding of metal rich stellar systems ."
