    "in addition to their structural role of forming the exterior frames of the cell and its interior organelles and vesicles , lipid bilayers act as the host and regulator of many biophysical and biochemical reactions@xcite .",
    "inter- and intra - cellular recognition and transport , adhesion , regulation of ion concentrations , and energy conversion , are but a few of the processes taking place at the membrane .",
    "these tasks are carried out by a variety of proteins , glycolipids , and other macromolecules that move through the many different lipids that make up the bilayer .",
    "the resulting membrane is thus far from uniform ; there are even examples in which inhomogeneities occur on a larger scale , e.g. domains of phase separated lipids or two - dimensional protein assemblies . in modeling the physical properties of the cell , it is thus essential to have a good understanding of the interactions between inclusions in fluid membranes .",
    "the pursuit of `` biologically inspired '' materials , which do not posses the full complexity of their natural counterparts , yet retain some of their useful features , is quite active .",
    "artificial protein assemblies within lipid membranes are now routinely produced in the laboratory@xcite .",
    "such model - membrane systems have potential applications for targeted drug delivery and may also lead to novel applications such as nano - scale pumps , templates , functionalized interfaces , and chemical reactors .",
    "the appropriate design of such artificial membranes again requires an understanding of how inclusions modify the physical properties of the bilayer , and how the membrane in turn contributes to the interactions between inclusions .",
    "the forces between the inclusions can be broadly subdivided into two categories@xcite .",
    "the first category includes interactions that are present in the bulk of the solvent .",
    "they include the van der waals interaction , which falls off with separation @xmath5 as @xmath6 at long distances . the coulomb interaction is strongly screened under physiological conditions .",
    "( typical ion concentrations are a few hundred millimolar , which give a screening length of less than 10  . ) hydration and structural forces are also short - ranged .",
    "the second category includes interactions which are mediated by the membrane itself : the inclusion disturbs the lipid bilayer and this disturbance propagates to neighboring inclusions ( c.f . @xcite and references therein ) . when macroscopic thermal fluctuations are unimportant ( we refer to this case as @xmath7 ) , the resulting interactions tend to be short - ranged . for example , if in the region around an inclusion the membrane is forced to deviate from its preferred thickness ( @xmath8 ) , the resulting disturbance in the bilayer decays ( heals ) over a length of order this thickness @xcite .",
    "nearby inclusions then feel an interaction that falls off exponentially with this characteristic length .",
    "there are also long - range interactions that are mediated by the membrane . to describe such interactions",
    ", it should be possible to neglect the microscopic properties of the membrane , and its molecular lipid bilayer structure , and focus on its macroscopic properties . in the long - distance limit ,",
    "the membrane is well - described by the elastic hamiltonian@xcite , @xmath9,\\label{chh}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the surface area element , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the mean and gaussian curvatures respectively .",
    "the elastic properties of the surface are then described by the tension @xmath13 , and the bending rigidities @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "a finite surface tension is in general the strongest coupling in eq.([chh ] ) and dominates the bending terms at long wavelengths .",
    "this term is present for films on a frame , interfaces at short distances , and possibly membranes subject to osmotic pressure differences between their interior and exterior . on the other hand , for unstressed vesicles ,",
    "the surface tension is quite small , and may be neglected at wavelengths well below the size of the vesicle @xcite . in this case , the energy cost of fluctuations is controlled by the rigidity terms . for simplicity we shall refer to surface tension dominated surfaces as films , and to rigidity controlled ones as membranes .    the long - range interactions between inclusions in a membrane that result from eq.([chh ] )",
    "were examined in ref.@xcite .",
    "if the inclusions are asymmetric across the bilayer and impose a local curvature , even at @xmath7 , there is a long - ranged repulsive interaction that falls off with distance as @xmath0 .",
    "the energy scale of this interaction is set by @xmath14 and @xmath15 . on the other hand , if thermal fluctuations of the membrane are included ( @xmath16 ) , there is a @xmath0 interaction for _ generic _ inclusions .",
    "the only requirement is that the rigidity of the inclusion differs from that of the ambient membrane@xcite .",
    "in particular , the interaction is attractive if the inclusions are stiffer than the membrane .",
    "the magnitude of this fluctuation  induced interaction is set by @xmath17 , and is totally independent of the rigidities @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( @xcite , see also appendix [ asph ] ) .    in a recent report ,",
    "we considered the dependence of the fluctuation  induced ( @xmath18 ) interaction between rod - like inclusions on their orientations@xcite .",
    "the rods are assumed to be sufficiently rigid so that they do not deform coherently with the underlying membrane .",
    "they can thus only perform rigid translations and rotations while remaining attached to the surface . as a result ,",
    "the fluctuations of the membrane are constrained , having to vanish at the boundaries of the rods .",
    "consider the situation depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , with two rods of lengths @xmath19 and @xmath20 at a separation @xmath21 . for fluctuating films ( @xmath22 )",

    "this angular dependence is actually the _ square _ of that of a dipole - dipole interaction in two dimensions , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 as the dipole strengths .",
    "the fluctuation - induced interaction on a membrane ( @xmath24 ) is very similar and given by @xmath25+o\\left(1/r^6\\right).\\ ] ] the orientational dependence is the _ square _ of a quadrupole ",
    "quadrupole interaction , with the unusual property of being minimized for both parallel and perpendicular orientations of the rods .",
    "note that the strength of the interaction is the same in both cases .",
    "the above fluctuation - induced interactions decay less rapidly at large distances than van der waals forces and may play an important role in aligning asymmetric inclusions in biomembranes . since orientational correlations are often easier to measure than forces , this result may also be useful as a probe of the fluctuation - induced interaction .",
    "finally , this interaction could give rise to novel two - dimensional structures for collections of rodlike molecules .",
    "in particular , the resemblance of the orientational part of the interaction to dipolar forces suggests that a suitable way to minimize the energy of a collection of rods is to form them into chains .",
    "( if the rods are not colinear , the interactions can not be minimized simultaneously . )",
    "such chain - like structures are observed for ferromagnetic particles controlled by similar forces@xcite .    in this article",
    "we provide the calculational details that lead to the above results .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "due to its richer complexity , the detailed calculation for the force between rods on membranes is presented first in sec.[smemb ] . the corresponding calculation for films",

    ", the membrane undergoes only small fluctuations about a flat state .",
    "we may then parametrize the membrane surface with a height function @xmath28 and approximate the full coordinate - invariant hamiltonian of eq.([chh ] ) by the quadratic form @xmath29 since we assume @xmath26 is large ( compared with @xmath5 and @xmath30 ) , we denote the ( finite but large ) reference plane by @xmath31 .",

    "[ fig1 ] , where two rigid , rod - like objects , are attached to the membrane .",

    "we shall now discuss some general aspects of the fluctuation - induced interactions in eqs.([film ] ) and ( [ memb ] ) .",
    "the magnitude of the interaction is solely determined by @xmath17 and is independent of the tension and rigidity coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "thus the effect persists even for rather stiff membranes with @xmath116 .",
    "the only assumption is that the inclusions are much more rigid than the embedding surface , thus limiting its fluctuations in their neighborhood .    for both membranes and films",

    "this is a general feature of fluctuation - induced forces , including the ( finite @xmath117 ) van der waals interactions , which in @xmath26 dimensions fall off as @xmath118 .",
    "since the direct van der waals interactions between inclusions still fall off as @xmath6 , the forces mediated through the two - dimensional surface will always asymptotically dominate .",
    "of course the dimensional dependence of @xmath119 is canceled by a product of lengths in the numerator . for spherical inclusions ,",
    "this is given by the product of two inclusion areas ( see ref.@xcite and appendix [ asph ] ) and for rods by the product of the squares of their lengths .",
    "presumably , for general shapes , there is a formula that interpolates between these two limits .",
    "another potential extension is to a polymer floating on a membrane .",
    "the interplay between the elasticity and shapes of a polymer and membrane , neglecting membrane fluctuations , have been examined in @xcite ; an extension to the case of a fluctuating membrane has also recently appeared@xcite .",
    "there is also interesting behavior in the opposite limit of @xmath120 for the interaction between two parallel semiflexible polymers@xcite .",
    "finally , the most interesting aspect of our calculation is the orientational dependence of the force .",
    "this is most easily discussed for the film , where an intermediate stage involves calculating the angular dependence of a dipole - dipole interaction , which is subsequently squared .",
    "the final angular dependence is thus that of _ squared dipolar interactions_. similarly , the result for the membrane corresponds to _ squared quadrupolar interactions_. the minimal - energy orientations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ; note there is a large degeneracy .",
    "we also note that these interactions can not be obtained by adding two - body potentials on the rods : to find the orientational dependence of additive forces , let us consider an interaction @xmath121 , between any two infinitesimal segments of two rods of length @xmath122 at a distance @xmath123 . expanding @xmath124 , and integrating over the two rods , leads to the interaction @xmath125",
    "note that the angular dependence is now completely different , and minimized when the two rods are parallel to their axis of separation .",
    "presumably both interactions are present for rods of finite thickness ; the additive interaction is proportional to @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the thickness .",
    "the previously calculated interactions are thus larger by a factor proportional to @xmath128 and should dominate at large separations .    the unusual dependence on orientation in eqs.([film ] ) and ( [ memb ] ) could lead to new types of orientational ordering in ensembles of rod - shaped particles . of course , due to the non - additive nature of the forces , the fluctuation - induced interaction should be calculated separately for each arrangement . however",
    ", a cursory examination suggests that three - body and higher order interactions fall off with separation as @xmath6 .",
    "thus for @xmath123 , a collection of rods can be treated as if they interact through additive pair potentials .",
    "it is amusing to examine the minimum of such an interaction for three rods placed on the vertices of an equilateral triangle .",
    "one possible equilibrium configuration is a three arm star with the relative angles of @xmath129 between the rods .",
    "interestingly , this so - called `` triskelion '' structure is indeed formed by three rod - like `` clathrin '' proteins@xcite .",
    "( another stable configuration has each rod parallel to the corresponding side of the equilateral triangle . )",
    "of course , given the relative proximity of the three proteins , it is not clearthat the asymptotic interactions of eq.([memb ] ) are applicable to this case .",
    "another generic aspect of dipole and quadrupolar interactions is that they are frustrated ( i.e. can not be simultaneously minimized with respect to the orientations ) if the rod centers are not aligned .",
    "there may thus be an overall tendency to arrange rod shaped molecules into chains .",
    "( naturally this effect competes with the tendency to aggregate the inclusions together . )",
    "we hope that the orientational dependent interactions calculated in this paper will provide a fresh perspective on the behavior of inclusions in biological membranes .",
