    "in many cosmic systems containing jets , e.g. , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , stellar mass black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxrbs ) , and young stellar objects , the presence of an accretion disk is inferred from observations .",
    "one of the prominent theories of jet production asserts that the jet plasma is propelled by magnetic field lines that thread the accretion disk ( and perhaps , in agns and bhxrbs , the black hole ) and are twisted by differential rotation @xcite .",
    "this suggests that any relations observed between events in the accretion disk and those in the jet can be used to characterize the disk - jet connection and therefore to constrain models of jet formation . in bhxrbs ,",
    "the connection between accretion state and events in the jet is well - established . in these objects ,",
    "transitions to high - soft x - ray states are associated with the emergence of very bright features that proceed to propagate down the radio jet @xcite .",
    "observations related to the disk - jet connection in agns are complicated , since a single agn usually does not show the entire range of properties that we wish to analyze .",
    "for example , in seyfert galaxies , most of the observed x - ray ( and optical ) emission is generated in the accretion disk - corona region , but their radio jets tend to be weak and non - relativistic ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "on the other hand , in radio - loud agns with strong , highly variable nonthermal radiation ( blazars ) , the doppler beamed emission from the jet at most wavelengths masks the thermal emission from the accretion disk and its nearby regions .",
    "the radio galaxies and provide an excellent opportunity to study the relationship between events in the accretion disk and those in the jet . at optical and x - ray frequencies ,",
    "their properties are similar to seyfert galaxies , e.g. , the presence of strong broad emission lines in the optical band @xcite , and an iron emission line in the x - ray spectrum @xcite , while at centimeter and millimeter wavelengths their emission is dominated by a bright relativistic jet .",
    "nevertheless , the source of the optical continuum emission in radio galaxies is not well - known .",
    "for example , it may be blackbody emission from the accretion disk @xcite or synchrotron radiation from the jet .",
    "an accretion disk - jet connection in agns has been suggested by @xcite . during @xmath23 yr of monitoring of the radio galaxy 3c  120 ( 1997 to 2000 ) ,",
    "each of four dips in the x - ray flux , accompanied by spectral hardening , preceded the appearance of a bright knot moving down the radio jet at a superluminal apparent speed . using similar , but more extensive , multi - frequency monitoring observations of this object between 2002 and 2007 at x - ray ( 2.410 kev ) and radio ( 37 ghz ) wave bands as well as vlba images at 43 ghz",
    ", @xcite established an unambiguous connection between events in the accretion disk and jet .",
    "they showed that , during this interval , the x - ray and 37 ghz variations are anti - correlated , with the x - ray variations leading those in the radio by @xmath2120 days .",
    "furthermore , nearly every x - ray dip is followed by the ejection of a new knot in the vlba images .",
    "these findings imply that a decrease in the x - ray production is linked with increased speed in the jet flow , causing a shock wave to form and propagate downstream , appearing as a knot of bright emission in the jet . in 3c  120",
    ", the presence of an x - ray fe emission line implies that most of the x - rays are produced in the accretion disk region .",
    "therefore , the above pattern is strong evidence for a disk - jet connection .    in this work , we present the results of extensive multi - frequency monitoring of 3c  111 between 2004 and 2009 at x - ray energies ( 2.410 kev ) , optical @xmath0 band , and radio frequencies 14.5 , 37 , and 230 ghz , as well as imaging with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) at 43 ghz .",
    "we use these data to investigate the presence of a disk - jet connection similar to that in 3c  120 .",
    "3c  111 is a relatively nearby ( @xmath3 ) broad - line radio galaxy ( blrg ) @xcite .",
    "it is classified as a fanaroff - riley class ii",
    "( fr ii ) radio galaxy @xcite containing two radio lobes with hot spots and a single - sided jet @xcite . at radio frequencies",
    ", 3c  111 has blazar - like behavior , although the jet lies at an angle @xmath2@xmath4 to our line of sight @xcite , significantly greater than is the case for typical blazars .",
    "the counter - jet is too faint to detect , presumably because of doppler de - boosting .",
    "3c  111 exhibits the brightest compact radio core at cm / mm wavelengths of all fr ii radio galaxies and a blazar - like spectral energy distribution @xcite .",
    "it was one of the first radio galaxies in which superluminal motion was detected @xcite ; knots are ejected 1 - 2 times per year with typical apparent speeds of @xmath5-@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that part of the @xmath7-ray emission from the egret source 3eg j0416 + 3650 is associated with 3c  111 , and integration over the first 11 months of observations with the large area telescope of the _ fermi _ space telescope detected 3c  111 at a rather low flux level , @xmath8 phot @xmath9 s@xmath10 at energies exceeding 1 gev @xcite . at optical and x - ray frequencies ,",
    "3c  111 possesses properties similar to seyfert galaxies and bhxrbs .",
    "it has a prominent iron emission line at a rest energy of 6.4 kev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that most of the x - rays are produced in the immediate environs of the accretion disk : the corona , a hot wind , or the base of the jet @xcite .",
    "power spectral density ( psd ) analysis is a common technique to characterize time variability , which in turn is a powerful diagnostic of the geometry and physics of the accretion disk , corona , and jet .",
    "the psd corresponds to the power in the variability of emission as a function of timescale . @xcite and @xcite found that the x - ray psd of 3c  120 can be fit by a piece - wise power law , with a slope that steepens above a break frequency .",
    "this property of 3c  120 is similar to seyfert galaxies and bhxrbs , although in many cases the psds of the latter have more than one break , as well as sharp peaks representing quasi - periodic oscillations .",
    "the psd break frequency in bhxrbs and seyfert galaxies scales inversely with the mass of the black hole @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the break frequency and bh mass are inversely related over a range of bh masses from @xmath11 to @xmath12 , and that , for a given black hole mass , the break frequency also increases with higher accretion rate ( @xmath13 ) .",

    "we analyze the x - ray and radio light curves as well as the sequence of vlba images to test whether the x - ray dips and ejection of new radio knots in the pc scale jet are temporally related , as is the case in 3c 120 . in order to investigate the source of optical emission in 3c  111",

    "table  [ data ] summarizes the intervals of monitoring at different frequencies for each of the three wave bands in our data set .",
    "we term the entire light curve `` monitor data '' ; shorter segments of more intense monitoring are described below .",
    "the x - ray light curves are based on observations of 3c  111 with the pca detector of the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ from 2004 march to 2010 april , with typical exposure times of 1 - 2 ks . for each exposure , we used routines from the x - ray data analysis software ftools and the program xspec version 11.6 to calculate and subtract the standard x - ray background model for the faint sources from the data and to fit the x - ray spectrum from 2.4 to 10 kev as a power law with low - energy photoelectric absorption by intervening gas in our galaxy . for the latter , we used a hydrogen column density of @xmath18 atoms @xmath9 .",
    "this value of the absorbing column was determined by @xcite by analyzing the x - ray spectrum of 3c 111 with data from the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( asca)_. using observations from _ xmm - newton _ , @xcite have also obtained a value close to this . it should be noted that a giant molecular cloud is present in the foreground of 3c 111 @xcite and it contributes significantly to the optical to x - ray extinction of emission received from 3c 111 .    the sampling of the x - ray flux varied .",
    "normally , observations were made 2 - 3 times per week except during 8-week intervals each year when the radio galaxy is too close to the sun s celestial position to observe safely . in order to sample shorter - term variations , between 2006 november and 2007 january we obtained , on average , four measurements per day for almost two months .",
    "we refer to these observations as the `` medium '' data .",
    "our monitoring program also contains an interval from 2008 september to 2008 december when we obtained roughly one data point per day . in order to sample variations on as short timescales as possible , we observed 3c  111 with the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) on board _ xmm - newton _",
    "continuously for about 130 ks on 2009 february 16 - 17 .",
    "the epic - pn and epic - mos data were obtained in the small window and partial window mode , respectively , using the thin filter .",
    "the data were processed with the the science analysis software version 8.0.0 . we filtered the pn data to include only single and double - pixel events ( i.e. , pattern @xmath19 4 ) .",
    "a pn light curve was extracted in the 2.410 kev energy band , similar to that of our _ rxte _ data , and was background - subtracted and binned to 1000 s time intervals . in general , pn data are more suitable for timing analysis and the average count rate in the pn light curve was higher than that in the mos light curves .",

    "the rejection confidence , equal to one minus the success fraction , is much less than 0.9 , hence the model provides an acceptable fit to the psd .",
    "we also fit a broken power law to the optical psd , setting the low - frequency slope at @xmath62 and allowing the break frequency and the slope above the break to vary over a wide range of parameters ( @xmath99 to @xmath100 hz and @xmath62 to @xmath101 , respectively ) while calculating the success fractions .",
    "this gives lower success fractions than the simple power - law model across the entire parameter space .",
    "since we do not have any significantly long segment of the @xmath0-band data when the sampling frequency was more than 2 - 3 days per week , we determine the optical psd up to the highest variational frequency that can be achieved with the existing data .",
    "a better constraint on the existence of a break in the optical psd could be achieved with a broader range of sampled frequencies .",
    "the slope of the optical psd in the range @xmath102 to @xmath103 hz is significantly steeper than that in x - rays over the same range ( @xmath2@xmath104 ) .",
    "hence , the ratio of shorter to longer timescale variability amplitude is smaller at optical than at x - ray wavelengths .",
    "we calculate the fractional root mean squared variability amplitude , i.e. , the  excess variance \" normalized by the square of the mean flux , as a measure of the variability in the x - ray and optical data .",
    "it is defined as @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the variance , @xmath107 is the observational uncertainty , and @xmath108 is the mean of the data @xcite .",
    "we find that the values of @xmath109 of the x - ray and optical variability for the entire data set are @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively .",
    "this supports the above conclusion from the psd analysis that the optical is less strongly variable than the x - ray flux at the longest timescales we probe .",
    "it also implies that optical variations can not be completely responsible for driving all of the x - ray variability observed , if we assume that most of the x - ray emission we observe is not relativistically beamed .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ xoprad ] that , from the middle of 2009 to the present , the x - ray flux undergoes only minor fluctuations about a mean value of @xmath112 erg @xmath9 s@xmath10 . during this interval , the 230 ghz flux is at a very low level , while the 15 ghz flux is decreasing .",
    "therefore , the high - state x - ray plateau coincides with a low state of the radio jet .",
    "we can extend this x - ray / radio connection to the observations of earlier years as well .",
    "the times of `` ejection '' of new radio knots in the jet ( shown by the arrows ) are related to the low x - ray states .",
    "we convolve the x - ray light curve with a gaussian smoothing function with a 10-day fwhm smoothing time to identify the major long - term trends .",
    "figure [ xsmooth ] shows the smoothed x - ray light curve and denotes the times of superluminal ejections with arrows .",
    "based on inspection of this light curve , we consider an x - ray fluctuation to be a significant dip if the smoothed x - ray flux falls by more than 30% and remains at a low level for longer than one month .",
    "we calculate the central time of each dip by determining the local minimum of the x - ray flux .",
    "we note that the minimum amplitude measured from unsmoothed data of every dip is below the average of the x - ray flux over the length of the light curve ( @xmath113 erg @xmath9 sec@xmath10 ) .",
    "it can be seen that each of the ejections is preceded by a significant dip in the x - ray flux .",
    "the prolonged low level of x - ray flux in 2005 is associated with knot k3 , which was extended along the jet axis , as is apparent in the images starting in late 2006 ( fig .",
    "[ vlbaimages ] ) .",
    "this suggests that a prolonged disturbance near the base of the jet resulted in an elongated superluminal knot .",
    "hence , d3 and the two significant dips just before and after that are considered to be one dip with multiple branches and is related to k3 .",
    "detection of the ejection of a new knot requires the analysis of a sequence of vlba images of sufficient duration to define the trajectory and speed of a knot , as is evident from figures [ vlbaimages ] and [ distepoch ] .",
    "no new bright , moving knots after k9 appeared in subsequent imaging with the vlba during the first 8 months of 2010 ( images not shown here ) .",
    "the time delay between the minimum of the x - ray dips and the time of ejection of the corresponding superluminal knot is distributed between @xmath114 and @xmath115 yr ( table [ ejecflare ] ) with a mean of @xmath116 yr .",
    "we plot the times of ejection of new knots along with the corresponding times of x - ray dips in figure [ dipejec_stline ] .",
    "a straight line fits the data extremely well with small scatter , which indicates that there is a clear association between x - ray dips and superluminal ejections .",
    "the best - fit line through the points has a slope of 1 and y - intercept of @xmath117 , which is identical to the mean delay of @xmath116 yr given above .",
    "we have performed a numerical simulation to calculate the significance of the dip - ejection correlation .",
    "if we keep the times of dips fixed and choose one million sets of nine ejections , times of which are drawn from a uniform random distribution between 2004.3 and 2010.3 ( the duration of our observations ) , the probability that there is at least one ejection event following all 9 dips by @xmath114 to @xmath115 yr is @xmath118 . in a similar simulation",
    ", we found that the probability that all 9 dips will have exactly one following ejection is @xmath119 .",
    "this shows that the dip - ejection association in 3c  111 is highly significant .",
    "to further investigate the relationship between the characteristics of the x - ray dips and vlba knots , we calculate the average flux over all epochs of the latter .",
    "we do this via modeling of the brightness distribution at each epoch with multiple components characterized by circular gaussian brightness distributions , as described in  2.4 .",
    "this shows that the average flux of the vlba knots corresponding to the shallower dips ( d2 , d4 , and d8 in fig . [ xsmooth ] ) is significantly smaller ( @xmath120 jy ) than that for the larger dips ( d1 , d3 , d5 , and d7 ) , @xmath121 jy . dip d6 is also shallow , but this may be due to the absence of data during the sun - avoidance gap , while d9 is of intermediate depth . hence k6 and k9 were not included in the average calculation . that the brighter knots correspond to more pronounced dips",
    "supports the conclusion that the x - ray minima and the ejection of knots in the jet are physically related .",
    "as determined by the discrete cross - correlation function ( dccf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shown in the top panel of figure  [ xrad ] , the x - ray flux variations are weakly correlated with those at 15 ghz in 3c  111 .",
    "the peak x - ray versus 15 ghz dccf is @xmath122 .",
    "we simulate x - ray light curves from the underlying psd as determined in  3 and resample the simulated light curves with the sampling window of the actual x - ray light curve .",
    "then we cross - correlate the resampled simulated x - ray light curves with the real 15 ghz light curve .",
    "the solid and dotted jagged lines in figure  [ xrad ] indicate 99% and 95% extremes of the distribution of correlation coefficients as a function of time delay .",
    "the dccf indicates that the x - ray flux variations are correlated with those at 37 ghz in 3c  111 , with a peak value of @xmath123 ( middle panel of figure  [ xrad ] ) .",
    "the position of the peak of the correlation function indicates the relative time delay between the variations at the two wavelengths .",
    "the time lag of the peak corresponds to x - ray variations leading those at 37 ghz by @xmath124 days .",
    "we use the fr - rss technique @xcite to calculate the mean value and the uncertainty of the cross - correlation time lag .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ xrad ] shows that the x - ray and 230 ghz variations are weakly correlated , with a peak dccf of @xmath125 .",
    "we note that if the radio flux increases within tens of days after an x - ray minimum and the x - ray flux recovers from the minimum to increase as well during this time , then a relatively weak x - ray / radio correlation will result as seen in the data presented in this paper .",
    "the significant correlation between the dips and ejections of new knots in the jet implies that increased activity in the radio jet of 3c  111 is related to a temporary _ decrease _ in x - ray production .",
    "similarly , the association between the high - state x - ray plateau with a low state of the radio jet after the middle of 2009 suggests that a persistently high x - ray flux is associated with a low radio state .",
    "it is possible that the `` corona , '' where the x - ray emission seen in agn is thought to arise from compton up - scattering of softer accretion - disk photons , might be the base of the jet @xcite . if this is the case , then the x - ray flux will be related to the number of electrons residing there and available for scattering to create x - rays .",
    "if the same number of electrons is injected into the base of the jet per unit time , then faster flow velocities will correspond to lower densities in the scattering region .",
    "the mass loading of the jet should also affect the asymptotic lorentz factor of the flow downstream if the jet is magnetically driven ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the same decrease in electron number that causes a drop in scattered x - ray emission near the disk would lead to a time - delayed increase in the speed of the jet downstream .",
    "the increase in flow speed of the jet could form a shock wave , eventually seen as a superluminal radio knot @xcite .",
    "this would then give rise to the dip - ejection sequence discussed above .",
    "the highest - amplitude 37 ghz outburst , from 2007.5 to 2008.8 , started at the same time as at 230 ghz , but reached maximum level at a later time than both the 230 ghz and x - ray flares .",
    "this can be explained by the larger optical depth at the lower frequencies prior to the 37 ghz peak .",
    "the similar amplitudes of the 37 and 230 ghz flares follow the pattern of the synchrotron - loss stage of the shock - in - jet model @xcite , which predicts that , in synchrotron flares produced in the jet , the peak amplitude should stay roughly constant as the emission becomes optically thin at progressively lower frequencies",
    ".    the mean time delay between the minimum of the x - ray dips and the time of ejection of the corresponding superluminal knot is @xmath116 yr .",
    "the average apparent speed of the moving components with well - determined motions is @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , a knot moves a distance of @xmath127 pc in @xmath117 yr , projected on the plane of the sky .",
    "( here we assume that acceleration of the flow to its terminal velocity occurs over a sufficiently short distance that the time that a moving feature spends in the acceleration zone is short compared with the total transit time to the 43 ghz core . ) since the angle of the jet axis of 3c  111 to the line of sight @xmath218@xmath128 , the actual distance traveled by the knot , given by @xmath129 is @xmath130 pc .",
    "hence , we derive a distance @xmath130 pc from the corona or the base of the jet ( where the x - rays are produced ) to the core seen on the 43 ghz vlba images .",

    "the strong x - ray / optical correlation , weak optical polarization , and smaller variance of optical compared with x - ray flux at shorter timescales are consistent with a reprocessing model . in this scenario ,",
    "the x - rays are predominantly produced by inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of thermal optical / uv seed photons from the accretion disk by hot , but non - relativistic , electrons in the corona , while a significant fraction of the optical - uv emission is due to heating of the accretion disk by x - rays produced in the above process .",

    "this implies that the optical variations on shorter time - scales are suppressed , consistent with smoothing by reprocessing .",

    "we can calculate the mean distance @xmath137 between the x - ray and optical synchrotron emission sites in the jet if we adopt @xmath138 as the angle between the jet axis and the line of sight @xcite and assume a value for the average speed @xmath139 of the jet flow between the two emission regions : @xmath140 6 , 20 , and 200 light - days for @xmath80 = 0.25 , 0.5 , and 0.974 , respectively .",
    "the last value , @xmath141 , corresponds to the velocity obtained from analysis of the superluminal apparent motion and time - scale of flux decline at 43 ghz of knots observed with the vlba @xcite .",
    "the lower values of @xmath80 near the base of the jet are in concert with theoretical models in which jets are accelerated to relativistic flow velocities over extended distances from the central engine ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "some of the thermal optical - uv emission could be produced in the accretion disk even without reprocessing via x - ray heating .",
    "the temporal nature of this emission would be different from that generated as a result of reprocessing .",
    "the x - rays may be produced mainly by up - scattering of uv rather than optical photons .",
    "this could occur if the flux of optical photons reaching the corona is much smaller than that of uv photons .",
    "such a scenario is likely if the corona is small , such that the uv emission region is much closer to the corona than the region where the majority of the optical photons are produced ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "any disturbance propagating outward in the accretion disk will cause a change in the uv flux ( and a resultant nearly immediate change in the x - ray emission ) followed by a similar change in the optical flux .",
    "this may also give rise to the x - ray / optical time delay that is observed .",
    "as discussed in detail by @xcite , the variability timescale described above is consistent with the model proposed by @xcite and @xcite , in which variability in the disk emission is caused by large - scale alignment of poloidal magnetic field in the inner accretion disk from random fluctuations in field direction .",
    "such alignment occurs on a timescale of a few tens of days for a bh of mass of @xmath2@xmath69m@xmath70 , consistent with the results described above .    the time delay of @xmath132 days of the optical with respect to the x - ray variations is larger than expected from a pure reprocessing model .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the region of the accretion disk that produces the largest amount of direct ( rather than reprocessed ) optical emission is at @xmath2100 gravitational radii ( @xmath142 ) from the center , which is equal to @xmath21 light - day for a bh mass of @xmath143 m@xmath70 ( see also the detailed modeling of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore , if the x - ray / optical time delay is solely due to light travel time from the corona to the region in the accretion disk producing reprocessed optical emission , the corresponding reprocessing region has to be farther and/or extended than this by an order of magnitude ( @xmath21000 @xmath142 ) .",
    "if , on the other hand , the variability is caused by disturbances propagating outward through the disk at velocity v@xmath144 , then the optical emission region could be closer by a factor v@xmath144/c .",
    "if a fraction of the optical emission is produced in the jet , as discussed above , or the variability is partly affected by disturbances propagating in the accretion disk , then the observed time delay and flat peak of the x - ray / optical cross - correlation function could result .",
    "the accretion rate estimated in  3 , @xmath145 , is within the range at which the transition from high to low state occurs in the galactic bhxrbs @xcite .",
    "an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) solution may exist for accretion onto black holes at this rate @xcite .",
    "the radiation in an adaf is dominated by thermal comptonization , which has been used to explain the x - ray spectra of bhxrbs in the canonical low - hard state ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is possible that the x - rays from 3c 111 that we have attributed to a distribution of hot electrons consistent with the corona might instead be produced by an adaf .",
    "although 3c  111 and 3c  120 fall into two different fanaroff - riley categories , they have a number of common characteristics . both are radio - loud agns with jets that dominate the emission at radio frequencies , but with less radiative power than typical blazars and directed at a wider angle to our line of sight . in both radio galaxies ,",
    "the low optical polarization is consistent with most of the optical continuum resulting from blackbody radiation from the accretion disk .",
    "the x - ray properties are consistent with inverse compton scattering of thermal optical - uv photons from the disk by a distribution of hot electrons  the corona , which could be the base of the jet  situated near the disk . in 3c  111 , some of the optical and x - ray emission could be from the jet .",
    "a major difference between these two radio galaxies is in the accretion rate . in 3c 120 ,",
    "the accretion rate is high ( @xmath20.3 @xmath146 ) , similar to galactic bhxrbs in the x - ray high state . in 3c 111 , it is lower by an order of magnitude ( @xmath20.02 @xmath146 ) which is close to the transition from high to low state in galactic bhxrbs .",
    "therefore , the inner accretion flow in 3c 111 may be advection dominated .    the x - ray emission from each of these radio galaxies",
    "possesses a characteristic timescale that is proportional to the bh mass , similar to what is observed in galactic bhxrbs and seyfert galaxies .",
    "this result implies that there is a universality in the accretion processes of bhs in the mass range @xmath147 to @xmath12 .",
    "these objects also show a clear connection between the radiative state near the bh and events in the jet .",
    "ejection of new knots in the jet following dips in the x - ray light curve observed in these two radio galaxies is somewhat similar to the galactic micro - quasar grs 1915 + 105 , where knots with apparent superluminal motion appear in the jet after the x - ray flux recovers from intervals of very low flux levels @xcite .",
    "this connection is expected according to current theories of jet launching and collimation , but has not been demonstrated previously to extend to radio - loud agns .",
    "the relationships that we have uncovered between the central engine and the jet provide strong support for the paradigm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that agns and galactic bhxrbs are fundamentally similar , with characteristic time and size scales proportional to the mass of the central bh .",
    "this implies that we can develop and test models of agns based partly on observations of bhxrbs .",
    "this paper presents well - sampled , 6-yr - long light curves of 3c  111 between 2004 and 2010 at x - ray , optical , and radio wavebands , as well as monthly images obtained with the vlba at 43 ghz .",
    "the appearance of new knots in the vlba images of the jet follow prominent dips in the smoothed x - ray light curve , demonstrating a connection between events in the jet at parsec scales and those occurring near or in the accretion disk .",
    "we have calculated the broad - band x - ray power spectral density ( psd ) of 3c  111 and cross - correlated the x - ray and optical light curves , determining the significance of the correlations with light curves simulated in accordance with the psd . from the analysis of the temporal properties of the observed variability in multiple wave bands , we infer the locations and radiative mechanisms of the x - ray and optical emission .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows : + ( 1 ) the x - ray psd of 3c  111 is best fit by a bending power - law model with a smooth change in slope above a break frequency .",
    "the best - fit value of the break frequency is @xmath148 hz , corresponding to a break timescale of @xmath149 days , which agrees with the empirical relation between break timescale , bh mass , and accretion rate obtained by @xcite based on a sample of mainly radio - quiet seyfert galaxies .",
    "this indicates that the accretion process in 3c  111 is similar to that of bhxrbs and seyfert galaxies , and that there is a possible universality in the accretion processes in bhs spanning a broad range of masses from 10 @xmath150 to @xmath69 @xmath150 .",
    "+ ( 2 ) in 3c  111 , the 210 kev continuum flux and the fe line intensity are strongly correlated , with a time lag shorter than 90 days and consistent with zero .",
    "this implies that the fe line is generated within 90 light - days of the source of the x - ray continuum .",
    "+ ( 3 ) all x - ray dips are followed by the ejection of a new knot in the vlba images .",
    "we derive a distance from the base of the jet or corona ( where the x - rays are produced ) to the vlba 43 ghz core region of @xmath20.6 pc using the average time delay between the minimum of the x - ray dips and the time of passage of the corresponding superluminal knots through the core . + ( 4 ) the dip - ejection connection can be explained if a decrease in the x - ray production is linked with increased speed in the jet flow , causing a shock front to eventually form and move downstream .",
    "this property of 3c  111 is similar to 3c  120 and reminiscent of galactic bh systems , where transitions to high - soft x - ray states are associated with the emergence of very bright features that proceed to propagate down the radio jet .",
    "+ ( 5 ) most of the optical emission in 3c  111 is generated in the accretion disk due to x - ray heating .",
    "however , weak optical polarization indicates that some fraction of the optical emission is synchrotron radiation from the jet .",
