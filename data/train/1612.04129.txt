    "in the past decades the exponential increase in computing power predicted by moore s law has been enabled by scaling complementary metal - oxide - semiconductor ( cmos ) silicon - based devices , i.e. , reducing their size and limiting at the same time their power dissipation , while increasing the operating frequency . with transistor dimensions going below 10  nm ,",
    "fundamental limitations are emerging both in terms of manufacturing costs and device performance . to sustain moore s law , a paradigm shift either in device architecture or in materials is needed .    in this respect , using 2d systems as conduction channels is definitely one of the most exciting opportunities@xcite .",
    "indeed , their ultimate thinness can reduce short - channel effects , one of the main detrimental factors for devices at ultrashort lengths .",
    "for this reason , starting with the experimental realisation of graphene@xcite , single - layer materials have gained considerable attention for a large number of different applications .",
    "several studies , in particular , have targeted graphene as a component of novel devices , motivated by its exciting electronic , mechanical and thermal properties , such as its extremely high mobility  @xcite . despite its appeal",
    ", graphene has regrettably no gap .",
    "therefore , it is not suited for electronic applications such as field - effect transistors ( fets ) , where a semiconductor material with a finite gap is required for device switching .",
    "the first suitable candidate , the transition - metal dichalcogenide ( tmdc ) mos@xmath0,@xcite has been shown to be an interesting transistor material , even if its mobility is much lower than that of graphene@xcite .",
    "the list of relevant two - dimensional systems has then been enriched by other tmdcs  @xcite and by many other layered materials , such as black phosphorus and its monolayer form phosphorene , that is promising for its high mobility@xcite .    in light of the current pace at which 2d materials are being identified",
    ", we can not expect that each new candidate is grown experimentally with high quality and then devices with various geometries are fabricated , characterised and optimised .",
    "instead , simulations can be used to efficiently determine and optimise materials properties and device characteristics and filter only a few systems to send then to the laboratory .",
    "promising candidates can be considered , for instance , by looking for materials chemically similar to existing ones . as an example",
    ", two new monolayer materials composed of group  v elements ( in analogy with phosphorene ) have been recently theoretically investigated : arsenene and antimonene,@xcite made of as and sb , respectively .",
    "the authors have put forward the hypothesis that they could be attractive for device applications . while this suggestion is reasonable , only an accurate simulation of a complete device can support this hypothesis and will further stimulate experimental interest@xcite in these novel 2d materials .",
    "this task is not straightforward , however , because the simulation of a device requires a preliminary characterisation of the material .",
    "while properties and parameters are available in the literature for well - studied systems ( such as bulk si or iii - v semiconductors ) , in the case of new materials they are typically not available , nor they can be easily extracted from known systems ; they must instead be calculated from first principles",
    ". this can be true even in simple cases : for instance , despite their chemical similarity , arsenene and antimonene display very different electronic and mechanical properties with respect to phosphorene , as they originate from different allotropes and have thus a completely different crystal structure .",
    "on the other hand , performing a full device simulation directly from first principles is computationally out of reach .",
    "device simulators based on effective tight - binding hamiltonians  @xcite are viable , but require the knowledge of on - site and hopping energies , and a few different methods have been proposed in the literature to address the issue of bridging the different simulation scales  @xcite .    here",
    ", we adopt a multiscale approach based on maximally localised wannier functions ( mlwf )  @xcite , while providing a physical understanding of the transport properties of monolayer as and sb .",
    "basic electronic properties are calculated from first principles using density - functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "the electronic wavefunctions are then used as input to obtain mlwf in a multiscale approach , providing us with an effective tight - binding hamiltonian for the relevant electronic bands around the fundamental gap , and retaining at the same time full first - principles accuracy in the results.@xcite mlwf are used to characterise the material ( e.g. , effective masses ) by exploiting the efficient band interpolation , and as a localised tight - binding basis set to simulate the currents in a complete device with a non - equilibrium green function ( negf ) formalism  @xcite . in particular , we consider double - gate metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect transistors ( mosfets ) based on arsenene and antimonene channels and compare their performance against industry requirements .",
    "we show that such devices have the potential to achieve the target set by the international technology roadmap for semiconductors ( itrs )  @xcite for future competitive devices for high performance digital applications , in particular in terms of the capability of behaving as an outstanding switch even in the ultra - scaled regime .",
    "the first step towards the multiscale simulation of devices based on as and sb monolayers is the computation from first principles of their electronic structure . to perform this task",
    ", we carried out dft simulations using the quantum espresso@xcite suite of codes , efficiently automated using aiida@xcite ( more details in the methods section ) .",
    "all calculations reported here include spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) effects . in the supplementary note 1",
    "we discuss in detail the effect of soc and compare the results obtained here with those without soc .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dft - wannier]a we show the equilibrium crystal structure of arsenene and antimonene . differently to phosphorene , as and sb monolayers are not puckered , but display a buckled structure more similar to silicene or germanene  @xcite , with two inequivalent atoms inside the primitive hexagonal unit cell lying on two different planes .",
    "( note that as and sb have also been predicted to exist in a puckered structure , but this phase is energetically less favourable  @xcite ) .",
    "the separation @xmath1 between the planes reads 1.394    for as and 1.640    for sb , while the equilibrium lattice constant @xmath2 is , respectively , 3.601    and 4.122   .",
    "the band structure of both materials is very similar and in fig .",
    "[ fig : dft - wannier]b we show the energy bands along a high - symmetry path in the brillouin zone obtained from dft ( empty circles ) in the case of arsenene ( for the bands of antimonene see supplementary figure 1 ) .",
    "the dft band gap is indirect ( for both materials ) and equal to @xmath3  ev for as and @xmath4  ev for sb .",
    "the maximum of the valence bands is located at the @xmath5 point and , without soc , it would be two - fold degenerate ; the inclusion of the soc splits the degeneracy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dft - wannier]b and supplementary figure 2 ) and the topmost valence band becomes non - degenerate , except for the twofold spin degeneracy .",
    "the minimum of the conduction bands lies instead along the @xmath6 m line and gives rise to six valleys .",
    "further analyses of the electronic properties of arsenene and antimonene have been performed by first mapping the bloch eigenstates associated with the bands around the gap into a set of maximally localised wannier functions@xcite .",
    "we focused in particular on the three top valence bands and three bottom conduction bands ( per spin component ) .",
    "the main orbital contribution to these bands comes from @xmath7-orbitals of the atoms that form bonding and antibonding combinations around the gap . by projecting over the @xmath7-orbitals of the two atoms in the primitive cell",
    ", the standard localisation procedure leads to six wannier functions per spin component , three centred on one atom and three on the other . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dft - wannier]a we show the spatial profile of the three wannier functions centred on atoms belonging to the lower plane ( the other three can be obtained simply by spatial inversion through a mid - bond centre ) .",
    "they clearly have a @xmath7-like character with minor contributions from neighbouring atoms . from the knowledge of these wannier functions it is straightforward to compute the matrix elements of the hamiltonian between them .",
    "in such a way , it becomes possible to interpolate efficiently the hamiltonian at any arbitrary @xmath8point in reciprocal space , keeping the same accuracy of the underlying first - principles simulation , but at an extremely reduced computational cost . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dft - wannier]b we show the wannier - interpolated energy bands ( red solid lines ) with a much denser mesh than the original dft results ( empty circles ) for as monolayer ( bands for sb monolayer are shown in supplementary figure 1 ) . exploiting such interpolation scheme",
    ", we also computed the effective masses for relevant band extrema that crucially affect carrier mobilities and intraband tunnelling amplitudes .",
    "we both fitted the electronic bands along principal directions and evaluated accurately the density - of - states ( dos ) on an extremely dense grid .",
    "the values of the masses are reported in table  [ tab : effmasses ] for both materials .",
    "in particular , for the valence band maxima , the soc splits the degeneracy of the two topmost bands at @xmath5 .",
    "since the magnitude of the splitting is large , for realistic band filling levels we can limit ourselves to consider only the topmost valence band , with ( isotropic ) mass @xmath9 .",
    "( if soc was neglected , we would need instead to consider both degenerate bands , as discussed in supplementary notes 25 and supplementary figures 25 . ) for the conduction bands , the isoenergies of the six valleys are oblate with a larger effective mass @xmath10 in the longitudinal direction with respect to the transverse effective mass @xmath11 .",
    "the effective dos mass for each valley @xmath12 computed independently is in agreement with what can be expected from geometrical arguments , i.e. @xmath13 .    as a first assessment of the material properties toward the realisation of a transistor device using arsenene or antimonene as channel materials",
    ", we estimate whether the ballistic approximation is valid at room - temperature ( @xmath14k ) in the ultrascaled sub-10  nm regime that we investigate in this work .",
    "we will limit the analysis only to the intrinsic scattering with longitudinal acoustic ( la ) phonons .",
    "as other scattering mechanisms may be active in the system , the values that we calculate should be considered as upper limits to the actual scattering times or , equivalently , to the carrier mobility .",
    "in particular , while out - of - plane ( za ) phonons may play an important role in free - standing dirac materials without planar symmetry  @xcite , we do not consider them here . while in a free - standing material scattering with za phonons can be relevant , in our systems the device geometry ( presence of substrate and of top gates ) will shift the za phonon modes at finite energy , reducing their impact on the mobilities.@xcite    while accurate values for the electron - phonon scattering terms can be obtained fully ab - initio  @xcite , an efficient method to get estimates for the scattering times and mobilities relies on deformation - potential theory@xcite and fermi s golden rule to estimate the scattering times .",
    "an estimate of the 2d mobility can be then obtained using takagi s formula  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the transport effective mass , @xmath17 the dos effective mass ( table 1 ) , @xmath18 the boltzmann constant , @xmath19 the temperature , @xmath20 the deformation potential constant , and @xmath21 the elastic modulus . in our case , we need to consider this formula in the multi - valley , anisotropic case : details can be found in supplementary notes 39 and described in supplementary figures 37 , as well as the values of the extracted relevant parameters ( deformation potentials and elastic moduli , reported in supplementary tables 1 and 2 , respectively ) .",
    "we would like to emphasise , however , that this formula , while often adopted in the literature , can not be used to obtain a quantitative estimate of the mobility .",
    "indeed , the formula neglects the coupling with za phonons ( which may be important , as already discussed above ) , as well as with ta and optical phonons . moreover",
    ", it can not fully capture the anisotropy of the electron - phonon coupling coefficients .",
    "a full ab - initio treatment of the electron - phonon scattering is required , if a quantitative estimation is needed ( see e.g. discussions in refs .  ) .",
    "nevertheless , we provide here an estimate of what we will call hereafter takagi s mobilities , mainly to allow to compare as and sb with other 2d materials already investigated in the literature within the same level of theory .",
    "we have estimated that , in the worst case scenario , the values of actual mobilities could be reduced up to a factor of 8 when a full treatment of the electron - phonon coupling is adopted , including intervalley scattering .",
    "the values of the electron takagi s mobility are quite promising and comparable with theoretical results for phosphorene using the same level of theory@xcite and even better than mos@xmath0@xcite owing to the smaller deformation potential .",
    "the hole takagi s mobility is even larger , and in particular much larger than the experimentally measured value of the mobility in mos@xmath0 at room temperature@xcite and in other 2d materials , like e.g. phosphorene@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we note that our predicted values are smaller than those predicted by simulations at the same level of theory ( takagi s formula ) for phosphorene@xcite , owing to the larger elastic modulus and smaller deformation potential in the zigzag direction .",
    "we also emphasise that in arsenene and antimonene the soc effects are negligible for the conduction band . instead",
    ", @xmath23 is significantly enhanced by the soc , due to the splitting of the topmost valence band and the resulting changes in the effective masses and deformation potentials ( see supplementary tables 1 to 3 ) . in particular",
    ", the inclusion of the soc increases @xmath23 by 25% and 84% in as and sb , respectively ( see supplementary table 4 ) .    from these values of the takagi s mobilities and the associated scattering times and carrier velocities reported in the supplementary note 10 , we estimate that the mean free path limited by la phonons is of the order of tens of nm . for this reason we assume that , for the dimensions considered in this work , the use of the ballistic approximation is justified and sets a higher limit to the performance achievable in these devices .",
    ".[tab : effmasses]*valence and conduction effective masses of arsenene and antimonene : * effective masses of the relevant bands of arsenene and antimonene , in units of the electron mass @xmath25 , when soc effects are included .",
    "symbols are explained in the main text .",
    "note that @xmath12 is the effective dos mass for each of the 6 identical conduction band valleys .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     using the values of supplementary table  [ tab : defpot ] , table  1 ( in the main paper ) and supplementary table  [ tab : elasticmoduli ] , calculated as described in the previous sections , we estimated the values for the mobilities at @xmath26 , in units of @xmath24 , that we report in supplementary table  [ tab : mobility - final ] . note that since we expect that the total mobility is isotropic , we indicate only the average value obtained for the armchair and the zigzag directions . in any case",
    ", the values in the two directions differ ( due to numerical errors ) by less than 5% .    for completeness",
    ", we also report the value of the single - valley conduction mobility tensor , including spin - orbit coupling effects , in a basis set where the first vector is along the armchair direction and the second along the zigzag one , and expressed in units of @xmath24 : @xmath27    using the formulas above , one can also calculate the scattering times of electrons with la phonons , that turn out to be ( in conduction ) : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "finally , in order to estimate the mean free path , it is useful to evaluate the fermi velocity for electrons in the @xmath6 m valleys , that for electrons along the @xmath32 principal direction of the valley is given by : @xmath33 where we have used the 2d dos to relate the the effective doping of the system @xmath34 to the fermi energy , and where @xmath35 indicates the effective mass in the @xmath32 direction . as a reference value , for a doping of @xmath36",
    ", we obtain for as : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , while for sb : @xmath39 , @xmath40 .        in order to span the whole device parameter space and optimise the device performances , we compare the @xmath42 curves of n - mos and p - mos devices in supplementary figure  [ fig : nmospmos ] , in the case of a as device with @xmath43  nm ( similar results are obtained for sb fets ) .",
    "as it can be seen , the n - mos device shows larger currents and better ss as compared to the p - type device .",
    "for this reason , in the main text we decided to focus on n - mosfets only , in order to obtain the best performance against industry requirements ."
