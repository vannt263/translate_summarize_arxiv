    "for the solar neighbourhood we have the most detailed observational data available for any galactic disc . in particular , the distributions within the solar neighbourhood of stellar ages , metallicities and space velocities are keys to deducing how the disc has evolved chemically and dynamically .",
    "work directed at understanding how galaxies have formed and evolved is a major area of contemporary astronomy , and studies of the local disc have an important role to play in this effort . despite much progress many questions about the evolution of the local disc remain open .",
    "the _ hipparcos _ catalogue provides uniquely useful data for studies of the solar neighbourhood , because the data are homogeneous and of high quality .",
    "* hereafter db98 ) defined a kinematically unbiased sample of _ hipparcos _ stars and investigated its kinematics , while ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bdb00 ) used the sample to model the history of star formation and the stochastic acceleration of stars in the disc . in this paper",
    "we redefine the sample and then re - work these papers for several reasons .    * in a systematic re - reduction of the astrometric data from the _ hipparcos _ satellite , @xcite has been able to diminish significantly the errors for a large number of stars . using the new data we can enlarge the sample of stars that can be used for modelling .",
    "* bdb00 did not take into account the variation of the scale height of stars with age .",
    "consequently , their conclusions regarding past star - formation rates and rates of stochastic acceleration are wrong .",
    "our analysis remedies this defect . * from an analysis of the age - velocity dispersion relation in the sample of 189 stars in @xcite , @xcite argued that stochastic heating saturates after only @xmath14 and that the velocity dispersion of disc stars increased abruptly @xmath15 ago as a result of a merger .",
    "we use our much larger sample to test this conjecture . *",
    "metallicity and radial - velocity measurements from the geneva copenhagen survey [ @xcite , hereafter gcs , @xcite , hereafter gcs2 and @xcite , hereafter gcs3 ] of f and g dwarfs allow more accurate determinations of the metallicity distribution of disc stars and the three - dimensional velocity dispersions in the corresponding colour interval . *",
    "new padova isochrones have recently been published @xcite , allowing us to update the input concerning stellar evolution and to improve the modelling of the metallicity distribution . * a revision of the impact of interstellar reddening on our sample changes some results significantly .",
    "the goal of this paper is the same as that of bdb00 : to understand as much of the history of the disc as we can by modelling the large - scale structure of velocity space near the sun .",
    "we do not address the small - scale structure of this space , which was first clearly revealed by the _ hipparcos _",
    "catalogue through the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : data ] describes our input data .",
    "section [ sec : kinematics ] updates db98 by extracting the kinematics of the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the work of bdb00 is updated in section [ sec : models ] , which describes our models , and section [ sec : fits ] , which describes fits of them to the data .",
    "section [ sec : conclude ] sums up and compares our results with those of other authors .",
    "we follow the procedure of db98 to select from the new reduction of the _ hipparcos _ catalogue @xcite a kinematically unbiased , magnitude - limited subsample of single stars with high - quality astrometric data .",
    "we determine the apparent magnitude up to which the _ hipparcos _ catalogue is complete ( @xmath16mag ) , which depends on colour and position on the sky , by comparing the _ hipparcos _ catalogue with the _ tycho2 _ catalogue @xcite , which is complete to about @xmath17 . for @xmath18 uniformly spaced bins in galactic coordinates @xmath19 and @xmath20 and colour @xmath21 in @xmath22 , we select those stars that are brighter than the second brightest star per bin that is in the _ tycho2 _ but not the _ hipparcos _ catalogue . 44@xmath23567 out of the 118@xmath23218 _ hipparcos _ stars are single stars that fulfil this criterion . from these stars",
    "we further select stars with relative parallax errors of @xmath24 or less .",
    "this criterion reduces the sample from 44@xmath23567 to 20@xmath23360 but ensures that the measured proper motions yield fairly accurate tangential velocities .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] is the colour - magnitude diagram of the sample . for our analysis of the star - formation history ,",
    "we require a one - to - one relationship between the maximum lifetime of a star and its colour , so we restrict ourselves to main - sequence stars .",
    "the lines within which stars are deemed to lie on the main sequence are shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the applied cmd cut leaves the possibility for a small number of subgiant stars to enter the sample in the colour range @xmath25 , where the sample might thus be slightly biased towards old stars . the 15@xmath23113 stars that lie between these lines comprise our final sample , which is approximately 27% larger than that of db98 .",
    "the growth in the sample is most pronounced for blue stars since these tend to be more luminous and distant and therefore have the smallest parallaxes .",
    "gcs have measured radial velocities for 6@xmath23918 single f and g dwarfs in our sample .",
    "these stars are confined to the colour interval @xmath26 .",
    "we use this subsample , for which individual space velocities can be determined , as a control of the results obtained with the main sample .",
    "the age distribution of main - sequence stars of a given colour must vary with colour because at the blue end of the main sequence all stars must be younger than the short main - sequence lifetime there , while at the red end of the main sequence we see stars that are as old as the disc in addition to recently - formed stars .",
    "we use padova isochrones @xcite for masses ranging from 0.15 to @xmath27 to determine the age distribution at each colour .",
    "isochrones depend significantly on the metal content @xmath28 and the helium abundance @xmath29 , so we have to use several isochrones to simulate the metallicity distribution of the solar neighbourhood .",
    "we refer to section [ subsec : z ] for a discussion of the weightings of the isochrones employed and focus on which isochrones to employ .    for the conversion from solar units to @xmath28 and",
    "@xmath29 we need to know the solar abundances .",
    "@xcite argue that the update of the solar chemical composition by @xcite ( @xmath30,@xmath31 ) gives rise to several problems and uncertainties and adopt ( @xmath32,@xmath33 ) for their solar model .",
    "moreover @xcite report that solar models with @xmath34 are inconsistent with the helioseismic data .",
    "since we use the @xcite isochrones , we use their solar composition .",
    "as the measurement of the helium abundance @xmath29 of a star is difficult , there is little data available on the relationship @xmath35 within the solar neighbourhood . a common , but not undisputed procedure is to assume a linear enrichment law @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the primordial helium abundance and @xmath38 is the helium - to - metal enrichment ratio .",
    "@xcite find @xmath39 for @xmath40 , whereas @xcite using padova isochrones find that it is doubtful whether a universal linear enrichment law exists . for metallicities similar to the solar one they also find @xmath41 .",
    "unfortunately , this slope when combined with either the traditional values @xmath42 or the new values @xmath43 of @xcite is inconsistent with the generally accepted wmap value @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "nonetheless we adopt @xmath45 .",
    "table[tab8 ] gives the chemical compositions of the isochrones we have employed .",
    ".the metallicities of the padova isochrones that were used in the models and the corresponding @xmath46 $ ] values , which were calculated with solar abundances @xmath33 and @xmath32 . [ cols=\"^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      in our models we have so far assumed that the velocity dispersion increases continuously with age . in the context of the galactic thick disc ,",
    "an obvious question to ask is what would be the effect of assigning a high velocity dispersion , @xmath47 @xcite , to the low - metallicity component .",
    "shows that this procedure produces an additional feature in the curve @xmath48 that underlines again the narrow colour interval to which the low - metallicity component is confined .",
    "the reason for this is that the thick disk is not only metal - poor and old , but has a more complex structure @xcite .    in this context",
    "it is also interesting to study whether a saturation of disc heating , or a merger event producing a discontinuity in the time evolution of @xmath49 , or a combination of the two is compatible with the data .",
    "we adopt the alternative model ( [ qgsigma ] ) of @xmath50 .",
    "this model introduces three additional parameters , @xmath51 when heating saturates , @xmath52 when there is a step increase in @xmath49 and @xmath53 , the scale of that increase . table[tab6 ] provides an overview of results obtained by fixing these parameters .",
    "we start by looking at a pure saturation of disc heating ( @xmath54 ) with @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . intuitively , this model is incompatible with the phenomenon of parenago s discontinuity unless @xmath58 , and that is what the results confirm .",
    "for @xmath54 we can firmly exclude @xmath59 .",
    "consider now the proposal of @xcite that @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "our best fit , obtained with @xmath63 , is shown by the red curve in fig.[fig14 ] .",
    "the curve of @xmath64 moves from the high to the low side of the data around @xmath65 as a result of two changes in slope at the points marked by arrows ; at these points the main - sequence age corresponds to @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "this figure and the high @xmath66 given in table  [ tab6 ] exclude this model .    to see whether the unwanted features associated with @xmath51 and @xmath52 could be washed out by an irregular star - formation history rather than the smooth one used in our models , we modelled the data using @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath63 and overlaying our smooth sfr with a factor varying with time according to fig .  8 of @xcite",
    ". the resulting fit to the data , shown by the long - dashed line in , is even worse than that shown in .",
    "another possibility is that large errors in @xmath67 ( @xmath68mag ) could smooth away the unwanted discontinuities . to test this hypothesis we folded @xmath64 for the ( @xmath14 , @xmath69 , 1.75 ) model with a gaussian of @xmath70 dispersion .",
    "still the discontinuities did not disappear ( short - dashed curve in ) .",
    "acceptable models can be found by allowing @xmath51 to approach @xmath52 with corresponding adjustment to @xmath53 .",
    "for example , the fit provided by the ( @xmath71 , @xmath69 , 1.5 ) model is shown as the black curve in fig.[fig14 ] : the fit to @xmath64 is clearly better than that for ( @xmath14 , @xmath69 , 1.75 ) model and nearly as good as the best fit without saturation ( blue curve ) .",
    "overall one has the impression that models with @xmath51 close to @xmath52 are merely approximating a power - law dependence with an appropriate step .",
    "all plots of @xmath64 , whether for models or data , show a counterintuitive decrease in sigma for the reddest bins : the velocity dispersion in our models increases with age , so decreasing @xmath49 implies a decrease in mean age as one moves redwards of the discontinuity . shows model age distributions at @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "for the reddest colour we see only a smooth increase in numbers with age , reflecting the declining sfr , and a feature at high ages , resulting from the low - metallicty component . at the bluer colours we have strong features . from equation ( [ xx ] ) we see that they must reflect wider mass intervals yielding stars of the given colour at a certain time .",
    "the explanation for this is that in the vicinity of the turnoff , the isochrones run almost vertically and the colours of stars become nearly independent of mass for a significant range of masses . in the blue age distribution for @xmath75 shows eight peaks produced in this way , one from each of the eight metallicities used for the ` thin disk ' component and also a low - metallicity feature at high ages .",
    "because the dominant peaks all lie at ages higher than @xmath71 , they raise the average age of stars in this colour bin above that of the bin for @xmath76 , which contains only stars too low in mass to have reached the turnoff .",
    "we have updated the work of db98 and bdb00 to take advantage of the reworking of the _ hipparcos _ catalogue by @xcite , the availability of line - of - sight velocities from the geneva  copenhagen survey , and significant improvements to the modelling .",
    "the latter include updated isochrones , better treatments of interstellar reddening , the selection function and the age - metallicity relation , and exploration of a wider range of histories of star - formation and stellar acceleration .",
    "we have redetermined the solar motion with respect to the lsr . the new value ( eq .",
    "1 ) is very similar to that of db98 but has smaller error bars .",
    "we have redetermined the structure of the velocity ellipsoid as a function of colour .",
    "again the results differ from those of db98 mainly in the reduced error bars .    the most striking change in results compared to bdb00 is an increase in the minimum age of the solar neighbourhood @xmath77 .",
    "this increase is largely due to an improved treatment of interstellar reddening , which was overestimated by bdb00 .",
    "models in which the sfr is @xmath78 fit the data best at @xmath79 and favour @xmath80 ; these models yield a lower age limit of @xmath81",
    ". models in which the sfr is a double exponential corresponding to the formation of the thick and thin discs favour ages in the range @xmath82 and yield a lower limit of @xmath83 .",
    "for either model of the sfr , the lower age limit of bdb00 , @xmath69 , can be excluded .",
    "our estimates are in good agreement with the @xmath12 age derived by @xcite and the @xmath84 obtained by sb09a .",
    "it is also in agreement with the individual stellar ages of gcs and gcs2 , which include a significant fraction of ages between 10 and 15 gyr .",
    "the study of galactic evolution in a cosmological context by @xcite yields @xmath85 , while that of @xcite yields @xmath86 , our lower limit .",
    "thus there is a considerable body of evidence that the solar neighbourhood started forming a remarkably long time ago .",
    "the strong correlation between the parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 that characterise the imf and sfr , which was discussed by @xcite and bdb00 , limit what we can say about the imf and sfr .",
    "we use a @xcite imf and find that the sfr is decreasing : the factor by which it decreases from the beginning of star formation until now is found to lie between @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "this conclusion agrees with the findings of @xcite and of @xcite , who used a non - exponential time dependence of the sfr , and what we find when the sfr is modelled by a sum of exponentials in time .",
    "our conclusion regarding the time dependence of the sfr conflicts with the finding of bdb00 that the sfr was essentially flat for a salpeter imf because the introduction of variable scale heights decreases the visibility of red stars relative to blue stars , so the models have to predict the existence of a higher fraction of red stars than formerly .",
    "it also conflicts with the conclusion of sb09a that the sfr is only mildly decreasing for a salpeter imf because in their models many of the old stars in the solar neighbourhood are immigrants from smaller radii while immigration of young stars is negligible .",
    "@xcite conclude that the sfr increases in the first @xmath91 and then decreases by a factor 2 until now , while @xcite argue that the milky way disc has a generally increasing but very irregular sfr .",
    "neither picture is compatible with our results .",
    "there are similar conflicts with the conclusions of @xcite that the sfr is broadly increasing and of @xcite that the sfr increases early on and has been roughly constant over the last @xmath92 .",
    "we can exclude the scenario of @xcite that disc heating saturates after @xmath14 but at @xmath69 the velocity dispersion abruptly increases by a factor of almost 2 .",
    "however , we are not able to exclude a later saturation of disc heating ( after @xmath9 ) that is combined with an abrupt increase in dispersion more recently than @xmath69 ago .",
    "similarly , @xcite find that a saturation at @xmath93 is not excluded and that there is `` extremely tentative '' evidence of an abrupt feature in the age - velocity dispersion at @xmath94 .",
    "nevertheless , nothing in the data calls for early saturation of disc heating , and scenarios that include it yield worse but formally acceptable fits to the data .    our favoured value @xmath7 for the exponent that governs the growth of @xmath95 is in perfect agreement with the findings of gcs ( 0.34 ) and bdb00 ( 0.33 ) . moreover , the value of gcs3 ( 0.40 ) is also still in the range allowed by our models .",
    "the classical value of @xmath96 @xcite yields rather bad fits and has to be regarded as the very upper limit for @xmath2 .    for @xmath5",
    "we find @xmath97 , the same value as in gcs ( 0.31 ) , but lower than that of gcs3 , whose 0.39 is yet not out of range . for @xmath98",
    "we find @xmath99 , which is higher than the gcs and gcs3 values of 0.34 and 0.40 .",
    "however , had they not ignored their oldest bins of stars , they would have obtained a larger value for @xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath3 we find @xmath100 , in good agreement with gcs ( 0.47 ) and lower than the value of gcs3 ( 0.53 ) , but higher than the 0.375 favoured by @xcite .    the values and time dependencies of the ratios @xmath101 and @xmath102 plotted in provide important clues to the still controversial mechanism of stellar acceleration .",
    "the original proposal @xcite was that acceleration is a result of stars scattering off gas clouds .",
    "this process leads to characteristic axial ratios of the velocity ellipsoid .",
    "@xcite has recently redetermined these ratios and finds @xmath103 and @xmath104 , both of which are smaller than implies .",
    "this result suggests that scattering by spiral arms , which increases @xmath105 and @xmath106 but not @xmath107 , plays an important role @xcite .",
    "further work is needed to quantify this statement in the light of sellwood s recent work .",
    "another indication that scattering by clouds is not alone responsible for acceleration is the finding of @xcite that in simulations of disc heating by clouds , @xmath108 , a value that we have excluded . for a disc heated by scattering off a combination of gas clouds and massive black holes in the dark halo @xcite find @xmath109 and @xmath110 , which is excluded by .",
    "it is widely believed that acceleration by spiral arms is responsible for the concentration of solar - neighbourhood stars in the @xmath111 plane @xcite . @xcite",
    "have argued that this concentration undermines the concept of the velocity ellipsoid .",
    "however , it remains the case that the velocity dispersions @xmath5 and @xmath98 increase systematically with age and it is not evident that any inconsistency arises from modelling this phenomenon as we do here just because spiral structure accelerates stars in groups rather than individually .",
    "sb09a have recently argued that radial mixing plays an important role in disc heating and causes a higher value of @xmath2 to be measured in the solar neighbourhood than characterises the underlying acceleration process .",
    "the origin of this effect is that stars migrate into the solar neighbourhood from small radii where the velocity dispersions are relatively high .",
    "since the fraction of immigrants among the local population increases with stellar age , this effect enhances the velocity dispersion of old stars more than that of young stars , leading to a larger effective value of @xmath2 .",
    "our value for @xmath112 is in good agreement with the prediction of sb09a for a _ hipparcos _ sample .",
    "the models of sb09a are more elaborate than ours not only in that they include radial migration but also in that they include chemical evolution",
    ". however , their parameters are determined by fitting to the gcs sample rather than the _ hipparcos _ sample employed here .",
    "the current sample covers a wider range of colours and is better defined than the gcs sample .",
    "moreover , sb09a made no attempt to match the kinematics of the gcs sample but assumed the validity of the description of the acceleration process given by bdb00 ; they confined themselves to the metallicity distribution and hess diagram of the gcs sample .",
    "ideally one would fit simultaneously the local kinematics , metallicity and hess diagram .",
    "however , given the importance of radial migration implied by the studies of @xcite , sb09a and @xcite , such a study would ideally include a more realistic treatment of the integrals of motion than the simple separability of the radial and vertical motions assumed here and by sb09a .",
    "the cosmic sf rate peaked at redshifts @xmath113 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , which in the concordance cosmology corresponds to look - back times between @xmath114 and @xmath81 .",
    "these times are @xmath115 later than the times @xmath77 at which star formation starts in our models , which is also the time at which the local star - formation rate peaked .",
    "it is also slightly later than the mean formation times , @xmath116 , of bulges in a recent series of large simulations of galaxy formation @xcite . on the other hand these authors found that the mean formation times of discs at @xmath117 were @xmath118 .",
    "the analogous time for the one of our models of the solar neighbourhood is @xmath119 the models listed in table  [ tab1 ] yield values of @xmath120 that range between @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "these values fall at the upper end of the times obtained by @xcite .",
    "this overshoot may be connected to the fact that their models have discs that are underweight by almost an order of magnitude ; in the models disc formation may be artificially truncated .",
    "thus our results are broadly in agreement with the results of ab - initio simulations of galaxy formation in the concordance cosmology , even though the age of the oldest solar - neighbourhood stars is remarkably large . at least some of these stars will be immigrants from small radii , and if they all are , star - formation will have started later than is implied by our values of @xmath77 .",
    "it is currently hard to place a limit on the fraction of the oldest stars that are immigrants because the models of sb09a assume that the disc s scale length does not increase over time , as is likely to be the case .",
    "thanks to adaptive optics , gas - rich discs , in which stars are forming exceedingly rapidly , can now be studied observationally at @xmath123 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , soon after the oldest solar - neighbourhood stars formed .",
    "the discs observed are clumpy and highly turbulent , so it seems more likely that they will turn into bulges than a system as dynamically cold as the solar neighbourhood .",
    "nonetheless , studies of these systems bring us tantalisingly close to the goal of tying together studies of ` galactic archaeology ' such as ours with observations of galaxies forming in the remote past .",
    "we thank gianpaolo bertelli for providing us with the latest isochrones and valuable comments on their influence on our models and ralph schnrich for valuable discussions .",
