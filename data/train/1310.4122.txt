    "supersymmetry is an important theoretical and phenomenological subject that has dominated theoretical physics for decades , despite the lack ( so far ) of evidence that it actually exists in nature .",
    "it assists us in understanding several aspects of low energy physics , from the stability of the higgs vacuum to the unification of forces , and even the low scale of inflation ( relative to the planck mass ) , in a way that is much clearer than in non - supersymmetric frameworks .",
    "the embedding of supersymmetry into a gravitational framework by promoting global supersymmetry into a local ( gauged ) symmetry , termed supergravity  @xcite , has initiated many interesting avenues of research toward understanding both the unification of gravity with the remaining three fundamental forces of nature , and to some extent quantisation of the gravitational field . in particular , it is well known that supergravity theories constitute consistent low - energy limits of superstring theories , which are thought to provide plausible paths to the quantisation of gravity in concert with other fundamental interactions .",
    "+ however , supersymmetry is not phenomenologically observed in nature , and thus if it exists , it must be broken in the low energy world .",
    "it is therefore desirable to understand the spontaneous or dynamical breaking of supersymmetry under various possible circumstances , of which , thanks to the profusion of gauge and matter sectors that may be consistently coupled into supersymmetry , there are many @xcite",
    ". it would be preferable however , to seek a way of breaking local supersymmetry ( supergravity ) directly in a dynamical manner , without the need to couple it to a gauge sector .",
    "+ one such approach would be to leverage the fermionic ( gravitino ) torsion terms that are generically present in supergravity theories , which consist of four - gravitino self - interaction terms .",
    "the latter could conceivably condense under certain circumstances , thereby producing condensates of the gravitino field , which in this way would dynamically acquire a non - zero mass whilst leaving the graviton massless . in this way supergravity",
    "would be broken _ dynamically _ , in the same spirit as the breaking of chiral symmetry in the nambu - jona - lasinio model  @xcite .",
    "+ it was conjectured in @xcite that such a dynamical breaking of supergravity could occur via the formation of condensates of the gravitino field , with analyses based on the one - loop effective potential of a simple @xmath2 supergravity model in a flat minkowski space - time ( necessary to allow an unambiguous definition of the gravitino mass via the condensate field ) .",
    "the effective potential of the gravitino condensate field , dependent on positive powers of the ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff scale due to the well - known non - renormalisability of quantum gravity in four space - time dimensions , acquires a non - trivial minimum for some values of the cutoff relative to the gravitational constant ( reduced planck mass ) . in the analyses of @xcite the gravitino thereby acquires a dynamical mass of the order of the planck scale .",
    "+ it was important for their analyses that the one - loop value of the effective potential _ vanishes _ at the non - trivial minimum , which implies the vanishing of the effective vacuum energy of the resulting low - energy theory .",
    "this arguably justifies _ a posteriori _ the minkowski space - time analysis of the effective potential .",
    "it was also important for both the entire approach and the double - well shape of the effective potential , appropriate for supergravity breaking , that the deser - zumino super - higgs effect  @xcite was incorporated self consistently by coupling the supergravity action with the non - linear volkov - akulov action  @xcite of the goldstone particle associated with the ( assumed f - type ) spontaneous global supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the latter is a majorana spin 1/2 fermion , the goldstino . +",
    "this formalism was essential for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the goldstino could be absorbed by the gravitino , under an appropriate field redefinition to make the latter massive , and thus disappear from the physical spectrum secondly , the only subsequent trace of the goldstino would be a ( negative ) cosmological constant @xmath3 in the effective action , which is associated with the scale of global supersymmetry breaking ; namely the vacuum expectation value of the appropriate f - term of the chiral scalar superfield responsible for spontaneous supersymmetry breaking .",
    "this is the super - higgs effect  @xcite which is essential in keeping track of the right degrees of freedom in the problem of dynamical acquisition of a mass by the gravitino field , and the consequent breaking of local supersymmetry .",
    "+ from the point of view of the effective potential , this would correspond to a _ positive _ term at the origin in field space of order of @xmath4 , which is responsible for the double - well shape of the potential at the broken symmetry phase .",
    "these considerations are consistent with the generic features of dynamical supersymmetry breaking outlined by witten @xcite , according to which the vacuum energy of broken global supersymmetry is _ necessarily positive _ , here @xmath5 , whilst a _ broken local supersymmetry _ ( supergravity ) can still be characterised by _ zero vacuum energy . _",
    "+ although physically appealing , the flat minkowski space - time approach of @xcite was criticised in @xcite due to the fact that it ignored the quantum fluctuations of the metric field . following the generic approach of fradkin and tseytlin @xcite of calculating the one - loop",
    "effective potential in four - dimensional supergravity theories by means of expanding about a generic ( anti)de sitter , rather than minkowski , background , the authors of @xcite have argued that integrating over metric fluctuations introduces _ imaginary _ parts in the effective potential , for any non - trivial value of the gravitino condensate field , and irrespective of the value of the background cosmological constant @xmath6 ( whose role is to effectively replace @xcite the flat - space uv cut - off of @xcite ) . + the presence of imaginary parts would of course be an indication that the non - trivial - gravitino - condensate ( broken supergravity ) vacuum is _ unstable _ , and thus there would be no possibility of breaking @xmath2 supergravity dynamically in this simple and direct way .",
    "of course , the traditional way of breaking supergravity via dynamical global supersymmetry breaking through , say , gaugino condensation @xcite , which would then be communicated to the ( super)gravity sector , evades the arguments of @xcite and thus has appeared to be the only consistent way of dynamically breaking supergravity , carrying the price of necessarily coupling the theory to matter fields .",
    "+ in this work we shall revisit the arguments and the analysis of @xcite , with a view to incorporating the super - higgs effect that was not included in their analyses . we have been motivated to do so by the compelling nature and simplicity of the possibility of direct dynamical breaking of supergravity by means of its gravitino - torsion self - interactions .",
    "+ as it turns out , and as is demonstrated below in great detail , the proper incorporation of the super - higgs effect in such a framework enables the dynamical breaking of supergravity ( prior to its coupling to matter or gauge fields ) , in the sense that a one - loop effective potential analysis considering fully metric fluctuations about ( anti)de sitter backgrounds , and thereby fully incorporating any ( weak ) quantum gravitational effects , reveals the existence of non - trivial vacua with _ no imaginary _ parts , contrary to the claims of @xcite .",
    "the double - well shape of the effective potential , and its vanishing at the non - trivial minima , fully justifies the flat - space approximate analysis of @xcite and demonstrates that the presence of the cosmological constant @xmath4 due to the super - higgs effect is responsible for the vanishing of the effective vacuum energy of the low - energy effective action of supergravity at the one - loop level . + the structure of the article is as follows .    * in section [ sec : superhiggs ] we briefly review the super - higgs effect in the context of simple @xmath7 supergravity , in order to outline to the reader its important features , and the underlying physics that will be used in our analysis of the resultant one - loop effective potential .",
    "* in section [ sec : sugra ] we set up the basic formalism and notations underlying the model of @xmath2 supergravity that we shall consider for concreteness in this work .",
    "our formalism of course applies in general to more complicated theories of supergravity . * in section [ sec : quadr ] we discuss the quadratic action obtained from previous section by incorporating weak metric fluctuations about a given ( anti)de sitter background , in conjunction with the linearisation of four - gravitino terms by means of appropriate auxiliary fields .",
    "this is the first step towards the construction of a ` proper ' ( i.e. incorporating ( weak ) quantum gravitational effects ) one - loop effective potential .",
    "we discuss bosonic and fermionic sectors separately as well as their respective gauge fixing procedures . * in section [ sec : potential ] we construct the effective potential and discuss the shape that we require in order to obtain non - trivial local supersymmetry ( supergravity ) breaking , via dynamical condensation of the gravitino field .",
    "we discuss carefully the absence of imaginary parts in certain non - trivial vacua , contrary to the claims of @xcite , and explain carefully how this may be achieved .",
    "as we also show in subsection [ sec : confsugra ] , phenomenologically realistic values for the gravitino mass and the associated breaking scale of global supersymmetry can be achieved only in appropriate conformal extensions of the @xmath2 supergravity , which may also be relevant for inflation . *",
    "conclusions and outlook are then given in section [ sec : concl ] , and some technical aspects of our approach of constructing the one - loop effective potential are discussed in an appendix .",

    "we keep the discussion general by allowing for an arbitrary value of the parameter @xmath18 . + as discussed in  @xcite , one can promote the global supersymmetry to a local one , by allowing the parameter @xmath26 to depend on space - time coordinates , and coupling the action ( [ goldstino ] ) to that of @xmath0 supergravity in such a way that the combined action is invariant under the following supergravity transformations : @xmath27 where the @xmath28 in the @xmath22 transformation denote non - linear @xmath22-dependent terms ( _ cf . _ the variation ) .",

    "+ with this in mind , our prior expression for @xmath164 can now be re - expressed more concretely as @xmath278 where ( following the conventions of @xcite ) we have defined @xmath279 @xmath280 where @xmath267 , and we note that our sum starts from the minimal @xmath281 such that @xmath282 , and therefore all possible negative and zero modes are included .",
    "+ following the appendix of @xcite , it is firstly straightforward to show that @xmath283 in line with this derivation we can compute @xmath284 via a similar argument , making use of the identity @xcite @xmath285 where @xmath286 is the digamma function .",
    "we find @xmath287 we may then note that @xmath288 so that we may integrate both sides to arrive at @xmath289 where @xmath89 is a ( real ) constant of integration @xmath290    for large @xmath291 we can explicitly evaluate the integral above by shifting the measure via @xmath292 and inserting the asymptotic expansion @xmath293 where @xmath294 is the @xmath261th bernoulli number . integrating term by term , only the leading order remains relevant and we find @xmath295    combing these elements , we thus find that for small @xmath6 @xmath296 from this result , it is interesting to note that in the limit @xmath82 , the presence or absence of imaginary terms in the effective potential is a straightforward consequence of the sign of @xmath80 , the argument of the functional determinant being evaluated .",
    "this may be therefore leveraged to explicitly investigate the possibility of instabilities in the effective potential , along with the associated question of whether or not any such apparent instabilities are , in fact , one - loop artefacts which may then be disregarded .",
    "these issues are of course central to the topic of this paper .",
