    "the main object of present paper is the following coupled system of equations @xmath9 where the smooth functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 satisfy the algebraic constraint @xmath12 .",
    "the system ( [ 2hfe ] ) is a natural candidate to be a multicomponent generalisation of the classical heisenberg ferromagnetic equation .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the heisenberg ferromagnetic model is integrable in the sense of inverse scattering method ( ism ) .",
    "it has a lax pair related to the algebra @xmath13 . since the time the complete integrability of hf equations was discovered ,",
    "many attempts for its generalization have been made @xcite . a well known method @xcite to obtain new integrable nonlinear evolution equations ( nlee )",
    "is based on imposing certain algebraic reductions on generic lax operators .",
    "lax pairs associated to hermitian symmetric spaces represent a special interest in modern theory of integrable systems is study of nlees @xcite since the nlees they produce look relatively simple .",
    "the system ( [ 2hfe ] ) is also integrable in the sense of ism .",
    "its lax operators are associated with the symmetric space @xmath2 with a @xmath1 reduction imposed on them @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to derive the soliton solutions for the integrable hierarchy of equations related to ( [ 2hfe ] ) and analyse the interactions between them . in this sense",
    "this paper is a natural continuation of our previous papers @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we start with some basic facts to be used further in paper .",
    "firstly we describe the hierarchy of nonlinear equations related to ( [ 2hfe ] ) in terms of recursion operators .",
    "then we outline the spectral properties of the relevant lax operator and formulate direct scattering problem .",
    "the spectrum of scattering operator @xmath0 consists of a continuous and a discrete parts . as a result of the @xmath14 reductions @xmath0 possesses two configurations of discrete eigenvalues : generic ones , coming in quadruplets @xmath15 , @xmath16 and purely imaginary ones coming as doublets @xmath17 .    in section 3",
    "we derive the 1-soliton solutions for the nlees of the hierarchy .",
    "for this to be done we apply the zakharov - shabat dressing method @xcite with a rational dressing factor with 2 simple poles . due to the action of reductions we have two types of 1-soliton solutions : quadruplet solitons to correspond to 4 eigenvalues and doublet ones to correspond to 2 eigenvalues respectively .",
    "we present explicit expressions for these two types of one - soliton solutions . in order to construct general multisoliton solutions",
    "we discuss two different purely algebraic constructions : by using a multiple pole dressing factor and by applying `` one - soliton '' dressing factors several times consecutively .",
    "it turns out that the properties of the 1-soliton solutions to nlees with even and odd dispersion laws differ drastically .",
    "for example , the 1-soliton solutions for nlees with even dispersion laws are _ not _ traveling waves .",
    "even the doublet soliton of eq .",
    "( [ 2hfe ] ) exhibits two maxima ( resp .",
    "minima ) for @xmath18 ( resp . for @xmath19 ) which first come closer to each other and then move away , one to @xmath20 and the other to @xmath21 as time goes to @xmath22 . their velocity , as well as their amplitudes are time dependent .",
    "these properties are similar to the ones of the boomerons and trappons discovered by calogero and degasperis @xcite . at the same time the soliton solutions to the nlees with odd dispersion laws ( e.g. the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ nee2 ] ) ) behave as standard solitons , i.e. they are traveling waves .",
    "section 4 is dedicated to interactions of quadruplet soliton solutions for the nlee with odd dispersion laws . in order to do this",
    "we use the classical method of zakharov and shabat , see the monographs @xcite for a detailed exposition .",
    "namely , we calculate the limits of the @xmath3-soliton solutions for @xmath4 assuming that all solitons move with different velocities . in this way",
    "we establish that the solitons preserve their velocities and amplitudes ; the only effect of their interaction consists in shifts of the relative mass center and the phase of solitons .",
    "we provide explicit expressions for these shifts in terms of the poles @xmath23 of the dressing factors .    in section 5",
    "we briefly discuss the conservation laws of the nlee and finish with some conclusions .",
    "in this section we shall expose in brief some basic facts on lax operators and direct scattering problem for the integrable hierarchy of the equation ( [ 2hfe ] ) . in doing this",

    "the lax operators are subject to the following @xmath14 reductions : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and the operation @xmath34 is defined as follows @xmath35 due to reduction ( [ red1 ] ) the matrix coefficients of the lax pair are hermitian matrices . on the other hand reduction ( [ red2 ] ) represents an action of cartan s involutive automorphism which defines the symmetric space @xmath2 , see @xcite .",

    "in particular , @xmath28 is written as : @xmath42 the potential @xmath28 is required to obey the following conditions :    1",
    ".   the eigenvalues of @xmath28 are @xmath43 , i.e. the potential satisfies the characteristic equation @xmath44 .",
    "2 .   the function @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a schwartz type function , i.e. it is infinitely smooth and tends to @xmath47 faster than any polynomial when @xmath48 .",
    "the grading ( [ grading ] ) means that any function @xmath49 with values in @xmath50 can be split as follows : @xmath51 let us define the killing form for @xmath50 as follows : @xmath52 then each component @xmath53 splits into a term commuting with @xmath28 and its orthogonal complement with respect to the killing form @xmath54 as a simple consequence of condition 1 above @xmath28 and @xmath55 are normalized as follows : @xmath56 therefore the coefficients @xmath57 and @xmath58 are given by the following equalities @xmath59    the zero curvature condition @xmath24 = 0 $ ] for the pair ( [ lax1 ] ) , ( [ lax2 ] ) leads to certain recurrence relations for the matrix coefficients of @xmath0 and @xmath25 , see @xcite .",
    "resolving them allows one to express @xmath40 in terms of @xmath28 and its @xmath60-derivatives of order up to @xmath61 . since the maximal order term in the operator @xmath25 must commute with @xmath28 there exists two options : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are constants .",

    "as we mentioned in the previous section the inverse scattering method is tightly related to riemann - hilbert problem .",
    "the riemann - hilbert problem possesses two types of solutions : regular ones ( without singularities ) and singular ones .",
    "singular solutions can be generated by dressing regular solutions with a factor which has prescribed singularities .",
    "the simplest types of singularities are first order poles and zeroes .",
    "it can be proven that they correspond to poles of the resolvent of @xmath0 .",
    "hence they are discrete eigenvalues of the lax operator ( [ lax1 ] ) .",
    "the discrete eigenvalues of @xmath0 form orbits of the reduction group @xmath1 .",
    "there exist two types of orbits : generic orbits containing quadruplets of eigenvalues @xmath121 and degenerate orbits consisting of two imaginary eigenvalues @xmath122 ( doublets ) .",
    "there is a very deep connection between singular solutions to riemann - hilbert problem and soliton solutions to the corresponding nonlinear problem . in the present section",
    "we are going to analyze the soliton solutions to the system ( [ nlee ] ) .",
    "for this to be done , we are going to apply the dressing method proposed in @xcite and developed in @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that the nlee ( [ nlee ] ) has two types of @xmath123-soliton solutions : doublet soliton to be connected with two imaginary discrete eigenvalues of @xmath0 and quadruplet soliton connected to 4 eigenvalues .",
    "the dressing method is an indirect method for solving a nlee possessing a lax representation .",
    "this means that it allows one to generate a solution to the nlee starting from a known one .",
    "let us assume we know a solution @xmath124 of ( [ nlee ] ) and a fundamental solution @xmath125 of the auxiliary linear problems @xmath126 then one constructs another function @xmath127 , where @xmath128 .",
    "this function is a common solution to @xmath129 where the potential @xmath130 is to be found . from ( [ bare_lax ] ) and ( [ dressed_lax ] ) it follows that the dressing factor @xmath131 satisfies the following equations : @xmath132    we also assume that the dressing factor is regular at @xmath133 .",
    "then from ( [ eq : dress - eq ] ) one can derive the following relation between @xmath134 and @xmath135 : @xmath136 this equation will play a central role in our further considerations since it allows one to generate a new solution to ( [ nlee ] ) from the given one @xmath137 .    due to the reduction conditions ( [ red1 ] ) , ( [ red2 ] ) the dressing factor obeys the symmetries : @xmath138    in order to obtain a nontrivial dressing we choose @xmath139 as a rational function is @xmath103-independent",
    "then it does not depend on @xmath60 and @xmath100 either .",
    "thus ( [ eq : dress - tr ] ) produces simply a unitary transformation of @xmath137 which is not essential because of @xmath140 gauge symmetry of the model .",
    "] of @xmath103 with a minimal number of simple poles . at first we shall consider the case when these poles are generic complex numbers .",
    "hence the dressing factor looks as follows : @xmath141 where @xmath142 , @xmath143 .",
    "it is evident that the reduction condition ( [ eq : fas - invol ] ) is fulfilled . on the other hand ( [ eq : her - invol ] ) leads to the conclusion that @xmath144    the identity @xmath145 must hold for any @xmath103 .",
    "therefore after equating the residue at @xmath146 to 0 one gets the equation : @xmath147 the rest of algebraic relations can be reduced to ( [ eq : dress - m ] ) due to the symmetry conditions ( [ red1 ] ) , ( [ red2 ] ) .",
    "the residue @xmath148 ought to be singular since otherwise it should be proportional to @xmath149 and the dressing becomes trivial .",
    "it suffices to consider the case @xmath150 .",
    "then @xmath148 can be decomposed in the following manner : @xmath151 after substituting this representation into ( [ eq : dress - m ] ) one derives a linear system for the @xmath152-vector @xmath153 : @xmath154 where we have used the notation @xmath155 , @xmath156 .",
    "the solution of ( [ eq : n ] ) reads : @xmath157 .",
    "indeed , it is evident that a rescaling @xmath158 with any complex @xmath159 does not change the matrix @xmath148 .",
    "taking into account the ansatz ( [ eq : dress - anz1 ] ) one can rewrite ( [ eq : dress - tr ] ) as : @xmath160 notice that the dressing procedure preserves the matrix structure of @xmath0 since the factor @xmath161 is a block - diagonal matrix .",
    "we have expressed all quantities needed in terms of @xmath162 and now it remains to find @xmath162 itself .",
    "for that purpose we rewrite equations ( [ eq : dress - eq ] ) , ( [ eq : dress - eqa ] ) in the form : @xmath163 it is obviously satisfied at @xmath164 . after equating the residues of ( [ eq : dress - eql1 ] ) at @xmath165",
    "to @xmath47 we obtain a set of differential equations @xmath166 taking into account ( [ eq : dress - m ] ) the equations above can be reduced to @xmath167 for some arbitrary function @xmath168 .",
    "at this point we recall that the vectors in the decomposition ( [ m_decomp])are not uniquely determined .",
    "indeed , the operation @xmath169 and @xmath170 for any nondegenerate @xmath171 matrix @xmath172 produces another decomposition of @xmath148 .",
    "it is not hard to see that it is always possible to choose @xmath172 in such a way that @xmath173 is fulfilled .",
    "thus from ( [ pde_m ] ) it follows that @xmath174 is proportional to some fundamental solution @xmath125 of the bare linear problem , namely @xmath175 is a constant vector of integration . the new solution @xmath176 of ( [ nlee ] ) and the solution @xmath177 of the corresponding linear system are parameterized by a complex number @xmath178 and a complex @xmath152-vector @xmath179 .",
    "thus we have proved the following proposition :    let @xmath180 be a solution of ( [ nlee ] ) and @xmath125 be a common solution to ( [ bare_lax ] ) .",
    "let also @xmath178 be a complex number to fulfill @xmath142 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "then the matrix - valued function @xmath183 defined by ( [ l_1 ] ) where @xmath184 is determined by ( [ n ] ) and ( [ m_psi ] ) is a solution to ( [ nlee ] ) as well .",
    "the corresponding fundamental solution @xmath177 of ( [ dressed_lax ] ) is given by @xmath185 where @xmath139 is determined by ( [ eq : dress - anz1 ] ) , ( [ m_decomp ] ) , ( [ n ] ) and ( [ m_psi ] ) .",
    "@xmath74    let us now consider the case when the poles of the dressing factor are imaginary , i.e. we have : @xmath186 then @xmath187 has the same poles as @xmath188 and therefore the equality @xmath189 already contains second order poles . in this case the natural requirement of vanishing of the matrix coefficients before @xmath190 and @xmath191 leads to the algebraic relations : @xmath192 as before in order to obtain a nontrivial result @xmath148 is required to be a degenerate matrix , i.e. decomposition ( [ m_decomp ] ) holds true",
    ". then relation ( [ algsys_m2 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath193 relation ( [ algsys_m1 ] ) in its turn can be easily reduced to the following linear system for 3-vector @xmath194 @xmath195 by introducing some auxiliary real function @xmath196 .",
    "that linear system allows one to express @xmath194 through @xmath197 and @xmath196 , namely : @xmath198 in order to find @xmath162 and @xmath196 we turn back to the equations ( [ eq : dress - eql1 ] ) .",
    "vanishing of the second order poles in ( [ eq : dress - eql1 ] ) leads to the conclusion that @xmath199 where @xmath200 is a constant nonzero @xmath152-vector . after substituting ( [ m_d ] ) into ( [ algsys_m2a ] ) and taking into account ( [ red1 ] )",
    "one convinces himself that the components of the polarization vector @xmath201 are no longer independent but satisfy the constraint : @xmath202    the vanishing condition of the first order poles leads to some differential constraint on @xmath203 which is integrated to give : @xmath204 where @xmath205 is a costant of integration .",
    "thus to calculate the soliton solution itself one just substitutes the result for @xmath206 and @xmath207 into @xmath148 and uses formula ( [ l_1 ] ) .",
    "as it is seen the new solution is parametrized by the polarization vector @xmath179 , the real number @xmath208 and the pole @xmath209 .",

    "we are going to consider the generation of a quadruplet soliton first .",

[ fig : uv],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]     and position of the maxima @xmath310 of solution ( [ eq : kink2 ] ) as a functions of @xmath100 . here",

    "here @xmath311 , @xmath297 and @xmath291 .",
    "[ fig : vel],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]      as we have already mentioned the dressing procedure can be applied several times consequently .",
    "thus after dressing the @xmath123-soliton solution one derives a @xmath312-soliton solution , after dressing the @xmath312-soliton solution one obtains a @xmath152-soliton solution and so on .",
    "of course , in doing this one is allowed to apply either of dressing factors ( [ eq : dress - anz1 ] ) and ( [ eq : dress - anz1a ] ) .",
    "therefore the multisoliton obtained will be a certain combination of quadruplet and doublet solitons .",
    "another way of derivation the multisoliton solution consists in using a dressing factor with a proper number of poles : @xmath313 as it follows from ( [ phi_gen ] ) the multisoliton solution obtained will be a mixture of @xmath314 quadruplet solitons and @xmath315 doublet ones . in order to determine the residues of @xmath188 one follows basically the same steps as in the case of a @xmath312-poles dressing factor",
    "firstly , the identity @xmath189 implies that the residues of @xmath188 and @xmath187 fulfill some algebraic restrictions .",
    "for example , the condition @xmath316 for vanishing of the residue of @xmath317 at @xmath318 leads to the following algebraic restrictions : @xmath319=0 .",

    "we can express @xmath330 and @xmath331 through all @xmath332 , @xmath333 and @xmath334 and that way determine the dressing factor in terms of the latter .",

    "thus we have proved that the dressing factor in the multiple poles case is determined if one knows the initial fundamental solution @xmath338 .",

    "in this section we aim to study the interactions of solitons we have derived . we shall restrict ourselves with quadruplet solitons for nlees with odd dispersion laws .",

    "the only effect of the interaction consists in shifting the center of mass and the initial phase of the solitons .",
    "the 1-soliton dressing factor corresponding to the quadruplet case with poles at @xmath343 is given by : @xmath344 the residues @xmath345 are determined by the following equalities @xmath346    let us now outline the alternative procedure for constructing the @xmath3-soliton solutions of the nlee ( [ nlee ] ) .",
    "the idea is to apply subsequently @xmath3 times the the one - soliton dressing . for simplicity",
