    "for isomerization on this model potential energy surface , which has multiple ( four ) symmetry equivalent minima , analysis of the phase space structure in the vicinity of the index two saddle enables a rigorous distinction to be made between concerted crossing ( `` hilltop crossing '' ) isomerizing trajectories and those trajectories that are not concerted ( potentially sequentially isomerizing ) @xcite . our normal form",
    "based procedure for sampling the ds enables us to determine phase points lying on concerted crossing trajectories . numerical propagation forwards and backwards in time shows that such trajectories do indeed have the properties intuitively associated with the concerted isomerizing pathway .",
    "[ sec : summary ] concludes .",
    "we begin by considering the normal form in the neighborhood of an equilibrium point of saddle- @xmath3-saddle - center-@xmath3-center stability type , where there are @xmath0 saddle degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) and @xmath11 center degrees - of - freedom ( eq .  ) .",
    "we assume the usual non - resonance condition on the eigenvalues of the matrix associated with the linearization of the hamiltonian vector field about the equilibrium point ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , we assume that the purely imaginary eigenvalues satisfy the non - resonance condition @xmath24 for any @xmath25-vector of integers @xmath26 with _ not all _ the @xmath27 ( that is , @xmath28 ) and the real eigenvalues satisfy the ( independent ) non - resonance condition @xmath29 for any @xmath0-vector of integers @xmath30 with _ not all _ the @xmath27 , @xmath31 . in this case",
    "the normal form transformation transforms the hamiltonian to an even order polynomial in the variables    [ ndof_ints ] @xmath32    in other words , we can express the normal form hamiltonian as : @xmath33 with associated hamilton s equations :    [ nf_hameq ] @xmath34    where we have defined the frequencies    @xmath35    where @xmath36 and it can be verified by a direct calculation that the @xmath37 , @xmath38 , are integrals of the motion for .",
    "the integrability of the normal form equations provides us with a very straightforward way of characterizing the dynamics in a neighborhood of the index @xmath0 saddle .",
    "the coordinates @xmath39 , @xmath31 , describe saddle - type or ` reaction dynamics ' , and the dynamics in the @xmath0 saddle planes can be further characterized by the _ saddle integrals _ , @xmath40 , @xmath31 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath39 , @xmath41 , describe bounded motions ( center - type dynamics ) or ` bath modes ' , which can be further characterized by integrals @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "we now introduce a canonical transformation of the saddle variables @xcite .",
    "passage of trajectories over the saddle is more naturally described in terms of these new coordinates , and computation of codimension one dividing surfaces for index @xmath0 saddles is also facilitated .",
    "the transformation is given by :    [ trans1 ] @xmath42    with inverse    [ inv_trans1 ] @xmath43    the transformation of variables given by eq .",
    ", where @xmath31 , and the remaining variables are transformed by the identity transformation , is canonical .",
    "the variables @xmath44 , @xmath45 , are naturally identified with physical configuration space coordinates in the vicinity of the saddle .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by eq .",
    ", with action variables    [ ndof_ints_2 ] @xmath46    and hamilton s equations then take the following form :    [ nf_hameq_2 ] @xmath47      as noted previously @xcite , for @xmath48 the @xmath49 dimensional surface : @xmath50 is a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold ( nhim ) in the energy surface @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , this nhim has @xmath52 dimensional stable and unstable manifolds ( within the fixed energy surface ) .",
    "note that these stable and unstable manifolds are codimension one in the energy surface only for @xmath53 , i.e. , index one saddles .",
    "nevertheless , in the construction of dividing surfaces for index @xmath0 saddles we will see that the nhim ( but not its stable and unstable manifolds ) plays a similar role for all @xmath0 .",
    "the case @xmath54 , i.e. a @xmath2 degree - of - freedom system with an index @xmath2 saddle requires special consideration . in this case",
    "the nhim corresponds to an equilibrium point and exists _ only _ on the @xmath55 energy surface .",
    "thus , to get a non - trivial nhim existing for @xmath56 we must have @xmath48 .      here",
    "we briefly address some of the issues associated with the accuracy of the normal form .",
    "the transformation to normal form is implemented by an algorithm that operates in an iterative fashion by simplifying terms in the taylor expansion about the equilibrium point order by order , i.e. , the order @xmath57 terms are normalized , then the order @xmath58 terms are normalized , etc @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is such that normalization at order @xmath57 does not affect any of the lower order terms ( which have already been normalized ) .",
    "the point here is that although the algorithm can be carried out to arbitrarily high order , in practice we must stop the normalization ( i.e. , truncate the hamiltonian ) at some order @xmath57 , after which we make a restriction to some neighborhood of the saddle in which the resulting computations achieve some desired accuracy .",
    "it is therefore necessary to determine the accuracy of the normal form as a power series expansion truncated at order @xmath57 in a neighborhood of the equilibrium point by comparing the dynamics associated with the normal form to the dynamics of the original system .",
    "there are several independent tests that can be carried out to verify accuracy of the normal form , such as the following :    * examine the extent to which integrals associated with the normal form are conserved along trajectories of the full hamiltonian ( the integrals will be constant on trajectories of the normal form hamiltonian ) .",
    "* check invariance of specific invariant manifolds ( e.g. , the nhim , its stable and unstable manifolds , the energy surface ) under dynamics determined by the full hamiltonian .    both of these tests require us to use the transformation between the original coordinates and the normal form coordinates .",
    "software for computing the normal form as well as the transformation ( and inverse transformation ) between the original coordinates and the normal form coordinates can be downloaded from http://lacms.maths.bris.ac.uk/publications/software/index.html .",
    "specific examples where the accuracy of the normal form and its relation to @xmath57 , the fixed neighborhood of the saddle , and the constancy of integrals of the truncated normal form on trajectories of the full hamiltonian can be found in refs .",
    "a general discussion of accuracy of the normal form can be found in ref .  .",
    "in this section we introduce the notion of crossing trajectories . _",
    "crossing _ trajectories pass through a neighborhood of the index @xmath0 saddle in such a way that _ all _ the saddle coordinates @xmath44 change sign , and constitute a dynamically well - defined subset of trajectories .",
    "our treatment of crossing trajectories provides an excellent illustration of the power of the normal form ( nf ) and the utility of the integrals of the motion in analyzing dynamics in the vicinity of the saddle .",
    "the definition of crossing trajectories given here is purely local , in that it relies on the values of the integrals computed using the nf in the vicnity of the saddle . in our discussion of the isomerization dynamics for a model",
    "multi - well system given below in sec .",
    "[ sec : model_potential ] , we establish a connection between the local crossing property and the more global mechanistic notion of _ concerted _ ( as opposed to sequential ) isomerization trajectories ; in this context , the crossing trajectories defined here are usefully described as _",
    "concerted crossing _",
    "( cc ) trajectories .    in the normal form",
    "coordinate system the ` crossing ' of a saddle is analyzed by considering only the saddle degrees - of - freedom , @xmath59 , @xmath31 , since the remaining coordinates remain bounded .",
    "crossing occurs when all coordinates @xmath44 , @xmath31 , change sign as the trajectory passes through a neighborhood of the index @xmath0 saddle .",
    "whether or not a given coordinate @xmath44 changes sign depends on the value of the integral @xmath40 . if @xmath44 changes sign in the vicinity of the saddle then @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath61 then @xmath44 is zero or evolves to zero either in forward or negative time ( depending on the initial condition ) .",
    "we consider the boundary of the region of crossing trajectories , characterised by @xmath61 in more detail below .",
    "more precisely , crossing and other trajectories are characterized as follows :    1 .",
    "if @xmath62 for _ all _ @xmath63 , then the trajectory is a crossing trajectory .",
    "2 .   if @xmath64 and @xmath65 for _ all _ @xmath63 , then the trajectory is on the nhim and is not a crossing trajectory .",
    "3 .   if @xmath64 for any @xmath63 and @xmath66 for any point on the trajectory then @xmath66 for all points on the trajectory ( for finite time ) ; the coordinate @xmath44 therefore does not change sign , and the trajectory is not a crossing trajectory .",
    "the signs of the integrals provide a rather coarse descriptor for crossing trajectories . in ref .",
    "a symbolic description of saddle crossing trajectories for index @xmath13 saddles was introduced based on the sign change of the @xmath44 .",
    "this symbolic description distinguishes all qualitatively distinct classes of crossing trajectories .",
    "here we recall the discussion of the symbolic description of crossing trajectories given in ref .  .",
    "consider the index @xmath13 case . the symbolic description of the behavior of a trajectory as it passes through a neighborhood of the index 2 saddle with respect to the coordinates @xmath67 , is expressed by the following four symbols , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 . here",
    "@xmath73 , @xmath74 , refers to the `` initial '' sign of @xmath75 as it enters the neighborhood of the index 2 saddle and @xmath76 , @xmath74 , refer to the `` final '' sign of @xmath75 , as it leaves the neighborhood of the index 2 saddle .",
    "for example , trajectories of type @xmath77 pass over the barrier from @xmath78 to @xmath79 , but remain on the side of the barrier with @xmath80 .",
    "based on the number of distinct sequences of length four of @xmath81 and @xmath82 , there are @xmath83 qualitatively distinct classes of trajectory , however , there are only four types of trajectories for which there is a change of sign of _ both _ coordinates @xmath84 and @xmath85 as they pass through a neighborhood of the index 2 saddle , and these have symbolic descriptions @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we will see that this symbolic description of crossing trajectories can be directly related to the geometry of the dividing surface .",
    "as noted previously @xcite , codimension one surfaces separate the different types of trajectory . for index 2",
    "saddles these are the codimension one invariant manifolds . given by @xmath90 , @xmath91 ( i.e. , @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) .",
    "for example , the codimension one surface @xmath90 forms the boundary between trajectories of type @xmath94 and @xmath95 , and so on .",
    "an obvious generalization of this symbolic construction can be carried out for the case of index @xmath0 saddles , @xmath96 , where there are @xmath97 possible classes of trajectory .",
    "an essential component of the analysis of reaction dynamics from the phase space perspective is the construction of a dividing surface ( ds ) through which all reactant trajectories must pass , and which ( locally ) has the essential no - recrossing property @xcite . in this section",
    "we discuss construction of a codimension one ( within the energy surface ) ds for an index @xmath0 saddle using the equations of motion associated with the normal form hamiltonian of sec .",
    "[ sec : ndof ] .",
    "this construction again demonstrates the utility of an analysis in terms of the ` physical ' saddle coordinates @xmath44 .",
    "in addition to constructing the ds , using the normal form we are able to ( locally ) classify reactive trajectories , thereby obtaining a rigorous phase space characterization of the subset of barrier crossing trajectories associated with concerted isomerization dynamics .",
    "we define a measure of the distance from the origin ( i.e. , the saddle ) in the configuration space of the saddle degrees - of - freedom as : @xmath98 the dividing surface we define contains the set of phase space points corresponding to the minimum distance from the origin attained by crossing trajectories . at any turning point in the variable @xmath99",
    "we have @xmath100 this equation defines a critical point for @xmath99 , but it is in fact a minimum since @xmath101 and where we have used @xmath102 for dynamics under the normal form hamiltonian .",
    "note that @xmath103 precisely when @xmath104 , i.e. , it is zero on the nhim .",

    "we consider the case of an index 2 saddle for a system with 2 dof .",

    "such visualization provides insight into the crossing dynamics for an index 2 saddle , and we therefore discuss this topic in some detail .",
    "moreover , we will see that the dividing surface in the quadratic hamiltonian case plays an important role in our algorithm for sampling the dividing surface associated with the full normal form for general ( non - quadratic ) hamiltonians .",

    "we wish to sample trajectories having prescribed dynamical character ( cc and non - cc ) for the 2 dof system with hamiltonian using the ds specified by with crossing trajectories subject to the constraint .",
    "the cc trajectories constitute a dynamically well - defined subset of trajectories that are associated with concerted well - to - well transitions . isomerizing trajectories that enter the vicinity of an index @xmath0 saddle and which are not crossing ( non - cc ) trajectories",
    "are potentially associated with sequential well - to - well transformations .",

    "this is done by appropriate scaling of the momenta @xmath244 .",
    "each calculation of the energy error involves a separate iteration to obtain the nonlinear frequencies @xmath214 ; for the calculations reported here a single iteration proves sufficient to achieve convergence .",
    "a further difficulty arises as a consequence of the inherent inaccuracy of the truncated nf transformations .",
    "if we solve for phase points with fixed nf energy as defined by and then use the nf coordinate transformation to map the point into the original physical coordinates , the resulting point obtained no longer lies exactly on the energy surface defined by the original physical hamiltonian ; the associated error increases with distance from the saddle .",
    "we must therefore determine the value of @xmath220 yielding a nf point which , after transformation , lies on the energy surface defined by the original hamiltonian ( expressed in the original physical coordinates ) .",

    "the results shown in figs [ fig : cc_traj_0.01][fig : cc_traj_0.5 ] are noteworthy in several respects .",
    "first , it is clear that , for all three values of the energy considered , the symbolic classification of trajectories as obtained using the nf in the vicinity of the index-2 saddle corresponds precisely to the observed dynamical behavior of the numerically integrated trajectories .",
    "that is , the nf enables us to sample a subset of trajectories of a given dynamical type , e.g. , concerted crossing .",
    "second , we note that , although the ensemble of cc trajectories for a given energy appears to consist of two disjoint pencils or bundles , the set of initial consitions is in fact connected ( there is a cc trajectory passing through the origin ) .",
    "the form of the configuration space projections of the various trajectory classes is by no means inuitively obvious : at all three energies studied , cc trajectories tend to be concentrated away from the hilltop itself .",
    "the non - cc trajectories passing through the vicinity of the index 2 saddle tend to ` bounce ' off the saddles as they pass between the wells , while cc trajectories appear to ` graze ' the hilltop .    as mentioned previously ,",
    "the boundary between cc and non - cc trajectories on the extended dividing surface is composed of those points on the ds satisfying @xmath109 and/or @xmath110 .",
    "projected into configuration space , the boundary consists of a number of lines emanating from the origin . in fig .",
    "[ fig : boundary_0.01 ] we show the projection into configuration space of a segment of a boundary between cc and non - cc trajectories defined by the condition @xmath110 with @xmath254 and @xmath255 .",
    "each phase point on the boundary is propagated forward and backward in time .",
    "it can be seen that trajectories associated with boundary points start in the lower left hand well , pass through the vicinity of the saddle and end up ( at short times ) tending towards the vertical axis , i.e. , neither left ( non - cc ) nor right ( cc ) .",
    "again , the phase points on the boundary are obtained using the nf , yet show precisely the expected dynamical behavior when propagated numerically .",
    "lastly , it is natural to consider the fraction of cc trajectories in a given ensemble at a prescribed energy . to provide an unambigous determination of this quantity",
    ", we must carefully define the relevant ensemble , such as we have done above in terms of the sampling procedure on the ds , and also specify the relevant weighting factor ( measure ) for trajectories . as the coordinates @xmath174 used to parametrize",
    "the ds are not canonical coordinates , a weighting factor enters that is a non - trivial function of @xmath174 . rather than calculate the fraction of cc trajectories by sampling the ds using this weight function , in the next subsection we consider a different sampling procedure where trajectories are initiated on the plane @xmath256 with @xmath257 .",
    "in this case the associated density at constant energy is just the natural measure ( area ) in the @xmath258 plane .",
    "we now study the isomerization dynamics in the concerted crossing regime using an approach complementary to that of the previous subsection .",
    "these computations provide additional insight into the way in which the presence of the index-2 saddle affects trajectories in the neighborhood of the saddle , and further confirm the accuracy of the nf in the vicinity of the index 2 saddle .",
    "initial conditions are chosen as follows . in the configuration space @xmath259",
    ", we define a regular grid of points along the line @xmath260 in an interval symmetric about @xmath261 . at each point",
    "@xmath259 along this line , a number of momentum pairs @xmath262 are chosen such that the phase space points @xmath263 lie on the fixed energy surface , @xmath264 .",
    "we consider the same 3 energies as in the previous subsection , @xmath265 , @xmath266 and @xmath267 , and we set @xmath268 , so that trajectories start out moving from the lower to the upper half of the potential ( the potential is symmetric by construction ) .    a symbolic code can be assigned to each initial condition in either of two ways .",
    "trajectories can be integrated forward and backward in time until the first well is reached . in practice",
    "this means that we integrate trajectories until a turning point is reached in either of the coordinates @xmath269 . in forward time",
    "the trajectory can enter one of 2 possible wells , and in backward time the trajectory can enter 2 possible wells , so that there are 4 qualitatively different type of trajectories . using our symbolic classification @xcite , the trajectory @xmath270 , where @xmath271 , @xmath272 , @xmath273 , denotes the trajectory that passes from well @xmath274 in the immediate past to the well @xmath275 in the immediate future .",
    "each initial condition on the horizontal line can therefore be labelled according to its symbolic description @xmath270 , i.e. , the first well visited in the past and future , as determined by the exact trajectory dynamics .",
    "we can also use the nf to classify phase points in the @xmath276 plane , and this symbolic classification can be compared with the trajectory results .",
    "initial conditions at constant energy with @xmath277 , @xmath278 are uniquely specified by the values of the phase space variables @xmath279 .",
    "we therefore assign the symbolic trajectory code ( 4 possibilities ) as a function of coordinates @xmath279 .",
    "initial conditions are sampled uniformly in the @xmath258 plane .",
    "our results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : q2p2_f ] in which we plot the fraction @xmath280 of crossing trajectories as a function of coordinate @xmath227 .",
    "results are shown for three energies @xmath281 , @xmath266 and @xmath267 across the interval @xmath282 .",
    "this range of the coordinate @xmath283 corresponds approximately to the constraint @xmath284 employed when sampling the ds as described in the previous subsection . on the same graph",
    "we show the corresponding trajectory fractions determined by taking each initial condition , converting it to nf coordinates , and using the nf to predict the symbolic trajectory code . in figure",
    "[ fig : q2p2_f ] the sample spacing for trajectory initialisation was @xmath285 , while for the faster normal form sampling we used a 5 times finer spacing , @xmath286 .",
    "use of the nf results in a smoother curve . if the same sampling spacing is used as for the trajectory calculations , the nf results are essentially identical to those obtained by trajectory integration .",
    "discrepencies between the trajectory and nf results are most pronounced near the boundaries of the interval , and this is not unexpected as the accuracy of the nf presumably deteriorates as one moves away from the saddle .",
    "what is perhaps striking about our results is the size of the region of the @xmath283 axis over which the nf predictions do accurately match the trajectory results .",

    "hamilton s equations are given by :    [ hameq_3a ] @xmath293    for our numerical calculations we use bath parameters @xmath294 , @xmath295 and set @xmath296 .",
    "we now consider the effect of additional degrees of freedom on the dynamics , in particular , our ability to sample concerted crossing trajectories on the ( extended ) ds for the 4 dof system - bath hamiltonian , eq .  .",
    "the energy shell for the 4 dof system - bath model is 7 dimensional , while the ds is 6 dimensional .",
    "fully sampling the ds according to the procedures described above is a numerically intensive task . for purposes of illustration",
    ", we demonstrate that computation of the nf for the 4 dof model allows us to sample cc trajectories on the ds , and that bundles of such trajectories , when projected into the @xmath245 subspace , appear simply as ` fattened ' versions of the 2dof saddle trajectories described above with an appropriate value of the saddle energy .",
    "this inherent apparent simplicity of the system - bath dynamics is a consequence of the integrability of the nf in the vicinity of the saddle .    in order to sample the ds , we first set the saddle energy @xmath297 ( no excitation in center modes ) and sample phase space coordinates in the saddle planes ; for each saddle plane point we sample phase points in the center dof setting @xmath298 , @xmath299 , @xmath300 , and @xmath301 , and scale the center dof coordinates and momenta to obtain a fixed value of the total energy @xmath302 .",

    "each initial condition in the saddle planes is therefore associated with a ` bundle ' of trajectories for the 4 dof full system .",
    "figure [ fig : ccb_traj_0.1_0.5 ] shows analogous results for larger system - bath coupling parameters @xmath304 . for the larger coupling we obtain a thicker bundle associated with the fiducial initial condition in the saddle planes .",
    "in this paper we have extended our earlier analysis of the phase space structure in the vicinity of an equilibrium point associated with an index @xmath0 saddles @xcite .",
    "we have shown that poincar - birkhoff normal form theory provides a constructive procedure for obtaining an integrable approximation to the full hamiltonian in the vicinity of the equilibrium , provided a generic non - resonance condition is satisfied independently for both the real eigenvalues and the complex eigenvalues of the matrix associated with the linearization of hamilton s equations about the index @xmath0 saddle . as a consequence there are @xmath0 independent integrals associated with the saddle degrees - of - freedom .",
    "these integrals provide a precise tool for classifying trajectories that pass through a neighborhood of the saddle .",
    "in particular , they provide a symbolic classification of the trajectories into @xmath97 distinct types of trajectory that pass through a neighborhood of the index @xmath0 saddle .",
    "the normal form also provides an algorithm for constructing a dividing surface , i.e. , a co - dimension one surface ( restricted to the energy surface ) through which all trajectories in a neighborhood of the index @xmath0 saddle must pass ( with the exception of a set of zero measure ) .",
    "we provide a parametrization of this dividing surface which , when using the integrals associated with the saddle degrees - of - freedom , can be sampled in such a way that we can choose initial conditions corresponding to any particular type of trajectory described by the symbolic classification .",
    "we illustrated our analytical and computational techniques by analyzing a problem that brings to light a fundamental mechanistic role played by index two saddles in chemical dynamics .",
    "namely , we consider isomerization on a potential energy surface with multiple symmetry equivalent minima . in the two degree - of - freedom example we computed the normal form and",
    "the dividing surface and showed that the different classes of reactive trajectories in the vicinity of the index two saddle ( for three different energies ) could be computed by our sampling routine .",
    "our procedure enables a rigorous definition of concerted crossing trajectories to be given in terms of local phase space structure .",
    "we then considered a simplified system - bath model ( one harmonic oscillator mode for each degree - of - freedom ) , and showed that our approach could be applied to this four degree - of - freedom system .",

    "<S> in this paper we continue our studies of the phase space geometry and dynamics associated with index @xmath0 saddles ( @xmath1 ) of the potential energy surface . using poincar - birkhoff normal form theory , we give an explicit formula for a `` dividing surface '' in phase space , i.e. a co - dimension one surface ( within the energy shell ) through which all trajectories that `` cross '' the region of the index @xmath0 saddle must pass . with a generic non - resonance assumption , the normal form provides @xmath0 ( approximate ) integrals that describe the saddle dynamics in a neighborhood of the index @xmath0 saddle . </S>",
    "<S> these integrals provide a symbolic description of all trajectories that pass through a neighborhood of the saddle . </S>",
    "<S> we give a parametrization of the dividing surface which is used as the basis for a numerical method to sample the dividing surface . </S>",
    "<S> our techniques are applied to isomerization dynamics on a potential energy surface having 4 minima ; two symmetry related pairs of minima are connected by low energy index one saddles , with the pairs themselves connected via higher energy index one saddles and an index two saddle at the origin . </S>",
    "<S> we compute and sample the dividing surface and show that our approach enables us to distinguish between concerted crossing ( `` hilltop crossing '' ) isomerizing trajectories and those trajectories that are not concerted crossing ( potentially sequentially isomerizing trajectories ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider the effect of additional `` bath modes '' on the dynamics , which is a four degree - of - freedom system . for this system </S>",
    "<S> we show that the normal form and dividing surface can be realized and sampled and that , using the approximate integrals of motion and our symbolic description of trajectories , we are able to choose initial conditions corresponding to concerted crossing isomerizing trajectories and ( potentially ) sequentially isomerizing trajectories . </S>"
