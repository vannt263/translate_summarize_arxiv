    "coupled nonlinear systems exhibit a plethora of different collective behavior such as partial or cluster synchronization @xcite , spatio - temporal patterns under delayed feedback control @xcite , and chimera states which consist of spatially coexisting domains of synchronized and unsynchronized dynamics @xcite .",
    "recently , special attention has been paid to the different types of oscillation quenching , amplitude death and oscillation death @xcite .",
    "amplitude death and oscillation death differ in the mechanisms by which they are induced : in coupled oscillator networks , the coupling between oscillators can stabilize an already existing homogeneous steady state which is unstable in the absence of coupling . this phenomenon is called _",
    "amplitude death_. in contrast , _ oscillation death _ requires the breaking of the system s symmetry : here inhomogeneous steady states are newly created as well as stabilized through a symmetry - breaking coupling between the oscillators . a combination of these two phenomena of spontaneous symmetry - breaking , chimera states and oscillation death , has recently been found in a paradigmatic model of nonlocally coupled supercritical hopf normal forms ( stuart - landau oscillators ) @xcite .",
    "the resulting patterns of coexisting coherent and incoherent inhomogeneous steady states occur in form of clusters of different size , and have been named _",
    "chimera death_. similar chimera death patterns have recently also been observed with global ( all - to - all ) coupling @xcite .",
    "oscillation death has been observed experimentally in many different systems , such as chemical reactors @xcite , chemical oscillators @xcite , chemical droplets @xcite , electronic circuits @xcite , or thermokinetic oscillators @xcite . there",
    "exist various biological applications , e.g.  neural networks @xcite , genetic oscillators @xcite , calcium oscillators @xcite or stem cell differentiation @xcite where it has been proposed as a basic mechanism for morphogenesis and cellular differentiation .",
    "consequently , there has also been theoretical interest in oscillation death and it has been shown to exist for special time - delayed @xcite and repulsive @xcite types of coupling as well as coupling through conjugate or dissimilar variables @xcite .",
    "however , research has mostly focussed on small numbers of coupled oscillators in networks with local or global coupling .",
    "the influence of nonlocal coupling on the onset of oscillation death and on the emergence of multi - cluster patterns in larger networks has not been investigated systematically , so far .",
    "it is possible to use the coupling range @xmath0 as a control parameter , e.g. , in a bidirectionally coupled ring of @xmath1 nodes .",
    "thus one can interpolate between the well - studied limit cases of local ( nearest neighbor , @xmath2 ) and global ( all - to - all , @xmath3 ) coupling .    in our present study ,",
    "we analyze the transition from completely synchronized oscillations to multi - cluster inhomogeneous steady state patterns ( oscillation death ) in networks of nonlocally coupled oscillators with symmetry - breaking coupling .",
    "we choose initial conditions which favor the emergence of spatially coherent clusters , in contrast to @xcite , where hybrid patterns with coexisting domains of spatially coherent and spatially incoherent steady states ( chimera death ) were analyzed .",
    "we investigate the effects of several factors on the occurrence of different oscillation death states both numerically and analytically .",
    "first , we use nonlocal coupling and thus cover the whole range between the limit cases of local and global coupling .",
    "second , we also vary the initial conditions , specified by cluster distributions , to find different coexisting spatial patterns for oscillation death .",
    "furthermore , we also vary the coupling strength , and combine all three variations . beside the regions of stability",
    ", we also find parameter regimes where the oscillation death state is transient , but persists for a long time .",
    "due to the coherent nature of the oscillation death patterns , we are able to predict analytically and with high precision the boundaries between different stability regimes .    this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ ii ] we introduce our model of nonlocally coupled oscillators and briefly summarize previous work on two coupled oscillators @xcite .",
    "our approach is numerical in the first step , and we observe two different types of oscillation death : transient as well as asymptotically stable . in section  [ iii ]",

    "consequently , for the oscillator @xmath129 , we find that the number of relevant links to the left is given by @xmath145 by reflection , the number of relevant links to the left of oscillator @xmath129 is the same as the number of relevant links to the right of oscillator @xmath146 .    in the next step , in order to reduce from @xmath74 oscillators to two oscillators , we calculate the _ mean relevant coupling _ of the whole cluster , and therefore consider each cluster as lumped into only one effective oscillator .",
    "we sum up the respective value of each oscillator within the cluster , and divide by the number of neighbors @xmath0 as well as by the number of oscillators @xmath74 to obtain a first approximation for the average coupling @xmath127 : @xmath147 this can be inserted into the threshold condition for stable oscillation death obtained in section  [ ii ] , @xmath148 . in total , for @xmath149 , @xmath138 , we find the threshold @xmath150 for the onset of oscillation death .",
    "note that the size of the system , i.e. , the total number of oscillators @xmath1 , does not appear in the threshold .",
    "we can compare this analytic mean - field result with the numerical simulations : for a coupling range @xmath0 which is of the same order of magnitude as the cluster size @xmath74 , or larger , the analytic and the numeric thresholds agree very well . for a coupling range",
    "@xmath0 which is small compared to the cluster size , we note that the analytic results give smaller thresholds than the simulations , see white diamonds in fig .",
    "[ fig : num2x50 ] .",
    "this suggests that the simplified mean - field model must be improved for this parameter regime .",
    "as mentioned above , the assumption that all oscillators within a cluster have the same radius and phase is not true in general and deviates from the numerical results .",
    "therefore , we aim for a correction term to the mean - field theory used above , depending on the coupling range @xmath0 and the cluster size @xmath74 .    in our reduced model , we replace the mean - field coupling @xmath126 by the corrected mean coupling @xmath151 , and it is the aim of this section to estimate the correction term @xmath152 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : branches ] we observed a deformation of the cluster shape ( branch splitting ) for small @xmath0 .",
    "the deformation is approximately linear , where the @xmath153- and the @xmath82-variable of the two corner oscillators of the cluster stay ( approximately ) the same .",
    "the values of the neighboring oscillators , proceeding inwards , either decrease or increase . seen from the left",
    ", there are @xmath154 oscillators which show a linear decrease / increase with respect to their left neighbor .",
    "to first order , it follows that there exists a plateau , where the oscillators have the same radius and phase . on the right we encounter an analogous linear increase or decrease , respectively .",
    "the cluster is reflection symmetric in the sense that the phenomenon is the same if we approach from the left or the right .",
    "this behavior is due to the fact that not all oscillators  feel \" the same coupling : the corner oscillators feel more or less oscillators from the other clusters than those in the middle , depending on the precise values of @xmath0 and @xmath74 .",
    "an exception are the values @xmath155 where the mean coupling coincides exactly with the coupling that every single oscillator feels ; thus no branch splitting effects occur ( fig .",
    "[ fig : branches]c ) .",
    "in particular , we can conclude that , for those @xmath0 , no correction term is necessary .    following the description above , the effect of the cluster deformation on the mean coupling is proportional to @xmath154 as well as proportional to the cluster size @xmath74 .",
    "overall , the significance of the correction term decreases as @xmath0 increases , since the more oscillators are coupled , the closer we are to the mean - field approximation .",
    "a simple intuitive ansatz is to assume a global @xmath156 dependence of the correction term .",
    "thus , to compensate the cluster deformation term , we need a prefactor @xmath157 to achieve the desired global @xmath156 dependence .",

    "furthermore , we also claim that it is independent of @xmath1 , since the single oscillators are not influenced by the circumference of the ring",

    "[ triplett ] for the system of two coupled oscillators .",

    "in addition to the asymptotically stable oscillation death states , we also find a region where oscillation death is transient : it persists for a long time but then disappears in favor of synchronized oscillations .",

    "we have analytically calculated a scenario leading from the transient behavior to the asymptotically stable oscillation death with the coupling strength serving as a bifurcation parameter . near the stabilizing hopf bifurcation",
    ", the calculated transient time goes to infinity which is in accordance with the numerical simulations .",
    "note that in this paper we have confined attention to spatially coherent clusters of inhomogeneous steady states . as shown in @xcite ,",
