    "the axisymmetric current - carrying string loops are governed by their tension and angular momentum .",
    "tension of the string loops prevents their expansion beyond some radius , while their worldsheet current introduces an angular momentum preventing them from collapse .",
    "originally , the cosmic strings were introduced as remnants of the phase transitions in the very early universe @xcite , or strings represented as superconducting vortices were considered in @xcite .",
    "however , the current - carrying string loops could represent also plasma exhibiting a string - like behaviour due to dynamics of the magnetic field lines @xcite , or due to the thin flux tubes of magnetized plasma simply described as 1d strings @xcite .    in recent studies",
    "it has been demonstrated that the current - carrying string loops moving axisymmetrically along the symmetry axis of the kerr or schwarzschildde  sitter black holes can have interesting direct astrophysical applications @xcite .",
    "for example , the transmutation effect related to the current - carrying string loops , i.e. , transmission of their oscillatory internal energy into energy of the translational motion , causes an outward - directed acceleration of the string loops in the gravitational field of stars or compact objects , as neutron stars , black holes , or naked singularities @xcite .",
    "such an effect can be important also for the electrically charged string loops moving in combined external gravitational and electromagnetic fields @xcite .    since acceleration of the string loops in the deep gravitational field of black holes or naked singularities",
    "can be extremely efficient , leading to ultra - relativistic escaping velocities of the string loops @xcite , the string loop transmutation can serve as a model of the formation of the ultra - relativistic jets observed in active galactic nuclei or galactic microquasars .",
    "the string loop transmutation model of collimated relativistic jets can thus be considered as an alternative to the standard model based on the blandford - znajek process @xcite , or recently proposed model of geodesic collimation of ultra - relativistic particles @xcite . for acceleration of jets escaping from the active galactic nuclei the cosmic repulsion",
    "can be also relevant behind the so called static radius @xcite .",
    "quite recently , it has been demonstrated that the string loops can be astrophysically relevant in situation inverse to the transmutation effect .",
    "small oscillations of the string loops around stable equilibrium positions in the equatorial plane of the kerr geometry can be considered in the lowest approximation as two uncoupled linear harmonic oscillators governing the radial and vertical oscillations of the string loop ",
    "the higher - order terms determine non - linear phenomena and subsequent transition to the quasi - periodic and chaotic oscillatory motion @xcite .",
    "the frequencies of the radial and vertical harmonic oscillations of the string loops are relevant also in the quasi - periodic stages of the motion and their radial profiles were given and discussed in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that frequencies of the string loop harmonic or quasi - harmonic oscillations can fit twin hf qpos observed with frequency ratio @xmath6 in three galactic microquasars grs  1915 + 105 , xte  1550 - 564 , gro  1655 - 40 , i.e , low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) systems containing a black hole @xcite .",
    "the radial profiles of the string loop oscillations qualitatively differ from those related to the radial and vertical oscillations of the geodesic , test particle motion in the kerr geometry , especially there is a crossing point of the radial and vertical frequencies in the kerr black hole spacetimes for the string loop oscillations , while for the test particle oscillations such a crossing is possible only in the kerr naked singularity spacetimes @xcite .",
    "this property of the radial profiles of the radial and vertical frequencies of the string loop oscillations is applied here to test the string loop oscillation model @xcite for fitting the special frequency set of hf qpos observed recently in the source xte j1701 - 407 that is a lmxb system containing a neutron star @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the external geometry of the neutron star can be appropriately approximated by the kerr geometry .",
    "the lmxbs can contain a black hole or a neutron star .",
    "the neutron star lmxbs are classified as _ z _ sources",
    "if they demonstrate high luminosities ( @xmath7 of eddington luminosity @xmath8 ) , and _ atoll _ sources if they demonstrate low luminosities ( @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "the source xte  j1701 - 407 has been discovered by the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) at june 2008 @xcite . since thermonuclear x - ray bursts",
    "were observed at the xte  j1701 - 407 source @xcite , we can conclude that it contains an accreting neutron star .",
    "the discovery of hf qpos at the xte j1701 - 407 source was first reported in @xcite where it was mentioned that it is one of the least luminous atoll sources , having the x - ray luminosity @xmath10 .",
    "later , it has been discovered that the source is a peculiar neutron star lmxb displaying all various types of the neutron star lmxb subclasses , i.e. , z - class , bright atoll and atoll @xcite    recently , a detailed analysis of the hf qpos in the source xte  j1701 - 407 has been reported in @xcite , being based on the whole ansamble of 58 rxte observations .",
    "the results are rather unexpected and very interesting , since a very special set of frequencies has been discovered at three of the whole ansamble of the rxte observations . in one of the three observational events",
    "a single hf qpo has been detected at a characteristic frequency @xcite f_(a)l = f_(a)u = 11535 .",
    "[ ff11 ] in the other two observations twin hf qpos has been detected at characteristic frequencies @xcite f_(b)l = 7405 , f_(b)u = 111217 , [ ff32a ] + f_(c)l = 74011 , f_(c)u = 10985 , [ ff32b ] where we use the index u for the upper and the index l for the lower of the twin frequencies observed simultaneously .",
    "the other details of the detected hf qpos , namely the fractional rms amplitudes and the quality factors , are presented in @xcite .",
    "we do not discuss them here , since we concentrate our attention on the observed frequencies only .    during the observations when the one - peak hf qpo has been detected ,",
    "a low - frequency qpo has been also detected at @xmath11  hz @xcite that is not considered in the following as we restrict our attention to the hf qpos .",
    "however , we plan to study the possibility that the low - frequency qpo could be related to `` rocking '' of a string loop around the symmetry axis .",
    "note that the hf ( khz ) qpos do not always appear as twin peaks , but only one peak is sometimes observed in the neutron star systems .",
    "if only one khz peak is detected , it could mean that the other peak is not detected for physical reasons , or because of limitations of detectors , such as low signal - to - noise .",
    "the physical reasons could block production of the second peak , or , as we assume here , frequencies of the two oscillatory modes coincide .",
    "the frequency set corresponding to the hf qpos detected in the xte  j1701 - 407 source is really of a special character among the hf qpos observed in the atoll sources , since a single hf qpo is combined with two twin hf qpos having the frequency ratio @xmath6 typical for microquasars .",
    "we shall use the special character of the radial profiles of the frequencies of the harmonic radial and vertical oscillations of axially symmetric string loops , namely the coincidence of these frequencies at a special radius @xcite , in order to fit quite naturally the single hf qpo observed in the source xte  j1701 - 407 .",
    "in our test of the string loop model for the case of the neutron star system xte  1701 - 407 we apply the kerr geometry to describe the external geometry of the neutron star , as the radial profiles of the radial and vertical string loop oscillation frequencies are given by analytic formulae in this geometry and enable relatively simple and elegant fitting procedure . however , we have to clear up the conditions enabling using of such a strong simplification for the external geometry of the neutron star .",
    "the rotating neutron stars can be conveniently described by the hartle - thorne geometry that is governed in its exterior part by three parameters : mass @xmath1 , dimensionless spin @xmath2 , and dimensionless quadrupole moment @xmath12 .",
    "the hartle - thorne theory can be applied for rotating neutron stars with rotation frequency smaller than the mass - shedding frequency ( @xmath13 ) and dimensionless spin @xmath14 @xcite . for @xmath15 and @xmath16 ,",
    "the external hartle - thorne geometry @xcite coincides with the kerr geometry with precision on the level of @xmath17 . for @xmath18",
    "these two geometries have very similar radial profiles of the metric coefficients , giving thus for astrophysical phenomena occurring in vicinity of such rotating neutron stars predictions with errors on the level lower than @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "recently a very important result has been obtained in @xcite where it has been demonstrated that for the whole variety of considered realistic equations of state enabling existence of massive neutron stars with @xmath20 , the hartle - thorne theory predicts @xmath21 , if the mass of the neutron star with a given rotation frequency is close to the maximum allowed for a given equation of state .",
    "we can see in figure 3 of @xcite that near the mass - maximum given by equations of state allowing for @xmath22 , the value of the characteristic parameter can be as low as @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , such near - maximum - mass neutron stars can be properly described by the kerr black hole geometry .",
    "the precision of the agreement of the external hartle  thorne and kerr geometries is sufficiently high ( with relative difference lower than @xmath24 ) , if the conditions @xmath25 and @xmath26 are satisfied @xcite .    for masses substantially lower than the maximum allowed by the realistic equations of state",
    ", the parameter @xmath27 can be relatively high  for @xmath28 there is @xmath29 in dependence on a concrete equation of state @xcite .",
    "we can see in figure 3 of @xcite that for the so called `` canonical '' neutron star mass @xmath30 , there is @xmath31 for all of the considered realistic equations of state . in such cases , dependence of astrophysical phenomena on the neutron star parameters @xmath32 can be very complex as demonstrated in @xcite for the case of the position of the innermost stable circular geodesic ( @xmath33 ) in the hartle - thorne spacetime .",
    "the difference of the @xmath33 in the hartle - thorne and kerr spacetimes having identical parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 reaches tens of percent and the dependence of @xmath33 on the spacetime parameters differs even qualitatively for any value of spin @xmath15 and for large values of the parameter @xmath12 giving @xmath34 .",
    "on the other hand , the relative differences are less than @xmath35 for spin @xmath15 and @xmath36  see figure 1 in @xcite .",
    "we can summarize that for the near - maximum mass neutron stars the situation is common and relatively simple for all equations of state if the spin parameter @xmath15 , since the quadrupole moment parameter satisfies the condition @xmath37 implying similarity of the hartle - thorne and kerr geometries and similar character of astrophysical phenomena in these spacetimes , with relative differences smaller than @xmath38 .",
    "the hartle - thorne metric is quadratic in the dimensionless spin @xmath2 , and for @xmath39 it introduces truncation errors of the order @xmath40 implying total errors introduced by assumption of the kerr background geometry about @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , more detailed and accurate analysis of the oscillatory motion , based on the hartle - thorne model or numerical codes of fast - rotating neutron stars ( rns @xcite or lorene @xcite codes ) will be necessary in future studies .",
    "for masses significantly smaller than the maximal mass related to a given equation of state , the hartle - thorne geometry depends strongly on the equation of state having the parameter @xmath41 ; in such a case it differs significantly ( qualitatively ) from the kerr geometry .",
    "approximation of a neutron star exterior by the kerr geometry is irrelevant in such situations .",
    "predictions of the string - loop oscillation model for the xte  j1701 - 407 source containing a neutron star have to be confronted with the theoretical constraints on mass and spin of neutron stars .",
    "the upper theoretical constraint on the  neutron star mass based on realistic equations of state of the subnuclear matter reads m < m_maxns = 2.5 _ [ limit - na - m - z - rotace ] @xcite .",
    "note that the limit governed by the causality condition gives @xmath42 @xcite , and the equation of state based on the relativistic mean - field theory @xcite allows for @xmath43 .",
    "the upper theoretical limit on the neutron star spin , based on the fully general relativistic set of numerical codes for numerical relativity , lorene @xcite , reads @xmath44 , as demonstrated in @xcite , and corresponds to the maximal rotational frequency of the neutron stars , @xmath45 . for @xmath46 corresponding to the observed neutron stars with fastest rotation ,",
    "the lorene codes predict the neutron star spin @xmath47  see figure 3 in @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the numerically obtained fully general relativistic , fast rotating , `` lorene '' external geometry , and the hartle - thorne external geometry obtained in the `` slow rotation '' approximation of the neutron star models , differ for the equations of state considered in @xcite maximally on the level of @xmath48 , if the near - maximal mass neutron stars with the dimensionless spin @xmath15 are considered .",
    "their difference is substantially higher , @xmath49 , for the spin @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , we put the theoretical limit on applicability of the hartle - thorne model of neutron stars to be a < 0.4 .",
    "[ limit - na - spin - z - rotace ]    for quark ( strange ) stars , the  maximal mass constraint is smaller because of softer equations of state assumed in modelling the  strange stars , but masses around @xmath51 are allowed @xcite ; in some special conditions the maximum mass can be substantially higher , namely @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , slightly superspinning states of strange quark stars with @xmath53 , exceeding the  black hole limit @xmath54 , are allowed as reported in @xcite .",
