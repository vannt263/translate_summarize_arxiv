    "we thus present our _ mea culpa _ and produce in fig .",
    "[ pdfs - correct ] the correct figure where all scales are consistently set to @xmath97 .",
    "the difference between the mstw and herapdf predictions reduces now to @xmath57 at most , which is indeed much more reasonable . in this case ,",
    "the smallest value of the cross section is given when using the abkm set and amounts to @xmath5730% in the considered higgs mass range as noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( this difference is slightly larger if the new abm10 pdf set is used @xcite ) .",
    "note that the same analysis presented for the lhc in ref .",
    "@xcite is not affected by this problem .",
    "+      this error does not affect the subsequent discussion and almost does not change our conclusions .",
    "indeed , the main analysis which led to fig .  2 ( which , we believe , is the most important result of our paper ) is still valid as we estimate the pdf uncertainties within the mstw set and our conclusion , that the theoretical uncertainty on the @xmath9 cross section at the tevatron is @xmath56 , still holds true .",
    "+    nevertheless , the interpretation of the cdf / d0 limit when lowering the normalisation of the cross section , has to be modified . instead of lowering the normalisation by 40% ,",

    "<S> first , the perturbative qcd corrections to the cross section turned out to be extremely large : the @xmath18factor defined as the ratio of the higher order to the leading order ( lo ) @xcite cross sections , is about a factor of two at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xcite and about a factor of three at the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that it is this exceptionally large @xmath18factor which allows a sensitivity to the higgs boson at the tevatron with the presently collected data . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the @xmath18factor is so large that one may question the reliability of the perturbative series . as a corollary </S>",
    "<S> , the possibility of still large higher order contributions beyond nnlo can not be excluded .   </S>",
    "<S> +    it has become customary to estimate the effects of these yet uncalculated higher order contributions from the variation of the cross section with the ( renormalisation @xmath19 and factorisation @xmath20 ) scale at which the process is evaluated . </S>",
    "<S> starting from a median scale @xmath21 which is taken to be @xmath22 in the @xmath23 process , the current convention is to vary these two scales within the range @xmath24 with the constant factor chosen to be @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the qcd corrections are so large in the present case , it is wise to extend the domain of scale variation and adopt instead a value @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the choice made in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite which resulted in an @xmath27 scale uncertainty on @xmath28 .   </S>",
    "<S> +    another problem that is specific to the @xmath17 process is that , already at lo , it occurs at the one  loop level with the additional complication of having to account for the finite mass of the loop particle . </S>",
    "<S> this renders the nlo calculation extremely complicated and the nnlo calculation a formidable task . </S>",
    "<S> luckily , one can work in an effective field theory ( eft ) approach in which the heavy loop particles are integrated out , making the calculation of the contributions beyond nlo possible . while this approach is justified for the dominant top quark contribution for @xmath29 $ \\sim$}}~}\\ ! </S>",
    "<S> 2m_t$ ] , it is not valid for the @xmath30-quark loop and for those involving the electroweak gauge bosons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainties induced by the use of the eft approach at nnlo are estimated to be of @xmath31 @xcite .   </S>",
    "<S> +    a third problem is due to the presently not satisfactory determination of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in this process which is initiated by @xmath32 fusion , the gluon densities are poorly constrained , in particular in the high bjorken@xmath33 regime which is relevant for higgs production at the tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , since the @xmath34 cross section is proportional to @xmath35 at lo and receives large contributions at @xmath36 , a small change of @xmath37 leads to a large variation of @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> related to that is the significant difference between the world average @xmath37 value and the one from deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) data used in the pdfs @xcite .   </S>",
    "<S> +    modern pdf sets provide a method to estimate these uncertainties by allowing a 1@xmath39 ( or more ) excursion of the experimental data that are used to perform the global fits . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the mstw collaboration @xcite provides a scheme that allows for a combined evaluation of the pdf uncertainties and the ( experimental and theoretical ) ones on @xmath37 . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the combined 90% cl pdf+@xmath40 uncertainty on @xmath41 at the tevatron , was found to be of order 15% . </S>",
    "<S> however , this ( hessian ) method does not account for the theoretical assumptions that enter into the parametrization of the pdfs . a way to access this theoretical uncertainty </S>",
    "<S> is to compare the results for the central values of the cross section with the best  </S>",
    "<S> fit pdfs when using different parameterizations .   </S>",
    "<S> +    [ pdfs ]    in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  1 , displayed are the values of @xmath42 obtained when using the gluon densities that are predicted by the four pdf sets that have parameterizations at nnlo : mstw @xcite , jr @xcite , abkm @xcite and herapdf @xcite . in the later case , </S>",
    "<S> two sets are provided : one with an @xmath37 value that is close to that of mstw and another one with the @xmath37 that is obtained using dis data alone . as can be seen , there is a very large spread in the four predictions , in particular at large @xmath43 values where the poorly constrained gluon densities at high@xmath33 are involved . </S>",
    "<S> the largest rate is obtained with mstw , but the cross section using the herapdf set data . </S>",
    "<S> since this is a prediction beyond leading order , it has also the contributions of the gluon included . </S>",
    "<S> this gives an indirect test that the gluon densities are predicted in a satisfactory way . </S>",
    "<S> see also ref.@xcite . ] with the small @xmath37 value is @xmath44 lower for @xmath45 gev . </S>",
    "<S> +    a related issue , which is of utmost importance , is the way these various uncertainties should be combined . the cdf and d0 experiments simply add in quadrature the uncertainties from the scale variation and the pdf uncertainties obtained through the hessian method ( and ignore the smaller eft uncertainty ) and they obtain an overall uncertainty of order 20% on the inclusive cross section . </S>",
    "<S> we believe ( see also ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) that this procedure has no justification . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the uncertainties associated to the pdfs in a given scheme should be viewed as purely theoretical uncertainties ( due to the theoretical assumptions in the parameterization ) despite of the fact that they are presented as the @xmath46 or more departure from the central values of the data included in the pdf fits . in some sense </S>",
    "<S> , they should be equivalent to the spread that one observes when comparing different parameterizations of the pdfs . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the pdf uncertainties should be considered as having no statistical ground ( or a flat prior in statistical language ) , and thus , combined linearly with the uncertainties from the scale variation and the eft approach , which are pure theoretical errors . </S>",
    "<S> this is the procedure recommended , for instance , by the lhc higgs cross section working group @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another , almost equivalent , procedure has been proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : one applies the combined pdf@xmath37 uncertainties directly on the maximal / minimal cross sections with respect to scale variation , and then adds linearly the small uncertainty from the eft approach . </S>",
    "<S> this last procedure , that we have used here , provides an overall uncertainty that is similar ( but slightly smaller ) to that obtained with the linear sum of all uncertainties .   +    the overall theoretical uncertainty on @xmath38 that is obtained this way , using mstw pdfs , is shown in fig .  2 . in the mass range @xmath47 gev with almost the best sensitivity , one obtains a @xmath48 total uncertainty , to be compared to the @xmath49 and @xmath50 uncertainties assumed , respectively , by the cdf and d0 collaborations . </S>",
    "<S> we also show for comparison , the result obtained when one adds linearly , i.e. as recommended by the lhc higgs cross section working group , the uncertainties from scale ( @xmath51 on the sum of the jet cross sections from jet acceptance is introduced when considering the higgs+jet cross sections </S>",
    "<S> . we will consider it to be experimental and , when added in quadrature to others , will have little impact . ] and pdfs ( @xmath52 when the mstw 68%cl pdf+@xmath53 error is multiplied by a factor of two following the pdf4lhc recommendation ) , leading to a total of @xmath54 for @xmath55 gev . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the uncertainty that we assume is comparable to the one obtained using the lhc procedure @xcite , the difference being simply due to the additional @xmath31 uncertainty from the use of the eft approach that we also include .   </S>",
    "<S> +    let us stress again that the comparison between our values and those assumed by the experimental collaborations becomes even worse when the cross section is evaluated with another set of pdfs . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , with the hera pdf parametrization , there is a reduction of @xmath56 of the normalisation compared to the central value adopted in the cdf / d0 combined analysis .   </S>",
    "<S> +    thus if the @xmath57 total uncertainty assumed by the cdf collaboration is adopted , one can consider two scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is a reduction of @xmath38 by @xmath57 to account for the difference between the quadratic and ( almost ) linear ways of combining the individual uncertainties . a second scenario , </S>",
    "<S> would be simply to adopt the normalisation obtained using the hera pdfs which gives a @xmath56 reduction of @xmath38 . in both cases , the remaining @xmath57 uncertainty due to scale variation and </S>",
    "<S> the eft will correspond to the overall theoretical uncertainty that has been assumed in the tevatron analysis .   </S>",
    "<S> +    so far , we have only addressed the issue of the signal rate . however , it is clear that one should equally consider the same uncertainties in the background cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> the by far largest background is @xmath58 for which cdf / d0 assume the inclusive cross section to be @xmath59 pb . </S>",
    "<S> we have reevaluated the rate using mcfm @xcite and find @xmath60 pb using the mstw scheme ( the errors due to @xmath37 are negligible here ) which gives @xmath61 pb if the errors are added according to ref .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , if we adopt the abkm or herapdf sets , we would obtain a rate of , respectively , 12.35 pb and 11.81 pb . i.e @xmath62 higher in the maximal case . </S>",
    "<S> we will thus consider that @xmath63 can be @xmath64 larger / lower than assumed by cdf / d0 under the same assumptions as @xcite but with @xmath65gev and find @xmath66 pb , which leads using the procedure of @xcite to a total uncertainty of @xmath67 , i.e much larger than the one assumed by cdf and d0 . in the case of the drell  yan process </S>",
    "<S> , there is also a @xmath64 excess in the rate if one uses herapdf instead of the mstw set : @xmath68 nb versus @xmath69 nb @xcite . ] </S>",
    "<S> and we will consider a third scenario in which the normalization of the @xmath70 background is changed by @xmath71 .   </S>",
    "<S> +    let us now come to the discussion of the higgs tevatron exclusion limit in the light of these theoretical uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> we will base our exploration on the cdf study published in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite which provides us with all the necessary details . in the analysis of the @xmath72 signal </S>",
    "<S> , the production cross section has been broken into the three pieces which yield different final state signal topologies , namely @xmath73 + 0jet , @xmath74 + 1jet and @xmath75 + 2jets or more . </S>",
    "<S> these channels which represent , respectively , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath64 of the total @xmath41 @xcite , have been studied separately . in the @xmath75 + 0jet and + 1jet samples , two configurations have been analyzed , one with a high and one with a low signal over background ratio ( depending on the quality of the lepton identification ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a sample with a low invariant mass for the two leptons , @xmath78 gev , has been included . </S>",
    "<S> five additional channels resulting from the contributions of the higgs  </S>",
    "<S> strahlung processes are also included : @xmath79 leading to same sign dilepton and to trilepton final states . </S>",
    "<S> these channels give rather small signal rates , though . </S>",
    "<S> +    our main goal is to estimate the necessary relative variation of the integrated luminosity needed to reproduce the currently quoted sensitivity of the cdf collaboration , if the normalization of the higgs signal cross section ( as well as the corresponding backgrounds ) is different from the one assumed to obtain the results .   </S>",
    "<S> +    our approach consists of the following . </S>",
    "<S> first , we try to reproduce as closely as possible the cdf results using the information given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a mass @xmath80 gev , for which the sensitivity is almost the best ( we will assume that the results are similar in the entire excluded mass range @xmath81175 gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , we consider the two scenarios discussed previously which , in practice , _ reduce the normalisation _ of the higgs production cross section by @xmath57 ( when all the uncertainties are added using the procedure of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) and @xmath56 ( when the herapdf set is used to derive the central value of the cross section ) . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the _ relative variation _ of the sensitivity and increase the integrated luminosity until we recover our initial sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we assume that the obtained relative variations of the sensitivity as well as the required luminosity to reproduce the initial sensitivity , would be the same for the cdf experiment .   </S>",
    "<S> +    a naive attempt to reproduce the cdf results @xcite was to use the background , signal and data numbers for all the search channels of tables i  viii without including the neural - network information or any treatment that uses shape information . </S>",
    "<S> this naive approach resulted in a sensitivity ( 95% cl/@xmath82 ) @xmath83 times weaker than the cdf one . </S>",
    "<S> this large difference made us feel uncomfortable , as we would have needed to make the above assumptions over one order of magnitude difference for the sensitivity ( or two orders of magnitude for the resulting necessary luminosity ) compared to the cdf analysis gain in sensitivity obtained using neural network techniques ( including spin  </S>",
    "<S> correlations , the main discriminant ) , is to be compared with the modest gain of @xmath8450% envisaged by the lhc experiments . </S>",
    "<S> it turned , though , that the cdf cut  based analysis was not fully optimised . ] .   </S>",
    "<S> +    to be as close as possible to the cdf analysis and results @xcite , we considered their neural network outputs for the 10 search channels ( each one for the signals , backgrounds and data ) presented in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 2,4,@xmath85,16 to build the background only and the background plus signal hypotheses , implemented them in the program mclimit @xcite and used a ratio of log  likelihood   la lep \" as a test  </S>",
    "<S> statistic for which we combined the above channels ; this provided the 95%cl/@xmath82 sensitivity limit on the higgs boson at the considered mass of @xmath80 gev . a median expected </S>",
    "<S> 95%cl/@xmath82 limit of @xmath86 has been obtained , to be compared to @xmath87 in the cdf analysis ; for the observed 95%cl/@xmath82 limit , the agreement is better as we obtain 1.35 compared to 1.32 . </S>",
    "<S> we feel thus satisfied with this rather close result as even the cdf and d0 collaborations agree in their methods within only 10% accuracy for the same input monte carlo and data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore believe that we can safely adopt the three working hypotheses described above . </S>",
    "<S> +    [ lumi ]    we consider the first two scenarios in which the @xmath88 signal cross section has been reduced by 20% and 40% . in each case , the expected signals and the corresponding backgrounds at the tevatron have been multiplied by a luminosity factor that has been varied . for each value of the luminosity factor , the corresponding median expected </S>",
    "<S> 95%cl/@xmath82 has been estimated and normalized to the initial sensitivity @xmath89 obtained above . </S>",
    "<S> the results are reported in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ lumi ] where the tevatron luminosity is shown as a function of the obtained normalised sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity needed to recover the current @xmath90 cdf sensitivity is given by the intersection of the vertical ( blue ) line with the luminosity curves . </S>",
    "<S> one sees that if @xmath41 is lowered by @xmath91 , a luminosity of @xmath92 fb@xmath93 , compared to 5.9 fb@xmath93 used in @xcite would be required for the same analysis to obtain the current sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> if the rate is lower by 40% , the required luminosity should increase to @xmath94 fb@xmath93 , i.e. more than a factor of two , to obtain the present cdf sensitivity .   </S>",
    "<S> +    as an additional exercise , we also analyzed the impact of changing the normalization of the background cross sections by @xmath95 , as in our third scenario , simultaneously with lowering the signal by 20 and 40% . </S>",
    "<S> one sees that increasing / decreasing the background will degrade / improve the sensitivity and a @xmath64 higher / lower luminosity would be required to recover the sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> +    we conclude by noting that the reduction of the signal by 40% as would be the case if the herapdfs were used for its normalization , would reopen the entire mass range @xmath0175 gev excluded by the cdf / d0 analysis with 12.6 fb@xmath93 combined data . </S>",
