    "our purpose here is to discuss aspects of the relationship of the solution of the one - dimensional second order wave equation to two discrete models thereof .",
    "the first discrete model is the digital waveguide model in one spatial dimension .",
    "the second discrete model is a finite difference model in the time domain . in particular we will also discuss how this relationship explains different behavior between the discrete models .",
    "this relationship has drawn much attention recently@xcite it is shown that the finite difference model can account for solutions of the wave equation and that these solutions are physically meaningful .",
    "this allows for a direct interpretation of recent results by karjalainen and erkut @xcite from the fundamental solution of the wave equation .",
    "karjalainen and erkut gave the restricting conditions necessary to make finite difference models in the time domain and digital waveguide models connect .",
    "regarding the stability behavior of the discrete models , the continuous stability is discussed and it is shown that physically stable responses of the string may appear unstable in a discrete model or signal - processing sense .    the paper is structured as follows .",
    "first known derivations of the solution of the wave equation is given , both classically and via the theory of fundamental solutions of its partial differential operators .",
    "a discrete comparison of the finite difference @xcite and the digital waveguide model follows .",
    "text@xcite provides the authoritative summary in of digital waveguides with respect to the continuous derivations given earlier .",
    "we conclude with implications of these observations .",
    "the results in this section are well - known .",
    "they are repeated here to facilitate arguments in the following sections . of concern",
    "is the general digital simulation of a string under force .",
    "the free ideal string is well - described by the the @xmath0 dimensional dalembertian operator on a scalar field . ] :    @xmath1    an external force leads to the inhomogeneous case of the same equation :    @xmath2    without loss of generality we assume that @xmath3 for our discussion and hence one gets the factored form of the dalembertian :    @xmath4    the factored form suggests the substitution @xmath5 and @xmath6 we obtain the canonical form of the wave equation :    @xmath7    this can be directly integrated , yielding @xcite @xmath8    where @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are `` constants of integration '' . however",
    ", this notation hides that either one of these constants has been integrated over with regards to its parameter .",
    "also these are not uniquely defined functions from a yet undefined functional space but rather any function from suitable family of functions @xcite .",
    "the derivation procedure suggests that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are one and twice differentiable everywhere in the solution space , but which one is twice differentiable depends in what order the solution has been integrated over .",
    "the solution of the homogeneous case ( [ eq : homo ] ) with initial conditions @xmath13 and @xmath14 is well known @xcite to correspond to dalembert s solution :    @xmath15    hence initial displacements travel left and right .",
    "initial velocity , however smears over a widening domain of influence .",
    "alternatively this results can be derived using the theory of partial differential operators .",
    "writing @xmath16 and @xmath17 one arrives at the generic partial differential operator equation :    @xmath18    here it is important to note that it is no longer required that @xmath19 is in the class of twice differentiable functions @xmath20 , but rather that @xmath19 and @xmath21 are distributions , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are arbitrary functions of one variable . naturally , this presupposes that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are @xmath24 , so as to be able to differentiate them .",
    "what should one think of a function @xmath25 which would be analogous except that @xmath22 and @xmath23 would be merely @xmath26 ( continuous ) , or not even continuous ?",
    "is it a wave or not ?",
    "i was obsessed by this question for some time , then i stopped thinking about it and relegated the question to a corner of my mind for future reflection . '' ] or generalized functions .",
    "what this means in detail we will have to defer to expositions available elsewhere @xcite . for our purpose it is interest to note that in the theory of distributions jumps and discontinuity are gracefully and meaningfully included in the formalism including the definition derivatives of entities like the dirac - delta @xmath27 over the space of suitable functions testing for this property . in addition",
    "it makes continuous convolutions a central operation to the calculation of continuous solution , which make it s treatment very similar to the study of discrete models @xcite which is regularly used for digital waveguide models@xcite . in our treatment here",
    "we will closely follow hulshofs@xcite and joshi and wassermann s lecture notes@xcite and also edwards text@xcite which are more accessible than , for example the technical survey by egorov , komech and shubin@xcite .",
    "the interested reader is pointed to the latter for statements of necessary theorems as well as proofs or detailed references to original proofs .",
    "the _ fundamental solution _ of the equation ( [ eq : opnot ] ) the effect of the operator @xmath28 on the distribution @xmath25 when it sees as input a dirac - delta ( as noted earlier this is not a function , but a distribution ) . in the digital signal processing literature@xcite @xmath25",
    "is called the impulse response of @xmath28 . in a dynamical sense",
    "it is the response to the inhomogeneous equation where the external force distribution is a dirac - delta @xmath29 .",
    "of immediate interest are solution forward in time the discussion is restricted to fundamental solutions in the positive half - plane with respect to time .",
    "this will be indicated by the superscript @xmath30 to the symbol @xmath31 for the fundamental solution :    @xmath32    it can be proved that the solution of both the homogeneous equation with initial value data and the inhomogeneous equation with some external force distribution can be recovered from the fundamental solution @xcite .",
    "this is done , in analogy to the impulse response convolution in digital signal processing @xcite by convolution of the fundamental solution with the force distribution and the initial value data @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in the literature",
    "these are call cauchy data .",
    "the fundamental solution@xcite of the one - dimensional wave equation can be derived to be :    @xmath35\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath36 is the heaviside distribution , which is the distributional integral of the dirac - delta distribution @xmath27 . in conventional functional form",
    "the heaviside step-``function '' can be written as@xcite :    @xmath37    the interpretation of this equation is indeed important because it indicates , that the `` system response '' of a wave operator to an input impulse are not isolated traveling wave pulses but traveling step - distributions .",
    "it may be convenient to think of the fundamental solution as the `` distributional continuous impulse response '' .",
    "this makes sense because the solution of equation can be recovered by convolution of the fundamental solution with the cauchy data .",
    "the continuous convolution has the familiar form @xcite : @xmath38    where @xmath39 is cauchy data in one variable .",
    "if both data and the fundamental solution are in two dimensions ( as is possibly the case for external force distributions ) , one need to convolve over both variables .",
    "specifically it can be shown ( see @xcite ) that for the set of cauchy data @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 one gets the complete solution :    @xmath43    with the convolutions :    @xmath44    performing the convolutions yields the the solution which is equivalent to the conventional inhomogeneous initial value solution of the wave equation @xcite : @xmath45    for proofs of uniqueness see egorov , komech and shubin@xcite . in the absence of external forces",
    "this reduces to the initial value solution ( [ eq : ivsolve ] ) .",
    "the theory of generalized functions for partial differential operators explains why equations ( [ eq : canonsolve ] ) , derived for the forced case , and ( [ eq : ivsolve ] ) , derived for the homogeneous initial value case have similar structure .",
    "the inhomogeneous case can in a generalized sense be made to include the homogeneous initial value problem ( also called cauchy problem ) .",
    "for example , if we symbolically write @xmath46 one sees that the external force response matches the response to the initial velocity .",
    "@xmath47    hence an external force distribution which is impulsive in time @xmath48 is indistinguishable from the equivalent initial velocity distribution @xmath49 .",
    "conversely it is noteworthy that initial values do not prescribe a state of the string alone , but also prescribe a sudden onset of such state .",
    "hence initial values are not necessarily a free - field solution of the wave equation , that is the state of a string in the absence of force .",
    "rather impulsive onset states act like external forces .",
    "in particular one can write the solution of the wave equation for the inhomogeneous initial value problem in the following simple form @xcite :    @xmath50    next we note the differentiation of distributions on step - functions ( see also the appendix [ sec : distprop ] ) :    @xmath51    observe , using this relationship , that the derivative of the fundamental solution ( [ eq : fundsol ] ) are two propagating dirac - deltas , here again in symbolic notation :    @xmath52    for the current discussion it remains only to point out that the first contribution of ( [ eq : fundcauchy ] ) look like propagating impulses under differentiation . from ( [ eq : fundcauchy ] ) we see that the solution of the wave equation will only stay on the characteristic lines @xmath53 and @xmath54 for a restricted class solutions of the wave equation . only for very exceptional cases of initial velocities @xmath23 and external forces @xmath55",
    "will the solution not integrate into the domain .",
    "rather generically one ought to expect them to integrate into the inside of the forward characteristic cone @xmath56 as depicted in figure [ fig : cone ] .",
    "the condition in which integration into the interior of the characteristic cone does not occur will be discussed in the discrete case and in this context has been discovered by karjalainen and erkut @xcite .",
    "for this to be appropriate , care needs to be taken when assuming the impulse response of the system to have a particular form , otherwise one ought to expect both contributions at the same time . additionally , in a physically realistic situation , when it can not be guaranteed that an excitation is of purely displacement - type , one ought to expect that the dynamics of the system to integrate and persist over the whole inside of the characteristic cone .",
    "it also is worthwhile to point out that this is the mathematically consistent solution of the wave equation @xcite .",
    "hence , assuming that the wave equation is a reasonable model for a given physical situation , one ought to expect such a behavior to exist and be observable .    as a note , we state , that it is in fact well known that the huygens principle , the isolated propagation of wave fronts , only holds for dalembertians of odd spatial dimensions greater or equal to @xmath57 @xcite meaning that only in this case does the fundamental solution concentrate on the characteristic cone @xmath58 .",
    "other cases , including one spatial dimension , have a wave influence inside the characteristic cone .",
    "the idea that the solution would concentrate on the characteristic cone for all dimensions was held for a long time by mathematicians working on the wave - equation until hadamard opened the development and the situation is since well understood @xcite .    regarding huygens principle ,",
    "a short popular exposition can be found in @xcite whereas a comprehensive technical exposition can be found in @xcite .",
    "next the leapfrog finite difference scheme @xcite will be compared with the digital waveguide method @xcite .",
    "the full treatment of derivations will not be repeated here and the reader is referred to these sources for details .",
    "now let us discuss the properties of the so - called leap - frog finite difference molecule for the wave equation .",
    "the explicit time - stepping equation reads @xcite :    @xmath59    where the relationship between the discrete time step @xmath60 and the spatial discretization @xmath61 is chosen to satisfy @xmath62 . in this case",
    "the leapfrog molecule can be shown to be consistent at sampling points with the wave equation @xcite .",
    "it can also be shown that waveguide solutions are solutions of the leapfrog @xcite .",
    "as karjalainen observes , the converse does not hold @xcite .    for future discussion we will use the following symbols :    @xmath63    the condition that an impulse at the root of the molecule will only create responses along the characteristics of the wave",
    "can be expressed by the condition @xmath64 , i.e. there is no data within the characteristic domain of the molecule .",
    "hence the non - integrating molecule condition reads :    @xmath65    from this we get the relationship of waves on the characteristics to their sum :    @xmath66    the updating rules for waveguides are :    @xmath67    with the external force rule :    @xmath68    the wave reconstruction rule is :    @xmath69    in response to an external force function @xmath70 .",
    "if we take an impulse of height @xmath71 at time @xmath72 we get :    @xmath73    the reconstructed wave using ( [ eq : reconwg ] ) is zero everywhere except at :    @xmath74    and we see that the non - integrating case of the leapfrog ( [ eq : nonint ] ) is satisfied with @xmath75 and @xmath76",
    ".    the leapfrog will `` integrate '' whenever condition ( [ eq : nonint ] ) is not satisfied . to study the behavior within the characteristic domain it is first assumed that the elements on the characteristic of the molecule @xmath77 and @xmath78 are unaltered . that is , the same waves as before travel outward in the molecule .",
    "this leaves us to study an altered relationship between @xmath79 and @xmath71 .",
    "let @xmath71 be the difference of @xmath80 , the molecule value for the non - integrating case ( [ eq : nonint ] ) , and @xmath81 , an assumed contribution to the interior of the characteristic domain .",
    "then we get :    @xmath82    subtracting ( [ eq : h1 ] ) from ( [ eq : h0 ] ) we get :    @xmath83    hence the response at at the interior point of the characteristic domain is constant with regards to the contribution of the incoming wave that violates the non - integration condition ( [ eq : nonint ] ) .    to study how this behavior",
    ", one can illustrate the response of the leapfrog to an initial @xmath84 :    @xmath85    and compare it to an excitation which observes ( [ eq : nonint ] ) . @xmath86 and @xmath87 :    @xmath88    observe that ( [ eq : proponly ] ) appears to be the sum of traveling histories and they are time - symmetric around the intersection point .",
    "a time - symmetric solution is an equal contribution to the solution traveling forward and backward in time and their sum yielding the complete solution .",
    "dalembert s solution ( [ eq : ivsolve ] ) can be used to investigate this observation when writing it in the form following alpert , greengard and hagstrom@xcite :    @xmath89    taking the time - symmetric sum we get :    @xmath90    similarly , by taking the difference , one finds the time - asymmetric case :    @xmath91    in the discrete case it is easy to see this property preserved in the leapfrog case :    @xmath92    @xmath93    while ( [ eq : proponly2 ] ) nicely illustrates the time - symmetry and the `` interference '' of waves at the interaction point , ( [ eq : intcone2 ] ) is insightful as it clearly shows the properties of a velocity excitation .",
    "the displacement vanishes at the interaction moment , while the temporal slope is maximal .",
    "it should be made clear , that vanishing of data at one time - step in the leap - frog simulation does not imply velocity solutions .",
    "this can be seen if a positive and a negative impulsive wave cross , creating a time - symmetric situation that will not integrate inside the domain :    @xmath94    we observe that this situation does satisfy the time - symmetric equation ( [ eq : timesym ] ) .",
    "alternatively similar results can be derived by discretizing the initial velocity @xmath49 directly using a matching center difference scheme @xcite :    @xmath95    and including an arbitrary background field one gets :    @xmath96    where we use the notation @xmath97 and @xmath98 to denote initial displacement wave contributions aligned with the left - right branch of the leapfrog - molecule .",
    "observe that ( [ eq : initvalkrey ] ) does satisfy the same integration ( [ eq : int ] ) and non - integration ( [ eq : nonint ] ) conditions .",
    "hence a velocity contribution @xmath23 can be interpreted as any violation of the rule of the sum of incoming traveling waves .",
    "this behavior has been observed earlier .",
    "karjalainen observed that an asymmetric pair of impulses need to be fed into a leapfrog motivated junction formulations to avoid integration behavior @xcite .",
    "the subsequent physical interpretation is derived in @xcite from a center - difference time - discrete velocity excitation .",
    "an interpretation of this result follows next .",
    "the non - integrating condition can be algorithmically enforced by a method discovered by karjalainen and erkut @xcite .",
    "hence we will call this the karjalainen - erkut condition .",
    "the rule is to present the excitation through a feed - forward filter @xcite :    @xmath99    which can be derived from physical conditions by using a center difference velocity term @xcite .",
    "we observe that the karjalainen - erkut condition ( [ eq : karer ] ) creates two impulses from one and those impulses are center symmetric and sign - inverted . if we calculate those two impulse responses separately and then create the sum , we see that the impulsive propagating solution comes about as the _ difference of two heaviside distributions_. the pulses are represented by their sign only as the amplitudes are assumed to be matched :    @xmath100    @xmath101    @xmath102    @xmath103    @xmath104    hence we see that in an impulse - response interpretation of the leap - frog , a heaviside integration over the characteristic cone of influence is sensible and the karjalainen - erkut condition ensures that each heaviside integration is matched with a delayed sign - inverted response that cancels all interior integration of the first impulse to leave unaltered the traveling impulse solution .",
    "next the effect of imposing spatial boundary conditions is studied . for this",
    "it is assumed that the solution of the wave equation is only meaningful and defined for a compact domain @xmath105 .",
    "the length of the domain is denoted by @xmath106 . for the boundary of the domain",
    "we write @xmath107 and the interior of the domain is defined by the quotient @xmath108 . on each distinct point of the boundary @xmath107",
    "we impose one boundary condition .",
    "fixed ends @xmath109 we call dirichlet boundary conditions , whereas open ends @xmath110 we call neumann boundary conditions .",
    "note that a circular domain @xmath111 is a periodic unbounded domain .",
    "the behavior at the boundary can be conveniently studied by extension of the domain .",
    "if the boundary is of dirichlet type , the value of @xmath25 needs to vanish at the boundary and hence the extension needs to be odd . in the case of neumann conditions",
    "@xmath25 needs to be even . as the resulting infinite extension is periodic in @xmath112",
    "this extension can be interpreted as a periodic unbounded domain of this length @xcite .",
    "we will denote the original domain by subscript @xmath113 and extended domains by indicies @xmath114 .",
    "the periodicity implies @xmath115 for all @xmath116 .",
    "the following discussion will be restricted to the behavior in response to the velocity term @xmath23 in ( [ eq : ivsolve ] ) .",
    "observe that with periodicity we can write the integral as the sum of contributions of the periodic domains :    @xmath117    hence we integrate over all contributions above the characteristic lines from an excitation point of the periodic domain .    with dirichlet conditions one gets the odd extension @xcite :    @xmath118    and for neumann conditions we get the even extension :    @xmath119    with @xmath120 and @xmath121 .    integrating up to the point where the characteristic lines have reached @xmath122 one gets for dirichlet boundary conditions :    @xmath123    hence integral contributions cancel every @xmath122 and the maximum amplitude is bounded by the integral of @xmath124 over the original domain @xmath125 .",
    "the same procedure for neumann boundary conditions leads to :    @xmath126    figure [ fig : sumvel ] shows the behavior for a string tied at the ends ( dirichlet conditions ) after an initial impulsive distribution .",
    "it reveals many properties of the effect of the boundary on the integration of velocities under dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "it shows the odd - periodic extension of the domain @xmath125 to @xmath127 , @xmath128 , it also shows the cancellation and constructive interference effect of overlapping integration regions .",
    "it also shows the @xmath122 cancellation of waves .",
    "erkut and karjalainen@xcite ( compare their figure 7 ) reported numerical simulations using the leapfrog molecule with comparable results , which hence matches the situation of the continuous model .",
    "observe that the neumann condition leads to a linear increase in the displacement as a response to velocity or force data being present .",
    "the difference between the dirichlet condition and the neumann condition can be interpreted as the difference between an alternating sum and an accumulative sum .    in the dirichlet case",
    "the sign of the area integrated over alternates with periodicity @xmath129 and hence any finite bounded signal @xmath124 will produce an alternating sum which is bounded similarly but infinitely periodic .    in the neumann the signs match and hence the area integrated over increases with every iteration over the domain by the integral over the finite bounded signal @xmath124 .",
    "once the support of @xmath124 has been exhausted , this obviously corresponds to a linear increase .",
    "this is however , not an unphysical situation .",
    "this corresponds to constant kinetic energy being present in the string and hence implies that the energy is bound .",
    "this can easily be understood as linear increasing displacement implies constant velocity , which in turn implies constant energy .",
    "hence energy is conserved@xcite .",
    "it can be interpreted as a string moving at constant velocity , which is meaningful as the neumann conditions imply that the string is not tied down at the boundaries .",
    "hence linear buildup in a displacement - like wave variable is energy - conserving .",
    "numerically this is still an undesirable situation because even in the absence of numerical imprecision , the dynamic range of numbers are bounded and hence an infinite increase can not be represented .",
    "the case of neumann boundary conditions is interesting because it highlights the difference between notions of stability as customary in discrete signal literature@xcite and stability in physical situations .",
    "the neumann displacement response to any bounded input will be unbounded and hence is evidently not bounded - input bounded - output ( bibo ) stable , see oppenheim and schafer@xcite , p. 20 .",
    "we suggest that this bibo - unstable but energy - conserving system be called _ physically stable_. the bibo - instability is a discrete computational problem and not one of the physical situation .",
    "this paper discussed the linear lossless wave equation and its relationship to discrete models , namely a finite difference scheme called leapfrog , and the digital waveguide method .",
    "it is shown that the waveguide model corresponds to the finite difference scheme in the absence of integration . in the continuous case",
    ", integration can be expected to occur when initial velocities or external forces are present . in this light",
    "the observed integrating behavior of finite difference discretization in the time domain using the leapfrog molecule displays results consistent with the continuous model .",
    "here we assume that the wave equation is at least in principle physically meaningful for the modeled situation . if this is the case one should expect consistent behavior of the related discrete models .",
    "in relation to this argument , a use of waveguide discretization that does not include contributions inside the characteristic cone , does not include the integrating behavior of the model equation .",
    "in general both integrating and non - integrating responses are to be expected and hence should be present unless they can be explicitly excluded for physical reasons .",
    "this also implies that the impulse response in just one variable in general will not carry the full dynamics of the string .",
    "hence any assumption of the non - integrating impulse response in one variable in the construction of physical models might contain deviations for it only covers a reduced set of the solution space .",
    "much thanks to sile omodhrain for her support and input .",
    "the author also has much gratitude to send to matti karjalainen and cumhur erkut for stimulating discussions relating to this topic .",
    "i am also grateful for their sending of reprints and the graceful sharing of novel unpublished manuscripts .",
    "this work was made possible by the kindness of employment of media lab europe and access to its academic resources .",
    "let @xmath22 be a distribution on a real open interval @xmath105 and let @xmath130 be in the the set of test functions @xmath131 then one has @xcite :    @xmath132    and for arbitrary derivatives :    @xmath133    the dirac delta @xmath29 has the property :    @xmath134    hence returns the value of @xmath130 at @xmath113 . by the differentiation",
    "rule the higher order derivatives of the dirac delta returns the higher order derivatives at @xmath113 with alternating sign :    @xmath135    let @xmath136 be the heaviside distribution .",
    "it is defined as @xcite :    @xmath137    it hence permits the positive part of @xmath130 over the domain .",
    "the derivative of the heaviside distribution @xmath136 yields ( using ( [ eq : distint ] ) and ( [ eq : distdiffdelta ] ) ) the dirac - delta :    @xmath138",

    "they are equivalent up to two `` constants of integration '' .",
    "note that differentiation eliminated @xmath148 and @xmath149 in one case and hence the homogeneous wave equation is again indistinguishable for both the homogeneous and a class of inhomogeneous systems of first order equations and in this sense they are equivalent only up to two functions .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> this paper discusses aspects of the second order hyperbolic partial differential equation associated with the ideal lossless string under tension and it s relationship to two discrete models . </S>",
    "<S> these models are finite differencing in the time domain and digital waveguide models . </S>",
    "<S> it is known from the theory of partial differential operators that in general one has to expect the string to accumulate displacement as response to impulsive excitations . </S>",
    "<S> discrete models should be expected to display comparable behavior . as a result </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that impulsive propagations can be interpreted as the difference of step functions and hence how the impulsive response can be seen as one case of the general integrating behavior of the string . </S>",
    "<S> impulsive propagations come about in situations of time - symmetry whereas step - function occur as a result of time - asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the physical stability of the wave equation , which allows for unbounded growth in displacement , and computational stability , that requires bounded growth , is derived . </S>"
