    "convincing observational evidences indicate that roughly 80% of the matter in our universe is dark matter ( dm ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the understanding of the dm nature is still at the budding stage .",
    "if the form of dm is any kind of elementary particle @xmath3 , theoretical predictions for its mass lie in a wide range , from sub - ev scale to grand unified scale .",
    "even though , more and more experimental searches , including direct and indirect detection with terrestrial or satellite instruments , are looking for the dm signals .",
    "the knowledge on dm is accumulating rapidly .",
    "if dm interacts with ordinary matters weakly , it may leave tracks in the detector and be caught directly .",
    "the possibility to see such signals depends on dm mass and its interaction cross section with the ordinary matter in the detector .",
    "the situation is similar for the indirect searches where one looks for the flux excess in cosmic rays , gamma rays , and neutrinos .",
    "the flux excess for the above particles are due to dm annihilation or dm decays .",
    "different search strategies would have sensitivities to different parameter ranges and all together cover quite a broad range for dm mass and dm interaction cross section , respectively .    in this paper , we study the general framework of dm capture , annihilation and evaporation in the sun .",
    "the capture of galactic dm by the sun through dm - nuclei collisions was first proposed and calculated in refs .  @xcite .",
    "it was then observed that the assumption of dm thermal distribution according to the average temperature of the sun is a good approximation for capture and annihilation processes , but the correction to the evaporation mass can reach to 8% in the true distribution calculation  @xcite .",
    "the abundance of dm inside the sun hence results from the balancing among dm capture , annihilation and evaporation processes .",
    "updated calculations on these processes are given in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in our study",
    ", we particularly note that for both collisionless cold dm and warm dm there exists a so - called core / cusp problem  @xcite which addresses the discrepancy between the computational structure simulation and the actual observation  @xcite .",
    "dm self - interaction has been introduced to resolve this inconsistency  @xcite .",
    "this type of analyses put constraints on the ratio of dm self - interaction cross section to the dm mass , @xmath4 , from observations of various galactic structures  @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite used the icecube data  @xcite to constrain the magnitude of @xmath2 for @xmath5 in the range of @xmath6  gev to @xmath7  tev ( also see the study of high energy neutrino flux from dm annihilation within the sun with the inclusion of dm self - interaction in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in their work",
    "the evaporation effect can be neglected for the considered dm mass region and the detectability of @xmath2 by the icecube through observing the final state neutrino flux produced by the dm annihilation is analyzed . in this paper we shall concentrate on the low mass region of @xmath7  gev dm mass since such a mass range has not been probed by the icecube data mentioned above . furthermore , this is also the mass range where the indirect search is crucial . in the case of spin - independent interaction ,",
    "the sensitivity of dm direct search quickly turns poor for @xmath5 less than @xmath8 gev @xcite . therefore the icecube - pingu  @xcite detector with a @xmath9 gev threshold energy could be more sensitive than some of the direct detection experiments for @xmath10 gev . for spin - dependent interaction ,",
    "the icecube - pingu sensitivity has been estimated to be much better than constraints set by direct detection experiments  @xcite .    for illustrative purpose",
    ", we shall only consider neutrino flux produced by dm annihilating into leptons such as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the final - state neutrinos can be detected by terrestrial neutrino telescopes such as icecube - pingu  @xcite .",
    "we do not consider @xmath13 because muons will suffer severe energy losses in the sun before they decay to neutrinos .",
    "the soft neutrino spectrum in this case is dominated by the atmospheric background .",
    "one also expects that the neutrino telescopes are less sensitive to heavy quark channels such as @xmath14 than their sensitivities to leptonic channels .",
    "this is caused by the relatively softer neutrino spectrum resulting from the @xmath15-hadron decays compared to the neutrino spectrum from @xmath16 decays  @xcite . for light quark channels @xmath17 , the hadronic cascades produce pions or kaons in large multiplicities .",
    "these hadrons decay almost at rest and produce mev neutrino fluxes , which from the observational point of view could be as promising as the hard spectrum channels  @xcite .",
    "however we would not discuss these signatures because the threshold energy of icecube - pingu is in the gev range .    for @xmath7  gev dm mass",
    ", it is necessary to consider evaporation processes for determining the dm abundance inside the sun .",
    "we shall demonstrate that dm evaporation can arise both from dm - nuclei scatterings and dm self - interactions .",
    "in fact the inclusion of dm self - interaction can raise the critical mass such that evaporation can take place for dm lighter than this mass scale . on the other hand , dm self - interaction also enhances total dm number trapped inside the sun for @xmath5 greater than the critical mass .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we calculate the dm number accumulated inside the sun via four processes .",
    "we then present the parameter space in which the equilibrium condition holds . in section iii , we present the numerical results of our analysis .",
    "the sensitivity of icecube - pingu to dm self - interaction inside the sun is presented in section iv .",
    "finally , we conclude in section v.",
    "we assume that both the galactic dm and the nuclei inside the sun follow the thermal distributions .",
    "if dm interacts with nuclei in the sun then it can be captured by the sun when its final velocity is smaller than the escape velocity from the sun .",
    "alternatively , dm trapped inside the sun will be kicked out if its final velocity after the scattering with the nuclei is larger than the escape velocity .",
    "the inclusion of dm self - interaction will also have effects on the capture and evaporation of dm inside the sun .",
    "we will come to details of this in the later discussion .",
    "the captured dm could have reached to an equilibrium state if the equilibrium time scale is less than the age of the sun ( @xmath18 ) .",

    "for spin - dependent ( sd ) interactions , the capture rate is given by  @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the local dm density , @xmath29 is the velocity dispersion , @xmath30 is the sd dm - hydrogen scattering cross section and @xmath5 is the dm mass .",
    "the capture rate from spin - independent ( si ) scattering is given by  @xcite @xmath31 here @xmath32 and @xmath33 are si dm - hydrogen and -helium cross sections respectively . taking the approximation @xmath34 , the dm - nucleus cross section @xmath35 is related to dm - nucleon cross section @xmath36 by @xmath37 for sd interactions and @xmath38 for si interactions , where @xmath39 is the atomic number , @xmath40 the mass of the nucleus , @xmath41 the total angular momentum of the nucleus and @xmath42 and @xmath43 the spin expectation values of proton and of neutron averaged over the entire nucleus  @xcite .",
    "the dm evaporation rate in the sun , @xmath44 , has been well investigated in refs .",
    "the evaporation rate is usually ignored in the dm evolution equation since it happens for a very low dm mass , @xmath45 . a updated calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite has shown that , for @xmath46 , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the escape velocity from the core of the sun , @xmath49 is the dm temperature in the sun , and @xmath50 is average dm orbit radius which is the mean dm distance from the solar center .",
    "the quantity @xmath51 is the sum of the scattering cross sections of all the nuclei within a radius @xmath52 , where the solar temperature has dropped to @xmath53 of the dm temperature .",
    "although the approximate form of @xmath44 can be obtained as the above equation , we shall adopt the exact form of @xmath23 given in ref .",
    "@xcite for our subsequent numerical calculations .    as stated before",
    ", @xmath54 is the dm capture rate by scattering off the dm that have been captured inside the sun .",
    "this kind of scattering may result in the target dark matter particles being ejected from the sun upon recoil .",
    "however , because the escape speed from the sun is sufficiently large , the effect of target dm ejection by recoil is only a small correction to the simple solar capture estimate .",
    "hence the self - capture rate in the sun can be approximated by  @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56  @xcite is a dimensionless average solar potential experienced by the captured dm within the sun , @xmath57 is the local number density of halo dm , @xmath2 is the elastic scattering cross section of dm with themselves , @xmath58 is the sun s escape velocity at the surface , and @xmath59 is the square of a dimensionless velocity of the sun through the galactic halo with @xmath60 sun s velocity and @xmath61 the local velocity dispersion of dm in the halo .",

    "since the dm can interact among themselves , dm trapped in the solar core could scatter with other trapped dm and results in the evaporation .",
    "essentially , one of the dm particles could have velocity greater than the escape velocity after the scattering .",
    "this process involves two dm particles just like annihilation .",
    "we note that both processes lead to the dm dissipation in the sun . on the other hand @xmath25 does not produce neutrino flux as @xmath65 does . since the derivation of @xmath25 has not been given in the previous literature , we present some details of the derivation in appendix [ sec : appendix ]  @xcite .    with @xmath66 as the initial condition , the general solution to eq .",

    "the derivation of dm self - interaction induced evaporation is similar to the usual nucleon induced evaporation  @xcite .",
    "one simply makes the parameter replacements @xmath158 where @xmath49 is the dm temperature inside the earth .",
    "the dm velocity distribution is approximated by maxwell - boltzmann distribution given by @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the dm velocity .",
    "the calculation of dm - dm scattering rate proceeds by choosing one of the dm as the incident particle and the other dm as one of the targets which satisfy maxwell - boltzmann distribution in their velocities .",
    "we then sum over the incident states with maxwell - boltzmann distribution as well .",
    "let the velocity of the incident dm be @xmath160 and the velocity of the faster dm in the final state as @xmath161 , respectively .",
    "since we are considering the dm evaporation due to their self interactions , we have @xmath162 .",
    "it is essential to take note on the symmetry factor for identical particle scattering ( @xmath163 scattering ) as compared to the dm - nucleus scattering studied before .",
    "we note that the faster dm with velocity @xmath161 can be either one of the dm particles in the final state .",
    "this generates an extra factor of @xmath164 relative to dm - nucleus scattering . on the other hand , due to identical particles in the initial state",
    ", a factor @xmath165 must be applied as we sum over initial states according to thermal distributions .",
    "hence the dm - dm differential scattering rate with the velocity transition @xmath166 can be inferred from dm - nucleus scattering with suitable parameter replacements , which is given by @xmath167 where we have summed up the target dm according to the thermal distribution @xmath168 described above , @xmath169 and @xmath170.\\ ] ] therefore the dm - dm scattering rate with @xmath161 greater than the escape velocity @xmath171 is given by the integral @xmath172 carrying out the integral yields @xmath173\\chi(\\beta_{-},\\beta_{+}).\\ ] ] to calculate the evaporation rate per unit volume at the position @xmath174 , we should sum up all possible states of the incident dm as follows : @xmath175    the dm number density inside the sun is determined by @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the density at the solar core , and @xmath178 is the solar gravitational potential with respect to the core so that @xmath179 with @xmath180 the newton gravitational constant , @xmath181 the solar mass enclosed within radius @xmath182 , and @xmath183 the solar density .",
