    "the theory of conventional , low - temperature superconductors has been well understood for decades , within bcs theory  @xcite , and many material properties of superconductors have been accurately described within the more appropriate migdal - eliashberg formalism  @xcite , which includes the retardation effects of the electron - phonon interaction in a realistic manner .",
    "the success of the formalism arises from migdal s theorem  @xcite , which says that vertex corrections can be neglected when the ratio of the phonon energy scale to the electron energy scale is small ( such as the value of @xmath3 typical of conventional low - temperature superconductors ) .",
    "the physical reason being that the ion movement is typically too slow to respond to anything but the mean - field potential produced by the fast - moving electrons .    in recent years",
    "there has been investigation of superconducting materials  @xcite such as ba@xmath4k@xmath5bio@xmath6 , k@xmath6c@xmath7 and the a@xmath8s , whose phonon energy scale is a larger fraction of their electron energy scale . for such materials ,",
    "the standard migdal - eliashberg theory may no longer be valid , either because second - order processes in the electron - phonon coupling ( so - called vertex corrections ) can not be neglected  @xcite , or because structure in the electronic density of states and finite - bandwidth effects become significant  @xcite .",
    "our aim is to identify those experiments which can clearly indicate where vertex corrections , or structure in the electronic density of states , are observable in real materials . in particular , we wish to uncover those effects which can not be mimicked by a coulomb pseudopotential , @xmath0 , as this would render them unobservable in practice , because a @xmath0 is typically fitted to the experimental data .    the most compelling evidence for the effect of vertex corrections would come from a tunneling conductance measurement that provided data for the tunneling conductance out to an energy at least twice that of the maximal phonon frequency of the bulk material .",
    "then a tunneling inversion could be performed using only the experimental data out to an energy of the maximal bulk phonon energy , and the results for migdal - eliashberg theory would be compared to the vertex - corrected theory for the experimental data that was measured in the multiphonon region , at voltages above the maximal bulk phonon energy of the material .",
    "unfortunately , such an analysis has only been performed for lead@xcite and in that case , the experimental data was not accurate enough in the multiphonon region to be able to see if effects of vertex corrections were observable .",
    "similarly , high energy data from optical conductivity experiments would indicate whether or not vertex corrections are important , but there again , the accuracy of the data might preclude seeing effects of vertex corrections .    in order to determine what effects are unmistakenly due to vertex corrections",
    ", we fit a coulomb pseudopotential @xmath9 to a migdal - eliashberg theory so that the superconducting transition temperature @xmath10 is the same for the vertex - corrected theory ( with no @xmath9 ) and the conventional migdal - eliashberg theory ( with a @xmath9 but no vertex corrections ) . in the case of dressed phonons , we adjust both the electron - phonon interaction energy and @xmath9 , in order to fit the same values of @xmath2 , and @xmath1 as the results with vertex corrections .",
    "this procedure is exactly the procedure carried out in analyzing experimental data within the conventional theory .",
    "we carry out this `` experimental analysis '' on a model system where we know that vertex corrections have a large effect , in order to see the extent to which the conventional analysis masks their observation .",
    "hence we look for differences in thermodynamic quantities between these results and those with vertex corrections .",
    "any quantities which are significantly different when calculated with a fitted @xmath9 instead of vertex corrections pin - point the experiments that can give the best indication that a material needs to have vertex corrections included in its description .",
    "since this is the initial attempt at solving such a problem , we study a simple model system , which has a non - constant electronic density of states ( figure  [ fig : dos3d ] ) , using both migdal - eliashberg formalism , and going beyond it , to include vertex corrections . the vertex corrections are second - order diagrams where a pair of phonon lines cross , as shown in the self - energies of figure  [ fig : self](b ) . in both cases ,",
    "the phonon propagators can be dressed ( _ i.e. _ with a phonon self - energy included ) or bare , as shown in figure  [ fig : self ] .",
    "we find that dressing the phonons leads to a strong enhancement of the effective interaction strength , exemplified by a large renormalization in the value of the electron - phonon coupling parameter , @xmath2 .",
    "the specific model we study is the holstein hamiltonian  @xcite on a 3d cubic lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian consists of conduction electrons that hop from site to site , coupled to harmonic , localized ( einstein ) phonons : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are fermionic operators which create and destroy , respectively , an electron of spin-@xmath14 in a single wannier ( tight - binding ) state on the lattice site _ i _ , whose total electron occupancy is given by @xmath15 .",
    "the electron hopping is between nearest neighbors only , such that @xmath16 if @xmath17 are neighboring sites , with @xmath18 the overlap integral , and @xmath19 otherwise .",
    "the phonons , of mass , @xmath20 , with displacement @xmath21 and momentum , @xmath22 , are characterized by their frequency , @xmath23 .",
    "the strength of the bare electron - phonon coupling can be measured by the bipolaron binding energy , @xmath24 , where : @xmath25 the chemical potential is @xmath26 , and is always calculated self - consistently for a given average number of electrons per site , @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "particle - hole symmetry occurs at half - filling , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we concentrate our work on superconductivity and ignore any possible charge - density wave order that may occur near half - filling .",
    "we carry out weak - coupling expansions within the conserving approximations of baym and kadanoff  @xcite .",
    "the electron self - energy , @xmath31 , is given as a functional derivative of the free - energy functional , @xmath32 , with respect to the electron green s function , @xmath33 .",
    "when dressing the phonons , we maintain a conserving approximation by careful choice of the phonon self - energy .",
    "in this case , there must be a free - energy functional whose _ partial _ derivative with respect to the electron green s function yields the electron self - energy , _ and _ whose _ partial _ derivative with respect to the phonon green s function , @xmath34 , yields the phonon self - energy .",
    "in such cases there always exists a related free - energy functional whose _ full _ functional derivative with respect to the electron green s function yields the electron self - energy . in all cases ,",
    "the irreducible vertex function is given by the _ full _ functional derivative of the electron self - energy with respect to the electron green s function , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath35 .",
    "we employ the local approximation in our calculations , which means we neglect the momentum dependence in the self - energy and irreducible vertex functions .",
    "the local problem gives an exact solution in the infinite - dimensional limit  @xcite , but in this case it is an approximation , which , as used in migdal - eliashberg theory , is expected to give good quantitative results , though of course it means we can only study s - wave pairing .",
    "we use the formalism , described in detail in the next section , to calculate the critical temperature , @xmath1 and the isotope coefficient , @xmath36 , by looking at the instability of the normal state .",
    "also , within the superconducting state , we calculate the superconducting gap , @xmath37 , and the thermodynamic critical field , @xmath38 , from the free - energy difference , @xmath39 .",
    "we point out in particular those results which deviate from migdal - eliashberg theory , and arise from vertex corrections or a non - constant density of states . by including a coulomb pseudopotential , which causes the same change in @xmath1 as vertex corrections , we are able to demonstrate what experiments can be used to differentiate between vertex corrections and a coulomb pseudopotential .",
    "section ii contains the formalism , describing the particular approximations we use , and explaining how our calculations are carried out .",
    "section iii presents our computational results , including a number of graphs depicting the various quantities that can be determined experimentally for real systems .",
    "we make our conclusions in section iv , which is followed by an appendix which gives the detailed formula withheld from section ii .",
    "in our calculations , we use four different types of conserving approximations , which will be expounded below .",
    "four different approximations are necessary , in order to reveal how dressing the ` bare ' phonons affects solutions of the model , as well as to demonstrate the effects of vertex corrections .",
    "each approximation includes a specific self - energy , and hence a specific vertex function , as shown in figures  [ fig : self]-[fig : vert ] . in short ,",
    "these can be described as ( a )  migdal - eliashberg approximation with a truncated dressing of phonons ; ( b )  second - order perturbation theory , which contains vertex corrections and a truncated dressing of phonons ; ( c )  migdal - eliashberg theory with dressed phonons ; and ( d )  vertex - corrected theory with dressed phonons .",
    "the calculations are carried out on the imaginary axis  @xcite , with the green s functions and self - energies defined at matsubara frequencies , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the temperature .",
    "the self - energies are calculated from the derivative of an appropriate free - energy functional , @xmath32 , as : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , while the irreducible vertex function for superconductivity is given by : @xmath44 .",
    "figure  [ fig : free ] shows the feynman diagrams which correspond to the appropriate free - energy functional , @xmath32 , for each of the four calculations , while we defer the specific formulae to the appendix . in the diagrams ,",
    "taking a functional derivative corresponds to cutting and removing the appropriate green s function line .",
    "when calculating properties for the superconducting state , we must use the nambu formalism  @xcite , where the electron green s function and self - energy are represented by a @xmath45 matrix : @xmath46^{-1 } , \\label{eq : greeng}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the approximate form for the non - interacting electron density of states on a 3d cubic lattice as shown in figure  [ fig : dos3d ] , given by uhrig  @xcite , and @xmath48 here , the diagonal and off - diagonal green s functions are defined respectively as : @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes time - ordering in @xmath51 .",
    "the definitions of @xmath52 and @xmath53 for each calculation are given in the appendix , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : selfa])-([eq : dselfd ] ) , and are represented in figure  [ fig : self ] .",

    "the appropriate matsubara frequencies , @xmath58 , in this case , are those which lead to bosonic statistics , such that @xmath59 .",
    "when we use bare phonons , and have no vertex corrections , the electron self - energy is illustrated in figure  [ fig : self](a ) .",
    "the first term is the hartree contribution , @xmath60 .",
    "it can be included by a shift of the chemical potential as it only contributes a constant to the diagonal part of the self - energy , @xmath52 .",
    "such a shift is implicitly included when @xmath26 appears in a green s function , so that the hartree term is hereafter neglected .",
    "it is followed by the fock term , then a single - phonon dressing term , where the phonon line includes a single loop , which is the electron polarizability , @xmath61 : @xmath62 , \\label{eq : chi}\\ ] ] with the factor of two arising from the summation over spin .",
    "the third term includes dressing of phonons in a truncated manner , and allows us to make comparison with the complete second - order approximation , in figure  [ fig : self](b ) , where the only difference is the inclusion of the vertex - correction term .",
    "the specific formula for the extra term in figure  [ fig : self](b ) , which enters our calculations when we include vertex corrections using bare phonons , is given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : selfb ] ) and  ( [ eq : phib ] ) .",
    "the extra contributions to the self - energy coming from vertex corrections have opposite sign to the fock term , near half - filling , where the product of two electronic green s functions is negative ( the green s functions are pure imaginary at half - filling ) . away from half - filling ,",
    "the green s functions gain real parts , which means that near the band edges the product of two green s functions can be positive , and the vertex - correction terms then add to the fock term .    in the calculations with dressed phonons , we have a dyson s equation for the phonon propagator , as depicted in figure  [ fig : dself ] : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the phonon self - energy .",
    "note that within the conserving approximations , we must determine the phonon self - energy by differentiating the free - energy functional : @xmath65 with no vertex corrections , the phonon self - energy is simply given by the electron polarization , as depicted in figure  [ fig : dself](a ) .",
    "that is , @xmath66 in this case , we use the contributions to the electron self - energy that are shown in figure  [ fig : self](c ) , whose explicit formula is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : selfc ] ) .",
    "note that the term with the single polarization bubble is missing , as all orders of such ` necklace ' diagrams are included in the fock term with the dressed phonon propagator .    when we include vertex corrections , as well as dressed phonons , the phonon self - energy gains the extra term shown in figure  [ fig : dself](b ) .",
    "the full expression is given in the appendix [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : dselfd ] ) ] .",
    "note that a fully dressed phonon propagator is included in the phonon self - energy .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : self](d ) , the electron self - energy now has the expected extra term with a crossing of phonon lines .",
    "it is almost identical to the extra term in figure  [ fig : self](b ) , except of course , now the phonons are dressed .",
    "again , the details of the formula can be found in the appendix .",
    "our calculations all involve iteration of the green s functions and self - energies , until a self - consistent solution is reached .",
    "we begin with the non - interacting green s functions ( set the self - energies to zero ) , and use it to calculate an initial estimate of the self - energies , according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : selfa]-[eq : dselfd ] ) .",
    "the new self - energies are used to calculate updated green s functions , according to eqs .",

    "the procedure is iterated , so that at each step there is an updated self - energy , which includes a fraction of the previous self - energy , the exact fraction variable , dependent upon the progress of the iteration .",
    "we stop the process when the change in all the self - energies is less than one part in @xmath67 , which is typically after tens , but sometimes after hundreds of iteration steps .",
    "superconductivity occurs below a critical temperature , @xmath1 , where the normal state becomes unstable to fluctuations in the pairing potential ( the cooper instability ) .",
    "the instability shows itself as a divergence in the pairing susceptibility , @xmath68 , which is given by : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the irreducible vertex function , to be defined shortly .",
    "the bare susceptibility in the superconducting channel for momentum , @xmath71 , is defined as : @xmath72 which becomes in the local approximation ( for the zero - momentum pair ) : @xmath73}{\\omega_{m }   z(i\\omega_{m } ) } , \\ ] ] where @xmath74 .",

    "the irreducible vertex function , @xmath70 is given by the functional derivative of the off - diagonal self - energy , with respect to the off - diagonal green s function : @xmath76 as the pairing fluctuations lead to an instability of the normal state , @xmath77 must be calculated in the normal state ( _ i.e. _ in the limit @xmath78 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : vert ] shows the contributions to the irreducible vertex function for each of the four approximations .",
    "each diagram is achieved by removal of one electron green s function line , from a self - energy diagram in figure  [ fig : self ] .",
    "the algebraic expressions for each of the four sets of diagrams are given in the appendix .    as we wish to uncover more than the phase diagram given by the different perturbation approximations , we move on to describe how we calculate other properties . in order to find the superconducting gap and thermodynamic quantities ,",
    "calculations are required within the superconducting state , but a simple addition to the previous computations in the normal state allows us to calculate the isotope coefficient .    the isotope coefficient , @xmath36 , describes how the critical temperature changes with the phonon mass , @xmath20 .",
    "it is defined as : @xmath79 so that @xmath80 .",
    "the weak - coupling limit of bcs theory , and migdal - eliashberg theory with no coulomb repulsion , predict @xmath81 , which corresponds to @xmath82 .",
    "the phonon frequency changes with mass , according to @xmath83 , so both the product , @xmath84 , and the interaction energy , @xmath24 , remain constant .",
    "hence we calculate the isotope coefficient simply by changing the phonon frequency by @xmath85% ( corresponding to a typical mass change of @xmath86% between isotopes ) and comparing the change in critical temperature . to be precise , we compute @xmath36 by : @xmath87 so the bcs result is achieved if @xmath88 .    according to standard methods  @xcite ,",
    "the energy gap in the superconducting state , @xmath37 , requires a self - consistent calculation within the superconducting state .",

    "we are interested in the free - energy difference between normal and superconducting states at fixed electron filling , @xmath27 , in which case the first , hartree , term in @xmath32 is neglected as it is a constant , @xmath94 . the final term , @xmath95 , can not be neglected , because the chemical potential can differ considerably between the superconducting and normal state when one includes the effects of non - constant density of states .",
    "we calculate the thermodynamic critical field in the superconducting state , @xmath38 , from the free - energy difference between the superconducting and normal state , according to the formula .",
    "the thermodynamic field varies with temperature in an almost quadratic manner , so that calculation of the deviation function , which is defined as the difference between @xmath96 and the quadratic form , @xmath97 $ ] gives a sensitive test of changes in thermodynamic quantities .    in the calculations which include a coulomb repulsion term @xmath98 , we make the standard simplification  @xcite of only including its effects on the off - diagonal self - energy .",
    "this simplification is valid , as the normal - state green s functions in reality include the coulomb repulsion effects , and these change by very little for the diagonal part of the green s function when superconducting order is present . as our model",
    "does not include the effects of @xmath98 on the diagonal green s functions , it is not strictly the solution of a simple hamiltonian with a @xmath98 term included  @xcite .",
    "however , the simplification does allow us to compare the effects of including a coulomb repulsion versus adding vertex corrections , on the superconducting properties and transition temperature from a similar normal state and it is precisely the method employed in analyzing experimental data on real materials .",
    "with these comments understood , the only changes to the calculations that are necessary with the inclusion of a coulomb term , are that both the off - diagonal self - energy , @xmath53 , and the irreducible vertex function , @xmath77 gain an extra term : @xmath99 in the computational calculations , the matsubara frequency sum is cut off after a constant number , @xmath100 , of terms .",

    "this is different from the conventional approach in real materials because here our energy cutoff is governed by the electronic bandwidth , not some multiple of the maximum phonon frequency . to make contact with the standard formalism",

    "@xmath98 is kept fixed , so that @xmath0 varies to a small extent .",
    "finally , we wish to make clear how @xmath2 , the measure of the electron - phonon coupling strength , is defined in our work .",
    "a precise definition is required , because different methods of calculating @xmath2 lead to different results away from the weak - coupling limit , especially when the phonons are dressed . here",
    ", @xmath2 is given by : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the zero - frequency component of the _ dressed _ phonon propagator , which can be significantly different from that of the ` bare ' propagator , @xmath110 .",
    "this value of @xmath2 is usually different from the electronic mass enhancement parameter , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath111 , as the two are only equal in the weak - coupling limit and with @xmath112 .",
    "the definition of @xmath2 is identical to that commonly calculated from the electron - phonon spectral density  @xcite , @xmath113 , namely : @xmath114 where @xmath115\\ ] ] the real - axis form of the phonon propagator , @xmath116 , is calculated from its imaginary - axis values , @xmath54 , by a pad analytic continuation .",
    "in choosing the parameters used to carry out the calculations , a number of criterion had to be satisfied .",
    "firstly , we wished to operate outside the weak - coupling regime , so that vertex corrections would not be negligible .",
    "the phonon frequency needed to be large compared to conventional low - temperature superconductors , but not so large that it gave no realistic point of contact with those superconductors mentioned in the introduction .",
    "so we choose @xmath117 , equal to one - twelfth of the bandwidth .",
    "we had to ensure the electron - phonon coupling strength was not so strong that the ground state would contain bipolarons  @xcite , making the perturbation expansion about a fermi liquid state invalid . a maximum coupling of @xmath118",
    ", hence a bare @xmath119 ensured this . finally , in order to calculate properties in an achievable time",
    ", while ensuring the imaginary frequency cut - offs were at energies larger than the band - width , the temperature of the calculations could not be too small , hence @xmath120 .",
    "the last condition meant that results within the superconducting state were best carried out for as large @xmath24 and @xmath23 as possible , so that @xmath1 would be high .",
    "hence , calculations near the band - edges , where the density of states was low , prove to be inaccurate , due to the very low transition temperatures there .",
    "our first result is that dressing the ` bare ' phonon propagator leads to considerable renormalization effects . to be specific , the value of @xmath2 doubles from it",
    "s ` bare ' value of @xmath121 , to @xmath122 after dressing the phonons , using parameters @xmath123 and @xmath124 , near half - filling .",
    "moreover , at the increased interaction strength of @xmath118 , @xmath2 is enhanced by a factor of _ three _ from the value of @xmath125 for undressed phonons to the dressed value of @xmath126 .",
    "such an enhancement indicates that the perturbation expansion would be inaccurate at bare coupling strengths lower than might be naively expected .",
    "figure  [ fig : dofw ] shows how @xmath113 is altered from its ` bare ' value , a delta - function situated at @xmath127 , when it is dressed .",
    "note that there is both a shift to lower frequencies as well as a broadening of the spectrum .",
    "the shift to lower frequencies shows that a holstein model with ` bare ' phonon frequencies of near @xmath128 of the bandwidth can be required to lead to dressed phonon frequencies at approximately @xmath129 of the bandwidth .",
    "hence the exact phonon self - energy used is an important factor when modeling electron - phonon systems , near the crossover between the weak - coupling and strong - coupling regimes .",
    "the preceding paragraph explains some of the dramatic differences between the critical temperature ( @xmath1 ) values for the different approximations , shown in figure  [ fig : tc ] .",
    "in particular , the @xmath1 for dressed phonons is markedly higher than that for bare phonons , which is to be expected as @xmath2 is also higher .",
    "note that the transition temperatures fall rapidly with increasing filling , above a filling of about @xmath130 , as the electronic density of states drops significantly in this region .",
    "vertex corrections seriously reduce @xmath1 near half - filling ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the two curves with dressed phonons in figure  [ fig : tc ] show a greater disparity than the two curves with ` bare ' phonons in the same figure , which means that dressing the phonons , which increases the effective coupling , enhances the effect of vertex corrections .",
    "although it is hard to distinguish the curves due to the low @xmath1 near the band edge , above a filling of @xmath131 the vertex corrections do lead to an enhancement of @xmath1 .",
    "this result is in agreement with previous work  @xcite .",
    "note that all results show particle - hole symmetry , that is , they are symmetric about half - filling .",
    "the figures just show half of the band ( @xmath132 ) , neglecting a mirror image below half - filling .",
    "it is clear that vertex corrections do change @xmath1 by a considerable amount , but for any experimental measurement , where the microscopic parameters are not known , a coulomb pseudopotential , @xmath0 , can always be fitted to give the same @xmath1 as vertex - corrections .",
    "hence we continue with other results , to see where vertex corrections can not simply be mimicked by an appropriate @xmath0 , which would cause the effects of vertex corrections to be unobservable .",
    "so we fit a @xmath0 to give the same value of @xmath1 as vertex corrections , and go on to change the unobservable electron - phonon coupling strength , @xmath24 , to give the same @xmath2 as vertex corrections , when phonons are dressed .",
    "hence the effects of vertex corrections can show up as discrepancies over a range of quantities compared to the values obtained with a fitted @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ucvert ] is a direct comparison between the effects of vertex corrections and a coulomb pseudopotential , @xmath0 , on the value of the gap parameter .",
    "our first method is to fix the bare electron - phonon coupling and to adjust the value of @xmath98 and hence @xmath0 in a calculation without vertex corrections , until the same @xmath1 is reached as found in the calculation with vertex corrections ( shown in figure  [ fig : tc](b ) ) .",
    "@xmath98 is then used unchanged , to calculate other properties such as the gap parameter .",
    "the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath0 varies with electron filling at @xmath1 as shown in the inset .",
    "notice that an artificial value of @xmath133 is required when @xmath134 , as vertex corrections enhance @xmath1 in this region . near",
    "half - filling , where @xmath0 is positive , and reduces @xmath1 like vertex corrections , the gap parameter is reduced by a smaller amount .",
    "hence a coulomb repulsion leads to slightly higher gap ratio than vertex corrections .",
    "the second curve , with a lower value of @xmath0 , is an alternate approach , where both the dressed value of @xmath2 and @xmath1 are fitted to the results with vertex corrections .",
    "a simple fit to @xmath1 with a fixed bare coupling leads to a higher @xmath2 with a coulomb repulsion than with vertex corrections , because @xmath2 is determined through the dressed phonon propagator . as a conventional analysis",
    "would fit @xmath2 to the experimental data , as well as @xmath0 , this second method follows the spirit of our paper by trying to fit conventional theory to the vertex - corrected results . in order to give the same values of @xmath2 , the electron - phonon interaction energy had to be varied , and",
    "in fact reduced by 10% at half - filling .",
    "the result is a lower value of the gap ratio than with only @xmath0 fitted , but still a slightly larger value than with vertex corrections alone .",
    "although the magnitude of the gap varies considerably , depending upon the approximation used , figure  [ fig : rat ] shows that the gap ratio , @xmath135 , varies less markedly .",
    "the gap ratio is greater than @xmath136 in the case of dressed phonons without vertex corrections , which is typical of the strong coupling regime ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "note that when the phonons are ` bare ' , so the coupling is less strong , the inclusion of vertex corrections , while strongly reducing @xmath1 and @xmath37 individually , has little effect on the ratio , @xmath138 .",
    "the isotope coefficient , @xmath36 , has a value of @xmath139 in the simplest , bcs , approximation , and in migdal - eliashberg theory with no coulomb repulsion .",
    "the reason is that the phonon frequency provides the only cut - off for the coupling between different states , and phonon frequencies are proportional to @xmath140 , where @xmath20 is the ionic mass .",
    "inclusion of a frequency - independent coulomb repulsion , @xmath98 , leads to a reduction in @xmath36 , as does a finite bandwidth . the reduction in @xmath36",
    ", indicates that the increase in phonon frequency is less effective at increasing @xmath1 than otherwise .",
    "higher - frequency phonons reduce the retardation in the electron - electron attraction , so the coulomb repulsion between electrons is less shielded .",
    "the finite bandwidth means that the number of states coupled together includes a factor independent of phonon frequency , so @xmath1 does not increase with @xmath23 as it might if there were an infinite number of electron states extending through all energies .",
    "it is known  @xcite that migdal - eliashberg theory with a finite bandwidth and including a coulomb repulsion , leads to the allowed range of values for the isotope coefficient , @xmath141 . including a non - constant density of states  @xcite can in principle lead to any positive value of @xmath36 .",
    "the reason being that @xmath1 increases because extra electron states near the chemical potential are able to couple together when the phonon frequency increases .",
    "if the density of states increases significantly in the region of energy where new states are coupled together , the increase in @xmath1 is much higher than would otherwise be expected , and @xmath36 can be large , even greater than @xmath139 .",
    "the corollary is that if the density of states decreases away from the chemical potential , @xmath36 also decreases , but never to less than zero , as @xmath1 does not go down when the number of states coupled together goes up .",
    "figure  [ fig : iso ] shows that the inclusion of vertex corrections in the calculations with dressed phonons not only reduces @xmath36 , but can in fact lead to negative values .",
    "indeed , the strongest reduction in @xmath36 by vertex corrections occurs near half - filling , and at strong coupling , where @xmath1 is comparatively large . by comparison , in all cases the coulomb pseudopotential , which gives",
    "the same reduction in @xmath1 as vertex corrections , leads to a much smaller reduction in @xmath36 . in migdal - eliashberg",
    "theory , a very small value of @xmath36 requires a very low @xmath1 .",
    "hence , any observation of isotope effects which have @xmath142 , or a small @xmath36 with moderate to high @xmath1 , implies that either vertex corrections are involved or some other mechanism outside of migdal - eliashberg theory is important .",
    "paramagnetic impurities  @xcite , proximity effects  @xcite , anharmonicity  @xcite , and an isotopic dependence of the electron density in the conduction band  @xcite , can also lead to a low or negative @xmath36 without requiring a low @xmath1 .",
    "one or more of these effects may be important , in those materials with anomalously low values of @xmath36  @xcite , but vertex corrections should also be considered .",
    "an important effect of dressing the phonons is that a small increase in the bare phonon frequency does not just result in a constant shift of @xmath113 , through a rescaling of the frequency variable .",
    "when calculating the isotope effect , it is common to assume that a mass substitution simply rescales the frequency , otherwise maintaining the same form of @xmath113 .",
    "however , the phonon self - energy is not independent of frequency , so the magnitude of @xmath113 at its peak , which is inversely proportional to the imaginary part of the self - energy at that frequency , does not remain constant .",
    "in fact , the peak height is reduced by an increase in peak frequency , resulting in a slight reduction in @xmath2 .",
    "hence the increase in @xmath1 with bare frequency is less than otherwise expected , reducing the isotope coefficient for dressed phonons .",
    "interestingly , when the phonons are undressed , the coulomb repulsion leads to a very small increase in @xmath36 .",
    "this arises , because the term with a single polarization bubble ( the first order term coming from dressed phonons ) is present .",
    "the term acts to reduce @xmath36 , but is less significant at the lower transition temperatures caused by the coulomb pseudopotential .",
    "meanwhile , the increase in @xmath143 with temperature , which acts to reduce @xmath36 is a much smaller effect .",
    "the free - energy difference , @xmath144 , is plotted as a function of filling , @xmath27 , in figure  [ fig : endiff ] . in the simplest picture ,",
    "true in the weak - coupling limit , one expects the magnitude of the free - energy difference to be approximately equal to @xmath145 , representing a number of states , @xmath146 , each shifted by an average energy of order @xmath147 .",
    "although , with @xmath148 given by @xmath149 , the weak - coupling result predicts too high a condensation energy  @xcite , it does explain the qualitative changes between the different curves of figure  [ fig : endiff ] .",
    "in fact , the dimensionless quantity , @xmath150 [ the sommerfeld constant , @xmath151 changes little for these curves . at half - filling , with dressed phonons ,",
    "the value is reduced from the bcs constant result of 0.168 to a strong - coupling value of 0.137 .",
    "the value with vertex corrections is 0.157 , while with the coulomb pseudopotential it is 0.149 .",
    "hence , as with the gap ratio , near half - filling , vertex corrections cause quantities to be closer to the weak - coupling values than does a coulomb pseudopotential fitted for the same @xmath1 .",
    "the values at a filling of @xmath152 are all closer to the weak - coupling limit , as expected when the density of states falls .",
    "the result is 0.163 for dressed phonons without vertex corrections , changing little to 0.165 with a coulomb pseudopotential and 0.158 with vertex corrections .",
    "it is worthwhile pointing out that the difference in thermodynamic potentials , which is usually calculated as an approximation to the free - energy difference , leads to very different results away from half - filling .",
    "the approximation is based on the assumption that the chemical potential changes little between normal and superconducting states , but this is not necessarily the case when there is a non - constant density of states .",
    "in fact , there is a particularly large shift from the normal - state chemical potential , @xmath153 , to that in the superconducting state , @xmath154 , if @xmath153 lies near the van hove singularity , where the non - interacting density of states is falling precipitously .",
    "this can be understood , by considering how states above and below the normal - state chemical potential , @xmath153 , couple together and create an energy gap . when the density of states is falling rapidly with increasing energy , electronic states from a larger energy region above @xmath153 couple to those in a small region below @xmath153 .",
    "the resulting energy gap is skewed up in energy , so the chemical potential in the superconducting state , @xmath154 , which sits in the middle of the gap , becomes greater than @xmath153 . in the mirrored example below half - filling , near @xmath155 ,",
    "@xmath154 is also pushed away from half - filling , so we find @xmath156 there .",
    "the thermodynamic critical field , @xmath38 , is effectively the square root of the free - energy difference , so shows qualitatively the same effects .",
    "@xmath38 is known  @xcite to vary with temperature in a manner close to the behavior @xmath157 $ ] which corresponds to the two - fluid model .",
    "the deviation function , plotted in figure  [ fig : dev ] , is the difference between the reduced critical field , @xmath158 , and the quadratic fit , @xmath159 .",
    "the curve without vertex corrections at half - filling shows a small positive deviation , with a maximum of @xmath160 , typical of strong - coupling superconductors .",
    "interestingly , when vertex corrections are included , the deviation function at half - filling becomes negative , showing a minimum of about @xmath161 , which is more typical of weak - coupling superconductors ( bcs theory predicts a minimum of @xmath162 ) .",
    "this result fits in with those for other properties , demonstrating that vertex corrections reduce the effective coupling strength , near half - filling .",
    "a coulomb pseudopotential , with the same power to reduce @xmath1 as vertex corrections , also decreases the deviation function , but to a lesser extent than vertex corrections do so .",
    "this is still true when the value of @xmath2 is also fitted , by altering @xmath24 as necessary .",
    "the calculations away from the band - center , at @xmath152 , lead to a negative deviation for all approximations .",
    "the reduced density of states at this filling leads to weak - coupling behavior .",
    "other thermodynamic quantities , which can be derived from the free - energy data , are affected in similar ways .",
    "that is , vertex corrections reduce the effective coupling strength , to a greater extent than does a coulomb repulsion giving the same @xmath1 .",
    "for example , vertex corrections reduce the specific heat jump , @xmath163 at @xmath1 , as does a coulomb repulsion to a lesser extent .",
    "the following results are obtained by a numerical differentiation , so are not completely accurate in themselves , ( perhaps only to 10% ) but as much of the error is systematic , the trends are reliable . at half - filling , the dimensionless quantity , @xmath164 is reduced from the strong - coupling value of 2.44 , to 1.63 with vertex corrections and 1.88 with a coulomb pseudopotential ( the bcs result is 1.43 ) .",
    "again , notice the typical result that near half - filling , vertex - corrections lead to a weaker - coupling result than does inclusion of a coulomb pseudopotential .",
    "at an electron filling of @xmath152 , the results indicate less strong coupling , giving @xmath165 for dressed phonons , with the value reduced to 1.53 by vertex corrections , and to 1.44 by a coulomb repulsion .",
    "we have completed a numerical investigation of the effects of vertex corrections , dressing phonons and a non - constant density of states on the physical properties of strong - coupling superconductors .",
    "we solved the holstein model , using four distinct perturbation theories , within conserving approximations .",
    "the necessity of incorporating a realistic phonon self - energy is of considerable importance to those working with model hamiltonians .",
    "the use of dressed phonons in the holstein model , leads to a large renormalization of the parameters - in particular , the value of @xmath2 can be enhanced by a factor of @xmath166 , when its ` bare ' value of @xmath167 would suggest the system is in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "such an enhancement of @xmath2 reveals itself in increased @xmath1 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and a gap ratio ( @xmath168 ) greater than 4 .",
    "the real - frequency data shows that the einstein spectrum ( a delta - function at @xmath23 ) is both broadened and peaked at a lower frequency , when the bare , einstein phonons are dressed .",
    "the non - constant density of states affects migdal - eliashberg results in both expected and unexpected ways .",
    "firstly , all quantities which depend on the density of states as a parameter within migdal - eliashberg theory change in the expected manner as the electron band - filling changes . note that any sharp features in the normal electronic density of states have their effects reduced by the ` averaging ' over a large phonon frequency range .",
    "hence the strong fall in @xmath1 and @xmath37 is expected at both small and large fillings ( @xmath169 and @xmath170 ) due to the rapid fall in the density of states in our model .",
    "more subtle , is the result that the chemical potential shifts by a considerable amount between the normal and superconducting states , if it lies near a van hove singularity . to observe such an effect ,",
    "the superconductor would have to be coupled to one with a more constant density of states .",
    "we find , in agreement with previous work  @xcite , that vertex corrections lead to results that correspond to a reduced effective strength of the electron - phonon coupling near half - filling , but an increased coupling strength near the band edges .",
    "these effects are exemplified by reductions in critical temperature , @xmath1 , superconducting gap , @xmath37 , isotope coefficient , @xmath36 , and thermodynamic critical field , @xmath38 , near half - filling . as nearly all of these effects",
    "can be modeled by an appropriate coulomb pseudopotential , @xmath0 , it makes it extremely difficult for any single experiment to reveal that vertex corrections have played a significant role .",
    "however , we do find some trends worth pointing out .",
    "firstly , if there is difficulty in fitting both @xmath1 and @xmath37 with a given @xmath113 and @xmath0 , then this is an indication that vertex corrections may contribute , since they affect the ratio @xmath168 for fixed @xmath1 , reducing it near half - filling .",
    "secondly , if the experimentally measured deviation function for the thermodynamic critical field lies below the predicted value [ with a given @xmath113 and @xmath0 ] vertex corrections could be important .",
    "thirdly , a theoretical prediction , ignoring vertex corrections , will overestimate the specific heat jump at @xmath1 .",
    "finally , a more striking result , is in the isotope coefficient , @xmath36 , which vertex corrections reduce much more markedly than does @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , vertex corrections can lead to @xmath172 , which @xmath0 alone can never do  @xcite . hence materials that have moderate to large @xmath1s , but small isotope coefficients can still be electron - phonon mediated superconductors with vertex corrections included . as the isotope coefficient is the single experimental quantity affected the most by vertex corrections , it is important to consider materials which have @xmath36 unexplained by migdal - eliashberg theory .",
    "anomalously low , and even negative isotope coefficients have been observed in materials , such as ru  @xcite , @xmath36-uranium  @xcite , pdh  @xcite , and la@xmath173sr@xmath174cuo@xmath175  @xcite , where vertex corrections are probably not important , and other mechanisms , such as anharmonicity , conduction electron density variations and paramagnetic impurities play a role .",
    "however , a system such as rb@xmath176c@xmath7  @xcite , where the phonon frequency is a sizable fraction of the electron bandwidth , is much more likely to have vertex corrections affect the value of @xmath36 .    still , the best way to see the effects of vertex corrections is to directly view their contribution in the multiphonon region of a tunnel junction , or in the high - energy region of the optical conductivity",
    "so , in order to unequivocally demonstrate the presence of strong vertex corrections in a material , more accurate dynamical measurements at energies beyond the highest phonon frequencies need to be carried out .",

    "<S> we calculate the effects of vertex corrections , of non - constant density of states and of a ( self - consistently determined ) phonon self - energy for the holstein model on a 3d cubic lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we replace vertex corrections with a coulomb pseudopotential , @xmath0 , adjusted to give the same @xmath1 , and repeat the calculations , to see which effects are a distinct feature of vertex corrections . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to determine directly observable effects of vertex corrections on a variety of thermodynamic properties of superconductors . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we employ conserving approximations ( in the local approximation ) to calculate the superconducting critical temperatures , isotope coefficients , superconducting gaps , free - energy differences and thermodynamic critical fields for a range of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the dressed value of @xmath2 is significantly larger than the bare value . </S>",
    "<S> while vertex corrections can cause significant changes in all the above quantities ( even when the bare electron - phonon coupling is small ) , the changes can usually be well - modeled by an appropriate coulomb pseudopotential . </S>",
    "<S> the isotope coefficient proves to be the quantity that most clearly shows effects of vertex corrections that can not be mimicked by a @xmath0 .    1.0 in </S>"
