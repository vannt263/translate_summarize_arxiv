    "the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) is a paradigmatic model for driven diffusive systems @xcite .",
    "tasep is particularly used for modeling transport in a wide variety of nonequilibrium systems , _",
    "e.g. _ motion of molecular motors on microtubules @xcite , filamentous fungal growth @xcite and flow of traffic on a road @xcite .",
    "the model is defined on a one dimensional lattice on which hardcore particles perform biased diffusion . despite its simplicity , this model shows interesting properties like the existence of a phase transition in one dimension , which are hallmarks of nonequilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "one widely - studied variant of the tasep is defined on an open lattice where in addition to performing biased diffusion , the system can also exchange particles with the reservoirs at the boundaries . in this open system , particles are injected at one end and extracted at the other end of the lattice and by tuning these injection and extraction rates one finds that the system shows a boundary induced phase transition @xcite .",
    "the resulting phase diagram was derived using exact calculations and an alternative simpler derivation was also presented using mean field theory @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram consists of a high density phase , a low density phase and a maximal current phase .",
    "as the names suggest , the high density ( low density ) phase is characterized by a large ( small ) bulk density and the maximal current phase by the presence of largest admissible current in the system .",
    "the open chain tasep is widely used to model transport in complex biological systems @xcite .",
    "owing to the inherent complexity of a biological system , transport processes are generally coupled with other biochemical reactions . at the entry and exit terminals other reactions can take place whose outcome may influence the injection and exit processes strongly .",
    "such a situation was considered in @xcite where the species of particles undergoing transport were assumed to take part in other reactions before or after the transport _",
    "i.e. _ entrance or exit are possible only when certain reactions take place .",
    "the system was modeled as an open - chain tasep with stochastically mediated entrance or exit , facilitated by gates present at the boundaries .",
    "the opening and closing of the gate at the exit ( entrance ) terminal is determined by the binding and unbinding of certain receptor ( initiator ) to the gate . when the receptor ( initiator ) is bound to the gate",
    ", the particles can pass through the gate and exit ( enter ) the channel . when the gate at the exit ( entrance ) end is not bound to any receptor ( initiator ) , it is assumed to be in a closed state when no particle can pass through .",
    "one important component in this model is the two - way coupling between the gate dynamics and the particle flow .",
    "when a particle passes through an open gate , the receptor ( initiator ) immediately unbinds , _",
    "i.e. _ the particles ` close the gate behind them ' .",
    "the new phase diagram for this model was studied using monte carlo simulations and mean - field theory .",
    "one physical system , where stochastic gates are explicitly present and control cellular transport , can be found in ion - channels , which are embedded on cell membrane and exchange of ions between cells takes place through these channels @xcite .",
    "an ion - channel stochastically switches between ` open ' and ` closed ' conformations and while the open conformation allows fast passage of ions through the channel resulting in a large ion - flux , no transport is possible in the closed state @xcite .",
    "the closed state is also known as the high - affinity state , when the ions strongly bind to the channel and hence gets trapped . in the open conformation ,",
    "the channel is in the low - affinity state and the ions immediately dissociate from the channel and move to the cell cytosol .    in this paper , we explicitly model the gating dynamics , following the modeling strategy used to describe ion - channel gating @xcite , and study its effect on the transport .",
    "we consider a generalization of an open chain tasep , where the injection and extraction processes at the two boundaries are controlled by the presence of gates or special boundary sites , which can stochastically switch between high- and low - affinity states , as described above . while in the high - affinity state ,",
    "a particle gets trapped in the gate , in the low - affinity state it immediately dissociates from the gate and moves towards right .",
    "our monte carlo simulations show that the inclusion of the above gating mechanism produces interesting and non - trivial modifications in the phase diagram .",
    "the residence time of the gates in the open state are important parameters here and depending on their value all three phases may or may not be observed . for example , unlike in ordinary tasep , sufficiently large values of the injection and exit rates do not always yield an mc phase  the residence time of the gates in the open state must exceed certain critical values for mc phase to be observed . to explain these results we perform analytical calculations within mean - field theory .",
    "a simple mean - field theory where all correlations in the system are ignored , shows qualitative agreement with the simulation results but there is significant quantitative mismatch . to improve the quantitative agreement",
    ", we use a refined mean - field theory , developed in @xcite , where important correlations at the boundaries are taken into account and this approach yields better agreement with the simulation data .    in the next section",
    "we briefly summarize earlier results on the phase diagram for an ordinary open chain tasep and then introduce our stochastic gated model in detail . in section",
    "[ sec : sim ] , we present the results of monte carlo simulation of our model .",

    "the gating dynamics is modeled so as to mimic ion - channel gating ",
    "these gates can stochastically switch between high - affinity ( closed ) and low - affinity ( open ) states .",
    "the configuration of the system is specified by specifying the occupancy of each site and the state of the gates at the boundaries .",
    "if the gate at site @xmath1 is in the closed or high - affinity state , then the injected particle strongly binds to the site and therefore remains trapped in that site .",

    "but if the gate is open then the particle exits the system with probability @xmath3 . because of the hard core constraint , no particle can enter the gate if it is already occupied .",

    "one important point to note here is that even in the limit @xmath24 , _",
    "i.e. _ when the gates are always in the open state , our model does not map onto regular open - chain tasep .",
    "since the gating dynamics in our system is motivated by the models for ion - channel gating @xcite , an open state or low - affinity state of the gate implies that any particle arriving at the gate immediately detaches and goes to the next site , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model]b @xcite .",
    "this effect is not present for a regular tasep where the waiting time at the boundary sites is decided according to the rules of usual stochastic update .",

    "a particle gets trapped in a closed gate as before , and it is allowed to leave while the gate is open , but it does not immediately dissociate from an open gate .",

    "in this paper , we have studied the phase diagram of an open - chain tasep whose entrance and exit at the boundaries are controlled by two gates , whose dynamics are chosen so as to mimic ion - channel gates in cell membrane . in our model , these gates can switch between a high - affinity state , when it strongly binds to the particles thereby trapping them , and a low - affinity state , when particle immediately dissociates from the gates and move to the next site .",
    "this immediate dissociation implies even in the limit when the gates are always open , our model does not map onto a regular open - chain tasep .",
    "however , all our results and conclusions remain valid in a slightly different version of the model , where there is no immediate dissociation in the open state ( see appendix [ sec : passive ] ) and usual tasep limit is recovered , when the gates are always open .",
    "the effect of stochastic gates on the phase diagram was studied earlier where a two - way coupling between the gating dynamics and particle flow was considered @xcite .",
    "while entrance of exit of particles can take place only through an open gate , immediately after passage the gate shuts close . on the other hand , in our model ,",
    "no such two - way coupling is assumed and the gates can switch between two states , completely independent of the particle flow .",
    "even this uncoupled , independent gating dynamics yields important modification in the phase diagram which can not be reproduced by mere rescaling of entrance and exit rates .",
    "stochastic gating , as investigated in our model , allows systems to actively control the phase diagram , and hence the current flow through the lattice , independent of the entry and exit rates .",
    "the entry and exit rates often depend on the concentration of particles near the boundary sites , and gating then allows a mechanism for systems to prevent flow even in the presence of high concentrations ( or equivalently , high entry rate ) and vice versa .",
    "this opens new possibilities for mechanisms for the regulation of particle current , especially in biological systems .",
    "it might be of interest to include more biologically relevant features in our model and check how generic our present results are .",

    "in this section , we discuss a variant of our model that maps onto the regular open - chain tasep in the limit when the gates are always open .",
    "the only difference between this model and the one discussed in the main part of the paper is that in the open state of the gate there is no immediate dissociation . in other words ,",
