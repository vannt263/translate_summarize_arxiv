    "in this section we consider the free decay of a two level atom coupled to a bosonic bath in its vacuum state .",

    "nevertheless we restrict to the single excitation case thus getting :    @xmath99    since @xmath100=0 $ ] the following equalities hold to be true :    @xmath101    so that one has to solve only for the independent variables , namely @xmath102 and @xmath103 . by using the equation @xmath104 and by mean of a change of variables @xmath105 and @xmath106 one is led to solve the following equations :    @xmath107    which are to be solved with the initial conditions @xmath108 . the solution to the first equation",

    "the solution for the last two is obtained by means of the laplace transform as :    @xmath110(s)&=\\left(s+\\sum_{{\\bf q}}\\frac{|g_{{\\bf q}}|^2}{s+\\imath(\\omega_{{\\bf q}}-\\omega_0)}\\right)^{-1},\\\\ \\mathcal{l}[\\tilde \\lambda_{{\\bf q}}(t)](s)&=-\\imath \\frac{g_{{\\bf q}}(t)^{*}}{s+\\imath ( \\omega_{{\\bf q}}-\\omega_0 ) } \\mathcal{l}[\\tilde c_1(t)](s).\\\\ \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    by taking the continuum limit we have    @xmath111    where we introduced the `` spectral density '' of the bath @xmath112 .",

    "the `` propagator '' is then given by @xmath121 .",
    "since the coefficient @xmath122 can take on negative values then for certain instants in time the super - operator @xmath123 could be not of the lindbland form . in",
    "what follows we will have to calculate the action of the super - operator on operators acting on the hilbert space of the system . in order to simplify this calculations",
    "we will use the damping basis , i.e. the basis made up of operators @xmath124 such that @xmath125=\\lambda_i(t)\\ , { \\hat{\\lambda}_{i}^{}(t)}$ ] .",
    "in fact the `` eigen - operators '' @xmath126 are time independent :    [ cols=\"<,^ , < \" , ]     now we switch to the analysis of the above system according to our definition ( see main text ) of markovian regime .",
    "we looked at the two - point correlation functions @xmath127 and @xmath128 as a function of both the control parameter @xmath71 and @xmath129 for different times @xmath130 .",
    "in particular we looked at the parameter @xmath131 .",
    "we can see from figs . 2 and 3 that the system can be considered to be in a markov regime regardless of the value of @xmath71 ( @xmath82 ) , _ i.e. _ regardless of the number of peaks of the initial distribution @xmath80 .",
    "in this section we will evaluate the non - markovianity of the system accordingly to the so - called divisibility measure  @xcite .",
    "moreover we show that it has a link with the classical case in which it is possible to show that in general ( markov and non - markov regimes ) one can construct a set of two - point propagators with the semigroup property .            @xmath133+\\gamma(t)\\left({\\hat{\\sigma}_{-}^{}}{\\hat{\\rho}_{s}^{}(t)}{\\hat{\\sigma}_{+}^{}}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\{{\\hat{\\sigma}_{+}^{}}{\\hat{\\sigma}_{-}^{}},{\\hat{\\rho}_{s}^{}(t)}\\right\\}\\right),\\nonumber\\\\ \\mathcal{l}(t){\\hat{\\rho}_{s}^{}(0)}&=&\\frac{h(t)e^{-h(t)}}{2}\\left({\\hat{\\sigma}_{z}^{}}\\,{\\hat{\\rho}_{s}^{}(0)}\\,{\\hat{\\sigma}_{z}^{}}-\\,{\\hat{\\rho}_{s}^{}(0)}\\right),\\nonumber\\\\ \\mathcal{l}(t){\\hat{\\rho}_{s}^{}(0)}&=&\\frac{dg^{*}(t)}{dt}{\\hat{\\pi}_{h}^{}}\\,{\\hat{\\rho}_{s}^{}(0)}\\,{\\hat{\\pi}_{v}^{}}\\frac{dg(t)}{dt}{\\hat{\\pi}_{v}^{}}\\,{\\hat{\\rho}_{s}^{}(0)}\\,{\\hat{\\pi}_{h}^{}},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]                    we now turn to the question : is it always possible to construct a divisible map which gives the right mean values as in the classical case ?",
    "let us try to follow the argument by hnggi and thomas @xcite .",
    "first we assume that we have solved the problem of finding the dynamical map @xmath137 , which evolves the initial state @xmath138 of a system from @xmath50 to @xmath130 .",
    "in general we can not write @xmath139 :            the inverse evolution @xmath142 acts in such a way that the generator is independent of the initial state , exactly as in the classical case .",
    "the above superoperator is well defined since @xmath143 is known by assumption and @xmath142 is meaningful since we know that the  forward evolution \" @xmath144 started from a meaningful state .",
    "thus @xmath145 represents the infinitesimal generator of a dynamical map , which evolves the system from @xmath130 to @xmath146 .",
    "the dynamical map we are looking for thus satisfies the equation :      the choice of @xmath51 as the second argument is due to the fact that we want @xmath148 to be the initial state of the interrupted evolution .",
    "exactly as in the classical case by changing the initial time @xmath149 it is possible to find a whole set of dynamical maps :        we stress that as in the classical case the new dynamical map will give us only the right mean values , but not the correlation functions .",
    "so in fact we built a dynamical map for a markov process which has the same mean values of the original ( possibly ) non - markovian process but with different correlation functions .",
    "the above equation is very important for our purposes because it shows that the infinitesimal generator of the actual dynamics , namely @xmath123 , is also the generator of the _ ad - hoc _ constructed divisible map @xmath156 .",
    "the dynamical maps @xmath40 has already the semigroup property .",
    "but in eq .",
    "( [ eq : infevol ] ) we can also recognize the ground of the divisibility measure .",
    "it tests whether the infinitesimal evolution from any point @xmath130 up to @xmath157 is a meaningful one .",
    "nevertheless , we have just shown that it is possible to trick this measure by constructing an _ ad - hoc _",
    "map @xmath158 by the knowledge of the map @xmath95 and the initial state @xmath138 ."

    "<S> a universal definition of non - markovianity for open systems dynamics is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> it is extended from the classical definition to the quantum realm by showing that a ` transition ' from the markov to the non - markov regime occurs when the correlations between the system and the environment , generated by their joint evolution , can no longer be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> the suggested definition is based on the comparison between measured correlation functions and those built by assuming that the system is in a markov regime thus giving a figure of merit of the error coming from this assumption . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the knowledge of the dynamical map and initial condition of the system is not enough to fully characterise the non - markovian dynamics of the reduced system . </S>",
    "<S> the example of three exactly solvable models , i.e. decoherence and spontaneous emission of the qubit in a bosonic bath and decoherence of the photon s polarization induced by interaction with its spacial degrees of freedom , reveals that previously proposed markovianity criteria and measures which are based on dynamical map analysis fail to recognise non - markov behaviour .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction _ - the quest for a mathematical description of open quantum system dynamics has lately intensified  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reason has to be sought in the application of this theory to problems such as thermalization of quantum systems  @xcite , transport in non - equilibrium settings  @xcite , dynamics of quantum systems in noisy environments with non trivial correlations  @xcite , and the emergence of irreversibility from microscopic description ( as first studied by lindblad  @xcite ) , to mention a few . from a theoretical perspective </S>",
    "<S> the study of a quantum system requires the knowledge of the mean values of its observables _ and _ their correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are often linked to measurable ( and important ) quantities such as the decay rate of a system , generalized susceptibilities and scattering properties of a field . </S>",
    "<S> a powerful tool for the calculation of the @xmath0-point correlation functions is the so - called quantum regression theorem ( qrt )  @xcite ; it states that the evolution equations of the correlation functions can be related to the evolution equation for the mean values of the observables themselves in the spirit of the onsager hypothesis for classical systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the qrt has been proven to not be the quantum generalization of the onsager hypothesis  @xcite , which means that , in general , there is no other way of calculating the correlation functions but starting from a microscopic model and going through the heisenberg evolution of operators ; this task is often non trivial .    a class of open quantum systems exists , whose mathematical description is fairly simple and for which it is possible to derive a master equation for the time evolution of the density matrix of gorini - kossakowski - sudarshan - lindblad ( gksl ) form  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this equation is said to generate a markovian dynamics because for diagonal density matrices it is equivalent to the pauli equation  @xcite and the solution to the pauli equation is known to fulfill the markov assumption for classical systems . </S>",
    "<S> one of the properties of the gksl master equation is that it generates equations of motion for the correlation functions which have the same structure of the equation of motion for the mean values , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , the qrt holds true for systems described by this equation  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the general evolution of an open system is described by an equation which can be different from the gksl form and in this case it is customary to talk about non - markovian master equations , implicitly assuming that the relation `` gksl form @xmath1 markovian dynamics '' holds . however , unlike in the classical case , in the quantum case there is no clear definition of markovian systems , and it has recently been argued  @xcite that for a quantum system it is not possible to define markovian processes in analogy with the classical case . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the difficulty in defining conditional quantities in quantum mechanics because of the perturbation induced by measurements . in order to better classify the different types of dynamics and distinguish between markovian and non - markovian evolution different measures of non - markovianity </S>",
    "<S> have been proposed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these approaches are based on distinguishability and divisibility of the corresponding maps </S>",
    "<S> . however , in the corresponding classical case these properties of the maps are not sufficient to guarantee the markovianity of the process  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this letter is to give a clear and experimentally testable definition of the markov regime for the dynamics of an open system . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to mention that the proposed definition is valid for quantum and classical dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the definition of the markov process will be based on an appropriate reformulation of the markov assumption for classical stochastic processes  @xcite . as a consequence of our definition </S>",
    "<S> we show why any definition of the markov process based on the analysis of the properties of the dynamical maps only leads to inconclusive results . </S>",
    "<S> we will also show that our definition of the markovian regime has implications for the study of fluctuation relations in open systems  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ markov assumption for classical stochastic systems _ - the description of a classical stochastic system is given , in general , by a set of probability distribution functions @xmath2 , for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> these allow to calculate mean values and multi - times correlation functions as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the value of the stochastic variable @xmath6 of the system at time @xmath7 and the @xmath8 s are functions of the stochastic variable @xmath6 relative to some system s observable ( e.g. , energy , temperature , components of the velocity ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is a particular class of systems whose mathematical description is particularly simple ; they are the ones for which the so - called markov assumption holds true @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the markov assumption for classical systems is stated through the conditional probabilities and reads    @xmath9    where we have defined @xmath10 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn implies that once the two - points conditional probability density distribution and the initial conditions are given one can evaluate _ any _ @xmath0-point ( in time ) correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the system is _ </S>",
    "<S> fully characterized_.    let @xmath12 be the initial probability density , then we can formally write  @xcite    @xmath13    where the @xmath14 are the green s functions that solve the initial problem . </S>",
    "<S> hnggi and thomas showed  @xcite that it is always possible ( markov and non - markov case ) to construct a class of propagators @xmath15 ( for each @xmath0 ) with the semi - group property and which are independent from the initial conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless these green s functions can not be interpreted as conditional probability distribution densities . as pointed out in  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the one point propagators @xmath16 of each semi - group are the conditional probabilities of a markov process which has the same single - event probabilities @xmath17 , _ but different multivariate probabilities @xmath18 _ , as the non - markov process under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the knowledge of the single particle propagator tells nothing about the higher order correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> the same holds true for higher order propagators and this is the crucial starting point for our discussion . </S>",
    "<S> markovianity in a quantum framework is often related to the divisibility , or to the semi - group property , of the so - called dynamical map , and measures of markovianity have been suggested based on this property @xcite . however , in the classical case there is no such direct implication .    _ multivariate correlation functions and definition of the markov regime for quantum dynamics _ - </S>",

    "<S> if the application of @xmath33 gives a non - zero value , the system and environment are correlated initially or at any point during the evolution . using the analogy with the classical case </S>",
    "<S> , the definition of markov regime for quantum dynamics given above can thus be reinterpreted as the dynamical regime in which system - environment correlations are negligible . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn allows us to write a compact expression for the multivariate correlation functions , namely the one given in eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> let us note that the role of correlations between system and environment has recently been pointed out elsewhere in relation to the study of degree of non - markovianity of a quantum map  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the definition given above follows naturally from the classical definition of markovian systems . </S>",
    "<S> this fact was already pointed out more than thirty years ago by grishanin  @xcite for the specific case of an atom interacting with a strong electromagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our formal expression naturally generalizes one proposed by lindblad himself  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , our treatment and derivation above gives it a clear meaning in terms of correlations generated in the joint system - environment dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> _ examples _ - in the following we will consider three exactly solvable toy models in order to test the proposed definition of markovianity : the spontaneous emission of a two level atom in vacuum , decoherence induced on a two level atom by a bosonic bath and decoherence on the photon s polarization induced by interaction with its spatial degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> due to the solvability of these models we obtain the explicit form of the exact unitary operator describing the system - environment interaction and the exact master equation for the reduced system.we will then compare two point correlation functions @xmath60 $ ] calculated with the help of the unitary operator describing system - environment interaction , with those calculated with the dynamical map @xmath40 using eq .  </S>",

    "<S> any difference between the two will be a signature of a transition from the markov to the non - markov regime .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : diss ] shows the dynamics of the relative change @xmath66 for system - bath coupling strength @xmath71 between @xmath74 and @xmath75 . as it is expected for small values of the coupling strength @xmath71 the system is well in the markov regime @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> however , increasing the coupling strength @xmath71 one can see that the dynamics of the system becomes non - markovian and knowledge of the dynamical map @xmath40 is not sufficient for the full description of the system . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to mention that the correlation function @xmath77 is related to the ( non - stationary ) spectrum of the atom , which means that this behaviour is measurable  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially interesting since we can compare our result with recently suggested measures of non - markovianity based on the trace distance @xcite , divisibility of the dynamical map @xcite and the volume of states accessible under the dynamical map @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all these measures are based on the analysis of the dynamical map only and predict the markovian behaviour for the set of parameters used in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diss ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , as it is shown the residual information in the dynamical map is not enough to describe the dynamics of the reduced system , which implies non - markovian dynamics .    for the second example describing pure decoherence of a two - state system interacting with a bosonic bath , </S>",
    "<S> whose spectral density is @xmath78 , we find that @xmath79 at any time . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that decoherence is always a markovian process in the case of a bosonic bath with a continuum of states and dynamical maps give the full description of the system . </S>",
    "<S> however , measures based on the analysis of the properties of the dynamical maps @xcite predict non - markovian evolution for some values of the parameters . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : ham3 ] ) as a function of the control parameter @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the two crossings from non - markovian to markovian regimes are clearly visible and they correspond to the change of @xmath80 from a double to a single peaked distribution . in the inset </S>",
    "<S> we show the divisibility measure for the dynamical map . according to this measure </S>",
    "<S> the map is always markovian.,width=340 ]    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : nmdiv ] we show values of the trace distance measure @xmath81  @xcite for different values of @xmath71 , where @xmath40 denotes the dynamical map describing the evolution of the sub - system of interest . </S>",
    "<S> we can clearly see , as already shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , that according to the trace distance measure @xmath81 the systems goes from a non - markovian to a markovian regime and then back to the non - markovian one . </S>",
    "<S> these crossings correspond to the crossing of @xmath80 from a double to a single peaked distribution ( see supplementing material ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we found that two point correlation functions calculated with the dynamical map always coincide with the exact ones so that @xmath82 even for this decoherence process .    for all the above cases we also checked the so - called divisibility measure @xmath83  @xcite and we found that it is zero in all of them ( see inset in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : nmdiv ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is not surprising since it can be shown that the maps arising from the total unitary evolution given by the hamiltonians in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ham1 ] ) , ( [ eq : ham2 ] ) , ( [ eq : ham3 ] ) are divisible ones . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to stress two points . </S>",
    "<S> first of all the decay case we considered offers a perfect example of a quantum system for which it is possible to find a dynamical map with the divisibility property but whose two ( and higer ) order correlation functions have a non trivial dependence upon the one point ones ( mean values ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is remarkable because this was exactly where we started from in order to define markov regimes in analogy with the classical case  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second this is another example of the discrepancy between the two most used measures of non - markovianity  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ fluctuation relations and markov regime _ - over the past thirty years the study of fluctuation relations for closed quantum systems in analogy to the classical case has been an active research area . </S>",
    "<S> different approaches have been pursued , depending on the nature of the system under study ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for brief review ) . at the heart of the problem in the quantum case is the difficulty of properly defining a quantity , which satisfies a fluctuation relation while at the same time representing the work done on the system . </S>",
    "<S> for an open quantum system the problem is even more complicated , because one has to identify the work done on the environment ( heat ) as well . </S>",
    "<S> an approach that can treat this problem successfully is to use an accompanying reference dynamics of the stationary state .    in the following we want to show that our definition of the markovian regime allows for the possibility of defining a super operator for which a fluctuation relation holds . </S>",
    "<S> we will follow the discussion in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and extend it to the case where the dynamics is not described by a lindlbad super operator  @xcite .    to this end </S>",
    "<S> we consider the liouvillian @xmath84=-\\imath[{\\hat{h}_{}^{}(t)},\\circ]$ ] , where the total hamiltonian is in general time - dependent ( external driving ) . </S>",

    "<S> the state @xmath85 is the accompanying state . </S>",
    "<S> such a stationary state is generally time dependent and we shall assume that its equation of motion is given by @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> following the discussion in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and by means of the decomposition of the correlation functions as in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : definition ] ) it is possible to show that for the mean value of any observable of the system one has @xmath89=\\text{tr}_s[{\\hat{\\pi}_{}^{}(t_0)}e^{-\\int_{t_0}^{t}d\\tau\\;\\mathcal{w}(\\tau)}{\\hat{o}_{}^{}(t)}]-\\mathcal{r(\\mathcal{q})}.\\ ] ] in the case of a gksl form @xmath90 and we recover the case discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . but </S>",
    "<S> @xmath90 would also hold for a system whose dynamics is not driven by a gksl master equation but for which eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : definition ] ) holds for any @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this result shows that it is possible to derive a fluctuation relation for the variable @xmath91 in the markov regime . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in the non - markovian regime we have @xmath92 , due to the presence of initial / dynamical correlations which are not negligible over the time scale considered .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions _ - we have presented a universal definition of non - markov regime that holds in the quantum and the classical domain . only in the markov case </S>",
    "<S> the knowledge of both , the density operator s propagator ( dynamical map ) and the initial state of the system , is enough for a _ full _ description of the system dynamics , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ for the evaluation of any @xmath0-points ( in time ) correlation functions . in the case of the quantum non - markovian dynamics </S>",
    "<S> the knowledge of the dynamical map and the initial state of the system does not allow to fully describe the reduced system dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> spontaneous emission of a two - level system exemplified our definition of the markov regime , by explicitly demonstrating that the knowledge of the exact dynamical map and the initial condition is not sufficient to describe the @xmath93-point correlation function of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the transition into a non - markov regime is induced by the build up of correlations between system and environment , which in turn are propagated during the joint evolution . once this has happened , as in the classical case  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath0-point correlation functions need to be calculated by means of @xmath0-points maps @xmath94 which , in general , are not trivially related to @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have shown that in the markov regime it is possible to define a `` work functional '' in analogy to the one introduced in ref .  </S>",
