    "in several physical systems containing a fluctuating magnetic field in a turbulent plasma , the diffusion of charged particles in the direction perpendicular to the average magnetic field has been recognized to be important .",
    "first , in the heliospheric environment , solar energetic particles associated with impulsive solar flares , or compact point - like sources , have been observed by multiple spacecraft orbiting on the heliospheric ecliptic plane , e.g. , stereo a / b , soho , widely separated in longitude ; this has been interpreted as evidence for strong cross - field diffusion @xcite .",
    "significant perpendicular diffusion has been also invoked to explain recurrent cosmic - ray variations at very high heliospheric latitudes , possibly connected with corotating interaction regions @xcite .",
    "observations of solar energetic particles at high heliographic latitude made by ulysses , have also been interpreted as evidence for cross - field diffusion @xcite .",
    "second , in non - relativistic collisionless shocks , e.g. , interplanetary shocks or supernova remnant ( snr ) shocks , the acceleration rate depends on the shock obliquity @xcite , i.e. , the angle between the magnetic field at the shock and the direction normal to the shock surface . at a perpendicular shock ,",
    "since the magnetic field lines are frozen with the plasma flow , the transport perpendicular to the magnetic field lines allows the particles to remain near the shock enhancing their acceleration .",
    "recent multiwavelength campaigns of snrs ( from radio up to @xmath0-rays ) has not yet constrained the magnetic field obliquity at the snr shock despite a burgeoning number of observational evidences of the magnetic field amplification .",
    "a single model unifying the transport in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the average magnetic field is needed to understand the propagation of energetic particles in a broad class of environments , i.e. interplanetary space , supernova remnant shocks and interstellar space ; however such a model is still missing .",
    "perpendicular diffusion has been also studied recently disentangling two different contributions : field line random walk and gradient / curvature drift of the particle guiding center from the local field line @xcite . in the limit of weak turbulence and of low ratio of particle gyroradius to the magnetic turbulence coherence length , the usual assumption of particle magnetization , i.e. , particle following field lines , is found to fail even in a simple and idealized turbulence geometry , such as the three - dimensional isotropic model .",
    "for this particular turbulence , this result must _ a fortiori _ hold for high - energy particles , because , due to larger gyroradius , high - energy particles decorrelate from the initial field line earlier than low - energy particles .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate via first - principles , using monte carlo numerical simulations , the transport of charged test particles in the direction perpendicular to the average magnetic field at early times , prior to the spatial diffusion phase .",
    "the magnetic turbulence induces a decorrelation of the particle velocity from its unperturbed evolution .",
    "the two - point particle velocity correlation function , used here indistinguishably from particle velocity autocorrelation , would be constant in time in the absence of field fluctuations .",
    "the decorrelation time , defined as the time beyond which the lorentz force experienced by the charged particle in the ambient magnetic field is uncorrelated with the force initially acting on it , depends physically on the magnetic energy density and on the ratio of the gyroradius to the turbulence correlation length . for a broad range of the parameters studied in this paper , the perpendicular particle velocity decorrelates within a few gyroperiods , i.e. , much earlier than the typical diffusion time - scale .    in the numerical experiments performed in the present paper ,",
    "we relate the time - dependence of the two - point parallel and perpendicular particle velocity correlation function to the diffusion coefficient as given by the tgk formalism @xcite .",
    "we explore the regime of strong turbulence and use a broad range for the ratio of particle gyroradius to turbulence correlation length ; our results apply both to non - relativistic and relativistic particles .",
    "our simulations confirm the exponential , or markovian , decay of the pitch - angle correlation .",
    "however , we find an unexpectedly fast decay of the perpendicular correlation , occurring within a few gyroperiods , which is not accounted for in any phenomenological transport model .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we describe previous models for the velocity autocorrelation ; in section [ nummeth ] we specify the particular turbulence model and the parameters for the test particles used in our simulations ; in section [ diffcoeff ] we summarize the results for the behaviour of diffusion coefficient at strong turbulence and high ratio of gyroradius to the turbulence correlation length ; we also show that our previous weak - turbulence model based on the separation between field line random walk and gradient / curvature drift is in agreement with our simulations ; in section [ velcorr ] we discuss our results for the pitch - angle correlation function and the perpendicular velocity autocorrelation ; in section [ astro ] we describe some astrophysical applications ; in section [ summconcl ] we summarize and conclude with the observational implications of our results ; in appendixes a and b some details of the numerical code are outlined .",
    "the investigation of the particle motion in times prior to the diffusion phase can be conveniently based on the particle velocity autocorrelation , named lagrangian as it makes use of the instantaneous particle velocity , well - defined at times as short as the early ballistic phase . moreover , the velocity autocorrelation offers the most direct approach to the long - range correlation in the so - called anomalous transport regime @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian velocity autocorrelation has not been frequently applied to particle transport for two reasons : 1 ) experimentally it is simpler to measure the eulerian velocity autocorrelation , relating two points in space separated by a fixed coordinate distance , than the lagrangian velocity autocorrelation , relating the velocity of the same physical particle at two different times ; 2 ) numerical simulations require using a large number of particles to obtain good statistics .    the random walk of charged particles in a static , i.e. , time - independent , turbulent magnetic field is commonly represented as a sequence of many stochastic events , independent of one another , i.e. , a compound poissonian process @xcite . in a magnetic turbulence , every scattering encounter has a probability of _ not _ occurring exponentially decreasing in time , since a scattering event will certainly occur as the time proceeds .",
    "an exponential decay implies that every scattering event is independent from any other and the transport is endowed with complete lack of memory ( markovian process ) .",
    "an exponential form for the autocorrelation of particle velocity @xmath1 moving in a turbulent fluid ( @xmath2 ) was first heuristically used by @xcite in a seminal discussion of the diffusion coefficient in the absence of magnetic field ; here @xmath3 has the meaning of characteristic time - scale beyond which the fluid density variations or turbulent fluid motions cause a jump of the particle velocity to a value uncorrelated with the previous value .",
    "if magnetic turbulence is included , more recent theoretical arguments led to the exponential form of the particle velocity correlation function in the direction along the average magnetic field , or , equivalently , pitch - angle correlation function @xmath4 in a static magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the exponential form of @xmath5 has been shown @xcite to correspond to the closed form for the pitch - angle coefficient diffusion in @xcite for a quasi - isotropic scattering .",
    "we briefly recall some previous approaches to the particle velocity autocorrelation to estimate the diffusion coefficients @xmath6 . in weak turbulence regime and for particle",
    "isotropically scattering in all three space directions , the pitch - angle correlation is found to decrease exponentially in time @xcite , i.e. , the scattering is markovian , with scattering time - scale @xmath7 related to the parallel mean free path ( @xmath8 ) by @xmath9 and to the parallel coefficient diffusion by @xmath10 . in the presence of strong turbulence , numerical simulations",
    "@xcite found an empirical scaling of the scattering frequency ( @xmath11 ) with the turbulence magnetic energy density .",
    "this scaling is based on two assumptions : 1 ) the motion perpendicular to the local field line , and the eventual decorrelation from the field line at high rigidity , is dominated by the turbulent scales smaller than the gyroradius ; 2 ) the decorrelation time @xmath12 is smaller than the scattering time @xmath13 . in @xcite , the scale separation in the former assumption 1 ) of @xcite",
    "is found to hold only for slab turbulence : the decorrelation from the field line is governed by the scales smaller than the correlation length , but much larger than the gyroscale ( it should be noted also that @xcite assume a negligible power in the magnetic turbulence at the gyroscale ) .",
    "in contrast , for a 3d - isotropic magnetic fluctuation , @xcite found that the decorrelation from the local field line has equal contributions from turbulent scales both larger and smaller than the correlation length .",
    "secondly , in a strong turbulence the fluctuating magnetic field transversal to the average field becomes comparable or larger than @xmath14 and the assumption 2 ) in @xcite might be violated .",
    "@xcite proposed a model ( hereafter bam model ) for the perpendicular transport of high - energy ( a few @xmath15 for typical interplanetary conditions at @xmath16 au ) charged particles based on a specific _ ansatz _ on the form of the perpendicular particle velocity autocorrelation , by supposing that particles simply move along the field lines .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite have shown that the standard quasi - linear theory @xcite provides a diffusion coefficient in the perpendicular direction larger than its numerical estimate at protons energy between @xmath16 mev and @xmath17 mev , whereas the diffusion coefficients in classical scattering theory @xcite or the bam model are too small . a more recent theory for perpendicular",
    "transport closer to numerical findings than the two forementioned models is the nlgc model @xcite . for magnetized plasma flows ,",
    "nlgc relies on an approximate relation @xcite between the eulerian and the lagrangian velocity autocorrelations .",
    "the corrsin relation assumes a diffusive nature of the particle displacement between the two points in space where the correlation is computed .",
    "however , such a diffusive assumption has been numerically found to hold only for purely hydrodynamic flows as in @xcite but not for mhd flows , as far as we are aware .",
    "moreover , the nlgc , being intrinsically diffusive , can not apply to non - diffusive magnetic turbulences geometries : different turbulence geometries are found to have different effects on the particle diffusion ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the field line random walk relies on a free parameter ( named `` a '' in @xcite ) which is not provided by any other auxiliary model and must be empirically determined from numerical simulations . within the idealized compound diffusion model , where particles are strictly tied to magnetic field lines , but scatter along them and trace back along the same field line ,",
    "the temporal evolution of the perpendicular velocity autocorrelation and the consequent diffusion coefficient have been determined analytically , confirming the expected subdiffusion @xcite .",
    "the velocity autocorrelation @xmath18 is known to be related to the symmetric part of the instantaneous diffusion tensor @xmath19 by the tgk formalism : @xmath20 .",
    "the heuristic and physically motivated bam forms of the perpendicular velocity autocorrelations at gyroperiod scale are : @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the relativistic particle gyrofrequency corresponding to the unperturbed field @xmath14 . from that assumption",
    "it follows that the perpendicular diffusion coefficients ( symmetric and anti - symmetric parts ) are @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath25 $ ] , where @xmath12 and @xmath26 are the decorrelation time - scales ( @xmath27 as assumed in the bam model ) .",
    "such a form of @xmath28 generalizes the result of @xcite down to low rigidities ( below @xmath29 gv in interplanetary medium ) .",
    "a comparison of the time - scale @xmath12 in the two forementioned works allows to relate the turbulent power at zero wavenumber to the intrinsic spatial coefficient diffusion for field line random walk . in the bam model",
    ", it turns out also that @xmath30 $ ] , which collapses to the billiard ball scattering picture @xcite if @xmath31 . in this paper",
    "we explore various regimes of the velocity autocorrelation .",
    "the result is contrasted with the bam model within broad ranges of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the particle gyroradius , @xmath35 the turbulence correlation length and @xmath36 the magnetic turbulence normalized energy density .",
    "note that the most general form of the total perpendicular coefficient of diffusion ( symmetric part ) comprises both the field line meandering part , typically dominant contribution at low - rigidity ( @xmath37 ) , and the departure from the local field line ( @xmath38 ) , due to gradient / curvature drift : @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "we estimate in this paper the correlation time for the motion perpendicular to the direction of the average field as @xmath40 , by using the numerically determined value of @xmath28 ( for the factor @xmath41 see sect .",
    "[ fldec ] ) .",
    "in a series of numerical experiments , we consider a population of charged test - particles gyrating in a magnetic field described as follows : we assume a three - dimensional magnetic field of the form @xmath42 , with an average component @xmath43 and a random component @xmath44 having a zero mean ( @xmath45 ) , and has a turbulence correlation length @xmath46 .",
    "we assume in the inertial range a scale - invariant , or kolmogorov , power - spectrum in the three space - dimensions : @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the wavenumber magnitude , @xmath49 is the one - dimensional power - law kolmogorov index and the additional @xmath50 accounts for the dimensionality of the turbulence ( for more details see appendix a ) .",
    "the assumption of a static magnetic field is reasonable if the particle speed largely exceeds the alfvn wave speed .",
    "we perform numerical integration of equations of motion of charged particles combining the code used in @xcite with the prescription for the turbulence introduced in @xcite , and widely exploited in the last two decades in various astrophysics contexts : @xcite .",
    "we determine the particle trajectory by numerically integrating the equation of motion using the lorentz force determined at the instantaneous particle position ( see appendix a for details ) .",
    "we follow particle trajectories in a three - dimensional spatially unbounded region , since particles escaped from a bounded computational domain would be removed from the simulation and could artificially modify the estimate of the instantaneous diffusion coefficient .",

    "in this paper we have performed monte - carlo simulations of test particles gyrating in a static spatially turbulent magnetic field with a three - dimensional isotropic power spectrum .",
    "first , we have computed the dependence of the diffusion coefficients in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the average magnetic field on the turbulence energy density . for weak turbulence",
    ", the prediction of our previous model for perpendicular transport based on the separation between the field line meandering and the gradient / curvature drift from the local field line is found to be in better agreement with our numerical results than the standard quasi - linear theory .",
    "for the particular power spectrum that we have considered and at fixed particle energy , the drift contribution is about one order of magnitude smaller than the contribution from field line meandering . for strong turbulence ,",

    "we have also computed the dependence of the diffusion tensor on the particle energy , specifically the ratio @xmath32 . also in this case the field - line meandering is found to be in better agreement with our numerical results than the standard quasi - linear theory .",
    "the gradient / curvature drift term turns out to be important with the increase of particle energy ; a drift - dominated diffusion can not be ruled out in different turbulent power spectra .",

    "the pitch - angle correlation drops exponentially in time for weak fluctuations , as predicted for the isotropic scattering case .",
    "we also found that for the case of strong turbulence the decay is not exponential .",
    "the deviation from the exponential decay in strong turbulence can not be accounted for by current models .",
    "the perpendicular velocity autocorrelation decays faster than an exponentially modulated oscillation predicted by previous models . even in the weak turbulence case and for gyroradius",
    "smaller than the turbulence correlation scale , no significant correlation is found beyond three gyroperiods , whereas the modulated exponential decays much slower .",
    "although in a strong turbulence the particle gyroradius can not be uniquely defined , our simulations show that the statistical effect of strong turbulence is reducing the instantaneous radius of curvature of the particle orbit ; the correlation is lost within a fraction of gyroperiod .",
    "however , for gyroradii larger than the correlation length the exponential modulation agrees with the simulations : on this scale the effect of the turbulence is not relevant and the particle pursues a quasi - helicoidal motion in a uniform field .",
    "however , for smaller gyroradii , the estimate of the decorrelation time and the magnitude shows the need of a new model .",
    "we do not provide here a phenomenological fit or analytical model for the velocity autocorrelation .",
    "our work shows that the underestimate of the diffusion coefficient previously found in the classical scattering theory can be explained in terms of lack of consistent model for the scattering and decorrelation times , and sheds light for the future investigations .",
    "a model for the diffusion coefficient based on the velocity autocorrelation needs to provide accurate description of the early - time transport , because the contributions to the diffusion beyond the gyroperiod scale average out to zero .",
