    "in the past few years , direct imaging at near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths has revealed a panoply of fine features in gaseous protoplanetary disks , thanks to the commissioning of several major high contrast , high angular resolution , adaptive optics imaging instruments onboard 8-meter class telescopes ( e.g. , subaru / hiciao , @xcite ; vlt / sphere , @xcite ; gemini / gpi , @xcite ) .",
    "these observations image starlight scattered by dust grains in disk surface layers , and they take advantage of polarized intensity ( pi ) imaging ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to achieve inner working angles as small as @xmath12 ( corresponding to @xmath114 au at the distance of taurus ) with sub-@xmath12 angular resolution .",
    "the various kinds of radial and azimuthal structures revealed promise to shed light on planet formation processes in disks .",
    "one particularly interesting discovery from nir disk imaging surveys is the large scale spiral - arm - like features identified in 2 protoplanetary disks : mwc  758 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) and sao  206462 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "the primary in both cases is a herbig star ( 1.8  @xmath13 in mwc 758 , @xcite ; and 1.6  @xmath13 in sao 206462 , @xcite ) , and both systems are recognized as transitional disks with a giant depleted central region @xcite .",
    "the 2 major arms in each system are in nearly @xmath6 rotational symmetry , and are located at tens of to @xmath1100 au from the center .",
    "the arms can be easily traced over at least 180@xmath14 in the azimuthal direction , and they are quite open with large pitch angles ( defined as the angle between the azimuthal direction and the tangent of the arm ) . besides mwc 758 and sao 206462 , spiral arms on smaller azimuthal ( and/or radial ) scale have been discovered in a number of systems , such as ab aur @xcite , hd 142527 @xcite , and hd 100546 @xcite .",
    "the number of arms in this second class of system is generally more than 5 ( with the exception of hd 100546 , which exhibits a couple of small arms ) , and the arms have an azimuthal extension generally no bigger than @xmath15 .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown that @xmath6 arms such as the pair in mwc 758 may be explained by density waves excited by one giant companion ( planet or brown dwarf ) on the periphery of the arms ( see also @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we investigate another physical mechanism that is also able to excite density waves in disks  gravitational instability ( gi ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we focus on the observational signatures of gi - induced density waves in nir imaging observations , as predicted by 3d smoothed - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) + monte carlo radiative transfer ( mcrt ) simulations .",
    "we ask specifically whether gi - induced features can resemble the observed spiral arms .",
    "this general topic has been explored by @xcite , who studied the evolution of dust in a fixed gas disk background obtained from the @xcite sph gi simulations .",
    "they calculated 2d dust surface density distributions , which were then puffed up in the vertical direction by a parametrized gaussian profile and fed into a 3d monte carlo radiative transfer ( mcrt ) code to produce synthetic images .",
    "these authors focused on relatively low mass disks , computing spatial distributions of grains with different size distributions and simulating both nir scattered light and mm - wave alma images ( see also an earlier paper by @xcite that treated gas and dust as well - mixed and that concentrated on alma observations ) . by comparison ,",
    "we will focus on nir imaging , and will explore a larger range of disk masses , making direct comparisons between models and scattered light observations of real astronomical sources .",
    "@xcite combined 2d hydro and 3d mcrt simulations to study the appearance of spiral arms at nir wavelengths in gi disks with the added complication of an embedded planet .",
    "our aim here is to isolate the effects of gi so that we can compare planet vs.  gi - based interpretations of nir images .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows .",
    "the hydro and mcrt simulations are introduced in section  [ sec : setup ] ; the modeling results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] ; and a summary and connections to observations are given in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the general workflow of our modeling is as follows .",
    "we carry out 3d global sph simulations to calculate the gas density structures of gravitationally unstable disks ( section  [ sec : hydro ] ) .",
    "the resulting models are read into the @xcite 3d dust mcrt code to produce synthetic model images at @xmath16 ( @xmath17  band , section  [ sec : mcrt ] ) , assuming that dust is uniformly mixed with gas .",
    "the vertical structure of the sph disk is iterated in the mcrt code until radiative equilibrium and hydrostatic equilibrium ( hseq ) are achieved .",
    "finally , synthetic images are convolved by a gaussian point spread function ( psf ) to achieve an angular resolution comparable to recent observations .",
    "the sph simulations are based on the code developed by @xcite , augmented by a hybrid radiative transfer formalism that combines the polytropic approximation with the flux - limited diffusion approximation @xcite to model both global cooling and radiative transfer .",
    "the opacity and temperature of the gas are calculated using an equation of state that accounts for the effects of h@xmath18 dissociation , h@xmath19 ionization , he@xmath19 and he@xmath20 ionization , ice evaporation , dust sublimation , molecular absorption , bound - free and free - free transitions and electron scattering @xcite .",
    "the simulations include heating of the disk through @xmath21d@xmath22 work and shocks ; stellar irradiation is not included .",
    "the mass of the central central star @xmath23 is assumed to be 1  @xmath13 . in total",
    "we construct 3 models ( table  [ tab : models ] ) where the disk - to - star - mass ratio @xmath0 equals @xmath24 , @xmath25 and 0.5 , respectively .",
    "each gas disk comprises @xmath26 sph particles , initially located between 10 and 60 au , and distributed in such a way that the initial surface density profile @xmath27 and the initial sound speed profile @xmath28 . by limiting the initial disk to be within 60 au",
    ", we ensure that these models remain quasi - steady , rather than fragmenting into bound companions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the accretion rate of the disks ( @xmath9 in the table ) is calculated by counting the rate at which particles accrete onto the star .",
    "all simulations are run for about 3500 years , or @xmath110 orbits at 50 au where the spiral arms are most prominent .",
    "density structures obtained in our sph simulations are post - processed using the whitney mcrt code .",
    "we construct a 3d disk in spherical coordinates , with @xmath29 cells in @xmath30 ( radial , from 5 to 100 au with logarithmic spacing to better resolve the inner disk ) , @xmath31 ( polar , from 0 to @xmath32 with power law spacing to better resolve the disk midplane at @xmath33 ) , and @xmath34 ( azimuthal , from 0 to @xmath35 with uniform spacing ) .",
    "photons from an @xmath36  @xmath37 and @xmath38  k central star ( corresponding to a @xmath39 star that is",
    "2 myr old on the hayashi track ; @xcite ) are absorbed / reemitted or scattered by dust in the surrounding disk .",
    "pre - main - sequence star ( as in the mwc 758 system ; @xcite ) in the mcrt simulations , and found that the resulting scattered light images merely brightened by a factor of @xmath14 because of the higher stellar luminosity .",
    "] the temperature in each grid cell is calculated based on the radiative equilibrium algorithm described in @xcite . the power released from accretion @xmath9 at each radius",
    "is deposited locally into the cells , and the accretion power between the magnetic truncation radius ( assumed to be at @xmath40 ) and the stellar surface is added to the total luminosity of the star .",
    "the scattering phase function is approximated using the @xcite function .",
    "polarization is calculated assuming a rayleigh - like phase function for the linear polarization @xcite .",
    "all simulations are run with 1 billion photon packets .",
    "our mcrt simulations are run with the `` hseq '' switch in the whitney code turned on . in some of our sph simulations ,",
    "the temperature in the outer disk reaches a minimum floor ( artificially set in the sph code ) that is lower than what is estimated using the mcrt calculations . as mentioned in section  [ sec : hydro ]",
    ", we do not have stellar irradiation in the sph simulations . as a result",
    ", the outer regions of our sph disks can be artificially cold , and thin in the vertical direction . to correct this effect , we readjust the vertical density distribution of the disks in the mcrt simulations using the mcrt temperature and not the sph temperature , while still using the surface density distribution from the sph simulations .",
    "this inconsistency of method is not serious ; if we were to use a higher temperature in the sph simulations , the spiral structures would be only slightly weaker than suggested here @xcite for fixed disk mass ; thus the @xmath41-values reported here are slightly underestimated .    in mcrt calculations ,",
    "the vertical structure is solved based on a self - consistent hseq condition , as gas pressure balances gravity in the vertical direction @xmath42 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is pressure , @xmath45 is density , and @xmath46 with @xmath47 equal to the total disk mass within @xmath30 .",
    "the quantities @xmath48 and @xmath45 are iterated until convergence is achieved .",
    "the dust grains in the disk are assumed to be interstellar medium ( ism ) grains @xcite made of silicate , graphite , and amorphous carbon .",
    "their size distribution is a smooth power law in the range of 0.02 - 0.25  @xmath49 followed by an exponential cut off beyond 0.25  @xmath49 .",
    "these grains are small enough to be dynamically well coupled to the gas , so that their volume density @xmath50 is linearly proportional to the gas @xmath51 ; we take the ratio to be @xmath51:@xmath50=1000:1 .",
    "the optical properties of the grains can be found in figure 2 of @xcite .",
    "full resolution synthesized pi images at @xmath17  band ( @xmath52 ) are produced from mcrt simulations , ] , or [ @xmath53 ergs  s@xmath11  @xmath54  hz@xmath11  arcsec@xmath55 . ] and then convolved by a gaussian psf with a full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath56 assuming a distance of 140  pc , to achieve an angular resolution comparable to those obtained with subaru , vlt , and gemini ( the fwhm of a theoretical airy disk is @xmath57 for a primary mirror with a diameter @xmath58  m at @xmath59 ) .",
    "the radial profiles of the surface density , midplane temperature , and toomre @xmath60 for all models are shown in figure  [ fig : hydro ] .",
    "gi develops in all cases , and manifests itself in the form of spiral density waves .",
    "disks become marginally gravitationally unstable when @xmath61 is @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the epicyclic frequency . as @xmath41 increases , the @xmath64 regime expands , from @xmath120 - 50 au in md0125 , to @xmath120 - 60 au in md025 , and to @xmath110 - 70 au in md05 .    as described in @xcite , gi disks in our models ( @xmath65 )",
    "undergo 3 phases : ( 1 ) the initial settling phase that lasts for about 500 years , during which the disk adjusts its outer radius , and material redistributes radially by axisymmetric evolution and ring formation ; ( 2 ) the ` burst ' phase that lasts for about 1000 years , during which spiral density waves form and grow ; and ( 3 ) the asymptotic phase , where gi is self - regulated and the disk reaches a quasi - equilibrium state . in the latter two phases , the dominant azimuthal wavenumber @xmath66 ( table  [ tab : models ] ) decreases as @xmath41 increases , consistent with @xcite and @xcite . in our @xmath41 range , we find @xmath3 , with the approximation becoming less accurate at low @xmath41 values ( @xmath66 does not increase as fast as @xmath67 ) .",
    "the spiral density waves have a pattern speed @xmath68 , listed in table  [ tab : models ] along with the corresponding corotation radius @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) . in general , the spirals are roughly in keplerian rotation , and @xmath69 coincides with the main part of the arms .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite , who found for a @xmath71 disk that @xmath68 differs from the local @xmath72 by @xmath73 .",
    "this property should lead to dust trapping by the arms and promote grain growth and planetesimal formation . as shown by @xcite and @xcite , dust particles with stokes number @xmath11",
    "tend to be trapped at local pressure maxima in disks ; this has been demonstrated both in radial ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and azimuthal gas structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a mechanism to explain observed concentrations of dust particles in alma disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of spiral arms",
    ", @xcite have shown that for @xmath74 , spiral density waves can act to trap dust particles , and through 2d shearing box simulations , @xcite concluded that the local dust surface density can be enhanced by up to @xmath75 orders of magnitude relative to the gas .",
    "the surface density and synthetic @xmath17 band images are shown in figure  [ fig : image ] , and the radial as well as azimuthal profiles of the convolved images are shown in figure  [ fig : profile ] . in @xmath76 ,",
    "spiral density waves are clearly present in all cases , while their amplitudes increase from a factor of @xmath11.5 in md0125 to a factor of @xmath13 in md05 ( @xmath77 in table  [ tab : models ] ) . in the convolved images , only md025 and",
    "md05 show prominent spiral patterns , while the arms in md0125 are weak and hard to distinguish from the background .",
    "in particular , the md05 model shows a pair of grand - design @xmath6 arms , with a morphology very similar to the pair in the mwc 758 system .",
    "the contrast of the arms to the background ( @xmath78 in table  [ tab : models ] ) ranges from a factor of @xmath12 in md025 to a factor of @xmath13 in md05 . note that our arm contrast in convolved images should be taken as upper limits , as realistic instrumental effects such as flux loss and observational noise , which may affect both the absolute and relative fluxes , are not included in the production of our model images ( beyond the intrinsic monte carlo noise in the radiative transfer images ) .",
    "the pitch angle of the arms ( table  [ tab : models ] ) increases from @xmath79 in md0125 to @xmath80 in md05 , values that are consistent with those characterizing the sao 206462 and mwc 758 systems @xcite .",
    "we studied the observational signatures of gi - induced spiral arms in direct imaging observations at nir wavelengths with 3d sph calculations and 3d mcrt simulations .",
    "our main conclusions are :    1 .   gravitational instability can produce prominent spiral arms in nir scattered light images when @xmath81 .",
    "their morphologies ( see figure [ fig : comparison ] ) resemble strongly the ones discovered in recent observations ( e.g. , sao 206462 as imaged by @xcite , and most strikingly , the pair of @xmath6 arms in mwc 758 found by @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath82 , gi - induced spiral arms are small in size and weak in scattered light images , with contrasts @xmath83 .",
    "they may be difficult to detect with the current angular resolution of nir observations .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite .",
    "the dominant azimuthal wavenumber of gi - induced spiral arms is @xmath3 in the range of @xmath4 .",
    "the spiral arms have a pattern speed that roughly agrees with the keplerian speed at where the arms are .",
    "dust trapping by arms at local pressure maxima may therefore be possible .",
    "although qualitatively our @xmath84 and @xmath74 model images show good agreement with the mwc 758 and sao 206462 observed images ( figure  [ fig : comparison ] ) , whether gi is actually at work in these two systems is unclear .",
    "there are at least 3 potential issues that need to be addressed to validate gi as a possible explanation for these systems :    1 .",
    "our set of 3 models shows that @xmath41 has to be @xmath85 for the spiral density waves to be prominent in scattered light images as seen in observations ( in particular , grand - design @xmath6 arms require @xmath5 )",
    ". however , under conventional assumptions for dust opacity and dust - to - gas - mass ratio , @xcite estimated the disk mass @xmath86 of these 2 systems using mm continuum observations , and concluded that @xmath41 is on the order of 1% in both cases .",
    "the caveat , of course , is that the conventional assumptions for dust opacity and dust - to - gas - mass ratio may not be correct , and @xmath86 may have been underestimated , at least in some cases .",
    "see our discussion on the hl tau system below . on the other hand , disks with @xmath8",
    "may develop substantial non - keplerian velocity components , the detections of which will help determine the masses of these systems @xcite .",
    "2 .   the measured stellar mass accretion rates of the 2 systems are both on the order of @xmath87 yr@xmath11 @xcite , about 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the @xmath9 s from our models md025 and md05 .",
    "the caveat here is that accretion in gi disks can be highly episodic . as shown in @xcite ( their figure  3 ) , although the time - averaged @xmath9 can reach @xmath88 yr@xmath11 , @xmath9 fluctuates with large amplitude and can occasionally dip under @xmath87 yr@xmath11 .",
    "while the spiral arms in sao 206462 are located at @xmath13080 au from the star , consistent with our models , the @xmath6 arms in mwc 758 extend to @xmath1135  au , which is formally outside the region that we simulate ( mwc 758 is 280 pc away , @xcite ; sao 206462 is 140 pc away , @xcite ; our model distances are 140 pc ) .",
    "gi disks tend to fragment outside a critical radius @xmath89 if the opacity has the form of @xmath90 , as expected from the ice - grain - dominated opacity at low temperatures @xcite . both theoretical estimates @xcite and some numerical simulations ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ) have suggested @xmath89 to be around @xmath1100  au ( but see also figure 2 in @xcite and figure 1 in @xcite , showing spiral arms but no fragments at several hundred au ) .",
    "the radial scale of mwc  758 s arms appear dangerously close to , if not exceeding , the fragmentation radius .",
    "we conclude from the above three concerns that it is unclear whether the major spiral arm systems discovered so far from direct nir imaging surveys can be attributed to gi .",
    "planets , as shown by @xcite , represent a more plausible explanation . nevertheless , if future nir imaging observations find prominent spiral arms in disks ( 1 ) with large masses ( @xmath91 ) , ( 2 ) with high stellar accretion rates ( @xmath92 yr@xmath11 ) , and ( 3 ) on relatively compact scales ( @xmath7 100  au , safely inside the gravitational fragmentation radius ) , then gi would be securely implicated .",
    "once such systems are found , the number of spirals in the disk , i.e. , the dominant azimuthal wavenumber , will be a good diagnostic of the disk s total mass .",
    "we close with a few remarks on the hl tau system . with a high accretion rate ( @xmath93 yr@xmath11 , @xcite ) and total gas disk mass estimated from mm continuum observations ( @xmath94 , @xcite )",
    ", the hl tau system should be prone to gravitational instability , as suggested by our model md025 , and prominent low @xmath66-mode spiral arms are expected to form .",
    "this picture seems to be incompatible with the alma observations @xcite that reveal concentric rings , likely created by planets @xcite .",
    "the lack of spirals may suggest that previous estimates of hl tau s disk mass are too high and/or that the stellar mass estimate is too low .",
