    "it is well known that observations of thermal radiation from cooling ( isolated ) neutron stars and from accreting neutron stars in quiescent states of x - ray transients ( xrts ) can be used to infer ( constrain ) parameters of neutron stars and explore properties of superdense matter in their interiors ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this can be done by modeling thermal states and evolution of isolated and transiently accreting neutron stars and by comparing theoretical models with observations .    in this way",
    "one can test various model equations of state ( eoss ) of superdense matter in neutron star cores  whether these eoss are consistent with the data or not .",
    "direct numerical modeling for the different eoss and masses of neutron stars is often time consuming and requires complicated computer codes .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to simplify the task by obtaining analytic approximations for basic integral properties of neutron stars which determine their thermal evolution .",
    "specifically , we consider thermally relaxed neutron stars which are isothermal inside ( e.g. @xcite ) . taking into account the effects of general relativity",
    ", they should possess spacially constant redshifted internal temperature @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a local temperature of the matter and @xmath2 is the metric function which determines gravitational redshift .",
    "a noticeable temperature gradient persists only in a thin outer ( heat blanketing ) envelope with a rather poor thermal conductivity ; its thickness does not exceed a few hundred meters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we will study redshifted integrated neutrino luminosities @xmath3 and heat capacities @xmath4 of such stars which are the main ingredients for simulating their thermal structure and evolution .",
    "these quantities are mainly determined by bulky and massive neutron star cores and depend on @xmath5 .",
    "they depend also on the eos of neutron star matter and on the stellar mass @xmath6 .",
    "the neutrino luminosity @xmath3 is the sum of the luminosities provided by different neutrino emission mechanisms .",
    "both quantities , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , can be strongly affected by superfluidity in the neutron star cores .",
    "we study a wide class of eoss of neutron star cores composed of neutrons , protons , electrons and muons . these eoss may open or forbid the powerful direct urca processes of neutrino emission in neutron star cores @xcite .",
    "we consider either non - superfluid ( normal ) cores or the cores with strong proton superfluidity which suppresses all neutrino processes involving protons as well as the proton heat capacity in the core ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ". we will calculate @xmath3 and @xmath7 and approximate them by analytic expressions which are universal for all chosen eoss .",
    "this universality greatly simplifies theoretical analysis of observational data on cooling isolated and transiently accreting neutron stars . for illustration",
    ", we give a sketch of such an analysis for quasi - stationary neutron stars in xrts . in our analysis",
    "we neglect possible effects of magnetic fields .",
    "let us outline the main elements of the cooling theory of neutron stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) . during the first @xmath8  yr after their birth neutron stars cool mostly via neutrino emission from their interiors . during an initial cooling period @xmath9  yr",
    "the internal regions of the star become isothermal . since then neutrinos are mainly generated in the stellar core .",
    "the basic neutrino emission mechanisms in the core are the _ direct urca _",
    "( du ) and _ modified urca _",
    "( mu ) processes as well as _ neutrino - pair bremsstrahlung in baryon collisions_. neutrino emissivities of these processes strongly depend on the properties of the matter  on composition and superfluidity of baryons ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we assume that the neutron star core consists of neutrons with some admixtures of protons , electrons and muons ( @xmath10-matter ) in beta equilibrium .",
    "the neutrino emissivities of relevant processes are reviewed , for instance , by @xcite .",
    "we will study the case of fully non - superfluid ( non - sf ) matter and the case of strongly superfluid ( sf ) protons with other particles being in normal states .",
    "the first case refers to the standard neutrino emission level and describes the so called standard neutrino candles .",
    "the main contribution to the luminosity of the neutron star core comes from the du or mu processes . for the mu process",
    ", we have @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the number densities of neutrons , protons , electrons and muons , respectively ; @xmath16  @xmath17 is the standard number density of nucleons in saturated nuclear matter , @xmath18 is a local temperature expressed in @xmath19  k and @xmath20 is a dimensionless factor to account for different branches of the process ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this work",
    "we need only the main dependence @xmath21 .",
    "the factor @xmath22  erg  @xmath23  s@xmath24 is calculated under the assumptions described by @xcite , with an effective masses of protons and neutrons @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .    for the du process",
    ", we have ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath27 where @xmath28  erg  @xmath23  s@xmath24 , while the factors @xmath29 and @xmath30 are equal to @xmath31 ( open the electron and muon processes , respectively ) if fermi momenta of reacting particles satisfy the triangle condition ; otherwise , these factors are zero . because of the triangle conditions , the electron and muon du processes have thresholds and can operate only in the central regions of massive neutron stars . for some eoss , they do not operate at all .",
    "the sf case corresponds to the most slowly cooling neutron stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where all neutrino reactions involving protons are strongly suppressed by proton superfluidity and the most efficient neutrino emission is provided by the nn - bremsstrahlung . then ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath32 where @xmath33  erg  @xmath23  s@xmath24 .",
    "another quantity important for cooling neutron stars is the specific heat of the neutron core @xmath34 .",
    "since neutron stars are mainly composed of strongly degenerate particles , the heat capacities at constant volume and pressure are almost identical and we do not discriminate between them . in the non - sf case",
    "there are four contributions to the specific heat in a nucleon neutron star core , @xmath35 for @xmath36 one has @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the boltzmann constant while @xmath39 and @xmath40 are , respectively , the effective mass and the fermi momentum of particles @xmath41 . note that the main contributions to @xmath42 comes from @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "taking @xmath45 and @xmath46 , we obtain @xmath47 with @xmath48 n or p , and @xmath49  erg  @xmath23  k@xmath24 . in the case of very strong",
    "proton superfluidity one has @xmath50 .",
    "integration of @xmath51 and @xmath52 over the neutron star core gives the neutrino luminosity @xmath53 and the heat capacity @xmath54 of the core .",
    "the same quantities for the crust are negligible after the star reaches the state of internal thermal relaxation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if so , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are almost equal to the total neutrino luminosity and heat capacity of the star , respectively .",
    "we will perform the integration of @xmath51 and @xmath55 for different eoss in the core assuming isothermal interior of the star .",
    ".[tab : eosparams ] the basic parameters of stars with the selected eoss ; @xmath56 and @xmath57 refer to most massive stable stars ; @xmath58 and @xmath59 refer to stars where the du process becomes allowed . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         the approximations ( [ eq : lc - final ] ) and ( [ eq : xrtbalance ] ) greatly simplify an analysis of thermal states of neutron stars in xrts .",
    "now we need only mass @xmath6 , radius @xmath60 , the neutrino emission scenario and the heat blanketing envelope type to calculate an @xmath61 relation .    the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : doublefigure ] shows six families of @xmath62 curves for a fixed time - averaged mass accretion rate @xmath63  m@xmath64  yr@xmath24 .",
    "the families are for the three scenarios of neutrino emission ( nn , mu , du ) and the two limiting models of neutron star heat blanketing envelopes ( fe and acc ) .",
    "the curves of different types are calculated from ( [ eq : lgammainf - mdot_final ] ) for the different eoss ( table [ tab : eosparams ] ) using the appropriate @xmath65 relations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m - r ] ) .",
    "the six horizontal shaded bands enclose the curves of these six families .",
    "recall that the du curves are plotted only at @xmath66  m@xmath67 , moreover , even at @xmath68  m@xmath67 the du curves are only underestimations of @xmath61 relations , as our approximations overestimate @xmath69 .",
    "the presented bands can be treated as overestimated photon thermal luminosity bands for the du curves . for each band",
    ", the bounding stellar models are chosen as @xmath70  m@xmath64 , @xmath71  km ( sly ; lower bound ) and @xmath72  m@xmath64 , @xmath73  km ( nl3@xmath74 ; upper bound ) .",
    "note that the @xmath62 relations are mostly non - monotonic .",
    "the luminosity increases with growing @xmath6 for low - mass stars but then decreases again for massive stars ; the lowest @xmath6 does not necessarily correspond to the brightest source in the band .",
    "this is a consequence of general relativity effects .",
    "the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : doublefigure ] shows the same six bands as on the left - hand panel , but in the @xmath61 plane .",
    "thin curves present numerical solutions of the initial equation ( [ eq : xrtbalance ] ) ( without assuming @xmath75 ) for the bounding neutron star models ( see above ) .",
    "such solutions almost coincide with the approximate ones if @xmath76 .",
    "we stress that fig .",
    "[ fig : doublefigure ] illustrates only six representative scenarios of thermal states of neutron stars .",
    "any filled band limits possible values of @xmath77 versus @xmath6 or @xmath78 for neutron stars with the selected eoss .",
    "although the set of these eoss is restricted we expect that the bands are robust ( should not be greatly changed for a wider class of eoss of nucleon matter ) .",
    "another important feature is that the direct effect of the eos on thermal states of neutron stars in xrts for any of the six scenarios does not seem very strong .",
    "therefore , the analysis of these scenarios is relatively model - independent .",
    "note also that the thin theoretical curves are valid only at @xmath79  m@xmath67  yr@xmath24 . at higher accretion rates the internal thermal equilibrium of the neutron star is violated .",
    "this leads to higher @xmath80 than predicted by isothermal calculations .",
    "the theoretical bands on the right - hand panel of fig.[fig : doublefigure ] are compared with observational data ( or observational upper limits shown by arrows ) for 24 sources .",
    "the data are the same as those presented by @xcite ( who gave also the list of original publications ) .",
    "the sources are numbered in accordance with table [ tab : xrts ] .",
    "they are mainly located between the mu and du - cooling bands .",
    "note the absence of any source with measured @xmath81  m@xmath67  yr@xmath24 except for 4u  2129 + 47 ( source 6 ) and ks  1731260 ( source 10 ) , for which only @xmath78 upper limits are given .    the thick solid black line on the right - hand panel of fig .  [ fig : doublefigure ] corresponds to @xmath82 ( for non - redshifted quantities , @xmath83 ) .",
    "it is the absolute upper bound on the thermal quiescent luminosity of a neutron star in the deep crustal heating scenario .",
    "one can see that all the data satisfy this upper bound . actually , the data agree also with the highest ` nn acc ' band and even with lower ` mu acc ' or ` nn iron ' bands , but disagree with the ` mu iron ' band .",
    "this means that all the hottest neutron stars observed in quescent states of xrts can not be explained by the standard mu neutrino cooling and the standard iron envelopes .",
    "one needs either a slower ( nn ) neutrino cooling ( strong sf ) and/or accreted envelopes to raise @xmath77 and explain the data .",
    "the possibility of raising @xmath77 by strong sf has been analysed earlier ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    while the direct effects of eos on thermal states of neutron stars in xrts are not strong , other factors are seen ( fig .",
    "[ fig : doublefigure ] ) to affect these thermal states much stronger .",
    "for instance , fixing the neutrino emission scenario ( nn , mu or du ) but varying chemical composition of the heat blanketing envelope from pure iron to pure accreted can produce much stronger variations of @xmath77 ( much wider bands ) than those due to the eoss .",
    "alternatively , fixing the envelope composition ( fe or acc ) and varying the neutrino emission scenarios ( from nn to mu by proton superfluidity and to du either by superfluidity or by nuclear physics effects , which shift @xmath84 ) , one can produce even stronger variations of @xmath77 .",
    "recall that in the strong neutrino emission ( du ) scenario we have artificially extended the operation of the du process over the entire neutron star core overestimating @xmath85 in massive stars .",
    "accordingly , our du bands in fig .  [ fig : doublefigure ] appear to be downshfted by a factor of few with respect to the heating curves calculated in the previous analyses ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , one should be careful in using our du bands for analysing thermal states of the coldest sources , 1h  1905 + 000 @xcite and sax  j1808.43658 @xcite as massive neutron stars with the du process on .",
    "these sources are very important for proving ( or disproving ) the operation of the du process in massive stars .",
    "the real du bands should lie by a factor of @xmath86 higher ( in natural scale ) .",
    "however , we believe that our current du bands have realistic widths and reasonably well describe variations of @xmath77 due to composition of the envelopes . we expect to improve our model - independent analysis of the du bands in our future publication .",
    "we have considered a representative set of seven eoss for neutron stars with nucleon cores ( table  [ tab : eosparams ] ) and analysed the models of neutron stars with isothermal interiors ( with constant redshifted internal temperatures @xmath5 ) .",
    "we have calculated the neutrino luminosities @xmath3 and heat capacities @xmath54 of the cores of these stars with masses @xmath87 for several important scenarios of neutron star internal structure .",
    "the quantities @xmath3 and @xmath54 almost coincide with the total neutrino luminosities and heat capacities of neutron stars .",
    "specifically , we have studied the three scenarios for @xmath3 which correspond to ( i ) the neutrino - pair bremsstrahlung in nn collisions ( owing to the presence of strong proton superfluidity in the core ) ; ( ii ) non - sf stars which cool via mu processes ; ( iii ) non - sf stars cooling via powerful du processes .",
    "we have considered the two scenarios for @xmath54 , relevant for non - sf cores and the cores with strong proton superfluidity .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath3 and @xmath54 have been accurately fitted by the analytic expressions ( [ eq : lc - final ] ) which are universal for all selected eoss .",
    "the fit parameters ( table  [ tab : npkabcgamma ] ) are almost independent of the specific eos . we expect that @xmath3 and @xmath54 calculated for neutron stars with other eoss of nucleon matter would be similar and could be approximated in the same way making our approximations almost model independent .    in this sense",
    "our consideration extends model - independent analysis of cooling neutron stars based on the standard neutrino cooling function @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived also model - independent approximations to the neutrino cooling function @xmath89 for stars with strong proton superfluidity . @xcite performed a more complicated model - independent analysis of the cooling enhanced by the onset of triplet - state pairing of neutrons and associated neutrino emission in neutron star cores .",
    "our present results are more refined because we analyse a weak dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath54 on the eos . our approximations of @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath54 greatly simplify calculations of cooling of isolated neutron stars at the neutrino cooling stage after the initial thermal relaxation ( @xmath90 yr ) .",
    "this cooling is governed by the neutrino cooling function @xmath91 .",
    "the expressions for @xmath92 obtained from our fits of @xmath3 and @xmath54 are in good agreement with the approximations used in @xcite but ours seem more complete .",
    "the approximations of @xmath54 should simplify cooling simulations of isolated neutron stars at the photon cooling stage ( at @xmath93 yr , when the neutrino luminosity @xmath3 becomes unimportant ) .",
    "finally , the approximations we obtained for @xmath3 simplify considerations of thermal states of accreting neutron stars in quasi - stationary xrts as demonstrated in section [ sec : xrts ] .",
    "let us stress that our results are far from being perfect because they are obtained under a number of simplified assumptions . for instance , while constructing the approximations we have assumed the ratio @xmath94 to be constant .",
    "in fact , it slightly decreases with the growth of @xmath6 .",
    "it may be so that one can improve our fits taking into account the approximations of @xmath95 by @xcite .    while approximating @xmath96 we have assumed that the du process is open in the entire core .",
    "in fact , it can operate in a small central kernel .",
    "the size of this kernel depends on @xmath6 and the eos model .",
    "its radius is zero at @xmath97 but increases with growing @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , according to table  [ tab : eosparams ] , for three of the seven selected eoss the du process is forbidden in all stable neutron star models .",
    "thus , our approximation of @xmath96 can be treated as an overestimation to be improved in the future .",
    "we have considered superfluidity of nucleons in a simplified manner , i.e. we have assumed that neutrons are totally non - superfluid but protons are either totally non - superfluid or fully superfluid .",
    "the advantages and disadvantages of such a treatment are discussed by @xcite .",
    "another simplification of our approach is in using constant effective nucleon masses equal to 0.7 of their bare masses .",
    "in addition , the neutrino emissivities have been calculated employing approximate squared matrix elements of neutrino reactions taken by @xcite from calculations by @xcite .",
    "we expect that we can include a more advanced physics using a similar formalism when this physics appears for a number of representative eoss .",
