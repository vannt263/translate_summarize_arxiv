    "quantum finite automata ( qfa ) , as theoretical models for quantum computers with finite memory , have been explored by many researchers .",
    "so far , a variety of models of qfa have been introduced and explored to various degrees ( one can refer to a review article @xcite and references therein ) . among these qfa , there is a class of qfa that differ from others by consisting of two interactive components : a quantum component and a classical one .",
    "we call them _ semi - quantum automata _ in this paper",
    ". examples of semi - quantum automata are _ one - way qfa with control language _ ( cl-1qfa )",
    "@xcite , _ one - way qfa together with classical states _",
    "( 1qfac ) @xcite , and _ one - way finite automata with quantum and classical states _",
    "( 1qcfa ) @xcite . here",
    "`` one - way '' means that the automaton s tape head is required to move right on scanning each tape cell .",
    "these semi - quantum automata have been proved to not only recognize all regular languages , but also show superiority over dfa with respect to descriptional power .",
    "for example , 1qcfa , cl-1qfa and 1qfac were all shown to be much smaller than dfa in accepting some languages ( resolving some promise problems ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , a lower bound on the size of 1qfac was given in @xcite , which stated that 1qfac can be at most exponentially more concise than dfa , and the bound was shown to be tight by giving some languages witnessing this exponential gap .",
    "size lower bounds were also reported for cl-1qfa in @xcite and for 1qcfa in @xcite ( no detailed proof was given in @xcite for the bound of 1qcfa ) , but they were not proved to be tight . by the way , we mention that the result obtained in @xcite that 1qfca recognize only regular languages follows directly from @xcite , although a relatively complex procedure was used in @xcite to deduce this result .    specially , one can see that complex technical treatments were used in @xcite to derive the bound for cl-1qfa and one may find that some key steps in @xcite were confused such that the proof there may have some flaws , which will be explained more clearly in section 4 .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the method used in @xcite is tailored for cl-1qfa and is not easy to adopt to other models .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask : is there a uniform and simple method giving lower bounds on the size of the above three semi - quantum automata ? this is possible , as 1qcfa , cl-1qfa and 1qfac have the similar structure as shown in @xcite , where they were described in a uniform way : a semi - quantum automaton can be seen as a two - component communication systems comprising a quantum component and a classical one , and they differ from each other mainly in the specific communication pattern : classical - quantum , or quantum - classical , or two - way .",
    "it was also proved in @xcite that the three models can be simulated by the model of qfa with mixed states and trace - preserving quantum operations(referred as mo-1gqfa ) @xcite .    in this paper , by using the above result",
    ", we present a uniform method that gives a lower bound on the size of 1qcfa , cl-1qfa and 1qfac , and this lower bound shows that they can be at most exponentially more concise than dfa .",
    "specifically , we first obtain a lower bound on the size of mo-1gqfa and then apply it to the three hybrid models by using the relationship between them and mo-1gqfa . compared with a recent work @xcite",
    ", our method is much more concise and universal , and it can be applied to the three existing main models of semi - quantum automata .",
    "in addition , our method may fix a potential mistake in @xcite that will be indicated later on .",
    "throughout this paper , for matrix ( operator ) @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the conjugate and conjugate - transpose of @xmath0 , respectively , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the trace and rank of @xmath0 , respectively . according to von neumann s formalism of quantum mechanics , a quantum system is associated with a hilbert space which is called the state space of the system . in this paper , we only consider finite dimensional spaces .",
    "a ( mixed ) state of a quantum system is represented by a density operator on its state space . here a density operator @xmath5 on @xmath6 is a positive semi - definite linear operator such that @xmath7 .",

    "let @xmath11 and @xmath12 be the sets of linear operators and density operators on @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "a trace - preserving quantum operation @xmath13 on state space @xmath6 is a linear map from @xmath14 to itself that has an _ operator - sum representation _ as @xmath15 with the completeness condition @xmath16 , where @xmath17 are called operation elements of @xmath13 .    a general measurement is described by a collection @xmath18 of measurement operators , where the index @xmath19 refers to the potential measurement outcome , satisfying the condition @xmath20 if this measurement is performed on a state @xmath5 , then the classical outcome @xmath19 is obtained with the probability @xmath21 , and the post - measurement state is @xmath22 for the case that @xmath5 is a pure state @xmath23 , that is , @xmath24 , we have @xmath25 and the state @xmath23 `` collapses '' into the state @xmath26    a special case of general measurements is the projective measurement @xmath27 where @xmath28 s are orthogonal projectors .",

    "for example , we have @xmath53    if we let @xmath54 be an @xmath55-dimensional column vector with the @xmath56th entry being 1 and else 0 s , then @xmath57 form a basis of @xmath58 .",

    ", we focus on automata with a one - way tape head , that is , after scanning an input symbol the model moves its tape head one cell right .        as shown in @xcite ,",

    "( cl-1qfa)@xcite , defined as follows .    a cl-1qfa is a 7-tuple @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a finite set of quantum basis states , @xmath75 is a finite alphabet , @xmath76 is a finite set of symbols ( measurement outcomes ) , @xmath77 is the initial quantum state , @xmath78 is a unitary operator for each @xmath79 , @xmath80 is a projective measurement given by a collection @xmath81 of projectors , and @xmath82 is a regular language ( called a control language).[df : cl - qfa ]    in cl-1qfa @xmath83 , on scanning a symbol @xmath42 , a unitary operator @xmath78 followed by the projective measurement @xmath80 is performed on its current state . thus , given an input string @xmath84 , the computation produces a sequence @xmath85 of measurement results with a certain probability @xmath86 that is given by @xmath87 where we define the ordered product @xmath88 .",
    "the input @xmath89 is said to be _ accepted _ if @xmath90 belongs to a fixed regular language @xmath91 .",

    "note that in this paper the notion of 1qcfa is slightly more general than the one in @xcite .",
    "the reason for why we adopt the current definition is that it has a more succinct form which simplifies some notations ( for example , in our version we need give only the set of general measurements , instead of two sets : unitary operators and projective measurements ) .",
    "it is , however , worthwhile to emphasize that all results obtained in this paper hold surely for the model in @xcite .",
