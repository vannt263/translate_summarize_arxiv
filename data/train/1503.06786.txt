    "in recent years metamaterials have aroused great attention as a tool for achieving desired electromagnetic properties , which might not exist in nature [ - ] . among them",
    "a special attention has been paid to all - dielectric metamaterials [ - ] , which do not suffer from the ohmic losses contrary to the metal - based ones .",
    "all - dielectric metamaterials with various constitutive units , such as spheres [ ] , cubes [ ] and rods [ , ] , were shown to exhibit the negative magentic permeability as well as negative [ - ] and zero refractive index [ ] .",
    "silicon nanodimers , exhibiting both electric and magnetic dipole responses , have recently been experimentally demonstrated to enhance electric and magnetic fields in the optical range [ ] .",
    "high permittivity dielectric rings are of particular interest , because they possess a strong broadband magnetic response [ - ] .",
    "in addition , they have more degrees of freedom for tuning the resonance frequency by geometrical parameters than , for example , spheres , cubes or cylinders . furthermore , they exhibit resonances on the thz frequencies [ - ] , a very promising range for emerging applications .",
    "being as the most frequent appearence periodical structures composed of subwavelength elements ( the metamaterial lattice constant is on the order of @xmath1 ) , three dimensional metamaterials are often treated as continuous media ( the procedure referred to as _ homogenization _ ) , described by some effective parameters , e.g. permittivity @xmath2 , permeability @xmath3 , refractive index @xmath4 and impedance @xmath5 , that simplifies their description .",
    "various methods of homogenization have been suggested based on , for instance , field averaging , single - interface scattering , non - local dielectric function and other approaches ( see the brief overview of the methods in [ ] ) . the most popular practical way of retrieving the effective parameters remains the nicolson - ross - weir ( nrw ) or s - parameters method based on inversion of formulas for fresnel s reflection and transmission coefficients .",
    "it was originally proposed for conventional media [ ] and then extended to metamaterials [ ] .",
    "the nrw method was accused of the loss of the retrieved effective parameters physical meaning , since they do not satisfy the locality principle [ - ] and presence of the so - called `` anti - resonance '' [ ] ( non - physical for passive materials im@xmath6 and im@xmath7 ; we assume optical exponential convention @xmath8 ) . moreover ,",
    "introduction of bulk effective parameters to metasurfaces or few layers metamaterials is questionable .",
    "obviously the properties of a single layer or a layer with only few neighbors can be substantially different from the properties of a layer with many neighbors . in some cases of strong interaction between meta - atoms",
    "it is not possible to introduce any meaningful effective parameters [ ] .",
    "we use another approach in which meta - atoms are replaced with point electric and magnetic dipoles [ , , - ] .",
    "the advantage of such approach is that the interaction of dipoles can be explicitly taken into account either numerically for the arrays up to few hundreds by few hundreds elements or analytically for an infinite array [ ] .",
    "however , the applicability of the point dipoles approximation to all - dielectric metamaterials has not been verified yet . in order to achieve strong resonant features , high refractive index dielectrics",
    "are typically used , and thus even geometrically subwavelength meta - atoms may become electrically ( optically ) larger than a wavelength exhibiting rapid field variations within their volume .    the goal of this work is to verify the applicability of the electric and magnetic dipole approximation for description of all - dielectric metamaterials .",
    "we make the study on the example of dielectric ring metamaterials .",
    "we start with considering a single layer of meta - atoms and investigate the dependence of their electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the geometrical parameters .",
    "then in order to figure out the limits of the dipole approximation we show how the retrieved polarizabilities depend on the metamaterial lattice constant .",
    "finally we consider a few layers of dielectric rings and compare the analytical predictions for reflectance @xmath9 with the full - wave numerical simulations .",

    "the equivalent dipoles are positioned in the center of the rings .",
    "the electric @xmath21 and magnetic @xmath22 dipole moments are induced by the external field ( amplitude of the electric and magnetic field are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 $ ] is the free - space impedance ) as well as by all the neighbors within the infinite array ( interaction field @xmath27 ) . in the case of a single layer , taking into account the identity of the dipoles , we express @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xmath28    where the interaction constant @xmath29 is @xmath30+i\\left(\\frac{kd}{2}-\\frac{k^3d^3}{6\\pi}\\right),\\ ] ] and @xmath31=d/1.438 [ ] .",
    "the amplitude reflection and transmission coefficients can be split into electric @xmath32 and magnetic @xmath33 terms [ ] : @xmath34 the polarizabilities of the particles are then expressed as @xmath35    we introduce the normalized dimensionless polarizabilities @xmath36 , @xmath37 . then the inverse polarizabilities are @xmath38    considering two layers of particles one should take into account the interaction between the layers .",

    "the resonant peaks and dips are clearly seen in the reflectance spectra , for example , follow the blue line in fig . [ fig:2](a ) .",
    "they correspond to the lower - order modes of the dielectric ring resonators , namely , the magnetic dipolar ( lower frequency ) and electric dipolar ( higher frequency ) modes .",

    "the influence of the infinite number of neighbors is taken into account through interaction constant @xmath29 , for which accurate analytical formulas exist for the square array of point dipoles [ ] . at the same time , the rings we consider here are not point - like , but rather comparable to the period of the array .",
    "this may lead to both deviation of the field distribution of a certain dipole from the field of the dipole located in its center ( thus , influence on polarizabilities @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) as well as on the interaction field of all other dipoles ( thus , influence on interaction constant @xmath29 ) .",
    "we assume that interaction constant @xmath29 is the same as given by formula ( 7 ) , and thus all effects related to the finite size of the rings are included into retrieved polarizabilities @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "then , retrieving the polarizabilities for the arrays of various periods we are able to characterize how different from the point dipoles the meta - atoms are ( ideally the retrieved polarizabilities should not depend on the array period ) .",
    "we call the actual period of the structure @xmath63 in order to differ it from the previously used constant @xmath13 , while the latter is now used for normalization of frequency and polarizabilities only",
    ".    period @xmath63 influences the restored electric and magnetic polarizabilities ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) and they converge to a certain value with increasing period @xmath63 . such behavior is natural , since the larger the period the smaller is the radius - to - period ratio @xmath64 and , thus , the accuracy of the dipole approximation improves .",
    "generally convergence of magnetic polarizabilities @xmath62 [ fig .",
    "[ fig:4](a)-(d ) ] is faster than electric @xmath61 [ fig . [ fig:4](a)-(d ) ] what can mean that magnetic interaction of the rings is weaker than electric . in case of touching rings ( @xmath65 )",
    "the retrieved polarizabilities differ much from the asymptotic value , clearly exhibiting failure of the point dipoles approximation .",
    "indeed , touching rings can hardly be considered as a set of separate rings , but rather as a periodic subwavelength grating or a perforated dielectric membrane .",

    "overall we may conclude that dipole approximation is consistent for the rings radius up to @xmath59 and lattice constant @xmath70 .          knowing",
    "polarizabilities @xmath61 and @xmath62 of individual rings retrieved from the simulated reflection and transmission for a single layer , we may analytically predict the reflection and transmission for several layers of rings ( see the methodology section for details ) .",
    "direct comparison of these analytical predictions to numerical simulations can give us additional evidences of applicability or non - applicability of the point dipoles approximation .",
    "we use the same rings geometrical parameters as in the previous subsection .",

    "[ fig:5](d ) ] the reflections given with two methods do not resemble each other reasonably , especially in the region of resonant peaks and dips .",
    "interestingly , the reflection is different not only in the region of polarizabilities resonances ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) , but also in other regions of reflection dips which we interpret as appeared due to fabry - perot resonances ( increasing @xmath10 leads to the high - dielectric materials filling fraction increase and thus to the increase of the overall optical thickness of the metamaterial slab ) .",

    "even though the period of the grating is smaller than the free - space wavelength , and thus no diffraction to the free space can happen , the guided mode in such dielectric membranes can be excited .",
    "the power coupled at some point is no longer localized within the particle , but can propagate within the dielectric layer , thus the metamaterial can not be effectively homogenized .",
    "we have investigated the metamaterial made of high - dielectric rings . even though the selected @xmath79 is modest ( dielectric constant of barium strontium titanate",
    "may reach several hundreds [ ] ) , it is representative enough to make general enough conclusions .",
    "we may accurately anticipate the behaviour of the lower - index dielectrics .",
    "they might better suite to homogenization , having smaller refractive index contrast with the background .",
    "however , the unusual properties , based on strong electric and magnetic resonances , would also be weaker .    in conclusion , the all - dielectric ring metamaterials can be described with electric and magnetic point dipole approximation if the meta - atoms size ( ring radius ) is smaller than 0.8 of the period . for the meta - atoms that almost touch each other , the dipole approximation is not applicable .",
