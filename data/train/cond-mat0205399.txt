    "nematic liquid crystals ( nematics ) represent one of the simplest anisotropic fluid @xcite . in order to describe the macroscopic dynamics of these materials made up from elongated molecules one introduces as additional hydrodynamic variable a unit vector * n * , the _ director _ , which describes the axis of local preffered molecular orientation .",

    "one can conclude from ( [ acsimp ] ) that only the product @xmath111 plays an essential role in the transition from rolls of i type symmetry to rolls of ii type , not @xmath78 itself .",
    "let us now return to the question of neglecting the inertia term in eq.([basveleq ] ) for the basic velocity .",

    ", one should note that the frequency dependence of the critical wave number @xmath71 in the one - mode approximation does for i type rolls not show the saturation like in the numerical calculations .    for @xmath117 ,",
    "when @xmath118 , one can expand eqs.([acsimp ] ) in @xmath119 .",
    "for the threshold of ii type rolls one gets @xmath120^{1/2 } \\frac{1}{\\omega\\tau_d}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath121 for @xmath122 one can see that @xmath123 is inversely proportional to @xmath101 .    by increasing @xmath101 the critical amplitude @xmath124 of mode i appears to tend to a constant value already at rather low @xmath101 , where @xmath125 .",
    "such behavior was found in @xcite by an one - mode analysis .",
    "one can show that this feature is not a artefact of the one - time - mode approximation .",
    "the same result can be obtained by inspection of the high - frequency limit in ( [ nxex])-([nzex ] ) ( see appendix [ appenhf ] ) .",
    "summarizing , we conclude from our analysis that increasing of the oscillatory flow frequency ( for given cell thickness @xmath126 ) leads to switching from i to ii symmetry type roll instability .",
    "it has been shown that this transition is caused by the inertia of the nematic fluid described by the parameter @xmath112 .",
    "for mbba material parameters one has the transition at @xmath127 .",
    "consequently , in the pg experiment @xcite with the same liquid crystal and @xmath128 m the transition frequency should occur of about @xmath129  hz ( maximal frequency in this experiment was @xmath130  2 hz ) .",
    "recent experiments @xcite , @xcite show that this transition could be observed .",
    "experiments of mullin and peacock ( mp ) @xcite performed with the nematic e7 show the existence of a roll instability at least up to 160 hz with @xmath126 between @xmath131 and @xmath132 m . mp report , that the observation of probe particle have not shown any macroscopic flow , which could mean that the rolls are of ii , i.e. , the oscillating type .",
    "we have found in the literature only the values of the elastic constants for e7 @xcite , so that we are not able to perform a direct comparison of our theoretical results with the mp experimental data .",
    "one can consider the influence of material parameters variation on the instability type .",
    "the results of this consideration are presented in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "a good test for the quality of oscillatory couette flow realized in experiments is scaling law , which says , that @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is some function to be determined from nematodynamic equations .",
    "the experimental data of mp @xcite satisfy this test only in a rather narrow region of low frequencies , namely , up to about 40 hz . at higher frequencies the scaling law becomes broken , which could be caused by failure of surface anchoring .",
    "oscillatory shear flow was investigated experimentally also by anikeev and kapustina @xcite .",
    "the authors used an eutectic mixture of mbba and ebba , which is known to have almost the same material parameters as mbba .",
    "a geometry where the director is anchored in the plane of the layer at an angle @xmath135 to the shear direction was investigated .",
    "for the case @xmath136 , which we are interested in , the frequency dependence of @xmath69 and @xmath71 are presented .",
    "the experimental points taken from @xcite are given in fig.[aw2 - 800 ] together with theoretical curves .",
    "the agreement between experimental and theoretical data is good .",
    "applying an electric field across the nematic layer can lead to the switching in particular between the different types of temporal symmetry of rolls induced by oscillatory shear flow . in the case of mbba",
    "a change of the roll instability of i type to ii type by increasing the electric field strength was observed @xcite .",
    "we performed the stability analysis of the linearized equations ( [ vx])-([nz ] ) in a wide range of oscillatory flow frequency and electric field strength for mbba , which has a _ negative _ anisotropy of the dielectric permeativity .",
    "we have found that the electric field can change not only the temporal symmetry of instability , but also the spatial one . the phase diagram ( fig .  [ phased ] ) presents the area , where the rolls with symmetry type iii appear at threshold . according to their spatial symmetry",
    "these rolls represent a double - layered structure , so that the critical wave number in this area is about two times larger than otherwise . for low values of @xmath101",
    "an applied electric field leads to an increase of the area of homogeneous instability ( @xmath137 ) , so that the electric field suppress the roll instability .",
    "the profiles of the velocity and the director in the various modes are plotted in fig .",
    "[ profiles ] .",
    "we have also calculated the phase diagram for a nematic with _ positive _ dielectric anisotropy ( fig.[pdpos ] ) .",
    "the material parameters were taken from mbba except for setting the dielectric anisotropy to be positive .",
    "in this case the phase diagram ( fig.[pdpos ] ) presents an extensive area of rolls of ii symmetry type . at low @xmath101",
    "there is a switching between homogeneous instabilities of i and ii types by varying the electric field .",
    "note , that under these conditions fredericksz transition takes place at voltage @xmath138 ( @xmath139 v ) . as a result ,",
    "when @xmath140 approaches @xmath138 , the critical shear amplitude @xmath69 goes to zero .",
    "the one - mode analysis in this case gives unsatisfactory agreement with the full numerical calculations , although it keeps all the important features ( switching between modes _ etc .",
    "we obtained the complete phase diagram of the orientational instabilities , both homogeneous and spatially periodic , in nematic liquid crystal subjected to oscillatory couette flow based on the linear stability analysis of the full set of nematodynamic equations .",
    "it has been found for the first time that the inertia of nematic fluid , usually neglected in the theoretical considerations , is responsible for the new type of roll instability and switching between roll instabilities with different time - symmetry .",
    "the results of approximate analytical analysis show an essential features of the influence of inertia of nematic fluid on the instability scenarios and are in a good agreement with full numerical simulations of underlying equations . for the nematic liquid crystal mbba increasing of flow frequency",
    "leads to the transition between rolls of i and ii symmetry types .",
    "both these modes can be easily distinguished in the experiments .",
    "although there are no reports concerning the observations of this transition , the recent experiments on oscillatory flow in nematics show that the technical possibilities are rich enough to observe such effect .",
    "we have also investigated the influence of additional electric field applied across the nematic layer on the flow instabilities for the liquid crystals with negative and positive dielectric anisotropy . in case of mbba",
    "it was found that the electric field causes transition to the double - layered roll structure , which is intermediate regime between rolls of i and ii types observed in @xcite .",
    "another interesting point in the experimental investigations could be the transition between rolls of the same symmetry but quite different wave numbers at increasing of flow frequency ( @xmath141ii@xmath142 and @xmath141ii@xmath143 in fig.2 ) .",
