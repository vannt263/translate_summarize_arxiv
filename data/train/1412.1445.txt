    "<S> we calculate the energy deposition by very short laser pulses in sio@xmath0 ( @xmath1-quartz ) with a view to establishing systematics for predicting damage and nanoparticle production . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical framework is time - dependent density functional theory , implemented by the real - time method in a multiscale representation . for the most realistic simulations we employ a meta - gga kohn - sham potential similar to that of becke and johnson . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the deposited energy in the medium can be accurately modeled as a function of the local electromagnetic pulse fluence . </S>",
    "<S> the energy - deposition function can in turn be quite well fitted to the strong - field keldysh formula for a range of intensities from below the melting threshold to well beyond the ablation threshold . </S>",
    "<S> we find reasonable agreement between the damage threshold and the energy required to melt the substrate . the ablation threshold estimated by the energy to convert the substrate to an atomic fluid is higher than the measurement , indicating significance of nonthermal nature of the process . </S>",
    "<S> a fair agreement is found for the depth of the ablation .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction . </S>",
    "<S> _ ablation of surfaces by intense femtosecond laser pulses is potentially a useful tool for material machining as well as preparation of nanosized particles@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to have good models of the energy deposition and the ablation process to set up the pulse protocols for the purpose in mind . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is not easy to model the laser - target interaction because one has to deal with the quantum physics at the atomic scale together with the pulse propagation at a mesoscopic scale .    </S>",
    "<S> there is a large literature on the modeling of the laser - target interaction dynamics @xcite , as reviewed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite as well as ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental physics is the excitation of particle - hole pairs , often parameterized by keldysh s approximate formulas @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the particle and hole carriers affect the electromagnetic response of the insulator , screening the field when their density becomes large . here </S>",
    "<S> the effects are often parameterized by hybrid dielectric functions containing contributions intrinsic to the insulator and plasma contributions from the excited electrons . </S>",
    "<S> both aspects of this electron dynamics are included in the time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) , which is fully quantum mechanical and does nt require any specific assumptions about the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> it also gives a good compromise between ab initio theory and computational feasibility . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we shall apply the dynamic equations of tddft to calculate the propagation of short , intense electromagnetic pulses upon insulators and compute the energy transfer to the medium .    in recent work , tddft with strong fields </S>",
    "<S> has been applied to condensed media in several contexts : coherent phonon generation @xcite and high - field interactions with diamond , silicon and quartz @xcite . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we treat the energy transfer to a crystalline sio@xmath0 , @xmath1-quartz , a material of technological importance . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations require high - performance computers , so our goal is to also analyze the results in terms of simpler models that can be easily applied . </S>",
    "<S> we only discuss the deposited energy of the pulse , which is the most important determinant of the subsequent atomic dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> since tddft employing practically usable functionals does not have any relaxation processes , it is limited to short - time dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the main limitations to consider are the electron - electron kinetic relaxation time @xmath2 , the full electron thermalization time , and the electron - phonon equilibration time . </S>",
    "<S> the latter two processes have time scale much larger than 100 fs , which is well beyond the time domain considered here . </S>",
    "<S> estimates of @xmath2 range from 1 fs to 100 fs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately for the modeling by tddft , the response of insulators to high fields is rather insensitive to the kinetic equilibration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that on very long time scales another mechanism that is missing from tddft becomes important , namely an avalanche of electrons in the free carrier bands @xcite .    _ </S>",
    "<S> computational method . </S>",
    "<S> _ the theory and its implementation used in the present calculation has been described elsewhere @xcite , so we will just summarize the major points . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics are derived from a lagrangian that includes the full electromagnetic gauge field @xmath3 as well as the kohn - sham dynamics of the tddft . </S>",
    "<S> thus the equations of motion can describe the pulse propagation from the vacuum into the medium and its attenuation by exciting electrons from the valence to the conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> the quantities of interest vary on a scale of micrometers , while the electron dynamics requires a sub - nanometer scale . </S>",
    "<S> this conflict is overcome by separating contributions to the electric field into a contribution @xmath4 varying only on the larger scale and a contribution @xmath5 that has the full atomic - scale variation in the crystalline unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling between the scales arises from the current @xmath6 associated with the electrons in the unit cell .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we use a modified becke - johnson exchange - correlation potential ( mbj ) @xcite as given by ref . </S>",
    "<S> ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * eq . 2 - 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated indirect band gap with this potential is 1.3 ev lower than the experimental gap of @xmath7 ev , but more relevant to electromagnetic interactions is the optical gap . </S>",
    "<S> this is calculated to be @xmath8 ev from the absorptive part of the dielectric function for the mbj potential , compared to the experimental value of @xmath9 ev . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the energy transfer to the medium from the electromagnetic side , since the calculation from the kohn - sham densities would require an explicit energy density functional for the mbj potential . the energy transfer rate @xmath10 is given by w = - j , where @xmath11 is the electric field associated with the pulse . in comparing different pulse lengths and intensities , we find the most convenient measure of the pulse strength is its fluence @xmath12 given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the depth from the surface . with these definitions , </S>",
    "<S> the deposited energy density is given by @xmath15    our multiscale calculation uses a one - dimensional grid with spacing of @xmath16 au for propagation of laser electromagnetic fields . at each grid point , electron dynamics is calculated using atomic - scale rectangular unit cell containing @xmath17 silicon atoms and @xmath18 oxygen atoms which are discretized into cartesian grids of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the @xmath20 valence electrons is treated explicitly ; the effects of the core electrons are taken into account by pseudopotentials @xcite . both electromagnetic fields and electrons </S>",
    "<S> are evolved with a common time step of 0.02 au .    </S>",
    "<S> the laser pulse in the vacuum is described by a gauge field @xmath21 of the form a(x , t ) = z a_0 ^ 2(t_x / t_p ) ( t_x ) in the domain @xmath22 and zero outside . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 is the photon s angular frequency , @xmath24 describes the space - time dependence of the field , and @xmath25 controls the pulse length . </S>",
    "<S> it is related to the usual measure @xmath26 ( full width at half - maximum intensity ) by @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> most of the results below were calculated for an average photon energy of @xmath28 ev and the pulse length of @xmath29 fs . </S>",
    "<S> we follow the pulse from the time its front reaches the surface ( @xmath30 ) until it has propagated several @xmath31 m into the material .    </S>",
    "<S> _ results . </S>",
    "<S> _ we first note that our calculated reflectivity of @xmath1-quartz , shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ r ] , is close to @xmath32 for laser fluence below 1.5 j/@xmath33 increasing to about @xmath34 at fluence 10 j/@xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> the rise at high field intensity is due to the screening effect of an electron - hole plasma that is formed . </S>",
    "<S> the figure shows the reflectivity for both the mbj potential and the lda energy functional from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one may see that the screening has a lower threshold for lda functional . </S>",
    "<S> this can be attributed to the lower band gap in lda , permitting a more dense plasma to form .    </S>",
    "<S> the main quantity we can calculate is the deposited energy @xmath35 as a function of penetration depth @xmath14 . the range of interest extends roughly from the energy required to melt the solid to the energy required to vaporize it . </S>",
    "<S> the first transition requires about 0.5 ev / atom in quartz , starting from room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the second transition is not as well defined ; we can estimate it as 6 ev / atom either as the heat of formation or from the  atomic - liquid \" transition reported in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a sampling of the results for the multiscale calculation is shown in figs . 2 - 7 . </S>",
    "<S> in fig . [ surface ] , we show the deposited energy density at the surface for a range of laser fluences .    the threshold for achieving melting is @xmath36 , while the vaporization threshold as we have defined it is at @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for applications that physically transform the material , we need to only consider fluences of the order @xmath38 and and higher . </S>",
    "<S> the figure shows the deposited energies of lower strength pulses as well , which may be of interest to analyze the parametric dependence of the energy deposition on the characteristics of the pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the figure also shows the results for the lda functional . </S>",
    "<S> one sees that lower - fluence pulses are more highly absorbed in lda . </S>",
    "<S> this is to be expected due to the small band gap . </S>",
    "<S> the difference becomes small and even changes sign at high fluence . </S>",
    "<S> a possible explanation might be an increased screening for the lda , as was discussed for the reflectivity .    </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of @xmath35 on the depth in the medium is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ evsi ] for a range of pulse intensities , all with pulse length of @xmath39 fs .    </S>",
    "<S> one sees that the melted region extends to a depth of 0.5 - 0.6 @xmath31 m for the stronger pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the depth permitting ablation only extends to 0.13 @xmath31 m for a pulse of 10 times the threshold intensity .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pulse - shape ] compares the pulse profile for the @xmath40 pulse at two points , in the first cell and in the 80th cell at a depth of 1.06 @xmath31 m . at this depth </S>",
    "<S> , the intensity has decreased below the melting threshold . </S>",
    "<S> one sees that the shapes are quite similar . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference is that the attenuation is stronger in the later arriving cycles of the pulse train . </S>",
    "<S> this is to be expected ; the early part of the pulse creates particle - hole pairs which can then modify the propagation of the rest of the pulse .    _ </S>",
    "<S> approximate description . _ </S>",
    "<S> the mild changes in pulse shape suggest that the energy deposition might be modeled simply as a function of the strength of the pulse as it is attenuated in the medium . </S>",
    "<S> to see how well this works , we extract the local fluence of the pulses at the different cells in our simulation . </S>",
    "<S> the absorbed energy versus the local fluence for the range of pulses shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ evsi ] is plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ ea - vs - f ] . </S>",
    "<S> we see that they fall on a common line ,    extending down to a fluence of  1 , well below the damage threshold . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the change in pulse shapes can indeed be neglected , at least for @xmath41 fs pulses . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the dependence can be very well fitted following keldysh s strong - field ionization rate equation ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * eq . ( 9 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> an approximate formula expressing the energy deposition in terms of the fluence is e_x = a f^5/4 ( - b / f^1/2 ) . the two - parameter fit ( @xmath42 ev-()@xmath43b= 4.0@xmath44()@xmath45 ) is shown as the solid black line in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> one sees that the fit is valid from fluences from well below the thresholds to the highest calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the fit value @xmath46 can be compared to the value obtained from a reduction of keldysh s exponential factor , [ exponential ] b = _ </S>",
    "<S> p^1/2m^1/2 ^1/4 ^ 3/2 /2 , in atomic units . taking the reduced mass @xmath47 , the direct band gap @xmath48 ev , and the dielectric constant @xmath49 , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ exponential ] ) gives @xmath50 , a difference of only 5% from the fit value . </S>",
    "<S> the multiphoton process is only relevant at much lower fluences that are needed for structural changes .    _ </S>",
    "<S> experimental . </S>",
    "<S> _ while it is not entirely clear how energy deposition profiles link to structural changes in the surface region , we can still compare the theory and experiment assuming that the melting and vaporization transitions control the surface damage and ablation . </S>",
    "<S> there are many measurements of thresholds for these quantities , but only a few for pulse as short as @xmath51 fs or below @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ data ] shows a comparison with the data of refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for fused silica . for the damage threshold shown by red symbols , </S>",
    "<S> we compare with calculated fluences to achieve @xmath52 ev / atom at the surface . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the experimental threshold is in qualitative correspondence with that value .    </S>",
    "<S> the ablation threshold , shown by green symbols , is much lower than predicted by the @xmath53 ev / atom criterion based on the formation of an atomic liquid @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this may indicate an importance of nonthermal effects in the ablation process by femtosecond laser pulses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the reported thresholds for damage and ablation at @xmath54 fs in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite are nearly identical . </S>",
    "<S> this may be seen by the sharp edges of the ablation craters formed at the shortest pulse lengths . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps one needs to consider a different mechanism for ablation at threshold , which may involve the electric fields produced when excited electrons are ejected from the surface . </S>",
    "<S> it should also be kept in mind that damage threshold depends on structures of the material ; a lower threshold is reported for fused silica than crystalline sio@xmath0 using much longer pulses@xcite .    as a final theory - experiment comparison , </S>",
    "<S> we examine the depth of the ablated craters as a function of the fluence of the pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the available experimental data is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ depth ] . </S>",
    "<S> for the theory , we report the depth at which the deposited energy falls to @xmath53 ev / atom , as in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ data ] . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between theory and experiment is quite satisfactory . </S>",
    "<S> the theory reproduces the very sharp rise above threshold as well as the saturation at high fluences .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> _ we have shown that it is feasible to calculate the interaction of intense femtosecond laser pulses with insulating media by the tddft , avoiding the detailed modeling of plasma formation and dynamics required in earlier theoretical treatments . the threshold for damage </S>",
    "<S> is accounted for by the calculated energy deposition needed to melt the quartz substrate . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the calculated threshold for ablation via a transformation to an atomic liquid is 50% higher than the low values observed in two experiments . </S>",
    "<S> this may suggest the significance of nonthermal mechanism in the ablation process . </S>",
    "<S> it may also indicate that another mechanism is responsible for the threshold behavior , such as an electric - field assisted ionic dissociation . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find good agreement with experiment on the depth of the ablation taking the energy deposition criterion to estimate the depth </S>",
    "<S> . it may well be that modeling energy deposition in wide - gap insulators could be greatly simplified once one has a suitable set of benchmark multiscale calculations based on the tddft . </S>"
