    "members and friends of the jet collaboration made predictions for the @xmath2 tev @xmath0pb run at the lhc in the winter of 2013 .",
    "predictions were collected for charged hadrons ; identified particles such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ; photons ; jets ; @xmath6 ; and gauge bosons .",
    "the observables included individual distributions , ratios such as @xmath7 , and correlation functions .",
    "the paper in which these predictions were compiled @xcite was submitted to this journal and to arxiv.org before the @xmath0pb run began in 2013 .",
    "this paper presents the confrontation of the predictions with data currently available .",
    "the test beam results for @xmath8 published by the alice collaboration @xcite were presented for the case where the lead beam moved to the right , in the direction of positive rapidity , in ref .",
    "[ ] because this was the accelerator configuration employed for the test run .",
    "therefore , all predictions for @xmath9 were reflected to conform to that convention .",
    "however , for the full 2013 run , since some of the detectors , alice and lhcb in particular , are asymmetric around midrapidity , some of the data were taken in a @xmath0pb configuration ( the proton beam moving toward forward rapidity ) and the rest were taken in a pb@xmath10 configuration ( the lead beam moving toward forward rapidity , as in the case of the test run ) .",
    "thus , further publications have generally employed the typical convention , from fixed - target facilities , where the proton beam moves in the direction of positive rapidity .",
    "thus , in this paper , all results are presented assuming this convention unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "in ref .  [ ] , detailed descriptions of the approaches used to calculate the charged particle multiplicities , @xmath11 distributions and nuclear modification factors , @xmath7 , in @xmath0pb collisions were given .",
    "therefore the model descriptions will not be repeated here and instead only a brief summary of the various approaches is presented in this section . note that almost all approaches involve some parameters tuned at a specific energy to predict results for other energies . for details , consult ref .

    "the running coupling corrections to the leading log bk equation , rcbk , have been phenomenologically successful in describing the rapidity / energy evolution of the dipole @xcite .",
    "the initial condition still needs to be modeled , generally employing the mclerran - venugopalan model @xcite with parameters constrained by data .",

    "[ fig : z - fbasy@ppb ] . differences between the three nuclear modifications are emphasized by the asymmetry .",
    "isospin alone gives only a small forward - backward asymmetry while nuclear modifications such as antishadowing give a larger symmetry , 20 - 25% .",
    "the ncteq nuclear modification gives the largest asymmetry .",
    "the calculations agree with the data within the uncertainties .",
    "however , the data favor nuclear modifications with eps09 nlo and ncteq in the region @xmath310 .",
    "the lhcb collaboration has measured the @xmath293 forward - bacward asymmetry in a different , more forward , rapidity region from cms  @xcite .",
    "the forward and backward cross sections have been measured in the region @xmath301  gev , @xmath311  gev , and @xmath312 in the laboratory frame . in the center of mass frame",

    "[ fig : z - fbasylhcb@ppb ] .",
    "the calculations in the forward region agree with the data while , in the backward region , the results are much smaller than the data , even though the experimental uncertainty is rather large .    on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : z - fbasylhcb@ppb ] , the forward - backward ratios @xmath315 are calculated at nnlo and compared to the lhcb data .",
    "the ratio is defined as @xmath316 the calculations considerably overestimate the data . in addition , the uncertainty with the nuclear pdfs is rather small .",
    "thus the deviation between theory and data is significant . considering the results of the individual forward and backward cross sections ,",
    "this overestimate is likely due to a significant ( factor of 3 - 4 ) underestimate of the backward cross section .",
    "there seems to be an apparent mismatch between the ratio of the forward to backward cross sections as seen on the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : z - fbasylhcb@ppb ] . a ` by - eye ' view might lead one to expect @xmath317 .",
    "however , in this panel , the forward and backward regions cover the entire rapidity space of 2.5 units .",
    "when the rapidity range is restricted to 1.5 units the statistical signal is reduced , leading to the value of @xmath318 on the right - hand side .",
    "note that the lhcb results are based on a fairly small sample of @xmath293 bosons so that , while the signal is strong , the statistical signifcance is not .",
    "there are four @xmath293 candidates in the backward rapidity region and eleven at forward rapidity over the full phase space . when the range is restricted to the overlap of the forward and backward regions , only two candidates are left in the forward region while the four candidates in the backward region are not reduced .",
    "after corections for acceptance in the different regions are taken into account the measured @xmath245 is reduced to @xmath319 .    to leading order",
    ", the momentum fraction @xmath18 carried by initial parton in the nucleus for @xmath320 @xmath293 boson production at rapidity @xmath321 is @xmath322 .",
    "thus @xmath323 in the forward rapidity region and @xmath324 in the backward direction for lhcb .",
    "also note that forward @xmath293 production proceeds via nuclear sea quarks , @xmath325 and @xmath326 ( with only small higher order contributions from gluons ) , while backward @xmath293 production is dominated by nuclear valence quarks , @xmath327 and @xmath328  @xcite .",
    "therefore the forward - backward ratio can schematically be written as @xmath329 ) } { r_{u_v , d_v}(x\\in[0.22 , 0.989 ] ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\thicksim & \\frac{u_s , d_s \\ , { \\rm shadowing}}{u_v , d_v \\ , { \\rm emc } } \\ , \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath330 is the flavor - dependent nuclear modification factor .",
    "the nuclear effect in the forward region is thus predominantly related to sea quark shadowing while that in the backward direction is mainly due to emc effects on the valence quarks  @xcite .",
    "because the forward and backward yields in the rapidity region covered by lhcb are rather small  @xcite , the experimental precision should be improved for more robust comparisons of the calculations to data .",
    "unfortunately the rapidity regions of cms and lhcb do not overlap .",
    "however , it is clear that the forward - backward ratio in the rapidity range measured by lhcb is significantly lower than one would expect from extrapolating the cms data to higher rapidity .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry for @xmath331 boson production has also been measured by cms  @xcite .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry is calculated to nlo as a function of the charged lepton pseudorapidity and compared to the cms data .",
    "figure  [ fig : w - fbasy@ppb ] shows that the calculations can describe the cms data rather well .",
    "the @xmath306 data seem to favor the isospin alone , without any addition nuclear pdf modifications in the region @xmath332 . however , the @xmath307 data are in better agreement with the eps09 and ncteq modifications .",
    "note also that the asymmetry is large and greater than unity for the @xmath306 while the @xmath307 asymmetry is small and less than unity , similar to that of the @xmath293 .",
    "indeed , the asymmetry for @xmath307 , on the right - hand side of fig .",

    "e.g. _ between the @xmath336 and @xmath337 valence quarks @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising because , at a given value of @xmath24 , the @xmath306 and @xmath307 probe the same @xmath18 values and thus nearly the same values of the npdfs .      the nlo and nnlo perturbative qcd calculations of vector boson production have been compared to the lhc data .",
    "the calculations shown generally good agreement with the data except for the low statistics forward - backward asymmetry measured by lhcb .",
    "the results are not sensitive to the choice of free proton pdfs .",
    "however , there is a clear distinction between calculations with different parametrizations of the npdfs for observables such as the pseudorapidity distribution and the forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "the significant deviation of the calculations from the lhcb data could arise from a poor understnading of the modifications of the valence quark distributions at large @xmath18 , @xmath338 $ ] .",
    "alternatively it could be resolved by a higher - statistics measurement .",
    "the first measurements of vector boson production in @xmath0pb collisions at the lhc have demonstrated the capability of studying cold nuclear matter effects at @xmath339 and high momentum transfers , @xmath340 .",
    "further robust theoretical investigations and more precise data are needed to place stringent constraints on the npdfs and thus gain a deeper understanding of cold nuclear matter effects in this relatively unexplored region .",
    "at low transverse momentum , @xmath341 , the conventional fixed - order calculation for the @xmath342 boson differential cross section , @xmath343 , includes a large logarithm @xmath344 .",
    "the convergence of a conventional perturbative expansion is thus impaired and these large logarithms must be resummed .",
    "the collins - soper - sterman ( css ) formalism is well - known and was developed for precisely such purposes  @xcite .",
