    "during the past few decades the search for life elsewhere in the universe has risen to the forefront of scientific research @xcite .",
    "this is motivated by recent discoveries of exoplanets , including the discoveries of super - earths @xcite and earth - like planets @xcite , opening up the possibility of a potentially large number of habitable planetary platforms beyond earth .",
    "in addition , carbon isotopic evidence indicating that life existed on earth at least as early as @xmath0 billion years ago ( bya ) @xcite , and the discoveries of extremophilic life forms on earth @xcite , suggest that life can survive and even thrive under harsher conditions than previously imagined . in light of such evidence",
    ", it is reasonable to conjecture that at least simple , unicellular life may be more common in the universe than anticipated . when attempting to answer the question of how widespread life is , it is pertinent to examine the only example of abiogenesis known to date : the origin of life on earth .",
    "one of the most distinctive features of life ",
    "the existence of a specific and seemingly universal chiral signature  also presents one of the longest standing mysteries in studies of abiogenesis .",
    "it is well  known that chiral selectivity plays a key role in the biochemistry of living systems : nearly all life on earth contains exclusively dextrorotary sugars and levorotary amino acids . quite possibly , the development of homochirality was a critical step in the emergence of life .",
    "although there are numerous models for the onset of homochirality presented in the literature , none is conclusive : the details of chirobiogenesis remain unknown .",
    "we propose that the environment of early earth played a crucial role in chirobiogenesis .",
    "environmental effects , when strong enough , can destroy any memory of a prior chiral bias , whatever its origin .",
    "they can also drive a specific chiral choice . life s",
    "chirality is interwoven with early - earth s environmental history ; specifically , with how the environment influenced the prebiotic soup that led to first life .",
    "the same should be true of life anywhere in the cosmos . as remarked in ref .",
    "@xcite , _ the history of life in a planet mirrors the planet s life history .",
    "_ here , it will be argued that the same is true for life s chirality .",
    "the rapidity with which life first appeared on earth is often cited as evidence that life may be common in the universe .",
    "observational constraints on the timescale for the origin of life on earth suggest that earth - like planets older than about @xmath1 gyr support their own abiogeneses with a probability @xmath2 at the @xmath3 confidence level @xcite .",
    "combining this estimate with results demonstrating that earth  like planets in habitable zones may be a common byproduct of star formation @xcite , the search for extraterrestrial life may yield promising results in the near future .",
    "however , until extraterrestrial life is discovered , the existence of life on earth is our only insight into abiogenesis , presenting important clues on the likelihood of life elsewhere in the universe",
    ".    given early earth s tumultuous environment , it is remarkable that paleontological evidence suggests life may have been thriving as early as @xmath0 bya @xcite . perhaps even more surprising",
    "are results suggesting that any early life may have been killed off as late as @xmath4 bya @xcite .",
    "these findings indicate that the origin and early diversification of life occurred within a window as short as @xmath5 million years .",
    "additional constraints stemming from the half  life of prebiotic compounds and the recycling of oceans through hydrothermal vents set an even shorter timescale for abiogenesis , estimated to be as brief as @xmath6 million years @xcite",
    ".    the short timescales constraining the origin of life on earth shed little light on the environmental conditions required for abiogenesis .",
    "the question of where life began remains open , with few details known about where the first prebiotic ingredients may have been synthesized .",
    "potential sites for the origin of life include submarine vents @xcite , primordial beaches @xcite , and shallow pools and lagoons @xcite .",
    "an even more debated aspect of the puzzle is whether the ingredients for life originated on earth or were delivered to earth from outerspace @xcite .",
    "evidence supporting the latter hypothesis includes the ubiquity of organic chemical ingredients in the interstellar medium @xcite and in the solar system in carbonaceous chondrites @xcite .",
    "however , organic compounds have also been shown to be readily synthesized under conditions likely to be prevalant on the prebiotic earth @xcite .",
    "of equal ambiguity is the mechanism of abiogenesis .",
    "although the uniformity of life on earth suggests that all extant organisms descended from a last universal common ancestor ( luca ) , we know almost nothing about the abiotic ingredients and prebiotic chemistries present on the primitive earth from which the luca evolved @xcite .",
    "potential mechanisms range from `` metabolism - first '' models , such as the iron - sulfide world hypothesis of wchtershuser @xcite and `` membrane  first '' lipid - world scenarios as investigated by deamer and coworkers @xcite , to the `` peptide - first '' models proposed by fox @xcite and others @xcite , and the popular `` genetics - first '' hypotheses such as the rna @xcite and pre - rna @xcite world scenarios . in considering any of these models ,",
    "one must investigate how the characteristic properties of life might have arisen  including the emergence of homochirality .",
    "with such a short window for the origin of life , it is likely that the primordial earth experienced multiple abiogeneses . as has been pointed out by davies and lineweaver @xcite ,",
    "if large impacts had frustrated abiogenesis , then as the frequency of impacts abated at the end of heavy bombardment , there would have been brief quiescent periods when life may have emerged only to be annihilated by the next large impact .",
    "extending this to studies of potential abiogenic mechanisms , we must therefore be mindful that in prebiotic earth reactor pools were submitted to environmental disturbances ranging from mild ( e.g. tides , evaporating lagoons ) to severe ( e.g. volcanic eruptions , meteoritic impacts ) . both kinds of disturbances must have affected the evolution of chirality in early earth @xcite . for the remainder of this work , we will discuss how such a scenario might have played out .",
    "a much - debated question is whether the observed homochirality of biomolecules is a prerequisite for life s emergence or if it developed as its consequence @xcite . adding to the mystery",
    ", prebiotically relevant laboratory syntheses yield racemic mixtures @xcite .",
    "this is especially surprising given that statistical fluctuations of reactants will invariably bias one enantiomer over the other @xcite : every synthesis is _ ab initio _ asymmetric .",
    "it is thus clear that this asymmetry is erased as the reactions unfold .",
    "therefore , a chiral selection process must have occurred at some stage in the origin or early evolution of life @xcite .",
    "a common viewpoint is that chiral selection occurred at the molecular level @xcite , and that the resultant complexity of molecular species led to the eventual emergence of life .",
    "this view is based on the argument that life could neither exist nor originate without biomolecular asymmetry @xcite , and is supported by experiments demonstrating that specific conformations of structural entities such as @xmath7-helices and @xmath8-sheets can only form from enantiomerically - pure building blocks @xcite ( for an alternative viewpoint see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . taking this bottom - up approach , we therefore assume that the prebiotic conditions necessary for the subsequent development of complex biomolecules had to be chiral .      although it was louis pasteur @xcite , inspired by previous work by biot , who in the late 1840s was the first to recognize that many biomolecules display mirror asymmetry , it was not until the pioneering work of frank @xcite , over one  hundred years later , that the first breakthrough in understanding the origin of this asymmetry was presented . in this influential work , frank identified autocatalysis and some form of mutual antagonism as necessary ingredients for obtaining biomolecular homochirality from prebiotic precursors . in the ensuing decades ,",
    "many models exhibiting such features have been proposed , each providing its own description of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the various models presented in the literature range from investigations of simple modifications to frank s original model @xcite , to more recent studies describing the onset of homochirality in crystallization @xcite , and chiral selection during polymerization @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion ) . among these `` frank '' models ,",
    "one of the better known is that of sandars @xcite , which provides a basis for understanding chiral symmetry breaking in a rna world @xcite .",
    "this model succeeds because it includes both of the necessary features of antagonism and autocatalysis as originally proposed by frank , where the mutual antagonism is provided by enantiomeric cross - inhibition as is observed in template  directed polycondensation of polynucleotides @xcite .",
    "( these terms will be clarified below . )    as various authors have pointed out @xcite , when addressing the validity of the sandars model one must consider that the autocatalysis necessary for chiral symmetry breaking in such systems is presently only observed for a few non - biological molecules @xcite , and would be trying to achieve with even very simple organic molecules @xcite . despite this shortcoming ,",
    "the rna world hypothesis is still deemed viable by some authors @xcite .",
    "in addition , the sandars model provides an elegant , and relatively simple , model of chiral symmetry breaking while sharing general features in common with other ( usually more complicated ) models , and as such it has been extensively studied in the literature @xcite . as we know little about the compositions of the primitive atmospheres and seas @xcite and even less about prebiotic chemistry @xcite , it is pertinent to study general features as opposed to details of specific models .",
    "we thus begin by investigating the sandars model as the basis of our study with the reasonable expectation that the results should be qualitatively similar for other models .",
    "we will then briefly describe a recently developed polymerization model that obtains a substantial amount of chiral bias without any specific external source : only the reaction rates display chiral dependence which may be induced environmentally @xcite .      while the details of models describing the onset of prebiotic homochirality mentioned above differ , the qualitative features are the same ; chiral symmetry breaking occurs due to the introduction of instabilities to the symmetric ( racemic ) state that lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking in physical systems @xcite . in other words , the spatiotemporal dynamics of the reaction network",
    "is equivalent to a two - phase system undergoing a symmetry - breaking phase transition , where the order parameter is the net chiral asymmetry , @xmath9 .",
    "if we define @xmath10 and @xmath11 as the sums of all left and right  handed chiral subunits , respectively , then the net chirality may be defined as @xmath12 note that the net chirality is symmetric @xmath13 in the racemic state , and asymmetric @xmath14 in the non - racemic states .",
    "the reaction network is a nonlinear dynamical system with behavior controlled by model ",
    "dependent parameters , including fidelity of enzymatic reactions @xcite , ratios of reaction rates @xcite , stereoselectivity @xcite and total mass @xcite .",
    "just as in other areas of physics , environmental interactions can restore the system to the symmetric ( racemic ) state , even in cases where model parameters are set such that the asymmetric state is stable .",
    "in such cases , it is important to consider how temperature , or other environmental effects , might work to restore the stability of the racemic state .",
    "thinking in this direction , it was salam @xcite who first suggested that there should be a critical temperature , @xmath15 , above which any net chirality is destroyed .",
    "one can think in analogy with a ferromagnet : if heated through the curie point any net magnetization is erased and the system is restored to a symmetric configuration . here",
    ", the net chirality plays the role of the net magnetization . while salam conceded that calculating @xmath15 would be challenging using the electroweak theory of particle physics ( assuming the weak force biases chiral selection @xcite ) , a different route was recently taken by gleiser and thorarinson @xcite .",
    "coupling the reaction network to an external environment modeled by a stochastic force , they were able to determine the critical point for homochirality in two and three dimensions .",
    "we move now to a discussion of their work .",
    "although the work of gleiser and thorarinson was based on the sandars model , from the above discussion and the work of gleiser and walker @xcite we expect the results to be quite general .",
    "the reaction - network proposed by sandars includes the following polymerization reactions : @xmath16 supplemented by reactions for @xmath17-polymers by interchanging @xmath18 ( consistent with biochemical usage , we denote @xmath17-compounds by the letter `` @xmath17 '' as opposed to the notation set in sandars work where such molecules were denoted as `` @xmath19 '' ) .",
    "a left - handed polymer @xmath20 , made of @xmath21 left - handed monomers , @xmath22 , may grow by adding another left - handed monomer with a rate @xmath23 , or be inhibited by adding a right - handed monomer @xmath24 with a rate @xmath25 .",
    "the latter process is referred to as enantiomeric cross - inhibition : attachment of a monomer with opposite chirality to one end of a growing chain terminates growth on that end of the chain @xcite and inhibits any further enzymatic activity .",
    "this process is the driving force that causes a net asymmetry to develop in this model @xcite .",
    "in addition , the reaction network includes a substrate , @xmath26 , from which monomers of both chiralities are generated : @xmath27 ; @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with @xmath31 a measure of the enzymatic fidelity .",
    "@xmath32 determine the enzymatic enhancement of chirally - pure @xmath33-handed monomers , and are assumed to depend on the length of the largest polymer in the reactor pool , @xmath34 , such that @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "other choices are possible , but lead to similar qualitative results @xcite .    given that the soai reaction @xcite - the most well  known illustration of an autocatalytic network leading to chiral purity - features dimers as catalysts @xcite , we focus on the truncated system for @xmath36 .",
    "we note that it is possible to make this truncation while maintaining the essential aspects of the dynamics leading to homochiralization @xcite .",
    "the reaction network is further simplified by assuming that the rate of change of the substrate , @xmath37 $ ] , and of the dimers , @xmath38 $ ] and @xmath39 $ ] , is much slower than that of the monomers , @xmath40 $ ] and @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "these approximations are known as the adiabatic elimination of rapidly adjusting variables @xcite and have been shown to produce a reliable approximation to the full ( @xmath42 ) sandars model @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless symmetric and asymmetric variables , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45(2 k_s/ q_s)^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath46(2 k_s/ q_s)^{1/2}$ ] , respectively @xcite . for @xmath47 , after a little algebra , the reaction network simplifies to @xmath48 where @xmath49 has the dimensions of inverse time .",

    "the chirality of the prebiotic soup might have been reset multiple times by significant environmental events such as active volcanism and meteoritic bombardment . under this view , the history of prebiotic chirality is interwoven with the earth s environmental history through a mechanism we call _ punctuated chirality _",

    "punctuated chirality is an extension of the the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis of eldredge and gould @xcite to prebiotic times .",
    "the theory of punctuated equilibrium describes evolutionary processes whereby speciation occurs through alternating periods of stasis and intense activity prompted by external influences : the punctuation is the geological moment when species arise which may be slow by human standards but is certainly abrupt by planetary standards as evidenced by the fossil record .",

    "it is commonly accepted that molecules undergo selective processes that lead to evolutionary adaptions ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore natural to extend the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis to the prebiotic realm . in this context , the concept of punctuated equilibrium is borrowed with some freedom : the network of chemical reactions described in prebiological systems is a non - equilibrium open system capable of exchanging energy with the environment .",
    "the periods of stasis that develop correspond to steady - states in that even though environmental influences may be negligible , chemical reactions are always occurring so as to keep the average concentrations of reactants at a near - constant value .    as an example of punctuated chirality in a prebiotic scenario , one can consider how repeated environmental interactions influence the evolution of chirality in the context of the model presented in the previous section . in fig .",

    "during the past decades , several biasing mechanisms have been proposed to explain life s remarkable homochirality .",
    "parity violation in weak neutral currents @xcite , if effective , would provide a universal bias : all amino acids found in the universe should be levorotatory .",
    "( although one would still need to explain why sugars are dextrorotatory . ) in contrast , circularly - polarized uv light @xcite , if produced in active star - forming regions , would act within a stellar system or , at most , within neighboring stellar systems _ without _ any uniform bias : in different star - forming regions across the galaxy , stellar systems should have stereochemistry with uncorrelated chirality .",
    "one of us has recently argued that  if relegated to diffusive processes  both mechanisms would probably be ineffective within the time - scales relevant for life s emergence on earth @xcite . in any case , the point we are making here is stronger : punctuated chirality would render _ any _ biasing mechanism ineffective : environmental events have the potential to restore chiral symmetry and thus to wash out previous values of chirality locally and , for events of great violence , globally .",
    "the same conclusion holds for the very different mechanism toward homochirality described in the last section , where no autocatalysis or enantiomeric excess is needed to amplify an initial bias ; instead , chiral - selective reaction rates alone can lead to substantial chiral excess .",
    "we noted that this chiral selectivity may also be prompted by environmental effects @xcite . both parity violation and circularly - polarized uv light predict that within the same stellar system , each planetary platform would have the same chiral bias .",
    "in contrast , environmentally - induced chiral selectivity is a local effect , that depends on the particular history of the planetary platform harboring life .",
    "we thus propose that it is possible to distinguish between the three mechanisms through future space missions aimed at studying stereochemistry @xcite .",
    "if chiral bias , as life on earth , goes through periods of stasis ( chemical steady state ) punctuated by violent upheavals and symmetry restoration , we predict that there would be no chiral correlations even within the same stellar system : the same amino acid found , say , in titan would not necessarily display the same chirality if found on earth or mars .",
    "of course , only a large enough statistical sample would resolve the issue .",
    "biological precursors certainly interacted with the primordial environment and may have had their chirality reset multiple times before homochiral life first evolved . in this case ,",
    "separate domains of molecular assemblies with randomly set chirality may have reacted in different ways to environmental disturbances .",
    "a final , earth - wide homochiral prebiotic chemistry would have been the result of multiple interactions between neighboring chiral domains @xcite in an abiotic process that mimics natural selection .",
