    "when an electron in the bottom of the conduction band of a polar semiconductor moves , its coulomb field displaces the positive and negative ions with respect to each other producing polarization field .",
    "the electron with the associated phonon cloud is known as a polaron .",
    "the density oscillation in a medium creates plasmons .",
    "the interaction between an electron and plasmons can be described by frlich hamiltonian .",
    "the interaction of the electron with plasmon cloud is termed as the plasmapolaron .",
    "the binding energy is shifted and electron mass in enhanced .",
    "the frhlich polaron results when the interaction between electron and longitudinal optic ( lo ) phonon is described in the frhlich form characterized by the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "the polaron in an undoped polar material calculated with the unscreened electron - phonon interaction is termed as a single - polaron .    in the weak coupling limit @xmath1 ,",
    "the perturbation theory is applied to calculate ground state energies and effective masses of the single - polaron in three - dimensional ( 3d ) polar materials@xcite , two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum well ( qw ) structures@xcite and one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum wire structures@xcite .",
    "the polaron properties were also calculated in the multidimensional space @xmath2 where the space has an integer dimension @xmath3 . in the @xmath4 space , the expressions for the ground state energy and effective mass",
    "were correctly expressed in terms of @xmath3 in the weak@xcite , intermediate@xcite and strong coupling@xcite limits . since",
    "the coulomb interaction in fourier method is divergent in the 1d systems , the multidimensional method fails to calculate polaron properties in the quantum wire structures .",
    "therefore , the multidimensional space method finds the polaron properties in 2d and 3d systems quite accurately .",
    "when the width of the qw is extremely narrow and the barrier potential that causes the in - plane confinement is infinite , the system is purely 2d .",
    "the dimension increses monotonically with the increase of the well width and the infinitely wide well exhibits the three - dimensional ( 3d ) behaviour . in a finite qw with narrow well width",
    ", the electron envelope function spreads into the barrier region partially restoring the 3d characteristics of the system .",
    "the properties of the qw are determined by the parameters of the barrier materials . in the qw with large well width",
    ", the properties of the polaron are calculated taking the bulk values of the well material .",
    "this has been demonstrated in the calculation of exciton binding energy@xcite and polaron properties as a function of well width@xcite .",
    "consequently , the qw with finite well width and barrier height shows fractional dimensional behaviour @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",
    "the anisotropic interactions in an anisotropic solid are treated as ones in an isotropic fractional dimensional space , where the dimension is determined by the degree of anisotropy .",
    "thus only a single parameter known as the degree of dimensionality @xmath7 is needed to describe the system .",
    "the fractional dimensional space is not a vector space and the coordinates in this space are termed as _ pseudocoordinates_@xcite .",
    "the fractional dimensional space method has been applied to study exciton , biexciton , magnetoexciton and impurity states .",
    "the single - polaron binding energy and effective mass in the weak coupling limit have been derived in rectangular and parabolic qws .",
    "the results are found to increase with decreasing confinemnt .",
    "when the carrier density is high , the electron - phonon interaction is dynamically screened by the frequency dependent dielectric function and the resulting polaron is termed as the many - polaron . however , for systems with much larger plasma frequency than the lo phonon frequency , the static dielectric function can also be a good approximation .",
    "this happens when the carrier density is very high in the system .",
    "the properties of many - polaron in the doped zns was studied by da costa and studart@xcite including exchange - correlation effects beyond rpa and found that the ground state energies and effective masses are influenced by the exchange - correlation effects .",
    "the static properties such as the binding energy and optical conductivity have been studied by including the dynamical scrrening method .",
    "the effective mass of the polaron has been found from the optical conductivity .",
    "the results are markedly different from those calculated using the static dielectric function@xcite .    in the present work we study the many - polaron system by the static and dynamically screened electron - phonon interaction and electron - electron interaction .",
