    "<S> the main characteristic of photons carrying oam is their twisted wavefront characterized by @xmath1 phase term , where @xmath2 is an integer and @xmath3 is the azimuthal coordinate  @xcite . in the context of quantum information </S>",
    "<S> , oam states of photons have the particular advantage of representing quantum states belonging to an infinitely large , but discrete , hilbert space  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finite sub - spaces of dimensions @xmath0 can be considered as laboratory realizations of photonic qudits . in this study </S>",
    "<S> , we adopt the oam degree of freedom of single photons to achieve high - dimensional quantum cloning and performing quantum hacking on a high - dimensional quantum communication channel . </S>",
    "<S> although perfect cloning of unknown quantum states is forbidden  @xcite , it is interesting to ask ` how similar to the initial quantum state the best possible quantum clone can be ? ' </S>",
    "<S> the answer is given in terms of the cloning fidelity @xmath4 , which is defined as the overlap between the initial state to be cloned and that of the cloned copies . </S>",
    "<S> this figure of merit is a significant measure of the accuracy of a cloned copy obtained from a specific cloner . </S>",
    "<S> schemes that achieve the best possible fidelity are called optimal quantum cloning , and play an important role in quantum information  @xcite . for instance </S>",
    "<S> , an optimal state estimation yields a bounded fidelity of @xmath5 , where @xmath0 is the dimension of the quantum state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> optimal quantum cloning turns out to be a more efficient way of broadcasting the quantum state of a single system as it yields a fidelity that is always higher than that of optimal state estimation , which has been experimentally realized for low dimensional photonic states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this enhancement in fidelity grows larger with higher dimensional quantum states , further motivating experimental investigations of high - dimensional quantum cloning . </S>",
    "<S> hence , high - dimensional optimal quantum cloning machines are of great importance whenever quantum information is to be transmitted among multiple individuals without knowledge of the input quantum state . here </S>",
    "<S> , we concentrate on the @xmath6 universal optimal quantum cloning machine , for which the optimal fidelity of the two cloned copies is given by @xmath7 , where @xmath0 is the dimension of the hilbert space of the states that are to be cloned  @xcite .     </S>",

    "<S> the cloning machine consist of a delay line ( dl ) , to adjust the arrival time of the input photon , a second photon that is in a completely mixed state when exiting slm - b and a first beam splitter ( bs1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two photons are made to arrive at the beam splitter simultaneously using the dl . </S>",
    "<S> the two photons exiting one of the output port of the first beam splitter together are further separated at a second beam splitter ( bs2 ) , and are sent out of the cloning machine . </S>",
    "<S> the cloned photons are then detected and characterized using detectors ( d1 and d2 ) and spatial light modulators ( slm - c and slm - d ) , respectively . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we use the symmetrization method to realize a universal optimal quantum cloning machine for high - dimensional oam states  @xcite . in this method , the quantum state that is to be cloned , namely @xmath8 , </S>",
    "<S> is sent in one of the input port of a non - polarizing beam splitter . in the other input port </S>",
    "<S> , a completely mixed state of the appropriate dimension , given by @xmath9 , is sent , where @xmath10 is the @xmath0-dimensional identity matrix . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , when both input photons are interfering at the beam splitter , two `` cloned '' photons will jointly exit one of the output ports . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this cloning scheme does not require knowledge of the input state and applies to any arbitrary state . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this property is a result of the `` universality '' of the cloning machine and shows the versatility of our scheme . </S>",
    "<S> each output cloned photon s state is represented by a reduced density matrix obtained by tracing over the other photon . </S>",
    "<S> since both cloned photons are characterized by an identical cloned state , the cloner is then said to be `` symmetric '' . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the symmetrization method is considered to be a symmetric optimal universal quantum cloning machine ( uqcm ) . in our experiment </S>",
    "<S> we implement a high - dimensional version of this uqcm with oam states of single photons ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> we evaluate the cloning fidelity , @xmath14 , of a given arbitrary input state , @xmath15 , from the probability of finding both output cloned photons in the state @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> this probability can be obtained experimentally by means of coincidence measurements : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 represents the number of coincidence measurements between the states @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the total number of coincidence measurements , i.e. @xmath22 , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent elements of the basis containing @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the factor of 2 that appears in the definition of @xmath25 is a result of the symmetric nature of our cloning machine , where @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> further , one can obtain from normalization , @xmath27 , for @xmath28 .        </S>",
    "<S> compared to a full tomographic reconstruction , this method requires fewer measurements and thus enables us to characterize the cloning fidelity of our cloner under a wider range of circumstances . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the effect of dimensionality on a uqcm is a crucial point for any optimal cloning schemes . as mention previously , increasing the dimensionality of the input quantum states results in a decrease of the cloning fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , this decrease in cloning fidelity can serve as an intuitive explanation of the superiority of high - dimensional quantum cryptography . in our experiment </S>",
    "<S> we measure the cloning fidelity of our cloning machine for different input states belonging to the computational oam basis of various dimensions @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> we find near - perfect agreement of the experimentally evaluated cloning fidelities to the theoretical predictions of the high - dimensional @xmath30 symmetric optimal uqcm ( see fig  [ fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we experimentally verify the universality of our cloning machine by performing quantum cloning of every states of all @xmath31 oam mutually unbiased bases ( mubs )  @xcite ( see fig  [ fig3]-(a ) ) . once more , we find near optimal cloning fidelities for all mubs , thus demonstrating the viability and universality of our optimal quantum cloner ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that mubs and their elements are playing an important role in quantum communication and information , e.g. as basis states utilized in quantum cryptographic protocols  @xcite or quantum state tomography  @xcite . as a second series of measurements for a complete characterization of our uqcm </S>",
    "<S> , we fully reconstruct the high - dimensional cloned quantum states by means of quantum state tomography . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our uqcm should be able to clone the state regardless of the input state and its complex structure in the high - dimensional state space . </S>",
    "<S> an exemplary and visually interesting high - dimensional state is the so - called _ gaussian _ state given by the following superposition , @xmath32 </S>",
    "<S> | \\ell \\rangle$ ] , where @xmath33 is a normalization constant . </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally generate the gaussian state of dimension @xmath34 and perform full quantum state tomography on one of the output cloned photons . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretically expected and experimentally achieved results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]-(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cloned gaussian state has a fidelity @xmath35 with respect to the theoretically expected cloned density matrix . </S>",
    "<S> thus , </S>",
    "<S> for an arbitrary complex input state @xmath36 the experimental cloning fidelity of our uqcm obtained from complete quantum state tomography can be estimated to be around @xmath37 . in comparison to the fidelity for @xmath34 of 0.625 , which we evaluated from success probabilities , </S>",
    "<S> the lower value can be explained by preparation and detection errors , since full quantum state tomography requires a much larger number of measurements . </S>",
    "<S> however , both methods show that our implementation of a symmetric uqcm can be used to clone any arbitrarily complex quantum state up to dimension seven , without a significant loss or deterioration of the optimal state fidelities . </S>",
    "<S> hence , cloning of high - dimensional quantum states encoded in the oam degree of freedom might become a building block of future high - dimensional quantum information science .     </S>",
    "<S> available mubs . indeed , in the simpler case of the bb84 protocol , the optimal attack consists of the asymmetric fourier - covariant cloner  @xcite , which can not be straightforwardly implemented in our experimental setup . ]    as a final test of the abilities to clone high - dimensional quantum states , we implement a cloning attack into a high - dimensional quantum key distribution ( qkd ) scheme . in a qkd protocol , </S>",
    "<S> a sender ( alice ) and receiver ( bob ) use quantum states to distribute a random , secret key shared between both parties . </S>",
    "<S> the shared key is then use to communicate an encrypted message through a classical channel , using the perfectly secure one - time pad protocol . </S>",
    "<S> the security of qkd resides in the fact that the presence of an eavesdropper ( eve ) will result in the introduction of errors in the shared key , which can originate for example from the non - perfect but optimal cloning done by the eavesdropper . </S>",
    "<S> note that the dimensionality of the quantum states used to distribute the key affects directly the cloning fidelity and thus the amount of errors introduced by a possible cloning attack . </S>",
    "<S> we first perform a high - dimensional qkd using the seminal bb84 protocol  @xcite , extended using oam states of dimension @xmath34 , and then experimentally replicate the presence of an eavesdropper , having access to a high - dimensional optimal quantum cloning machine , performing an individual attack . in our experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the first mub is given by the logical oam basis @xmath38 and the second mub is given by the fourier angle basis @xmath39  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> projective measurements are shown with and without the cloning attack in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]-(a ) and ( b ) , respectively </S>",
    "<S> . the lower fidelity due to a cloning attack is readily visible . </S>",
    "<S> a visually compelling illustration of the effect of an eavesdropper on alice s and bob s shared key can be given by directly using the established raw sifted key , without further performing error correction and privacy amplification , as a one - time pad to share an encrypted message , e.g. an image of their favourite optical phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally simulate such a situation by performing the high - dimensional bb84 protocol with and without eve s attack by using our uqcm . in a real world qkd </S>",
    "<S> , experimental errors will always be introduced in the raw key , leading to a slightly deteriorated image after bob s decryption ( see fig  [ fig4]-(a ) ) . however , </S>",
    "<S> if eve performs her cloning attack while alice and bob are trying to establish their key , the errors increase significantly which is then directly visible in bob s decrypted image ( see fig  [ fig4]-(b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum bit error rate ( qber ) is given by 0.16 and 0.57 , without and with the cloning attack , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in the absence of an eavesdropper , the qber is well below the error bound for security in dimension 7 , i.e. @xmath40  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , error correction and privacy amplification may be performed in order for alice and bob to obtained a completely secure and errorless shared key . however , in the presence of the eavesdropper , the qber is well above the bound in dimension 7 , hence revealing immediately the presence of eve . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the mutual information between alice and bob may be calculated from @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is bob s error rate  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimental values of 1.73 and 0.36 bits per photons were obtained for alice and bob s mutual information with and without the cloning attack , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we performed quantum hacking to a 2-dimensional qkd protocol ( bb84 ) . in this case , the quantum bit error rate is given by , 0.19 and 0.007 , with and without the cloning attack , which is well above and below the security bound in dimension 2 , i.e. @xmath43 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it is clear that high - dimensional quantum cryptography leads to higher signal disturbance in the presence of an optimal cloning attack resulting in a larger tolerance to noise in the quantum channel . in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we showed the feasibility of high - dimensional optimal quantum cloning of orbital angular momentum states of single photons . </S>",
    "<S> this scheme was further employed to perform a cloning attack to a secure quantum channel , revealing the robustness of high - dimensional quantum cryptography upon quantum hacking . moreover , studying the effect of dimensionality and universality on optimal quantum cloning reveals its advantage over optimal state estimation in quantum information schemes where unknown quantum states must be distributed .    </S>",
