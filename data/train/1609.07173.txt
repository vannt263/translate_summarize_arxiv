    "theory of strong alfvnic turbulence ( goldreih and sridhar 1995 ) predicts that the turbulence cascades anisotropically , mainly toward large perpendicular wavenumbers @xmath2 ( small perpendicular scales @xmath3 ) across the mean magnetic field , @xmath4 .",
    "this prediction has been supported by observations of the solar - wind turbulence ( macbride & smith 2008 , and references therein ) . with growing @xmath2 the turbulent fluctuations become highly anisotropic , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , and their perpendicular scales approach the ion gyroradius @xmath7 . in this wavenumber range mhd alfvn waves ( aws ) transform into kinetic alfvn waves ( kaws ) ( hasegawa & chen 1976 ) .",

    "markovskii et al .",
    "( 2007 ) argued that the break wavenumber decreases with increasing amplitude at break , which again may be caused by the turbulence imbalance ( it is usually larger at larger amplitudes ) .",

    "we are not aware of such dedicated observations so far .",
    "podesta et al . (",

    "this and other kinetic damping effects were widely discussed as possible mechanisms absorbing turbulent cascades ( leamon et al .",

    "slight deviations from theoretical spectra ( @xmath13 / @xmath141 in the strong / weak turbulence ) can be attributed to intermittency ( boldyrev et al . 2012 ) and damping ( passot & sulem 2015 ) .",
    "zhao et al .",
    "( 2016 ) argued that damping modifies the spectral index by @xmath142 only .",
    "these observations suggest that the damping is not so strong as thought before",
    ". the reason can be particles feedback via quasi - linear diffusion ( e.g. pierrard & voitenko 2013 ) reducing velocity - space gradients and hence damping ( voitenko & goossens 2006 ) .",

    "the actual damping is not easy to evaluate as the detailed knowledge of the velocity distributions is required in every particular case .",
    "we thus focused on nonlinear dynamics ignoring the linear damping @xmath143 as compared to @xmath144 ( which seems also natural in view of the usual ordering @xmath145 @xmath146 @xmath147 in the critically balanced turbulence ) .",

    "both the spectral steepening and non - universality in wdr are much larger than in sdr and can hardly be caused by intermittency or damping without significant modification of nonlinear interactions .",
    "our theoretical results uphold the dominant role of the nonlinear interactions also in wdr , particularly due to their strengthening by co - collisions .    here",
