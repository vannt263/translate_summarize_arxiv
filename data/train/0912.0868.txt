    "interference alignment is a recently introduced technique to cope with the transmissions of interfering users in wireless systems see @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we apply this technique to obtain fairly precise ( up to @xmath3 factor ) information - theoretic scaling results for the unicast and multicast capacity regions of dense wireless networks .      the study of scaling laws for wireless networks , describing the system performance in the limit of large number of users ,",
    "was initiated by gupta and kumar in @xcite .",
    "they analyzed a network scenario in which @xmath0 nodes are placed uniformly at random on a square of area one ( called a _",
    "dense network _ in the following ) and are randomly paired into @xmath0 source - destination pairs with uniform rate requirement . under a so - called _ protocol channel model _ , in which only point - to - point communication is allowed and interference is treated as noise , they showed that the largest uniformly achievable per - node rate scales as @xmath4 up to a polylogarithmic factor in @xmath0 .",
    "achievability was shown using a multi - hop communication scheme combined with straight - line routing .",
    "different constructions achieving slightly better scaling laws , i.e. , improving the polylogarithmic factor in @xmath0 , were subsequently presented in @xcite .",
    "these results are in some sense negative , in that they show that with current technology , captured by the protocol channel model assumption , the per - node rate in large wireless networks decreases with increasing network size even if the deployment area is kept constant .",
    "an immediate question is therefore if this negative result is due to the protocol channel model assumption or if there is a more fundamental reason for it . to address this question ,",
    "several authors have considered an information - theoretic approach to the problem , in which the channel is simply assumed to be a gaussian fading channel without any restrictions on the communication scheme @xcite .",
    "we shall refer to this as the _ gaussian fading channel model _ in the following .",
    "these works construct cooperative communication schemes and show that they can significantly outperform multi - hop communication in dense networks .",
    "in particular , zgr et al",
    ". showed in @xcite that in gaussian fading dense wireless networks with randomly deployed nodes and random source - destination pairing , the maximal uniformly achievable per - node rate scales like is used to indicate that the maximal uniformly achievable per - node rate is upper bounded by @xmath5 and lower bounded by @xmath6 .",
    "similar expressions will be used throughout this section . ]",
    "@xmath7 for any @xmath8 .",
    "in other words , in dense networks nodes are placed on a square of area @xmath0 . here",
    "network performance depends on the _ path - loss exponent _ @xmath9 , governing the speed of decay of signal power as a function of distance . for small @xmath9 ,",
    "cooperative communication is order optimal , whereas for large @xmath9 , multi - hop communication is order optimal @xcite . ] , cooperative communication can increase achievable rates to almost constant scaling in @xmath0significantly improving the @xmath4 scaling resulting from the protocol channel model assumption .",
    "the @xmath7 scaling law was subsequently tightened to @xmath10 in @xcite .    while these results removed the protocol channel model assumption made in @xcite , they kept the assumptions of _ random _ node placement and _ random _ source - destination pairing with uniform rate .",
    "wireless networks with _ random _ node placement and _ arbitrary _ traffic pattern have been analyzed in @xcite for the protocol channel model and in @xcite for the gaussian fading channel model .",
    "on the other hand , wireless networks with _ arbitrary _ node placement and _ random _ source - destination pairing with uniform rate have been investigated in @xcite for the protocol channel model and in @xcite for the gaussian fading channel model . while methods similar to the ones developed in @xcite can also be used to analyze wireless networks with _ arbitrary _ node placement and _ arbitrary _ traffic pattern under the protocol channel model , the performance of such general networks under a gaussian channel model ( i.e. , an information - theoretic characterization of achievable rates ) is unknown .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning @xcite , which derive scaling laws for large dense interference networks . in particular",
    ", @xcite considers a dense random node placement with random source - destination pairing .",
    "however , the model there is an interference channel as opposed to a wireless network as modeled in the works mentioned above . in other words ,",
    "the source nodes can not communicate with each other , and similarly the destination nodes can not communicate with each other .",
    "this differs from the model adopted in this paper and the works surveyed so far , in which no such restrictions are imposed . for such interference networks",
    ", @xcite derives the asymptotic sum - rate as the number of nodes in the network increases .      in this paper",
    ", we consider the general problem of determining achievable rates in dense wireless networks with arbitrary node placement and arbitrary traffic pattern .",
    "we assume a gaussian fading channel model , i.e. , the analysis is information - theoretic , imposing no restrictions on the nature of communication schemes used .",
    "we analyze the @xmath11-dimensional unicast capacity region @xmath12 , and the @xmath2-dimensional multicast capacity region @xmath13 of an arbitrary dense wireless network .",
    "@xmath14 describes the collection of all achievable unicast traffic patterns ( in which each message is to be sent to only one destination node ) , while @xmath15 describes the collection of all achievable multicast traffic patterns ( in which each message is to be sent to a set of destination nodes ) .",
    "we provide explicit approximations @xmath16 and @xmath17 of @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the sense that @xmath18 for constants @xmath19 not depending on @xmath0 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 approximate the unicast and multicast capacity regions @xmath14 and @xmath15 up to a factor @xmath3 .",
    "this provides tight scaling results for arbitrary traffic pattern and arbitrary node placement .",
    "the results presented in this paper improve the known results in several respects .",
    "first , as already pointed out , they require no probabilistic modeling of the node placement or traffic pattern , but rather are valid for any node placement and any traffic pattern and include the results for random node placement and random source - destination pairing with uniform rate as a special case .",
    "second , they provide information - theoretic scaling results that are considerably tighter than the best previously known , namely up to a factor @xmath3 here as compared to @xmath5 in @xcite and @xmath20 in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the results in this paper provide an explicit expression for the pre - constant in the @xmath3 term that is quite small , and hence these bounds yield good results also for small and moderate sized wireless networks .",
    "third , the achievable scheme used to prove the inner bound in this paper is , at least conceptually , quite simple , in that the only cooperation needed between users is to perform interference alignment .",
    "this contrasts with the communication schemes achieving near linear scaling presented so far in the literature , which require hierarchical cooperation and are harder to analyze .",
