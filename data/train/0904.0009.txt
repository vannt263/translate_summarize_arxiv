    "the last decade has seen a revolution in our understanding of star formation in galaxies , driven by the advent of spatially resolved multi - wavelength surveys . prior to this work ,",
    "our observational constraints on the star formation process were largely limited to low resolution surveys that characterized entire galaxies using only a handful of observable quantities , e.g.  the mean surface density of star formation averaged over a whole disk . while these surveys yielded a number of intriguing results  most famously the @xcite star formation law ",
    "they left unanswered many basic questions about the physics of star formation .",
    "for example , they could not clearly determine whether star formation correlates more strongly with the molecular or total gas content of a galaxy @xcite , or whether star formation is regulated primarily by local processes within individual star - forming clouds ( e.g.  @xcite , hereafter ; @xcite ) or by galactic - scale processes such as spiral shocks , supernovae , or cloud - cloud interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "now , however , emission maps at 24 @xmath0 m from the _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxy survey ( sings ) provide us with accurate estimates of the rate of dust - enshrouded star formation at resolutions of better than a kpc in nearby galactic disks @xcite , while ultraviolet observations from the galex nearby galaxy survey ( ngs ) reveal the rates of non - obscured star formation with comparable resolution and accuracy @xcite .",
    "observations of h  i  emission from the vla as part of the h  i  nearby galaxy survey ( things ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and of co emission by the bima survey of nearby galaxies ( bima song ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the hera co - line extragalactic survey ( heracles ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using the 30 m iram telescope provide maps of the gas content of galaxies at comparable resolutions .",
    "combining these data sets leads to two particularly important conclusions that our theoretical models of star formation must incorporate and explain .",
    "the first observational result is that that star formation is a direct product of the molecular gas in a galaxy , not of all the gas . across a wide range of galactic environments",
    "the star formation rate correlates well with molecular gas , and poorly or not at all with the atomic gas measured on sub - kpc spatial scales ( @xcite , hereafter ) .",
    "the correlation between star formation rate and molecular gas surface density is super - linear in samples that extend to starbursts with gas surface densities @xmath1 @xmath2 pc@xmath3",
    "@xcite , but is nearly linear for galaxies with molecular surface densities from @xmath4 @xmath2 pc@xmath3 (; however , see @xcite for a different interpretation ) . observations of the low density outskirts of galactic disks hint that the linearity may break down there @xcite , but it is unclear if this indicates a change in the star formation process or a change in the co to h@xmath5 conversion factor .",
    "the second observational result is that giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) have remarkably similar properties in all nearby galaxies . across the local group gmcs",
    "appear to have the same surface density , roughly @xmath6 @xmath2 pc@xmath3 , and to obey the same linewidth - size relation @xcite .",
    "together these two observations imply that all observed molecular clouds are not far from virial balance between gravity and internal turbulence .",
    "there is of course considerable uncertainty in the gmc surface density , arising mostly from the co - to - h@xmath5 conversion factor , but it is striking that there is no clear evidence of a systematic trend in gmc properties across a sample of galaxies ranging from h  i - dominated dwarfs to molecule - rich giant spirals .",
    "this seems to be a critical clue to the physics of molecular clouds .",
    "efforts to incorporate these observational results and their implications into numerical simulations are already underway . @xcite and @xcite present calculations of galaxy evolution that include models for the chemistry of hydrogen molecule formation and destruction , and",
    "that restrict star formation to occur only in molecular gas .",
    "@xcite use high resolution simulations of galactic disks to study the origin of the observed properties of gmcs .",
    "our goal in this paper is to complement and extend this work by developing a simple analytic model for the star formation law that is based on the insights provided by the new observational surveys , and that incorporates the theoretical understanding that has developed around them .",
    "our basic approach is to break the problem into three tractable pieces , each of which can be treated using models and observations already available in the literature .",
    "the first is the problem of calculating what fraction of the gas in a given portion of a galaxy will be in the molecular phase and thus eligible to form stars .",
    "the problem of determining the molecular fraction in the ism has been treated extensively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; in our approach we will adopt the model of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kmt08 and kmt09 ) , which agrees very well with the observations of molecular fractions reported by @xcite and @xcite , and has the advantage that it does not depend on unknown and generally unmeasurable quantities such as the intensity of the ultraviolet radiation field inside a galaxy .",
    "the second problem is to estimate the characteristic properties of the gmcs in a galaxy , which can be done using a combination of their observed properties simple arguments based on virial balance and the galactic jeans mass ( e.g.  @xcite ; ) .",
    "the third problem is to estimate the rate at which molecular clouds of known properties transform themselves into stars .",
    "this rate is known from observations to be @xmath7 of the mass per free - fall time @xcite , a value that can be understood theoretically as a result of regulation of star formation by supersonic turbulence ( @xcite ; ; @xcite ) . in   [ sflawsec ]",
    "we explain how these three components can be combined to produce a star formation law , and then in   [ obscomp ] we compare the results to observations .",
    "given that star formation occurs in molecular gas , we formulate our theoretical law for the local star formation rate ( sfr ) surface density @xmath8 in a galaxy as a product of three factors : @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the total gas surface density at some point in the galaxy . in practice",
    "this will always be an average over some size scale , determined by the resolution of observations ( or simulations ) .",
    "this determines the total available  raw material \" for star formation .",
    "the factor @xmath11 is the fraction of this mass in molecular form ; atomic gas does not participate in star formation .",
    "the molecular component of the gas is organized into clouds which have some mean volume density @xmath12 , and @xmath13^{1/2}$ ] is the free - fall time at this mean density .",
    "the quantity @xmath14 is the dimensionless star formation rate ; it is the fraction of the gas transformed into stars per free - fall time .",
    "alternately , one may think of it as the star formation efficiency over one free - fall time ( as opposed to the total star formation efficiency , which might mean the fraction of gas transformed into stars over some other timescale , such as the galactic rotation time or the lifetime of an individual gmc ) .",
    "the third factor , @xmath15 , is simply the sfr per free - fall time divided by the free - fall time , which is the inverse of the time required to convert all of the gas into stars . to make a model for the star formation law , we must estimate @xmath11 , @xmath16 , and @xmath14 in terms of the observable quantities for a galaxy .",
    "the molecular mass fraction @xmath11 is determined by the balance between dissociation of molecules by the far ultraviolet ( fuv ) interstellar radiation field in the lyman - werner bands and formation of molecules on the surfaces of dust grains . and show that to good approximation @xmath11 within a single atomic - molecular complex is a function of the gas surface density of the complex @xmath17 and the metallicity @xmath18 .",
    "we will not repeat the full derivation of this result here , but a summary of the calculation that produces it is that one first solves the idealized problem of finding where the transition between the atomic envelope and the molecular interior occurs within a uniform sphere of hydrogen gas and dust embedded in an isotropic dissociating radiation field .",
    "this analysis shows that the fraction of the complex in molecular form depends on the dust optical depth of the complex @xmath19 and on the dimensionless ratio @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the dust cross section per hydrogen nucleus , @xmath22 is the intensity of the dissociating radiation field , @xmath23 is the number density of gas in the cold atomic medium that surrounds the molecular part of the cloud , and @xmath24 is the rate coefficient for h@xmath5 formation on the surfaces of dust grains .",
    "since @xmath21 and @xmath24 are both , to first order , simply measures of the total amount of dust in a galaxy , their ratio should not vary widely between galaxies .",
    "similarly , in a galaxy with a two - phase atomic medium the cold atomic gas density @xmath23 is determined by thermal pressure balance between the two phases , which in turn depends on the balance between heating by fuv photons and atomic line cooling in the atomic gas .",
    "analysis of these processes implies that the ratio @xmath25 is a weak function of metallicity and is otherwise independent of galaxy properties @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath26 varies little between galaxies , and this result enables us to write the molecular fraction for a given atomic - molecular complex as a function solely of its gas surface density @xmath17 and its metallicity @xmath18 : @xmath27^{-1/5}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the metallicity normalized to the solar value .",
    "note that this approximation is slightly different with the one given in ; the two agree to within a few percent for clouds that are substantially molecular , but this one is more accurate at small molecular fractions ( mckee , krumholz , & tumlinson , 2009 , in preparation ) .",
    "here @xmath17 is the surface density of a @xmath33 pc - sized atomic - molecular complex .",
    "however , extragalactic observations generally measure a gas surface density @xmath10 that is averaged over a much larger scale .",
    "since @xmath11 increases super - linearly with @xmath17 , clumping of the gas on scales below the observational resolution would lead us to underpredict @xmath11 if we were simply to use the large - scale - averaged value of @xmath10 in place of @xmath17 equation ( [ fmolapprox ] ) . since we wish to propose a model that is applicable to data and simulations at a range of resolutions , it is convenient to approximately correct for this effect by letting @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a clumping factor and @xmath36 as the resolution approaches @xmath33 pc .    as a final caveat ,",
    "it is important to point that our calculation of @xmath11 in assumes that the @xcite semi - analytic model for the atomic ism is applicable , and the model begins to break down at metallicities below roughly 5% of solar ( see figure 13 of @xcite ) because dust grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons begin to be neutral rather than positively charged , as the model assumes .",
    "turbulent heating of the cold h  i  phase @xcite , which is not included in the @xcite models , is also likely to be important at low metallicity .",
    "thus , although our general method of calculating molecular fractions will apply even at low metallicities , the relationship between @xmath23 and @xmath22 which is used to derive equation ( [ fmolapprox ] ) is not valid at metallicities @xmath37 .",
    "next we must compute @xmath16 and @xmath14 , which will depend on the properties of the star - forming gmcs in a galaxy . before proceeding with such a calculation",
    ", we note that observations of local group galaxies indicate that in galaxies ranging from metal - poor dwarfs to molecule - rich spirals , the molecular cloud surface density @xmath38 @xmath2 pc@xmath3 and the molecular cloud virial ratio @xmath39 independent of galactic environment @xcite .",
    "is lower than the @xmath40 @xmath2 pc@xmath3 for galactic gmcs found by @xcite , but is consistent with the lower value determined by the more recent survey of @xcite . ]",
    "this invariance is reasonably easy to understand on theoretical grounds .",
    "the virial theorem implies that the mean pressure within the cloud is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 . in comparison , @xcite find that the mean kinetic pressure in the ism of a milky way - like galaxy is @xmath43 k @xmath44 , an order of magnitude lower , although the pressure may be higher than average in spiral arms where gmcs form .",
    "the pressure is almost certainly lower in low surface - density dwarfs .",
    "the mismatch between the pressures in gmcs and the pressures in their environments indicates that external pressure is at most marginally important in determining the properties of molecular clouds , and that gmcs must instead be internally regulated ; in effect , a gmc forgets about its galactic environment .",
    "moreover , such a picture provides a quantitative explanation for the observed values of the gmc surface density and virial ratio .",
    "the dominant mechanism of internal regulation is h  ii region feedback @xcite , a process whose efficiency depends on the column density of the cloud .",
    "@xcite find that h  ii regions stabilize gmcs at column densities of roughly @xmath45 @xmath2 pc@xmath3 and virial ratios @xmath46 , consistent within the uncertainties with the observed values .",
    "the constant surface densities and virial ratios of gmcs provide a natural way to estimate @xmath16 and @xmath14 .",
    "consider a gmc of mass @xmath47 , surface density @xmath48 , and virial ratio @xmath49 .",
    "the volume density in this cloud is @xmath50 , so the free - fall time is @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "similarly , show that the star formation rate per free - fall time in a turbulent medium is approximately @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the 1-d mach number of the turbulence and @xmath55 is the fraction of the mass in a gravitationally - bound prestellar core that is incorporated into a star rather than being ejected by protostellar outflows .",
    "adopt @xmath56 based on analytic models showing @xmath57 @xcite ; more recent work suggests the true value is @xmath58 @xcite , so we adopt @xmath59 .",
    "the virial ratio is related to the one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath60 in a gmc by @xmath61 @xcite , so @xmath62 km s@xmath63 . and",
    "@xmath64 , this agrees with the observed linewidth - size relation @xmath65 km s@xmath63 @xcite to within the error bars . ] for a molecular cloud temperature of 10 k the corresponding mach number is @xmath66 , so @xmath67 this is consistent with the observed value @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "combining equations ( [ tffeqn ] ) and ( [ sfrffeqn1 ] ) , and adopting a fiducial value of @xmath64 , gives @xmath69    the invariance of molecular cloud properties that we observe in nearby galaxies must break down in galaxies with sufficiently high surface densities , where the external pressure is no longer negligible compared to a gmc s internal pressure . since pressure varies as @xmath70 for both molecular clouds and galactic disks , the galactic environment will become significant in determining molecular cloud properties once the galactic surface density averaged over large scales becomes comparable to the surface density of an individual gmc . in this case",
    "the gmc surface density must increase in order to maintain pressure balance with the rest of the galaxy s ism , which simply requires that @xmath71 for @xmath72 @xmath2 pc@xmath3 .",
    "( alternately , @xcite suggest that a change in gmc properties might be expected when @xmath73 @xmath2 pc@xmath3 because at such high surface densities collisions between gmcs become common . )",
    "observations are consistent with this hypothesis : in the central kpc of m64 , where the galactic surface density runs from @xmath74 @xmath2 pc@xmath3 , the gmc surface density is not constant , and instead rises with galactic pressure . averaged over the entire galaxy the mean gmc surface density is @xmath75 @xmath2 pc@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "thus , the free - fall time in gmcs in high surface density galaxies varies as @xmath76 .",
    "if we adopt a column density of @xmath77 @xmath2 pc@xmath3 for all gmcs in normal surface density galaxies and @xmath78 at higher galactic surface densities , then we have @xmath79.\\ ] ]    equation ( [ sfrfftff1 ] ) gives an estimate for @xmath15 in a molecular cloud of a known mass . to complete the calculation",
    ", we must estimate the characteristic molecular cloud mass in a galaxy .",
    "we follow in estimating that this will be determined by the jeans mass in the galaxy , which is @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the gas velocity dispersion , @xmath82 is the toomre @xmath82 of the galactic disk , and @xmath83 is the angular velocity of its rotation .",
    "if we can directly measure @xmath10 , @xmath83 , and @xmath82 , or @xmath10 and @xmath81 , for a galaxy , then we can solve for @xmath47 directly and substitute into equation ( [ sfrfftff1 ] ) to obtain a characteristic value of @xmath15 for that galaxy .",
    "however , often one or more of the quantities are unknown , and even when they are known it is useful to have a rough estimate in terms of a single quantity such as @xmath10 rather than three quantities @xmath10 , @xmath83 , and @xmath82 .",
    "since @xmath84 enters the star formation rate only to the @xmath85 power , any errors we make in this approximation are unlikely to have strong effects .",
    "we therefore follow in assuming that all galaxies will be marginally toomre stable , @xmath86 , and noting that there is broad statistical correlation @xmath87 . if we use this correlation in ( [ mcleq ] )",
    "then we obtain @xmath88    finally , it is worth noting here that our estimate of the molecular cloud volume density , which depends on @xmath89 and @xmath84 , is somewhat different than that of .",
    "they assumed that gmc surface densities were set largely by external pressure in a galaxy , and computed the density based on this assumption .",
    "as discussed above , more recent observational and theoretical work suggests that instead gmc densities are primarily set by internal feedback processes and do not vary significantly with galactic conditions , at least in milky way - like galaxies .",
    "our model in this paper takes this result into account .",
    "we have now derived the major components of our star formation law ( equation [ sfreq1 ] ) .",
    "the molecular fraction @xmath11 depends only on gas surface density @xmath10 , metallicity @xmath32 , and the clumping of the gas @xmath90 on scales unresolved in a given observation or simulation ( equation [ fmolapprox ] ) .",
    "it increases with @xmath10 , becoming fully molecular at @xmath91 @xmath2 pc@xmath3 .",
    "we have also derived an analytic relation for the inverse star formation timescale @xmath15 in two regimes . where internal gmc pressure far exceeds the ambient ism gas pressure and gmcs  forget \" their environment  as typically occurs in nearby galaxies with @xmath92 @xmath2 pc@xmath3  this timescale does not depend on @xmath10 except indirectly through the molecular cloud mass ( equation [ mcleq1 ] ) . above @xmath93 @xmath2 pc@xmath3 ,",
    "ambient pressure becomes comparable to the gmc internal pressure and the star formation timescale depends on @xmath10 ( equation [ sfrfftff1 ] ) . in neither case does the timescale depend on either the metallicity or the clumping , so the star formation rate in molecular gas does not depend on either of these quantities .",
    "only the star formation rate in total gas does .",
    "we are now ready to combine these pieces into our single star formation law : @xmath94",
    "we compare our proposed star formation law , equation ( [ sfreq2 ] ) , to the observed relationship between star formation , atomic gas , and molecular gas in figures [ sflaw1 ] and [ sflaw2 ] .",
    "the majority of the observations come from the things sample .",
    "the full sample covers metallicities from @xmath95 to @xmath96 ( @xcite ; ) , but only four of the thirty - four galaxies have metallicities below @xmath97 , and these are all dwarfs with such low star formation rates that they contribute negligibly to the total star formation rate in the sample .",
    "moreover , the molecular gas masses for these systems are likely to be extremely uncertain ( see below ) . thus we adopt @xmath97 to @xmath98 as a realistic range of metallicities in the data .",
    "the things sample is observed at a resolution of @xmath99 pc , much larger than a single atomic - molecular complex , so we expect @xmath100 . the true value of @xmath90 can not be determined directly in external galaxies without higher resolution observations .",
    "a lower limit comes from the fact that the observations mix together spiral arm and inter - arm regions , and the arm - interarm density contrast is @xmath101 in galaxies observed at higher resolution @xcite .",
    "the complexes themselves represent density peaks on top of the already - enhanced density within the arm , and in fully molecular regions clouds are observed to have surface densities higher than the mean by a factor of @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath103 , and thus we expect the data to be characterized by @xmath104 to @xmath105 , with the four low - metallicity dwarfs lying at somewhat lower @xmath106 .",
    "our simple model recovers a number of salient features in the observations .",
    "figure [ sflaw1]a shows that we recover the observational result that the h  i  surface density reaches a maximum value , which is @xmath107 @xmath2 pc@xmath3 at solar metallicity , and that the star formation rate does not correlate well with @xmath108 in resolved observations of galaxies .",
    "the rms noise in the star formation rate surface density in the survey is @xmath109 @xmath2 kpc@xmath3 @xcite , so the apparent flattening of the contours below this value is an observational artifact .",
    "figure [ sflaw1]b indicates that we recover a good approximation to the correct , nearly constant star formation rate in molecular gas at surface densities from roughly @xmath4 @xmath2 pc@xmath3 .",
    "combined , these two effects produce a star formation rate that increases superlinearly with total gas content below the h  i  saturation threshold and only linearly above it ( figure [ sflaw1]c ) .",
    "third , we recover the return to a superlinear increase of star formation rate with total gas content above @xmath33 @xmath2 pc@xmath3 , produced by the increase in molecular cloud density in high - pressure environments ( figure [ sflaw2 ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the observations are subject to significant systematic errors in both the gas surface density and in the star formation rate , and that this is likely to limit the extent of agreement between the data and any theoretical model , including this one .",
    "the main uncertainty in the gas surface density is in the factor @xmath110 used to convert an observed co intensity into a molecular cloud mass .",
    "the standard assumption of a constant @xmath111 cm@xmath3 @xmath113 is likely to be accurate to a factor of @xmath102 in spiral galaxy environments , where its value has been calibrated against other methods of estimating mass @xcite . in low metallicity dwarf galaxies , however , there is evidence that the assumption of a fixed @xmath110 may underestimate the true molecular mass by as much as a factor of @xmath107 @xcite , while in starburst systems it may overestimate the mass by factors of up to @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "the variation of @xmath110 in starbursts has been at least approximately accounted for in the high @xmath10 systems shown in figure [ sflaw2 ] , but the uncertainty there is probably larger than for spiral galaxies . for dwarf systems at low metallicity , on the other hand , the values of @xmath10 and @xmath115 in figures [ sflaw1 ] and [ sflaw2 ] have for the most part been derived assuming a constant @xmath110 , and thus the possible systematic underestimate of @xmath10 and @xmath115 has not been included .",
    "this would tend to shift points to the right in figure [ sflaw1]c and figure 2 .",
    "the effect in figure [ sflaw1]b will be minimal , because most of the galaxies for which this effect is significant fall below the completeness limit in any event .",
    "uncertainties in the star formation rates come from a combination of uncertainties in dust corrections and in the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) . comparing star formation rates in the things sample based on fuv plus 24 @xmath0 m emission to those based on h@xmath116 , or h@xmath116 plus 24 @xmath0 m emission ,",
    "suggests uncertainties below the factor of @xmath102 level .",
    "comparison to the star formation rate in the milky way inferred from radio catalogs of h  ii regions suggests a slightly larger uncertainty : @xcite infer a star formation timescale in the molecular gas of @xmath117 myr from this technique , compared to 2 gyr for the average of the things sample .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is unclear , but it suggests that significant caution is warranted in interpreting the star formation rates inferred from observations .",
    "it is important to understand how our results here relate to previous work on star formation laws , both phenomenological and theoretical .",
    "our new star formation law , equation ( [ sfreq2 ] ) , is more complex than the simple @xcite powerlaw @xmath118 , with @xmath119 , and the related observational correlation between the co and infrared luminosities of galaxies ( assumed to be proxies for the molecular gas mass and the star formation rate , respectively ) reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "such increased complexity is demanded by improving observations , since the data shown in figures [ sflaw1 ] and [ sflaw2 ] clearly can not be fit by single powerlaws .",
    "there are very distinct regions where the relationship between @xmath120 and @xmath10 is steep , flattens , and then steepens again .",
    "that said , our model is in fact consistent with the data set on which the @xcite law is based ",
    "these are shown by the green open and filled triangles in figure [ sflaw2 ]  and these data in turn fall within the contours of the things observations . thus there is no inconsistency in the data themselves .",
    "why then is it possible to fit the data of the @xcite sample with a single powerlaw ?",
    "the answer comes partly from the fact that the data are averaged over entire galaxies , which introduces significant scatter compared to the more recent data that is resolved to sub - kpc scales .",
    "the primary reason for the single powerlaw kennicutt fit with an index of @xmath121 , however , is that most of the dynamic range in @xmath10 that gives rise to the index of @xmath122 comes from galaxies with @xmath123 @xmath2 pc@xmath3 .",
    "the same is true of the observed correlation between co and ir luminosities in galaxies , where most of the dynamic range in the sample comes from starbursts with large surface densities and star formation rates . in this regime",
    "our predicted law , equation ( [ sfreq2 ] ) , also reduces to a simple powerlaw @xmath124 ; the index @xmath125 is well within the error bars in kennicutt s fit .",
    "conversely , a fit to only the normal galaxies in kennicutt s sample produces a much steeper best - fit index of @xmath126 , consistent with the steeper slope we predict for normal galaxies due to the dependence of the h@xmath5 fraction on @xmath10 .",
    "thus the classic single powerlaw star formation law is in part an artifact of fitting a single powerlaw between normal galaxies and starbursts , a point also made by @xcite and @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the classical explanation for the observed @xmath127 and @xmath128 correlations with @xmath129 is that the star formation rate should be proportional to the gas mass divided by the free - fall time @xcite .",
    "the latter varies as density to the @xmath130 power , so in a parcel of gas of density @xmath131 the star formation rate per unit volume varies as @xmath132 .",
    "the model we propose here is entirely consistent with this basic picture , and with earlier explanations for correlations between star formation rates and gas masses and surface densities by and @xcite , despite the fact that we obtain a nearly linear correlation between @xmath120 and @xmath115 for @xmath133 @xmath2 pc @xmath3 .",
    "the reason we can obtain a linear correlation between @xmath120 and @xmath115 is that , in any theory in which the star formation timescale is proportional to the free - fall time , the star formation rate per unit area will vary as @xmath134 . similarly",
    "that the total star formation rate in a galaxy will vary as @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the total mass of molecular gas .",
    "the indices @xmath137 and @xmath138 for the areal and total star formation laws therefore depend on how @xmath131 varies with @xmath115 and @xmath136 , respectively .",
    "the most common assumption in previous work has been to adopt @xmath139 ( e.g.  @xcite ) and @xmath140 , but this assumption is independent of the basic idea that the star formation rate varies inversely with the free - fall time . indeed , if the characteristic densities of star - forming clouds do not vary from galaxy to galaxy , as is approximately ( though not exactly ) the case in our model for galaxies with @xmath92 @xmath2 , then we expect a linear relationship between @xmath120 and @xmath115 , even though the underlying volumetric star formation law is nonlinear .",
    "@xcite obtain a linear relationship between the luminosities of galaxies in the infrared and in hcn(@xmath141 ) emission for much the same reason .",
    "they point out that the high critical density of the hcn line ensures that it traces gas at similar densities in every galaxy , at least up to the most extreme starbursts . since @xmath131 is constant , the star formation law is linear . in our model here",
    "@xmath131 is roughly constant in galaxies with @xmath142 @xmath2 pc@xmath3 for a different reason ",
    "gmc densities are unaffected by galactic environment because gmc pressures greatly exceed mean ism pressures  but the end result , a linear star formation law , is the same .",
    "conversely , a scaling law @xmath143 or @xmath144 is expected when the characteristic density of the molecular gas scales close to linearly with its surface density or total mass . in our model",
    "such a scaling appears in the starburst regime because ism pressure becomes important in setting gmc internal densities .",
    "our model makes distinct predictions that can be tested against future observations .",
    "one obvious prediction is the upward kink in the relationship between @xmath120 and @xmath115 , or @xmath120 and @xmath10 , seen at @xmath145 @xmath2 pc@xmath3 ( figures 1a , 1b , and 2 ) .",
    "this kink in our model is caused by the transition between molecular cloud surface densities being determined by internal regulation and being determined by external pressure .",
    "a spatially resolved survey such as things targeting the nearest circumnuclear starburst galaxies such as m64 , which reach surface densities in the range @xmath74 @xmath2",
    "pc@xmath3 @xcite , should reveal this kink quite clearly , perhaps even within a single galaxy .",
    "the one caveat is that locating the kink depends on being able to measure molecular surface densities accurately , which in turn depends on our knowledge of the x factor used to convert co intensity to surface density .",
    "uncertainties in its value translate directly into uncertainties in the location of the kink in the star formation law .",
    "a second testable prediction comes from our predicted metallicity - dependence of the relationship between @xmath120 and @xmath10 ( figure 1c ) .",
    "our model curves span the range of metallicities covered by the things sample , and , as of the date of this paper s submission , a version of the data shown in figure 1 binned by metallicity was not available",
    ". however , such metallicity binning should reveal that low metallicity galaxies have systematically lower star formation rates at fixed @xmath10 for galaxies when @xmath146 @xmath2 pc@xmath3 .",
    "because there is degeneracy between the metallicity @xmath32 and the clumping factor @xmath90 , ideally this prediction would be tested with higher resolution observations that reduce or remove the need to adopt a clumping factor to account for the structure of the gas on scales unresolved by the observations . surveying a large sample of entire galactic disks with @xmath33 pc resolution , so that @xmath147 , is probably prohibitively expensive with the current generation of telescopes .",
    "however , even a random sample of sightlines through galaxies at varying @xmath10 and metallicity , with @xmath33 pc resolution , should be sufficient to test for a metallcity - dependent correlation between star formation rate and gas surface density such as the one we predict .",
    "we have shown that the observed relationship between the star formation rate and the atomic and molecular content of galaxies can be explained by a simple model , whose elements are summarized by the regions labelled in figure [ sflaw2 ] .",
    "first , self - shielding of hydrogen determines the amount of gas in molecular form .",
    "this imposes a characteristic gas surface density of @xmath91 @xmath2 pc@xmath3 for the transition from atomic to molecular , where @xmath90 is the factor by which the gas surface density is increased due to clumping unresolved by the observations and @xmath32 is the metallicity relative to solar .",
    "second , once molecules do form , molecular clouds reach a surface density of roughly @xmath6 @xmath2 pc@xmath3 independent of galactic environment .",
    "this behavior can be understood as arising from the fact that molecular clouds are overpressured relative to their surroundings , so they must be regulated by internal processes , most likely h  ii regions @xcite , that do not depend on metallicity or other large - scale galaxy properties .",
    "the constant surface density imposes a roughly constant volume density and free - fall time on all molecular gas .",
    "the exception to this is galaxies where the mean galactic surface density is @xmath148 @xmath2 pc@xmath3 , in which the ambient pressure is high enough to force gmc densities to rise along with galactic surface density in order to keep the clouds in pressure balance .",
    "third , once formed molecular clouds convert themselves into stars at a nearly universal rate of @xmath7 of the mass per free - fall time as a result of turbulent regulation . together",
    "these effects produce a total gas star formation law that is superlinear at low galactic column density ( due to increasing molecular fraction ) , linear or slightly sub - linear at intermediate column ( due to the invariance of molecular cloud surface densities and the weak dependence of gmc masses on galactic properties ) , and superlinear again at high column ( due to the breakdown of this invariance at high galactic pressures ) .",
    "it is worth noting that our model does not make any explicit reference to galactic - scale processes such as spiral shocks , gravitational instability , supernova feedback , or cloud - cloud collisions . in a sense",
    "all of this physics is  upstream \" of our theory : processes such as these are almost certainly responsible for determining the distribution of gas surface density within a galaxy .",
    "our model addresses the next step of how , once large - scale processes assemble the gas , some fraction of it forms molecular clouds and then turns into stars .",
    "we have therefore separated the problem of star formation into two parts , and provided a tentative solution for one of them : galactic - scale processes determine @xmath10 , but the physics responsible for determining the star formation rate thereafter is purely local , and can be understood without reference to galactic - scale behavior .",
    "our model shows that a much of the recent observational work on star formation can be understood in terms of a simple model for that local process .",
