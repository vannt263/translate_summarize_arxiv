    "shadowgraphy is a technique to visualise modulations in discrete objects @xcite and is used extensively in our daily life . for example , when sun rays propagate through a transparent object with non - flat surface , one can readily observe the modulation of the light intensity behind the object on a screen placed a suitable distance away .",
    "this occurs because when incoherent light rays propagate , different refractive indices in the object cause the rays paths to be deflected , resulting in the intensity modulation . with its simplicity ,",
    "the shadowgraphy technique has become a widely used diagnostic tool in many different fields in physics and engineering .",
    "examples are diagnosing plasma wakefields @xcite , measuring temperatures in combustion processes @xcite , and characterization of optical systems @xcite . a similar technique , that of proton radiography , is also widely employed to diagnose the structure in laser - plasma experiments @xcite . in proton radiography , instead of using light rays , a proton beam is fired into the plasma .",
    "the electric and magnetic field inside the plasma deflect the protons trajectories .",
    "proton beams are both highly laminar and have discrete divergence angles that allow magnification of the object , provided that the screen is placed far enough away from the object . by looking at the intensity modulation of the proton beam on the screen , one can see the structure inside the plasma with @xmath0 resolution . among the applications of proton radiography are studies of experimental magnetic reconnection phenomena @xcite , observing solitons @xcite , laser channeling in plasmas @xcite , and observing the weibel instability @xcite .",
    "one emphasises here that both the shadowgraphy and proton radiography techniques share the same underlying principle .",
    "thus , one can refer to proton radiography as shadowgraphy and vice - versa , without losing generalities .",
    "we will do this throughout this paper . by doing so ,",
    "we show that this new approach provides a powerful new quantitative diagnostic tool for high - energy - density plasma science .",
    "although shadowgraphy is widely used in plasma science , in many cases it is used as a qualitative analysis tool @xcite .",
    "there have been many efforts in the past to retrieve the quantitative information from shadowgrams , but it has only been possible , so far , in limited cases where the intensity modulations are small .",
    "this is done mainly by employing poisson s equation solver @xcite or by using the diffusion equation @xcite for specific cases @xcite .",
    "the non - linear nature of shadowgraphy makes it a challenging task for large modulation cases .",
    "some experiments also make use of a grid to estimate the deflection of the beam @xcite . however , the technique depends on the grid resolution and it becomes harder to estimate when the feature to be observed is about the same size as the grid resolution or smaller @xcite .    in this paper a method to retrieve the quantitative information from shadowgraph images for large intensity modulations , without using a grid , is presented . an incoherent beam for optical shadowgraphy is also assumed throughout . by retrieving the quantitative information one can interpret phenomena in much greater detail , and thus provide a greater understanding of the diagnosed system .",
    "section [ sec : theory ] provides equations underlying the shadowgraphy and proton radiography techniques .",
    "then we explain the method to retrieve the quantitative information , as well as its implementation , in section [ sec : method ] .",
    "benchmarking with simulations is presented in section [ sec : benchmark ] and tests on real experimental results in section [ sec : experiment ] .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "if beams of light or charged particles are fired into deflecting objects along the @xmath1-axis , they will be deflected by an amount of @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the deflection potential .",
    "the deflection potentials for optical shadowgraphy and proton radiography cases , respectively , are @xcite    [ eq : deflection - potentials ] @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the refractive index of the object in light shadowgraphy cases , @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively are the electric and magnetic potential , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the charge , energy , and mass of the particle in the beam , respectively .",
    "it is assumed that the beam propagates in straight lines during the interaction with the object .    with each deflection ,",
    "beams at position @xmath11 on the object plane are mapped to position @xmath12 on the screen according the equations below , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the distance between the object and the screen .",
    "these equations assume the beams are collimated before the interaction with the objects . for diverging beams using the paraxial approximation",
    ", one can simply replace @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the distance from the beam source to the object .    from the mapping equations ,",
    "one can obtain the intensity of the beam on the screen as @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the beam intensity on the screen without deflections .",
    "the term @xmath20 is the determinant of the jacobian matrix of @xmath21 with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "the jacobian in the denominator is what makes shadowgraphy cases non - linear for relatively large @xmath22 or @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath22 or @xmath14 is large enough , it can make the determinant of the jacobian matrix very small , hence it causes very high intensity at some positions on the screen .",
    "this is called _",
    "in order to retrieve quantitative information in shadowgrams , one needs the beam profiles both with and without the object in position .",
    "we refer to the beam profile without the object as the source profile , @xmath23 and the profile with the object as the target profile , @xmath24 .",
    "it is assumed that the object does not emit or absorb the beam , so the total flux in the source profile is the same as the total flux in the target profile . with this assumption ,",
    "the problem can be restated as the monge transport problem @xcite : how are the particles transported from the source profile to the target profile such that the total distance for all particles is minimised ?",
    "the source profile is first divided into several sites using the weighted lloyd s sampling algorithm @xcite .",
    "the @xmath25-th site at @xmath26 occupies a region or cell on the source plane , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 for all @xmath29 .",
    "this is called voronoi diagram @xcite . in this case",
    ", each voronoi cell has approximately the same flux .",
    "starting from the same position of sites on the source plane , then assign weights , @xmath30 , to each site to form a power diagram , or weighted voronoi diagram , on the target plane . in the power diagram ,",
    "the @xmath25-th site at @xmath31 occupies a region or cell on plane @xmath32 where @xmath33 for all @xmath29 .",
    "setting all weights to zero produces the voronoi diagram .",
    "denote @xmath34 as the @xmath25-th cell on the source plane , @xmath35 as the cell @xmath25 on the target plane as a function of all cell weights , @xmath30 .",
    "note that @xmath36 . also denote @xmath37 and",
    "@xmath38 as the flux of the @xmath25-th cell on the source and target planes , respectively .",
    "the objective of the algorithm is to find the weights , such that transporting the flux from the source plane with intensity profile @xmath23 to the target plane produces the same intensity profile as the target profile , @xmath24 , and the total distance travelled by all cells from the source plane to the target plane is minimised .",
    "aurenhammer @xcite found that the weights can be found in the minimum of a convex function , @xmath39.\\ ] ] it is noted that @xmath40 .",
    "the gradient of the function is given by @xmath41 these equations have been employed to design surfaces of transparent objects that produce caustic designs @xcite .    once the minimum of equation [ eq : convex - function ] is reached , the centroid position of each power cell in the power diagram , @xmath42 , is computed . from the @xmath25-th power cell s centroid position on the target plane , @xmath43 , and the site s position on the source plane , @xmath44 , the displacement in the @xmath45 and @xmath46 directions",
    "can be obtained by @xmath47 .",
    "however , the displacement from source plane to target plane is obtained only at positions where the sites on the source plane are located . to fill in the displacement as a function of every position on the source plane , @xmath48 ,",
    "sites closest to the 4 corners are first moved to the corners and then the natural neighbour interpolation is used .",
    "the sites need to be moved to the corners so that the convex hull of the sites covers all the source plane and thus natural neighbour interpolation can be used .",
    "this causes some distortion near the corners , but this can be minimised by having more sites .",
    "the result of this method is curl - free at most positions , thus the deflection potential , @xmath3 , can then be obtained by integrating the deflection in the @xmath45 or @xmath46 direction .",
    "we call this method the power diagram method in the remaining sections of this paper .",
    "there are a lot of basic computational geometry algorithms employed in the implementation of this method .",
    "first , to obtain the power diagram of sites , algorithms that use convex hull and transformation to dual space are employed @xcite .",
    "voronoi diagram can be obtained by the same algorithm by setting all weights to zero . bounded voronoi and power diagrams inside a rectangle",
    "are obtained by clipping the diagram with the rectangle using the sutherland - hodgman algorithm @xcite .",
    "the sutherland - hodgman algorithm is employed for all polygon clipping cases in the implementation , since all polygons are convex in this case .    to calculate the function in equation [ eq : convex - function ]",
    ", one needs to compute the weighted area ( i.e. @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) , weighted centroid position ( i.e. @xmath44 and @xmath49 ) , and the weighted moment of inertia ( i.e. @xmath50 ) of each cell in the power diagram . in order to simplify the problem ,",
    "it is reasonable to pixelate the intensity profile and assume the intensity within one pixel is constant .",
    "thus , the above parameters can be computed by splitting the cell into several polygons with uniform density within a pixel , computing the parameters for each polygon , and merging the parameters to give the parameters for the given cell @xcite .",
    "the area , centroid position , and moment of inertia with respect to the origin of a 2d convex polygon with @xmath51 vertices can be shown to be    @xmath52(x_{i+1 } y_i - x_i y_{i+1 } ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath53 is the vertex position of each polygon and they are ordered in the clockwise direction .",
    "note that @xmath54 .",
    "the cells centroids for lloyd s algorithm are also computed by this method .    to obtain faster convergence to the global minimum of the function in equation [ eq : convex - function ]",
    ", one can use a quasi - newton gradient descent algorithm @xcite .",
    "however , using a quasi - newton algorithm requires @xmath55 memory , where @xmath56 is the number of sites , and it can be very large computationally .",
    "thus , using the limited memory bfgs ( l - bfgs ) method @xcite can save memory while still achieving fast convergence .",
    "one can also use a multi - stage approach to minimise equation [ eq : convex - function ] faster @xcite .",
    "the code can be found at https://github.com/mfkasim91/invert-shadowgraphy .",
    "the first test for this method considers the case of a proton beam with energy of @xmath57 propagating in the positive @xmath58-direction and going through a toroidal magnetic field .",
    "the toroidal magnetic field around the centre gives a line - integrated magnetic field on the object plane of @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the maximum value of line - integrated value of the toroidal magnetic field .",
    "this basic structure has been found in laser - plasma experiments , such as in magnetic reconnection experiments @xcite .",
    "even though only magnetic field cases are considered here , it can be expanded into light shadowgraphy and electric field cases using equations [ eq : deflection - potentials ] .",
    "the transverse size of the toroidal magnetic field is assumed to be @xmath61 .",
    "the beam is deflected by the magnetic field and captured on the screen @xmath62 away .",
    "the distance from the source to the magnetic field is @xmath63 , thus giving magnification of 15 .",
    "it is assumed that the magnetic field size in the @xmath58-direction is very small compared to @xmath17 and @xmath14 .",

    "the intensity modulation on the screen is shown in figure ( d ) with its 1d - cross - section on figure ( e ) .",
    "the intensity on the screen is augmented by gaussian noise with variance 10% of the average intensity value to test robustness of the method . ]",
    "the beam s deflected speed is @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the charge - to - mass ratio of the proton beam .",
    "thus , the deflected angle is @xmath68 .",

    "the picture in ( a ) is taken for the case with @xmath76 , where caustics are just formed . the quantitative comparison for the maximum value of the line - integrated magnetic field",
    "is given in figure ( b ) .",
    "the top picture ( b , top ) shows the maximum retrieved value of @xmath77 using the power diagram method ( solid blue ) and the poisson s equation solver method ( solid red ) compared with the original values . the relative error between",
    "the retrieved and original values is given in figure ( b , bottom ) .",
    "the dashed vertical lines in figures ( b ) show the value when caustics are present .",
    "the dashed horizontal line shows the relative error of 10% . ]",
    "it can be seen that the retrieved line integrated magnetic field gives very good agreement with the original profile , even when caustics are formed .",
    "the error on the retrieved value increases just when the branches of the caustics are relatively distinguishable .",
    "this is because in regions between the caustics branches , the beams are coming from more than one different position on the object plane , while this method assumes that each region on the target plane is formed from one region on the object plane .",
    "however , one can still infer magnitude of the deflection potential in this case within some error .",
    "a slightly higher relative error at small values of @xmath77 is caused by the noise .",
    "the intensity modulation at that point is comparable to the noise .",
    "as the intensity modulation gets larger , the effect of noise seems to be weaker .",
    "it is observed that this method amplifies low - frequency components of the image and reduces the high - frequency components .",
    "it makes the power diagram method somewhat less robust to low frequency noise , but robust to high frequency noise .",
    "this can be solved by applying a high frequency filter to the image before it is processed using the power diagram method .    on the other hand ,",
    "the retrieved value using the poisson s equation solver deviates significantly from the original value .",
    "the poisson s equation solver gives relative error of 10% when @xmath78 while the power diagram method gives the same relative error when @xmath79 .",
    "if one wants an accuracy of less than 10% , the power diagram method gives 10 times larger working range than the poisson s equation solver s working range .",
    "as an additional benchmark to the case described above , we also tried retrieving quantitative information for arbitrary magnetic field structures .",
    "fig [ fig : benchmark - many - structures ] shows the retrieval results of the magnetic field with various structures with the same setup as the previous case .",
    "each image has a size of @xmath80 pixels with depth of 16 bits .",
    "the code was run on a highly parallel computer cluster using 32 cores .",
    "it takes around 2 - 3 hours to process one image .    in fig",
    "[ fig : benchmark - many - structures ] , one can see that the retrieved magnetic field structures agree very well with the original magnetic field .",
    "it is also apparent that the retrieved magnetic field can be different from what it seems in the proton radiography image .",
    "moreover , the size of the structure can also be different , as shown in fig [ fig : benchmark - many - structures](e ) where the structure s size is actually smaller than it seems in the proton radiography image .",
    "an analysis method will only be useful if it can be shown to work on real experimental data and give reasonable results . in this section ,",
    "the power diagram method is used to analyse experimental data from svert , _ et al . _ in cases of plasma wakefield shadowgraphy @xcite . in the experiment ,",
    "a laser pulse was fired into a plasma to generate electron density modulation wave associated with a laser - driven wakefield . another laser pulse with much lower intensity",
    "was fired perpendicularly to the wakefield as a probe for the shadowgraphy method .",
    "the electron density fluctations of the wakefield caused modulations of the refractive indices in the plasma .",
    "the refractive index modulation in the plasma caused the probe s path to bend so that some parts of the probe were brighter than others at the detector .",
    "the refractive index of a plasma with density profile @xmath81 is @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the vacuum permittivity constant , @xmath84 and @xmath10 are the electron s charge and mass , respectively , and @xmath85 is the frequency of the light . using equations [ eq : deflection - potentials ] and [ eq : plasma - refractive - index ] with approximation @xmath86 , the deflection potential for light in a plasma is @xmath87 thus , the information that can be retrieved from shadowgrams using the power diagram method is @xmath88 .",
    "one of the main challenges in inverting the shadowgrams for real experimental data is the non - uniformity of the probe s unmodulated intensity , i.e. the intensity profile without deflection from objects .",
    "this can be a big problem because the inversion processes from shadowgrams to deflection potentials amplify low frequency components . even though this can be solved by taking the intensity profile without the object ,",
    "the data is not usually available or reliable because of shot - to - shot variations .",
    "therefore , a straightforward solution is to apply a high - pass filter to either the shadowgrams and/or the resulting deflection potentials .",
    "the pulse that drives the wakefield has a wavelength of 810 nm , duration of 35 fs , and peak intensity @xmath89 .",
    "the probe pulse has the same wavelength , but with shorter duration , 5.9 fs .",
    "the shadowgrams for a plasma with density @xmath90 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plasma - shadowgraphy - experiment](a ) . using the power diagram method and equation [ eq : deflection - potential - plasma ] , it is possible to infer the line - integrated relative electron density modulation , @xmath91 from the shadowgrams .",
    "the inverted results from the shadowgrams are shown in fig .",

    "the figures still show the wakefield features with additional information of @xmath91 .",
    "it is shown from fig .",
    "[ fig : plasma - shadowgraphy - experiment ] that the power diagram method in this paper is robust enough to analyse real experimental results with additional preprocessing and post - processing .",
    "we have presented a new method to retrieve quantitative data from shadowgraphic images . in the cases considered in this paper ,",
    "a beam propagates through an object , gets deflected by it , and then captured on a screen .",
    "the intensity modulation on the screen acts as the input and the deflection potential of the object is regarded as the output of this method .",
    "it assumes the beam propagates in straight lines while interacting with the object . besides shadowgraphy ,",
    "the method in this paper can also be applied to proton radiography cases .",
    "the method has been benchmarked for a toroidal magnetic field case , which has been found in some laser plasma experiments , and a plasma wakefield shadowgraphy case . in some test cases ,",
    "the method successfully retrieved the deflection potential profiles with relative error less than 10% for large intensity modulation , even for cases where caustics are present .",
    "it is also tested using arbitrary structures of the diagnosed objects and gives very good results in retrieving structures with their quantitative parameters .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the method is also robust to noise , especially high - frequency noise .",
    "this extends the working range of the poisson s solver equation by an order of magnitude .",
    "it is also shown that the method can be applied to real experimental results , with some additional pre - processing and post - processing . by applying this method",
