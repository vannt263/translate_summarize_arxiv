    "a spinor bose - einstein condensate is a system that possesses both superfluid and magnetic order @xcite .",
    "experiments are able to explore transitions between phases of different magnetic order by controlling the quadratic zeeman energy ( @xmath0 ) that shifts the magnetic sublevels @xcite .",
    "such a system presents a rich playground for studies of non - equilibrium phenomena , including defect formation related to the rate that the phase transition is crossed @xcite , through to the late - time coarsening dynamics describing how the small domains produced by the quench anneal towards the equilibrium state @xcite .",
    "studies have largely focused on the spin properties of the system , leaving the superfluid dynamics unexplored .",
    "we note that in binary condensates , which can be regarded as a pseudo spin-@xmath1 system , there has been work on both spin coarsening @xcite and aspects of the superfluid behavior ( e.g.  analyzed via kinetic energy spectra @xcite ) .",
    "the development of various techniques for measuring spin @xcite and superfluid correlations ( e.g.  see @xcite ) demonstrate that it is possible to study the evolution of both types of order in spinor experiments .",
    "the relationship between spin and superfluid order has been considered in the equilibrium properties of spinor condensates .",
    "for example , in ref .  @xcite it was found that for a large spin - dependent interaction , ferromagnetism emerges at a higher temperature than condensation .    here",
    "we study the superfluid and spin ordering dynamics of a ferromagnetic spin-1 condensate quenched into a easy - axis ferromagnetic phase , where the spin order preferentially aligns ( or anti - aligns ) along the quantization axis defining the quadratic zeeman energy shift .",
    "initially small domains form , but grow as time passes . at sufficiently late times",
    "this coarsening dynamics can enter a universal scaling regime @xcite : the correlation function of the order parameter collapses to a universal ( time - independent ) form when space is scaled by a characteristic length @xmath2 , which yields the dynamic critical exponent @xmath3 . here",
    "we find that the spin and superfluid order exhibit universal scaling , but do not develop identically .",
    "the spin order spreads more rapidly across the system than the superfluid order , with different dynamic critical exponents for each type of ordering .    in this paper",
    "we consider two types of quenches . the first ( standard ) quench ( e.g.  see @xcite ) is to start with an equilibrium non - magnetic ( polar ) condensate at large @xmath0 and then to suddenly quench to a negative @xmath0 value where the easy - axis magnetic phase is the ground state .",
    "we also propose a second type of quench that utilizes the atomic physics toolbox of coherent manipulations : this differs from the first quench in that a @xmath4 spin rotation is applied to the initial state immediately prior to @xmath0 being quenched .",
    "both quenches produce the same late time coarsening behavior , but we show that the second quench has less heating and the early - time dynamics ( where local order develops ) concludes more rapidly , suggesting this may be more suitable for experiments where long times are difficult to access .",
    "we finally consider the areas of the individual spin domains that form after the quench and how these evolve in time .",
    "our results show that once the domains develop in the system their areas vary over many orders of magnitude . at sufficiently long times",
    "the domain area distribution decays as a power law @xmath5 for sufficiently large @xmath6 , where @xmath6 is the domain area .",
    "this can be related to ideas of percolation theory @xcite , as has also been pointed in in recent work on the immiscibility phase transition in a binary condensate @xcite .",

    "we demonstrate that in the late time dynamics these correlation functions exhibit dynamical scaling , albeit with different growth laws .",

    "in contrast , such percolating domains for the q1 quench only develop on long time scales [ i.e.  @xmath140 in fig .  [ figdomainareas](a ) ] .",
    "this difference likely originates from the nature of the @xmath141 magnon branch for the q2 quench which has unstable wavelengths extending from @xmath97 up to the system size [ e.g.  see fig .",
    "[ figspectrum](c ) ] . in comparison",
    "the unstable modes for the q1 quench are restricted to a finite wavelength range around @xmath142 [ e.g.  see fig .  [",
    "figspectrum](a ) ] .    we can apply dynamic scaling to the domain size distribution . since the @xmath101 correlation function grows as @xmath105 , that the domain areas should grow as @xmath143 , and if dynamic scaling holds we would expect @xmath144 to be a universal time - independent distribution .",
    "we perform this scaling in figs .",
    "[ figdomainareas](b ) and ( d ) . at late - times",
    "( insets to those figures ) we see reasonable collapse of the area distribution , however at earlier - times ( @xmath145 ) only the q2 quench exhibits scaling collapse over a wide range of areas .",
    "we also indicate on the scaled results the @xmath146 power law , which provides a reasonable fit to the distribution for sufficiently large domains . such power law behavior in domain size ( or  cluster size \" ) distribution",
    "is predicted in percolation theory near the percolation transition with @xmath147 in 2d .",
    "normally in percolation theory the occupation probability ( @xmath148 ) is varied to pass through the transition .",
    "for the spin-1 system this is controlled by the total ( conserved ) @xmath3-magnetization , and for our results ( where the total @xmath3-magnetization is zero ) the probability of a location being in a positive ( or negative ) domain is @xmath149 , which is approximately the percolation threshold condition in 2d . in order to explore the percolation transition it would be necessary to vary the total @xmath3-magnetization , which would in turn vary the relative portion of two domain types .",
    "such a study has been performed using simulations of a segregating binary condensate , where the effective magnetization is controlled by varying the relative portion of the two atomic species @xcite .",
    "this study presented strong evidence for a percolation threshold at @xmath150 .",
    "we have considered the spin and superfluid ordering of a spin-1 condensate . we have found that in the coarsening dynamics these two types of order exhibit dynamic scaling , but develop with different dynamic critical exponents .",
    "we find that ( and as previously observed in refs .",
    "@xcite ) the spin - order develops with a growth law of @xmath151 , consistent with a binary fluid in the inertial hydrodynamic regime @xcite .",
    "our new results here concern the superfluid ordering , which we find to grow much more slowly as @xmath152 . indeed , our simulations out to @xmath84 reveal that @xmath114 is almost an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath93 [ see figs .  [ figcorrq1](e ) and [ figcorrq2](e ) ] .",
    "future work will involve developing an understanding for the slower superfluid growth rate , and whether aspects of the spin domains ( e.g.  shedding of various types of vortices at the spin domain walls , or other types of topological defects ) play a role .",
    "another direction for investigation is to consider our observed dynamics in the context of pre - thermalization and turbulence theory , which have proven fruitful directions of research for the immiscibility transition in a binary condensate @xcite ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the standard q1 quench , in which the quadratic zeeman energy is suddenly changed , we propose and simulate a second type of quench ( q2 ) in which a spin rotation is applied prior to the zeeman energy being changed . in the late - time dynamics both quenches",
    "exhibit the same ordering dynamics , demonstrating the universal nature of the coarsening dynamics",
    ". however , the q2 quench has favourable properties for exploring domain formation : ( i ) the domains form more rapidly and with less heating ; ( ii ) the domains percolate at early times .",
    "these properties may make the q2 quench better suited to experiments ( e.g. ,  with @xmath20rb condensates ) , where the small spin - dependent interaction makes it challenging to explore long - time post - quench dynamics .",
    "for example , some of the short - time predictions we have made for domain formation and the behavior of the spin domain area distribution should be feasible to study in current experiments .",
