    "this is the markov chain @xmath191 that is generated by the operator @xmath6 .",
    "its behavior is as follows : when the walker is at a site @xmath192 it waits for an exponential time with expectation @xmath193 ( see ) and then jumps to one of the neighboring sites .",
    "this is why we call @xmath194 the local speed of the random walk at the site @xmath195 . to which neighbor the random walker jumps is random with probabilities proportional to the corresponding conductances : if @xmath196 is a specific neighbor of @xmath195 , the random walker jumps to @xmath196 with probability @xmath197 .",
    "we call @xmath198 the probability w.r.t .  to the random walk where the superscript @xmath199 refers to a fixed environment ( quenched probability ) and",
    "the subscript @xmath195 refers to the starting point of the random walker : @xmath200 = 1 $ ] .",
    "the corresponding expectation is called @xmath201 .",
    "let @xmath202 be the escape time from a set @xmath203 , i.e. , @xmath204 .",
    "there exists a natural relation between the principal dirichlet eigenvalue of the operator @xmath205 and the expected escape time @xmath206 $ ] from the box @xmath48 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8.4.1 ) : @xmath207 { \\aftergroup\\egroup\\originalright})^{-1}\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , an upper bound for the principal dirichlet eigenvalue @xmath37 implies a lower bound on the maximal expected escape time from the box @xmath48 .",
    "now lemma 2.1(i ) of @xcite implies that if the heat kernel @xmath208\\qquad ( x , y\\in{\\mathbb{z}}^d\\,,\\ ; t\\geq 0)\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] has a diffusive on - diagonal upper bound , i.e. there exists @xmath209 and a random @xmath210 such that @xmath211 then @xmath212\\sim n^{-2}$ ] .",
    "diffusive heat - kernel upper bounds are a necessary condition for the validity of a local clt .",
    "but if we assume that the principal dirichlet eigenvalue scales subdiffusively , i.e. , @xmath172 , then eventually @xmath212\\gg n^{-2}$ ] and therefore a subdiffusively scaling principal dirichlet eigenvalue contradicts the validity of a local clt .",
    "we can explain the exploding escape times by showing that a large box contains some sites where the expected time to even leave the initial position is anomalously long .",
    "although this effect is related to the one responsible for the anomalous heat - kernel decay observed in @xcite , it is still a different one . in @xcite ,",
    "the dominating effect is that a random walk finds a trap elsewhere and then returns to its initial position .",
    "this behavior , however , has a more complex dependence on the laplacian s eigenvalues .      for the lower bound of the principal dirichlet eigenvalue we have to put in significantly more work than for the upper bound .",
    "the key idea , however , is linked to the considerations for the shape theorem of first - passage percolation , see e.g.  cox and durrett @xcite for the sample case @xmath213 .",
    "the philosophy is that we have to show that each site in the box @xmath48 is sufficiently well reachable by conductances that are significantly greater than the lower bound candidate @xmath60 .",
    "note that this is similar to the idea of lemma 4.6 in @xcite where the authors proved this for a polynomial tail of the conductances with parameter @xmath16 and the candidate @xmath214 with @xmath215 .",
    "it turns out that a crucial element of the proof is to give a condition that implies that @xmath27-a.s .  for @xmath58 large enough all sites in the box @xmath48",
    "have at least one link with conductance greater than @xmath52 , similar to @xcite and @xcite .",

    "on the other hand , if condition is violated , then the same arguments as in cox and durrett @xcite yield that @xmath27-a.s .",
    "as @xmath58 tends to infinity , the box @xmath48 contains a @xmath52-trap infinitely often .",
