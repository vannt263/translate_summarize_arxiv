    "the `` tanpopo '' ( yamagishi _ et al_. , 2007 , 2009 ) is a mission to conduct several astrobiological studies on the japanese experiment module ( jem ) of the international space station ( iss ) .",
    "one of primary goals of the tanpopo mission is to capture dust particles such as micrometeoroids , particles of terrestrial origin and space debris on the low earth orbit ( leo ) and to analyze them on ground after safe retrieval . in order to achieve this goal",
    ", we are developing a dust particle collector based on silica aerogel . the aerogel tiles with captured dust particles",
    "will be brought back to the ground for chemical and biological analyses .",
    "terrestrial life may be ejected into outer space by volcanic eruptions , meteorite impacts and other processes ( kring , 2000 ; simkin and siebert , 1994 ; griffin , 2004 ) .",
    "in fact , microbes have been collected at altitudes from 3 km to 77 km using balloons , aircrafts and rockets since 1936 ( yang _ et al_. , 2009 as a review ) .",
    "if terrestrial microbes are found in dust particles captured by the tanpopo mission on the iss at the leo ( @xmath2400 km altitude ) , such a result will support the possibility that microbes may escape from the earth to outer space .",
    "the dust particles collected by the tanpopo aerogel collector will be manually retracted from the recovered aerogel tiles for the analysis of microbial dna by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) .",
    "pcr is one of the most sensitive methods for detection of dna .",
    "the method can theoretically detect single dna molecule ( mullis and faloona , 1987 ) .",
    "the pcr amplification of microbial 16s ribosomal rna ( rrna ) gene has been widely used for molecular phylogenetic studies ( weisburg _ et al_. , 1991 ) . according to hypervelocity impact experiments in ground laboratories , fragmented or molten aerogels adhered around the surface of impacted dust particles during the deceleration process .",
    "therefore , we have to evaluate the effect of adherent aerogels upon the pcr analysis of the dust particle .",
    "silica aerogel is an optically transparent solid with very low bulk density and has been used for capturing microparticles ( @xmath0 m ) with hypervelocity ( km / s ) ( burchell _ et al_. , 2006 as a review ) . lower damage of dust particles upon the impact",
    "is expected from the extremely low density of aerogels .",
    "aerogel - based dust collectors were already used in past space missions such as esa eureca ( yano and mcdonnellm , 1994 ) , the mpac experiments by jaxa ( nasda ) ( kitazawa _ et al_. , 2000 ) and the stardust mission by nasa ( brownlee _ et al_. , 2006 ) .",
    "while aerogel blocks with a density of 0.03 g/@xmath1 were used in the mpac experiment , density gradient ( 0.010.05 g/@xmath1 ) aerogels were used in the stardust mission . as for the tanpopo mission",
    ", we plan to utilize aerogel tiles with a double - layered structure .",
    "the double - layered aerogel tile is composed of a main surface layer ( 0.01 g/@xmath1 ) to capture dust particles and a base layer ( 0.03 g/@xmath1 ) to support the main surface layer and also to stop dust particles with higher energy .",
    "the development of aerogels with ultra - low densities is the key to the tanpopo mission to obtain micrometeoroids with low damage . for the pcr analysis of captured microbial dna , aerogel tiles",
    "must not be contaminated with bacterial dna in the course of manufacturing .",
    "aerogels must not interfere with the pcr reaction , either . in this paper",
    ", we describe our production method of silica aerogel , and report the results of the hypervelocity impact experiment and the analysis of microbial dna contaminations in aerogels by pcr .",
    "we also discuss the results in terms of the feasibility for the tanpopo mission .",
    "the schematic diagram of our production procedure of hydrophobic silica aerogel is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , and the detailed procedure of our production method is described below .",
    "the production technique is basically same as adachi _",
    "et al_. ( 1995 ) .",
    "we expanded the technique to the density range lower than 0.03 g/@xmath1 ( tabata _ et al_. , 2005 , 2010 ) .",
    "the following production procedure is applied to the production of aerogel of the density range between 0.01 and 0.03 g/@xmath1 .",
    "aerogels should be cleanly manufactured .",
    "most processes of aerogel production were performed in a clean booth ( class 1000 ) .",
    "tools for the aerogel production were soaked in 5% extran ma01 ( merck ) for 24 h. they were rinsed with tap water followed by substituting the water layer with ultrapure water .",
    "starting materials are as follows : methyl silicate 51 ( fuso chemical co. , ltd . ) , ethanol ( 99.5 ) ( special grade chemicals 055 - 00457 , wako pure chemical industries , ltd . ) , 28% ammonia solution ( special grade chemicals 016 - 03146 , wako pure chemical industries , ltd . ) , silazane ( z-6079 , dow corning toray co. , ltd . ) and ethanol ( 99 ) ( synthetic , non - denatolized , japan alcohol trading co. , ltd ) .",
    "_ alcogel synthesis _ : tetramethoxysilane [ @xmath3 can be easily hydrolyzed , condensed and polymerized in ethanol to produce alcoholic silica gel ( alcogel ) with the help of a catalyst : @xmath4 @xmath5 these two successive reactions are the fundamental processes of the alcogel synthesis .",
    "our unique production technique utilizes `` methyl silicate 51 ( ms51 ) , '' which is commercially available , to simplify the alcogel synthesis process . ms51",
    "is prepared by oligomerizing tetramethoxysilane into oligomers ( average degree of polymerization is 4 ) , which has a high content of silica ( 51% by weight ) . at first , two solutions , solution 1 and 2 ,",
    "were prepared for the alcogel production .",
    "solution 1 was made by adding ms51 to ethanol ( 99.5 ) .",
    "solution 2 was made by adding ammonia aqueous solution as a base catalyst to ethanol .",
    "the solutions 1 and 2 were mixed in a polyethylene beaker at room temperature and were stirred for 30 sec .",
    "the mixed solution was poured into a polystyrene mold and covered with a lid .",
    "it took several minutes to complete the gel - formation reaction .",
    "we fabricated double - layered alcogels by repeating these operations .",
    "after the gelation of the first layer , the mixed solution prepared for the second layer was poured on the first layer .",
    "the first and second layers did not mix but were integrally - molded , and were treated as a monolithic tile in the following process .",
    "preparation recipes for aerogels with densities of 0.01 g/@xmath1 and 0.03 g/@xmath1 were as follows : ms51:ethanol ( 99.5):ammonia aqueous solution = 1.43:93.41:5.16 in weight and 4.88:90.16:4.96 , respectively .    _ aging _ : the synthesized alcogel kept in the polystyrene mold with the lid was placed in an air - tight vessel and aged at room temperature for 6 days to facilitate the formation of a three dimensional network of sio@xmath6 . in this aging period ,",
    "the alcogel shrinks and comes off from the mold .",
    "the alcogel became stiff enough to keep its form by itself .    _",
    "rinse-1 _ : after 6 days , the lid was removed and the air - tight vessel was filled with ethanol ( 99 ) , so that the alcogel was immersed in ethanol .",
    "then , the vessel was sealed again and put in a water bath and incubated at 35@xmath7c for 9 days .",
    "it is essential to keep the alcogel in ethanol to prevent it from drying .",
    "it is important that the alcogel was additionally aged at a constant and good temperature to obtain aerogels with desired densities with high reproducibility .    _",
    "hydrophobic treatment _ : hydroxyl groups on the surface of sio@xmath6 particles are likely to be charged and they can easily react with other ions . they were thus replaced with trimethylsiloxy groups [ @xmath8osi(ch@xmath9)@xmath9 ] by adding hydrophobic reagent , hexamethyldisilazane [ ( ( ch@xmath9)@xmath9si)@xmath6nh ] : @xmath11 for the hydrophobic treatment , the alcogel was detached from the mold , transferred into a stainless steel tray with many small holes and immersed into the ethanol used in the rinse-1 process .",
    "the hydrophobic reagent was poured into the ethanol .",
    "the ratio of the hydrophobic reagent to ethanol was 1:9 in volume .",
    "the alcogel was kept in the solution at room temperature for 3 days .    _",
    "rinse-2 _ : ammonia generated in the hydrophobic reaction was extracted by ethanol .",
    "the alcogel on the tray was transferred into fresh ethanol .",
    "the ethanol was replaced by new ethanol every 2 days , 3 times .    _ supercritical drying _ : because the fine structure of silica networks is easily destroyed if the alcogel is dried in air , the alcogel was dried by the supercritical drying method .",
    "the critical pressure and temperature of ethanol are 6.4 mpa and 243.1@xmath7c , respectively . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , pressure and temperature in an ethanol supercritical extraction equipment ( semi - automated autoclave ) were well controlled around the critical point on the pressure  temperature phase diagram of ethanol . the internal pressure of the sealed and heated autoclave was increased and exceeded the critical pressure ( 6.4 mpa ) by increasing temperature .",
    "the pressure was controlled and maintained at 7.3 mpa by opening a pressure control valve . when internal temperature of the further heated autoclave exceeded the critical temperature ( 243.1@xmath7c ) and reached 260@xmath7c , pressure reduction was started with the pressure control valve .",
    "after the temperature was kept at 260@xmath7c for 2 h , the heater was turned off .",
    "we spent approximately 24 h before the internal pressure returned to the atmospheric pressure , and it took additional 2 days to cool the autoclave to room temperature with injection of nitrogen gas .",
    "we spent approximately 1 month to complete all steps for the aerogel production .          in order to test the performance of the double - layered aerogel tile as a cosmic dust collector",
    ", we have performed a simulated hypervelocity impact experiment using the two - stage light - gas gun at isas , jaxa in june 2010 .",
    "the gun can fire microparticles at a velocity of up to 7 km / s by using a cylindrical case called the `` sabot . ''",
    "the drive gas of the launching tube is hydrogen . as a projectile , soda lime glass microspheres ( thermo fisher scientific inc . ) with 30.1 @xmath0 m in diameter and",

    "_ preparation of samples _ : the surfaces of an aerogel block were carefully removed aseptically to avoid the possible surface contamination after the production of aerogels . the blocks with various sizes ( 0.060.24 mg ) were prepared from the aerogel with a density of 0.009 g/@xmath1 . the dna sample was prepared according to the method described by sambrook and russell ( 2001 ) .",
    "cells of bacterial species _ deinococcus radiodurans _",

    "<S> hydrophobic silica aerogels with ultra - low densities have been designed and developed as cosmic dust capture media for the tanpopo mission which is proposed to be carried out on the international space station . </S>",
    "<S> glass particles as a simulated cosmic dust with 30 @xmath0 m in diameter and 2.4 g/@xmath1 in density were successfully captured by the novel aerogel at a velocity of 6 km / s . </S>",
    "<S> background levels of contaminated dna in the ultra - low density aerogel were lower than the detection limit of a polymerase chain reaction assay . </S>",
    "<S> these results show that the manufactured aerogel has good performance as a cosmic dust collector and sufficient quality in respect of dna contamination . </S>",
    "<S> the aerogel is feasible for the biological analyses of captured cosmic dust particles in the astrobiological studies .    </S>",
