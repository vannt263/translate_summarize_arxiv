    "organisms exist in ever - changing environments and need to surmount the challenges posed by external variability .",
    "when environmental conditions vary unpredictably , the appropriate measure of evolutionary success is not the average fitness across generations but its geometric mean @xcite .",
    "this is because population growth is an inherently multiplicative process that is very sensitive to occasional extreme values @xcite .",
    "thus , if organisms can not accurately predict or detect the most likely environment their offspring will experience , they should hedge their bets by producing a range of progeny phenotypes @xcite .",
    "for instance , it has been argued that seed dormancy provides an instance of parentally induced bet - hedging .",
    "although it might entail germination outside of the optimal time window , variable seed dormancy also increases the probability for some individuals of the progeny to grow under future favorable conditions @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "probabilistic germination strategies constituting a sort of temporal bet - hedging are common in plants from semiarid regions with unpredictable rainfall patterns @xcite .",
    "similarly , spatial seed dispersal might enable plants to distribute their progeny in different environments , minimizing the probability that all of the seeds will disperse to unfavorable sites .",
    "dispersal appears to be particularly beneficial whenever conditions fluctuate in time @xcite .",
    "however , it entails a high risk , as dispersers might end up in unfavorable patches .",
    "consequently , it has been posited that mixed dispersal strategies might emerge to accommodate the risks of dispersal while still ensuring some of its benefits .",
    "several authors have supported this view and argued that the production of progeny with contrasting dispersal abilities by a single maternal genotype constitutes an instance of bet - hedging in heterogeneous environments @xcite    in addition to enabling sampling of new environments , dispersal maximizes the probability of individuals encountering mating partners of diverse genetic backgrounds . locally dispersing individuals",
    "are more likely to mate with relatives and therefore to produce inbred progeny @xcite .",
    "therefore , dispersal away from the maternal site is expected to minimize inbreeding depression and kin competition as well as to buffer variation in environmental quality for the progeny @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been argued that the prevention of inbreeding and kin competition might be especially relevant for the evolution of dispersal strategies @xcite .",
    "conversely , high costs of dispersal , spatial unpredictability in environmental conditions , and local adaptation are expected to select for limited dispersal .",
    "since kin competition and inbreeding avoidance are not independent @xcite , the interaction of these various forces can be summarized as a dynamical balance between the avoidance of inbreeding and the costs and risks associated with dispersal and environmental variability . however , to the best of our knowledge , no study has previously modeled simultaneously the effect of environment variability and inbreeding depression on the evolution of dispersal .",
    "a paradigmatic example of mixed dispersal syndromes is that of heterocarpic plants that produce different types of seeds that vary in their intrinsic dispersal propensity @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "the different dispersal phenotypes tend to be produced by flowers that differ in their mating .",
    "for example , in many taxa , dispersing seeds are produced by open - pollinated flowers while non - dispersing seeds are produced by selfing flowers .",
    "this pattern can be observed in amphicarpic plants that produce aerial chasmogamous ( i.e. , open - pollinated ) and subterranean cleistogamous ( i.e. , strictly self - pollinated ) flowers such as _ amphicarpaea bracteata , amphicarpum purshii , cardamine chenopodifolia , lathyrus amphicarpos , vicia amphicarpa , etc . _ as well as in other plants that produce both chasmogamous and cleistogamous flowers , such as _ agrostis hiemalis , danthonia spicata , impatiens capensis _ and _ triplasis purpurea _ @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : plants ] ) .",
    "although amphicarpy might seem a natural history oddity , this association between open - pollinated flowers and dispersing seeds and selfing flowers and non - dispersing seeds is an extreme example of the positive evolutionary correlation between high dispersal propensity and outcrossing and/or between selfing and limited dispersal , predicted by several authors @xcite .        assuming evolution is likely to favor this correlation between dispersal and the mating system , in the present paper we aim to understand the evolution of dispersal strategies taking into account _",
    "i ) _ the effect of temporal variability in environmental conditions and _ ii ) _ the effect of inbreeding depression .",
    "our model differs from previous studies of the correlation between dispersal and the mating system most notably from that of @xcite in that it explicitly incorporates both environmental and genetic costs .",
    "because both the risk of establishment and inbreeding are expected to shape dispersal strategies , we deem it necessary to develop a theoretical framework for the evolution of dispersal that accommodates the two processes .    here , we develop mathematical and computational individual - based models in which organisms live in a ( discretized ) two - dimensional space where each individual is subjected to the demographic processes of reproduction and death , with rates that depend upon temporarily variable environmental conditions .",
    "our models are inspired by heterocarpic annual plants , i.e. by organisms with non - overlapping generations with juvenile dispersal ( _ sensu _",
    "@xcite ) that can produce two different types of propagules differing discretely in their dispersal propensity . as a first approach , we consider a simpler , reductionist case that can be assimilated to amphicarpy : plants produce two types of seeds that differ both in their propensity for dispersal ( dispersing versus non - dispersing ) and in their level of inbreeding ( outcrossing versus selfing ) . in this case , we posit a perfect correlation between dispersal and the mating system that results in non - dispersing seeds having a higher level of inbreeding than dispersing ones .",
    "then , we study a more general case in which the correlation between dispersal and mating is not perfect . plants still produce two types of propagules , but inbreeding depression is derived as a function of the proximity to relatives . in this case , we assume that mating occurs only between individuals that are geographically close and inbreeding depression ensues from the mating between individuals that are genetically related .    in our modeling , dispersal phenotypes are assumed to be polymorphic , with three possible dispersal syndromes : dispersing , non - dispersing , and mixed , these last consisting in a combination of the other two .",
    "this polymorphism varies among individuals and is expressed as an intrinsic individual tendency to generate seeds / offspring of two different types : dispersing or non - dispersing , which is coded in a dispersal - propensity parameter @xmath0 .",
    "our model allows us to compute analytically and/or computationally for any given set of environmental conditions and inbreeding parameters the optimal value of @xmath0 , which determines the level of dispersal propensity or bet hedging .",
    "additionally , we also develop an evolutionary ( genetic ) algorithm that enables us to determine exactly what is the evolutionarily stable dispersal syndrome under diverse circumstances",
    ".    the results of these models show that environmental variability is a strong selective agent for dispersal and can facilitate the emergence of purely dispersing or mixed dispersal syndromes .",
    "the specific strategy that is selected for depends on the interplay between inbreeding depression and environmental variability , although mixed dispersal seems to be more favorable and robust under most circumstances .",
    "we present a simple and parsimonious individual - based model in which a population of plants develops in time through the processes of birth , reproduction , competition , and death .",
    "each individual / plant lives at a fixed site on a two - dimensional square lattice of size @xmath1 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are assumed to minimize contour effects . in order to account for local competition for resources and space , occupancy",
    "is restricted to a maximum of one plant per site ( see fig . [",
    "fig : model ] ) .    at each discrete",
    "time - step @xmath2 which represents a reproductive cycle , i.e. one year in the case of annual plants all occupied lattice sites are emptied , i.e. generations are assumed to be non - overlapping , and new plants emerge from existing seeds following some dynamical rules that we specify in what follows .",
    "each individual plant produces the same , fixed , number of seeds , @xmath3 , but these can be of two different types / morphs : `` dispersing '' and `` non - dispersing '' , respectively . dispersing seeds travel to distant sites for simplicity , we assume that they can end up randomly in any location within the lattice whereas non - dispersing seeds can only stay in the maternal or adjacent sites .",
    "the relative fraction of these two types is modulated by the so - called dispersal propensity parameter @xmath0 : with probability @xmath0 , each of the produced seeds is dispersing , or , complementary with probability @xmath4 , non - dispersing .",
    "initially , we take @xmath0 as a constant , while allowing for variability in other model parameters ( e.g. , the degree of inbreeding depression and environmental variability ) . in a second step ,",
    "we study the case in which @xmath0 is dynamically self - tuned in the community .        even if , for the sake of simplicity , we assumed that the reproductive output i.e .",
    "the total number of seeds produced by each individual plant is constant , fitness differs among maternal plants because the probability of establishment are constrained by environmental conditions and inbreeding depression and thus the actual contribution to the next generation is individual - dependent .",
    "each morph follows a different type of dynamics :    * dispersing seeds establish at a randomly selected site with a probability @xmath5 $ ] which is a fluctuating random variable assumed to depend upon environmental conditions and to be equal at each time step for all sites in the lattice or , alternatively , they can be lost with complementary probability @xmath6 . for simplicity , we take @xmath7 to be an uncorrelated random variable freshly extracted at each discrete time step with uniform distribution in @xmath8 $ ] with the constraint that @xmath9 . *",
    "non - dispersing seeds are assumed not to be influenced by environmental variability , but to suffer from inbreeding depression . in particular ,",
    "individual plants are equipped with an individual _ quality _ parameter @xmath10 , which is inherited by the seeds they produce .",
    "the actual establishment probability of non - dispersing seeds is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the maximal value it can take .",
    "the quality @xmath10 modulating the establishment probability is reduced by a factor @xmath13 every time there is selfing ( i.e. , a reproductive event resulting in a non - dispersing seed ) , or instead , it is reset to @xmath14 by outcrossing ( i.e. , when a dispersing seed is produced ) .",
    "we set @xmath15 for all individuals in the community .",
    "future , more complex approaches should include also environmental dependency in the probability of establishment of non - dispersing seeds .    after all reproductive events and establishments at each timestep ( year ) , only one seed is randomly selected for reproduction at each cell ( if the number of seeds in that cell is @xmath16 ) while the rest are removed from the community .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the current model is a parsimonious one , restricted to the simplest syndrome , i.e. , one in which the association between dispersal and mating is immediate and perfect and in which temporal environmental variability affects only dispersing seeds . to test the robustness of our results in the absence of of a perfect correlation between dispersal and mating , in appendix",
    "a we also study a more general scenario in which the probability of selfing is independent of the dispersal syndrome , but in which inbreeding depression affects seeds produced by individuals that mate with relatives proportionally to the kinship between mates .",
    "still , non - dispersing seeds produce plants that are more likely to coexist with their relatives , and are indirectly more affected by inbreeding than those individuals coming from dispersed seeds .",
    "consequently , the generalized model leads to results that are similar to those of the simpler version .",
    "given that all our computer simulations are run considering finite and closed populations , extinction is always possible even in cases with a relatively high stationary density as a consequence of demographic fluctuations .",
    "once all individuals have disappeared from the community , the system reaches a stationary state and remains quiescent indefinitely .",
    "note that , strictly speaking , other stationary states of the system are quasi - stationary ; i.e. they reach a steady state conditioned on the system not having reached the quiescent state in which the population goes extinct @xcite .",
    "extinctions can then be classified in two different categories :    * _ deterministic _ extinctions , which occur with certainty after a given characteristic time , which grows slower than linearly with system size ; these occur when the system lies at the `` absorbing '' phase .",
    "* _ accidental _ extinctions , which correspond to catastrophic demographic fluctuations , the probability of which rapidly decreases exponentially with system size .",
    "these only occur as a result of finite - sizes when the system is in its `` active '' phase .    in order to determine for a given set of parameter values in which phase the system lies",
    ", we measured computationally the mean - extinction time @xmath17 as a function of the linear system size @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath17 grows exponentially or algebraically with @xmath18 in the active phase , while it converges asymptotically to a constant value in the absorbing one .",
    "additionally , to measure the quasi - stationary density in an efficient way , we re - activated any iteration reaching the quiescent state ( i.e. , extinction ) by setting it to a small but non zero density ( i.e. , re - introducing by hand a few individual plants in the community ) .",
    "albeit admittedly ad - hoc , this computational trick allows us to avoid limiting our statistics to active realizations of the model , and leads to similar results than other more sophisticated exact methods @xcite .",
    "our working hypothesis is that , in unpredictable environments or when inbreeding depression is significant , mixed dispersal strategies ( @xmath19 ) might lead to higher individual fitness than either of the single phenotype syndromes . to test this , we first develop a preliminary study of the stationary density @xmath20 for different values of the dispersal parameter @xmath0 , while keeping all other parameters fixed .",
    "we find that for each choice of parameters , there exists a specific value @xmath21 for which the population density is maximized .",
    "however , selection for dispersal is frequency - dependent , which makes it impossible to approximate the ess using optimality criteria @xcite .",
    "consequently , we implemented an evolutionary approach in which @xmath0 is not a constant , kept fixed across the whole population but an inheritable variable . in particular , we defined a genetic algorithm similar to that of @xcite in which each individual has its own dispersal syndrome , as encoded in a specific value of its parameter @xmath0 ; this value is transmitted to its progeny with a stochastic ( gaussian distributed ) variation of zero mean and @xmath22 standard deviation . in biological terms , @xmath22 can be understood as the rate of mutation , recombination and other sources of variation in heritable traits across generations ( referred to as mutation rate hereafter ) . in this evolutionary version of the model ,",
    "individuals with low fitness tend to become extinct , while the space they leave empty becomes progressively occupied by fitter individuals ( individuals with a higher probability of establishment ) .",
    "the outcome is a population with some averaged ( quasi)steady - state density , @xmath20 , and a well - defined averaged value of @xmath0 across the community , that we call @xmath23 , and some variance around these mean values .",
    "this modeling exercise does not aim at representing a realistic evolutionary process .",
    "it is just an effective dynamic in which individuals in the population self - optimize their dispersal strategies across generations as a result of competition and mutation .",
    "as a first step , we studied the behavior of the population when it exhibited any of the two single phenotype syndromes , i.e. the value of the dispersal propensity parameter was fixed to either @xmath25 or to @xmath26 , respectively .",

    "our results support this idea and indicate that mixed syndromes can be advantageous due to the benefits of bet - hedging through multiple co - existing complementary strategies .    in all of our computational analyses , patch size was finite , and",
    "thus populations could possibly go extinct following stochastic demographic collapse relatively easily .",
    "more importantly , according to our models , population extinction was unavoidable , regardless of patch size , whenever inbreeding depression or extreme environmental variability occurred .",
    "in particular , dispersing syndromes led to accelerated extinction if the population was subject to adverse environmental conditions for several generations .",
    "these situations might or might not take place in real - world scenarios , where meta - population dynamics can buffer the effect of local extirpations through migration from other sources @xcite .",
    "however , even disregarding immigration , populations exhibiting mixed strategies had significantly longer extinction times , and these grew very fast with patch size .",
    "this result is likely contingent on temporal autocorrelation of the environment , and if the latter is positive , extinction is expected to be faster under unfavorable conditions for any given phenotype .",
    "however , even if no phenotype can guarantee unlimited survival in finite patches , expected extinction times are drastically enhanced if organisms display mixed dispersal syndromes .",
    "the dynamical / adaptive version of our model also supported the hypothesis that populations with mixed syndromes are more resilient . in this version of the model , dispersal propensity",
    "was not fixed but rather dynamically self - organized to its optimal value .",
    "results showed that mixed syndromes appeared to provide the highest population densities and the longest population life - spans . in our formulation ,",
    "non - dispersing had an intrinsic penalization for any non - null value of inbreeding depression . in spite of this relative advantage of the dispersing phenotype",
    ", pure dispersal was found to be the evolutionary stable strategy only if environmental unpredictability was low , especially if inbreeding depression was also low .",
    "other authors have predicted that mixed dispersal is adaptive in heterogeneous environments @xcite .",
    "our models indicated that this is indeed the case , but that the optimal dispersal strategy is also contingent on inbreeding depression , and that if the latter is significant and dispersal and mating are closely correlated , pure dispersers might have an advantage over mixed dispersers even in heterogeneous environments .",
    "even though environmental and genetic costs influence the evolution of dispersal , environmental variation appears nevertheless to be specially relevant for the emergence of mixed dispersal strategies , particularly when the requirement of a perfect correlation between mating and dispersal is released .",
    "this result might be seen as contradicting the findings of the model put forward by @xcite .",
    "these authors showed that mixed mating / mixed dispersal can become the ess when each type of propagule provides a clearly different advantage ; higher establishment in the case of non - dispersing , inbred seeds and lower sibling competition in the case of outbred , dispersing seeds , and these predictions are independent of environmental variability . in our models , sibling competition and other kin selection mechanisms",
    "are implicitly incorporated into the inbreeding depression term ( i.e. , they can be regarded as deleterious consequences of being in close proximity to kin ) , while environmental variability affects the probability of establishment of dispersing seeds alone .",
    "thus , our model can be in fact regarded as a corroboration of schoen and lloyd s findings @xcite ; mixed syndromes are beneficial when there are simultaneous costs to dispersal and coexistence with kin .",
    "however , our predictions deviate from schoen and lloyd s in that we anticipate a relatively wide range of conditions under which mixed dispersal can be selected for , and predict that , in the ( near ) absence of deleterious interactions with kin , costs of dispersal might be enough to select for mixed dispersal .    according to our more reductionist model",
    ", mixed syndromes provided the ess under environmental and mating conditions of high environmental unpredictability and/or low inbreeding depression .",
    "moreover , under those same conditions they had a significantly higher fitness than any other alternative phenotype .",
    "the results of the general model showed an even wider region in which mixed syndromes were favored , mostly due to the lesser influence of inbreeding depression .",
    "the purely non - dispersing syndrome was almost never found to provide an ess .",
    "moreover , the robustness of the optimal phenotypes was very high , as indicated by the low variation around the optimal ess .",
    "this well - defined optimal ess seemed to rule out even the emergence of non - dispersing syndromes in populations with multiple phenotypes . in the case of the more general model , relatively low values of @xmath0",
    "were observed under high environmental variation , but those values were always @xmath97 .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , as plants with monomorphic non - dispersal syndromes do exist .",
    "for instance , there are several taxa that produce all their seeds underground ( i.e. , geocarpic ) such as the peanuts ( _ arachis _ spp . ) , _ trifolium subterraneum _ or _ macrotyloma geocarpum _ and non - dispersal has been shown to be an ess by different models @xcite .",
    "according to these models , non - dispersing phenotypes are adaptive whenever the probability of establishment away from the maternal site is lower than within the maternal site ( i.e. , whenever there is local adaptation ) .",
    "we have not explored in detail these scenarios in our models .",
    "however , naively , one could anticipate that non - dispersal syndromes could emerge as ess by considering the extreme case in which @xmath98 and the inbreeding depression is negligible , @xmath99 or if the models allowed for purging or included a transmission advantage of selfing @xcite .",
    "however , although the adaptive value of limited dispersal needs further investigation , this sort of phenotype is rare in nature and might be seen as exceptional @xcite .    finally , it is important to note that the way in which we implemented evolutionary dynamics into our calculations provide just a simple way to define and measure the ess , rather than realistic evolutionary models .",
    "for instance , we assumed that both types of reproduction and dispersal have the same costs for the maternal plant and that the two types of propagules produce identical individuals in the absence of inbreeding depression or environmental variability .",
    "however , the empirical and theoretical literature have shown that non - dispersing and dispersing propagules require different resource allocation from the mother plant and can produce different progeny @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is possible that mixed syndromes are not easy to develop .",
    "it could be expected that the mutations necessary to generate a mixed system , i.e.,mutations from @xmath24 to @xmath100 would have high pleiotropic costs and be hard to gain .",
    "this sort of functional polymorphism entails the coexistence of two distinct phenotypes within a single individual , each phenotype comprising a suite of traits ( e.g. , flower and fruit tissues , architectural traits , etc . ) with their own development and maintenance particularities .",
    "however , a biologically plausible model able to incorporate these additional complexities is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "our results show that although dispersal can be selected for under a wide range of conditions , mixed dispersal syndromes should be favored in systems that are exposed to highly unpredictable environments .",
    "moreover , mixed syndromes seem to ensure the viability of populations for longer periods of time , particularly under limiting conditions of environmental variability and inbreeding depression .",
    "the models presented so far are based on a perfect correlation between dispersal and the mating system , as only non - dispersing seeds experience inbreeding depression . in this section ,",
    "we show that this condition can be relaxed , leading to qualitatively similar conclusions , i.e. , that mixed dispersal strategies are selected for by environmental unpredictability and enable population persistence in the presence of inbreeding and dispersal costs .    in a more general scenario ,",
    "we suppose that : ( i ) inbreeding modifies the quality of seeds , @xmath10 , regardless of their dispersal strategy , which modulates their establishment probability @xmath101 and @xmath102 , for dispersing and non - dispersing seeds respectively ; ( ii ) we assume that mating is more likely to occur between individuals that are spatially close . therefore , in the presence of inbreeding depression , the quality of the seeds produced by a plant is a function of its proximity to relatives and of its genetic similarity to these relatives , i.e. , if a plant coexists with its close relatives , it is likely to mate with them and to produce seeds of bad quality .",
    "assuming inbreeding depression is the product of multilocus interactions among many ( @xmath103 ) moderately or slightly deleterious alleles and that the number of said alleles that are homozygous in an inbred genotype will determine its fitness @xcite , the effect of inbreeding depression can be modeled as follows : given a plant @xmath104 , we compute the quality of its seeds , @xmath105 , as : @xmath106 where @xmath107 represents the average over the plant s immediate neighbors , @xmath108 is the inbreeding depression parameter ( see below ) , and @xmath109 is the minimum number of past generations in which individuals @xmath104 and @xmath110 have a common ancestor , i.e. , the degree of kinship between them , so that @xmath111 if they come from the same mother , @xmath112 for a common grandmother but different mothers , and so on . as eq .",
    "[ eq : genetic ] is not defined in the case of a plant with zero neighbors , we take a maximum inbreeding depression that still can be modulated by @xmath108 , imposing for such case @xmath113 .",
    "this means that in the absence of neighbors , selfing is complete and homozigosity maximal .",
    "however , if any neighbors are present , cross - pollination is assumed regardless of the kinship between individuals .",
    ". [ eq : genetic ] affects both dispersing and non - dispersing seeds , and therefore there is no assumed correlation between mating and dispersal .",
    "however , non - dispersing seeds produce plants that are more likely to coexist with their relatives , and , indirectly , become more affected by inbreeding than those individuals coming from dispersed seeds .    to understand the role of the new parameter @xmath108",

    "[ eq : genetic ] rapidly decreases to 0 , and @xmath116 ; this limit represents a situation in which individuals can coexist with close relatives without suffering inbreeding depression . on the other hand , high values of @xmath108",

    "however , under high values of @xmath108 we again observe that the populations surviving under stressful conditions exhibit mixed dispersal syndromes ( low density populations near the critical line in fig . [",
    "fig : ga_genetic ] ) . in spite of the large parameter region in which mixed dispersal constitutes the ess , purely non - dispersing syndromes ( @xmath121 ) are still not selected for under any parameterization , as evidenced by the absence of dark blue regions in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ga_genetic ] .",
    "it is worth noting that even though the generalized model presented here no longer assumes a perfect correlation between mating and dispersal , it still considers only the case of a discrete dispersal polymorphism ( i.e. seeds are either dispersed or implanted locally ) .",
    "additionally , only dispersed seeds are affected by environmental fluctuations .",
    "we leave for future research further generalizations of the model considering continuous rather than discrete dispersal kernels as well as more extensive parameterizations of environmental variability .",
    "in addition to the computational results described in the main text , we developed a mathematical model in order to better understand the mechanisms by which mixed dispersal affected population density and extinction time .",
    "this approach is , in essence , an analytical evaluation of the population average exponential growth rate of the computational model .",
    "this growth rate can be defined as : @xmath122 this quantity is negative for shrinking populations , positive for growing ones , or zero in the marginal or critical case ; therefore , the sign of @xmath64 can be regarded as an indicative proxy of the fate of the population .",
    "we calculated @xmath64 as a function of the environmental and inbreeding parameters for different types of homogeneous populations with a fixed value of @xmath0 : i ) single phenotype dispersing syndrome @xmath123 , ii ) single phenotype non - dispersing syndrome @xmath124 and iii ) mixed syndromes ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "the mathematical analyses can be performed under the following approximations :    * saturation effects which become important at large densities preventing the population from growing infinitely are neglected .",
