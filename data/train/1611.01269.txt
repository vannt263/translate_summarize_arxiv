    "@xcite considered rays passing a massive object sheathed in a distribution of cold , non - magnetized plasma with a power - law density distribution @xmath10 for integer @xmath11 , and presented detailed calculations of the effect of the plasma with @xmath12 on the pulse profiles of a central neutron star ( ns ) with two emitting polar caps . due to the dipolar magnetic field of the ns",
    ", the @xmath12 case was primarily investigated .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the consequences of low - frequency emission from a co sheathed in plasma with @xmath1 . for this case , the plasma term in the effective potential drops off more slowly than the schwarzschild vacuum term . when this occurs the diverging - lens behaviour of the plasma dominates for low - frequency rays , such that a potential maximum exists external to the stellar radius @xmath13 for sufficiently compact stars .",
    "thus , low - frequency radiation is affected by turning points of the effective potential , causing rays which would usually escape the surface of the co in the vacuum case to turn back towards the stellar surface .",
    "a wide range of other novel behaviour exists for rays that escape the co surface with frequencies @xmath14 .",
    "we define this frequency range as the escape window ( ew ) , and the trapped rays with @xmath15 are within the anomalous propagation window ( apw ) .",
    "ray trapping in the apw is analogous to the anomalous propagation of radio signals in the earth s atmosphere , and has profound effects on the appearance of a co to distant observers , such as reducing the apparent radius of a co as a function of frequency .",
    "in fact , the co appears to vanish entirely as the observed frequency approaches @xmath16 , effectively ` cloaking ' the stellar surface from a distant observer when observed at low frequencies .",

    "the rays that propagate through plasma that are visible to distant observers require @xmath72 everywhere along their trajectory . note that the plasma frequency at infinity is equivalent to the square root of the effective potential ( equation [ vdef ] ) with @xmath73 .",
    "this means that radially directed rays with sufficiently low asymptotic frequency will be absorbed since the index of refraction @xmath9 vanishes for rays at the asymptotic plasma frequency .",
    "these rays have absorption points rather than turning points .",

    "the dependence between the radius of the photon sphere and @xmath6 was discussed by @xcite in their work on black hole shadows in plasma . however , the effect has additional implications for objects with surfaces that produce low - frequency emission .",

    ", the circular orbit is within the stellar surface and all rays are generally free to escape to infinity with maximum impact parameter @xmath86 .",

    "the presence of the unstable circular orbit external to the stellar surface implies a maximum in the potential .",
    "therefore a ray escaping the co surface must have energy in excess of this maximum to escape and avoid a turning ( absorption ) point in the trajectory .",
    "thus , the effective potential maximum defines the lower limit of the ew , @xmath3 , which a distant observer detects as an asymptotic frequency @xmath93 this is the threshold frequency for rays to escape the stellar surface .",
    "the existence of the ew provides a constraint on the maximum compactness ratio of a co , @xmath94 .",

    ", we define the apw , in which the diverging effect of the plasma dominates ray propagation .",
    "the apw is the range of frequencies given by @xmath102 .",
    "since @xmath103 implies a potential maximum of @xmath104 , the apw is bounded from below by @xmath105 rays in the apw that are emitted by the co have frequencies larger than the local plasma frequency for radii @xmath106 , but below the asymptotic plasma frequency at @xmath78 required for escape .",
    "thus , these rays are effectively trapped in the environment of the co. rays in the apw reach a maximum distance @xmath107 where they encounter a turning point due to the potential barrier and subsequently reverse direction to curve back to the co surface .",
    "rays external to the circular orbit radius with frequencies in the apw that approach the co from infinity reach a minimum turning distance @xmath108 and are reflected away from the co by the potential boundary , returning to infinity . to find the external turning radius as a function of impact parameter ,",
    "let us consider the polynomial expression for the turning points @xcite , @xmath109 for a given @xmath44 , the solutions of equation [ turningptdef ] give the external turning points @xmath108 .",

    "the simplest example is a radially directed ray .",
    "using @xmath5 and setting @xmath73 eliminates the @xmath44 terms , giving @xmath112 however , as seen from the effective potential and equation [ asymplasmafreq ] , radially outgoing rays experience absorption at the turning points due to the plasma frequency .",
    "thus , rays are absorbed at @xmath113 , but all other rays with non - vanishing @xmath54 are free to propagate .",
    "we demonstrate the behaviour of trapped and deflected rays in the apw in fig .",

    "[ fig : traj_pot ] as the thick curved line .",
    "the fiducial rays are represented by the horizontal thin lines , with the absorption points @xmath113 marked as open circles , and the corresponding radii marked with vertical dotted and dash  dotted lines .",
    "the interior of the co is shown in both panels by the light grey area .",
    "thus , when observed at frequencies within the apw ( @xmath123 ) , the co is effectively ` cloaked ' from detection by distant observers .",
    "the maximum impact parameter for rays at and above the high - frequency end of the ew is found by setting @xmath76 in equation [ bdef ] , @xmath124 with emission angle @xmath125 for a ray that makes a grazing escape from the co surface .",
    "however , for cos sheathed in power - law distributions of plasma with @xmath1 , frequencies in the ew have the maximum impact parameter reduced since @xmath103 . at @xmath3 , the maximum impact parameter for rays to escape vanishes entirely , and",
    "the image of the stellar surface to a distant observer appears to be a single point .",
    "we call the maximum impact parameter in the ew @xmath126 .    in general , the maximum impact parameter is the limiting case for which equation [ turningptdef ] has a single solution .",
    "a ray with maximum impact parameter ( @xmath67 ) will enter the circular orbit at @xmath78 .",
    "thus , the maximum impact parameter is found by evaluating equation [ bdef ] at @xmath127 , @xmath128 however , this expression presents a difficulty since solving for @xmath78 from the potential derivative requires the angular momentum @xmath54 , which itself is limited by @xmath126 for escaping rays at a particular frequency .",
    "therefore , we propose to use the turning point relationship ( equation [ turningptdef ] ) directly to discover the maximum impact parameter given only @xmath129 and without a priori knowledge of @xmath78 explicitly .    for general @xmath1 , the solution of the turning point equation must be found using numerical methods since terms with fractional exponents will be present .",
    "analytical solutions exist for integer values of @xmath6 , however the homogeneous @xmath130 case simply reproduces the behaviour of a massive particle with mass @xmath131 @xcite , though the general procedure used below can also provide the analytical solution . for the remainder of this section",

    "* ) , the ukrainian t - shaped radio telescope in the range of @xmath194@xmath197 mhz ( utr-2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the murchison widefield array between @xmath198 and @xmath199 mhz ( mwa ; * ? ? ?",
    "extremely low frequency observations ( @xmath200 mhz ) are complicated by a number of effects , including scattering from the interstellar medium , radio frequency interference from man - made sources and transmission through the earth s atmosphere .",
    "below @xmath194 mhz radio signals are completely attenuated by ionospheric propagation effects . despite these difficulties ,",
    "anomalous x - ray pulsars have been studied at @xmath201@xmath202 mhz @xcite , and a large sample of pulsar light curves have been studied over a broad range of frequencies by lofar @xcite , down to as low as @xmath203 mhz @xcite .",
    "generally , a low - frequency turnover in the spectrum of radio pulsars is associated with a corresponding evolution of the pulse profile , related to processes occurring near the rest - frame plasma frequency above the polar cap @xcite .",
    "while many nss do not show evidence of such a turnover @xcite , this feature has been identified in a number of objects .",
    "for our purposes , we focus on the pulsars with a low - frequency turnover , such as psr b1133 + 16 @xcite , the millisecond pulsars j21450750 @xcite and j1012 + 5307 @xcite , as well as a handful of additional systems ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we do not suggest that lensing and plasma effects account for these observations in their entirety , but if components of the radio beam arise from emission near the surface of the ns , these components can be affected by joint effects of gravity and the surrounding plasma environment .    the square kilometre array ( ska ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is projected to be in operation by 2020 .",
    "the sensitivity of the ska will be vital for studying the emission properties of psrs and detecting new systems .",
    "however , extreme measures are required to overcome the fundamental limitations of low - frequency observations imposed by artificial and ionospheric sources of radio interference .",
    "a proposed solution has been to place an antenna array composed of a swarm of satellites in a lunar orbit @xcite . in principle",
    ", such a space - based radio telescope could be sensitive to ultralow frequencies in the range @xmath199 khz@xmath197 mhz , opening a new avenue of inquiry into the emission processes active in nss .",
    "in the vacuum case , all frequencies of electromagnetic waves are affected equally by the lensing effects of the schwarzschild metric . however , for a power - law distribution of plasma in the curved space ",
    "time around a co , the issue of whether a star is observable at a particular frequency is more subtle , since the apparent radius of the star is frequency dependent with respect to a distant observer .    to quantify the behaviour of rays as a function of frequency , we defined two frequency windows for power - law plasma distributions with @xmath1 : the ew is the window in which rays originating from the co surface can escape to a distant observer , @xmath204 , and the apw spans the frequency range @xmath205 . in the apw ,",
    "a family of rays exist that are emitted from and return to the co surface .",
    "these behaviours are dependent on the presence of a plasma that drops off more slowly than the @xmath206 contribution from the vacuum term in the effective potential .",
    "the frequency windows are found analytically for power - law distributions and have analytical expressions for integer @xmath1 , but must be solved numerically for non - integer values .",
    "the maximum impact parameter for rays in the ew is given as a function of frequency from analysis of the classical turning points of the effective potential .    finally , we studied plasma effects on the appearance of a co formed on the sky of a distant observer . for a range of angles on the surface of a co",
    ", we found the corresponding projection on the observer s sky .",
    "the solid angle subtended by the co appears to change apparent size when the observing frequency is increased . at frequencies much larger than the upper limit of the ew ,",
    "vacuum behaviour is recovered .",
