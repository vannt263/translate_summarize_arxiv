    "as we increase the nonequilibrium parameter @xmath101 from @xmath118 to @xmath119 , we noticed that the normalized current density has the highest peak for @xmath101 ( no hot electrons ) .",
    "as the hot electrons injection rate increases , the peak of the current density decreases and shifts to the left ( i.e. , low @xmath12 fields ) .",
    "this is caused by the scattering effects due to electron - phonon interactions as well as the increase in the direct hot electrons injection rate  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "the normalized current density ( @xmath120 ) of the cnts exhibits a linear monotonic dependence on the applied @xmath12 field ( @xmath0 ) at weak field ( i.e.,the region of ohmic conductivity ) when frequency of @xmath106 field @xmath1 is much less than scattering frequency @xmath2 ( @xmath3 or @xmath15 i.e. quasi - static case , where @xmath121 ) .",
    "as the applied @xmath12 field ( @xmath0 ) increases , the normalized current density ( @xmath120 ) increases and reaches a maximum , and drops off , experiencing a negative differential conductivity ( ndc ) for both the @xmath58- cnt and the @xmath106-cnt as shown in figures @xmath122 and @xmath123 , respectively .",
    "the ndc is due to the increase in the collision rate of the energetic electrons with the lattice that induces large amplitude of oscillation in the lattice , which in - turn increases the electrons scattering rate that leads to the decrease in the current density at high dc field  @xcite .",
    "similar effect was observed by mensah , et .",
    "@xcite in superlattice .",
    "as the injection rate of the hot electrons becomes strong enough , the current density up - turned , exhibiting a positive differential conductivity ( pdc ) near @xmath124 and @xmath125 for the @xmath58-cnt and the @xmath106-cnt , respectively . in this region ,",
    "the hot electrons become the dominant determining factor  @xcite .",
    "the physical mechanism behind the switch from ndc to pdc is due to the interplay between the hot electrons pumping frequency ( @xmath126 ) , which is a function of rate of hot electrons injection ( @xmath66 ) , and the bloch frequency ( @xmath100 ) , which depends on the @xmath12 field ( @xmath0 )  @xcite . at stronger @xmath12 field , the rate of scattering of the electrons by phonons is well pronounced resulting in the gradual decrease in the current density with increasing dc field ( ndc region ) .",
    "however , as the rate of hot electrons injection increases , the corresponding rise in the current density due to hot electrons injection now far exceeds the reduction in the current density due to scattering of electrons by phonons .",
    "thus , the net effect on the current density from the two opposing sources ( with the hot electrons being dominant ) gives rise to the pdc characteristics as shown in figure @xmath117 for @xmath127 .",
    "the desirable effect of a switch from ndc to pdc takes place when @xmath101 is larger than a critical value @xmath128 .",
    "when axial injection of hot electrons into achiral cnts is strong enough , the nonequilibrium parameter @xmath101 exceeds the critical value @xmath128 and the ndc characteristics change to the pdc characteristics .",
    "thus , the most important tough problem for ndc region which is the space charge instabilities that inevitably lead to electric field domains formation resulting in non uniform electric field distribution which usually destroys thz bloch gain can be suppressed due to the switch from the ndc behaviour to the pdc behaviour  @xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that pdc is considered as one of the conditions for electric stability of the system necessary for suppressing electric field domains  @xcite .",
    "hence a critical challenge for the successful observation of thz bloch gain is the suppression of electric field domains by switching from ndc region to pdc region .",
    "this is similar to that observed by mensah , et .",
    "@xcite in effect of ionization of impurity centers in superlattice . to put the above observations in perspective",
    ", we display in figure @xmath32 , a @xmath33-dimensional behaviour of the normalized current density ( @xmath120 ) as a function of the applied @xmath12 field ( @xmath0 ) and nonequilibrium parameter ( @xmath101 ) when frequency of @xmath106 field @xmath1 is much less than scattering frequency @xmath2 ( @xmath3 or @xmath4 i.e. quasi - static case , where @xmath129 ) for the cnts .",
    "the @xmath12 differential conductivity and the peak of the current density are at the highest when the nonequilibruim parameter @xmath101 is zero . for both @xmath58-cnt and @xmath106-cnt , as the nonequilibrium parameter @xmath101 gradually increases the @xmath12 differential conductivity and the peak normalized current density decrease until the critical nonequilibrium parameter value @xmath130 is reached , beyond which the ndc characteristics slowly changes to pdc characteristics as shown in figure 2 .",
    "we further display the behaviour of the normalized current density ( @xmath120 ) as a function of the applied @xmath12 field ( @xmath0 ) of @xmath13 driven fields as @xmath131 incrreasing from @xmath132 to @xmath133 when the nonequilibrium parameter @xmath134 ( presence of hot electrons ) and @xmath102(absence of hot electrons ) for @xmath9 @xmath58- cnt and @xmath11 @xmath106-cnt in figure @xmath33 .",
    "as we increase @xmath131 from @xmath132 to @xmath133 , we observed that the normalized current density has the highest peak at @xmath135 . upon increasing the @xmath131 , the peak current density decreases until the least peak is attained when @xmath136 .",
    "furthermore , we observed a switch from ndc to pdc near @xmath124 and @xmath125 for @xmath58-cnt and @xmath106- cnt respectively so far as @xmath15 ( i.e @xmath132 to @xmath133 ) .",
    "also the differential conductivity ( @xmath137 ) in ndc region is fairly constant as @xmath131 increases from @xmath132 to @xmath133 .",
    "however in pdc region after the switch from ndc , differential conductivity(@xmath137)fairly increases as @xmath131 increases from @xmath132 to @xmath133 as shown in figure @xmath138 and @xmath139 for zz - cnt and ac - cnt respectively . in the absence of hot electrons ( @xmath102 ) , we observed a shift of peak current density towards right ( i.e high dc - field ) as @xmath131 increases from @xmath132 to @xmath133 for each achiral cnt .",
    "hence , the current density dc field ( @xmath140)characteristics for cnts show a negative differential conductivity at stronger electric field without hot electrons and with strong enough axial injection of hot electrons ( i.e. @xmath141 ) , there is a switch from ndc to pdc leading to high electric field domain suppression necessary for generation of thz radiations provided @xmath15(i.e quasi - static ac field ) .",
    "in summary , we have analyzed theoretically that strong enough injection of hot electrons in a cnt under conditions where , in addition to the dc field causing ndc , a similarly ac field is applied with a frequency @xmath1 much less than that of the scattering frequency @xmath2 ( i.e. @xmath3 or @xmath15 , quasi - static case , @xmath121 ) , ndc switches to pdc .",
    "hence , strong enough axial injection of hot electrons in cnt under the influence of quasi - static ac field results in a switch from ndc to pdc leading to the suppression of the destructive electric domain instability , predicting a potential generation of terahertz radiations whose applications are relevance in current - day technology , industry , and research . although similarly effect has been observed in the absence of quasi - static ac field [ 37 ] , the differential conductivity ( @xmath137 ) is higher and also hot electrons injection rate beyond which there is a switch from ndc to pdc represented by critical noneqilibrium parameter @xmath142 ) is lower in the presence of quasi - static @xmath106- field than in the absence .",
