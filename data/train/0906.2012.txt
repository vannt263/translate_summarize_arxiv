    "the observed flux from a galaxy as a function of wavelength or frequency , its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , represents the integrated light of its stellar populations and is a valuable tool for determining properties such as its age , and current mass contained in stars .",
    "interpreting observations of galaxy seds requires creating synthetic spectra using our best understanding of stellar spectra , stellar evolution , and dust absorption .",
    "this process , known as stellar population synthesis ( sps ) was first implemented by tinsley ( 1967 , 1972 ) and has subsequently been refined into increasingly sophisticated models ( e.g. , bruzual 1983 ; renzini & buzzoni 1986 ; bruzual & charlot 1993 ; worthey 1994 ; fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ; leitherer et al .",

    "2008 ) . with the advent of deep multiwavelength extragalactic surveys and the refinement of photometric redshift techniques , large , statistically complete samples of galaxies with broadband seds are now available for studying the evolution of galaxy properties in a systematic way up to @xmath0 2 - 3 ( e.g. , frster schreiber et al .",
    "2004 ; labb et al . 2005 ; van dokkum et al .",

    "the demand for sps codes that provide accurate synthetic seds for a given parameter set is now greater than ever as they are @xmath7 tool for extracting astrophysical information from these data . using the current generation of sps models",
    "these studies have shown that a large fraction of the stellar mass ( m@xmath4 ) in massive galaxies is assembled by @xmath0 2 ( e.g. , fontana et al .",
    "2006 ; prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "2008 ; marchesini et al .",
    "2008 ) , and that a significant fraction of these galaxies are already passively evolving ( e.g. , labb et al . 2005 ; papovich et al .",
    "2006 ; kriek et al .",
    "unfortunately , the current sps models do have significant challenges to overcome ( see e.g. , conroy et al . 2008 ) , making it unclear how robust some of these results are ( see e.g. , the discussion in marchesini et al .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that stellar population parameters derived from fitting broadband seds suffer from systematic uncertainties caused by the fact that metallicity , the initial mass function ( imf ) , and dust extinction law can not be constrained by broadband seds alone . instead , these parameters must be assumed _ a priori _ when creating the set of synthetic seds used in the fitting .",
    "more recently it has become clear that the treatment of sps itself ( e.g. , the choice of isochrones , stellar libraries , and integration method ) can result in synthetic spectra that look strikingly different for a similar set of input parameters ( e.g. , maraston 2005 , maraston et al .",
    "2006 ; bruzual 2007 ; conroy et al . 2008 ) and that the choice of sps method is now an additional systematic error in the interpretation of galaxy seds .",
    "one of the major challenges for sps remains to be a complete treatment of the thermally - pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) stars .",
    "this population of stars are notoriously challenging to model because they have complex physics such as thermal pulses , evolving chemical compositions , rapid mass - loss rates , and self - obscuring dust shells ( see e.g. , marigo et al .",
    "2008 , and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , their lifetimes are short which means they are rarely found in clusters and therefore the majority of empirical spectra come from field stars of unknown metallicity ( e.g. , lanon & wood 2000 , lanon & mouchine 2002 ) .",
    "nevertheless , they can not be ignored in sps because they are bright in the rest - frame nir and can dominate the total nir luminosity of young stellar populations with ages between 0.2 to 2.0 gyr ( e.g. , maraston 2005 , bruzual 2007 ) .",
    "the treatment of tp - agb stars in sps modeling is now a key issue in the study of stellar masses , because the rest - frame nir also traces a galaxy s old stellar population and therefore represents its integrated star formation history ( sfh ) .",
    "if galaxies undergo multiple bursts of star formation ( sf ) at widely spaced epochs , the rest - frame nir becomes the critical wavelength range for determining stellar masses . for young galaxies at high redshift , sps codes with different treatments of tp - agb evolution can produce stellar masses and ages that systematically differ by roughly a factor of 2 for identical seds ( e.g. , maraston et al .",

    "the universe is young , @xmath6 3 gyr , and therefore the majority of observed galaxies contain the young stellar populations that should be dominated by tp - agb stars ; however , they have not yet acquired an underlying old stellar population that must be accounted for when studying tp - agb effects in the rest - frame nir in low redshift galaxies ( e.g. , riffel et al .",

    "these data constrain the galaxy s seds from the rest - frame uv to optical and k08 compared fits with and without the nir spectroscopy to determine how parameters determined from fitting broadband data alone compare with those determined with the higher resolution spectroscopy and spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "recently , we have obtained irac observations of this sample and this allows us to extend the sed modeling into the rest - frame nir . with deep photometry in 13 broadband filters ( ubvriz@xmath12jhk+irac ) as well as high - resolution nir spectroscopy that covers the rest - frame balmer/4000  break ,",
    "this sample of galaxies are likely to have the best - constrained seds of young massive galaxies at @xmath0 2.3 until more powerful optical and mid - infrared spectroscopic capabilities become available from ground - based 20 - 30 m telescopes and jwst , respectively . in this paper",
    "we explore how well the properties of these galaxies can be derived from their seds , with a focus on the rest - frame nir .",
    "specifically , we concentrate on four issues , 1 ) _ improvement in constraints and systematic errors : _ does irac data improve the constraints on stellar population parameters for @xmath0 2.3 galaxies , or does it increase the uncertainties because the models fail to correctly reproduce the rest - frame nir sed ?",
    "are there systematic errors in the stellar population parameters determined without the rest - frame nir data ?",
    "2 ) _ best - possible constraints : _ ignoring systematic effects such as metallicity , dust law , imf , and choice of sps code , what are the best - possible constraints on the stellar population parameters of individual galaxies we can expect from their seds alone ?",
    "3 ) _ comparison of sps codes : _ how well do the most - used sps codes describe the seds of young stellar populations in the rest - frame nir ? including the irac data , do any of the codes provide better fits to the data ? what are the systematic differences in parameters for individual galaxies using various sps codes , dust laws , and metallicities , and which of these effects is most significant ?",
    "4 ) _ are passive galaxies really passive ? _ approximately 50% of the galaxies in our sample show no emission lines in their spectra .",
    "do all of these galaxies have strongly suppressed star formation , or are some dusty star forming galaxies with enough dust to obscure the emission - line regions ? this paper is organized as follows . in @xmath13 2",

    "we assess the systematic effects from the various assumptions of dust law and metallicity compared to sps code in @xmath13 6 , and in @xmath13 7 we examine what fraction of the galaxies have strongly suppressed star formation based on their seds .",
    "we conclude with a summary in @xmath13 8 throughout this paper we assume a @xmath14 = 0.3 , @xmath15 = 0.7 , h@xmath16 = 70 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 cosmology .",

    "as pointed out by m05 , the pegase , starburst99 , and bc03 models use similar stellar spectral libraries , isochrones , and treatment of the tp - agb phase of stellar evolution . therefore ,",

    "although it is widely accepted that the kroupa ( 2001 ) and charbrier ( 2003 ) imfs are likely to be better choices for a universal imf ; we note that the galaxies in our sample are young and the main sequence turnoff mass is much larger than the mass at which these imfs differ , therefore , the choice between these imfs does not significantly affect the shape of the synthetic seds , only the normalization of the m@xmath4 .",

    "we find a systematic offset of 0.17 in @xmath43/(1 + @xmath23 ) and a scatter of 0.12 .",

    "most of the systematic offset in the @xmath38 is caused by the ecdfs galaxies ( hereafter the `` wide '' sample , following the convention from k08 ) . removing those from the sample (",
    "hereafter the `` deep '' sample ) the systematic offset is 0.00 and the scatter is 0.05 , comparable to the offset and scatter of 0.03 and 0.08 measured by k08 .",
    "we list the offsets and scatters measured for all datasets in table 2 .",
    "when the @xmath38 are computed with the u@xmath344.5@xmath10 photometry , there is no improvement in the offset and scatter .",
    "surprisingly , adding the 3.6@xmath10 and 4.5@xmath10 data does not even improve the @xmath38 of the wide sample ,",
    "which has the lowest s / n near - ir photometry .",
    "when we fit with the entire u@xmath348@xmath10 data the offset and scatter in the overall sample improve to 0.14 and 0.11 , respectively , and this overall improvement is caused primarily by improvement in the wide sample where the systematic offset is reduced by @xmath6 0.1 in @xmath24@xmath23 .",
    "for the deep sample the offset and scatter are 0.02 and 0.05 , comparable to what is found with just the u@xmath34k photometry .",
    "these comparisons show that the irac photometry does modestly improve the @xmath38 of galaxies at @xmath8 2 , but it does so only for galaxies with marginal s / n photometry in the optical and nir bandpasses , and only when all four irac channels are used . for galaxies with good",
    "s / n in the optical and nir bandpasses , there is no evidence for an improvement in the photometeric redshifts when irac data is included .",

    "for the deep sample without irac data the offset and scatter are 0.00 and 0.05 , respectively , and for the wide sample with irac data they are 0.35 and 0.17 , respectively .",
    "clearly deep nir data are more useful than irac data when determining the @xmath44 s of @xmath0 2.3 galaxies .",
    "this suggests that for this sample , the constraints on the @xmath38 are dominated by the location of the lyman , balmer or 4000  breaks in the seds , and that constraints from the 1.6@xmath10 bump are much weaker .",
    "the lyman , balmer and 4000  breaks are sharper features than the 1.6@xmath10 bump , and the optical and nir bands are closer spaced in wavelength than the irac bands , and therefore it is not surprising that this is the case .",
    "it is worth pointing out that although the @xmath38 of the 1.6 @xmath11 2.9 spectroscopic sample are not significantly improved with the irac data , this does not necessarily mean that irac data will not improve @xmath38 for a different sample .",
    "our k - selected sample is comprised primarily of massive galaxies , which are frequently red with strong balmer/4000  breaks .",
    "blue galaxies with a weak balmer break and the lyman break blueward of the observed u - band ( @xmath42 2.5 ) may see larger improvements in @xmath38 when irac data is included .",
    "examination of the seds in @xmath13 4.1 showed that when the irac data were included in the fits to the u@xmath34z@xmath12+nirspec data , the stellar population parameters of most galaxies remain consistent within the 1@xmath33 uncertainties .",
    "although consistent , the differences may be systematic , which could change the mean stellar population parameters of the sample . in this section we quantitatively",

    "this demonstrates that not only are the parameters determined by k08 consistent with those determined with the irac data , but that none of the differences serve to change the mean parameters of the sample in a systematic way .",
    "the mean values of most parameters determined using the broadband data are also consistent with those determined using the u@xmath348@xmath10+nirspec data .",
    "the only exception is m@xmath4 , which appears to be overestimated by a factor of @xmath6 1.3 ( 0.11 dex ) when only u@xmath34k photometry is used in the fitting .",
    "this systematic overestimate was also seen by k08 when they compared the m@xmath4 from fits to the u@xmath34k data to those from the u@xmath34z@xmath12+nirspec data . given that m@xmath4 determined with both the u@xmath348@xmath10+nirspec and u@xmath34z@xmath12+nirspec data are consistent , our fits support the k08 conclusions .",
    "as discussed in k08 , the systematic effect on m@xmath4 can lead to an overestimate of the number of massive galaxies at high redshift , and hence an underestimate of the evolution of the stellar mass density .",
    "interestingly , it appears that the systematic overestimate of m@xmath4 is removed when the irac data is included in the sed fits to the broadband data .",
    "elsner et al . ( 2008 ) also saw a systematic reduction in m@xmath4 when including irac data in sed fitting of broadband photometry of @xmath0 2 galaxies .",

    "in @xmath13 4.2 we showed that the @xmath44 were systematically overestimated for galaxies in the ecdfs field , and that the irac data reduced this systematic by @xmath6 0.1 in @xmath40@xmath23/(1 + @xmath23 ) . if we remove the ecdfs galaxies and compare the mean values of m@xmath4 from the u@xmath34k photometry again , we find that the systematic overestimate of m@xmath4 is reduced to a factor of 1.08 @xmath46 0.10 .",
    "this suggests that it is primarily the systematic overestimate of the @xmath44 , caused by low s / n jhk photometry that is responsible for the overestimate of m@xmath4 .",
    "given that wuyts et al .",

    "shapley et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggest it may be caused by contamination of their observed k@xmath47-band fluxes from h@xmath48 emission . in summary , our comparison shows that when comparing stellar population parameters determined with various permutations of the data , the only parameter that suffers a systematic bias at the @xmath49 10% level is m@xmath4 when determined using the u@xmath34k photometry .",
    "this bias can be removed by including either nir spectroscopy or irac data in the fitting because both improve the @xmath44 .",

    "this suggests that the irac data do not improve the accuracy for the majority of stellar population parameters . in this section",
    "we examine if including the irac photometry improves the uncertainties in the parameters determined for individual galaxies . a simple test",
    "is to compare the parameter uncertainties computed using the monte carlo method . while potentially informative , such a comparison requires the uncertainties themselves to be robust , even in the case of sparse data .",

    "we graphically summarize the result of the comparisons for the parameters m@xmath4 , @xmath2 , , a@xmath3 , and sfr , computed using the u@xmath34k , u@xmath348@xmath10 , u@xmath34z@xmath12+nirspec , and u@xmath348@xmath10+nirspec data .",

    "adding either the nir spectroscopy , the irac data , or the combination of the two significantly improves the uncertainties in all parameters .",

    ". why do the different types of data affect the parameters in these ways ?",
    "how can irac data improve sfr estimates , when it primarily traces the old stellar population ?",
    "although young - and - dusty and old - and - quiescent systems are difficult to distinguish with data that covers only the rest - frame uv to optical sed , they are separable once rest - frame nir data is available ( e.g. , @xmath13 4.1 , labb et al . 2005 ; williams et al .",
    "this is not because the nir wavelength range itself is particularly valuable , but because it completes the coverage of the part of a galaxy s sed that is dominated by light from stellar photospheres . in turn",
    "this improves the constraints on the a@xmath3 , because a@xmath3 changes the broad shape of the stellar sed . in the @xmath2-models",
    "the sfr is not a quantity that is fit for , instead it is inferred from the number of @xmath50-folding times ( @xmath22/@xmath2 ) , scaled by the m@xmath4 , and corrected for the a@xmath3 .",
    "improved constraints on a@xmath3 lead to better sfrs , and hence irac data actually improves estimates of sfrs from sed fitting .",
    "the nir spectroscopy adds both a @xmath41 , as well as high - resolution information on the sed near the balmer/4000  break . as shown by k08 , it is the high resolution information near the balmer/4000   break that drives the improvement in both @xmath22 and @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , the irac data still helps to improve the constraints on these parameters further .",
    "most likely this is because it traces the old stellar population , which in tandem with the optical data constrains the ratio of old stars to young stars , and hence the number of @xmath50-folding times , which is directly related to both @xmath22 and @xmath2 .",
    "perhaps the most remarkable result from figure 4 is that for our sample , the parameters m@xmath4 and sfr are as well - determined from the u@xmath348@xmath10 photometry and @xmath44 , as they are from the u@xmath348@xmath10+nirspec data and @xmath41 .",
    "this suggests that deep broadband photometry that extends into the rest - frame nir can potentially provide unbiased high - quality estimates of the m@xmath4 and sfr for massive galaxies at 2 @xmath11 3 .",
    "nir spectroscopy is extremely valuable for getting accurate rest - frame colors using @xmath41 ( e.g. , k08 ) , identifying agn ( e.g. , kriek et al . 2007 ) , and to provide an independent check on sfrs from emission line fluxes ( e.g. , erb et al .",

    "excluding the plgs , we can see that for the m05 models , very few galaxies have significantly higher @xmath32 values when the rest - frame nir data are included in the fit . for the bc03 and cb08 models , there are some non - plg systems where the fits are much worse when the rest - frame nir data is included ; however , there are only a handful of such galaxies .",
    "the most discrepant galaxies in the bc03 models are 1030 - 1531 , 1256 - 519 , and 1256 - 1967 .",
    "galaxy 1256 - 519 has a poor fit with the irac data in all models ; however , it is notable that 1030 - 1531 and 1256 - 1967 have @xmath55 flux in the rest - frame nir than predicted by the bc03 models and are better described by the m05 and cb08 models .",
    "interestingly , these two galaxies also have similar ages ( 0.47@xmath56 , and 0.45@xmath57 gyr ) from the m05 fits , and are right in the middle of the age range were emission from tp - agb stars is near the maximum for a range of metallicities ( e.g. m05 ) suggesting that the different treatment of these stars in the m05 and cb08 models is the cause of the improved fit .",
    "still , it is possible that these two galaxies could be modeled using a composite of young and old bursts with the bc03 code ( e.g. , yan et al .",
    "2004 ) , and with only two non - plg galaxies in the sample that would require such modeling to explain the sed , we suggest that there is only mild evidence at best from the @xmath32 s that the seds from the bc03 code require significant changes in the rest - frame nir in order to match the observed seds of our galaxies .",
    "this can also be seen in figure 9 where we plot the residuals from the seds fit using models from the three sps codes , corrected to the rest - frame .",
    "the solid line represents a running average of the 30 nearest points .",
    "the running average suggests that the bc03 models may underpredict the mean flux of the average galaxy in the wavelength range 1.0 - 1.8@xmath10 ; however , the difference is at most , 5 - 10% , conceivably within the allowable range of the uncertanties in the irac photometry .",
    "the residuals from the m05 and cb08 models do not show the same trend , suggesting that they may describe the rest - frame nir seds of these galaxies slightly better than the bc03 models .",
    "in summary , these comparisons show a few key results .",
    "most importantly , based on the frequency of lowest @xmath32 and the @xmath53 for all galaxies , we conclude that there is no significant evidence that any of the three sps codes we tested describe the complete rest - frame uv to nir seds of massive @xmath0 2.3 galaxies significantly better than the others . comparison of the @xmath53 s from fits with and without the rest - frame nir data suggest that the bc03 and cb08 models may describe the rest - frame uv to optical seds of the galaxies slightly better than the m05 models , but that the latter may fit the rest - frame nir better than the former .",
    "still , the differences in the @xmath53 between the models are always @xmath18 5% and are only significant by @xmath6 1.5@xmath33 at most .",
    "the residuals from the fits also seem to show that the m05 and cb08 models describe the rest - frame nir slightly better than the bc03 models , but again , the difference is at most 5 - 10% , and within the photometric errors .",
    "these comparisons suggest that it will be extremely difficult to refine the models based on the observed seds of young stellar populations at high redshift .",
    "mostly likely such constraints will have to come from other avenues such as nir spectroscopy of young stellar populations in the local universe ( e.g. , riffel et al .",
    "2008 ) or improved theoretical understanding of post main sequence stellar evolution ( e.g. , marigo et al .",
    "2008 ) , or both .",
    "although the three codes describe the overall shape of the seds of the galaxies equally well , the parameters of the best fit seds from the codes imply significantly different stellar populations for the same galaxies .",
    "in figure 10 we plot the sed parameters determined from the u@xmath348@xmath10+nirspec data using the m05 and cb08 models against those determined using the bc03 models as solid circles and open diamonds , respectively .",
    "the mean and median ratio of stellar population parameters determined with the m05 and bc03 models are listed in table 4 .",
    "the most significant difference between these models is in the median m@xmath4 . from figure 10 we can see that the median m@xmath4 from the m05 models is 0.63 that of the bc03 models , and appears to be a systematic offset , independent of the mass of the galaxy",
    "if we divide the galaxies into two samples , those with detected emission lines in the nir spectrum ( hereafter el - galaxies ) and those without detectable emission lines ( hereafter nel - galaxies ) the systematic change in m@xmath4 for both of these groups is 0.63 and 0.69 , respectively , nearly identical to the median difference of 0.63 for the whole sample .",
    "this offset in m@xmath4 is similar to those measured by maraston et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and wuyts et al .",
    "( 2007 ) who saw ratios of 0.58 and 0.72 , respectively . comparing the best fit values of @xmath2 between the models",
    "shows that the m05 models prefer slightly lower values , they have a median @xmath2 that is 0.75 that of the bc03 @xmath2 .",
    "this difference is driven mostly by the el - galaxies which have a @xmath2 of 0.66 times the bc03 value ; whereas the nel - galaxies have a @xmath2 0.83 times the bc03 value .",
    "this suggests that in the m05 models , the sfh of el - galaxies is burstier than for the bc03 models ; however , we note that @xmath2 is one of the poorest constrained parameters when fitting the seds alone . if we compare the   of the m05 models to the bc03 models we find that they are lower by a factor of 0.65 .",
    "again , this ratio is similar to the ratios of 0.58 and 0.51 found by maraston et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and wuyts et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , respectively . however , unlike m@xmath4 , the age differences are particularly pronounced between the el- and nel - galaxies .",
    "the ratio of ages of the nel - galaxies between the m05 models and bc03 models is 1.03 , but for the el - galaxies the ratio is 0.42 .",
    "the age of the stellar population is closely tied to the sfh , as the shape of the sed is primarily determined by the number of e - folding times of the sfh , which is effectively the ratio of @xmath22/@xmath2 .",
    "given that there are differences in @xmath2 between the models , a similar trend in @xmath22 and   is expected in order to preserve the number of e - folding times . due to these differences in @xmath2 and",
    "we also expect a significant difference in the sfrs for el- and nel - galaxies .",
    "the median ratio of sfrs is 1.12 ; however , it is 1.58 and 0.33 for el- and nel - galaxies , respectively ( the clear trend can also be seen in figure 11 ) . in the m05 models nel - galaxies have significantly less sf than the bc03 models",
    "would predict , whereas el - galaxies are more active than the bc03 models would predict , leading to a more bimodal galaxy distribution , if galaxies are classified by sfr .",
    "the final parameter we consider is the a@xmath3 of the galaxies .",
    "the median @xmath40a@xmath3 for the sample ( where @xmath40a@xmath3 @xmath58 a@xmath59-a@xmath60 ) is 0.0 ; however , @xmath40a@xmath3 = 0.1 for the el - galaxies , and @xmath40a@xmath3 = -0.4 for the nel - galaxies .",
    "the m05 models require far less dust to fit the nel - galaxies seds , and to first order this explains why the nel - galaxies have smaller m@xmath4 when fit with the m05 models , despite the fact that they have similar @xmath2 and  .",
    "maraston et al .",
    "( 2006 ) also showed that when fitting without dust the m05 models produce fits with significantly lower @xmath32 than the bc03 models , suggesting they require less dust to reproduce the seds of their sample as well . in summary , galaxies fit with the m05 models have a median values of 0.63@xmath61m@xmath4 , 0.65@xmath61  , and 0.75@xmath61@xmath2 with similar a@xmath3s and sfrs when compared to galaxies fit with the bc03 models , consistent with earlier studies .",
    "however , breaking the sample up into el- and nel - galaxies shows more interesting trends . in the m05 models el - galaxies have shorter timescales for sf and younger ages and",
    "this leads to sfrs that are higher by a factor of 1.58 .",
    "conversely , for nel - galaxies the values of @xmath2 and   are fairly similar between the m05 models and the bc03 models ; however the a@xmath3 is 0.4 mag less in the m05 models , and the sfrs are only 0.33 of the bc03 value .",
    "overall , the m05 models produce a more strongly bi - modal population of galaxies at @xmath0 2.3 .",
    "el - galaxies have a shorter - timescale for sf , and larger sfrs ; whereas nel - galaxies have less dust and are more quiescent .",
    "parameters determined from the cb08 models also have marked differences from those determined with the bc03 models .",
    "similar to the m05 models , m@xmath4 from the cb08 models is lower by a factor of 0.74 . dividing these into the el- and nel - galaxy categories we find that for the el - galaxies m@xmath62/m@xmath63 = 0.77 and nel - galaxies m@xmath62/m@xmath63 = 0.70",
    "this demonstrates that similar to the m05 fits , the differences in m@xmath4 are not a strong function of sed type and are a systematic offset between the models . of interest , this difference in m@xmath4 is less dramatic than the factor of 0.32 found by bruzual ( 2007 ) when fitting the galaxies used in maraston et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ; however , they compared m@xmath4 using fits without including dust extinction .",
    "clearly , once dust is included in the fitting the differences in m@xmath4 are not as significant .",
    "the median @xmath2 is similar between the cb08 and bc03 fits ; however , like the m05 fits , its dependence is strongly bimodal . in the cb08",
    "fits , the el - galaxies have @xmath2 s which are 0.66 that of the bc03 @xmath2 s .",
    "this behavior is similar to the m05 el - galaxies , which also have shorter sf timescales .",
    "the nel - galaxies actually have larger @xmath2 s in the cb08 models compared to the bc03 models by a factor of 1.25 . unlike the m05 models , the  of galaxies in the cb08 models are actually older than the bc03 models , with a median value 1.24 times larger .",
    "this dependence is again strongly bimodal , with the el - galaxies having a  0.96 times the bc03 models , but the nel - galaxies are older , with @xmath64 = 1.46@xmath65 .",
    "interestingly , this gives the same relative behavior as the m05 models , i.e. , the el - galaxies get younger _ relative _ to the nel - galaxies ; however , with the cb08 models it is the nel - galaxies that get older while the el - galaxies stay the same age . in the m05 models ,",
    "the el - galaxies get younger , but the nel - galaxies stay the same age . the median extinction is lower in the cb08 models compared to the bc03 models , being @xmath40a@xmath3 = -0.4 for all galaxies . the effect is stronger for nel - galaxies , which have @xmath40a@xmath3 = -0.6 , compared to the el - galaxies which have @xmath40a@xmath3 = -0.2 .",
    "overall , the net effect of using the cb08 models compared to the bc03 models is that the mean m@xmath4 of galaxies is lower by a factor of 0.74 , and perhaps more importantly , the galaxy population becomes more bimodal in several parameters .",
    "this is similar to the result from the m05 models ; however , the bimodalism is driven by movement in different types of galaxies . in the cb08 models compared to the bc03 models el - galaxies have lower @xmath2 s , but similar  s , giving them a slightly burstier sfh .",
    "this is different than the m05 models which are both significantly younger and have even smaller @xmath2 s . in the cb08 models the nel - galaxies have both longer @xmath2 s , older ages , and surprisingly , less dust . in the m05 models , the nel - galaxies had similar @xmath2 s , and   as the bc03 models . if we divide the galaxy population by sfr in both the m05 and cb08 model it is more bimodal than in the bc03 models . for the m05 models ,",
    "the change is dominated by the el - galaxies , which are notably younger and bustier with higher sfrs than their bc03 counterparts . for the cb08 models ,",
    "the bimodality is driven by the nel - galaxies which become older , with longer @xmath2 and smaller sfrs than their bc03 counterparts .",
    "as we have shown in the previous section , sed fits using the current generation of sps codes provide stellar populations parameters that suffer from significant systematic effects . in this section",
    "we quantify how large these systematic effects are relative to other known systematics such as the choice of dust law and metallicity .",
    "we allow three dust laws to redden the seds : the milky way ( mw ) and large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) dust laws determined by fitzpatrick et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) dust law determined by prvot et al .",
    "we also incorporate two new metallicities into the fits , a subsolar ( z = 0.2 z@xmath37 ) , and supersolar ( z = 2.5 z@xmath37 ) population . for the bc03 models these are the m42 , and m72 stellar populations , respectively . in an attempt to isolate variables",
    "we use the bc03 models as our control sps code . when comparing dust laws we assume solar metallicity as our control metallicity , and when comparing metallicities we assume a calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) dust law as the control dust law .",
    "it is possible that using a different control model will affect some of these comparisons ; however , the large number of potential permutations allowed in choosing the control model ( there are 36 possible combinations of sps code , dust law , and metallicity ) require us to chose only one in order to make the interpretation of systematic effects tractable .",
    "moreover , the most commonly used models for determining stellar population parameters thus far have been the bc03 models with solar metallicity and the calzetti dust law , so systematic changes in parameters relative to this model are probably the most interesting for understanding the implications of assumptions made in previous work .",
    "we first examine the effect of using the various dust laws on the parameter estimates .",
    "the ratios of parameters determined from fits using the smc , mw , and lmc dust laws compared to those from the bc03_m62+calzetti control model are listed in table 5 and are plotted in figure 11",
    ". the open red triangles and open blue squares represent the medians of the nel - galaxies and el - galaxies , respectively , and the black points denote the medians of the whole sample .",
    "the error bars on the black points denote the range spanned by 50% of the sample .",
    "figure 11 shows that when parameters determined using the lmc and mw dust laws are compared to those determined using the calzetti law , the only parameter that is significantly different is the a@xmath3 .",
    "parameters such as m@xmath4 , @xmath2 ,  , and sfr only change systematically by of order @xmath6 10% , and therefore appear to be robust regardless of whether the mw , lmc , or calzetti dust laws are used .",
    "furthermore , the changes do not appear to depend on the el- and nel - galaxy classification . as pointed out by frster schreiber et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the lack of significant changes in parameters between these three dust laws is not surprising because they are fairly similar in shape .",
    "the only notable difference is that the calzetti law lacks the 2175  absorption feature and that the ratio of total to selective absorption is slightly higher , r@xmath3 = 4.05 , compared to r@xmath3 = 3.1 for the mw and lmc laws .",
    "using the smc dust law does cause some significant changes to several parameters .",
    "the median @xmath2 and   are larger by a factors of 2.5 , and 2.8 , respectively , and the median a@xmath3 is lower by 0.4 mag .",
    "the median sfr is similar ; however , this results from a coincidental cancellation caused by the nel - galaxies having sfrs a factor of @xmath6 2 higher , and el - galaxies having sfrs a factor of @xmath6 2 lower .",
    "the smc dust law has by far the strongest attenuation of all four dust laws at @xmath52 @xmath18 is 2000  rest - frame and therefore it requires stellar populations with more rest - frame uv flux to describe the seds .",
    "this leads to a preference for longer timescales for sf and older ages so that there is a contribution from both a young and old population simultaneously . because of the shape of the smc dust law , the fits prefer intrinsically redder stellar populations ( i.e. , those with older ages and longer @xmath2 ) and less dust , rather than short bursts with more dust .",
    "the preference for older ages and less dust would probably diminish if we used the smc law with a subsolar metallicity population , which is intrinsically bluer and would allow for more dust and shorter timescales for sf .",
    "next we examine the effect on the parameters caused by varying the metallicity while holding the sps model and dust law fixed .",
    "the median values of the parameters determined from those fits compared to the control models fits are listed in table 6 and are also plotted in figure 11 .",
    "the choice of metallicity affects more parameters than does the choice of dust law ; however , it is still a modest effect .",
    "the @xmath2 of the stellar populations is lower for both metallicities ; however , the dependence for el- and nel - galaxies is reversed .",
    "the a@xmath3 depends on metallicity in the predictable way , with subsolar metallicity requiring more dust , and supersolar requiring less .",
    "perhaps what is most interesting about the variations in parameters caused by choice of dust law and metallicity is that other than the smc dust law , their net systematic effect on m@xmath4 , and  , the two parameters that are the best - determined using sed fitting ( @xmath13 4.5 ) is fairly small , @xmath6 10 - 20% .",
    "they do have larger effects on @xmath2 and sfr ; however , these are the parameters that are most poorly determined using the sed fitting .",
    "one disconcerting aspect of figure 11 is that it shows clearly that it is the sps codes that have the largest systematic effects on most parameters , and most importantly , that _ the largest systematic changes occur on the parameters that are best determined by the sed fitting _ : m@xmath4 ,  , and a@xmath66 .",
    "so , despite the fact that using the best data currently available we can constrain the m@xmath4 ,  , and a@xmath3 of individual galaxies to @xmath6 0.1 dex , 0.3 dex , and @xmath46 0.3 mag , respectively ( @xmath13 4.5 ) , it appears that systematic errors in these parameters from the various sps codes dominate over random errors for all three parameters as they cause systematic uncertainties of roughly @xmath46 0.3 dex in m@xmath4 and  , and @xmath46 0.4 mag in a@xmath3 .",
    "this suggests than unless these systematic discrepancies between the sps models are resolved , more multiwavelength data on the stellar component of the galaxy sed will not provide better constraints on the evolution of the stellar mass density in the universe , or the peak epoch of the formation of stars in the universe .",
    "longer wavelength data that probes emission from dust ( e.g. , mips , alma ) will almost certainly improve the sfr estimates ; however , parameters determined from the stellar sed are now limited by systematic errors . adding to the challenge",
    "is the analysis in @xmath13 5.2 that shows that even with the best constrained seds of young stellar populations currently available we will not be able to `` fit out '' these systematic problems , as all three models describe the seds equally well .",
    "using this sample of galaxies kriek et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have argued that @xmath6 50% of k - selected galaxies at @xmath0 2.3 have strongly suppressed star formation based on their lack of observed emission lines and the fact that the rest - frame uv through optical sed was best described by an old quiescent population . although they had the high - resolution nir spectroscopy with which to model the stellar populations , kriek et al .",
    "lacked the rest - frame nir data from irac , without which it can be challenging to distinguish between young - and - dusty and old - and - quiescent populations ( e.g. , labb et al .",

    "2007 , @xmath13 4 ) .",
    "although unlikely , they could not completely rule out the possibility that some fraction of the systems without emission lines could be highly extincted star forming galaxies rather than old and quiescent galaxies , and that the lack of emission lines and red optical colors are the result of significant dust obscuration . here",
    "we examine the stellar populations from the sed fits of the el and nel galaxies to verify that the seds of the galaxies without emission lines are still consistent with them being systems with strongly suppressed star formation . in the top panels",

    "the sps codes have the largest systematic effects on m@xmath4 and sfr , and therefore we plot three versions of the diagram in figure 12 , one each for values determined using the three sps codes .",
    "it is clear from figure 12 that the majority of galaxies without emission lines are found at the lowest ssfrs , whereas those with emission lines are found at the highest ssfrs .",
    "there are some notable model - dependent differences , with the m05 and cb08 models implying that the population of galaxies at @xmath0 2.3 has a more bimodal distribution of ssfrs , whereas the bc03 models suggest more of a continuum in ssfrs .",
    "this is apparent in the bottom panels of figure 12 , where we plot histograms of the ssfrs .",
    "if we adopt the kriek et al .",
    "( 2008b ) definition of quiescent systems as those that have ssfrs @xmath18 0.05 gyr@xmath17 ( i.e. , those that will increase their m@xmath4 by @xmath18 5% in the next gyr if the sfr remains at the same value ) , then we find that 13 , 17 , and 22 of the 34 galaxies ( 38%@xmath4612% , 50%@xmath4615% , 65%@xmath4618% ) would be classified as quiescent based on the sed parameters from the bc03 , m05 , and cb08 models , respectively .",
    "these numbers are in good agreement with the 45@xmath67% determined by kriek et al .",
    "( 2006 ) based on the fraction of galaxies without emission lines and sed fitting .",
    "despite the good agreement , there are a few subtle issues in the emission line classification .",
    "there are 16 galaxies without emission lines , and of these , 10 , 12 , and 15 of these would be considered quiescent based on their sed parameters from fits to the bc03 , m05 , and cb08 models , respectively .",
    "therefore , the majority of systems without emission lines are quiescent ; however , there is a non - negligible population ( @xmath6 6% - 33% ) of galaxies without emission lines that do have some ongoing obscured star formation ranging from @xmath6 10 - 850 m@xmath37 yr@xmath17 . coincidentally ,",
    "these few galaxies are canceled out in the overall quiescent fraction by a small fraction of emission line galaxies that are likely to be quiescent based on their sed , but probably have an agn component that is responsible for the emission lines . taken together ,",
    "these results suggest that the classification of @xmath8 2 galaxies into star forming and quiescent categories based on the presence / lack of emission lines and without any information on their sed is probably correct for the majority of systems ( @xmath6 70 - 90% ) ; however , there is some cross contamination between the two categories from dusty star forming galaxies without emission lines , and quiescent galaxies with an emission line agn . within our sample",
    "these two populations appear to be small , and equally abundant and therefore cancel each other when estimating the quiescent fraction . as a result ,",
    "the fraction of quiescent galaxies is roughly the same using the sed fits or the emission line classification .",
    "our sample is fairly small , so it is not clear if the same cancellation would occur for larger samples .",
    "although the contamination in the emission line classification suggests we should appeal to the sed fits for a more robust classification , that method is not completely `` clean '' either : the quiescent fraction ranges by roughly a factor of 2 depending on which sps code is used to model the seds . considering this systematic effect and using the 1@xmath33 confidence intervals from the models",
    ", we can conclude that the fraction of k - selected galaxies at @xmath0 2.3 that are classified as quiescent based on their seds ranges from as low as 26% to as high as 83% at 68% confidence , in good agreement with the value determined from the emission line fraction by kriek et al .",
    "clearly this uncertainty is large ; however , even within our modest sample of 34 galaxies , the statistical uncertainties are already smaller than the systematic uncertainty from the sps codes .",

    "it is enticing to prefer sps models that show the same bimodality in ssfrs as in rest - frame color ; however , given that the current sample is small , and the random uncertainties in the ssfrs are large ( factor of 2 - 3 ) it is better to defer such a comparison to a larger sample of galaxies ( e.g. , van dokkum et al .",

    "are still uncertain to factors of 2 - 3 . using only the broadband data ( u@xmath348@xmath10 ) as well as @xmath38 , the constraints on m@xmath4 , , and a@xmath3 are @xmath46 0.11 dex , @xmath460.36 dex , and @xmath460.3 mag , nearly as good as when the nir spectroscopy is included in the fitting .",
    "comparison of the quality of fits provided by the bc03 , m05 , and cb08 models using several methods shows that all three provide equally good descriptions of the data .",
    "there is tenuous evidence that the bc03 and cb08 models describe the rest - frame uv through optical sed slightly better than the m05 models ; however , the latter models may provide a slightly better description of the rest - frame nir sed .",
    "taken together , there is little evidence that one set of models provides an overall better description of the seds of young massive galaxies based on the quality of fit .",
    "furthermore , given that the differences in the predicted fluxes of the best - fit models at all wavelengths is @xmath185% , it is unlikely that the current generation of data on the seds of young , massive galaxies can inform the models enough to aid in their improvement .",
    "comparison of the systematic changes in stellar population parameters determined using the three sps codes shows that when we fit with the m05 models the m@xmath4 and  of galaxies go down by factors of 0.63 and 0.65 , respectively relative to the bc03 fits .",
    "galaxies fit with the cb08 models have 0.75 the m@xmath4 of the bc03 fits , but are on average older by a factor of 1.24 .",
    "notably , the changes in most parameters appear to depend on whether galaxies have detectable emission lines . because they affect the sfrs rates of sf and nel - galaxies differentially , both the m05 and cb08 models provide an overall stellar population that has `` burstier '' episodes of star formation than the bc03 models , as well as suggest a galaxy population that is more bimodal in terms of the overall ssfrs . 7 .",
    "comparison of systematic changes in stellar population parameters caused by choice of dust law , metallicity , and sps code show that the latter are the most significant of the three .",
    "the systematic effects on m@xmath4 , and , the best determined parameters from the sed fitting , from different dust laws and metallicities are generally small , of the order of 10 - 20% on m@xmath4 , and .",
    "conversely , the systematic effects from the sps code on these parameters are most significant .",
    "these systematic effects are larger than the random errors from the sed fitting and suggest that further progress in determining the evolution of the stellar mass density and the peak epoch of sf in the universe will require significant improvements in the models .",
    "comparison of the ssfrs determined using the sed fitting for galaxies with and without detectable emission lines shows that most galaxies without emission lines are quiescent ( 66% to 96% depending on sps model ) ; however , the remainder are likely to star forming galaxies that have obscured emission lines . in our sample ,",
    "the obscured emission line population is roughly equal to the population of galaxies that are quiescent based on their sed , but @xmath69 detected emission lines , probably from an agn . therefore , despite some small cross contamination of quiescent and active galaxies in the emission line and non - emission line categories , respectively , the overall fraction of k - bright , @xmath0 2.3 galaxies that would be considered quiescent based on their sed is @xmath6 50% ( 26% - 83% depending on sps model ) , nearly identical to the fraction without emission lines .",

    "in figure 13 we plot histograms that show the distributions of parameters determined with the u@xmath34k , u@xmath34z@xmath12+nirspec , and u@xmath348@xmath10 data relative to those determined with the u@xmath348@xmath10+nirspec data . the mean and median of each distribution",
    "is listed in the upper right of each panel .",
    "these demonstrate the systematic differences in the parameters with various datasets relative to the u@xmath348@xmath10+nirspec data , and are the parameters listed in table 1 .    the standard deviation ( @xmath33 ) of the distributions",
    "are listed in the upper right of each panel in figure 13 .",
    "these serve as an indication of the scatter between the best fit parameters , even though some of the distributions are non - gaussian .",
    "standard deviations are sensitive to large outliers and therefore we also compute the normalized median absolute deviation ( @xmath70 ) to compare if the @xmath33 is representative of the true scatter in parameters or is dominated by a few large outliers . for a gaussian error distribution , @xmath70 = rms . because the histograms are ratios of parameters computed with different datasets , the scatter is caused by the combination of errors in both datasets . to determine whether the given data improves the quality of the fits we must assess how much of the scatter is caused by uncertainties in u@xmath34k , u@xmath34z@xmath12+nirspec , or u@xmath348@xmath10 fits and how much is intrinsic to the sed fitting with the comparison sample ( u@xmath348@xmath10+nirspec ) .",
    "the intrinsic contribution is estimated by simulating a new distribution of the u@xmath348@xmath10+nirspec fit parameters based on the error estimates listed in table 1 .",
    "we generate this distribution by drawing 200 new values of each parameter , for each galaxy , using the uncertainties and compare the new parameters to the original ones .",
    "the resulting `` expected '' distributions are plotted in blue in figure 13 with the measured mean , median , @xmath33 and @xmath70 also listed in blue .",
    "these values are the scatters used on the x - axis of figure 13 . where the grey and blue histograms differ in mean , median , or sigma , the irac data provides additional constraints .",
    "the main results from the histograms in figure 13 are summarized in @xmath13 4.3 and @xmath13 4.4 .",
