    "<S> we derive closed expressions for the nuclear breakup cross sections in the adiabatic limit using the austern - blair theory . </S>",
    "<S> these expressions are appropriate for the breakup of weakly bound nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of an exit doorway that mediates the coupling between the entrance channel and the breakup continuum is used . </S>",
    "<S> we prove the validity of the scaling law that dictates that the nuclear breakup cross section scales linearly with the radius of the target . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare our results for the nuclear breakup cross section of @xmath0be , @xmath1b on several targets with recent cdcc calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> the breakup of nuclei is a common occurance when the bombarding energy is high enough and/or the binding energies are sufficiently low . in the case of weakly bound nuclei the threshold for breakup is small and more so for bound unstable nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism of breakup is assumed to consist of elongating the projectile , through the action of the interaction , which eventually leads to the production of two or more fragments . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction is composed of a short range , nuclear piece and a longer ranged electromagnetic one . </S>",
    "<S> a debate has been going on in the literature concerning the way the nuclear part of the breakup cross section depends on the mass of the target nucleus which supplies the interaction . in most references @xcite , it is assumed that the dependence goes as the cubic root of the mass number . in reference </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , however , it is claimed that this dependence is more like linear ! in a recent paper @xcite , through a careful continuum discretized coupled channels ( cdcc ) calculation , the former dependence ( a@xmath2 ) has been established , which corroborates the contention that the nuclear breakup cross section should follow the prediction of the serber model @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to compare the numerical cdcc calculation alluded to above with those of simpler analytical models . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the ausern - blair adiabatic theory for inelastic scattering comes to mind . </S>",
    "<S> if one assumes that the breakup proceeds through a so - called exit doorway @xcite , then the process can be treated as an inelastic excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of exit doorway has been used in the case of the influence of breakup on fusion @xcite and in the excitation of giant resonances @xcite with success . in a very recent paper </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a comparison of a preliminary cdcc calculation for the breakup cross section of the system @xmath3he@xmath4al at low bombarding energies with a simple formula derived by us]using the austern - blair model , showed that such an idea is quite reasonable and encouraged us to pursue the matter further . we do this in the present paper , where we fully develop the austern - blair model for the nuclear elastic breakup reaction cross section assumed to proceed through the excitation of an exit doorway @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the exit doorway concept has been used in the devolopment of reaction theories invloving the the excitation of a `` doorway '' in the final state , in contrast to the conventional cases where such resonances are populated in the entrance channel @xcite . in the breakup reactions of halo nuclei </S>",
    "<S> one may envisage that the process proceeds through the breakup doorway dipole , quadrupole etc . ) into the continuum . </S>",
    "<S> as such , the detailed description of the exclusive reaction , where the final channels are especified , will necessarily contain the full information about the exit doorway ( its energy , width etc . ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case that was encountered in the theory of the excitation of multiple giant resonances @xcite and of the influence of the pygmy resonance on the fusion of halo nuclei @xcite . in the current paper </S>",
    "<S> we will be content with the inclusive quantity of the integrated breakup cross section and the only reference to the exit doorway is made implicitly as a final state that has to be populated for breakup to occur .    </S>",
    "<S> the full hamiltonian which describes the colliding ions can be written as    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is diagonal in open channel space , @xmath7 is the intrinsic part that describes the structure of the projectile and the target nuclei , @xmath8 is the kinetic energy operator and @xmath9 is the optical potential which contains the complex nuclear plus the coulomb parts . </S>",
    "<S> the operator @xmath10 describes the coupling among the open channels .    </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic hamiltonian @xmath7 , which for simplicity is taken here to represent the excitable projectile nucleus with the target considered structureless , is now written as :    @xmath11 + \\nonumber \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> \\sum_{ij}[|i>\\omega_{ij}<j| + cc ]                 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first three terms on the rhs above refer to the ground , exit doorway and discretized continuum states , respectively . the fourth term couples the doorway to the discretized continuum states , and the last term represents the continuum - continuum coupling . </S>",
    "<S> if we remove the doorway from the above we get the continuum disctretized coupled channels ( cdcc ) intrinsic hamiltonian    @xmath12 + \\nonumber \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> \\sum_{ij}[|i>\\omega_{ij}<j| + cc ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the exit doorway modulated cdcc hamiltonian , eq . ( 2 ) , is our subject of study here . a full development of this new cdcc will be left for a future work . </S>",
    "<S> here we concentrate our effort on understanding the consequence of reaching the breakup continuum from the entrance channel only through the exit doorway @xmath13 . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we ignore the last term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) and remind ourselves that , whereas @xmath14 and @xmath15 are eigenstates of @xmath7 , @xmath13 is not .    the full doorway - modulated cdcc equations can be obtained as follows . </S>",

    "<S> would result in a more complicated expression for @xmath28 than that of eq.[alfa ] .    </S>",
    "<S> equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) can be recast into the following , after setting @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xmath32    the breakup cross section , within the exit doorway model then becomes , @xmath33    where the sum over @xmath34 has been performed by appropriate contour integration over @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the q - value in @xmath36 is complex owing to the non - zero width of the exit dooway whose energy is @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> a simple way to see how the complex q - value arises is to eliminate @xmath38 in eq.(5 ) in favor of @xmath39 by employing eq.(6 ) , which gives @xmath40 . with this eq.(5 ) becomes @xmath41 . with the exit doorway hypothesis , the polarization potential contribution , @xmath42 becomes @xmath43 this suggests defining the exit - dorway scattering wave function by setting @xmath44 such that eqs.(10 ) and ( 11 ) become : @xmath45 @xmath46 the `` inelastic '' cross - section is thus given by eq.(13 ) above with the aforementioned proviso that the q - value of the excited state is complex . </S>",
    "<S> the width of this q - value is a measure of the continuum contribution to the coupling .    at this point </S>",
    "<S> we comment on the inclusion of the continuum - continuum coupling , namely the last term in eq.(3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in this situation the amplitudes @xmath47 are obtained by matrix diagonalization and , among other things , the resulting overlap probability @xmath28 , deviates from the breit - wigner form of eq.(8 ) . a possible form which may incorporate </S>",
    "<S> some of the c - c effects is a lorentzian : @xmath48 the above form results in an equation for @xmath49 with a modified form factor which depends on the position and width of the exit doorway @xmath50 where @xmath51 is generally complex . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly the cross - section would be : @xmath52 . in the limiting case of @xmath53 , the factor @xmath51 </S>",
    "<S> is approximately given by @xmath54 resulting a cross - section given by : @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> in the case of coupling to the breakup continuum considered here , the other limit , @xmath56 is more appropriate , as @xmath57 is roughly given by the q - value of the breakup ( @xmath58mev ) while @xmath59 measures the extent in continuum excitation the discretization is performed ( @xmath60 mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath51 can be calculated in such a situation , but we leave this for a future investigation . the important point we are making here , is that a dwba calculation with complex excitation energy in the final state , and with a form factor of the type @xmath61 , should be an adequate candidate to treat the elastic breakup process .    in the following </S>",
    "<S> we take the exit doorway to be excited sates of different multipolarities and use the austern - blair sudden / adiabatic theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we employ the distorted wave born approximation for @xmath39 and @xmath36 .    the elastic breakup cross section and its dependence on the target masss can be analysed within the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) . </S>",
    "<S> if we treat the breakup as an inelastic multipole process , the amplitude @xmath62 would look like :    @xmath63    the unpolarized cross section of the dipole transition is then obtained from the expression    @xmath64    the radial integrals @xmath65 for pure nuclear excitation are given by , @xmath66 where the form factors @xmath67 are given by the following expressions for the monopole,@xmath68 , dipole , @xmath69 and quadrupole excitations @xmath70 @xcite ,    @xmath71 & & \\\\ f_1(r)=-\\delta_1^{(n)}(\\frac{3}{2 } ) ( \\frac{\\delta r_p}{r_p})[\\frac{dv(r)}{dr}+(\\frac{r}{3})\\frac{d^2v(r)}{dr^2 } ] & & \\\\ f_2(r)=-\\delta_2^{(n)}\\frac{dv(r)}{dr } & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath72 being the difference between the rms radii of the neutron and proton distributions of the projectile , and @xmath73 is the elastic scattering channel optical potential . </S>",
    "<S> the quantities @xmath74 and @xmath75 can be extracted from the analysis of refs.@xcite . in ref.@xcite </S>",
    "<S> a power expansion in @xmath76 was employed in the analysis of @xmath77-inelastic scattering from neutron skin nuclei .    in the adiabatic limit , @xmath78 , and for large orbital angular momenta , @xmath79 , the radial integral </S>",
    "<S> can then be evaluated in closed form following the procedure of austern and blair @xcite . for the dipole and quadrupole cases we have @xmath80    where @xmath81 is </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear deformation length given by @xmath82 with @xmath83 being the nuclear deformation parameter and @xmath84 is the radius of the excited projectile .    </S>",
    "<S> the above expression for the radial integrals can be associated with the nuclear elastic breakup radial integral . </S>",
    "<S> thus we can obtain analytical expression for the integrated nuclear breakup cross section by simply integrating the cross section formula , eq.(2 ) . in performing this calculation the angular momentum </S>",
    "<S> coupling coefficients are evaluated exactly and the sum over @xmath85 can be performed by putting the coulomb phase shifts both as functions of @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 13 ) is given now by @xmath87 with the condition that @xmath88 if @xmath89 is odd . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated pure nuclear breakup cross section containing dipole and quadrupole contributions then becomes the following    @xmath90   \\sum_{l=0}^\\infty(2l+1)|\\frac{ds^{(n)}(k)}{dl}|^2\\ ] ]    where terms proportional to the second derivative of @xmath91 have been dropped .    </S>",
    "<S> a simple estimate of the above formula can be made by approximating the sum in @xmath92 by an integral in @xmath93 : @xmath94    assuming a real nuclear s - matrix which depends on @xmath95 through @xmath96^{-1}$ ] then the derivative of @xmath97 would peak around the grazing angular momentum @xmath98 with a width given by @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> the integral  ( [ i ] ) is then obtained as : @xmath100 for @xmath101 . using @xmath102 @xmath103 , with @xmath104 and @xmath105 being the diffuseness of the optical potential we find the simple formula for @xmath106 .    </S>",

    "<S> it is clear that @xmath106 depends linearly on the radius of the target and , more importantly on the square of the nuclear dipole and quadrupole deformation lengths . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the @xmath110dependence is established .    in the calculation to follow we use the cluster model to calculate de deformation lengths for the different multipolarities @xcite this model assumes that the projectile is composed of two clusters , a core of mass and charge @xmath111 and @xmath112 and a `` valence '' particle with @xmath113 and @xmath114 . the separation energy is denoted by @xmath115 , the q - value of the breakup . </S>",
    "<S> calling the spectroscopic factor of finding the cluster configuration in the ground state of the projectile , @xmath97 one obtains the following expression for the distribution of @xmath116 in the excitation energy @xmath117 @xcite . </S>",
