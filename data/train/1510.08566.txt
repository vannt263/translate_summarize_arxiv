    "the basis of this induction is a rather straightforward observation that all axioms have @xmath11 tricomplexity solutions .",

    "we want to construct an @xmath69 tricomplexity solution @xmath21[xmm2 ] for the conclusion of ( [ r33 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that , while our claim of @xmath21 s being an @xmath69 tricomplexity solution of the conclusion of ( [ r33 ] ) relies on the assumption that we have just made regarding @xmath60 , our _ construction _ of @xmath21 itself does not depend on that assumption .",
    "it should also be noted that we construct @xmath21 as a single - work - tape machine .",
    "this is how @xmath21 works . at the beginning",
    ", it puts the symbol @xmath70 into its buffer .",
    "then it waits till environment specifies constants @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the free variables @xmath73 and @xmath74 of the conclusion of ( [ r33 ] ) . if environment never does so , then @xmath21 is an automatic winner .",
    "otherwise , the game is brought down to @xmath75 .",

    "condition 5 of definition 2.2 of @xcite guarantees that @xmath76 can be remembered with @xmath58 space .",
    "thus , recalling that algo runs in @xmath14 tricomplexity , the steps taken by @xmath21 so far do not take us beyond @xmath14 and hence , in view of remark 2.4 of @xcite , can be ignored in our asymptotic analysis when arguing that @xmath21 runs in @xmath14 tricomplexity .",

    "_ step 2_. if @xmath78 , enter a move state and retire . otherwise , if @xmath79 , simulate the play of the premise of ( [ r33 ] ) by @xmath60 in the scenario where , at the very beginning of the play , @xmath60 s adversary chose the same constants @xmath72 for the variables @xmath74 as environment did in the real play of the conclusion and , additionally , chose @xmath80 for @xmath64 , where @xmath81 . if ( when ) the simulation shows that , at some point , @xmath60 chose the @xmath82-disjunct @xmath83 ( resp .",
    "@xmath85 ) , decrement the value of @xmath76 by @xmath84 , put the bit @xmath42 ( resp .",
    "@xmath84 ) into the buffer , and repeat the present step .",
    "it is not hard to see that , what @xmath21 did while following the above routine was that it constructed , in its buffer , the constant @xmath86 with @xmath87 , and then made @xmath88 as its only move in the play .",
    "this means that @xmath21 is a solution of the conclusion of ( [ r33 ] ) , as desired . and",
    ", of course , our construction of @xmath21 is effective .",
    "it thus remains to see that @xmath21 runs in @xmath89 tricomplexity . in what follows ,",
    "we implicitly rely on remark 2.4 of @xcite , the monotonicity of bounds and the obvious fact that the background of any cycle of the simulated @xmath60 does not exceed the background of ( the cycles of ) @xmath21 throughout its work within .",
    "the latter is the case because all moves that reside on @xmath60 s imaginary run tape  namely , the moves ( containing ) @xmath72  also reside on @xmath21 s run tape .",
    "since @xmath88 is the only move that @xmath21 makes , our earlier observation @xmath90 immediately implies that @xmath21 runs in amplitude @xmath91 , as desired .",
    "next , observe that the space that @xmath21 consumes while performing  is just the space needed to remember the value of the variable @xmath76 , plus the space needed to simulate @xmath60 .",
    "the value of @xmath76 never exceeds @xmath77 , remembering which , as we have already observed , does not take us beyond the target @xmath58 . in order to simulate @xmath60 , on its work tape @xmath21 does not need to keep track of @xmath60 s run tape , because information on that content is available on @xmath21 s own run tape .",
    "so , @xmath21 ( essentially ) only needs to keep track of @xmath60 s work - tape contents . by our assumption",
    ", @xmath60 runs in space @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , keeping track of its work - tape contents takes @xmath92 space , which is again within @xmath58 . to summarize , @xmath21 runs in space @xmath58 , as desired .",
    "finally , taking into account that @xmath60 runs in time @xmath32 and space @xmath31 , it is clear that the time needed for any given iteration of either step of  is @xmath93 .",
    "this is so because simulating each step of @xmath60 takes @xmath92 time , and there are @xmath94 steps to simulate .",
    "altogether , there are @xmath95 iterations of either step 1 or step 2 of .",
    "so , @xmath21 runs in time @xmath96 .",
    "then , in view of the fact that both @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( condition 5 of definition 2.2 of @xcite ) , we find that @xmath21 runs in time @xmath99 for some @xmath100 .",

    "however , sketches do not keep track of what is on @xmath60 s run tape , and that information  unless residing on the run tape of @xmath196 itself by good luck  is generally forgotten .",
    "we handle this difficulty by letting the simulation routine recompute the missing information every time such information is needed .",
    "this is done through recursive calls to the routine itself . properly materializing this general idea",
    "requires quite some care though . among the crucial conditions for our recursive procedure to work within the required space limits",
    "is to make sure that the depth of the recursion stack never exceeds a certain constant bound .    to achieve the above goal",
    ", we let @xmath196 , in addition to the sketches for the simulated steps of @xmath60 , maintain what we call the * global history*.[xglhis ] the latter is a list of all moves made by @xmath60 and its adversary throughout the imaginary play of @xmath1252 `` so far '' .",
    "more precisely , this is not a list of moves themselves , but rather entries with certain partial information on those moves .",
    "namely , the entry for each move @xmath137 does not indicate the actual content of @xmath137 ( which could require more than @xmath58 space ) , but rather only the label of @xmath137 ( @xmath149 or @xmath133 , depending on whether @xmath137 was made by @xmath60 or its adversary ) and the size of @xmath137 , i.e. , the number of symbols in @xmath137 .",
    "recording this information only takes @xmath1267 and hence @xmath1254 space .",
    "further , according to the forthcoming observation ( [ gfjs ] ) , the number of entries in the global history never exceeds @xmath1271 ( in fact @xmath1249 , but why bother ) . since @xmath1249 is a constant",
    ", we find that @xmath196 only consumes an @xmath1254 amount of space for maintaining the overall global history . while a move @xmath137 is not the same as the entry for it in the global history , in the sequel we may terminologically identify these two .",
    "what do we need the global history for ? as noted earlier , during its work , @xmath196 will often have to resimulate some already simulated portions of the work of @xmath191 . to make such a resimulation possible ,",
    "it is necessary to have information on the times at which the adversary of @xmath191 has made its moves in the overall scenario that we are considering and re - constructing .",
    "recording the actual move _ times _ as they were detected during the initial simulation , however , could take us beyond our target space limits .",
    "after all , think of a situation where @xmath60 waits `` very long '' before its environment makes a move .",
    "so , instead , we only keep track  via the global history  of the _ order _ of moves .",
    "then we neutralize the problem of not remembering the `` actual '' times of @xmath191 s adversary s moves by simply assuming that @xmath191 s adversary always makes its moves instantaneously in response to @xmath191 s moves .",
    "the point is that , if @xmath191 wins @xmath1252 , it does so in all scenarios , including the above scenario of instantaneously responding adversary .",
    "it is important to note that , as will be immediately seen from our description of the work of @xmath196 , the moves recorded in the global history at any step of the work of @xmath196 are the same as the moves on the run tape of @xmath191 . and the latter , in turn , are copies of moves on the run tape of @xmath169 , with the only difference that , on @xmath169 s run tape , the @xmath149-labeled moves appear in truncated forms .",
    "the orders of moves in the global history and on the run tape of @xmath60 are exactly the same . as for the run spelled on the run tape of @xmath169 ,",
    "even if truncation did not really modify @xmath60 s moves , it may not necessarily be the same as the run spelled on the run tape of @xmath60 .",
    "instead , the former is only guaranteed to be a @xmath149-delay of the latter ( see section 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , this kind of a difference , just like having the @xmath149-labeled moves truncated , for our purposes ( for @xmath169 s chances to win ) is just as good as  or `` even better than ''  if the two runs were exactly the same .        in the context of a given global history @xmath1272 , this procedure takes the sketch @xmath1273 of a given computation step @xmath80 of @xmath60 , and returns the sketch @xmath1274 of the next computation step @xmath1275 of @xmath60 .",
    "let @xmath859 be the 5th component of @xmath1273 .",
    "the number @xmath859 tells us how many moves @xmath191 had made by time @xmath80 . in most cases ,",
    "update sketch  will be used while re - constructing some past episode of @xmath191 s work .",
    "it is then possible that the global history contains an @xmath1276th move by @xmath191 ( i.e. , with label @xmath149 ) .",
    "if so , then such a move , as well as all subsequent moves of @xmath1272 , are `` future moves '' from the perspective of the @xmath80th step of @xmath191 that update sketch  is currently dealing with .",
    "this means that , when `` imagining '' the situation at the @xmath80th step of @xmath191 , those moves should be discarded .",
    "so , let @xmath1277 be the result of deleting from @xmath1272 the @xmath1276th @xmath149-labeled move and all subsequent , whatever - labeled moves ( if there are no such moves , then simply @xmath1278 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath1277 is exactly a record of the moves that @xmath60 would see  in the same order as they appear in @xmath1277  on its run tape at step @xmath80 .",
    "the information contained in @xmath1273 is `` almost '' sufficient for update sketch  to calculate the sought value of @xmath1274 . the only missing piece of information is the symbol @xmath274 scanned by the run - tape head of @xmath191 on step @xmath80 .",
    "update sketch  thus needs , first of all , to figure out what that symbol @xmath274 is . to do this",

    "once this event is detected , @xmath191 s simulation continues for the scenario where its adversary responded by the move @xmath1317 _ immediately _",
    "after @xmath60 made the move @xmath1311 .",
    "imagine that the final globally new move detected is one by @xmath60 , and such a move is @xmath1318 , signifying choosing the constant @xmath42 for @xmath436 in @xmath1252 .",
    "make history  copies this move in the truncated form  which remains the same @xmath1318 because this move is quasilegal and prudent  in the real play .",
    "then , as always , @xmath1272 is correspondingly updated , and the global simulation is restarted with that updated @xmath1272 .",
    "the last attempt of global simulation ( the one that never got discarded / reconsidered ) corresponds to the `` ultimate '' scenario that determined @xmath196 s real play .",
    "namely , in our present example , the `` ultimate '' scenario in which @xmath191 was simulated is that , at the very beginning of the play , @xmath191 s adversary had made the moves @xmath1309 and @xmath1310 , to which @xmath191 later responded with @xmath1311 , to which @xmath191 s adversary immediately responded with @xmath1317 , to which , some time later , @xmath60 responded with @xmath1318 , and no moves were made ever after . while the imaginary run generated by @xmath60 in this scenario is @xmath1319 the real run generated by @xmath196 is @xmath1320 with ( [ amind2 ] ) being nothing but the result of replacing in ( [ amind1 ] ) all @xmath149-labeled moves by their truncations . since it is our assumption that @xmath60 wins @xmath1252 , ( [ amind1 ] ) is a @xmath149-won run of @xmath1252 .",
    "but then so is ( [ amind2 ] ) because , as noted earlier , truncating a given player s moves can ( increase but ) never decrease that player s chances to win .",
    "why do we need to restart the global simulation every time a globally new move is detected ?",
    "the reason is that otherwise we generally would not be able to rely on calls of fetch symbol  for obtaining required symbols .",
    "going back to our example , imagine we did not restart the global simulation ( make history ) after the moves @xmath1309 and @xmath1305 were made by environment . perhaps ( but not necessarily ) , as before , @xmath60 would still make its move @xmath1311 sometime after @xmath1305 .",
    "fine so far .",
    "but the trouble starts when , after that event , @xmath191 tries to read some symbol of @xmath1311 from its imaginary run tape . a way to provide such",
    "a symbol is to invoke fetch symbol , which will resimulate @xmath60 to find that symbol .",
    "however , in order to properly resimulate @xmath60 up to the moment when it made the move @xmath1311 ( or , at least , put the sought symbol of the latter into its buffer ) , we need to know when ( on which computation steps of @xmath60 ) , exactly , the labmoves @xmath1307 and @xmath1321 emerged on @xmath60 s run tape . unfortunately , we do not remember this piece of information , because , as noted earlier , remembering the exact times ( as opposed to merely remembering the order ) of moves may require more space than we possess .",
    "so , instead , we assume that the moves @xmath1309 and @xmath1322 were made right at the beginning of @xmath60 s play .",
    "this assumption , however , disagrees with the scenario of the original simulation , where @xmath1309 was perhaps only made at step @xmath1323 , and @xmath1322 perhaps at step @xmath1324 .",
    "therefore , there is no guarantee that @xmath60 will still generate the same move @xmath1311 in response to those two moves . restarting the global simulation",
    " as we did  right after @xmath1309 was made , and then restarting it again after @xmath1322 was detected , neutralizes this problem .",
    "if @xmath60 made its move @xmath1311 after @xmath1322 in this new scenario ( the scenario where its imaginary adversary always acted instantaneously ) , then every later resimulation , no matter how many times make history  is restarted , will again take us to the same move @xmath1311 made after @xmath1322 , because the global history , which `` guides '' resimulations , will always be showing the first three labmoves in the order @xmath1325 . to see this , note that all updates of the global history only add some moves to it , and otherwise do not affect the already recorded moves or their order .",
    "we also want to understand one remaining issue .",
    "as we should have noticed , fetch symbol  always calls update sketch , and the latter , in turn , may again call fetch symbol .",
    "where is a guarantee that infinitely many or `` too many '' nested calls will not occur ?",
    "let us again appeal to our present example , and imagine we ( update sketch , that is ) are currently simulating a step of @xmath60 sometime after it already has made the move @xmath1318 . whenever @xmath60 tries to read a symbol of @xmath1326 , fetch symbol  is called to resimulate @xmath191 and find that symbol . while resimulating @xmath191 , however , we may find that , at some point , its run - tape head is trying to read a symbol of the earlier labmove @xmath1327 . to get that symbol ,",
    "fetch symbol  will be again called to resimulate @xmath60 and find that symbol .",
    "can this process of mutual calls go on forever ? not really .",
    "notice that , when fetch symbol  is called to find the sought symbol of @xmath1327 , fetch symbol , guided by the global history , will resimulate @xmath60 only up to the moment when it made the move @xmath1311 . but",
    "during that episode of @xmath60 s work , the labmove @xmath1326 was not yet on its run tape .",
    "so , fetch symbol  will not have to be called further .",
    "generally , as we are going to see in section [ sdfs ] , there can be at most a constant number of nested invocations of fetch symbol  or update sketch .",
    "as seen from the description of make history , the @xmath133-labeled moves recorded in @xmath1272 are the moves made by ( @xmath169 s real ) environment .",
    "since the latter is assumed to play legally , the number of @xmath133-labeled moves in @xmath1272 can not exceed @xmath1249 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath149-labeled moves of @xmath1272 are the moves made by @xmath60 in a certain play . therefore ,",
    "as @xmath60 is a quasilegal solution of @xmath1250 , the number of such moves can not exceed @xmath1249 , either .",
    "thus , with `` never '' below meaning `` at no stage of the work of @xmath169 '' , we have : @xmath1328 since every iteration of make history  increases the number of labmoves in @xmath1272 , an immediate corollary of ( [ gfjs ] ) is that @xmath1329    since make history   is restarted only finitely many times , the last iteration of it never terminates .",
    "let @xmath146 be the sequence of labmoves recorded in the final value of @xmath1272 ( i.e. , the value of @xmath1272 throughout the last iteration of make history ) .",
    "this is the run generated by the simulated @xmath60 in what we referred to as the `` ultimate scenario '' in the preceding subsection ( scenario = computation branch ) .",
    "next , let @xmath157 be the run generated by @xmath169 in the real play that we are considering . since @xmath60 is a solution of @xmath1250",
    ", @xmath146 is a @xmath149-won run of @xmath1250 .",
    "we want to verify that then @xmath157 is also a @xmath149-won run of @xmath1250 , meaning that @xmath169 , too , is a solution of @xmath1250 .    how do @xmath146 and @xmath157 differ from each other ? as noted at the end of section [ sgst ] , an analysis of the work of @xmath169 , details of which are left to the reader , reveals that there are only two differences .",
    "the first difference is that the @xmath149-labeled moves of @xmath146 appear in @xmath157 in truncated forms .",
    "this is so because , whenever @xmath169 makes a move ( according to the prescriptions of stage 3(c ) of make history ) , it copies that move from the 8th component of the sketch of the step of @xmath60 on which the latter made a move @xmath137 ; but the 8th component of a sketch always holds the truncation of the move residing in @xmath60 s buffer ; thus , the move @xmath140 made by @xmath169 in the real play / run @xmath157 is the truncation of the move @xmath137 made by @xmath60 in the imaginary play / run @xmath146 .",
    "the second difference between @xmath146 and @xmath157 is that , even if we ignore the first difference  that is , even if we consider @xmath1202 instead of @xmath146  the run is still not guaranteed to be exactly the same as @xmath157 ; rather , we only know that the latter is a @xmath149-delay of the former .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is that , while performing make history , @xmath169 may notice a move @xmath1330 by environment with some delay , only after it has first noticed a move @xmath1241 by @xmath60 and made the truncation @xmath1331 of @xmath1241 as a move in the real play ; if this happens , @xmath1332 will appear before @xmath1333 in @xmath146 but after @xmath1333 in @xmath157 .",
    "but the game @xmath1250 is static , as are all games studied in col . and , by the very definition of static games ( cf .",
    "section 3 of @xcite ) , @xmath157 s being a @xmath149-delay of @xmath1202 implies that , if @xmath1202 is a @xmath149-won run of @xmath1250 , then so is @xmath157 .",

    "@xmath169 is provident because , as a simple examination shows , it only puts something into its buffer while acting according to clause 3(c ) of the description of make history ; however , at the end of the same clause , we see a prescription for @xmath169 to move , and thus empty the buffer . as for prudence , it is automatically achieved because @xmath169 only makes truncated moves , and such moves are always prudent .",
    "since @xmath169 merely mimics  perhaps in the truncated form and perhaps with some delay  @xmath60 s moves , it is obvious that the amplitude complexity of the former does not exceed that of the latter .",
    "in fact , @xmath169 s running in the target amplitude is also guaranteed by the facts that @xmath1018 ( clause 5 of definition 2.2 of @xcite ) , @xmath1252 is @xmath58-bounded and @xmath196 plays @xmath1252 prudently .",
    "let @xmath1272 be a global history , and @xmath859 a natural number .",

    "similarly , fetch symbol  is always called on a pair @xmath1284 for some numbers @xmath188 and @xmath26 , and we define the * @xmath1272-index * of such a call / run of update sketch  as the @xmath1272-index of @xmath188 ( @xmath26 is thus irrelevant here ) . if @xmath1272 is fixed or clear from the context , we may omit `` @xmath1272- '' and simply say `` * index * '' .      1",
    ".   the index of any run of update sketch   does not exceed @xmath1271 .",
    "whenever a given run of update sketch  calls fetch symbol , the index of the callee is strictly smaller than that of the caller .",
    "3 .   whenever a given run of fetch symbol  calls update sketch",
    ", the index of the callee does not exceed that of the caller .",
    "clause 1 is immediate from the obvious fact that an index can never exceed the number of moves in the global history , and the latter , according to ( [ gfjs ] ) , is bounded by @xmath1271 .",
    "clauses 2 and 3 can be verified through a rather straightforward ( albeit perhaps somewhat long ) analysis of the two procedures update sketch  and fetch symbol ; details of such an analysis are left to the reader .",
    "we are now ready to examine the space complexity of @xmath196 .",
    "the space consumption of @xmath196 comes from the need to simultaneously maintain the global history and various sketches . as observed earlier , maintaining the global history consumes @xmath58 space , and , by lemma [ lsk ] , each sketch also consumes @xmath58 space . at",
    "any given time , the global history is kept in memory in a single copy .",
    "so , to show that the overall space consumption is @xmath58 , we need to show that , at any given time , the number of sketches simultaneously kept in the memory of @xmath196 does not exceed a certain constant . but",
    "this is indeed so .",
    "looking back at the work of make history , we see that , at any time , its top level maintains a single sketch .",
    "it also keeps going through this sketch and updating it through update sketch , one step at a time .",
    "since updates are done sequentially , space used for them can be recycled , so space consumptions for updating different sketches ( this includes not only the top - level sketch of make history , but also many additional sketches that will emerge during calls to fetch symbol  when updating each individual sketch ) do not add together unless those sketches happen to be on a same branch of nested recursive calls that update sketch  and fetch symbol  make to each other . in view of lemma [ mmm ] , however , the depth of recursion ( the height of the recursion stack at any time ) is bounded , because the index of update sketch  in the topmost level of recursion does not exceed @xmath1271 , and every pair of successor levels of recursion strictly decreases the index of the corresponding call of update sketch .      as we observed in ( [ opop ] ) , during the entire work of @xmath196 ,",
    "make history  is iterated at most @xmath1271 times .",
    "the last iteration runs forever , but @xmath196 is not billed for that time because it makes no moves during that period .",
    "likewise , @xmath1410 will not be billed for the time spent on an iteration of make history  that was terminated at stage 2 , because a move by environment resets @xmath169 s time counter to @xmath42 .",
    "call the remaining sorts of iterations of make history   namely , the iterations that terminate according to the scenario of case ( c ) of stage 3  * time - billable*.[xtmbl ] so , it is sufficient for us to understand how much time a single time - billable iteration of make history  takes .",
    "pick any such iteration and fix it throughout the context of the rest of this section , including the forthcoming lemma [ mmmm ] .",
    "we will use @xmath163 to denote the background of the last clock cycle of that iteration .",
    "we verify this lemma by induction on the index @xmath1411 of the corresponding call / run of update sketch  or fetch symbol .",
    "assume @xmath1194 is the index of a given run of update sketch .",
    "looking back at our description of update sketch , we see that this routine makes at most one call of fetch symbol .",
    "first , assume no such call is made .",
    "due to @xmath169 s playing prudently , @xmath1412 is the maximum magnitude of any move that may appear on @xmath169 s run tape at any given time of the iteration .",
    "we also know from lemma [ lagg ] that @xmath1413 .",
    "so , @xmath196 s run - tape size ( by which , as usual , we mean the size of the non - blank segment of the tape ) is @xmath1414 and hence , by the relevant clauses of definition 2.2 of @xcite , is @xmath1256 .",
    "we also know that the sketch and the global history are both of size @xmath1254 and hence @xmath1256 . keeping these facts in mind , with some analysis",
    "it is obvious that , in this case , update sketch   spends @xmath1256 time .",
    "now assume update sketch  _ does _ call fetch symbol . by clause 2 of lemma [ mmm ] , the index @xmath80 of such a call is less than @xmath116 .",
    "hence , by the induction hypothesis , the time taken by the latter is @xmath1256 .",
    "in addition to this , update sketch  only spends the same amount @xmath1256 of time as in the preceding case to complete its work .",
    "thus , in either case , the time consumption of update sketch  is @xmath1256 .",
    "now consider a run of fetch symbol , and let @xmath1194 be its index . by clause 3 of lemma [ mmm ] ,",
    "the index of any call of update sketch  that the given run of fetch symbol   makes is at most @xmath116 . by the induction hypothesis ,",
    "each such call of update sketch  consumes at most @xmath1256 time . processing any such call ( doing additional work related to it ) , in turn",
    ", obviously takes at most @xmath1256 time .",
    "so , each call of update sketch  costs our run of fetch symbol  at most @xmath1256 time .",
    "how many such calls of update sketch  will fetch symbol  make ?",
    "since @xmath60 runs in time @xmath59 , with a little thought one can see that the number of calls of update sketch  is at most @xmath1256 .",
    "so , the overall time cost of the run of fetch symbol  is @xmath1415 , which , in view of the closure of @xmath59 under @xmath1416 , remains @xmath1256 .",
    "stage 2 checks out the run tape , which may require moving the run - tape head of @xmath196 from one end of the ( non - blank segment of the ) run tape to the other end .",
    "additionally , the global history needs to be updated , but this can be done even faster .",
    "so , this stage obviously takes as much time as the size of @xmath169 s run tape , which , as observed in the proof of lemma [ mmmm ] , is @xmath1256 .",
    "stage 3 starts with performing update sketch  ( substage 1 ) , and this , by lemma [ mmmm ] , takes @xmath1256 time . with a little thought , the time taken by substages ( b ) and ( c ) of stage 3 can be seen to be at most quadratic in the size of @xmath169 s run tape .",
    "we know that the latter is @xmath1254 .",
    "hence so is @xmath1417 , because @xmath59 is closed under @xmath1416 .",
    "to summarize , none of the @xmath1294 stages of make history  takes more than @xmath1256 time .",
    "stage 1 is repeated only once , and the remaining two stages are repeated at most @xmath1256 times as can be seen with a little thought , keeping in mind that the iteration of make history  that we are dealing with is a time - billable one .",
    "if so , due to @xmath59 s closure under @xmath1416 , the overall time consumption is @xmath1256 , which obviously implies that @xmath169 plays @xmath1250 in time @xmath59 , as desired ."
