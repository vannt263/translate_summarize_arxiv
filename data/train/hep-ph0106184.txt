    "spin transfer in high - energy hadronization process of the fragmenting quark to the produced hadron is one of the important issues in the spin effects in hadronization processes .",
    "the problem has attracted much attention [ [ att]-[ma0002 ] ] recently .",
    "this is partly triggered by the aleph and opal measurements@xcite on @xmath3 polarization in @xmath4 annihilation at the @xmath5 pole .",
    "compared with the theoretical calculations@xcite , those data@xcite seem to suggest that the simple su(6 ) wave - function can be used to describe the relation between the spin of the fragmenting quark and that of the produced hyperon which contains the fragmenting quark .",
    "this is rather surprising because the energy is very high at cern @xmath4 collider lep and the initial quarks and antiquarks produced at the annihilation vertices of the initial @xmath4 are certainly current quarks and current antiquarks rather than the constituent quarks used in describing the static properties of hadrons using su(6 ) symmetric wave - functions .",
    "a conclusive judgment of the different spin transfer models can still not be made .",
    "it is thus interesting and instructive to make further checks in experiments by making complementary measurements .",
    "for this purpose , we have made a systematic study of hyperon polarizations in different lepton - induced reactions using the su(6 ) or the dis picture .",
    "the results for @xmath4 annihilation have been presented in ref .",
    "[ [ ll2000 ] ] .",
    "we now present the results for other lepton - induced reactions , such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    compared with those in @xmath4 annihilations , hyperon polarizations in the current fragmentation regions of the deeply inelastic lepton - nucleon scatterings @xmath0 and @xmath1 at high energy are of particular interests for the following reasons : first , not only longitudinally but also transversely polarized quark beam can be produced in the current fragmentation regions of @xmath0 .",
    "we can study here not only longitudinal transfer but also check whether it is the same for the transverse polarization case .",
    "second , there is an automatic flavor separation in some cases in the deeply inelastic lepton - nucleon scatterings .",
    "for example , in the current fragmentation region of @xmath1 , we have a predominant contribution from the @xmath6 quark fragmentation . in @xmath7",
    ", we have a combined contribution from the @xmath6 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9-quarks with the corresponding weights @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the bjorken-@xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the number density of quark in proton . since the @xmath13 dependences of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are different from each other , we can tune the contributions of different flavors by choosing events in different @xmath13-region . since different flavors contribute quite differently to the polarizations of different hyperons , we expect that the results obtained in different kinematic regions should be quite different from each other and they should also be different from those obtained in @xmath4 annihilations@xcite .",
    "measurements of these polarizations with high accuracy should provide us with detailed tests of different aspects of different models .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : in sec .",
    "2 , we briefly summarize the calculation method of the hyperon polarization , which was outlined in ref . [ [ ll2000 ] ] using @xmath18 as an example , and discuss the differences in different reactions . in sec . 3",
    ", we present the results for the hyperon polarizations in the current fragmentation regions of the deeply inelastic scatterings off nucleon with @xmath19 or @xmath20 beam . in sec . 4",
    ", we present our results for the hyperon polarization in the current fragmentation region of @xmath1 .",
    "a brief summary of the results is given in sec .",
    "the method of calculating the longitudinal polarization @xmath21 of different hyperon @xmath22 in the fragmentation of a longitudinally polarized quark @xmath23 has been outlined in ref . [ [ ll2000 ] ] using the inclusive process @xmath24 as an example .",
    "the method is independent of the way how @xmath25 is produced thus can certainly be applied to other processes where the longitudinally polarized fragmenting quarks are produced .",
    "similarly , it can also be applied to processes where transversely polarized quarks are produced .",
    "we now briefly summarize the main points and discuss the differences in different reactions in the following .",
    "we recall that , to calculate the polarization of hyperon @xmath22 s which are produced in the fragmentation of a polarized quark @xmath23 , we should consider the @xmath22 s which have the following different origins separately .",
    "\\(a ) hyperons which are directly produced and contain the fragmenting quark @xmath23 ;    \\(b ) hyperons which are decay products of other heavier hyperons which were polarized before their decay ;    \\(c ) hyperons which are directly produced but do not contain the fragmenting quark @xmath23 ;    \\(d ) hyperons which are decay products of other heavier hyperons which were unpolarized before their decay .",
    "it is clear that hyperons from ( a ) and ( b ) can be polarized while those from ( c ) and ( d ) are not @xcite . hence , the polarization of @xmath22 is given by @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is the polarization of the fragmenting quark @xmath23 ; @xmath28 is the average number of the hyperons which are directly produced and contain the fragmenting quark of flavor @xmath29 ; @xmath30 is the average number of @xmath22 coming from the decay of @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the polarization of @xmath31 before its decay ; @xmath33 ) , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are average numbers of hyperons in group ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) , respectively ; @xmath37 is the  fragmentation polarization transfer factor \" from quark @xmath23 to hyperon @xmath22 , where the superscript @xmath38 stands for fragmentation ; @xmath39 is the  decay polarization transfer factor \" from @xmath31 to @xmath22 in the decay process @xmath40 , where the superscript @xmath41 stands for decay .",
    "we recall that the fragmentation polarization transfer factor @xmath37 is equal to the fraction of spin carried by the @xmath29-flavor - quark divided by the average number of quark of flavor @xmath29 in the hyperon @xmath22@xcite .",
    "it is different in the su(6 ) or the dis picture .",
    "the decay polarization transfer factor @xmath39 is determined by the decay process .",
    "clearly , both of them are universal in the sense that they are independent of the processes in which @xmath23 and @xmath31 are produced .",
    "they are the same in @xmath4 annihilations and in the deeply inelastic scattering with longitudinally polarized beam and/or target and in that with neutrino beam .",
    "these two factors are discussed in detail in ref .",
    "[ [ ll2000 ] ] .",
    "they can be found , e.g. , in table i and table ii in ref .",
    "[ [ ll2000 ] ] , respectively .",
    "the differences for different processes come from the polarization @xmath27 of the fragmenting quark @xmath23 and the average numbers @xmath28 , @xmath30 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 for hyperon @xmath22 of the different origins .",
    "since the leading order hard subprocesses of these lepton - induced reactions involve only electro - weak interactions , the polarization @xmath27 of the fragmenting quark @xmath25 produced in these reactions can easily be calculated using the standard model of electro - weak interactions .",
    "they are in general different for @xmath4 annihilation and for deeply inelastic lepton - nucleon scatterings .",
    "they are also different in different kinematic regions in deep - inelastic scattering or for different flavors of the struck quarks .",
    "since different flavors contribute quite differently to the polarizations of different hyperons , this makes the situation full of abundance and interesting .",
    "we will discuss them separately in next sections .    in the fragmentation process of a given flavor of quark @xmath25 at a given energy , the average numbers @xmath28 , @xmath30 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 should also be independent of the process in which @xmath25 is produced .",
    "they are determined by the hadronization mechanism and should be independent of the polarization of @xmath25 .",
    "but , for different reactions , the relative weights of the contributions of different flavors are different .",
    "hence the resulting @xmath28 , @xmath30 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are also different in different reactions . for deeply inelastic lepton - nucleon scatterings ,",
    "the relative weights are determined by the number densities of different flavors in the nucleon .",
    "this implies that the average numbers @xmath28 , @xmath30 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are determined by the hadronization mechanism and the structure functions of the nucleon .",
    "we emphasize here that , although neither the structure function nor the hadronization mechanism is theoretically clear yet , the form of the unpolarized parton densities in nucleon and that of the unpolarized fragmentation functions are empirically known to reasonably high accuracy . we can calculate them using the parameterizations of the structure functions and the phenomenological hadronization models . since we are not concerned with the different correlations among the produced particles , different hadronization models",
    "lead essentially to the same results .",
    "presently , these results can be obtained conveniently from the event generators using monte carlo method .",
    "we used the lund string fragmentation model@xcite implemented by lepto@xcite in our calculations for deeply inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering .",
    "for sufficiently high @xmath42 and high total hadronic energy @xmath43 , hadrons produced in the current fragmentation region in deeply inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering can be considered as a pure result of the fragmentation of the single struck quark .",
    "( here , @xmath42 is the virtuality of the exchanged boson in the initial electro - weak interaction ; @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the nucleon mass ) .",
    "hence , they can be used to study the spin effects in high - energy fragmentation processes , in particular the spin transfer from the polarized fragmenting quark to the produced hadrons .",
    "we will limit ourselves to such kinematic regions in this paper and will not discuss the cases at lower energies@xcite where no distinct separation between the fragmentation results of the struck quark and that of the rest of the target nucleon is possible@xcite .",
    "we will discuss both the case where the virtual photon exchange dominates and the case where charged weak current interaction takes place . in this section",
    ", we will discuss the first case using @xmath0 as an example .",
    "the latter case will be discussed in sec .",
    "4 .    in the deeply inelastic scattering @xmath0 ,",
    "the leading order hard subprocess @xmath46 is an electro - magnetic process in which a single virtual photon exchange dominates . in such subprocess , if the initial @xmath19 or @xmath47 is polarized or both of them are polarized , the outgoing quark can be polarized .",
    "obviously , the polarization of the outgoing quark is dependent on the polarization of the initial @xmath19 , that of @xmath47 , and the scattering process .",
    "there should be a factor relating the polarization of the outgoing quark with that of the initial quark or @xmath19 .",
    "this factor is usually referred as the depolarization factor . in the following",
    ", we will first briefly summarize the depolarization factor for the elementary subprocess @xmath46 , and then present the results that we obtained for hyperon polarization in the current fragmentation region of @xmath0 using different pictures for spin transfer in the fragmentation process .",
    "we will also briefly discuss how to tune the contributions of different flavors by choosing different @xmath13 region .",
    "the calculation of the polarization of the outgoing quark from @xmath46 is straightforward and the results can be found in different publications . for completeness , we briefly summarize the main ingredients used in the calculations and the main results which will be used in our calculations of hyperon polarization and discuss the behaviors of these results in different cases in this subsection .",
    "we recall that the polarization of a particle system is described by the spin density matrix @xmath48 . for the system of the incoming @xmath19 and @xmath47 , which are independent of each other , @xmath48 is a direct product of that of @xmath47 and that of @xmath19 , which we denote by @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively .",
    "the @xmath49 and @xmath50 are @xmath51 matrices , which is taken as the form @xmath52 ; where @xmath53 is the pauli matrix and @xmath54 is the polarization vector of @xmath55 or @xmath56 ) .",
    "if we know the scattering matrix @xmath45 of the process , we can calculate the spin density matrix @xmath57 for the outgoing system from the @xmath58 for the initial system using the relation @xmath59 , or in helicity bases @xmath60 where we use @xmath61 and @xmath62 to denote the helicities of @xmath19 and @xmath47 respectively , and the prime to denote final state ; @xmath63 is the usual helicity amplitude for the scattering process @xmath46 .",
    "we neglect the @xmath19 and @xmath47 mass , so that helicity is conserved , i.e. , @xmath64 only if @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "furthermore , parity conservation requires @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "hence , there are only two nonzero independent @xmath63 s , and they are @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the scattering angle in the @xmath72 center of mass frame .",
    "we insert these @xmath63 s into eq .",
    "( [ sub1eq1 ] ) , sum over the helicity of the outgoing @xmath19 , and we obtain the spin density matrix for the outgoing quark as @xmath73 here @xmath74 ; @xmath75 ; @xmath76 ; where @xmath77 means the component parallel to the moving direction ; @xmath78 , where @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 are the four momenta of the incoming @xmath47 , @xmath19 , and the outgoing @xmath19 respectively ; and @xmath82/[1+(1-y)^2 ] ; \\label{sub1eq4}\\ ] ] @xmath83 .",

    "( [ sub1eq1])-([sub1eq2 ] ) , we have dropped a common factor @xmath84/y^2 $ ] , which has no influence on the results of the polarization of the outgoing quark .    from these results",
    ", we can calculate the polarization of the outgoing @xmath47 in different cases .",
    "we first discuss the case in which the initial quark is not transversely polarized , i.e. , @xmath85 . in this case , we have @xmath86 .",
    "this means that , independent of the polarization of the incoming lepton @xmath19 , the outgoing quark is not transversely polarized .",
    "but , from eq .",
    "( [ sub1eq3 ] ) , we see also that , in this case , the outgoing quark can be longitudinally polarized and the polarization is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the longitudinal polarization of the incoming quark .",
    "we see clearly that , not only the longitudinal polarization of the incoming @xmath47 but also the longitudinal polarization of the incoming @xmath19 can be transfered to the outgoing @xmath47 . furthermore , from eq .",
    "( [ sub1eq6 ] ) , we see that , @xmath89 which shows that the longitudinal polarization of the quark will be completely transferred to the outgoing quark , which is just the result of helicity conservation .",
    "we also see from eq .",
    "( [ sub1eq6 ] ) that , @xmath90 it shows that , for the scattering of a longitudinally polarized lepton on unpolarized nucleon target , the polarization of the incoming lepton can also be transferred to the outgoing quark with a reduction factor @xmath91 .",
    "hence , @xmath91 is usually referred to as the longitudinal depolarization factor .",
    "it is interesting to see that @xmath91 is only a function of @xmath92 .",
    "its @xmath92 dependence is shown by the solid line in fig.1 .",
    "we see that @xmath93 for @xmath94 , it increases with the increasing @xmath92 and @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "we recall that , for given energy and @xmath42 , @xmath97 .",
    "this implies that the depolarization factor @xmath98 is large for small @xmath13 but small for large @xmath13 .",
    "we denote the longitudinal polarization of the incoming nucleon by @xmath99 . at a given bjorken-@xmath13 , for quark of flavor @xmath29 , @xmath100 ; where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the unpolarized and longitudinally polarized distribution functions of quark of flavor @xmath29 inside the nucleon .",
    "hence , we obtain the polarization of the outgoing quark of flavor @xmath29 as @xmath103 this is the general formula which can be used to replace the @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) to calculate @xmath104 .",

    "now , we discuss the second case , in which the incoming quark is transversely polarized . in this case , we have @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "this means that the outgoing quark is transversely polarized .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath113 is a real number , the direction of the transverse polarization with respect to the helicity frame remains the same .",
    "the magnitude of the transverse polarization of the outgoing quark is given by @xmath114 which is independent of the polarization of the incoming lepton @xmath19 .",
    "the function @xmath115 , which is given by eq .",
    "( [ sub1eq5 ] ) , is called transverse depolarization factor .",
    "it depends also only on @xmath92 and its @xmath92 dependence is given by the dashed line in fig.1 .",
    "we see that , in contrast to @xmath91 , @xmath115 decreases with the increasing @xmath92 and @xmath116 , @xmath117 .",

    "hence , the polarization of the outgoing quark of flavor @xmath29 is given by @xmath121 this should be used to replace the @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) to calculate the hyperon polarization in transversely polarized case .      having the @xmath27 s obtained in the last subsection",
    ", we can calculate @xmath104 using eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) if we know the average numbers @xmath28 , @xmath30 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "we will present the results in different cases in this subsection .      among all the @xmath124 hyperons , @xmath3 is most copiously produced , and it can also be measured easily through the decay channel @xmath125 .",
    "hence , till now , most of the studies [ [ att]-[opal98],[nomad]-[e665 ] ] are concentrated on @xmath3 polarization .",
    "however , as can be seen already in @xmath4 annihilation@xcite , the origins of @xmath3 are also most complicated .",
    "they come not only from the fragmentation of @xmath6 , @xmath8 , or @xmath9-quark , but also from the decays of many different heavier hyperons , such as , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 .",
    "compared with @xmath4 annihilation , in @xmath123 the contribution from @xmath6-quark fragmentation is much higher in particular for large @xmath13 .",
    "since @xmath6 carries no spin of @xmath3 in the su(6 ) picture and only a small fraction of the spin of @xmath3 in the dis picture , we expect that the magnitudes of the @xmath130 obtained in both models for @xmath123 should be smaller than those obtained in @xmath4 annihilation , in particular for large @xmath13 .",
    "we expect also that the influences of heavier hyperon decay are larger .",
    "using the event generator lepto , we obtained the @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 for @xmath135 .",
    "in fig.3 , we show the different contributions in the current fragmentation region at @xmath136gev .",
    "these results are obtained for the kinematic region @xmath137(gev",
    "/ c)@xmath108 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 .",
    "we choose this kinematic region to ensure a reasonably large @xmath43 and a reasonably high polarization of the fragmenting quark .",
    "we see that the contributions from the @xmath9 quark fragmentation are indeed not so dominant as that@xcite in @xmath140 .",
    "we also see that in contrast to @xmath9-quark fragmentation , the contributions from the decay of heavier hyperons in the case of @xmath6 or @xmath8 quark fragmentation can even be larger than those directly produced .    using these results",
    ", we obtained @xmath130 in @xmath135 , as a function of @xmath141 shown in fig.4 for different combinations of @xmath106 and @xmath99 .",
    "we see that except for the case of @xmath142 and @xmath143 , @xmath130 are positive and increases with increasing @xmath141 .",
    "their magnitudes are significantly large , and that they are different in the su(6 ) or the dis picture in large @xmath141 region .",
    "we also see that for @xmath142 and @xmath143 , @xmath130 is negative but the magnitude is very small .",
    "this is because in this case the polarizations of the fragmenting quarks are very small and it is positive for @xmath6 , but is negative for @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "their contributions to @xmath3 polarization partly cancel with each other .",
    "hence , we see that , to obtain a large longitudinal polarization of @xmath3 , it is important to use a polarized @xmath19 beam .    to show the @xmath13 dependence of @xmath130 , we calculated also the results in the large @xmath13 region ( @xmath144 ) only .",
    "the obtained results are also given in fig.4 .",
    "we see that they are significantly smaller than those in the region @xmath138 .",
    "this is because for large @xmath13 the @xmath6 quarks play the dominant role and the contribution from @xmath6 to @xmath3 polarization is small .",
    "now we discuss the transversely polarized case .",
    "we calculate the @xmath3 polarization under the assumption that the same spin transfer mechanism is true both for longitudinally and transversely polarized cases .",
    "hence , eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) is also true for transversely polarized case , but the spin transfer factor @xmath37 can in general be different .",
    "they are determined by the spin structure of hyperon in transversely polarized case .",
    "more precisely , in the su(6 ) picture , @xmath37 is the same for transversely and longitudinally polarized cases . but , in the dis picture , they are determined by the helicity distribution @xmath102 in the longitudinally polarized case , but by the transversity distribution @xmath120 in the transversely polarized case .",
    "since @xmath120 can in general be different from @xmath102 , the @xmath37 in the two cases can be different from each other .",
    "presently , the spin structure in dis picture in transversely polarized case is still very unclear , since no measurement has been done for @xmath120 yet . in order to see the order of magnitude of the polarization which we can expect for different hyperon in transversely polarized case",
    ", we made a very rough estimation by using the same @xmath37 as those in longitudinally polarized case and @xmath145 in calculating @xmath146 from eq .",
    "( [ sub1eq11 ] ) . under those approximations ,",
    "the differences between the @xmath3 polarization in this case and that in the longitudinally polarized case of @xmath147 come only from the differences between @xmath115 and @xmath91 .",
    "we recall that @xmath115 is larger for smaller @xmath92 ( see fig.1 ) , so we choose to study in the region @xmath148 , in order to obtain a relatively large transverse polarization of the fragmenting quark .",
    "we also select the two groups of events in the kinematic region @xmath138 and @xmath137 ( gev / c)@xmath108 , and @xmath144 and @xmath137 ( gev / c)@xmath108 , respectively . using the eqs .",
    "( [ sub1eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq1 ] ) , we obtained @xmath149 in @xmath150 , as a function of @xmath141 shown in fig.5a .",
    "we see that @xmath149 is negative but its magnitude is relatively small ( of the order of 0.02 ) .",
    "we note that longitudinal @xmath3 polarization has been measured @xcite by hermes collaboration at hera in @xmath151 at 27.5 gev / c .",
    "however , we can not compare our results shown in fig.4 with he hermes data , since the energy in that experiment is rather low . at that energy , no separation between the fragmentation of the struck quark and that of the rest of the target proton is possible . a detailed discussion of this problem is given in ref . [ [ lnl ] ] .      from the results that we obtained in the last subsection",
    ", we see that , because of the large contributions from @xmath6 and @xmath8 quark fragmentation in @xmath135 , the contributions from the decay of heavier hyperons are large and the @xmath3 polarization in transversely polarized case is very small .",
    "since the contributions of different flavors to the spins of the @xmath153 hyperons are unknown yet in the dis picture and only models are known to calculate the spin transfer in their decay processes , there are considerably large theoretical uncertainties in the results that we can obtain yet . on the other hand ,",
    "as we have already seen @xcite in studying @xmath154 , the origins of other @xmath155 hyperons , i.e. , @xmath156 and @xmath157 , are rather clear .",
    "the decay contributions are much smaller than the corresponding contributions for @xmath3 production .",
    "hence , the uncertainties in the theoretical calculation in this case can be significantly reduced .",
    "we thus continue to study the polarization of these @xmath155 hyperons in @xmath122 in the following .",
    "we note in particular that , in current fragmentation region of @xmath158 , @xmath6-quark fragmentation plays the dominant role .",
    "since the fractional contribution of @xmath6 quark to the spin of @xmath2 is large , the resulting @xmath2 polarization in the current fragmentation region of @xmath159 should be significantly larger than that for @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , also because of the large contribution of @xmath6-quark fragmentation , the ratio of the production rate of @xmath2 to that of @xmath3 in the current fragmentation region of @xmath152 should be significantly higher than from that in @xmath4 annihilation@xcite , in particular for large @xmath141 where hyperon polarization should be studied .",
    "this can easily be checked using the event generator lepto . in fig.6a",
    ", we show the ratios of the production rate of @xmath2 to that of @xmath3 as function of @xmath141 .",
    "we see that the ratio increases with increasing @xmath141 , and is already very close to 1 at @xmath160 .",
    "therefore , the statistics in studying @xmath2 should not be much worse than that for @xmath3 .",

    "hence , the uncertainties in the calculations for @xmath2 are much smaller than those for @xmath3 and the study of @xmath2 polarization should provide us with a good complementary test to different spin transfer pictures .    using the event generator lepto , we calculated the different average numbers @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and @xmath165",

    "we see also that the difference between the results based on the two different pictures are also larger compared with those for @xmath3 and these properties are more significant for the events with @xmath144 .",

    "it increases with increasing @xmath141 , and the results obtained in the different pictures are significantly different from each other in particular at @xmath144 .",
    "we see also that @xmath168 at @xmath144 is larger compared with that at @xmath138 .",
    "hence , we expect that the measurement of @xmath168 should provide useful information on the transverse polarization transfer in high - energy fragmentation processes .    at the same time , we also make similar calculations for other octet hyperons , i.e. , @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "the obtained results are shown in figs.8 , 9 and 10 .",
    "we also performed the same calculations for reactions using neutron target . because of the difference caused by the charge factor in the electromagnetic interactions which make the @xmath6 ( or @xmath8 ) contributions in the case of the neutron target be higher ( lower ) than that of @xmath8 ( or @xmath6 ) in the case of proton target , there is no exact @xmath6-@xmath8 exchange symmetry in the results obtained in the two cases .",
    "we can not obtain the results for hyperon in the case of neutron from those in the case of proton by making an interchange of @xmath6 and @xmath8 .",
    "but the qualitative features can be obtained in this way .",
    "hence , we expect that measuring @xmath170 polarization in @xmath173 can give us useful information for spin transfer in fragmentation process .",
    "compared with @xmath4 annihilation and @xmath175 deeply inelastic scattering , the deep - inelastic scattering process @xmath176 has the following two distinct advantages .",
    "first , the magnitude of the polarization of the fragmenting quark is large . in @xmath176 ,",
    "the leading order hard subprocess is @xmath177 , which is a charged current weak interaction with the exchange of the virtual @xmath178 .",
    "according to the standard model for weak interaction , the charged current weak interaction selects only left - handed quarks ( right - handed antiquark ) , so the polarization of the fragmenting quarks is @xmath179 .",
    "second , there is an automatic flavor separation . for sufficiently high @xmath42 and high total hadronic energy @xmath43 ,",
    "the dominant contributions in the current fragmentation region of @xmath1 come from the fragmentation of the fully polarized @xmath6 quarks .",
    "thus , measuring the polarization of the hyperon in this reaction should be able to provide us with a very sensitive test to different models for the spin transfer in the fragmentation process .    with the aid of lepto event generator , we calculated @xmath3 and @xmath2 longitudinal polarizations in the current fragmentation region of @xmath180 at @xmath181 gev and @xmath182(gev / c)@xmath108 .",
    "we find out that , the contributions from the decay of different heavier hyperons to @xmath3 are very large .",
    "this can be seen in fig.11 .",
    "we see that the decay contribution are even larger than those directly produced .",
    "we see also that there are significant contributions from the decay of @xmath183 and other charm - baryons . in particular in the region of @xmath184 , they are larger than the contributions from the other origins .",
    "since the decay spin transfer factor @xmath39 is model dependent and the polarizations of these heavier hyperons are unclear , these results imply that there are large theoretical uncertainties in calculating @xmath130 , in particular from the treatment of @xmath183 and other charm baryon decays .",
    "we thus made a very rough estimation for @xmath130 using the @xmath185 given in table ii in ref .",
    "[ [ ll2000 ] ] as input . for @xmath183",
    ", we simply take the fragmentation polarization transfer from the @xmath186 quark to @xmath187 is @xmath188 , and the decay polarization transfer factor for @xmath189 is also taken as 1 , i.e. , @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "the obtained results are shown in fig.12a . to show the influence of @xmath187 decay , we show also the results obtained by taking @xmath192 .",
    "we see that , in the case of @xmath192 , @xmath3 polarization @xmath130 is very small .",
    "this is because the contributions from the decay of @xmath193 and @xmath194 to @xmath3 polarization are negative but other contributions are positive , and they partly cancel with each other .",
    "we see also that @xmath130 decreases with increasing @xmath141 at @xmath195 and increases with increasing @xmath141 at @xmath196 .",
    "this is because the contributions from the decay of @xmath193 and @xmath194 are dominant at @xmath195 and decrease at @xmath196 .",
    "these results obtained in the case of @xmath191 differs largely from those in the case of @xmath192 . in this case @xmath130",
    "is still negative , but the magnitude of @xmath130 is much larger than that in the case of @xmath192 .",
    "the decrease with increasing @xmath141 at @xmath184 and the increase with increasing @xmath141 at @xmath197 is due to the contributions from @xmath187 decay are dominant at @xmath184 and decrease at @xmath197 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath3 , from fig.12b and 12d , we see that the contributions from the decay of heavier strange hyperons and charm - baryons to @xmath2 are very small .",
    "the contributions from the decay of @xmath193 containing the fragmenting @xmath6 quark only take about @xmath198 , and that those from the decay of @xmath183 and other charm - baryons take only about @xmath199 .",
    "therefore the theoretical uncertainties in calculating @xmath2 polarization are small . furthermore , because of the dominance of the @xmath6 quark fragmentation , we expected that the @xmath2 production rate should be relatively high .",
    "this can easily be seen in fig.12 or fig .",
    "13 where we show the ratio of the production rate of @xmath3 to that of @xmath2 .",
    "the result shows that the ratio increases with the increasing @xmath141 , and reaches about 1.6 at @xmath160 .",
    "hence , the statistics for @xmath2 is not less than that for @xmath3 in the current fragmentation region of @xmath200 .    inserting these results into eq.([eq1 ] )",
    "we obtain the @xmath2 polarization shown in fig.12b , where the contributions from the decay of charm - baryons are not taken into account .",
    "we see that @xmath2 polarization is negative and its magnitude is very large and increases with increasing @xmath141 , and the difference between the results based on the two different pictures is quite significant .",
    "hence measuring @xmath166 in the current fragmentation region of @xmath201 should be very validity to distinguish the different pictures for spin transfer in high - energy fragmentation processes .",
    "we calculated the polarizations for different octet hyperons produced in the current fragmentation regions of the deeply inelastic lepton - nucleon scatterings @xmath0 and @xmath1 for sufficiently large @xmath42 and @xmath202 using different models for spin transfer in high - energy fragmentation processes .",
    "we discussed in detail the contributions from different sources including those from the decay of different heavier hyperons .",
    "our results show that measurements of these hyperon polarizations should provide useful information to distinguish between different models in particular the su(6 ) and the dis pictures used frequently in the literature .",
    "we found in particular that decay contributions to @xmath3 are very important in @xmath123 and @xmath203 and have to be taken into account in calculating the @xmath3 polarizations in these reactions .",
    "we found also that measuring the polarizations of @xmath2 in @xmath204 or @xmath205 can give a much better test to the validity of the different models than that obtained by measuring @xmath3 in the corresponding processes not only because the magnitudes of @xmath206 and the differences between different models are much larger than that of @xmath207 but also because the theoretical uncertainties are much smaller in calculating the former .",
    "measuring @xmath168 in transversely polarized case should be able to give an useful check whether in high - energy fragmentation process the polarization transfer mechanisms are the same for both the longitudinally polarized and transversely polarized cases .",
