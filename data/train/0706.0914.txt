    "the earliest observed epoch of the universe is 380000 years after the big bang when protons and electrons combined into neutral hydrogen .",
    "the radiation from this epoch , observed as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , shows that the universe was homogeneous with fractional density fluctuations of only @xmath7 . for the following few hundred million years there were no stars or galaxies .",
    "this period is often referred to as the dark ages because of the absence of sources of light ( rees 1999 ) .",
    "eventually these small density fluctuations in the dark matter distribution grew into dark matter halos where gas could cool and form galaxies .",
    "as stars and black holes formed within galaxies they emitted copious amounts of ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation .",
    "many of these photons escaped their host galaxies and ionized hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "when sufficient sources of ionizing photons had formed , they provided an ionizing background radiation field high enough to ionize all the diffuse neutral hydrogen in the igm .",
    "the details of reionization are sensitive to the luminosity function of ionizing sources , the fraction of ionizing photons that escape from them , the ionizing source spectra and the clumpiness of the igm ( miralda - escud et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "quasars are useful probes of reionization because they can be detected at very high redshift and have strong intrinsic uv radiation that is absorbed at the resonant lyman lines by neutral hydrogen .",
    "the presence of significant flux in the ly@xmath8  forest of quasars at @xmath9 indicates that the igm is almost completely reionized by this epoch ( fan et al .",

    "the discovery of gunn - petersen troughs in the spectra of quasars at @xmath10 have been interpreted as evidence that we are approaching the epoch of reionization ( becker et al .",

    ". fan et al .",
    "( 2006b ) analyzed a sample of 19 sdss quasars at @xmath11 and found that the mean gunn - peterson optical depth and its variance increase sharply away from the low redshift extrapolation at @xmath11 , consistent with the overlap phase of reionization occurring at @xmath12 ( gnedin & fan 2006 ) .",
    "however , it has also been argued that these data are compatible with much earlier reionization ( songaila 2004 ; becker et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the sizes of highly - ionized near - zones around quasars are sensitive to the neutral fraction of hydrogen before the quasar turned on ( cen & haiman 2000 ) .",
    "however , the interpretation of these results is complex and various authors have come to a wide range of conclusions on the basis of the same sdss quasar spectra ( wyithe & loeb 2004 ; wyithe , et al . 2005 ; yu & lu 2005 ; fan et al . 2006b ; bolton & haehnelt 2007a , b ; mesinger & haiman 2007 ; alvarez & abel 2007 ) .",
    "despite these uncertainties , this could be a powerful probe at high neutral fractions where traditional gunn - peterson measurements are insensitive .",
    "becker et al . ( 2006 ) studied oi  absorption up to @xmath13 and did not find an oi  forest suggesting that these lines of sight are either largely unenriched or significantly ionized .",
    "simulations predict that reionization is an inhomogeneous process due to the existence of discrete , clustered ionizing sources and an inhomogeneous igm ( e.g. barkana & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "cosmic variance in transmission due to large - scale density inhomogeneities is extremely large on proper scales up to 20mpc at @xmath14 and rapidly increases at earlier times before full reionization ( wyithe & loeb 2006 ) .",
    "the sdss presently contains only a handful of quasars at a high enough redshift ( @xmath15 ) to probe a large path length of the @xmath16 igm . from fan et al .",
    "( 2006a ) and refs therein , the path length at @xmath17 presently probed by the sdss quasars is only @xmath18 proper mpc ( excluding the broad absorption line quasar sdssj1048 + 4607 , whose broad absorption lines may be confused with igm absorption ) .",
    "observations of sdss quasars at @xmath19 show evidence for significant cosmic variance with a substantial range of foreground igm absorption ( oh & furlanetto 2005 ) . more quasars are required to overcome cosmic variance at @xmath6",

    "the survey plans to cover @xmath25 square degrees in 4 optical filters @xmath26 to a limiting depth of @xmath27 .",
    "this is more than 2 magnitudes fainter than the sdss survey leading to the discovery of correspondingly lower luminosity quasars .",

    "the four quasars whose discovery we report here were found in the first two years of optical imaging of the cfhqs . the total area covered at this time is @xmath33 square degrees to typical limits of @xmath34 .",
    "however , because follow - up observations are not complete , we expect this region to contain more quasars than discovered so far and no conclusions on the space density of low luminosity quasars and shape of the luminosity function at @xmath35 are available at this time .",
    "we only briefly describe the processing and photometry of the imaging observations in this paper .",
    "a much fuller description is given in delorme et al .",
    "pre - processing of the megacam images is carried out at cfht using the elixir pipeline .",
    "this removes the instrumental effects from the images .",
    "we then run our own algorithms to improve the astrometry and check the photometry .",
    "finally , we stack the images ( for those cases where there is more than one exposure at a given position ) and register the images in the four different filters .",
    "photometry is carried out using our own adaption of sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) which uses dual image multiple psf - fitting ( delorme & bertin in prep . ) to optimize the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of point sources .",
    "candidate quasars are initially identified on the optical images as objects which have very high @xmath36 colors . in willott",
    "et al . ( 2005a ) we described in detail our method for identifying high-@xmath0 quasars and brown dwarfs using megacam optical plus near - ir imaging .",
    "as shown in that paper , photometric noise cause many m stars ( with intrinsic colors of @xmath37 ) to be scattered into the region of the diagram at @xmath38 where we would expect to find only l or t dwarfs and quasars .",
    "the huge number of these m stars would require a lot of telescope time for complete follow - up .",
    "therefore we now limit our survey to objects observed to be redder than @xmath39 , with stronger priority for follow - up given to redder objects . in willott",
    "et al . ( 2005a ) , we showed that changing the criterion from @xmath40 to @xmath41 only loses us quasars at @xmath42 , but reduces the number of m dwarf contaminants by @xmath43% .",
    "similarly , imposing a cut at @xmath44 or even @xmath45 would have very little effect on the number of @xmath6 quasars discovered .",

    "quasar spectra are divided by their intrinsic spectra as defined in sec.[intrinsic ] to determine the transmission as a function of wavelength .",
    "the transmission is then used to calculate the effective optical depth .",
    "when binning over multiple pixels , each pixel is weighted by the inverse variance to reduce the effects of noise spikes due to bright sky emission lines . for cfhqsj2329 - 0301",
    "it is evident that the low s / n of this discovery spectrum prevents us from placing strong constraints on the optical depth of the igm along this line - of - sight .",
    "we detect flux in the region of ly@xmath8  absorption at @xmath46 , but not at higher redshifts . in a large bin covering the redshift range",
    "@xmath47 we measure a ly@xmath8  optical depth of @xmath48 . in the higher redshift bin of @xmath49",
    "we obtain only a @xmath50 limit on the optical depth of @xmath51 .",
    "this lower limit for the optical depth is considerably lower than the detections and limits for @xmath19 sdss quasars , so we do not discuss it further in this paper and await higher s / n spectroscopy .",
    "the spectrum of cfhqsj1509 - 1749 does have high enough s / n to investigate the optical depth of the igm .",
    "we bin the spectrum in intervals of @xmath52 to get the effective optical depth along this line - of - sight .",
    "we ensured that the highest redshift bin does not include flux that may be associated with the quasar proximity zone discussed in sec.[nearzone ] .",
    "values of ly@xmath8  transmission and effective optical depth are given in table [ tab : transtau ] .",
    "the uncertainties reflect only the photon noise , which is the dominant cause of measurement uncertainty .",
    "however , in most cases , this uncertainty is lower than the intrinsic cosmic variance ( fan et al .",
    "2006b ) .",
    "the ly@xmath53  transmission is measured only for the highest redshift bin .",
    "lower redshift bins of ly@xmath53  would overlap with the higher order lyman transitions .",

    "the quoted uncertainty does not include the uncertainty in the foreground ly@xmath8transmission .",
    "for this bin we detect zero flux in ly@xmath8  but there is a @xmath59 detection of flux in ly@xmath53 .",
    "this is because the oscillator strength for the ly@xmath53  transition is considerably lower than for ly@xmath8 .",
    "fig.[fig : trans ] plots transmission against redshift for the five ly@xmath8  bins and one ly@xmath53  bin . also plotted are ly@xmath8  transmissions for sdss quasars in fan et al .",
    "( 2006b ) .",
    "the solid curve is an extrapolation of the fit to @xmath56 quasars described above .",
    "this curve is consistent with the increasing absorption at higher redshifts being solely due to the increase in number density of ly@xmath8  forest clouds for typical model igm parameters ( miralda - escud et al .",
    "2000 ; see also the model curves in fig.[fig : tau ] ) ) .",
    "the ly@xmath8  data for cfhqsj1509 - 1749 lie close to the curve at @xmath60 but fall well below it at higher redshifts , indicating a sharp evolution in the hydrogen neutral fraction compared to the expected extrapolation .",
    "becker et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have cast doubt on this form for the expected evolution in transmission .",
    "they showed that the ly@xmath8  transmitted flux probability distributions of quasars at @xmath61 are better fit by lognormal optical depth distributions than the distributions from theoretical models such as miralda - escud et al .",
    "because the transmitted flux for the highest redshift quasars primarily depends upon the low optical depth tail of the distribution in voids , using the correct form for the optical depth distribution is important .",
    "the dashed curve in fig.[fig : trans ] shows the expected transmission evolution based on fits to quasars at @xmath60 by becker et al .",
    "it is clear that this curve falls much more rapidly than that of fan et al .",
    "( 2006b ) and is consistent with the @xmath62 data for no evolution in the hydrogen neutral fraction .",
    "however , the becker et al .",
    "curve does not do a good job of fitting the data at @xmath63 , where it predicts transmission considerably lower than most of the sdss data points .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to investigate the cause of this discrepancy , but we note that becker et al . used linear fits to evolution parameters , so it is perhaps not surprising that this linear fit can not accomodate the data at all redshifts .",
    "fig.[fig : tau ] shows the optical depth evolution . for the highest redshift bin ,",
    "the ly@xmath8  point is a @xmath50 lower limit . for the ly@xmath53  point",
    ", we plot the equivalent ly@xmath8  optical depth assuming @xmath64 ( fan et al . 2006b ; gnedin & fan 2006 ) .",
    "the ly@xmath8  limit is consistent with the ly@xmath53detection .",
    "the line - of - sight to cfhqsj1509 - 1749 shows one of the highest optical depth measurements at @xmath65 . as for the previous plot ,",
    "it is clear that there is a sharp evolution away from the fan et al .",
    "( 2006b ) low redshift curve at @xmath4 .",
    "assuming standard igm parameters ( e.g. fan et al .",
    "2001 ) , the optical depth evolution for cfhqsj1509 - 1749 is consistent with an increase in the igm hydrogen neutral fraction of a factor of three from @xmath66 to @xmath35 .    also plotted on fig.[fig : tau ] are two simulation results for the gunn - peterson optical depth evolution . the simulations of paschos & norman ( 2005 ; dotted curve )",
    "show no evolution away from the low redshift extrapolation in this redshift range because reionization is 99% complete by @xmath67 . our data and that of the sdss clearly show that the optical depth is greater than in this model at @xmath11 .",
    "the dot - dashed curve is the optical depth evolution for the l8n256 simulation of gnedin & fan ( 2006 ) . in these simulations",
    "the overlap period of reionization occurs at @xmath68 .",
    "the emissivity at @xmath69 in this model is set to match the sdss observations , so we should expect agreement at this redshift .",
    "this simulation predicts a very sharp increase in the optical depth at @xmath6 . as is evident from fig.[fig : tau ] , the actual evolution for cfhqsj1509 - 1749 and sdss quasars is somewhat more gradual than in this model .",
    "this suggests that the period of overlap is likely more extended than in the simple model .",
    "as highlighted by gnedin & fan ( 2006 ) , the optical depth at the end of overlap is dominated by lyman limit systems and simulations need to both resolve very small scales and cover very large scales .",
    "both simulations gives @xmath70 evolution during the epoch in which reionization is complete comparable to the fan et al .",
    "( 2006b ) curve and much flatter than the becker et al .",
    "( 2007 ) curve .",
    "we defer a more detailed comparison of the observed optical depth evolution with models until we have high s / n spectra of more cfhqs quasars .",
    "one of the difficulties of probing the hydrogen neutral fraction via quasar spectroscopy is that lyman series absorption is extremely efficient . because the density of the igm increases at high redshifts , a neutral fraction ( by volume ) of only @xmath71 at @xmath35 gives an optical depth at ly@xmath8  of @xmath72 ( e.g. fan et al .",
    "2006b ) .",
    "therefore it is useful to identify methods which are more sensitive to high neutral fractions .",
    "one of these which has been extensively studied in recent years is using the size of the region around the quasar which it has ionized .",
    "this is variously referred to as an hii region , stromgren sphere or highly - ionized near - zone .",
    "we will adopt the term near - zone as this does not imply that the surroundings are significantly neutral .    for a quasar embedded in a uniform density igm , the size of the ionization front from the quasar is proportional to @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76is the fraction of hydrogen in the igm that is neutral , @xmath77 is the number of ionizing photons emitted by the quasar per second and @xmath78 is the age of the quasar activity ( cen & haiman 2000 ; wyithe & loeb 2004 ) .",
    "note that the latter two terms could be combined into the total number of ionizing photons emitted so far by the quasar .",
    "therefore a measurement of the size of the ionization front ( from spectroscopy ) combined with knowledge of the number of ionizing photons emitted would give the neutral fraction .",
    "this method has been employed to argue that the highest redshift sdss quasars are embedded in a highly neutral igm ( @xmath76@xmath79 ; wyithe & loeb 2004 ; wyithe et al .",
    "2005 ; mesinger & haiman 2007 ) .",
    "however there are many complicating factors such as the uncertain density distribution close to luminous quasars and pre - ionization by associated galaxies ( yu & lu 2005 ) .",
    "uncertainty in the systemic redshifts can also be an issue leading to a typical uncertainty in the near - zone size of @xmath80mpc for redshifts from the ly@xmath8  line .",
    "an additional uncertainty comes from relating observations to simulations .",
    "defining the exact end of a near - zone from spectra is difficult .",
    "this is especially true for @xmath81 quasars which typically do not show gunn - peterson troughs immediately shortward of their near zones . in order to be able to define near - zone sizes for a wide range of spectra , fan et al .",
    "( 2006b ) adopted the definition as the point in the spectra where the ly@xmath8  transmission first dropped to @xmath82 for spectra binned in 20  pixels .",
    "most studies involving just those quasars at the upper end of the sdss redshift distribution ( e.g. wyithe et al .",
    "2005 ; yu & lu 2005 ) define the near - zone size as corresponding to the onset of the gunn - peterson trough ( typically @xmath83 ) .",
    "bolton & haehnelt ( 2007a ) discuss many of the uncertainties associated with using near - zone sizes to estimate @xmath76 .",
    "chief among these is the fact that the observed size may not correspond to the actual size of the ionized region due to significant residual neutral hydrogen left behind the ionization front .    as mentioned previously ,",
    "the sizes of near - zones are expected to be related to the quasar luminosity . for the classical case of an expanding hii  region",
    "the near - zone size is proportional to @xmath74 .",
    "bolton & haehnelt ( 2007a ) found the expected dependence to be @xmath84 for near - zones defined as @xmath82 .",
    "the cfhqs magnitude limit is 2.3 magnitudes fainter than that of the sdss meaning that the cfhqs quasars will be on average almost a factor of 10 lower in luminosity .",
    "therefore the cfhqs near - zone sizes are expected to be between @xmath85 times smaller than those in the sdss . comparing the near - zones sizes for the final cfhqs sample to the final sdss sample will allow a test of the luminosity dependence .    in the upper and middle panels of fig.[fig :",
    "nearzone ] we show the transmission in the spectrum of cfhqsj1509 - 1749 close to the quasar redshift .",
    "the middle panel shows the ly@xmath8  and ly@xmath53  transmission binned in 20  bins .",
    "it is seen that the ly@xmath8  transmission first drops below @xmath86 at a distance of 4.3mpc , but then rises up to @xmath87 in the next bin and then falls once more below @xmath86 at 6.4mpc .",
    "this behaviour of @xmath88 peaks beyond the distance where @xmath89 first drops below 0.1 is also seen in the near - zones of some sdss quasars ( fan et al .",
    "2006b ) and in the simulated quasar line - of - sight of bolton & haehnelt ( 2007a ) and is likely due to to the existence of low - density regions within the quasar near - zone .",
    "statistically significant transmission below the @xmath86 level is detected in bins at distances up to 12.7mpc .",
    "given these observations , what should we conclude about the size of the highly - ionized near - zone surrounding this quasar ?",
    "to further understand the properties of the near - zone we also show the binned ly@xmath53  transmission in the middle panel of fig.[fig : nearzone ] .",
    "these data have been statistically corrected for foreground ly@xmath8  absorption . excluding the first few mpc",
    ", there is statistically significant ly@xmath53  transmission all the way out to 12.7mpc .",
    "in fact , the ly@xmath53  optical depth in this region is considerably lower than expected given the observed ly@xmath8  optical depth , which suggests the foreground ly@xmath8  forest at @xmath90 along this line - of - sight is unusually transparent .",
    "the upper panel shows the ly@xmath8  and ly@xmath53  transmission ( this time without statistical correction of the foreground ly@xmath8  forest ) of the full resolution spectrum without binning . there is a correspondence between positive features in ly@xmath8  and ly@xmath53  at most places , although the correspondence in width and height of these features vary due to the varying foreground ly@xmath8  absorption .",
    "the transmission feature at 12mpc is clearly visible in ly@xmath53 . from the weakness of this feature at ly@xmath8",
    "we conclude that the ly@xmath53  feature is due both to a low - density region near the quasar and an unusually transparent patch at @xmath91 .",
    "we note , as emphasized by songaila ( 2004 ) , that if flux is detected at all at ly@xmath8 , it is better to adopt this measurement than to trust the apparently higher s / n ly@xmath53  measurement because of uncertainty in the foreground subtraction .",
    "nevertheless , the detection of positive flux in all ly@xmath8  bins out to 12.7mpc suggests that this is the true size of the zone impacted by the quasar ionizing flux .",
    "this is significantly greater than the 6.4mpc that would result from imposing a @xmath82 criterion .    throughout the above discussion",
    "we have assumed that the flux detected is not due to transparency caused by a very low neutral fraction ( @xmath92 ) in the igm beyond the quasar ionization front .",
    "there are a couple of facts supporting this assumption .",
    "first , there is significant flux detected in every ly@xmath53  bin from 3 to 12.7mpc and positive ( though not always significant ) ly@xmath8  flux in every bin . then at larger distances",
    ", the igm appears very opaque in ly@xmath8  and ly@xmath53  until there is some ly@xmath53  transmission at @xmath93mpc .",
    "the transmitted flux in the region 6.4 to 12.7mpc corresponds to an effective ly@xmath8  optical depth of @xmath94 .",
    "this is to be compared with the optical depth at similar redshift ( this region is @xmath95 ) and bin size along the lines - of - sight to all four highest redshift sdss quasars of @xmath96 ( fan et al .",
    "if the transmission at 6.4 to 12.7mpc is beyond the quasar ionization front , then the igm here has an unusually high ionizing background over a substantial redshift range .",
    "the lower panel of fig.[fig : nearzone ] shows the ly@xmath8transmission close to cfhqsj2329 - 0301 .",
    "the spectrum does not have a high enough s / n to provide useful ly@xmath53  data .",
    "the ly@xmath8  near - zone is remarkably similar to that of cfhqsj1509 - 1749 with the transmission first dropping below @xmath86 at a distance of 3.7mpc followed by a spike with @xmath88 and then falling below @xmath86 again at 6.3mpc . due to the lower s / n of the data we would not be able to detect any peaks at larger distances of comparable strength to those in cfhqsj1509 - 1749 .",
    "the cfhqs quasars are mostly of lower luminosity than those of the sdss so we must scale our near - zone sizes to a common luminosity before comparison with sdss quasars and simulations carried out to match sdss quasars .",
    "we scale the sizes to the equivalent for @xmath97 assuming @xmath98 .",
    "because cfhqsj1509 - 1749 has @xmath99 , no luminosity - scaling is necessary . for cfhqsj2329 - 0301 with @xmath100 , the near - zone size of 6.3mpc goes up to 10.8mpc after luminosity - scaling .",
    "we can compare the luminosity - scaled sizes of the cfhqs near - zones with those from the more luminous sdss quasars .",
    "bolton & haehnelt ( 2007b ) give the luminosity - scaled sizes of the ly@xmath8  near - zones measured from the four sdss quasars at @xmath15 ( excluding the broad absorption line quasar sdssj1048 + 4607 ) using a similar definition to us of the last pixel where @xmath88 .",
    "the four sdss near - zone sizes are 2.6 , 4.8 , 6.2 and 13.6mpc .",
    "our two cfhqs sizes of 6.4 and 10.8mpc are within the range of the sdss quasars , somewhat towards the upper end of the distribution .",
    "although there are many uncertainties associated with using the near - zone sizes to estimate the neutral fraction of the igm that the quasar ionization front expands into , the finding of relatively large near - zone sizes in the two cfhqs quasars does allow us to determine some constraints .",
    "firstly , as shown by bolton & haehnelt ( 2007a ) , there is little dependence upon the quasar lifetime if @xmath101 and/or at @xmath102yrs because in these cases the observed near - zone size depends not on the expanding ionization front , but on the residual neutral hydrogen left behind the ionization front .",
    "both short lifetimes and high neutral fractions lead to small near - zone sizes , so we can safely assume that quasar lifetime is not a factor .",
    "bolton & haehnelt ( 2007b ) simulated many quasar lines - of - sight with parameters of @xmath97 and @xmath103yrs .",
    "they found that for @xmath104 , the near - zone sizes are all @xmath105mpc . at @xmath106 ,",
    "the average near - zone size is @xmath107mpc with a range up to @xmath108mpc .",
    "the only simulated near - zone sizes greater than @xmath109mpc come from simulations with @xmath110 .",
    "the luminosity - scaled sizes for the two cfhqs quasar near - zones are 6.4 and 10.8mpc",
    ". therefore we can be quite confident that neither quasar is located in an igm with @xmath104 . for cfhqsj2329 - 0301 at @xmath1 with a luminosity - scaled near - zone size of 10.8mpc ,",
    "a very highly ionized igm is inferred . even if the quasar redshift has been overestimated by @xmath111 , then the observed near - zone size of 5.2mpc",
    "would still give a luminosity - scaled size of 9.0mpc .",
    "for both quasars , the quasar radiation is emitted into a substantially pre - ionized igm .",
    "this indicates that these locations had already been reionized to @xmath112 at their respective redshifts of @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "several authors have suggested that because luminous quasars are expected to form in rare overdense regions , the surrounding igm had already been pre - ionized by galaxies ( yu & lu 2005 ; alvarez & abel 2007 ; lidz et al .",
    "the possibility that quasar near - zones do not represent typical regions of the igm must always be kept in mind when interpreting results such as these .",
    "however , we note that the lower luminosities of most cfhqs quasars , such as cfhqsj2329 - 0301 , mean they are expected to be powered by less massive black holes hosted in less rare , lower mass dark matter halos , reducing the likelihood of pre - ionization by cluster galaxies .",
    "we have presented the discovery of four new cfhqs quasars at @xmath6 .",
    "these were discovered from incomplete follow - up of less than half the final survey area and we expect many more quasars to be found in the next few years . we have discussed the observed properties of the quasars including emission lines , intervening absorption lines , continuum slopes and dust reddening .",
    "sensitive millimeter continuum observations have been carried out with mambo at the iram 30 m telescope .",
    "one of the four quasars has been securely detected .",
    "this strong dust continuum is likely due to a high star formation rate in its host galaxy .",
    "the mean 1.2 mm flux of the cfhqs quasars is substantially lower than the mean 1.2 mm flux of sdss quasars at similar redshifts .",
    "this is indicative of a luminosity - dependence of the dust continuum emission .",
    "we have investigated the constraints that the discovery spectra can put on the ionization state of the igm . for all but one quasar , higher",
    "s / n spectroscopy are required to perform a full analysis of the igm properties .",
    "cfhqsj1509 - 1749 at @xmath3 shows significant igm optical depth evolution from @xmath66 to @xmath35 .",
    "the highest redshift bin at @xmath113 has an effective optical depth of @xmath114 , which is one of the highest effective optical depths found at this redshift and consistent with a factor of three increase in @xmath76  from @xmath66 .",
    "both cfhqsj1509 - 1749 and cfhqsj2329 - 0301 have large highly - ionized near - zones of at least 6 proper mpc .",
    "these large near - zones are inconsistent with quasar ionization fronts expanding into a highly neutral ( @xmath115 ) igm ( bolton & haehnelt 2007b ) .",
    "our results are broadly consistent with the ( mass - averaged ) value of @xmath116 at @xmath117 determined by fan et al .",
    "( 2006b ) from evolution of sdss quasar near - zone sizes .",
    "our strongest constraint is from cfhqsj2329 - 0301 at @xmath1 which has a luminosity - scaled near - zone size of 10.8mpc which is only consistent with @xmath118 .",
    "in addition , the lower luminosity of this quasar compared to sdss quasars makes it less likely that its surroundings were pre - ionized by cluster galaxies .",
    "taking together the results of ( i ) a significant increase in the igm optical depth at @xmath5 ( for cfhqsj1509 - 1749 and also observed in the sdss ) and ( ii ) the low neutral fractions inferred from the near - zones of cfhqs ( and some sdss ) @xmath15 quasars , suggest that reionization is well under way before @xmath67 but is still not complete by @xmath119 .",
    "this is a more extended period than results from most simple models where overlap occurs rapidly .",
    "finally we note that cosmic variance is still a significant issue for the highest redshift quasars and that many more quasars at @xmath15 are required to accurately determine the igm evolution at @xmath6 .",
