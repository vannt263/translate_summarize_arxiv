    "semigroups of dynamical maps are used to describe the time - evolution of open quantum systems @xmath0 in weak interaction with suitable external environments , typically an infinite heath bath in equilibrium at a given temperature acting as a source of dissipation and noise .",
    "they have been successfully used in many phenomenological applications in quantum chemistry , quantum optics , statistical physics @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we shall consider qubits described by density matrices @xmath1 , corresponding to three dimensional real vectors of length @xmath2 in the bloch sphere , that evolve in time under the action of semigroups of linear maps @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "formally , these arise from the exponentiation of a generator @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and satisfy the forward in time composition law @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "a preliminary natural request on the maps @xmath3 is that they send any initial state @xmath1 into another state @xmath9 $ ] at all @xmath4 , namely that they map the bloch sphere into itself . only in such a way",
    ", the spectrum of an evolving @xmath1 remains positive and its eigenvalues can be interpreted as probabilities .",
    "such a property of the maps @xmath3 is called _ positivity_. in line of principle , it is not sufficient to guarantee full physical consistency of the maps @xmath3 : a more restrictive property , namely _ complete positivity _ , need be imposed @xcite . in such a way , not only the positivity of @xmath3 is guaranteed , but also that of the amplified map @xmath10 ; this describes the time - evolution of a qubit @xmath0 statistically coupled to an ancillary qubit which remains inert under the action of the identity operation @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , complete positivity of @xmath3 fully characterizes the form of the generator @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the case of a qubit system , there appears a characteristic order relation ( @xmath12 ) between the decay times of the diagonal ( @xmath13 ) and off - diagonal ( @xmath14 ) entries of its time - evolving density matrix @xcite .",
    "the semigroup @xmath3 describes the reduced dynamics of the immersed qubit @xmath0 when the environment degrees of freedom have been eliminated and the memory effects due to a short transient regime have been got rid of by means of suitable markovian approximations . if not performed with due care , these latter lead to reduced dynamics neither completely positive , nor even positive .",
    "absence of positivity of @xmath3 means that there are initial density matrices @xmath1 that may , in the course of time , develop negative eigenvalues and thus lose their meaning as physical states .",
    "if one wants to stick to non - positive reduced dynamics , a possible way out of physical inconsistencies amounts to assuming that not all density matrices are allowed as initial conditions for @xmath3 , but only those which do not develop negative eigenvalues .",
    "the mechanism which eliminates the unwanted initial states is ascribed to the transient regime which rules the time behavior of the subsystem @xmath0 before one can legitimately use the semigroup @xmath3 .",
    "namely , prior to @xmath3 , the environment action on the subsystem is via a map @xmath15 that projects the whole state space of @xmath0 , @xmath16 , into a subset of `` good '' states @xmath17 , so that @xmath18 acts as a positive map on @xmath16 , even if @xmath3 does not .    the map @xmath15 is known in the literature as _ slippage of initial conditions _",
    "@xcite , its introduction being motivated by the the difficulty to accept that a physical effect like the decay - times hierarchy of a qubit be induced by its possible entanglement with an uncontrollable external ancillary qubit , a seemingly academic , abstract scenario with philosophical overtones .    on the other hand , quantum information and communication theories have amply demonstrated the role of entanglement as a concrete physical resource and developed techniques both theoretical and experimental for its manipulation @xcite . it is thus not only of academical interest to study the slippage - approach in relation to entanglement ; more precisely , we shall be interested in setting the ground to answer the following question .",
    "suppose the inconsistencies of a non - positive @xmath3 have been cured by considering a _ slipped _",
    "which kind of effects has @xmath19 on the entangled states of @xmath20 ?",
    "aim of this paper is to extend a previous result @xcite in order to indicate which kind of pathologies may arise from amplifications of slipped non - positive semigroups acting on bipartite systems .",
    "given an environment , its associated slippage operator @xmath15 is far from being technically accessible as a mathematical object and such are its effective properties .",
    "we shall thus model @xmath15 by the simplest map with the prescribed slippage properties and then discuss its action on the isotropic states @xcite of a two qubit systems , one qubit immersed in a dephasing environment and the other one external to it .",
    "we shall show that , by preceding it by a suitable slippage operator @xmath15 , a non - positive reduced dynamical map @xmath3 can indeed be turned into a completely positive map @xmath18 , but also that , unless strongly slipped , the maps @xmath3 can , acting locally , create entanglement , a fundamentally non - local property .",
    "furthermore , we shall present instances of cases where the necessary strong slippage results in the elimination of all isotropic entangled states .",
    "we take this as an indication of a general behavior : in the weak - coupling regime , slipped non - completely positive dynamics appear to be incompatible with entanglement .",
    "in this section , we shall briefly review the standard approach to open quantum dynamics , namely the so - called weak - coupling limit .",
    "the typical physical context is represented by a finite - dimensional ( @xmath21-level ) subsystem @xmath0 in weak interaction with an environment @xmath22 , this latter corresponding to an infinite dimensional reservoir in equilibrium at some fixed temperature @xmath23 .",
    "the space of states @xmath16 of @xmath0 consists of @xmath24 density matrices @xmath25 , while the state of the environment @xmath26 is taken to be an equilibrium state @xmath26 .",

    "when the interaction between @xmath0 and @xmath22 is weak ( @xmath34 ) , it makes sense to derive a so - called _ reduced dynamics _ , namely a description of the time - evolution of @xmath0 involving the system @xmath0 alone",
    ". the derivation amounts to the elimination of the degrees of freedom of @xmath22 while retaining the effects of their presence on @xmath0 ; the resulting time - evolution is irreversible , in general non - linear , and dominated by memory effects . by assuming the initial state of @xmath27 to be of the uncorrelated form @xmath35 , non - linearities are automatically eliminated and the standard _ projection technique",

    "also , if @xmath0 is coupled to another @xmath0 , amplified positive maps @xmath48 would preserve the positivity of any separable state @xmath51 however , since there are states of @xmath20 , the _ entangled _ ones , which can not be written as in  ( [ sepstates ] ) , when @xmath48 acts on anyone of them , the positivity of the eigenvalues of @xmath52 $ ] can be preserved if and only if @xmath45 is not only positive , but also completely positive .",

    "if @xmath149 , we have already seen that the channel @xmath170 can cure non - positivity by multiplying the pauli matrices by @xmath218 where @xmath152 is given in  ( [ slip03 ] ) . from  ( [ slip02 ] ) and  ( [ eigv5 ] ) it follows that @xmath219 so that @xmath220 ; namely , the maximal radius of the sphere of slipped initial conditions suggested by the single qubit non - positive dynamics is too large for keeping physical consistency against entanglement .",
    "the radius is to be decreased to at least @xmath221 .    in the following",
    "we shall see that even the value @xmath221 does not keep the non - positive dynamics free from pathologies ; however , the ones we are going to expose are much more intriguing and subtler than the appearance of negative eigenvalues , being instead related to the creation of entanglement by means of the local action of maps of the form @xmath169 .",

    "we are now interested in the change of entanglement with time ; from proposition 5.1 , we know @xmath224 can not increase if @xmath3 is completely positive .",

    "therefore , if in the same neighborhood @xmath245 , then the entanglement of @xmath187 increases by the local action of the non positive @xmath3 , an apparent physical inconsistency , for , as already noticed , physically , entanglement can be created by non - local operations only .    in order to check this possibility , we compare the bound @xmath246 , which is necessary to physical consistency of the @xmath187 as states at all times , with the lower bound which ensures positive concurrence",

    "it turns out that , in such cases , in order to ensure physical consistency , @xmath170 must destroy all entangled isotropic states .",
    "these results may appear surprising , but can be explained by looking at the structure of the states @xmath187 and their entanglement characterization .",
    "indeed , one knows that the so - called _ entanglement of formation _",
    "@xcite is a monotonically increasing function of the concurrence @xcite and , moreover , that it can not increase under local quantum operations .",
    "this seems to conflict with the fact that the local action of @xmath10 may increase the concurrence and hence the entanglement of formation .",
    "however , there is no contradiction : in fact , @xmath3 is not positive , whereas a quantum operation is by definition completely positive .",
    "it is of some interest to inspect in more detail how non - positivity may generate entanglement by acting locally .",
    "let us then consider the explicit expression of the entanglement of formation , @xmath265 where @xmath266 is the von neumann entropy of the marginal states of party @xmath127 resulting from partial trace over party @xmath267 , @xmath268 , obtained from those that contribute to the convex decomposition @xmath269 , @xmath270 , @xmath271 .",

    "we have proved that there are times @xmath277 such that @xmath278 $ ] and @xmath279 $ ] are well - defined entangled isotropic states satisfying @xmath280 . from the argument of above",
    ", such inequality can hold only if @xmath10 acting on an optimal decomposition of @xmath281 does not provide a decomposition of @xmath187 , namely only if at least one of the states optimally decomposing @xmath281 are not mapped into density matrices by @xmath10 .    to summarize , by resorting to the slippage mechanism , one may force a non - positive time - evolution @xmath10 to map a class of entangled states into states at all times , but it may happen that this local action increases their entanglement because it is the positivity of the spectrum of other entangled states , outside that class , which is spoiled in the course of time .",
    "we have considered a concrete model of reduced dynamics for a single qubit weakly interacting with a stochastic environment and derived a reduced dynamics depending on two parameters .",
    "the resulting semigroup consists of maps @xmath3 that range from non - positive to positive and completely positive .",
    "the physical meaning of complete positivity is related to the existence of entangled states and can thus be fully appreciated only when the open qubit is correlated to an ancilla . far from being abstract and out of experimental control ,",
    "an entangled qubit pair one of whose parties experiences a noisy channel is a typical theoretical and practical context of quantum information and communication theory . in these cases ,",
    "complete positivity can not be dispensed with , otherwise physical inconsistencies immediately appear , typically the presence of negative probabilities in the spectrum of evolving entangled density matrices which lose their meaning as physical states .    in relation to entanglement , we have studied an approach , the so - called slippage of initial conditions , whereby complete positivity is deemed an abstract request devoid of physical content and as such refused as an unnecessary constraint on the open quantum dynamics .",
    "this means that one prefers to stick to a non - positive markovian reduced dynamics and try to cure in some way or the other its pathological behavior .",
    "indeed , already for a single qubit , one has to enforce a selection of the admissible initial states which is supposedly due to the action of the transient regime .    by means of a simple ( completely positive ) slippage operator @xmath170 , @xmath282 , we have turned non - positive reduced dynamical maps @xmath3 into completely positive ones , @xmath169 , that eliminate the presence of negative eigenvalues from the spectrum of time - evolving single qubit states .",
    "however , we have showed that @xmath10 acting on the isotropic states @xmath283 $ ] , may increase their entanglement by acting locally .",
    "such an unphysical possibility is due to the non - positivity of @xmath3 and can be eliminated by resorting to further slippage operators that may result in the whole elimination of entangled isotropic states .    despite the simplicity of the model , we believe it contains the salient features of a more general structure : sticking to non - completely positive reduced dynamics , though cured by some suitable slippage mechanism , would conflict with the presence of entanglement . in some particular cases discussed in this paper , the conflict can only be avoided by the drastic elimination , via a suitable slippage , of whole classes of entangled states .",
    "to conclude , slipped non-(completely ) positive semigroups present two different contradictory aspects in relation to entanglement : on one hand , the slippage operated by the bath during the transient phase seems to hamper the possibility of creating entanglement by embedding two dynamically uncorrelated parties within a same environment , as discussed in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "unless all entangled states are eliminated by the slippage beforehand , the subsequent markovian time - evolution may look like being able to create entanglement by acting locally .",
    "however , this entanglement creation is a spurious artifact : it is due to some entangled state , not destroyed by the slippage , which develops negative probabilities while evolving in time . as a consequence ,",
    "curing non - positive markovian evolutions through the slippage operation appears to be rather unsatisfactory and physically unviable .",
