    "<S> the stretching of an ( ideal ) polymer provides one of the most beautiful illustrations of thermodynamics and equilibrium statistical physics . </S>",
    "<S> a force is needed because the number of polymer configurations corresponding to a stretched state is ( exponentially ) smaller than that of the folded state . </S>",

    "<S> the issue of elasticity is an important one in materials science . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the ( harmonic ) elastic regime , which can be estimated from the ratio of the tensile strength over the young s modulus , varies greatly from very small , for example for nanotubes , to very large for rubber and elastine @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore natural to ask whether variations of a basic microscopic model , such as the freely - jointed chain , can lead to a predominant or even perfect harmonic response . </S>",
    "<S> the immediate answer appears to be yes : the rouse model @xcite supposes monomers that are perfectly harmonic and hence so is the entire chain . </S>",
    "<S> but the assumption of perfectly harmonic monomers is unphysical as it would for example imply that both the monomer and polymer can be stretched indefinitely . </S>",
    "<S> and deriving harmonicity from harmonicity is not exactly a great feat . </S>",
    "<S> the surprising finding of this letter is the discovery of a polymer with non - harmonic monomers which is and remains perfectly harmonic up to full extension ( and not beyond ) .    before proceeding to the more technical derivation , we comment on the route that led to this discovery and the additional results that were obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical physics literature on polymers is huge , but exact results can only be derived for some very simple models such as the freely - jointed chain . </S>",
    "<S> one of the main tools to arrive at these results is the evaluation of the partition function via a transfer matrix method , essentially by identifying the largest eigenvalue . </S>",
    "<S> such transfer matrices have positive entries and are therefore reminiscent of markov matrices , which describe the dynamics of markov chains . </S>",

    "<S> the bonus is that the largest eigenvalue of such a transfer matrix is determined by a simple explicit algebraic equation . </S>",
    "<S> applications include the free energy calculation for various equilibrium systems , including polymer chains with persistence . </S>",

    "<S> we do something similar here by adding an extra boltzmann factor to the transfer matrix , with @xmath33 representing the energy contribution due to such a field on layer @xmath28 , leading finally to the following  kubo - anderson \" transfer matrix : @xmath34 the connection with the corresponding interaction energy @xmath35 is obtained by comparison with eq .  </S>",
