    "a satisfactorily empirical corroboration of a fundamental theory requires that as many independent experiments as possible are conducted by different scientists in different laboratories .",
    "now , general relativity is difficult to test , especially in the weak - field and slow - motion approximation , valid , e.g. , in our solar system , both because the relativistic effects are very small and the competing classical signals are often quite larger .",
    "until now , solar system tests of general relativity accurate to better than 1@xmath4 have been performed by many independent groups only in the gravitational field of the sun by checking the effects induced by the gravitoelectric schwarzschild test performed in the gravitational field of mars with the mgs spacecraft has recently been reported in ref .  .",

    "it is as if many independent experiments aimed to measure fundamental physical effects were conducted always in the same laboratory .",
    "thus , it is worthwhile to try to use different laboratories , i.e. other gravitational fields , to perform such tests , even if their outcomes should be less accurate than those conducted in the sun s field . in principle , the best candidates other than the sun are the giant planets of the solar system like jupiter and saturn . to date , the only investigations of this kind are due to hiscock and lindblom@xcite , who preliminarily analyzed the possibility of measuring the einstein pericentre precessions@xcite of some of the natural satellites of jupiter and saturn , and to iorio and lainey@xcite who investigated the measurability of the lense - thirring precessions in the system of the galilean satellites of jupiter with modern data sets .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate if the recent improvements in the ephemerides of the major saturnian satellites ( see table  [ param ] for their orbital parameters ) obtained from the first cassini data allows to detect at least the general relativistic gravitoelectric precessions of their orbits .",

    "is it possible to measure the gravitoelectric orbital precessions of the natural satellites of saturn , in view of the recent refinements of their ephemerides obtained by analyzing the first data from the cassini spacecraft ? in this section we will address this problem in detail . to this aim , we must confront the magnitude of the relativistic effects of interest with the major systematic errors induced by classical forces having the same signatures ( section  [ evzon ] ) , and with the currently available measurement accuracies ( section  [ accur ] ) .      in regard to the first issue , a major source of systematic bias is represented by the even zonal harmonic coefficients @xmath20 of the multipolar expansion of the saturn s gravitational potential .",

    "even the latest determinations of the saturnian gravity field from some cassini data sets@xcite show that the currently available models of the even zonal harmonics do not reach the required accuracy to allow for a measurement of the einstein precessions .",
    "this fact is clearly shown by table  [ tablong ] .    indeed , we can note that for mimas , enceladus and thetys the mismodelled precessions due to @xmath23 and @xmath24 are larger than the relativistic rates by about one order of magnitude .",

    "the cancellation of the low - degree even zonals is important also because in this way one avoids any possible a priori ` imprint ' of the relativistic effects themselves via such spherical harmonics .",
    "indeed , the saturnian gravity field models are obtained as least - square solutions using all the available data from the spacecraft encounters and the satellites motions around saturn , so that the relativistic effects themselves are in some way included in the solved - for parameters like @xmath25 .    a possible combination which cancels out @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath32 is = , with @xmath36 as can be argued from table  [ tablong ] ,",
    "the impact of the remaining uncancelled even zonal harmonics @xmath37 is negligible .      in regard to the feasibility of such a measurement",

    "this fact reflects on itself : indeed the total uncertainty calculated by summing in quadrature the errors @xmath40 of table  [ err ] with the coefficients ( [ coe ] ) .|_= is @xmath41 times larger than the gravitoelectric shift over 81 years .    about the use of the inner satellites , for which the relativistic shifts @xmath42",
    "are larger than the errors @xmath40 , table  [ tablong ] shows that it is not possible to use their mean longitudes without combining them because both the even zonal mismodelled shifts and the bias of @xmath19 are quite larger . on the other hand",
    ", it turns out that also the linear combination approach does not yield good results .",
    "indeed , the root - sum - square of the errors of a combination with enceladus , dione , rhea and titan is @xmath2 times larger of the relativistic combined shifts .",
    "in regard to the measurability of the general relativistic gravitoelectric orbit advances in the saturn s system of natural satellites , it turns out that the present - day improvements in their ephemerides by the cassini spacecraft are not yet sufficient to detect such post - newtonian effects .    as a general rule , in regard to the single satellites , an about one order of magnitude improvement in the knowledge of the parameters of the saturnian gravity field like the even zonal harmonics @xmath0 and @xmath1 would be required to make the competing classical bias smaller than the relativistic precessions .",
    "this would make possible to successfully analyze separately the mean longitudes of each of mimas , enceladus , thetys , dione , rhea and titan because the present - day down - track errors are already smaller than the relativistic shifts .",
    "the use of the mean longitudes of hyperion , iapetus and phoebe , for which the saturnian even zonals represent a relatively less important problem , is strictly related to a one - two orders of magnitude improvements in the down - track parts of their orbits .    the linear combination approach yields , in principle , good results in reducing the impact of the mismodelling in the even zonals and @xmath1 .",
    "the main problem with such strategy relies in the down - track orbital accuracy .",
    "indeed , the down - track errors weighted by their combination s coefficients must be summed in quadrature , while the weighted relativistic shifts are combined with their proper own signs , so that with the present - day precision the overall error amounts to @xmath2 .",
