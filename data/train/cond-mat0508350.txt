    "compounds in the series based on composition agpb@xmath0sbte@xmath1  can exhibit exceptional thermoelectric properties.@xcite they are promising for electrical power generation and in the temperature range 600 to 900 kelvin , they are expected to significantly outperform all other reported bulk thermoelectric systems . the dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit , @xmath4,@xcite of the @xmath5 composition material was found to reach 1.7 at 700 kelvin , compared to the highest observed zt of only 0.84 for pbte at 648 kelvin in n - doped material.@xcite@xmath6  @xcite this is a surprisingly large enhancement in @xmath4 for the addition of just 10% per formula - unit of silver and antimony ions .",
    "it is clearly of the greatest importance to trace the origin of the @xmath4 enhancement .",
    "high resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem ) images from these materials indicate the presence of nanosized domains of a ag - sb - rich phase endotaxially embedded in the pbte  matrix.@xcite an interesting possibility is that these nanoclusters are key components in the @xmath4  enhancement .",
    "the hrtem images show the clusters are randomly distributed through the matrix and are not long - range ordered .",
    "randomly distributed nano - scale clusters which strain the lattice might be expected to increase phonon scattering and reduce the thermal conductivity which would enhance @xmath4 provided the electrical conductivity was not degraded to a greater degree . an additional enhancement in @xmath4 is possible if the material has an increased electronic density of states ( dos ) at the fermi - level , @xmath7 .",
    "a recent theoretical analysis showed that resonant structures form in the dos near @xmath7 in the presence of ordered ag and sb atoms in the matrix and in the nanoclusters observed in hrtem.@xcite@xmath6  @xcite the calculations used gradient corrected density functional theory and assumed different structural models for the clusters , since details of their structure and chemical ordering are not known .",
    "this type of dos resembles that of the  best thermoelectric material \" predicted earlier .",
    "@xcite    the composition and atomic arrangements within the nanoclusters is a challenging topic since the clusters are not periodically long - range ordered .",
    "they are dispersed inside a matrix and can not be studied crystallographically . a probing method sensitive to local structure",
    "is needed such as the atomic pair distribution function ( pdf ) analysis of x - ray powder diffraction data.@xcite in the past decade the pdf technique has emerged as a powerful tool for obtaining local structural information from complex materials.@xcite it is a total scattering method that takes into account both bragg and diffuse scattering information and gives structural information in real space on various length scales .",
    "recently , it was successfully used to study chemical short - range ordered clusters randomly embedded in a parent matrix,@xcite in analogy with the present situation . here",
    "we report a pdf study of a series of compounds in the agpb@xmath0sbte@xmath1  series with @xmath8 , 12 and 18 .",
    "for comparison we also studied the end member compound , pbte the @xmath9 member of the series .",
    "the resulting pdfs have sufficiently high quality to see a structural signature of the nanoclusters , even in the pbte - rich @xmath10 compound .",
    "these differences were sufficiently large to allow different models of the local structure to be differentiated , confirming the existence of the clusters in the bulk , and narrowing down their composition and the atomic arrangement in the clusters .",
    "ingots with nominal compositions agpb@xmath11sbte@xmath12 , agpb@xmath13sbte@xmath14and ag@xmath15pb@xmath16sbte@xmath17  were synthesized by annealing , in quartz tubes under vacuum , mixtures of ag , pb , sb , and te elements at 1000 @xmath18c for 8 h. this was followed by a fast cooling to 850 @xmath18c for 1 h , slow cooling to 800 @xmath18c for 12 h , and then cooling to 400 @xmath18c for 12 h. this method of cooling produces more consistent samples .",
    "x - ray diffraction measurements were made on the agpb@xmath0sbte@xmath1  series of materials with @xmath19 12 , 18 and @xmath20 at room temperature using the recently developed rapid acquisition pair distribution function ( ra - pdf ) approach@xcite at the mu - cat 6-id - d beam - line at the advanced photon source ( aps ) at argonne national laboratory .",
    "x - ray powder diffraction samples were prepared by carefully grinding the compounds in a mortar and pestle and sieving through a 400-mesh sieve .",
    "the powders were packed into hollow flat aluminum plate sample containers with a radius of 0.25  cm and thickness of 1.0  mm , sealed between thin kapton films .",
    "the x - ray energy used was 87.005  kev ( @xmath21   ) .",
    "the data were collected using a circular image plate ( ip ) camera mar345 , 345  mm in diameter .",
    "the camera was mounted orthogonally to the beam path with a sample - to - detector distance of 208.86  mm which was determined by calibrating with a silicon standard sample.@xcite    in order to avoid saturation of the detector , each measurement was carried out by multiple exposure to the x - rays .",
    "each exposure lasted 10 seconds , and each sample was exposed five times to improve the counting statistics .",
    "an example of the raw data on the image plate is shown in fig .",

    "data sets for the same sample were combined using the same program .",
    "data for the empty container were also collected and subtracted from the sample data during the correction step .",
    "standard corrections for multiple scattering , polarization , absorption , compton scattering and laue diffuse scattering were applied to the integrated data to obtain the reduced total structure function @xmath26 , as described in detail in refs .",

    "the good statistics in the high-@xmath28 region of the data ( fig .",
    "[ fig;lin_figure1](b ) ) allowed a @xmath29  @xmath24 to be used which gives high - quality pdfs with good resolution .",

    "the difference curves show fluctuations that are much larger than the estimated random errors on the data and therefore have a real origin , encoding the local structural differences between the agpb@xmath0sbte@xmath1  and pbte  compounds .",
    "the fluctuations in the difference curves are highly correlated between the different @xmath31-values , growing in amplitude from @xmath10 , 12 to 6 , as expected .",
    "this suggests that the local structures in each case are similar and gives some confidence that the results from lower @xmath31-value compounds can give insight about higher @xmath31-members .",
    "it also gives us confidence that the smaller ripples in the difference curve from the @xmath10 compound have a real structural origin .",
    "structural information was extracted from the pdfs using a full - profile real - space local - structure refinement method@xcite analogous to rietveld refinement.@xcite we used an updated version@xcite of the program pdffit@xcite to fit the experimental pdfs .",
    "pdffit allows for multiple data - sets to be refined and can also handle multiple phases . starting from a given structure model and given a set of parameters to be refined , pdffit searches for the best structure that is consistent with the experimental pdf data . the residual function ( @xmath32 )",
    "is used to quantify the agreement of the calculated pdf from model to experimental data :    @xmath33 ^ 2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\omega ( r_{i})g_{obs}^{2}(r_{i})}}\\ ] ]    here the weight @xmath34 is set to unity .    in this modeling",
    "we took advantage of the ability to refine multiple phases in pdffit .",
    "we searched for domains of ag and sb rich material embedded in the pbte matrix .",
    "provided we fit the pdf over a range of @xmath35 that is much less than the particle diameter , it is a good approximation to model the data as being made up of two distinct phases .",
    "this neglects cross - terms ; i.e. , atom pairs where one atom is in one phase and the neighboring atom is in the other phase .",
    "however , our experience suggests that these terms are small and a reasonable and simple starting point is to neglect these terms and model the phases as distinct ( i.e. , incoherent ) .",
    "the hrtem images suggest that the nano - cluster domains have diameters of the order of a few nanometers and our fitting is carried out over a range up to 20   .",
    "thus , some inconsistencies in the fits in the high-@xmath35 range should be attributable to the neglected cross - terms .",
    "this approximation can be removed in the future , but only at the expense of having to fit the data with very large models .",
    "the success of the current modeling seems to suggest that this is not warranted at this point .    in pdffit",
    ", each phase in the multi - phase mixture has its own scale - factor that is refined .",
    "this scale factor reflects both the relative phase - fraction of the phases , but also any differences in the scattering power of the two phases , which depends on the respective compositions of the phases . here",
    "we present the equations that allow us to extract phase fractions from the refined scale factors of the phases . in pdffit",
    ", the total pdf @xmath22 is defined as a summation of the different phases as follows : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the overall scale factor and @xmath38 is an experimental resolution factor for data set @xmath39 .",
    "the sum is over the different structural phases , @xmath40 , in a multiphase refinement and @xmath41 is the model pdf for a single phase @xmath40 .",
    "the weighted abundance of each phase is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the averaged scattering factors for phase @xmath40 and the whole sample , respectively , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the total atom number for phase @xmath40 and the whole sample .",
    "we can easily calculate @xmath47 from the stoichiometry of phase @xmath40 and the whole sample .",
    "after refinement we extract @xmath47 from the weighted scale factor and then compare it to the calculated one to see whether the refinement result is self - consistent with the known stoichiometry .",
    "for example , let s suppose we use two phases pbte  and agpb@xmath48sbte@xmath49  to model agpb@xmath0sbte@xmath1  .",
    "we can set up the following two equations to get @xmath50 and @xmath51 : @xmath52 and @xmath53 since @xmath54 and @xmath31 are known we can extract the expected ratio @xmath47 for comparison with the value obtained from the refinement .    to test this procedure",
    ", we used a sample made by mechanically mixing pbte  and agsbte@xmath55  powders with atom number ratio of 1:3 and carried out a two - phase refinement .",
    "the refined value of @xmath47 was 0.69 compared to the expected values of 0.75 .",
    "this suggests that we can obtain the phase fractions to an accuracy at the 10% level .",
