    "the maximum transportable current density of an ion beam with high space - charge intensity propagating in a periodic focusing lattice is a problem of practical importance@xcite .",
    "accelerator applications such as heavy ion fusion ( hif ) , high energy density physics ( hedp ) , and transmutation of nuclear waste demand a large flux of particles on target .",
    "a limit to the maximum current density can result from a variety of factors : instability of low - order moments of the beam describing the centroid and envelope , instability of higher order collective modes internal to the beam , growth in statistical phase - space area ( rms emittance growth ) , excessive halo generation , and species contamination associated with issues such as the electron cloud problem .",
    "simulations were first used to analyze the maximum current density transportable in quadrupole channels@xcite and provided guidance beyond initial heuristic estimates@xcite .",
    "experiments later obtained results consistent with simulations@xcite .",
    "the present work describes a promising new approach toward predicting the maximum transportable current density in a periodic quadrupole lattice due to intrinsic space - charge limits@xcite .",
    "previous studies to predict space - charge related transport limits in the absence of focusing errors and species contamination have not proved fully successful beyond a moment level description of low - order beam instabilities .",
    "although moment - based centroid and envelope descriptions reliably predict regions of parametric instability where machines can not operate@xcite , such models are overly optimistic when compared to simulations and experiments which observe degraded transport due to emittance growth and particle losses where the moment models predict stability@xcite . on the other hand , higher - order collective mode theories based on the equilibrium kv distribution@xcite predict broad parametric regions of instability where stability is observed in simulations with more realistic distributions@xcite and in experiment@xcite . the space - charge limit model proposed is based on particles oscillating outside , but near the beam edge exchanging energy with the oscillating space - charge field of a envelope matched beam core leading to increased particle oscillation amplitude , emittance blow up , and particle losses .",
    "this model can be applied to a wide range of matched core distributions and does not require an equilibrium core  which circumvents the practical problem of no smooth core equilibrium distribution being known .",

    ", the plasma response of the beam will have characteristic collective phase advance @xmath104 this frequency will generally be incommensurate with and much slower than the temperature oscillations showing showing that the edge of the beam will have a more difficult time readapting to the focusing kicks as @xmath0 increase and envelope flutter becomes larger .",
    "a core - particle model was used to analyze the previously unexplained origin of space - charge related transport limits of beams propagating in periodic quadrupole focusing channels .",
    "it was shown that when matched beam envelope oscillations and space - charge strength are both sufficiently large , near - edge particles oscillating both inside and outside the matched beam envelope become chaotic and can experience large increases in oscillation amplitude .",
    "this resonance halo need not be tenuous and is distinct from envelope mismatch driven halo@xcite because the driving oscillation is the fast flutter of the matched beam envelope rather than envelope mismatch modes . the matched envelope flutter becomes larger with increasing @xmath0 , providing a strong pump that further increases as beam space - charge forces become larger .",
    "envelope oscillations also drive large temperature oscillations in the core of the matched envelope .",
    "because the collective response of the beam to local force imbalances scales with the plasma frequency which is low relative to the lattice frequency , it is unlikely that the beam edge can consistently adapt .",
    "lack of edge self - consistency in periodically focused beam distributions makes it plausible that many near - edge particles can move sufficiently outside the beam core to partake in the resonance .",
    "consequently , large distortions in the beam phase - space and large rms emittance growth can result .",
    "stability thresholds based on this resonance picture are in rough agreement with experimental measurements and simulations .",
    "analogous transport limits to the ones studied here will occur in other periodic focusing channels .",
    "generally , unstable parameters will differ due to different scaling of matched beam envelope flutter .",
    "envelope mismatch also increases driving envelope excursions and introduces additional frequencies  likely reducing the region of stable transport .",
