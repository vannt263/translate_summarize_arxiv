    "the problem of finding the ground state of a two - dimensional triangular lattice antiferromagnet  ( tlam ) is of particular interest due to the possibility of finding solutions with unconventional magnetic order , which are influenced significantly both by frustration and by zero - point fluctuations .",
    "as the magnetic exchange interactions between the ions located on a regular two - dimensional triangular lattice are frustrated , a usual neel - type ground state with anti - parallel alignment of the nearest neighbour moments is hindered by the geometry . in the molecular field approximation",
    ", the minimum of energy is reached for a planar spin configuration with the magnetisation of the three sublattices arranged at 120@xmath4 to one other .",
    "such a spin configuration has been found in numerous compounds with a stacked triangular lattice @xcite , regardless of the dimensionality of the magnetic interactions , which can have a pronounced 1d or 2d character .",
    "a very recent report suggests that instead of a long range structure , a spin - liquid state with a relatively short correlation length may be stabilised in some compounds @xcite .    in an applied magnetic field ,",
    "the mean - field ground state of the 2d triangular antiferromagnet  remains highly degenerate , as the overall energy is defined only by the total spin of the three sublattices , while there is an infinitely large number of different states with the same total spin @xcite .",
    "indeed , any possible value of the total spin can be represented as an umbrella - type structure of equally tilted magnetic moments with identical transverse components , or , alternatively , as a variety of both planar and nonplanar structures with variable angles between the magnetic moments and the direction of the field .",
    "this degeneracy is removed by thermal and quantum fluctuations , which select a symmetric planar structure for a purely isotropic ( heisenberg ) case , for an easy - axis type of anisotropy and also for an easy - plane type of anisotropy if the field is applied in the basal plane @xcite .",
    "if the field is applied perpendicular to the easy - plane , the mean - field approach yields an umbrella - type structure , which is non - degenerate with respect to the mutual orientation of magnetic moments . for the planar structures , fluctuation analysis reveals a characteristic feature of the magnetisation curve @xmath5 .",
    "namely , a collinear magnetic structure with nearly one third of the saturation magnetisation ( @xmath6 ) that is stabilised by the fluctuations in the vicinity of the field @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the saturation field .",
    "the stabilisation of this structure is seen as a plateau on the @xmath5 curve , while in the molecular field approximation the magnetisation curve has a continuous derivative .",
    "this structure is referred to as  two spins up , one down \" or uud .",
    "apart from this , tlams are distinguished from conventional collinear ferro and antiferromagnets by the fact that for some phases , called _ chiral _ phases , there are still two ways to arrange the rest of the structure even when the direction of the spin on a particular apex of the triangle is fixed . fig .",
    "[ chir ] shows two magnetic structures , a and b , which share the alignment of the spin in the position a and possess the same exchange energy , but differ by the direction of rotation of the spins when translated to the nearest apex .",
    "chiral degeneracy influences considerably the nature of the phase transition to an ordered state @xcite . within a magnetic @xmath1 phase diagram for a single tlam , both chiral and nonchiral structures are possible ,",
    "therefore the second order phase transitions with different critical indices should be expected for the different values of an applied magnetic field .",
    "an especially interesting point to consider is a transition from a paramagnetic phase to a uud structure occurring in a constant field on lowering the temperature .",
    "this is a transition into a collinear phase with an uncompensated magnetic moment .",
    "such structures with uncompensated magnetic moment are characteristic of ferrimagnets , therefore for a description of this collinear phase on a triangular lattice a ferrimagnetic order parameter is used @xcite . in ordinary ferrimagnets , however , the magnetic ions are located on non - equivalent crystallographic positions , which leads to the appearance of non - equivalent magnetic sublattices and an uncompensated moment . in these conventional ferrimagnets",
    "an ordering transition in an applied magnetic field is absent , as an induced moment exists at all temperatures . in the case of a 2d tlam , however , all the magnetic ions are in equivalent positions , while the ordering into a uud structure is accompanied by a tripling of the unit cell area , which causes a transition of a specific type @xcite .",
    "the majority of tlams have quasi one - dimensional character .",

    ", we show that the observed change - over in the temperature dependence of the specific heat from the low - temperature @xmath3 law to the intermediate temperature @xmath2 law ( as described in section [ subsec_magnet ] ) is also indicative of the two - dimensional disposition of this magnetic system .",
    "the temperature dependence of an antiferromagnet  for @xmath84 is usually determined by thermally activated magnons .",
    "the spectrum of acoustic magnons in antiferromagnetic @xmath0  consists of one gapless mode and two modes with a gap of 90  ghz ( 4.5  k).@xcite at such low temperatures , the variation of the gap s magnitude should be small , as the order parameter for @xmath84 is reduced by not more than 30% . the main contribution to",
    "the specific heat in this temperature region comes from the magnons of the gapless branch . at the lowest temperature the wave - numbers of the thermal magnons",
    "are small and lie far away from the brillouin zone boundary",
    ". therefore one can expect for @xmath30 a typical three - dimensional behaviour , that is @xmath85 .",
    "due to a large difference between the inter- and the intra - layer exchange interactions , the magnon dispersion relation is highly anisotropic  the magnons propagating along the @xmath14-axis are less dispersive than those with a wave - vector confined to the triangular plane .",
    "consequently , at a certain temperature , the energy of the thermal magnons travelling along the @xmath14-axis reaches its maximum value , while the size of the @xmath86-space region corresponding to magnons with @xmath87 will continue to expand . for these temperatures one can expect a typical two - dimensional behaviour , that is @xmath88",
    "inevitably , the change - over from a cubic to a quadratic law should occur at the temperature dependent on interlayer exchange energy , or , more precisely , on the maximum energy of the @xmath89 magnons of the lowest gapless branch .",
    "this is the energy of the lowest",
    " exchange \"-",
    "mode of the antiferromagnetic resonance spectrum . according to ref . , the gap of the lowest exchange mode is about 30  ghz ( 1.5 k ) , which agrees well with the observed crossover temperature .",
    "thus the 2d-3d crossover in the temperature dependence of specific heat confirms the domination of two - dimensional features in the thermodynamic behaviour of @xmath0 .",
    "given the two - dimensional nature of the magnetic properties of @xmath0 , let us compare the observed critical behaviour with the results of the classical monte carlo simulations @xcite performed for the 2d xy - model .",
    "the neel temperature in this simulation is defined as @xmath90 . using the value of @xmath91  k determined from the susceptibility and saturation magnetisation measurements @xcite ,",
    "the predicted ordering temperature is @xmath92  k , which is in a good agreement with the value of @xmath93  k determined experimentally .",
    "the ordering temperature for the 2d heisenberg antiferromagnet  on a triangular lattice , on the other hand , is defined as @xmath94 , @xcite which unexpectedly gives less satisfactory agreement with the experimental @xmath28 .",

[ pdlandau ] shows the comparison between the temperature dependence of the specific heat measured experimentally and obtained from the monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "it also shows a comparison of the phase boundary positions from the experimental @xmath1 diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ phasediagr ] ) and the simulations @xcite for @xmath98 . for the theoretical curve ,",
    "the value of the exchange parameter quoted above has been used .",
    "the overall agreement is satisfactory , as the two phase diagrams have very similar shapes , apart from the low - field region . for low fields ,",
    "however , the distinction is fundamental : the theoretical model predicts a phase transition from paramagnetic to chiral structures only through a collinear phase , while experimentally a single phase transition is observed for all fields below 2  t.    the measured @xmath30 and @xmath60 curves allow one to determine the specific heat and the order parameter critical indices for the phase transition into the collinear phase .",
    "corresponding experimental data are presented in figs .",
    "[ orderparameter ] and [ c5 t ] .",
    "the experimentally determined indices are @xmath99 for the specific heat and @xmath100 for the order parameter .",
    "they agree well with @xmath101 and @xmath102 obtained from the simulations @xcite .",
    "t applied in the easy - plane of @xmath0 .",
    "the inset shows @xmath103 curve in the vicinity of the phase transition on a log - log scale . ]",
    "it can be concluded then that the ordering temperature , the magnetic phase diagram and the critical indices of the specific heat and the order parameter demonstrate a satisfactory quantitative agreement with the 2d xy - model predictions for zero field and also for regions of the field ( @xmath104 ) where the collinear phase is stable .",
    "most likely this agreement can be explained by the large value of the energy gap for the magnon branch , which corresponds to a deviation of the spins out of the basal plane .",
    "this gap has been estimated as 90 ghz ( or 4.5 k ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , for all the magnetically ordered phases , the thermodynamic properties are defined by gapless and low - energy magnons , corresponding to spin fluctuations within the easy plane .",
    "this , in turn , justifies the applicability of the xy model .",
    "the easy - plane type of magnetic anisotropy in @xmath0  is confirmed by the observation of the magnetisation plateau around @xmath17 for the magnetic field applied in the @xmath106 plane and by the linear rise of the @xmath5 curves for the field parallel to the @xmath14-axis . for an easy - plane anisotropy , the magnetic moment of the system",
    "is generated for @xmath107 by the even tilts of all the subblattices in an umbrella - like structure towards the field ( see fig . [ pdoupl ] ) .",
    "for such a system , the application of an external magnetic field should result in a decrease of the ordering temperature .",
    "moreover , in the vicinity of @xmath108 , the reduction should be proportional to the square of the field , similarly to an ordinary two - sublattice antiferromagnet@xcite . the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ pdoupl ] shows such a dependence , @xmath109 , with @xmath110  t and @xmath111  k. for the case of the uniformly tilted spins described here , splitting in the nmr spectra should be absent , but it is observed .",
    "the origin of this small but clearly visible splitting remains unknown at the present time .",
    "to summarise , we have performed a systematic and comprehensive study of the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of the quasi two - dimensional  tlam @xmath0 , as well as measurements of the magnetic order parameter for this compound .",
    "a crossover from a @xmath2 law to a @xmath3 law is observed for the temperature dependence of the specific heat at low temperatures .",
    "the phase diagram and critical properties demonstrate a surprisingly good quantitative agreement with the predictions for the xy - model despite the fact that the easy - plane anisotropy in @xmath0  does not dominate the main exchange interaction .",
