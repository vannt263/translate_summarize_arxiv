    "entanglement between the intense signal and idler beams generated by an above - threshold opo can be physically understood as a consequence of energy conservation in the parametric process .",
    "on one hand , pump photons are converted into pairs of signal and idler photons , leading to strong intensity correlations ; on the other hand , the sum of frequencies of signal and idler photons is fixed to the value of pump frequency , leading to phase anti - correlations .",
    "the difficulty of measuring phase fluctuations was largely responsible for the long time between the prediction and the first observation of entanglement in the above - threshold opo .",

    "this strange behavior , also observed by other groups  @xcite , is not predicted by the standard linearized opo theory , for a shot noise limited pump beam . according to this model",

    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin by describing the linearized model for the opo and its predictions for a shot noise limited pump beam .",
    "this model includes losses and also allows for nonvanishing detunings of pump , signal , and idler modes with respect to the opo cavity .",
    "we then present a full - quantum treatment , neglecting losses and for zero detunings . even after eliminating the linearization approximation",
    ", the theory does not predict the observed excess noise .",
    "the experiment is described next , and we present measurements of sum and difference of quadratures fluctuations , as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "the excess noise in the phase sum can be related to pump noise generated inside the opo cavity , as we will see .",
    "we finally present our currently best measurement of two - color squeezed - state entanglement .",
    "we conclude by mentioning applications of this entanglement in quantum information .",
    "the optical parametric oscillator consists of three modes of the electromagnetic field coupled by a nonlinear crystal , which is held inside an optical cavity .",
    "the opo is driven by an incident pump field at frequency @xmath16 . following the usual terminology , the downconverted fields are called signal and idler , of frequencies @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where , by energy conservation , @xmath19 .",
    "we will treat here the case of a cavity which is triply resonant for @xmath20 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "each field is damped via the cavity output mirror , thereby interacting with reservoir fields .",
    "the effective second - order nonlinearity of the crystal is represented by the constant @xmath21 .",
    "reid and drummond investigated the correlations in the nondegenerate opo ( nopo ) both above  @xcite and below threshold  @xcite . in the above threshold case , they studied the effects of phase diffusion in the signal and idler modes , beginning with the positive p - representation equations of motion for the interacting fields  @xcite . changing to intensity and phase variables",
    ", they were able to show that output quadratures could be chosen which exhibited fluctuations below the coherent state level and also einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) type correlations . in the below threshold case , a standard linearized calculation was sufficient to obtain similar correlations . in the limit of a rapidly decaying pump mode , kheruntsyan and petrosyan",
    "were able to calculate exactly the steady - state wigner function for the nopo , showing clearly the threshold behavior and the phase diffusion above this level of pumping  @xcite .",
    "we begin by describing the linearized model , and then proceed to calculate noise spectra beyond linearization .",
    "the equations describing the evolution of signal , idler , and pump amplitudes , @xmath22 , inside the triply resonant opo cavity are given below  @xcite .",
    "they are obtained by writing the density operator equation of motion in the wigner representation , and then searching for a set of equivalent langevin equations .",

    "the terms @xmath35 and @xmath36 are vacuum fluctuations associated to the losses from the mirrors transmissions and from spurious sources , respectively . in the case of the intracavity pump mode , the fluctuations that come from the mirror transmission are due to the quantum fluctuations of the input pump laser beam , @xmath37 .",

    "we may then separate the fluctuating part in real and imaginary contributions in order to obtain the equations of evolution for the quadratures of the fields . defining @xmath43 and @xmath44 as the normalized sum / subtraction of signal and idler amplitude and phase quadratures",
    ", we write the above equations in terms of the epr variables :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the ratio between the intracavity amplitudes of downconverted and pump fields .",
    "noise spectra of the transmitted fields are calculated by solving the above equations in fourier space .",

    "these fluctuations do not depend on pump power , and are in a minimum uncertainty state , @xmath54 , if @xmath55 .    on the other hand ,",

    "these behaviors change in the presence of excess noise in the pump .",
    "in this case , both @xmath56 and @xmath57 increase from their values at threshold .",
    "in particular , @xmath56 goes from squeezing to excess noise .",
    "the point where it crosses the shot noise value solely depends on the amount of excess phase noise present in the pump beam .",
    "for this reason , it was necessary to filter the pump field in the experiment , in order to observe entanglement .",
    "we present here a comparison between the linearized approach to the quantum noise in the opo and the numerical integration of the quantum stochastic equations in the positive p - representation",
    ". this will help us to eliminate the linearization procedure as the reason for the discrepancy between the theoretical prediction of squeezing and the experimentally observed excess phase noise for @xmath58 .",
    "we shall follow the procedure used in ref .",
    "@xcite although exact heisenberg equations of motion can be found for this system , it is , at the very least , extremely difficult to solve nonlinear operator equations .",
    "we therefore develop stochastic equations of motion in the positive p - representation , which in principle give access to any normally - ordered operator expectation values we may wish to calculate . to find the appropriate equations , we proceed via the master and fokker - planck equations . using the standard techniques for elimination of the baths  @xcite",

    "we measured the laser phase noise by reflecting the beam off an empty cavity , in the same way we measure phase noise of the downconverted beams .",
    "the phase noise equals the intensity noise , except at a frequency of 12  mhz , where there is very big phase noise , owing to a frequency modulation inside the diabolo laser , for stabilization purposes .",
