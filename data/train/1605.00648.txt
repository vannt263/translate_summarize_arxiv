    "the role played by magnetic fields during star formation within gmcs is therefore a complicated but important topic .",
    "observationally , the magnetic field strength along the line of sight can be directly measured via zeeman splitting of molecular lines , but it is hard to detect . in dense star - forming clouds , the polarized thermal emission from dust grains at infrared and sub - millimeter wavelengths has been shown to be a reliable technique of studying the projected magnetic field direction on the plane of sky ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "theoretically , magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations offer an approach to calibrate the interpretation of polarimetric patterns . in infrared and sub - millimeter wavelengths ,",
    "simulated polarized emission can be directly calculated by integrating the radiative transfer equations for the stokes parameters along the line of sight , with assumptions of grain properties and their alignment efficiencies @xcite .",
    "synthetic polarimetric maps can be produced from the three - dimensional ( 3d ) gas density and magnetic field information known at every voxel .",
    "most theoretical studies have focused on inferring the magnetic field strength from the distribution of polarization angles @xcite , while others have concentrated on providing insight into the polarization@xmath2intensity correlation ( @xcite , also see section  [ sec : pn ] ) .    in numerical studies of star formation , overdense fragments within gmcs are often formed due to in - cloud shocks and colliding gas flows from cloud - scale turbulence @xcite .",

    "it is noteworthy that , though turbulence can create a combination of shearing , diverging , and converging effects at all physical scales , it is those regions with large - scale convergent flows that will compress gas significantly and strongly alter the gravitational stability in the cloud @xcite .",

    "here , motivated by @xcite , we analyze the prestellar core - forming simulations from by computing the hro , and investigate the physics controlling hro shape .",
    "we found that the angle between the density gradient and the magnetic field is highly correlated with the significance of self - gravity in dense structures . specifically , the hro changes shape when gravity is strong enough to accelerate the gas to a super - alfvnic speed .",
    "in addition , there are similar trends in the shape of hros determined from the 2d projected polarization maps , suggesting that polarization observations can be a tool to directly constrain the magnetic field morphology and strength .",

    "we discuss the field - density relationship in section  [ sec : bn ] . in section  [ sec : pvsn ] , we extend our analysis to hros in projected 2d map , where we argue that the threshold value for a power - law polarization@xmath2column density relation is the key for different hro shapes .",

    "the simulations we adopted are described in and and briefly summarized here .",
    "these fully 3d mhd simulations , conducted using _ athena _ @xcite , are @xmath3  pc - wide boxes , where plane - parallel converging flows collide head - to - head , creating a locally flat , dense layer in the post - shock region .",
    "this setup is similar to the situation when large - scale ( @xmath4  pc ) turbulent flows in the molecular cloud locally collide , and by adopting a box size much smaller than the driven scale of the turbulent flow , the convergent flow can be considered as plane - parallel .",
    "seeded by a randomly perturbed velocity field with power spectrum @xmath5 , filamentary structures and prestellar cores grow within the shocked layer . by conducting the simulation multiple times with different realization of perturbation field ( i.e. sampling different @xmath6-pc regions within the same cloud ) , one can collect enough information for statistical analysis . the cloud magnetic field in the pre - shock region is initially set to be oblique with respect to the shock .",
    "in the post - shock region , the field lines become roughly parallel to the dense layer due to shock compression ( see figure  3 - 5 in ) . all models",

    ".    the hro shape can provide important information of the magnetic field direction relative to the gas structure ; a concave hro means that the magnetic field is preferentially aligned perpendicular ( @xmath60 or @xmath61 ) to the density gradient , or parallel to the gas structure . on the other hand ,",
    "a convex hro indicates the magnetic field is perpendicular to the elongation direction of gas clumps .",

    "we aim to find the transition density where the hro changes shape and the physical interpretation of this density .",
    "we discuss the details in the following sections . also note that we chose to normalize the hros so that the sum of the heights of all bars in each distribution is unity , which makes our study comparable with @xcite because the number of points in each segmentation is factored out by this normalization method .      -@xmath44 plane , and the observer is viewing along the @xmath62 direction .",

    "the integrated polarization angle @xmath54 has the same convention as @xmath64 . ]",
    "the procedure we use to obtain the stokes parameters is based on previous work @xcite wherein the relative stokes parameters are calculated , which are functions only of the density @xmath66 and magnetic field structure :    @xmath67    [ poldef ]    here , @xmath63 is the inclination angle of the local magnetic field relative to the plane of the sky , and @xmath64 is the position angle of the magnetic field on the plane of the sky ( see figure  [ angdef ] ) . using a cartesian coordinate system where the @xmath44-axis corresponds to north in galactic coordinates and where the @xmath45-axis is parallel to the line of sight , we can represent the relative stokes parameters in a more convenient form :    @xmath68    [ poldef2 ]    under assumptions of perfect grain alignment and pure emission from dust grains , m for vela c molecular cloud @xcite , suggesting the radiative environment of the gas is not playing a huge role in this region . from",
    "previously published starlight polarization data in molecular clouds , @xcite also concluded that the magnetic field structure is more important in controlling polarization fraction and dispersion than grain alignment efficiency .",

    "it is possible to extract the relative stokes parameters from observations .",

    "@xmath73    the inferred polarization angle on the plane of sky is given using the four - quadrant inverse tangent ( which returns value in the range of @xmath74 $ ] based on the signs of the two inputs ) ,    @xmath75    the polarization angle @xmath54 is measured clockwise from north , with the same convention as the magnetic field position angle @xmath64 ( see figure  [ angdef ] ) .    to focus our analysis on the compressed region ,",
    "we only consider simulation cells with density @xmath76  @xmath10 in our column density and polarization fraction calculations , unless otherwise noted ( e.g.  figure  [ dcutmap ] ) .",
    "since most polarization observations of molecular clouds trace only dense gas , and the diffuse background has been removed from the observed thermal emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , applying a density limit makes the simulated polarization maps more comparable to observations ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in the ideal mhd limit , gas is strictly coupled to magnetic field .",
    "when gas is compressed by a supersonic , super - alfvnic shock , the magnetic field component perpendicular to the shock flow is amplified as well ( see @xcite and for discussions about oblique mhd shocks ) .",
    "the post - shock region is therefore strongly magnetized .",
    "however , through anisotropic condensation along the magnetic field lines , local dense clumps are able to collect materials without adding more magnetic support . as a result , the magnetic field strength is largely unrelated to the gas density .",
    "this process is shown to be dominant in strongly - magnetized shock - compressed regions , until the dense structures become dense enough to collapse gravitationally ( ) .",
    "self - gravitating gas would therefore show positive correlation between density and magnetic field .",
    "similar behavior of the field@xmath2density relation has been reported in numerical studies of molecular cloud formation .    for simulations with different shock mach numbers in at the time when the most evolved core starts to collapse , we bin the dataset by the log of number density @xmath66 with bin width @xmath77 , and calculate the median value of the magnetic field @xmath78 in each bin .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ bvsd_ma ] ( _ left panel _ ) , where the error bars represent the first and third quartiles ( i.e.  the @xmath79 values of the distribution ) .",
    "the pre - shock and post - shock regions can be easily distinguished by the sharp jump in magnetic field strength near @xmath80  @xmath10 . between @xmath81  @xmath10 ,",
    "the magnetic field strength is roughly unchanged with increasing number density , a feature predicted by the anisotropic condensation model described in .",
    "this also leads to a relatively homogeneous magnetic field direction in the post - shock layer ; figure  [ dcutmap ] ( _ top left _ ) demonstrates the well - ordered magnetic field in 3d at density @xmath82  @xmath10 ( an animation of changing viewing angles is available on the online journal ) .",
    "a more important transition happens at @xmath83  @xmath10 , where the magnetic field becomes strongly correlated with the number density ( roughly as a power - law scaling ; see section  [ sec : bn ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the magnetic field is compressed with the gas in this regime , and the 3d visualization in figure  [ dcutmap ] ( _ top right _ ) illustrates the twisted magnetic field lines around dense clumps ( an animation of changing viewing angles is available on the online journal ) .",
    "in fact , we found that magnetic field morphology changes with density in the simulations .",

    "is the hro of polarization fraction and column density gradient ( _ bottom row _ ) , which we will discuss in detail in section  [ sec : pvsn ] .",
    "] as the gas density increases , both the distributions of position ( @xmath64 ) and inclination angle ( @xmath63 ; see figure  [ angdef ] for definition ) of magnetic field spread to wider ranges , and thus the uniformity of magnetic field decreases .",
    "the change is dramatic for densities larger than the transition value of the @xmath84 curve ; the plane - of - sky magnetic field loses the preferred direction at @xmath85 , and the total magnetic field can no longer be considered roughly parallel to the plane of sky with @xmath86 .",
    "we therefore define the transition density at which the magnetic field and gas density become highly correlated , @xmath87 , as the boundary value of the segmentation when drawing hros . the value of @xmath87 for each model is listed in table  [ sumtable ] . in the right panel of figure  [ bvsd_ma ] we plotted hros corresponding to density segmentations with @xmath88 ( _ blue lines _ ) and @xmath89 ( _ red lines _ ) .",
    "the hro shape clearly changes from concave to convex when density increases from @xmath90 to @xmath91 . to demonstrate that the onset of hro shape change is definitely correlated with @xmath87",
    ", we also included in figure  [ bvsd_ma ] the @xmath41 and @xmath92 values of @xmath93 and the corresponding hros .",
    "there is significant change in hro shape even with small deviations from @xmath87 .",
    "this is further evidence that @xmath87 marks a transition between two different hro shapes .     in volume density segmentations for models m5 ( _ stars _",

    "vertical dashed lines represent @xmath87 defined from figure  [ bvsd_ma ] and are labeled by corresponding marks for each model .",
    "]    in addition , we calculated the hro shape parameter @xmath95 as defined in ( see their equation  ( 4 ) ) : @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 represent the @xmath99 areas under the hro curve at the center ( @xmath100 , or @xmath101 in 2d ) and on the edge ( @xmath102 and @xmath103 , or @xmath104 and @xmath105 in 2d ) , respectively .",
    "a concave hro would have @xmath106 , and a convex hro , @xmath107 .",
    "thus the parameter @xmath95 provides a way to characterize hro shape in a single parameter .",
    "the values of @xmath95 as functions of number density for all three models are plotted in figure  [ bn_zeta ] , as well as the transition densities @xmath87 defined from @xmath84 plots in figure  [ bvsd_ma ] .",
    "the significant change of @xmath95 from positive to negative around @xmath87 is striking , and the threshold density of the @xmath84 relation predicts the transition of hro shape very well .",
    "we discuss the physical reason for the connection between hro shape and @xmath87 in the following section .",
    "as mentioned in previous sections , the self - gravity of magnetized gas can induce gravitational collapse that compresses both the gas and the magnetic field .",
    "the threshold density @xmath87 @xmath2 where the field strength becomes a power law in density , or where the hro shape changes from concave to convex @xmath2 therefore corresponds to the density at which the gas becomes self - gravitating .",
    "however , the gravitational energy can not be determined uniquely , as it depends on where the reference point of the gravitational potential is chosen .",
    "nonetheless , the effect of gravity can be inferred through its dynamical influence on the gas .",
    "we can therefore use the increases in gas kinetic energy and velocity magnitudes to gauge the significance of self - gravity .",
    "figure  [ energy ] compares the thermal ( @xmath108 ) , magnetic ( @xmath109 ) , and kinetic ( @xmath110 ) energy density of the gas ( _ left panel _ ) , as well as the corresponding velocity magnitudes : sound speed @xmath111 , alfvn speed @xmath112 , and gas velocity @xmath113 ( _ right panel _ ) , as functions of density .",
    "it shows that , the kinetic energy first drops from the initial values at the shock front , making the post - shock region dominated by the magnetic pressure so that anisotropic gas flow along the magnetic field is preferred .",
    "the gas velocity therefore decreases with density in this regime because of the lack of energy input , resulting in a relatively unchanged kinetic energy . at a density somewhat below @xmath87 ( _ dashed lines _ ) , @xmath110 starts to rise ( or , in the case of model m20 , the slope of @xmath110 becomes steeper ) ; then the gas transitions from @xmath114 to @xmath115 close to @xmath116 for all three cases .",
    "more importantly , @xmath87 clearly marks the beginning of gravity - induced acceleration in terms of increasing gas velocity with density .",
    "this happens right at the intersection of @xmath113 and @xmath117 , i.e.  at the transition for the gas to become super - alfvnic ( @xmath118 ) from sub - alfvnic ( @xmath119 ) .     as a function of density for models m5 ( _ stars _ ) , m10 ( _ triangles _ ) , and m20 ( _ filled circles _ ) .",
    "also plotted are the boundary values for hro segmentation , @xmath87 , measured from the @xmath84 relation in figure  [ bvsd_ma ] ( _ dashed lines with corresponding marker _ ) .",
    "note that model m20 is the only one that stays super - alfvnic even at density scales of dense cores ( @xmath120  @xmath10 ) . ]",
    "we can also directly compare @xmath113 and @xmath117 , or the relative importance of kinetic energy and magnetic energy , by measuring the alfvn mach number : @xmath121 figure  [ ma ] shows the behavior of @xmath38 in each model as a function of gas density .",
    "the plot demonstrates a clear transition from the super - alfvnic ( @xmath122 ) pre - shock flow to the sub - alfvnic ( @xmath123 ) post - shock layer , within which overdense regions gradually acquire kinetic energy by falling into local gravitational potential wells , get denser , and become super - alfvnic at @xmath124 ( _ dashed lines _ ) .",
    "also illustrates the difficulty with using @xmath38 as the segmentation criterion of hro in simulations like ours where the behavior of @xmath38 in different regimes ( pre - shock , post - shock ; non - self - gravitating , self - gravitating ) is non - monotonic , with voxels in different evolutionary stages potentially sharing the same values of @xmath38 . ]",
    "thus @xmath87 represents a characteristic value for gravity - induced alfvnic transition in a strongly magnetized cloud : gas dynamics at @xmath88 is constrained by magnetic pressure , while at @xmath89 the gas kinetic energy ( augmented by gravity ) dominates .",
    "note that there may be other reasons for the alfvn mach number @xmath38 to increase with increasing density .",
    "for example , @xcite found a similar trend in non - self - gravitating , globally sub - alfvnic clouds , most likely because the mass density increases faster than the magnetic energy density for condensation along field lines , causing the alfvn speed @xmath117 to drop with density .",
    "this drop is also seen in our model m20 ( see figure  [ energy ] ) . in this case , the drop in alfvn speed @xmath117 contributes to the increase in @xmath38 . for the other two cases ( m5 and m10 ) , @xmath117 increases with density beyond the transition density @xmath87 , which means that the increase in @xmath38 must come entirely from the increase in flow speed . in other words ,",
    "the flow speed is increased so much that the alfvn mach number increases with density despite the increase in alfvn speed . gravitational contraction naturally explains both the increase in flow speed and the increase in alfvn speed because it causes condensation across field lines , which tends to increase the magnetic energy density faster than the mass density .",
    "these results provide a natural explanation for why the magnetic field starts to correlate positively with density at @xmath89 : the magnetic pressure in this density regime is no longer strong enough to resist condensation across the field lines . on the other hand , sub - alfvnic , anisotropic flow along the magnetic field lines",
    "is favored at @xmath88 , and it is difficult for subregions to contract perpendicular to the field lines in this regime . as a result , gas structures will gradually evolve to become elongated roughly perpendicular to the magnetic field direction , especially under the influence of self - gravity ( see ) .",
    "this morphology is reflected in the convex hro at @xmath89 when cross - field line contraction is just able to begin . at @xmath88 ,",
    "the hro remains concave because it continues to be dominated by the low - density striations that are preferentially aligned with the field lines ( see figure  [ dcutmap ] , _ top left _ ) .",
    "the transformation of hro shape is therefore directly related to the gravity - driven alfvnic transition at the threshold density @xmath87 .",
    "figure  [ bvsd_ma ] ( _ left panel _ ) indicates that the high - density gas is self - gravitating and thus the magnetic flux is compressed along with the gas , resulting in a strong correlation between magnetic field strength @xmath78 and gas number density @xmath66 that can be fitted by a power - law scaling @xmath26 .",
    "numerous studies , both observational and theoretical , have been conducted to determine the value of @xmath25 in this so - called field@xmath2density relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the fitted @xmath25 values are listed in table  [ sumtable ] .",
    "our @xmath25 value varies from @xmath125 to @xmath126 between models , which is consistent with the observed @xmath127 value in dense gas @xcite .",
    "our result suggests a strong dependence of @xmath25 on the physical conditions of the simulations ; models with stronger inflows ( which create post - shock regions with a lower plasma @xmath16 value and higher velocity perturbation ; see table  [ sumtable ] ) have a weaker @xmath84 dependence .    the dependence of @xmath25 on turbulent level that we found is qualitatively similar to the numerical results reported in @xcite .",
    "though the range of density covered in @xcite is different from this study , the positive correlation between magnetic field and density at high densities is clear .",
    "also , for the strongly magnetized regime ( their @xmath128 models ) , a weaker supersonic turbulence tends to produce a stronger @xmath84 correlation ( see their figures 18 and 19 ) , similar to what we found .",
    "in addition , a recent study by @xcite adopted @xmath129 as the initial turbulent strength and found @xmath130 and @xmath131 for models with @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath25 value we found in our model m10 ( which has @xmath134 ) , @xmath135 , is in good agreement with their results .",
    "this also indicates a possible trend of lower @xmath25 values in strongly magnetized ( small @xmath16 ) media . to conclude , the @xmath84 scaling may not be universal , with the exponent @xmath25 affected by the magnetic and kinematic properties of the molecular cloud",
    "in 3d data , there is a drastic change in the hro shape as the gas transitions from a sub - alfvnic state to a super - aflvnic state through gravitational acceleration , at the threshold density @xmath87 in the magnetic field@xmath2density relation .",
    "however , neither the total magnetic field strength nor the volume density is easily measurable observationally . what can be measured more easily are the column density along the line of sight , from integrated thermal continuum or molecular line emission , and polarized dust emission , which can provide information of the magnetic field direction projected on the plane of sky ( see section  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "we therefore investigated the polarization fraction @xmath53 as a function of column density @xmath49 in the 2d projected map .",
    "the polarization fraction is calculated based on the method discussed in section  [ sec : pol ] , and we chose @xmath137 as the maximum polarization fraction to be comparable with observational results ( see discussions and references in section  [ sec : intro ] ) . would simply re - normalize the simulated polarization level , and do not change any of our conclusions . ] for simplicity , we chose to observe the post - shock layer face - on so that the mean magnetic field direction is on the plane of sky .",
    "the column density is thus @xmath138 , where @xmath45 is the inflow direction ( also see figure  [ angdef ] for the convention of coordinate system ) .",
    "we binned all pixels in the projected map by @xmath139 with bin width @xmath77 , and calculated the median and @xmath79 values of the polarization fraction @xmath53 .",
    "figure  [ pvsn_ma ] ( _ left panel _ ) plots the @xmath140 relation from models m5 , m10 and m20 ; in general , the polarization fraction appears to decrease with column density monotonically for lower @xmath49 , then becomes relatively random after a sharp drop or rise .",
    "this can be understood as increasing disorder in magnetic field structure with column density , especially when the self - gravity of the gas takes over the control .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , gravitational collapse will likely induce isotropic amplification of magnetic field .",
    "this may lead to large variations in the the inclination angle of the magnetic field with respect to the plane of sky which , together with the relatively small number of high column density cells , leads to large fluctuations in polarization fraction at the high @xmath49 end .",
    "the column density segmentation for hros of 2d projected maps , @xmath136 , is therefore defined as the column density where @xmath53 shows a sharp change .",
    "this value is marked by dashed line for each model in figure  [ pvsn_ma ] ( _ left panel _ ) , and the corresponding hros are shown in figure  [ pvsn_ma ] ( _ right panel _ ) .",
    "the change of hro shape for column density segmentation below or above @xmath136 is evident ; hros at lower column densities are concave , then become relatively flat or convex when @xmath141 . also plotted in figure  [ pvsn_ma ] is the hros with @xmath142 , the average column density of the projected map ( _ dotted lines in the left panel _ ) .",
    "since the transition for gas structures to become self - gravitating is a continuous process , the concave hros with @xmath143 simply provide a reference point that this transition must happen within column density range @xmath144 .",
    "segmented by column density for m5 ( _ stars _ ) , m10 ( _ triangles _ ) , and m20 ( _ filled circles _ ) ; @xmath94 suggests the transition of hro shape from concave to convex .",
    "vertical dashed lines represent @xmath136 defined from figure  [ pvsn_ma ] and are labeled by corresponding markers for each model . ]",
    "the hro shape parameter @xmath95 , defined in equation  ( [ zetadef ] ) , for different column density segmentations is plotted in figure  [ pvsn_zeta ] .",
    "we again compared the @xmath136 values defined from figure  [ pvsn_ma ] ( _ dashed lines with corresponding markers _ ) with the column densities where @xmath145 .",
    "similar to the 3d case , the threshold value identified from @xmath140 relation provides good prediction for @xmath146 .",
    "note that the change of hro shape in the 2d projected map is directly related to the gas volume density in the 3d space .",
    "figure  [ dcutmap ] ( _ bottom row _ ) shows the hro between the projected column density gradient from simulation cells with different number densities and the integrated polarization direction .",
    "this is analogous to observing the cloud with various molecule tracers to probe gas content within different density ranges , and using continuum emission to collect polarization information ( see figure  [ dcutmap ] , _ fourth row _ ) .",
    "the hro changes from central - peaked in @xmath147 ( _ left two panels _ ) to relatively flat in @xmath89 ( _ right panel _ ) , which suggests that in principle one can constrain the threshold density @xmath87 by conducting observations toward the same region with molecular lines that trace different density regimes and comparing the shape of hro between the polarization direction from continuum and column density distributions from different density tracers .",
    "furthermore , from figure  [ energy ] we know that @xmath148 at @xmath116 , and @xmath110 can be estimated by measuring the rms velocity from molecular line emission . therefore , our results suggest that one can in principle obtain the value of @xmath109 , or the total magnetic field strength , at density @xmath149 .",
    "since @xmath149 is related to self - gravitating gas that forms prestellar / protostellar cores , the magnetic field strength in this regime is extremely important to star formation studies .",
    "we will postpone a more detailed discussion of this application to a follow - up paper ( king  et al .",

    "several observations have confirmed a negative correlation between the polarization fraction and column density , in the form @xmath29 or @xmath150 with @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the integrated intensity . instead of @xmath153 . also , while most of the studies chose to fit the entire @xmath140 or @xmath154 distribution , applied fits to the upper envelope of the distribution . ]",
    "though there are many factors that might affect the polarization degree in observations like imperfect grain alignment @xcite and dust scattering @xcite , the calculated polarization fraction from our simulations is not affected by those processes .",
    "it captures the intrinsic @xmath140 correlation produced by the magnetic field geometry before it is modified by other , additional , processes .    for the @xmath140 relation at",
    "column densities lower than the threshold value @xmath136 , we fitted the curve in the form @xmath29 ( _ blue dotted lines _ in figure  [ pvsn_ma ] , _ left panel _ ) and obtained the power - law index @xmath155 ( see table  [ sumtable ] ) .",
    "the correlation between @xmath53 and @xmath49 is highly dependent on the environment .",
    "we note that our results are consistent with those discussed by @xcite , who found @xmath156 in models with supersnoic and sub - alfvnic flows , which is comparable to the post - shock environment in our simulations ( see table  [ sumtable ] ) .",
    "though the simulation setup in @xcite is different from what we adopted in this study , the general behavior of mhd gas dynamics is similar in the way that polarization fraction decreases with increasing randomness of the magnetic field , which is induced by compressive gas flows that also enhance column density .",
    "in previous sections we have shown that the magnetic field morphology changes significantly during the gravity - induced alfvnic transition , and the observed polarization level varies accordingly , which can be utilized to indicate the magnetic field strength . here , in order to better understand the relation between magnetic field morphology and resulting polarization fraction , we provide a quantitative analysis of what causes the variation of polarization fraction in star - forming gmcs .      from equation  ( [ poldef ] ) , the polarization fraction @xmath53 and angle @xmath54 are affected by the inclination angle @xmath63 of the magnetic field with respect to the plane of sky , and the dispersion of the plane - of - sky component of the magnetic field ( @xmath65 ) along the line of sight . in extreme cases , @xmath157 is simply the density - weighted mean of the position angle @xmath64 of @xmath65 along the line of sight , and if the plane - of - sky magnetic field is uniform ( constant @xmath64 ) along the line of sight , @xmath158 .",
    "any increase in @xmath63 or in the dispersion level of @xmath64 along the line of sight would result in a lower polarization fraction . here",
    "we discuss a mathematical analysis to quantify these two effects .",
    "the position angle @xmath64 is defined as the angle ( clockwise ) between @xmath159 and @xmath65 in a convention that @xmath160 ( see figure  [ angdef ] ) .",
    "we thus define the dispersion of the direction of @xmath65 along the line - of - sight ( @xmath161 ) as the density - weighted standard deviation of @xmath64 along @xmath161 : @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the density - weighted mean of @xmath64 along the line of sight : @xmath164 the parameter @xmath165 is a measurement of the level of tangledness of the plane - of - sky magnetic field along the line of sight .",
    "we can also calculate the density - weighted average inclination angle with respect to the sky as @xmath166 and @xmath167 this is roughly the average inclination angle of the magnetic field with respect to the plane of sky along the line of sight .",
    "note that @xmath168 .",
    "these two parameters , @xmath165 and @xmath169 , can be considered as two independent factors controlling the simulated polarization fraction at each pixel of the 2d projected map .",
    "the scatter plots of @xmath170 and @xmath165 from the three simulation models considered in this study are shown in figure  [ polarization ] ( _ left panel _ ) .",
    "these plots are color - coded by the polarization fraction ; the dependence of @xmath53 on both @xmath165 and @xmath170 is clear .",
    "also , the distribution of the polarization fraction ( shown in color ) is very similar across the three models .",
    "this demonstrates that @xmath165 and @xmath169 are good indicators of the polarization fraction .",
    "the most striking feature of these plots is that the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin of @xmath165 and @xmath170 seems to be a good fit for every single value of @xmath53 ; i.e.  the distribution of @xmath170 vs. @xmath165 at a given value of @xmath53 can be roughly described by @xmath171 , where @xmath172 and @xmath173 are constant coefficients that only depend on @xmath53 .",
    "however , we remind the readers that , with the real value of @xmath70 unknown , the polarization fraction derived in this study is only an approximation .",
    "we therefore focus not on making quantitative predictions but instead on understanding physically the behavior of the polarization fraction .",
    "figure  [ polarization ] ( _ left panel _ ) suggests that the tangledness and inclination are almost equally important on determining the polarization fraction . to investigate their effects",
    "separately , we plotted the polarization fraction as a function of @xmath169 in figure  [ polarization ] ( _ right panel _ ) , color - coded by normalized @xmath165 ( @xmath174 in each model ) .",
    "one prominent feature among all three models is that @xmath175 ( where @xmath176 is the maximum value of @xmath53 measured in each model ) , a relation that can be proved mathematically ( see appendix  [ gammader ] ) .    more importantly , in figure  [ polarization ] ( _ right panel _ ) all points along the upper - boundary line @xmath177 ( _ dashed lines _ ) have normalized @xmath178 , and @xmath165 increases away from the line .",
    "the color distribution suggests that at each point on the plane of sky , the averaged inclination angle of the magnetic field along the line of sight first gives the upper limit of the value @xmath53 , then the tangledness of @xmath65 along the line of sight determines how far away from this maximum value the polarization fraction is .",
    "note that a similar analysis has been done by , who also found the proportionality of the envelope of @xmath53 with @xmath169 ( see their figure  21 ) . though the range of gas density in their simulations is not wide enough to cover the self - gravitating regime where @xmath179 dramatically increases ( smallest @xmath169 values ) , by observing the simulation box at different viewing angles ( denoted as @xmath28 in their work ) they were able to find the similar dependence of @xmath53 on @xmath169 as illustrated in figure  [ polarization ] ( _ right panel _ ) . also , their equation  ( 9 ) can be adopted to give the upper - boundary line @xmath177 considering the viewing angle is approximately the inclination angle of the magnetic field in the case that @xmath180 ( also see their figure  16 ) .",
    "we have already seen that polarization fraction generally decreases with increasing column density ( see section  [ sec : pvsn ] and figure  [ pvsn_ma ] ) . to understand how polarization fraction is related to structure evolution and gas dynamics in the cloud , we selected regions from the projected map with different mean column densities @xmath181 , and plotted the relations between @xmath53 , @xmath165 , and @xmath170 as in figure  [ polarization ] within these regions . figures  [ regionsm5 ] to [ regionsm20 ] are results from model m5 , m10 , and m20 , respectively . for each model , in addition to the whole map ( _ top row _ ) , we picked a core - forming region ( high @xmath181 ; _ second row _ ) , a filamentary region ( intermediate @xmath181 ; _ third row _ ) , and a region with no prominent structures ( background / low @xmath181 ; _ bottom row _ ) .",
    "in each figure , we showed the column density map with polarization segments of the region we selected ( _ left _ ) , the @xmath182 scatter plot color - coded by @xmath53 ( _ middle _ ) , and the @xmath183 relation color - coded by normalized @xmath165 ( _ right _ ) .",
    "for all three models , the core - forming regions have the largest scatter ranges of @xmath165 and @xmath170 . as the mean column density decreases , both @xmath165 and @xmath170 decrease .",
    "however , the scatter range of @xmath165 shrinks much faster than @xmath170 ( see the middle columns of figures  [ regionsm5 ] to [ regionsm20 ] ) ; also , in the less dense regions , points are preferentially distributed along the @xmath184 lines ( figures  [ regionsm5 ] to [ regionsm20 ] , _ right _ ) .",
    "this implies that in the least dense regions which resemble the background environment of the cloud , the variation of @xmath53 is mainly induced by the inclination of magnetic field with respect to the plane of sky .",
    "it is not until the formation of dense clumps ( which may be self - gravitating ) that the tangledness of plane - of - sky magnetic field starts to set in and further reduces the polarization fraction .",
    "combined with the anisotropic condensation model described in and , our results suggest a three - stage development process of the magnetic field during the evolution of star - forming regions in molecular clouds .",
    "first , the initial magnetic field in the diffuse cloud ( @xmath185 g ) is amplified by a large - scale shock compression . in the post - shock layer where the magnetic field is strong and",
    "well ordered , materials preferably flow along the field lines to form filamentary structures , which leaves @xmath65 unchanged but may increase @xmath186 as well as the inclination angle @xmath63 .",
    "after dense clumps and/or prestellar cores gathered enough mass and become self - gravitating , the contraction / collapse induced by self - gravity is more isotropic .",
    "the magnetic field is thus amplified again ( @xmath187 g ) , which leads to higher levels of tangledness in @xmath65 and lower values of @xmath53 .",
    "note that the evolution of magnetic field can also explain the @xmath140 relation described in section  [ sec : pvsn ] .",
    "the anisotropic condensation stage is responsible for the power - law relation @xmath188 at @xmath189 , because gas flows along @xmath65 in the post - shock layer ( which generate structures with higher column density ) increase the inclination angle @xmath63 and therefore reduce the polarization fraction .",
    "this is also why models with higher inflow mach number has shallower @xmath140 curve ( smaller @xmath28 ; see table  [ sumtable ] ) , because stronger shocks create post - shock layers with smaller @xmath190 , and therefore @xmath63 remains small even after @xmath191 being amplified by the anisotropic condensation along @xmath65 . in dense regions where self - gravity dominates ( @xmath192 regime ) ,",
    "the dominant factor for reducing polarization fraction switches from inclination to tangledness .",
    "since the effect of tangledness on the polarization fraction is not monotonic ( the integration of @xmath193 and @xmath194 can lead to either cancellation or addition ) , the @xmath140 relation is relatively random at high column densities .      from figure  [ polarization ] , for each value of polarization fraction measured in observation ( i.e.  for every pixel of the 2d map )",
    ", we can estimate the maximum value of averaged inclination angle @xmath170 of the magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , our results indicate that if any two of the three quantities @xmath53 , @xmath165 , and @xmath169 are known , the third one can be derived . unfortunately , neither the inclination angle nor the magnetic field structure along the line of sight is observable . however , the dispersion of polarization angle on the plane of sky , @xmath195 , can be derived directly from the measured polarization emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . though there is no priori physical reason for the magnetic field structure to be similar along the line of sight and over the plane of sky , it is reasonable for the dispersions of @xmath65 in these two directions , @xmath165 and @xmath195 , to be correlated , since they are both induced by self - gravity and thus are dominated by the densest structures .",
    ", scatter - plotted against the dispersion on the plane of sky , @xmath195 .",
    "both axes are normalized by the maximum value in each model m5 ( _ top _ ) , m10 ( _ middle _ ) , and m20 ( _ bottom _ ) .",
    "the distributions are color - coded by the polarization fraction at each corresponding pixel .",
    "]    we calculated @xmath195 following the definition @xmath196 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath197 range from @xmath198 to @xmath199 so that @xmath195 represents the dispersion of polarization angle @xmath54 at each pixel among its @xmath200 nearest neighbors . figure  [ spos ] illustrates a positive correlation between @xmath165 and @xmath195 , as expected .",
    "therefore , for each value of @xmath195 derived from the observed polarization map , the range of @xmath165 can be estimated , which ( combined with the observed polarization fraction ) can provide a hint of the 3d magnetic field morphology by the corresponding @xmath170 value from figure  [ polarization ] .",
    "another interesting feature revealed in figure  [ spos ] is that the polarization fraction ( _ colormap _ ) is nearly independent of @xmath195 at a given @xmath165 value .",
    "also , the distribution of a given value of @xmath53 in figure  [ spos ] can be roughly described as @xmath201 , which provides a more straightforward way to estimate @xmath165 from observations .",
    "more detailed discussion about quantitative derivation of polarization - implied magnetic field morphology is postponed to a follow - up paper ( king et al .",
    ", _ in prep .",
    "using the histogram of relative orientation ( hro ) introduced by @xcite , we investigated the gas density and magnetic field structure in mhd simulations of prestellar core - forming regions formed through shock compression in gmcs , as described in and .",
    "we found that the relative orientation between density structure and magnetic field is directly impacted by the importance of self - gravity in the post - shock layer . specifically , the magnetic field morphology changes in dense regions where the gas is accelerated gravitationally and becomes super - alfvnic .",
    "the hro shape changes from concave to convex at the transition density @xmath87 , which is also the density for the field strength to transition from a more or less constant to a power - law increase with density . in the projected 2d map ,",
    "a similar change in hro shape is found to correlate with the column density below which the polarization fraction varies monotonically with column density .",
    "we interpreted the decrease of polarization fraction in terms of enhanced tangledness and inclination of the magnetic field , which , together with hros , may be applied to polarization observations to provide estimates on the total magnetic field strength and the 3d field structure .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    1 .",
    "our magnetic field@xmath2gas density plot shows characteristic features for the pre - shock , the post - shock , and the self - gravitating regions ( figure  [ bvsd_ma ] , _ left panel _ ) .",
    "the relatively unchanged magnetic field strength in the post - shock region ( @xmath202  @xmath10 ) is direct evidence of the anisotropic gas flow along the magnetic field line ( , ) . in the super - alfvenic , self - gravitating regime ( @xmath203  @xmath10 ) , the magnetic field strength is strongly correlated with the gas density with a power - law scaling ( see below ) .",
    "2 .   for densities above the threshold value @xmath87 , the @xmath84 curve follows a power law @xmath204 ( blue dotted lines in figure  [ bvsd_ma ] , _ left panel _ ) with @xmath205 ( table  [ sumtable ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath25 found in this work are consistent with previous observational and theoretical studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our fitting results imply that the field@xmath2density relation has strong dependence on the turbulent level of the cloud , with smaller @xmath25 for weaker turbulence .",
    "( section  [ sec : bn ] ) .",
    "we found that the threshold density in the @xmath84 relation , @xmath87 , is also where the 3d hro shape changes from concave to convex . in all three models considered in this work , hros with segmentations",
    "@xmath88 are concave , while those with segmentations @xmath89 are either flat or convex ( figure  [ bvsd_ma ] , _ right panel _ ; also see figure  [ bn_zeta ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the shape of hro , or the magnetic field@xmath2gas structure alignment , is strongly altered by the self - gravity of the gas in the high - density regime . specifically , the hro changes shape when the sub - afvnic gas is gravitationally accelerated to a super - afvnic speed , so that @xmath206 at @xmath207 ( figures  [ energy ] and [ ma ] )",
    ". the hro can therefore be used , at least conceptually , to estimate the density at the alfvnic transition , which , together with velocity information , yields the total field strength .",
    "similar behavior of hro in the 3d space is found in the 2d projected map , between the integrated polarization pseudo - vector @xmath50 ( see equation  ( [ pvec ] ) for definition ) and the gradient of column density @xmath49 ( figure  [ pvsn_ma ] ) .",
    "the transition of hro shape from concave to convex is related to the threshold value for the @xmath140 curve to stay relatively monotonic , @xmath136 ( figures  [ pvsn_ma ] and [ pvsn_zeta ] ) .",
    "our analysis showed that when the gas content is self - gravitating ( @xmath89 ) , the magnetic field morphology is significantly altered ( figure  [ dcutmap ] ) , and therefore the integrated polarization fraction along the line - of - sight is no longer dominated by the gas column density .",
    "as a result , the change of hro shape in the 2d projected map is also a consequence of increasing significance of gas self - gravity , and can be directly linked to the threshold density @xmath87 ( figure  [ dcutmap ] ) .",
    "5 .   for the non - self - gravitating regime ( @xmath189 ) in the 2d projected map , we found and fitted a power - law relationship to the @xmath140 curve ( blue dotted lines in figure  [ pvsn_ma ] , _ left panel _ ) , @xmath29 , with the index @xmath208 ( table  [ sumtable ] ) .",
    "these values are roughly consistent with , but at the low end of , previous observational and theoretical studies . based on our results , larger value of @xmath28",
    "may indicate a less turbulent environment , or a relatively weakly - magnetized medium ( table  [ sumtable ] ) .",
    "further simulations with more extended model parameters are necessary to firm up the conclusion .",
    "we demonstrated the polarization fraction is controlled by two factors : 1 ) the dispersion of the plane - of - sky magnetic field @xmath65 along the line - of - sight , @xmath165 , and 2 ) the averaged inclination angle of the magnetic field along the line - of - sight , @xmath170 ( figure  [ polarization ] , _ left panel _ ) .",
    "in addition , we showed that the mean inclination sets up an upper limit for the integrated polarization fraction ( appendix  [ gammader ] ) , while the tangledness of @xmath65 determines the distance of the actually measured polarization fraction to that maximum value ( figure  [ polarization ] , _ right panel _ ) . combined with the fact that there is a positive correlation between the dispersion of polarization angle on the plane of sky @xmath195 and the line - of - sight dispersion @xmath165 ( figure  [ spos ] )",

    ", the success of using the transition density in @xmath84 relation to explain different shapes of hro in both 3d simulation domain and 2d projected map is encouraging , which also suggests links between observable quantities ( @xmath49 , @xmath110 , @xmath53 , @xmath195 ) and gas properties in real space ( @xmath87 , @xmath109 , @xmath165 , @xmath170 ) .",

    "this also implies that , for a given line of sight , the polarization fraction is maximized only when two conditions are met : that the magnetic field orientation on the plane of the sky has low variation ( the field is ordered ) and that the magnetic inclination is minimized ( the magnetic field is principally in the plane of the sky ) . as noted above , this derivation does not use the revised definition of @xmath72 claimed by .",

    "<S> diffuse striations in molecular clouds are preferentially aligned with local magnetic fields whereas dense filaments tend to be perpendicular to them . </S>",
    "<S> when and why this transition occurs remain uncertain . to explore the physics behind this transition , we compute the histogram of relative orientation ( hro ) between the density gradient and the magnetic field in 3d mhd simulations of prestellar core formation in shock - compressed regions within gmcs . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , in the magnetically - dominated ( sub - alfvnic ) post - shock region , the gas structure is preferentially aligned with the local magnetic field . for overdense sub - regions with super - alfvnic gas , their elongation becomes preferentially perpendicular to the local magnetic field instead . </S>",
    "<S> the transition occurs when self - gravitating gas gains enough kinetic energy from the gravitational acceleration to overcome the magnetic support against the cross - field contraction , which results in a power - law increase of the field strength with density . </S>",
    "<S> similar results can be drawn from hros in projected 2d maps with integrated column densities and synthetic polarized dust emission . </S>",
    "<S> we quantitatively analyze our simulated polarization properties , and interpret the reduced polarization fraction at high column densities as the result of increased distortion of magnetic field directions in trans- or super - alfvnic gas . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we introduce measures of the inclination and tangledness of the magnetic field along the line of sight as the controlling factors of the polarization fraction . observations of the polarization fraction and angle dispersion can therefore be utilized in studying local magnetic field morphology in star - forming regions . </S>"
