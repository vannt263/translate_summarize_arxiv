    "one of the intriguing results from five years of grb localizations by  is that roughly 60@xmath3 of well - localized grbs lack an optical transient despite intensive searches ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". some of these `` dark '' grbs could simply be due to a failure to image deeply or quickly enough @xcite .",
    "however , in certain cases the optical afterglow may have been missed either because it is obscured by dust in the host galaxy , or because it is located at high redshift ( @xmath4 ) .    in the first few months of the `` afterglow era '' , which began with the localization of the x - ray afterglow of grb 970228 @xcite , the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) detected a grb that falls in the category of `` dark '' .",
    "the bright event detected on ut 1997 august 15.50491 and labeled  had a total @xmath5-ray fluence @xmath6 erg @xmath7 , placing it in the top 15@xmath3 of the batse fluence distribution .",
    "nearly simultaneous detection by the  asm refined the position of  to a small error box @xcite .",
    "the localization by the  asm was followed several days later by  @xcite and  @xcite pointings .",
    "while a bright x - ray source was detected just outside the asm error box , it was never associated with the grb because it was not clearly fading and because prompt optical observations failed to reveal an optical transient to limiting magnitude @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in a subsequent review of the evidence we hypothesized nevertheless that  was the afterglow of , and proposed that this could be tested @xcite . in this paper , we present new  and optical observations of this source , which , together with an analysis of the  and data , indicate that  was one of the earliest and most luminous `` dark '' bursts in the afterglow era [ see @xcite for a complete list ] .",
    "in addition , we discuss the unusual softening over the burst s multiple peaks , which suggests that the intrinsic properties grb 970815 varied over the duration of the event .",
    "finally , we mention the implications for the counterpart of the steady unidentified egret source  @xcite , whose error ellipse includes the position of .",

    "the superposed annulus based on the batse and _ ulysses _ triangulation confirmed the asm position @xcite .",
    "the prompt ( 1.512 kev ) x - ray light curve had a multiple - peak structure lasting @xmath8  s , and reaching a maximum intensity of @xmath9  crab @xcite .    following the prompt localization by",
    ", two x - ray observations were made that covered the entire  error box , one by  and one by the  high resolution imager ( hri ) .",
    "the  observation took place on ut 1997 august 18.7119.88 , 3.24.4 days after the burst @xcite , for a total usable exposure time of 54.8 ks in both gas imaging spectrometer ( gis ) and solid - state imaging spectrometer ( sis ) detectors .",
    "analysis of the data revealed no source brighter than 1 @xmath10  ergs  @xmath7  s@xmath11 within the  error box .",
    "there was , however , a source ax  j1606.8 + 8130 just outside the error box with an average flux @xmath12(210  kev ) @xmath13  ergs  @xmath7  s@xmath11 .",
    "figure  [ box ] shows the combined  sis image and the location of ax  j1606.8 + 8130 with respect to the burst error box .",
    "the second x - ray observation of the  error box was obtained during ut 1997 august 20.9922.73 with the   hri , 5.57.2 days after the burst , with a total exposure time of 17.1  ks @xcite . this observation ( fig .  [ box ] )",
    "detected a source at ( j2000.0 ) @xmath14 , consistent with but more precise than the position of the  source ( hereafter referred to as ) .",
    "the count rate @xmath15  s@xmath11 extracted from a @xmath16 radius centered on rx  j1606.8 + 8130 corresponds to an extrapolated flux in the 210 kev band of @xmath17  ergs  @xmath7  s@xmath11 , or @xmath18 the  value .",
    "this extrapolation assumes the power - law spectral parameters derived in the next section from the  source .",
    "in addition , @xcite noted a fainter  source rx  j1608.8 + 8131 with a flux of @xmath19  ergs  @xmath7  s@xmath11 in the 0.12.4  kev band .",
    "this clouded the interpretation because , although rx  j1608.8 + 8131 lies inside the  error box , its existence is of marginal statistical significance .",
    "this possible source does not warrant further comment , as it was not detected in the earlier  observation .",
    "we concentrate our attention on the brighter source  which , although it lies just outside the  error box , is within the batse/_ulysses _ annulus .",
    "the  gis and sis spectra of  are shown in figure  [ spec ] .",
    "we fitted the spectra individually as well as jointly with common model parameters by treating the normalization constant as a free parameter .",
    "a simple absorbed power - law model provides a good description of the spectrum with photon index @xmath20 and @xmath21  @xmath7 ( the error bars corresponds to 90% confidence for two interesting parameters ) .",
    "the fitted spectral index is insensitive to galactic absorbing column density whether @xmath22 is treated as a free parameter or held fixed at the maximum galactic value in this direction , @xmath23  @xmath7 .    since discrete x - ray emission features have been reported in a few grb afterglow spectra ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we looked for discrete emission features , absorption edges and narrow radiative recombination continua in the x - ray spectrum following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the absence of a redshift determination weakens the search .",
    "thus , we proceeded to determine upper limits on equivalent width by holding the power - law model parameters fixed and assuming a gaussian line profile of fixed velocity width .",
    "the derived upper limit ( 90% confidence level ) corresponds to ew @xmath24  kev at 1.5  kev for a line of fwhm comparable to grb 991216 @xcite .",
    "this is less than than the reported ew measurement in grb 991216 , so long as the redshift of  does not exceed @xmath25 .",

    "* ) onboard the  x - ray observatory @xcite .",
    "the source  was positioned at the default location on the back - illuminated s3 ccd of the acis - s array .",
    "the standard timed readout with a frame time of 3.2  s was used , and the data were collected in vfaint mode .",
    "a total of 10130  s of on - time was accumulated , while the effective exposure live - time was 9998  s. we verified that the  astrometry is accurate to @xmath26 or better in each coordinate by identifying four serendipitous sources on our optical images . within the @xmath27 radius error circle of , there is no  point source with more than one photon in the 0.210  kev band . adopting a 96% confidence upper limit of five photons , we convert to a flux upper limit in the 210  kev band using the  spectral index @xmath28 and @xmath21  @xmath7 .",
    "the web - based simulator pimms allows us to make this conversion while accounting for the time - dependent degradation of the acis throughput in the ao5 observing period in which the observation was conducted .",
    "the result is @xmath29 ergs  @xmath7  s@xmath11 , or less than 1% of the  measured flux in the same band .",
    "such a dramatic disappearance is strong evidence that was the afterglow of . in combination with the lack of an optical counterpart such as a variable star or galactic nucleus ( see below ) , this identification is compelling .",
    "we also note that nothing was detected by  at the location of the marginal  source rx  j1608.8 + 8131 @xcite to a similar flux limit . in the absence of any other evidence for the existence of this source , we conclude that it was never real .",
    "-0.2 in      figure  [ lc ] shows the combined x - ray light curve of .",
    "comparison of the various energy channels of the asm and batse indicates that the third and final peak in the asm ( 1.512 kev ) prompt emission , the one that began @xmath8 after the batse trigger , has the softest spectrum with a peak energy in @xmath30 of @xmath31 kev and a photon index @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the latter authors suggested that this third peak is the beginning of the afterglow phase as a relativistic shock decelerates .",
    "the flux during the third peak , converted here from the reported asm flux to the 210 kev energy band , reached a maximum @xmath33 ergs @xmath7 s@xmath11 ( @xmath9  crab ) at @xmath34  s after the batse trigger @xcite .",
    "it then dimmed drastically during the next 148  s to @xmath35 ergs @xmath7 s@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "fitting the asm points to a power law requires a decay as steep as @xmath36 with the origin of time set at the batse trigger .",
    "we show this early decay phase in figure  [ lc ] .",
    "the  light curve in figure  [ lc ] consists of the sum of the counts from all four of its detectors .",
    "the  points correspond to an extrapolated flux in the 210  kev band assuming the power - law spectral parameters derived from .",
    "the individual  and  components of the light curve show no obvious evidence for variability .",
    "however , if the flux remained constant between the  and  observation , then we should expect to find a total of @xmath37 source photons in the 0.1@xmath382.0  kev  energy band , whereas only 63 net photons are detected in the hri observation .",
    "the poisson probability of obtaining 63 or fewer events when 114 are expected is @xmath39 .",
    "instead , we find that the flux of  is more consistent with a @xmath40 decay between the  and   observations , easily within the range of well - studied grb x - ray afterglows . if we extrapolate the 210 kev x - ray flux from 500  s to @xmath41  s after the burst using @xmath42 , we get a fluence of @xmath43 ergs  @xmath7 or @xmath44 of the burst fluence , which is in agreement with the properties of other grbs @xcite .",
    "following the rapid dissemination of the  position for , a number of groups obtained optical images of its error box including the position of .",
    "no significant variable source was found in or near the  error box to limits @xmath45 @xcite , @xmath46 @xcite , and @xmath0 @xcite starting 1417 hours after the burst . much later , while conducting a search for the @xmath5-ray source  @xcite , we obtained deep optical images in several colors of the x - ray position of  with the mdm observatory 1.3  m and 2.4  m telescopes over the period 2001 june  2004 july . figure  [ opt ] shows a @xmath47-band image obtained on 2004 july  12 .",
    "the adopted @xmath27 radius  error circle is conservative , since the  aspect is confirmed by the detection of the bright star bd+82  477 in the same image @xcite .",
    "the error circle is blank to a 3@xmath48 limit of @xmath1 , which corresponds to @xmath49 for the  source under the definition of @xcite . in other filters ,",
    "shows no evidence of a host galaxy or any other optical counterpart to limits of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath2 .",
    "such extreme @xmath52 ratios are seen only among isolated neutron stars or low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "the former is ruled out here by the extreme x - ray variability , and the latter by the absence of an optical counterpart .",
    "thus , we are convinced that the x - ray afterglow of  was detected .",
    "several non - detections were obtained with the vla between 1 and 103 days after the burst at frequencies of 4.89 and 8.44  ghz @xcite .",
    "the rms noise in these observations ranged from 98 to 16 @xmath53jy .",
    "although the /  light curve supports a possible decay for  @xcite , the follow - up efforts for were abandoned prematurely , we judge in hindsight , mainly because of the small positional inconsistency of  with the  error box , and the absence of an optical afterglow .",
    "little was known about `` dark '' grbs at the time to motivate further observations .",
    "in fact , the `` dark '' grb hypothesis is justified when one extrapolates the x - ray decay and spectral index backward to predict the optical magnitude at the time of the reported optical observations .",
    "it is important to note that there are now many examples of non - monotonic decays in grb afterglows ; therefore , the observed behavior of  may not be representative of its long - term decay .",
    "however , the following analysis is reasonable as long as the deviations are not extreme . starting with the observed x - ray flux density @xmath54 , we can extrapolate a broad - band spectrum of the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the @xmath57-band optical flux density at a frequency @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the x - ray spectral index . from the  spectra we have @xmath60jy ( @xmath61",
    "hz ) at a time @xmath62 days after the burst , and @xmath63 .",
    "the optical flux density evolution would then correspond to @xmath64jy where @xmath65 is days elapsed since the batse trigger .",
    "this translates into @xmath66 on ut 1997 august  16.31 .",
    "therefore , the predicted magnitude is brighter than the @xmath46 @xcite , or @xmath0 @xcite upper limits reported at that time .",
    "the difference would require an observer - frame extinction @xmath67 4 mag .    in order to convert the observer - frame extinction to the rest frame of the host galaxy ,",
    "we make a simple assumption that its redshift falls near the average grb redshift , @xmath68 .",
    "this is a conservative assumption for the sake of our argument , since the required rest - frame extinction increases if @xmath69 . at @xmath70 ,",
    "the effective @xmath57-band wavelength is @xmath71  .",
    "assuming an extinction curve with a fixed form @xcite , this translates into a visual extinction @xmath72 2 mag .",
    "a rest - frame extinction @xmath73 for @xmath74 implies significant dust extinction at the host galaxy , possibly characteristic of molecular clouds at the birth site of the grb progenitor @xcite , and supports a `` dark '' grb description .",
    "based on the plausible values of observed column density ( @xmath21  @xmath7 ) , we can not formally rule out large extinction at the host galaxy from the x - ray spectra alone .",
    "in fact , this maximum allowed column density ( 90@xmath3 confidence level ) would translate to @xmath75 @xmath7 at @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the derived @xmath76 is well within the characteristic column density for giant molecular clouds found in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath74 are also in rough agreement with the relation between @xmath77 and @xmath22 for the milky way @xcite .",
    "it is possible that effects such as dust sublimation @xcite and grain charging @xcite can play a significant role in grb environments .",
    "these dust destruction mechanisms could be effective as far as @xmath78 100 pc from the burst site , which might lead to gray dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and lower extinction ( galama & wijers 2001 ) .",
    "alternatively , the absence of an optical afterglow could be attributed to a high redshift @xmath79 for which the lyman break moves into the @xmath57 passband . however",
    ", if interpreted as a jet at @xmath80 , grb 970815 would require a very small opening angle @xmath81 , once corrected for a standard energy reservoir @xcite .",
    "such a small angle might be difficult to achieve in an expanding jet breaking through the circumburst medium .      of the synchrotron models involving a blast wave expanding relativistically in a stellar - wind medium @xcite , the combination of electron power - law distribution index @xmath82 , spectral index @xmath59 = @xmath83 , and decay slope @xmath84",
    ", corresponding to @xmath85 , provides a remarkably good description for the afterglow as measured by  and .",
    "such a model , however , can not account for the significantly steeper decay index ( @xmath86 ) in the asm light curve ( fig .",
    "one possibility is that the steepening in the decay follows the passage of the typical frequency @xmath87 through the x - ray band .",
    "however , this transition should steepen to @xmath88 @xcite , which yields a physically unreasonable @xmath89 .",
    "similar theoretical predictions for the decay of reverse shock emission impose an equally extreme @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "this led @xcite to suggest that the final peak might be due to refreshed shocks or density inhomogeneities .",
    "it is , however , difficult to reconcile a steep decay with energy or density variations @xcite .",
    "thus , by a process of elimination , we find it unlikely that the asm data represent the beginning of the afterglow .    instead , we propose that the third peak represents a continuation of the prompt grb emission and the onset of a soft xrf .",
    "the latter are believed to arise from a softer grb mechanism that produces a peak energy of order 1  kev @xmath91 40  kev @xcite . remarkably , the observed peaks in grb 970815 drift by a large factor during the duration of the burst , reaching a first maximum with @xmath92 kev at @xmath93 1  s , another at @xmath93 98  s in the @xmath94 kev range , and a pronounced third with @xmath31 kev at @xmath93 152  s , in which an 8  s delay between the maximum in the c band ( @xmath95  kev ) and the a band ( @xmath96  kev ) is observed @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the third peak has a duration ( @xmath97 80  s ) and power - law spectrum ( @xmath98 ) comparable to the parameters of xrfs measured by , batse and _ hete2 _ @xcite .",
    "this might be an indication that the individual properties of an xrf and a `` normal '' grb can coincide in a single event .",
    "a possibly related phenomenon is the hard - to - soft spectral evolution that has been seen in a number of  and _ hete2 _ grbs @xcite .",
    "in addition , the precursors and tails of some grbs seen by _ ginga _ had spectral properties similar to xrfs [ see @xcite and references therein ] . since the prompt emission is a function of various physical parameters , it is unclear what provides the necessary softening over multiple peaks .",
    "however , a variable lorentz factor in a long - lived , `` tired '' central engine , or a decreasing magnetic field are attractive possibilities @xcite .",
    "our analysis of  also has implications for the completeness of the survey for a counterpart of the unidentified egret source  @xcite , whose error ellipse includes the position of .",
    "based on existing x - ray and radio data , the fr  i radio galaxy ngc  6251 ranks as the most likely counterpart for   @xcite now that  has been eliminated from consideration .",
    "ngc  6251 is a notable object because of the possible link between bl  lac objects and fr i radio galaxies .",
    "fr  i radio galaxies are hypothesized to be the likely parent populations of bl  lac objects , which are believed to be fr  i radio galaxies with jets pointing near the line of sight @xcite . in the third egret catalog @xcite cen  a ( ngc  5128 ) is the only fr  i radio galaxy identified as a source at energies above 100  mev @xcite .",
    "ngc  6251 could then be the second fr  i radio galaxy to be detected in high - energy @xmath5-rays .",
    "in summary , our verification of the transient nature of  and the lack of an optical counterpart for it compel the conclusion that  was an optically `` dark '' grb , quite possibly the first one in the afterglow era . its light curve can be fitted by a power - law decay of index @xmath42 between the  and  observations , with a spectrum of photon index @xmath20 .",
    "analysis of the  asm observation leads to the conclusion that at least some grbs exhibit properties that are similar to xrfs after the cessation of `` normal '' gamma - ray activity .",
    "such a detection suggests that variations in the intrinsic properties of the burst might account partly for the observed distribution of xrfs and grbs .",
    "this finding warrants a fresh examination of archival optical / ir data , as well as follow - up optical , ir , and sub - mm observations to search more deeply for a host galaxy and determine if it is obscured by dust or located at high redshift .",
    "even if ambiguous within the  hri error circle , identification of the host may be supported by spectroscopic detection of strong ly@xmath99 emission , a common signature of large star formation rates in grb host galaxies @xcite .",
