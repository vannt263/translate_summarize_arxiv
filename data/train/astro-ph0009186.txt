    "this work from other programs with hst is that we have used multiple pointings to cover a wide area around the cluster .",
    "the advantage of this approach for many issues relating to cluster and early - type galaxy evolution became clear as the project developed .",
    "the results from this program have resulted in two dissertations ( daniel kelson : ucsc 1998 , and pieter van dokkum : groningen 1999 ) .",
    "we have used multiple pointings on hst to image regions with wfpc2 that are typically 57@xmath4 @xmath5 57@xmath4 in size .",
    "this corresponds to a field size of roughly 1.5@xmath6 ",

    "an example of the mosaic hst images for one of our cluster fields is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the fields were imaged with two filters , f606w and f814w .",
    "spectroscopy was carried out using the keck lris multi - object spectrograph , with a field comparable to that of the hst mosaics .",
    "the scientific goals of this program have included constraining the evolution of early - type galaxies , identifying the galaxy characteristics across the cluster as a function of environment and density , analysis of the cluster s spatial and velocity structure , and determining the mass distribution through weak lensing .",

    "1997 , and van dokkum et al .",
    "1998a ) , we have used the offsets in @xmath30 from coma to set even stronger constraints , on the luminosity - weighted ages , and on the cosmology , as shown in figure 3 ( van dokkum et al .",
    "an einstein - de sitter ( @xmath20 ) is only consistent with the data if the imf is substantially steeper than salpeter .",

    "tighter constraints would be placed by observing even slightly higher redshift clusters , though the spectroscopy becomes very time - consuming , even with keck !",
    "the color - magnitude ( cm ) relations provide a complementary approach to the fundamental plane for characterizing the evolution of early - type galaxies .",
    "they provide an independent means of constraining @xmath33 .",
    "the use of such relations brings a benefit in that larger samples can be readily obtained ( redshifts are easier than velocity dispersions ) , but the use of these relations for constraining the star formation history of old stellar populations does require very accurate photometry .",
    "this can be done with hst data , which also enables the required morphological determinations to be made .",
    "the value of such data can be seen in figure 4 ( see fig4.jpg ) where color images from hst show the range of morphological and structural information that can be obtained in cl1358 + 62 at @xmath2 .",
    "an extensive cm analysis of the large sample of members with spectroscopic redshifts in cl 1358 + 62 was carried out by van dokkum et al .",
    "( 1998b ) .",
    "the key to this analysis was the very accurate photometry that could be carried out on the wfpc2 images . for galaxies with @xmath34 ,",
    "the photometric uncertainty was demonstrated to be 0.009 mag , rising to only 0.017 mag for fainter objects . with 194 members over a radius of 4.6 arcmin , or 1.2 @xmath6 mpc , the colors of galaxies could be investigated as a function of radius .",
    "as shown in figure 5 , the elliptical galaxy population shows very small scatter at both small and large radii , and no significant change in scatter with radius ( a biweight estimator was used to minimize the effects of outliers ) .",
    "the s0 galaxies likewise show little scatter at small radii , and are essentially identical to the ellipticals , but at larger radii the s0 population is bluer and shows substantially larger scatter : a factor 2 higher than that of the s0s in the center ( or the ellipticals at all radii ) .",
    "the difference in the mean color ( to bluer colors ) in the s0 populations is significant at the 95% confidence level . for the ellipticals at all",
    "radii , and the s0s in the central regions , the scatter implies a luminosity - weighted age distribution with @xmath35 , while the luminosity - weighted age distribution for the s0s at @xmath36 is @xmath37 , with ( some ) outer s0s experiencing star formation almost to the epoch of observation at @xmath2 .",
    "this powerful technique is also being applied to our other clusters .",
    ", as a function of radius in the cluster .",
    "the scatter in the cm relation of the inner region s0s is the same as the ellipticals ( which show no dependence with radius ) .",
    "outside @xmath38 , the scatter in the s0 colors is larger than that of the ellipticals and inner s0s by a factor 2 , and they are bluer in the mean .",
    "the radius 118@xmath39 was chosen so as to split the sample into two equal groups . ]",
    "the value of the large field coverage of our hst imaging was demonstrated again with our mosaic on ms 1054 - 03 at @xmath1 ( figure 1 ) , when the morphological types of the 89 members that resulted from the keck lris spectroscopic magnitude - limited sample ( @xmath40 ) were analyzed .",
    "the morphological types were split 22% e , 22% s0 , 39% spiral and 17% _ merger / peculiar_. to find such a high fraction of luminous merger / peculiar galaxies in such a rich cluster at such a late time was a surprise .",
    "the morphological types of the most luminous galaxies in ms 1054 - 03 , plus the lower luminosity merger / peculiar objects , are shown in figure 6 ( see fig6.jpg ) .",
    "these results are discussed in more detail in van dokkum et al .",
    "the color magnitude diagram shown in figure 7b demonstrates one of the remarkable aspects of the mergers in this cluster  they are quite red , with no detected [ oii]3727 emission , suggesting minimal ongoing star formation .",
    "the mergers are also found in the outer parts of the cluster , suggesting that they are in infalling clumps ( figure 7a ) .",
    "most of these mergers are likely to evolve into luminous ( @xmath41 ) early - type galaxies , presumably ellipticals , but also possibly s0s .",
    "if confirmed to be generally the case in other rich @xmath14 0.51 clusters , this result suggests that the merging rate in the cluster environment is changing rapidly with redshift ( possibly as fast as @xmath42 ) .",
