    "the role of spin - fluctuations in superconducting materials has been a subject of sustained interest for the last 50 years . in 1960s",
    "doniach @xcite and berk and schrieffer @xcite made the important observation that itinerant ferromagnetic spin - fluctuations tend to suppress superconductivity in elemental s - wave superconductors .",
    "they pointed out that the absence of superconductivity in heavy transition elements such as palladium and platinum is due to the itinerant ferromagnetic spin - fluctuations resulting from the large @xmath6-electron density of states near the fermi level .",
    "the same formalism was used to suggest that the superconducting transition temperature t@xmath7 of elements such as nb and v was limited by spin - fluctuations @xcite .",
    "hence it was conjectured that when these metals were properly engineered in the form of alloys , the t@xmath7 could increase significantly as was observed in nb@xmath8sn , and v@xmath8si , etc . ,",
    "later on , the effects of localized spin - fluctuations on the properties of dilute superconducting alloys were studied by zukermann @xcite .",
    "he showed that the superconducting transition shifted to temperatures lower than those expected from the band structure calculations performed without considering the spin - fluctuations @xcite . on the other hand , many families of superconductors have been identified during last 30 years , where spin - fluctuations actually play an important role in the superconductivity itself .",
    "these include various exotic low temperature superconductors such as y@xmath9co@xmath10 @xcite , cecoin@xmath11 @xcite , ube@xmath12 @xcite , sr@xmath13ruo@xmath14 @xcite , fese @xcite , and mo@xmath8sb@xmath10 @xcite etc .",
    "this concept of spin - fluctuation influenced superconductivity , however , came into much prominence in connection with the high temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "this has now become a subject of even more attention with the discovery of a newer class of fe based high temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "most recently it has been reported that the longitudinal ferromagnetic spin - fluctuations induce superconductivity in ucoge @xcite .",
    "it is well known that any addition of a magnetic impurity in non - transition element based s - wave superconductor suppresses the superconductivity due to the pair breaking .",
    "it is also reported in literature that even the addition of the non magnetic transition elements also suppresses the t@xmath15 @xcite due to the formation of localized states .",
    "however , it has been observed that the t@xmath7 of a dirty limit superconductor is not effected significantly by disorder @xcite , in fact a very high level of disorder is required to change the t@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "surprisingly an enhancement in t@xmath15 is observed in spite of increased disorder when certain transition elements are alloyed , even though these elements either have t@xmath7 s lower than the host material , or are non superconducting @xcite .",
    "the present ti - v alloys are the examples of one such system @xcite . in recent times",
    ", it has been recognized that ti - v alloys with their good mechanical , thermal and superconducting properties @xcite can be promising candidates for application as superconducting magnets in the environment of heavy neutron irradiation as in a fusion reactor @xcite .",
    "in addition , higher value of lower - critical field h@xmath16(0 ) of ti - v alloys at 2  k @xcite as compared to the commercial polycrystalline nb samples @xcite makes them potential candidates for superconducting rf cavity applications .",
    "thus a complete understanding of the normal and superconducting states in these ti - v alloys can lead to the possibility of enhancing their superconducting properties ( e.g. , increasing the experimental superconducting transition temperature t@xmath7 , the lower critical field h@xmath16(0 ) and the upper critical field h@xmath17(0 ) to the theoretical limits ) and enhancing other functional properties like critical current density by suitable engineering techniques .",
    "however , several features of ti - v alloys are not understood yet , of which we list below the two significant anomalies .",
    "there is an increase in t@xmath7 when ti content is increased from zero to 40 at .",
    "% in v @xcite . the significant enhancement in debye temperature @xmath18 or the electron phonon coupling is not expected in ti - v alloys as ti and v are adjacent atoms .",
    "the density of states decreases as ti content is increased in v @xcite .",
    "hence , the increase in t@xmath7 in ti - v alloys does not follow the mcmillan formula .",
    "there is a large region in h - t phase diagram where superconducting fluctuations are observed well above t@xmath7 and well above h@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "hake and coworkers @xcite have shown that superconducting fluctuations well above t@xmath7 and well above h@xmath17 are intrinsic property of certain class of transition element binary alloys such as ti - v , ti - mo and ti - ru systems .",
    "they have also observed that these fluctuations are not dependent on the sample preparation , surface polishing , size and shape of the sample and on the current density .",
    "several models such as the occurrence of reversible @xmath19 phase in the @xmath20 matrix @xcite , weak localization @xcite , kondo ( s - d ) interaction @xcite and associated localized spin fluctuation @xcite have been considered for explaining the observed physical properties in ti - v alloys .",
    "the increase in magnetic susceptibility with temperature was attributed mainly to the occurrence of reversible @xmath19 phase in the @xmath20 matrix @xcite . according to this model , the metastable hexagonal closed pack ( hcp ) @xmath19 phase appears inside the body centered cubic ( bcc ) @xmath20 phase when the temperature is decreased below 300  k. however",
    ", this model does not explain the large difference between the experimental value of superconducting transition temperature t@xmath7 and that estimated theoretically @xcite .",
    "prekul et al @xcite on the other hand invoked the idea of the localized spin fluctuations to understand the normal state properties of ti - v alloys .",
    "however , this model could not explain the superconductivity fluctuations observed well above t@xmath7 and well above h@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "in this direction we present a detailed study of the superconducting and normal state properties of a ti@xmath0v@xmath1 alloy investigated through the measurements of temperature dependence of electrical resistivity , dc magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity in the presence of zero and externally applied magnetic fields .",
    "the observed temperature dependence of the normal state properties is explained within the realm of itinerant spin - fluctuation model .",
    "the sample was prepared by taking high purity titanium ( 99.99  % , alfa aesar ) and vanadium ( 99 +  % , aldrich ) in stoichiometric proportion and melting in an arc furnace under high purity argon atmosphere .",
    "the sample was flipped and re - melted four times to ensure homogeneity .",
    "the sample was then wrapped in ta - foil and sealed in quartz ampoule in argon atmosphere , and was annealed at 1573  k for 10 hours .",
    "the sample temperature was then lowered to 1273  k before quenching into the ice water .",
    "the angle dispersive x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurement were performed in a powder xrd beam line bl-12 @xcite at 19  kev ( 0.65 x 10@xmath21  m ) x - rays from indus-2 synchrotron radiation source at raja ramanna centre for advanced technology , indore .",
    "the beam line is based on si ( 311 ) double crystal monochromator and adaptive focusing optics .",
    "an image plate area detector ( mar-345 dtb ) and fit2d software were used for data acquisition and data reduction , respectively .",
    "nist lab6 standard was used for wavelength calibration .",
    "the resistivity measurements as functions of temperature and magnetic field were performed in a 5  t magnet - cryostat ( american magnetics inc , usa ) using a standard four - probe geometry .",
    "the magnetization measurements were performed using a 9  t vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ; quantum design , usa ) and a 7  t squid magnetometer ( mpms - xl ; quantum design , usa ) .",
    "the heat capacity measurements were performed using a 9  t physical property measurement system ( ppms ; quantum design , usa ) .",
    "the ti - v alloys form in @xmath20 phase for ti composition exceeding 20 at .",
    "the space group corresponding to @xmath20 phase is body centered cubic ( bcc ) im@xmath22 m with ti or v occupying 2a site randomly .",
    "figure 1 shows the xrd pattern of ti@xmath0v@xmath1 alloy along with the fitted curve obtained using rietveld refinement .",
    "all the peaks observed in xrd pattern are correspond to the @xmath20 phase in the ti@xmath0v@xmath1 alloy .",
    "the rietveld analysis ( red solid line ) shows that the sample is formed in bcc structure with lattice parameters 0.31879(2 )  nm , which is in agreement with the literature @xcite .",
    "figure 2 presents the superconducting properties of ti@xmath0v@xmath1 .",
    "figure 2a shows the temperature dependence of magnetization measured using vsm in the temperature range 2 - 7.2  k in an applied field of 10  mt .",
    "the measurements were performed in the zero field cooled ( zfc ) , field cooled cooling ( fcc ) and field cooled warming ( fcw ) modes . in the zfc mode ,",
    "the sample is first cooled from a temperature well above 10  k to 2  k in zero field and then the measurements are performed while warming up the sample in presence of 10  mt . in the fcc mode , the magnetic field ( 10  mt )",
    "is applied at a temperature well above 10  k , and the measurement is done while cooling the sample down to 2  k. after reaching 2  k , the measurement is continued while warming up the sample in the same field and this last protocol is called fcw .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature t@xmath7 is the temperature at which the m(t ) starts to drop towards the negative value when temperature is decreased .",
    "the t@xmath7 thus estimated at 10  mt is about 7.15  k , which is in agreement with the literature @xcite .",
    "the t@xmath7 of ti@xmath0v@xmath1 is higher than that for elemental vanadium ( 5.4 k @xcite ) or titanium ( 0.9  k @xcite ) .",
    "the meissner fraction is estimated as m@xmath23(2 k)/m@xmath24(2k ) is about 7 x 10@xmath25 at 10  mt which indicates the strong flux pinning .",
    "figure 2b shows the magnetization as a function of magnetic field measured using vsm at various constant temperatures below superconducting transition temperature 7.15  k. the measurements were performed as a function of magnetic field after cooling the sample from well above the 10  k to the desired temperature in zero magnetic field .",

    "2c shows the effect of magnetic field ( up to 5  t ) on the superconducting transition temperature ; an application of 5  t suppresses the t@xmath7 to 5.66  k. we have observed a rounding - off behavior in the temperature dependence of resistivity just above the t@xmath7 .",
    "figure 2d shows the temperature dependence of heat capacity plotted as c / t as a function of t@xmath2 in selected magnetic fields . the application of magnetic field shifts the heat capacity peak to lower temperature .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature t@xmath27 is obtained as that temperature at which a deviation is observed from the normal state linearity in c / t v / s t@xmath2 plot . in zero magnetic field , t@xmath27 is estimated to be about 7.17  k. at 8  t magnetic field , the superconducting transition is observed at 4.8  k.there is no difference in normal state heat capacity between the zero field data to that in magnetic fields . the sommerfeld coefficient of electronic heat capacity @xmath28 and the debye temperature @xmath18 are obtained to be about 9.46(2 ) x 10@xmath29 j/ mol k@xmath2 and 258.5(2 ) k respectively by fitting a straight line to the normal state heat capacity data in figure 2d . the jump in heat capacity @xmath30c/@xmath28t@xmath7 across the t@xmath7 in the zero magnetic field",
    "is estimated at the onset of the transition t@xmath27 as well as at the middle of the transition t@xmath31 = 6.63  k. the @xmath30c/@xmath28t@xmath27 is about 2.65 whereas @xmath30c/@xmath28t@xmath31 is about 2.22 indicating that ti@xmath0v@xmath1 is a bulk and a strong coupling superconductor .",
    "the value of t@xmath27 is in agreement with the t@xmath7 estimated using resistivity and magnetization measurements .",
    "the upper critical field h@xmath17 at various temperatures were estimated from such isothermal m - h curves is shown in fig .",

    ". however , the temperature range over which this fluctuation is observed is limited to 7.25 to 8.03  k. the upturn in @xmath32 below 7.25  k is due to the broadening of the superconducting transition @xcite .",

    ", the temperature and magnetic field dependence of resistivity in the temperature range t@xmath7=7.15  k to 14.3  k in ti@xmath0v@xmath1 is due to the excess conductivity or the fluctuation conductivity resulting from cooper pair fluctuations well above t@xmath7 .",
    "then the effect of the magnetic field is to break the cooper pairs and drive the sample to its normal state .",
    "lue et al have shown experimentally that the magnetic field required to drive a system into normal state is more than the h@xmath17(0 ) @xcite for temperature even above t@xmath7 .",
    "the observed large positive magnetoresistance above t@xmath7 can not be accounted by the al fluctuation conductivity in presence of magnetic field for a 3d superconductor in the dirty limit is given by @xcite . in case of niobium as well as alloy and compound superconductors such as nb@xmath8sn",
    ", it is reported that the disorder generated by the high flux neutron irradiation does not decrease the t@xmath7 significantly @xcite .",
    "as pointed out earlier @xcite , the moderate disorder does not influence the transition temperature in dirty limit superconductors .",
    "very high disorders are required to drive the t@xmath7 to lower temperatures which are accompanied by a transition from superconducting state to insulating state at t@xmath7 @xcite . since",
    ", our system is a metallic and when vanadium is alloyed with the titanium , the t@xmath7 of the alloy increases , the origin of the observed fluctuation conductivity in ti@xmath0v@xmath1 may not be due to the disorder present in the alloy .",

    "the figure 7 shows the temperature dependence of the heat capacity c for ti@xmath0v@xmath1 in the temperature range 20 - 220  k. the fitted line represents the expression @xmath28 t + d(t/@xmath18 ) , where @xmath28 is the sommerfeld coefficient of electronic specific heat and d(t/@xmath18 ) is the debye specific heat for lattice .",
    "a good fitting to the experimental heat capacity curve is obtained only in the high temperature region ( 150 - 220  k ) .",
    "the value of @xmath28 and @xmath18 obtained as the fitting parameters are about 8.06(1 ) x 10@xmath29  j / mol k@xmath2 and 322.5(4 )  k respectively .",
    "the fitted @xmath28 t + d(t/@xmath18 ) curve deviates from the experimental curve below 105  k ( inset to the fig . 7 . ) .",
    "the figure 8 shows the c / t plotted as a function of t@xmath2 in the temperature range 7 - 45  k. a nonlinearity is observed in c / t with respect to t@xmath2 .",
    "such nonlinearity as well as the deviation from @xmath28 t + d(t/@xmath18 ) might originate from a finite temperature dependence of the debye temperature @xmath18 in a bcc structure @xcite .",
    "normally , the @xmath18 increases with decrease in temperature below 30  k , especially in case of bcc systems the values at low temperature increases more than that at room temperature @xcite .",
    "the variation of @xmath18 for elemental bcc vanadium in the temperature range 4.2  k to 300  k estimated by measuring elastic constants is about 403.8  k to 392.1  k which is about 3  % @xcite . in ti@xmath0v@xmath1 alloy",
    "we have observed that @xmath18 estimated from the low temperature fit is about 258  k which is quite low when compared to that estimated at high temperatures .",
    "hence , we believe that the origin of the difference between the experimentally observed heat capacity and the heat capacity estimated using @xmath28 t + d(t/@xmath18 ) is not due to the temperature variation of the @xmath18 . however , we have done the thermal expansion measurement to estimate the debye temperature @xcite as function of temperature @xcite .",
    "we have observed that the variation in @xmath18 with temperature in the range 30 - 300  k is about 7.5  % .",
    "hence , the deviation observed in heat capacity of ti@xmath0v@xmath1 from @xmath28 t + d(t/@xmath18 ) below 100  k is not due to variation in @xmath18 with temperature .",
    "the difference may also arise from the acoustic phonons which show peak structures in the phonon dispersion curves .",
    "these modes act as a einstein oscillators and hence , we have checked for contributions from einstein modes obtained from the phonon dispersion curve reported in literature for vanadium @xcite .",
    "we have observed that for any value of einstein temperature @xmath85 , the value of @xmath18 diverges during fitting .",
    "hence , it appears that the contribution to the heat capacity due to the einstein modes is negligible for the present system . by comparing our results with the literature we found that @xmath86 is observed to follow a temperature dependence such as dt@xmath55ln(t ) @xcite",
    "this is verified by the presence of linearity in @xmath87 as a function of lnt ( inset a to fig 8 . ) .",
    "whenever , t@xmath2 dependence in resistivity is observed , generally the kadowaki - woods relation is checked for its validity .",
    "the inset ( b ) to the figure 8 shows the kadowaki woods plot for ti@xmath0v@xmath1 along with several other spin fluctuations and heavy fermion systems .",
    "surprisingly , the kadowaki - woods relation is observed to be valid in our system .",
    "kadowaki and woods have empirically shown that the coefficient @xmath41 of t@xmath2 term in resistivity scales with the square of the coefficient @xmath28 of electronic specific heat for heavy fermions and spin - fluctuation systems @xcite .",
    "the proportionality constant ( kadowaki - woods ratio , a/@xmath88 ) is found to be about 1 x 10@xmath89-cm ( mol k / mj)@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the coefficient a of the t@xmath2 term in resistivity for the present ti@xmath0v@xmath1 is estimated to be about 5.00(1 ) x 10@xmath90-cm /k2 ( inset to fig . 6 . ) .",
    "the ratio ( a/@xmath88 ) for ti@xmath0v@xmath1 is about 0.60(5 ) x 10@xmath91 @xmath81-cm ( mol k / mj)@xmath2 which is close to the proportionality constant obtained by kadowaki - woods.    we summarize below the important observations made in the present set of experimental results on the normal state of ti@xmath0v@xmath1 alloy .",
    "the temperature dependence of dc susceptibility shows the characteristic `` temperature induced magnetic moment '' and follows @xmath63(t ) = @xmath63(0 ) -bt@xmath2 ln(t / t@xmath65 ) .",
    "the magnetization is linear in h.    \\3 .",
    "resistivity shows a t@xmath2 dependence at low temperatures .",
    "the coefficient of t@xmath5 term in resistivity is negative .",
    "there is an enhancement of sommerfeld coefficient of electronic specific heat @xmath28 .",
    "the excess heat capacity ( @xmath30 c = c - @xmath28 t - d(t/@xmath18 ) ) follows a dt@xmath55ln(t ) temperature dependence .",
    "kadowaki - woods relation is valid in this system .",
    "all these features together have been observed only in pauli enhanced paramagnets such as rco@xmath13(r = y , sc , lu , etc .",
    ", ) @xcite , etc . , where the physical properties have been explained in terms of the existence of itinerant spin fluctuations .",
    "we argue that itinerant spin fluctuations may be present in the ti@xmath0v@xmath1 alloys as well .",
    "we now present a model based on the existence of itinerant spin fluctuations in the ti@xmath0v@xmath1 alloy and show that the observed superconducting properties of the alloy can be explained in this picture . in our understanding ,",
    "the characteristic temperature t@xmath65 = 90  k observed in resistivity is the spin fluctuation temperature t@xmath92 @xcite .",
    "it has been shown by frings and franse that the t@xmath92 may be identified as the temperature at which the second derivative of the susceptibility with respect to temperature is zero @xcite . in the present ti@xmath0v@xmath1 alloy ,",
    "the second derivative of susceptibility goes to zero at t@xmath93 120  k. the t@xmath92 estimated from the straight line fit to data @xmath87 v / s lnt is about 53  k. however , t@xmath92 estimated by resistivity , dc susceptibility and heat capacity are in the same order of magnitude .",
    "variation of t@xmath92 among various experiments to about 2t@xmath92 is not uncommon , and is often found in literature @xcite .",
    "the presence of spin fluctuations in a material can be characterized through the stoner enhancement factor @xcite .",
    "the stoner enhancement factor s is defined as @xmath63(0)/@xmath94 where @xmath63(0 ) is the experimentally observed susceptibility and @xmath94 is the susceptibility due to density of states @xcite . the @xmath94 ( dimensionless ) is given as ( 3/2)@xmath95 = 3@xmath96 where @xmath97 is the permittivity of the free space , @xmath98 is the bohr magneton , @xmath99 is the free electron density , @xmath100 is the fermi energy , and @xmath101 is the boltzmann constant @xcite . the value of s for strong spin fluctuating systems like pd or pt is about 6 @xcite where as the value of s for superconducting nb or v is about 2 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath94 for ti@xmath0v@xmath1 is about 1.57 x 10@xmath25 .",
    "then for ti@xmath0v@xmath1 the value of s = 2.5 , where experimentally observed @xmath63(0 ) = 3.92 x 10@xmath25 ( dimensionless ) .",
    "this value of s is similar to that of v and nb and is much less than that of metals like pt and pd @xcite .",
    "this is also similar to the value of s for mo@xmath8sb@xmath10 system @xcite .    the sommerfeld coefficient of electronic heat capacity @xmath28 enhances due to the presence of spin fluctuations as @xmath28 = @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the sommerfeld coefficient of electronic heat capacity without spin fluctuations .",
    "our results suggest that the spin fluctuations are absent temperatures more than about 100  k. our fit to the heat capacity at temperatures above 100  k provided a value of @xmath28 to be about @xmath104 = 8.06 x 10@xmath29 j / molk@xmath2 whereas the low temperature fit provided a value of @xmath28 to be about @xmath1059.46 x 10@xmath29 j / molk@xmath2 .",
    "then the value of @xmath106 can be estimated as @xmath107 which turns out to be about 0.17 .",
    "the two major effects of the itinerant spin fluctuations on the superconducting properties in the ti@xmath0v@xmath1 alloy are : ( i ) the enhancement of superconducting transition temperature in ti@xmath0v@xmath1 with respect to vanadium , and ( ii ) the origin of the fluctuation conductivity above t@xmath7 and above h@xmath17 .",
    "these effects are discussed below :    \\(i ) the enhancement of superconducting transition temperature in ti@xmath0v@xmath1 with respect to vanadium :    the itinerant spin - fluctuations are reported to be responsible for the absence of superconductivity in heavy transition elements such as palladium and platinum @xcite .",
    "the same formalism was used to suggest that the superconducting transition temperature t@xmath7 of elements such as nb and v is limited by spin - fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the spin fluctuation coupling constant @xmath106 in v is estimated to be about 0.34 @xcite .",
    "then , when non magnetic ti is alloyed with vanadium , there is a reduction in spin fluctuation , hence , t@xmath7 increases in spite of decrease in the free electron density . at very high",
    "content of ti , the t@xmath7 again starts decreasing when the effect of loss of free electron density wins over the effect of reduction of spin fluctuations .",
    "the value of 2 - 3 times t@xmath7 falls in the range of the superconducting transition temperatures of ti - v alloys calculated by estimating the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath108 from band structure calculation ( which is about 12 - 20  k ) @xcite .",
    "hence , we can estimate the @xmath106 for ti@xmath0v@xmath1 by considering the suppression of t@xmath7 from the theoretical limit ( in absence of spin fluctuations ) of about 14.3  k to the experimentally observed value of 7.15  k ( in presence of spin fluctuations ) as described below .",
    "daams et al have shown that the properties of superconductors with spin fluctuations can be scaled to that of a superconductor without spin fluctuation by introducing the renormalized parameters @xmath109 and @xmath110 @xcite . in this formalism , the superconducting transition temperature is given by the modified mcmillan formula @xcite as    @xmath111    where @xmath112(1+@xmath113 and @xmath114 . here",
    ", @xmath115 is the coulomb coupling constant and @xmath106 is the electron - spin fluctuation coupling constant .    using this formalism ,",
    "the @xmath108 and @xmath106 for ti@xmath0v@xmath1 are estimated to be about 0.85 and 0.081 respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath106 estimated in this way is in agreement with that estimated from the enhancement of @xmath28 at low temperatures .",
    "the value of @xmath115 is taken to be 0.1 @xcite .",
    "the other parameters @xmath109 and @xmath110 were estimated to be 0.79 and 0.17 respectively .",
    "these values are used to analyze temperature dependence of h@xmath17 on the basis of formalism by orlando et al @xcite . the solid line in the fig . 3b .",
    ", shows the temperature dependence of h@xmath17 estimated in this manner @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction parameter @xmath116 is estimated to be about 0.3 .",
    "\\(ii ) the origin of the fluctuation conductivity above t@xmath7 and above h@xmath17 :    when vanadium is diluted with the titanium without changing the bcc structure , the spin fluctuations become inhomogeneous in space due to the spatial disorder in vanadium sublattice . in such a case",
    "electron spin - fluctuation coupling constant @xmath106 is expected to vary in space over the sample volume .",
    "this is similar to the disordered kondo lattice with spatial distribution of kondo temperatures t@xmath117 s @xcite leading to inhomogeneous short range conduction electron polarization which in turn results in the itinerant spin fluctuations . since , the mobility of the conduction electrons are large , the life time of these spin fluctuations decreases leading to the small spin fluctuation coupling constant @xmath106 of about 0.081 in the ti@xmath0v@xmath1 alloy .",
    "our conjecture about the itinerant nature of the spin fluctuations is also supported by the fact that there is no significant magnetic field dependence of physical properties above 20  k , where the signature of the existence of spin fluctuations are observed in the ti@xmath0v@xmath1 alloy @xcite .",
    "since the itinerant spin fluctuations are weakly dependent on the magnetic field , the @xmath118 dependence of the ( negative ) magneto - resistance is absent in ti@xmath0v@xmath1 .",
    "the temperature and magnetic field dependent dc magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity and the zero field heat capacity of ti@xmath0v@xmath1 have been analyzed in a quantitative manner .",
    "these results provide some experimental evidences of the presence of spin - fluctuations in this alloy system .",
    "the kadowaki - woods scaling is shown to be valid for the ti@xmath0v@xmath1 alloy .",
    "we have argued that the spin fluctuations present in ti@xmath0v@xmath1 alloy are itinerant in nature .",
    "the onset of superconductivity is suppressed in ti@xmath0v@xmath1 from its expected theoretical limit due to the presence of such spin - fluctuations while the distribution of @xmath106 induces the superconducting fluctuation above t@xmath7 .",
    "there are some indications based on the present study of the existence of preformed cooper - pairs in the temperature range well above the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "the present study suggests that the interesting correlations between spin - fluctuations and superconductivity may not necessarily be the properties of only certain classes of exotic compounds .",
    "relatively simple alloy systems like ti@xmath0v@xmath1 shows such interesting correlations . a complete understanding of the normal state and superconducting properties of this technologically important alloy system ti - v would help in tuning its properties for suitable technological applications .",
