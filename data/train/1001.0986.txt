    "since the pioneering works by bloch , zener and wannier on the coherent electron dynamics in biased crystalline solids @xcite , it is well established that quantum particles in periodic potentials subjected to an external force do not delocalize but undergo a high - frequency oscillatory motion known as a bloch oscillation ( bo ) .",
    "tunneling to higher - order bands , referred to as zener tunneling ( zt ) and observed for a strong external bias , is responsible for bo damping and broadening of wannier - stark resonances .",
    "owing to detrimental dephasing and many - body effects , the experimental verification of bos failed for many decades . nowadays",
    "bos are considered a rather universal wavy phenomenon and their observation has been reported in different physical systems for both quantum particles and classical waves . in the quantum realm , bos have been observed for electrons in biased semiconductor superlattices @xcite and for bose - einstein condensates in accelerating optical lattices @xcite .",
    "classical analogues of bos , based on interference effects of classical waves in periodic media , have been proposed and experimentally observed using either optical @xcite or acoustical @xcite waves .",
    "optical bos in artificial materials or at the nanoscale have been also recently predicted @xcite . among various photonic structures , arrays of coupled waveguides with transverse refractive index gradients",
    "have provided an extremely rich laboratory tool to visualize the classical wave optic analogues of bos @xcite and related phenomena , such as the coherent superposition of bos and zt ( the so - called bloch - zener oscillations @xcite ) occurring in binary structures and recently observed in circularly - curved femtosecond - laser - written waveguide arrays @xcite . in another physical context ,",
    "application of bloch - zener oscillations to matter - wave interferometry has been also proposed @xcite . while there has been a lot of interest in the propagation of light waves in complex photonic structures like lattices and superlattices , quasi - crystals , and even random lattices",
    ", most of previous works focused on propagation of classical light and used the photonic structures as classical simulators of electronic or matter wave systems in periodic or random potentials .",
    "however , it is known that coupled waveguides behave similarly to beam splitters ( see , for instance , @xcite ) and may therefore show quantum interference effects when probed with nonclassical light .",
    "demonstration of key quantum effects of nonclassical light in silicon - based based waveguide circuits has been recently reported in ref.@xcite . as shown in recent works @xcite , nonclassical light consisting of only particle - like quanta propagating in waveguide arrays with a superimposed transverse refractive index gradient",
    "can also produce optical bos .",
    "remarkably , in addition to classical wave bragg scattering the quantum nature of light introduces new quantum interference effects .",
    "in particular , two - photon hong - ou - mandel quantum interference @xcite has been predicted for pairs of correlated photons undergoing bloch - zener oscillations in binary arrays . here",
    "zt periodically mixes photons belonging to the two minibands of the array and thus acts like a beam splitter @xcite .",
    "recently , quantum correlations of photon pairs undergoing discrete diffraction in homogeneous arrays have been investigated as well , and their classical counterpart has been experimentally observed in hanbury brown - twiss intensity correlation measurements @xcite .",
    "the investigation of quantum interference effects in complex photonic structures such as homogeneous , inhomogeneous or even random photonic lattices has two main motivations . on the one hand",
    ", they may offer the possibility of engineering photon entanglement and of transporting nonclassical light @xcite ; on the other hand , they enable to utilize optical - quantum analogies in the opposite direction , i.e. trying to observe quantum version of classical wave phenomena ( such as the analogue of the talbot effect in the second quantized setup @xcite ) . + it is the aim of this work to provide a comprehensive analysis of classical and quantum interference of light undergoing bos in inhomogeneous waveguide arrays in the regime of multiband excitation and negligible zt , i.e. in a complementary regime of that previously considered in refs.@xcite . in spite of the absence of interband transitions",
    ", it is shown that mach - zehnder - like interference effects do spontaneously occur for a multiband excitation of the array at the input plane . in this regime ,",
    "the input beam breaks up into two ( or more ) wave packets belonging to different bands of the array which follow distinct paths in the real space and recombine after a full bo cycle .",
    "wave and photon interference effects after a full bo cycle may be thus observed by classical and nonclassical light illumination , even in absence of zt . in particular , it is shown that array excitation with correlated photon pairs tilted at the bragg angles enables to observe quantum interference patterns in two - photon correlation measurements analogous to those occurring in quantum mach - zehnder interferometry as a manifestation of the de broglie wavelength of entangled photon states @xcite .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is provided by a rather standard wave optics model describing bos of monochromatic light waves at carrier frequency @xmath0 propagating in a weakling guiding one - dimensional waveguide array [ fig.1(a ) ] , with a periodic refractive index profile @xmath1 and with a superimposed transverse refractive index gradient @xmath2 @xcite . in the paraxial approximation ,",
