    "since the discovery of high-@xmath1 superconductors , the nature of the mixed state in a type ii superconductor has been a focus of theoretical and experimental investigation . in many high-@xmath1 materials , thermal fluctuations are responsible for the melting of the vortex lattice phase predicted by the mean field theory @xcite into a vortex liquid phase .",
    "the presence of quenched random impurities in the vortex liquid or lattice phases also plays an important role , since it presents a possibility of a dissipation - free current flow due to pinning of flux lines .",
    "new theoretical phases such as the vortex glass phase @xcite for point defects and the bose glass phase @xcite in the presence of extended defects have been proposed . as shown by larkin and ovchinnikov ( lo )",
    "@xcite the quenched point disorder destroys , for spatial dimension @xmath2 , the long - range crystalline order of the vortex lattice .",
    "the system is described by some characteristic length scale @xmath0 over which a short - range translational order exists .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we developed a nonperturbative scheme to calculate the structure factor of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) vortex liquid in the absence of random impurities .",
    "the main ingredient of this nonperturbative method was the resummation of an infinite subset of feynman diagrams contributing to the structure factor , the so - called parquet graphs @xcite .",
    "this is an analytic approach to 2d vortex liquid system which is sophisticated enough to predict growing crystalline order in the system as the temperature is lowered .",
    "the growth of the translational order was investigated in connection with the sharp peaks developing in the liquid structure factor . within this scheme , we found no evidence for a finite temperature phase transition into the vortex lattice phase and the system remains as a liquid .",
    "the length scale , @xmath0 , characterizing this growing translational order seemed to diverge only in the zero temperature limit .    in this paper",
    ", we give detailed derivations of the parquet graph resummation technique which were omitted in the previous paper @xcite .",
    "in addition , we present a new simplified version of the parquet equations governing the structure factor , which were given in terms of a set of _ coupled _ nonlinear integral equations previously . in the present work",
    ", we were able to obtain one simple equation for the structure factor , which contains all the nonperturbative information for the 2d vortex liquid in the absence of disorder .    in this paper",
    ", we also apply the parquet graph resummation technique to the 2d vortex liquid in the presence of quenched disorder .",
    "we find that the sharp peaks which appeared in the structure factor of the pure system become broadened as the strength of the disorder increases .",
    "this is entirely consistent with one s intuition that in the presence of disorder the length scale @xmath0 describing the translational order becomes smaller as compared to the pure case . in the present work ,",
    "since our pure system is always in the liquid phase , the effect of disorder appears as smooth deviations from the pure case . from the nonperturbative results , we find the temperature dependence of the length scale @xmath0 .",
    "it is , however , difficult to make any connection between our results and the lo type argument , since there exists no vortex lattice phase at any finite temperature within our nonperturbative scheme , while the lo argument always starts from the vortex lattice with a true long - range crystalline order .",
    "we note that there exist recent theoretical studies @xcite based on the elastic theory of pinned lattices suggesting that the pinning by quenched disorder become less effective due to the periodicity of the lattice so that a quasi long - range order persist beyond the larkin length scale @xmath0 . in the present nonperturbative analysis , the existence of such quasi long - range translational order has not been observed .",
    "the point whether the 2d vortex liquid in the absence of disorder undergoes a finite temperature phase transition into a 2d vortex lattice is still controversial .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite seem to suggest a first - order phase transition . however , as shown in ref .  , these results depend cruicially on boundary conditions . in a spherical geometry ,",
    "the authors of ref .   demonstrated the absence of a finite temperature phase transition .",
    "there also exists a recent experiment @xcite performed on a sample with very weak pinning , where no sign of a phase transition is detected .",
    "the present parquet approximation , which is an analytic theory on an infinite plane , seems to support the absence of a finite temperature phase transition between 2d vortex liquid and solid .",
    "unlike the 2d system , it is generally believed that a 3d vortex liquid undergoes a first - order phase transition into a vortex lattice .",
    "an experiment by zeldov _",
    "@xcite on bscco has been accepted as a convincing evidence for the transition .",
    "however , there exists a recent claim @xcite that the results of ref .   might be an artifact due to a particular sample geometry .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting if one could develop a three - dimensional parquet graph resummation scheme and obtain nonperturbative information on the 3d vortex liquid system .",
    "we find that one can generalize the parquet equations to three dimensions without difficulty .",
    "unfortunately , the equations become very complicated and we were not able to obtain a numerical solution to the 3d parquet equations .    in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the structure factor of a two - dimensional disordered vortex liquid within the ginzburg - landau theory . in secs .",

    ", we argued that an ansatz like @xmath265 was not enough to produce any useful nonperturbative information for the three dimensional solution .",
    "we believe that finding appropriate low temperature asymptotic forms for the vertex functions is a first step towards a more fruitful use of the parquet equations . to this end , a simple equation like ( [ main : pure ] ) might be useful .",
    "the effect of random impurities on the mixed state of a type - ii superconductor is usually described by the so - called larkin - ovchinnikov argument @xcite , which states that for a dimension @xmath2 the long - range crystalline order of the mixed state is destroyed by a weak disorder . for thin films ( @xmath266 )",
    ", one can estimate the larkin length scale @xmath0 over which a short - range order persists as @xcite @xmath267 .",
    "although the @xmath199-dependence of @xmath0 is the same as the present result , we note that there is a basic difference between our result and the lo type argument .",
    "since the lo argument starts from a perfect crystalline state where @xmath268 , a very small amount of disorder makes an abrupt change as can be seen from @xmath269- dependence of @xmath0 . within the parquet approximation ,",
    "there is no 2d crystalline phase and the pure system has a finite @xmath0 at any finite temperature .",
    "as we have seen in the previous sections , the effect of small disorder is represented as a smooth decrease of this length scale .    in this paper , we have concentrated on a rotationally symmetric liquid state where the vertex functions depend only on the magnitude of @xmath53 .",
    "but , for example , in the presence of magnetoelastic interactions between vortices , one must consider general @xmath53-dependent vertex functions in the parquet equations .",
    "we recall that the input parameters of the parquet equations are the temperature and the bare vertex functions , @xmath270 and @xmath271",
