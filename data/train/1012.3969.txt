    "the accurate _ ab initio _ treatment of many - body effects in the ground and excited states of solids remains a challenging problem in physics . for the ground - state ( gs )",
    "properties of periodic systems reliable _ ab initio _ methods are at present available .",
    "two different formalisms can be distinguished : approaches based on kohn - sham ( ks ) density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite and methods which rest on explicitly computing many - body wave functions ( wf s ) @xcite , by means of quantum chemical techniques @xcite .",
    "the accuracy achieved by the two types of methods for the gs properties is often comparable . for the case of energy bands and excited states , however , the results obtained by ks - dft and wf - based approaches are different .",
    "although dft formally is a gs theory , it has been commonly employed in the computation of energy bands , i.e. , excited states , and in some cases yields surprisingly good results , e.g. , when hybrid density functionals or exact exchange schemes are utilized .",
    "nevertheless , a rigorous justification for assigning the ks eigenvalues or ks energy differences to excitation or quasiparticle energies of correlated electron systems is still to be given .",
    "since there is no solid basis for such an extension of gs ks - dft , when inaccurate or wrong excitation energies are obtained , they can not be improved in a systematic and controlled manner . the widely used local density ( lda )",
    "@xcite and generalized gradient approximations ( gga ) @xcite to the ks - dft provide a rather poor description for binding energies and band gaps of semiconductors and insulators . the self - interaction error introduced with the lda or gga potential and the absence of discontinuity in the exchange potential",
    "have been identified as the main reasons for that .",
    "the incomplete cancellation of the self - interaction in lda or gga is also regarded as a major cause for the underestimation of the binding energies of  semicore \" @xmath6 states in systems such as the ii@xmath7-vi@xmath8 semiconductors @xcite .",
    "an accurate _ ab initio _ description of the electronic structure of these seemingly conventional @xmath9 semiconductors has appeared to be a rather difficult task .",
    "numerous refinements of ks - dft have been suggested to enable the treatment of many - body effects in correlated electron systems .",
    "many - body corrections to the ks mean - field eigenvalues as obtained within the @xmath4 approximation @xcite to the self - energy often yield good agreement between theory and experiment with respect to the band gaps of various group - iv and iii - v semiconductors .",
    "the @xmath4 approximation is established as the standard method for calculating quasiparticle energy bands in those materials .",
    "it does fail , however , to describe complex many - body effects in @xmath6-electron systems such as the ii@xmath7-vi@xmath8 compounds @xcite .",
    "the quasiparticle energies of the @xmath6 states , for example , are about 2.0 ev higher than the experimental values @xcite .",
    "this result remains the same when the mean - field lda+__u _",
    "_ @xcite hamiltonian is utilized @xcite as a basis for the @xmath4 treatment .",
    "quasiparticle energies are supposed to be independent of the starting mean - field solution . ]",
    "the problems were attributed to the self - interaction errors , still present in the standard @xmath4 approximation @xcite .    it has been argued that determining self - consistently the optimum mean - field hamiltonian rather than utilizing the lda ( + _ _ u _ _ ) would largely improve the description of quasiparticles within the @xmath4 approximation @xcite .",
    "indeed , the self - consistent @xmath4 method of kotani _ et al . _ @xcite yields in the ii@xmath7-vi@xmath8 and iii@xmath7-v@xmath8 compounds @xmath6-state quasiparticle energies in good agreement with experimental values , i.e. , deviations of at most 0.8 ev are observed . yet , the approach overestimates systematically , although by little , the band gaps .",
    "this was attributed to the lack of excitonic effects in the dielectric function .",
    "methods which treat the exchange energy within the exact exchange ( exx ) scheme and are thus considered to be self - interaction free have been developed as well .",
    "for example , the full - potential exx ks - dft calculations of sharma _ et al . _",
    "@xcite including core - valence exchange interactions yield very good agreement with the experiment for the binding energies of @xmath6 electrons in zns .",
    "the band gaps of the ii@xmath7-vi@xmath8 compounds and other @xmath9 semiconductors , such as si , ge , and gaas , are , however , largely overestimated in that computational scheme .",
    "this trend is reversed in insulating compounds such as bn , c and some nobel gas solids , where the gaps are underestimated @xcite . excluding the core - valence exchange interaction , on the other hand ,",
    "brings the band gaps close to experimental estimates , but it simultaneously worsens the binding energies .",
    "exx calculations within the pseudopotential framework yield band gaps and cohesive properties of various @xmath9 semiconductors in very good agreement with the experiment @xcite .",
    "the binding energies of the @xmath6 states , however , remain wrong in such a treatment @xcite . a different approach to energy bands in periodic systems",
    "is based on _ ab initio _ wf methods .",
    "their major virtue is the use of well - defined and controllable approximations",
    ". converged results for binding energies , lattice parameters , and band gaps can be here achieved by systematic improvement of the many - body wave function @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of those formalisms is the larger amount of work involved as compared to the dft - based calculations .",
    "the large computational effort is related to the physics of the problem . when an electron is added to a conduction - band or removed from a valence - band state of a semiconductor or insulator",
    ", the correlation hole of the extra particle ( hole ) is long - ranged because of polarization and relaxation effects .",
    "the corresponding quasiparticle , i.e. , the particle plus its correlation hole , is moving in form of a bloch wave through the system .",
    "the computation of the energy dispersion associated with the quasiparticle requires an accurate description of the correlation hole .",
    "the latter differs considerably from the correlation hole of an electron in the ground state for which the correlations are of van der waals type and do not involve long - range ( lr ) polarizations .",
    "the different nature of the correlation holes in the ground- and ( @xmath10 ) states is simply ignored in the dft methods and hence the large computational effort is avoided .",
    "taking into account this difference is essential for the correct determination of energy bands and gaps .",
    "in contrast to ground - state calculations @xcite , energy band calculations based on quantum chemical methods are still limited to non - metalic systems @xcite .",
    "they rest either on second - order mller - plesset theory ( mp2 ) @xcite , coupled - cluster ( cc ) techniques @xcite or effective local hamiltonian ( lh ) @xcite approaches .",
    "some of these formalisms make use of the local character of the short - range part of the correlation hole @xcite , utilizing thereby local operators @xcite related to sets of real - space , localized orbitals .",
    "the localized orbitals are either derived by means of various localization procedures @xcite applied to the canonical bloch orbitals of the self - consistent - field ( scf ) gs wave function @xcite or obtained directly from a crystal hartree - fock @xcite calculation carried out in the wannier representation @xcite .",
    "the local orbital schemes of pulay and saeb@xmath11 utilized in local mller - plesset and coupled - electron - pair correlation approaches to finite systems @xcite have also been adopted for deriving local orbitals for crystalline compounds , see , e.g. , ref .  .    in the present study",
    ", we compute the correlation - induced corrections to the hf valence and conduction energy bands of @xmath12-zns , a representative of the the ii@xmath7-vi@xmath8 compounds .",
    "there is much interest toward the electronic structure and properties of the ii@xmath7-vi@xmath8 systems due to their optical properties @xcite and potential exploitation in optoelectronic devices and medical instrumentation .",
    "for example , thin films of these materials grown on substrates of gaas give rise to interfaces emitting intensive white light , i.e. , semiconductor - based light emitting devices @xcite .",
    "moreover , some properties of mixed phases of the type zns@xmath13se@xmath14 such as the width of the fundamental band gap may be continuously tuned depending on the explicit @xmath15 value @xcite .",
    "the goal of these wf - based investigations is twofold . on one hand",
    ", we extend the area of applicability of the wf - based band structure calculations , building on previous investigations performed for the simpler compounds mgo @xcite and bn @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , our study attempts to provide new insight into the many - body effects which operate in this specific @xmath2 electron system .",
    "of particular interest are the binding energies of the  semicore \" zn 3@xmath6 states since their accurate treatment remains out of reach for standard dft and @xmath4 methods , see refs .  ,   and the discussion above .",
    "hf calculations carried out within the linear - combination - of - atomic orbital method @xcite or the full - potential linear - muffin - tin - orbitals approach @xcite overestimate as well , by about 3 - 5 ev , the binding energies of @xmath6 states in ii@xmath7-vi@xmath16 and iii@xmath16-v@xmath16 semiconductors .",

    "the contributions arising from such csf s to the sdci correlation energies are related to effects beyond the loss of ground - state correlation and the quasiparticle picture . in the calculation of the loss of ground - state correlations",

    "the correlation contribution associated with the singly external configurations , 0.54 ev , has been thus discarded from the computation of loss of ground - state correlations . to deduce the loss of ground - state correlations we utilized for the @xmath19 and s @xmath3 ( @xmath23 ) states the dominant correlation contributions due to doubly external configurations .",
    "we found a correction of 0.82 ev to the s @xmath3 band states , see table [ diagonalhole ] .",

    "this extra contribution is mainly due to excited doubly external configurations , about 0.70 ev , but singly external configurations involving the single electron give rise to a relevant fraction of about 0.27 ev .",
    "we note that the virtual orbitals to which the extra electron is excited in the singly external configurations with largest ci coefficients have much weight at the four nn s ions .",
    "this extra differential contribution of 0.97 ev stabilizes the ( @xmath22 ) electron state with respect to the @xmath19-electron state by 0.84 ev .",

    "<S> , we show that for the accurate description of the zn @xmath2 states a correlation treatment based on wave function methods is needed . </S>",
    "<S> our study rests on a local hamiltonian approach which rigorously describes the short - range polarization and charge redistribution effects around an extra hole or electron placed into the valence respective conduction bands of semiconductors and insulators . </S>",
    "<S> the method also facilitates the computation of electron correlation effects beyond relaxation and polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the electron correlation treatment is performed on finite clusters cut off the infinite system . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism makes use of localized wannier functions and embedding potentials derived explicitly from prior periodic hartree - fock calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the on - site and nearest - neighbor charge relaxation lead to corrections of several ev to the hartree - fock band energies and gap . </S>",
    "<S> corrections due to long - range polarization are of the order of 1.0 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion of the hartree - fock bands is only little affected by electron correlations . </S>",
    "<S> we find the zn @xmath2  semicore \" states to lie about 9.0 ev below the top of the s @xmath3 valence bands , in very good agreement with values from valence - band x - ray photoemission . </S>"
