    "one of the essential unit operations in micro - total - analysis - systems ( @xmath0tas ) is the separation of species for downstream analysis .",
    "early microfluidic separation strategies involved miniaturization of different macroscopic separation methods , e.g. , size exclusion @xcite and hydrodynamic chromatography @xcite . however , current micro - fabrication techniques enable design and fabrication of precisely controlled micro - structures to act as separation media , in contrast with the random micro - structure common in conventional separation media .",
    "for example , ` entropic trapping ' a channel with alternating thick and thin regions was used to separate dna molecules by size based on the time time they spend in the entropic traps ( thick regions ) @xcite . in ` pinched flow fractionation ' , species entering a constriction and exiting into a sudden expansion experience a lateral displacement from their trajectories that is a function of their size @xcite . ` deterministic lateral displacement ' ( dld ) employs a periodic array of solid obstacles , through which species of different sizes migrate in different spatial directions in the presence of the same driving force @xcite .",
    "this effect can also be achieved with a periodic array of optical traps ( soft potentials instead of solid obstacles , @xcite ) . although dld systems have been studied extensively @xcite , the understanding of the underlying mechanism is presented only heuristically , and lacks a theoretical framework for their analysis .",
    "we have performed numerous detailed computational and experimental studies of dld - like systems @xcite  where the experiments include microfluidic as well as macroscopic platforms at low reynolds number  and have established that _ directional locking _ dictates the particle trajectories in such systems . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the mechanism underlying separations in the dld systems . specifically , we present a theoretical analysis of dld systems , involving the motion of a particle of arbitrary radius in a square array of obstacles of circular cross - section .",
    "we assume a ` dilute limit ' for the obstacles , such that the inter - obstacle spacing is sufficiently large and a particle interacts with a single obstacle at a time . the field driving the particle ( either a constant force , or a flow field )",
    "is assumed to be at an arbitrary angle ( henceforth , forcing angle ) with respect to the principal lattice directions of the square array .",
    "we assume negligible particle as well as fluid inertia , and infinite pclet number ( non - brownian particles , deterministic trajectories ) .",
    "we show that , under the dilute approximation , the particle - obstacle interaction can be replaced by a point particle moving in straight lines past an obstacle with an effective radius equal to the critical offset .",
    "the critical offset is the offset at which particle - obstacles collisions become irreversible and can be interpreted as a length - scale that characterizes the effect of short - range repulsive non - hydrodynamic interactions between the particles and the obstacles .",
    "( previous work presents a detailed discussion of the critical offset , both computationally @xcite as well as theoretically @xcite ) . using this equivalent representation of the system under the dilute approximation",
    ", the problem of calculating the particle trajectories reduces to simple geometric manipulations .",
    "we derive a periodicity criterion for particle trajectories in terms of the design parameters of the system , namely , the critical offset , the forcing angle , and the inter - obstacle spacing in the square array .",
    "the periodicity criterion yields the experimentally and computationally observed directional locking behavior .",
    "further , we show that the same framework can be used to uncover size - based spatial band - pass filtering of particles through the array , such that particles of a certain intermediate size migrate with an average migration angle larger than that corresponding to smaller as well as larger particles .    the article is organized as follows : in  [ sec : sysdefdld ] we introduce the system under consideration , the system variables , and the dilute approximation .",
    "we also explain the model for short - range repulsive non - hydrodynamic interactions leading to the definition of the critical parameter @xmath1 , and establish an abstract model for the particle - obstacle pair . in  [ sec : dirlock ] , we use the abstract model to derive a periodicity condition for particle trajectories .",
    "we apply the periodicity condition to derive expressions for the simplest locking directions in  [ subsubsec : firstlockdirp ] and  [ subsubsec : lastlockdirq ] . in  [ sec : designrules ] , we use the periodicity condition corresponding to particles exhibiting the simplest directional locking behavior , and comment on the resolution of separation between such particles .",
    "figure [ fig : systemgeometrydld ] depicts the system under investigation .",
    "we consider a suspended spherical particle of radius @xmath2 negotiating a square array of obstacles with circular cross section of radius @xmath3 , under the action of a driving field @xmath4 ( either a constant force , or a uniform flow away from the lattice ) .",
    "the field is oriented at an angle @xmath5 with respect to one of the principal axes of the array ( say , the @xmath6-axis as shown in the figure ) .",
    "the lattice spacing is @xmath7 .",
    "the domain of the ` forcing angle ' is restricted to @xmath8 $ ] , since the system possesses a reflection symmetry in the @xmath9 line .",
    "we work in the ` stokes regime ' , i.e. , we neglect fluid inertia ( vanishingly small reynolds number ) and particle inertia ( vanishingly small stokes number ) .",
    "we consider the deterministic limit ( infinitely large pclet number , non - brownian limit ) .",
    "further , in dld micro - devices , the enclosing walls perpendicular to the @xmath10-axis ( i.e. , walls parallel to the plane of the paper ) screen the hydrodynamic interactions between the particle and distant obstacles .",
    "therefore , we assume that the lattice spacing @xmath7 is sufficiently larger than the @xmath10-spacing between the walls , such that , to a good approximation we can consider the interaction between the particle and only the closest obstacle ( figure [ fig : comparedilutetoexact ] , dilute approximation ) .",
    "figure [ fig : comparedilutetoexact ] depicts the variables of the problem ; the incoming and outgoing offsets are denoted by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . the dimensionless minimum surface - to - surface separation attained by the particle from the obstacle",
    "is denoted by @xmath13 in the figure .",
    "the functional relationship between @xmath11 and @xmath13 explicitly incorporates the hydrodynamic mobility of the particle around the fixed obstacle , thereby taking into consideration the hydrodynamic interactions @xcite .",
    "apart from the hydrodynamic interactions between the particle and the obstacle that arise from their finite size , we also take into account the effect of short - range repulsive non - hydrodynamic interactions such as solid - solid contact due to surface roughness , electrostatic repulsion , steric repulsion , etc .",
    "a simple and effective model for these non - hydrodynamic interactions is to treat them as leading to a hard - wall potential with a given dimensionless range @xmath14 , such that it creates a hard shell around the obstacle and the particle surface can not approach the obstacle surface closer than @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "we have shown elsewhere that the presence of such non - hydrodynamic repulsion leads to the occurrence of a critical offset @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this can be further elaborated with the aid of figure [ fig : threetrajandabstraction](a ) . as shown ,",
    "the particle trajectories can be categorized as follows ( from top to bottom ) : ( a ) the trajectories for which @xmath15 . in this case , the particle motion is unaffected by the presence of the non - hydrodynamic interactions , ( b ) the trajectory that corresponds to @xmath16 . in this case , the particle ` grazes ' the obstacle and defines the _ critical trajectory _ , and ( c ) the trajectories that would correspond to @xmath17 in the absence of non - hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "however , in this case , the particles are forced to circumnavigate the obstacle by maintaining a constant separation equal to @xmath14 on the approaching side due to the hard - core potential .",
    "the last group of trajectories collapse onto the critical trajectory downstream of the obstacle , breaking their fore - aft symmetry .",
    "thus , the critical trajectory ( of type ( b ) described above ) defines the critical offset as @xmath18 , such that the corresponding minimum separation is the range of the non - hydrodynamic interactions ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) .",
    "therefore , in the presence of short - range repulsive non - hydrodynamic interactions , the relationship between @xmath11 and @xmath13 is equivalent to the relationship between the critical offset @xmath1 and the range of the interactions @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "three kinds of particle trajectories in the presence of short - range repulsive non - hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "( b ) depiction of the equivalent system in which a point - particle traverses past an obstacle of radius @xmath1 ( effective radius ) . the outgoing part of the trajectories with @xmath20 is tangent to the obstacle in the equivalent system . ]    using the hard - wall model for the non - hydrodynamic interactions combined with the dilute assumption , we can thus replace the physical particle - obstacle system with an equivalent abstract system shown in figure [ fig : threetrajandabstraction](b ) . the obstacle radius @xmath3 can be replaced by @xmath1 and the particle can be reduced to a point particle .",
    "as shown , since the particle trajectories with incoming impact parameter @xmath21 remain fore - aft symmetric , one can replace them with straight lines uninfluenced by the obstacle .",
    "the trajectories with @xmath20 ( that would intersect the new , abstract obstacle ) , get laterally displaced by @xmath22 , and continue as tangents to the obstacle parallel to the forcing direction .",
    "it is interesting to note that both the hydrodynamic as well as non - hydrodynamic interactions are incorporated in the single parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the defining feature of deterministic lateral displacement is directional locking of particle trajectories ( see figure [ fig : systemgeometrydld](b ) ) . in a square array of obstacles ( e.g. , dld devices )",
    ", the particle follows a periodic trajectory with a periodicity of ( say ) @xmath23 lattice units in @xmath6-direction and @xmath24 lattice units in @xmath25-direction for a range of values of @xmath5 , and some integers @xmath23 & @xmath24 .",
    "in such a case , the trajectory is said to be locked in the @xmath26 $ ] direction for that range of values of @xmath5 .",
    "the migration angle @xmath27 is defined by , @xmath28    equipped with the abstraction of the particle - obstacle pair described in the previous section , we now consider a square array of such obstacles with radius @xmath1 , separated by the lattice spacing @xmath7 . figure [ fig : deriveschematic ] shows a schematic of the equivalent system with straight - line trajectories between two successive particle - obstacle collisions that occur @xmath23 lattice units apart in @xmath6-direction and @xmath24 lattice units apart in @xmath25-direction , thereby representing a @xmath29$]-periodic trajectory .",
    "the figure shows two coordinate systems , the @xmath30-system with its axes parallel to the principal axes of the lattice as well as the @xmath31-system with @xmath32-axis parallel to the direction of the driving field @xmath4 .",
    "since we have a point - particle traversing in a straight line parallel to the direction of the driving field , it is evident that a particle - obstacle interaction ( a ` collision ' ) is possible only if the particle trajectory intersects the obstacle , i.e. , only if the distance @xmath33 to the obstacle center from the trajectory is less than the obstacle radius .",
    "note that , as shown in figure [ fig : deriveschematic ] , @xmath33 is the same as the initial offset @xmath11 for the corresponding obstacle .",
    "it is evident that there are only two kinds of collisions with respect to the sign of the @xmath34-coordinate of the point of collision , _ top _",
    "( @xmath35 ) and _ bottom _ ( @xmath36 ) ones .",
    "therefore , a given periodic trajectory , can exhibit periodicity in exactly three distinct modes : ( a ) all successive collisions satisfy @xmath37 ( _ top - top collisions _",
    ", figure [ fig : deriveschematic](a ) ) , ( b ) all successive collisions satisfy @xmath38 ( _ bottom - bottom collisions _ , figure [ fig : deriveschematic](b ) ) , or ( c ) collisions alternately satisfy @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( _ top - bottom - top collisions _ or equivalently , _ bottom - top - bottom collisions _ figure [ fig : deriveschematic](c ) )    as shown in figure [ fig : deriveschematic ] , we choose an arbitrary obstacle , which has undergone a collision , as the origin of the @xmath30-system . in the case of top - top and bottom - bottom collisions ( figure [ fig : deriveschematic](a ) and ( b ) ) , we assume that the period is @xmath23 in @xmath6-direction , and @xmath24 in @xmath25-direction , for some integers @xmath39 . hence the coordinates of the center of the next obstacle are ( @xmath40 ) in figures [ fig : deriveschematic](a ) and ( b ) . in the case of periodic trajectories arising from top - bottom - top ( equivalently , bottom - top - bottom ) collisions ( figure [ fig : deriveschematic](c ) ) , we assume that @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the alternate periods in @xmath6-direction , while @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the periods in @xmath25-direction , again , for some integers @xmath45 .          for a top - top collision ,",
    "the equation of the trajectory in the @xmath30-system is , @xmath46 since the center of the next obstacle , ( @xmath40 ) , lies in the lower half - plane of the trajectory , it satisfies @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the normal distance between the obstacle center and the trajectory in the case of top - top collisions is , @xmath48 for a top - top collision , in the @xmath31-system centered on the second obstacle , the initial offset must satisfy @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , ( [ eqn : dtoptop ] ) yields , @xmath50 .",
    "this inequality can be rephrased as , @xmath51 where , @xmath52\\right)=\\sqrt{p^2+q^2}$ ] .",
    "a similar procedure for bottom - bottom collisions dictates that the trajectory is described by @xmath53 the obstacle center ( @xmath40 ) , lies in the upper half - plane of the trajectory satisfying @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , @xmath55 the bounds on @xmath11 in @xmath31-system dictate , @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , ( [ eqn : dbotbot ] ) becomes , @xmath57 .",
    "the latter can be rearranged to , @xmath58 where , @xmath52\\right)=\\sqrt{p^2+q^2}$ ] .",
    "for top - bottom - top collisions leading to periodicity , we can similarly arrive at @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the first ( top - bottom ) and the second ( bottom - top ) collisions , respectively .",
    "since these always occur successively in a periodic trajectory , we can add the two inequalities to yield , @xmath61 using the total periodiciy @xmath29 = [ p_1+p_2,q_1+q_2]$ ] and @xmath62 as defined earlier , the above inequality can be rearranged to take a form similar to ( [ eqn : dtoptopcondn ] ) or ( [ eqn : dbotbotcondn ] ) : @xmath63    in the above double - inequalities , only one side becomes relevant depending on the relative magnitudes of @xmath5 and @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath64 we have @xmath65 , and inequality ( [ eqn : dtoptopcondn ] ) is relevant , whereas in the case of @xmath66 , the inequality ( [ eqn : dbotbotcondn ] ) is the appropriate choice .",
    "thus , ( [ eqn : dtoptopcondn ] ) and ( [ eqn : dbotbotcondn ] ) together describe the periodic behavior of the particle trajectories in the lattice . both can be combined into a single inequality as , @xmath67 we observe that the values of @xmath5 satisfying the inequality ( [ eqn : universalineq ] ) are symmetric about @xmath68 . which means , if @xmath69 and @xmath70 satisfy the _",
    "equalities _ corresponding to ( [ eqn : dtoptopcondn ] ) and ( [ eqn : dbotbotcondn ] ) , respectively , then @xmath71 further , note that ( [ eqn : dtoptopcondn ] ) and ( [ eqn : dbotbotcondn ] ) are _ necessary conditions _ for periodicity of a trajectory in a strict mathematical sense , but they are not sufficient conditions . which means , _ if _ a trajectory is known to exhibit @xmath29$]-locking , _ then _ the pair @xmath29 $ ] must satisfy ( [ eqn : dtoptopcondn ] ) or ( [ eqn : dbotbotcondn ] ) depending upon the relative magnitudes of @xmath27 and @xmath5 .",
    "conversely , there may exist many integer pairs @xmath29 $ ] which satisfy ( [ eqn : dtoptopcondn ] ) or ( [ eqn : dbotbotcondn ] ) , for a given forcing angle @xmath5 and parameters @xmath1 and @xmath7 .",

    "the same figure also shows an agreement between data from microfluidic experiments @xcite and theory ( the ratio @xmath81 corresponding to the experimental data shown in the figure is approximately equal to that used in theoretical calculations ) .    ) versus forcing direction ( @xmath82 ) portraying devil s staircase - like structure representing directional locking .",
    "the empty circles represent individual particle - particle simulations under the dilute approximation , the line represents the solution of ( [ eqn : universalineq ] ) , @xmath29 $ ] , such that the integer pair @xmath29 $ ] is the closest integer pair to @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "the filled circles with error bars correspond to the data from microfluidic experiments @xcite .",
    "the dashed line represents the @xmath83-@xmath83-line dividing the plane in the regions with @xmath84 ( the region above the line ) and @xmath85 ( the region below the line ) as shown .",

    "the transition - forcing - angles from one locked migration direction to the next as well as the migration angle itself , can be computed by treating ( [ eqn : dtoptopcondn ] ) and ( [ eqn : dbotbotcondn ] ) as equalities .",

    "then , consider two consecutive locking directions @xmath88 $ ] and @xmath29 $ ] , with the primed direction representing the ` lower ' step in the staircase ( i.e. , @xmath89 ) , as shown in schematic [ fig : transitionschematic ] .",
    "if the periodicities do not _ simultaneously _ satisfy the inequalities ( [ eqn : dtoptopcondn ] ) and ( [ eqn : dbotbotcondn ] ) , then there is no overlap between the two steps as shown in figure [ fig : transitionschematic](a )",

    "but since there is no overlap between the steps , this has to be the angle at the beginning of the @xmath29$]-step , given by @xmath91 ( ` o ' point in the figure ) .",
    "therefore , this is the case when both critical angles are equal ( @xmath92 ) , and either equality corresponding to ( [ eqn : dtoptopcondn ] ) or ( [ eqn : dbotbotcondn ] ) gives the same result .",

    "the separation resolution @xmath140 is always @xmath153 in this case , since one species is always locked in @xmath100$]-periodicity , while the other is locked in @xmath101$]-periodicity for a forcing angle between @xmath104 and @xmath152 .    in the case of a mixture of a species exhibiting a 1-step staircase ( say , for particles of radius @xmath136 ) and another species exhibiting a 2-step staircase ( say , for particles of radius @xmath2 ) , then ( [ eqn : onesteptheta ] ) and ( [ eqn : twosteptheta ] ) permit only one possible scenario depicted in ( figure [ fig : separationoptimization](a ) ) . after appropriate algebra corresponding to this case ,",
    "we get , @xmath154 similarly , for a mixture of particles exhibiting a 2-step staircase , ( [ eqn : firsttranangle ] ) , ( [ eqn : lasttranangle ] ) and ( [ eqn : twosteptheta ] ) permit only two cases depicted in figures [ fig : separationoptimization](b ) and [ fig : separationoptimization](c ) , which correspond to the two cases @xmath155 or @xmath156 , respectively . again , applying these constraints we get , @xmath157 or @xmath158    in terms of separation , it is evident from the figure that separation between primed and non - primed species is possible only if the forcing angle satisfies    * @xmath159\\cup[\\theta_f^\\prime,\\theta_l]$ ] corresponding to figure [ fig : separationoptimization](a ) , * @xmath160\\cup[\\theta_l,\\theta_l^\\prime]$ ] for figure [ fig : separationoptimization](b ) , and * @xmath161\\cup[\\theta_l^\\prime,\\theta_l]$ ] in the case of figure [ fig : separationoptimization](c ) .",
    "further , the figure also indicates that @xmath162 and @xmath163 are the only two separation resolutions @xmath164 corresponding to these cases .",
    "thus , the maximum separation resolution between species corresponding to the three cases shown in figure [ fig : separationoptimization ] is @xmath165 since it is greater in magnitude than @xmath166 $ ] , and it occurs if @xmath159 $ ] for figure [ fig : separationoptimization](a ) , @xmath160 $ ] for figure [ fig : separationoptimization](b ) and @xmath159 $ ] for figure [ fig : separationoptimization](c ) . as highlighted in the context of ( [ eqn : approxdeviationfromforcing ] ) ,",
    "this conclusion is consistent with our experimental observation , that the forcing angle between the first transition angles of the species to be separated , achieves the best resolution @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have presented a theoretical analysis of the directional locking phenomenon exhibited by particles navigating through a square array of obstacles , in the limit of negligible particle and fluid inertia . in the dilute limit for the array ( i.e. , a sparse array )",
    ", interactions between a single obstacle and a particle are sufficient for trajectory analysis . coupled with the dilute assumption ,",
    "we have used a critical parameter ( incorporating both hydrodynamic as well as short - range repulsive non - hydrodynamic particle - obstacle interactions ) to replace the physical particle - obstacle system with its kinematically equivalent abstraction . within the abstract model ,",
    "the particle is replaced by a point - particle , while the obstacle radius is scaled to be equal to the critical parameter . due to the model",
    ", a simple geometric analysis suffices to derive the periodicity condition , both necessary and sufficient for the particle trajectory .",
    "the periodicity condition directly leads to the devils - staircase - like behavior of the migration direction as a function of the forcing direction .",
