    "let @xmath231 be such that @xmath232 . if @xmath233 , then @xmath234 hence @xmath235 is true in @xmath31 by the definition of the @xmath207 s .",
    "since @xmath229 is true in @xmath31 , we have that @xmath236 is true in @xmath31 .",
    "thus @xmath237 since @xmath238 is a member of @xmath184 , we have that @xmath239_{\\tau},[f_{r_2}]_{\\tau},\\ldots,[f_{r_m}]_{\\tau})$ ] is true in @xmath196 .",
    "suppose that @xmath224 is false in @xmath125 .",

    "if we want to show that @xmath195 is universal , we need to elementarily embed every ( definable or non - definable ) hyperreal field @xmath125 into the definable hyperreal field @xmath195 .",
    "notice that there are models of _ nbg _ with non - definable classes .",
    "the proof of theorem [ maximal ] may not work when @xmath125 is a non - definable class because the bijection @xmath203 may not be definable and @xmath207 may not be definable .",
    "if @xmath207 is not definable , @xmath243_{\\tau}$ ] may not be an element in @xmath195 .",
    "the idea of making every hyperreal field embeddable into @xmath195 is that we can make @xmath195 _ on_-saturated by selecting a definable ultrafilter @xmath184 more carefully .",
    "notice that _ nbg _ implies that every proper class has the same size _",
    "on_. hence @xmath125 can be expressed as the union of _ on_-many sets .",
    "if we can make sure that @xmath195 is _ on_-saturated , i.e. , @xmath49-saturated for any set cardinality @xmath49 , then @xmath125 can be elementarily embedded into  @xmath195 although such an embedding may be non - definable .",
    "the ultrafilter @xmath184 used in the construction of @xmath195 in the proof of theorem [ maximal ] is a definable version of a _ regular _ ultrafilter . in order to make sure that @xmath195 is _ on_-saturated , we need to require that @xmath184 be a special kind of definable regular ultrafilter called a definable _ good _ ultrafilter .",
    "the definition of a ( set ) good ultrafilter can be found in @xcite .",
    "the construction of an @xmath244-good ultrafilter can be found in either ( * ? ? ?",

    "we can follow the steps in @xcite or @xcite to construct a definable class good ultrafilter @xmath184 on _ on_. now the ultrapower @xmath195 of @xmath31 modulo the definable class good ultrafilter @xmath184 is _ on_-saturated .",
    "the proof of this fact is similar to that in @xcite .",
    "however , since the definition of a definable class good ultrafilter and the proof of the saturation property of the ultrapower modulo a definable class good ultrafilter are long and technical , and the ideas are similar to what we have already presented above , we will not include them in this paper .",
    "another way of constructing a definable _ on_-saturated hyperreal field @xmath195 is by taking the union of an _",
    "on_-long definable elementary chain of set hyperreal fields @xmath245 with the property that @xmath246 is @xmath247-saturated .",
    "however , this construction can not be easily translated into a ",
    "one - step \" construction .",
    "moreover , if we allow higher - order classes , we can express @xmath195 as a one - step limit ultrapower following the same idea as in the proof of ( * ? ? ? * theorem 6.4.10 ) .",
    "however , this is not possible in _ nbg _ since all classes allowed in a model of _ nbg _ are subclasses of @xmath170 . on the other hand ,",
