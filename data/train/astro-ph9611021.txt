    "the first soft gamma - ray repeater ( sgr ) to be discovered , sgr 0525 - 66 @xcite , was shown soon after its discovery to be positionally coincident with the n49 supernova remnant in the large magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "more recently , the other two sgrs ( sgr 1806 - 20 and sgr 1900 + 14 ) have also been associated with supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "these associations have led to a consensus that sgrs originate from young neutron stars .",
    "the peak luminosities inferred for bursts from sgrs are typically @xmath2erg s@xmath3 for @xmath4 seconds ( excepting the unusual march 5 , 1979 event from sgr 052566 , which had an inferred peak luminosity of @xmath5erg s@xmath3 ) .",
    "these luminosities are @xmath6 times the eddington luminosity @xmath7erg s@xmath3 at which the radial radiation force from thomson scattering exactly balances the gravitational force on a fully ionised hydrogen plasma . nonetheless , the spectrum from sgr 1806 - 20 , which has burst more than 110 times and is thus the best - studied of the sgrs , appears not to undergo the reddening one would expect if the burst created an expanding optically thick fireball @xcite . thus , despite the highly super - eddington luminosities , the plasma is probably confined near the surface of the neutron star .",
    "magnetic fields could confine the plasma , and perhaps suppress plasma instabilities , with pulsar - like field strengths of @xmath8 g ( lamb 1982 ; katz 1982 , 1993 , 1994 ) .",
    "there are lines of argument suggesting much greater field strengths , on the order of @xmath9 g .",
    "as suggested in thompson and duncan ( 1995 ) , a @xmath10 g field could , within the @xmath11 year lifetime of the n49 supernova remnant , spin a neutron star down to the 8 s period seen in the march  5 event . moreover , a superstrong magnetic field may be able to account for the energetics and time scales of sgrs ( see thompson & duncan 1995 for one model ) .",
    "these models are extremely complicated , and there are many aspects of microscopic physics that are important only in very strong magnetic fields . here",
    "we concentrate on the effects of vacuum polarisation and , in particular , on the spectral effects of the second vacuum frequency .    in strong magnetic fields @xmath12 , where @xmath13 g is the magnetic field at which the electron cyclotron energy equals the electron rest mass energy , vacuum polarisation from virtual @xmath14 pairs can become significant ( see , _ e.g. _ , mszros 1992 for a discussion ) .",
    "in fact , for strong enough fields the vacuum contribution to the dielectric tensor can exceed the plasma contribution @xcite .",
    "this has effects on the normal modes and cross sections for photons .",
    "well below the electron cyclotron frequency @xmath15 , the polarisation normal modes for photons in a very strong magnetic field are close to linear over most photon frequencies and incident angles .    at most photon frequencies @xmath16 ,",
    "the scattering cross section depends strongly on the polarisation of the photon .",
    "if the electric field vector of the photon is in the plane formed by the magnetic field and the photon propagation direction @xmath17 , the photon is in the parallel mode and the scattering cross section is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the thomson cross section .",
    "if the electric field vector of the photon is perpendicular to the @xmath20 plane , the photon is in the perpendicular mode and @xmath21 ; this reduction in cross section is understandable , because in a strong magnetic field it is easier to oscillate an electron along the field than to oscillate it across the field .",
    "there is , however , a small range of photon frequencies in which the vacuum and plasma contributions to the dielectric tensor are comparable to each other and the normal modes become strongly nonorthogonal over a broad range of angles .",
    "this frequency , called the second vacuum frequency ( the first vacuum frequency is near the cyclotron frequency ) , depends on the magnetic field @xmath22 and plasma number density @xmath23 : @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "vacuum polarisation does not change the polarisation - averaged cross section , but it does change the normal modes and redistribute the total cross section between them : when @xmath28 , @xmath29 . at any particular density",
    "the cross section is unusually high for a narrow range of frequencies ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "conversely , if we assume that most of the flux is transported in the lower cross section mode , for any photon frequency there is a density at which the cross section is high .",
    "thus , the optical depth seen by a photon is greater than it would be in the absence of the enhanced cross section at @xmath30 .",
    "because the resonance frequency varies with density , in an atmosphere of varying density the vacuum resonance has an effect on the spectrum in a wide range of photon energies .",
    "here we expand on results first presented in miller & bulik ( 1996 ) . in ",
    "2 we give the normal modes and cross sections for photons in a strongly magnetised plasma , including the effects of a significant electron - positron pair density and of magnetic fields @xmath31 . in ",
    "3 we give a qualitative derivation of the upper and lower bounds to the vacuum resonance feature as a function of magnetic field , scale height , and the fraction of positrons . in   4 we describe our numerical method for following photons as they scatter through the atmosphere .",
    "we also give the results of these simulations , and show that an absorption - like feature is present at reasonable optical depths for any magnetic field @xmath12 .",
    "we neglect the effects of photon splitting ; at the energies @xmath32 50 kev of interest here the probability of photon splitting within @xmath33 cm is small ( see adler 1971 ) .",
    "we likewise ignore proton cyclotron scattering , because we focus on scale heights @xmath34 1000 cm at a constant magnetic latitude , implying that proton cyclotron scattering will yield extremely narrow features , @xmath35 , which would be unresolvable by current detectors . finally , in   5",
    "we discuss how our results , combined with observations , can constrain physical parameters in sgrs .",

    "it should be noted that in general @xmath67 is complex .      in the presence of a strong magnetic field the vacuum acquires a non - zero polarisability tensor due to the existence of virtual electron positron pairs , so that the permittivity tensor @xmath68 and the magnetic permeability tensor @xmath69 of the vacuum become different from unity .",

    "such a behaviour could also be found by considering the symmetry of the problem .",

    "the probability of switching from the low cross section mode to the high cross section mode is @xmath171    in contrast , when @xmath172 , which holds for most of the propagation angles in the resonance ( @xmath136 ) , the modes are circular , and @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath176 .",
    "the components of the two modes are then @xmath177 and @xmath178 the total scattering cross section in the limit @xmath179 for any initial or final polarisation state is then , in the limit @xmath180 @xmath181 the mode switching probabilities are @xmath182    we calculate the polarisation of the normal modes using the cold plasma approximation , since the thermal effects are not important in the range of energies far from the cyclotron resonance .",
    "we then use equation  ( [ cross - scat ] ) and the scattering amplitudes  ( [ amplitudes ] ) to find the cross section as a function of the final angle .",
    "we present the scattering cross section as a function of photon energy in the left panel of figure  1 . in the right panel of figure  1",
    "we show the mode switching probabilities for the two modes .",
    "the insets show details in the vicinity of the vacuum resonance .",
    "note that the low to high cross section mode switching probability is enhanced around the vacuum resonance and reaches nearly unity .",
    "because of this , scattering in the low mode can be dominated by mode switching , as it is in many of the results we describe in   4 .",
    "absorption can also contribute significantly to the opacity over the frequencies and densities of interest , depending on the composition of the surface layers and magnetosphere .",
    "if the primary atom has a high atomic number , e.g. , silicon or iron , then even when @xmath183 kev the atoms will not be completely ionised ( atomic binding energies are increased greatly by strong magnetic fields ) . if the primary atom is hydrogen or helium , virtually all atoms will be completely ionised and only scattering and free - free absorption contribute to the opacity .",
    "here we assume that only lighter elements are present , so that bound - free and bound - bound absorption may be ignored .",
    "given this assumption , scattering dominates the opacity over most of the photosphere .",
    "free - free absorption can , however , be important for the lower photon energies .",
    "the free - free absorption cross section in the low cross section mode is ( see , e.g. , mszros 1992 ) @xmath184 where @xmath185 k and @xmath18610 kev .",
    "when the photon energy @xmath187 , induced scattering and absorption are important , and we include this by multiplying the total interaction cross section by the factor @xmath188 .",
    "we have shown above that vacuum polarisation affects strongly the scattering cross section for the two modes .",
    "however , vacuum polarisation does not introduce additional absorption . as can be seen from equations  ( [ master - xsect ] ) , and ( [ disp - root ] ) ,",
    "the polarisation averaged cross section depends only on the imaginary part of @xmath189 . from equation  ( [ ni - sys ] ) , the vacuum contribution , represented by the third term in this equation , is real .",
    "moreover , the imaginary part of @xmath189 is proportional to @xmath190 .",
    "therefore , from equation  ( [ master - xsect ] ) , the polarisation averaged cross section depends on neither plasma density nor on vacuum polarisation .",
    "the main effect of vacuum polarisation is redistribution of the cross section between the two modes .",
    "the effects described here will not be seen in calculations that use polarisation averaged cross sections .",
    "for example , the scattering cross section in the o - mode has no resonance at the cyclotron frequency when the vacuum effects are neglected @xcite . since radiative transfer takes place predominantly in the low cross section mode , neglecting vacuum polarisation would inhibit formation of cyclotron lines in the polarisation averaged spectra .",
    "vacuum polarisation alters the mode switching probabilities , which also influences radiative transfer . in the case",
    "considered here , the increase of @xmath191 to almost unity in the wings of the resonance also increases the number of scatterings that a photon undergoes before leaving .",
    "this increases the chances of absorption , and enhances the effects of comptonisation .",
    "from   2 it is clear that the scattering cross section depends strongly on the parameter @xmath192\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    when @xmath193 the cross section is @xmath194 in either polarisation mode , whereas when @xmath195 one mode has @xmath196 . because @xmath197 , as radiation propagates from regions of high density to regions of low density the resonance frequency changes . in effect , the resonance acts as a sliding window of high opacity .",
    "qualitatively , we expect that the resonance will have an impact on the flux at a given frequency if a ) the optical depth through the resonance is greater than unity , and b ) the optical depth to the surface without the resonance is less than unity .",
    "these requirements give us , respectively , the minimum and maximum photon energies at which the vacuum resonance changes the spectrum .    we can estimate the fractional width @xmath36 of the resonance by arbitrarily setting the bound between @xmath193 and @xmath195 at @xmath198 and demanding that at @xmath199 , @xmath198 .",

    "=    =    =    =",
    "following the procedure outlined in   2.3 to generate cross sections and adding the corrections mentioned there for free - free absorption and induced compton scattering , we use an adaptive mesh to produce a table of physical depth as a function of optical depth for various values of the magnetic field and scale height .",
    "the physical depth depends on both the frequency and the direction of the photon , and in particular for angles nearly perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field the vacuum resonance feature is very sharp , and thus must be integrated carefully .",
    "we achieve sufficient accuracy with 130 logarithmically spaced zones in photon frequency from @xmath220 to @xmath221 , 50 linearly spaced zones in angle , and optical depths from @xmath222 to @xmath223 , logarithmically spaced .",
    "to produce a spectrum , we use a monte carlo code to pass 100,000 photons through the atmosphere , starting each photon at a single layer deep in the atmosphere . for each scattering",
    "we generate an optical depth traveled , which combined with the direction and with the table of physical depth versus optical depth gives the new physical depth of the photon .",
    "if the photon escapes from the atmosphere we store its energy and propagation direction . otherwise , we use the differential cross section to select its new energy and angle and determine if the photon switches polarisation modes , and repeat the process .",
    "it is essential to include the effects of comptonisation and mode switching in these simulations . at temperatures of @xmath110",
    "kev the energy change of a photon in a single scattering is much greater than the width of the vacuum resonance .",
    "thus , in the @xmath22450% of scatterings in the resonance when the photon switches modes , the photon will be comptonised out of the resonance and may require several thousand scatterings to return to the low cross section mode , during which its fractional energy change can be of order unity and in the course of which the photon is likely to be absorbed .",
    "we account for the effects of mode switching by checking at each scatter if the photon switches modes and , if it does , simulating an absorption by drawing the new energy of the photon from a thermal distribution . we do not change the physical depth of the photon in this case , because the mean free path in the parallel mode is small enough that the net distance traveled in the parallel mode is negligible . to speed up the program we also limit the total number of scatterings per photon to 1000 ; in the results reported here , between 97% and 100% of the photons escape in fewer than 1000 scatterings .",

    "the radiation is strongly peaked towards the normal ; part of this comes from geometric effects ( see , e.g. , chandrasekhar 1960 , ",
    "25 ) , and part comes from the angular dependences of scattering in a strong magnetic field . for a magnetic field in the surface , the emission also depends on azimuthal angle , but qualitatively the angle - dependent scattering and geometric effects partially cancel and the emergent radiation is closer to isotropic than if only geometric effects operated .",
    "we also note that , regardless of the orientation of the magnetic field , the photon energy spectrum is essentially independent of viewing angle .",
    "many of the spectra in the preceding section show prominent absorption - like features due to the vacuum resonance .",

    "_ 1996 radiative transfer approach ) the vacuum resonance will be smeared out by density gradients , whereas in our spectra the breadth and visibility of the absorption - like feature are partially _ because _ of the density gradients , as explained in  3 .    in the preceding section we examined the vacuum resonance features produced for magnetic fields , scale heights , and pair fractions like those expected in sgrs .",
    "we now summarise the qualitative effects of each parameter , and compare our theoretical spectra with the spectra seen in sgr 1806 - 20 .",
    "the physical quantity of greatest interest is the magnetic field , because above @xmath229 many exotic processes play an important role .",
    "our results show that if a vacuum resonance feature is seen , the field must be stronger than @xmath229 .",
    "since the location and strength of the feature depend only weakly on @xmath22 , observation of the feature would only place a lower bound on the magnetic field ; this would imply that the field of the sgr was at least as strong as the strongest magnetic field inferred for a pulsar , @xmath230 g.    if the density structure of the atmosphere can be represented as exponential , then the scale height affects the qualitative nature of the observed spectrum . for large scale heights @xmath231 cm ,",
    "the feature is manifested as a dropoff at @xmath232 kev , and the rise at lower frequencies is below 5 kev . if instead @xmath233 cm , both the low and high energy wings around the feature are in principle visible above 5 kev .",
    "these two regimes might be appropriate to a burst ( for large scale heights ) and to afterglow ( for small scale heights ) .",
    "in particular , detailed time - resolved spectra should show this transition as the luminosity drops .",
    "the depth of energy production affects the lower bound to the vacuum resonance feature , and for a shallow enough production depth ( say , nine scale heights when @xmath228 ) the feature is not present .",
    "this implies that we may not expect to see such features in accretion - powered pulsars , even if their fields are very strong ; typical stopping depths are @xmath23450 g @xmath235 ( miller , salpeter , & wasserman 1987 ) , corresponding to less than nine scale heights",
    ".    the pair fraction @xmath217 does not affect the location of the upper bound to the vacuum resonance feature , but does change the location of the lower bound .",
    "if the plasma density is dominated by pairs , the feature is narrowed and detectability requires that the source of photons be deeper than when the electron - baryon contribution dominates . if the magnetic field and scale height are known from other information , the centroid and width of the resonance feature would then tell us the pair density and the depth where photons were generated .",
    "how do the spectra of the bursts from sgr 180620 fit into this picture ?",
    "none of the spectra have obvious spectral features that clearly indicate a vacuum resonance .",
    "there is an indication ( fenimore et al .",
    "1994 ) that there is a low - energy falloff below @xmath236 kev ; this could be explained by a large scale height in our model , but many explanations not involving strong magnetic fields are equally viable",
    ". the x - ray timing explorer , with its large area ( 3000 @xmath237 at 3 kev ) and good spectral resolution ( 18% at 6 kev ) will , if it catches a sgr burst , give us much - needed spectral information in the range where features such as the vacuum resonance are expected to appear ; the high - energy transient experiment may likewise provide useful information , particularly with its wide field x - ray monitor .    in conclusion , in magnetic fields @xmath12 and",
    "plasma densities comparable to those expected in sgrs photon scattering is strongly affected by the vacuum resonance .",
    "since scattering opacity is likely to dominate over absorption opacity , this is an important effect which must be included in calculations of radiative transfer through strongly magnetised atmospheres .",
    "we thank carlo graziani , george pavlov , and victor bezchastnov for valuable discussions .",
