    "many problems in science and engineering can be expressed as a partial differential equation ( pde ) .",
    "finding accurate numerical solutions is often important for these applications , but there are many challenges associated with computing these solutions .",
    "nonlinear pdes can cause numerical methods to destabilize@xcite . finding accurate solutions can require high resolution , large amounts of memory , small time - steps , and a lot of computation time .",
    "numerical methods that compute solutions for pdes must approximate derivatives .",
    "one way to achieve this is with a finite difference ; one of the simplest such methods is the forward difference given by @xmath0 ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) shows that the finite difference approximation will converge to the true value at a rate polynomial in @xmath1 ; that is , as @xmath1 gets smaller , the approximation gets better at a polynomial rate .",
    "getting a very accurate approximation of the derivative may require @xmath1 to be extremely small , which may exhaust memory requirement or take a lot of time , especially in the 3d case .",
    "4 ) goes on to show that spectral methods converge faster than any polynomial , so we can get very accurate approximations with a relatively larger @xmath1 .",
    "this can save a lot of time and memory .",
    "if periodic boundary conditions are used , we use the fourier transform to compute approximate spatial derivatives .",
    "this paper considers the sine - gordon equations in 1 , 2 , and 3 dimensions .",
    "the 1d problems considered here are all suited to being run on one processor .",
    "however , as the dimensionality is increased , several issues make using multiple processors necessary .",
    "computing multi - dimensional fourier transforms amounts to computing multiple one - dimensional fourier transforms .",
    "these one - dimensional transforms are independent and can be computed more quickly in parallel .",
    "memory requirements also increase dramatically as the dimensionality increases .",
    "problem sizes of interest , especially in 3d , may require more memory than one machine can reasonably have , so using multiple computers may be necessary . using multiple computers",
    "also gives more total cache , which generally improves performance .",
    "the sine - gordon equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation given by @xmath2 this equation arises in many different applications , including propagation of magnetic flux on josephson junctions , sound propagation in a crystal lattice , and several others discussed in @xcite .",
    "we consider the 1 , 2 , and 3 dimensional cases given by    @xmath3    the one dimensional sine - gordon equation is exactly integrable .",
    "this means a large class of exact solutions can be found using the inverse scattering transform , including a special class of solutions called solitons@xcite .",
    "solitons are nonlinear effects that lead to travelling waves that are localized and permanent .",
    "solitons are interesting physically and as a way to check numerical codes . for the sine - gordon equation",
    ", some of the explicit exact solutions can not be easily evaluated@xcite . for these solutions",
    ", it may be may be easier to compute the solution numerically and can still give great insight .",
    "the sine - gordon equation is known to have soliton solutions in the 1 and 2 dimensional cases@xcite .",
    "the sine - gordon equation has a hamiltonian @xmath4 given by    @xmath5    we give each component of the hamiltonian a name and interpretation@xcite .",
    "@xmath6 is the kinetic energy , @xmath7 is the strain energy , and @xmath8 is the potential energy .",
    "@xmath4 is the total energy and is constant .",
    "these quantities are useful in evaluating the accuracy of numerical schemes and the nature of a solution .      the discrete fourier transform ( dft )",
    "can be used to approximate derivatives .",
    "the dft and inverse dft are given by @xmath9&=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sum_{k =- n/2 + 1}^{n/2 } \\hat{v}_ke^{ikx_j},\\ ; j=1,\\ldots , n\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    conceptually , we can think of the dft as decomposing @xmath10 $ ] into into a set of orthogonal complex exponentials .",

    "the fourier coefficients converge faster than any polynomial@xcite . using the fast fourier",
    "transform ( fft ) algorithm , the dft can be computed in @xmath12 time@xcite .",

    "we approximate the spatial derivative with a spectral method .",
    "differentiation in real space becomes multiplication by the wave number in fourier space , giving @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the wave numbers for the @xmath24 and @xmath25 dimensions , respectively .",
    "in the 1d ( and 2d ) case , the @xmath23 ( and @xmath26 ) wave numbers are not present .    we note that because the sine function is nonlinear , @xmath27 and we must recompute @xmath28 separately from @xmath29 for every time step .    putting everything together , we have @xmath30    moving terms in around to compute @xmath31 gives    @xmath32    \\end{split}\\ ] ]",
    "the 1d , 2d , and 3d codes are all implemented differently to illustrate many programming techniques .",
    "the 1d code is relatively straight - forward fortran implementation .",
    "the 2d cases of interest are small enough to fit on one gpu , so the 2d code is implemented in c using nvidia s cuda .",
    "the ffts and time - stepping scheme are run entirely on the gpu .",
    "we have found that gpu codes can run approximately 50 times faster for this type of code@xcite .",
    "the 3d problems of interest use grid sizes that are too large to easily run on one computer , so we provide a parallel mpi implementation based on @xcite . the 2decomp library is used to provide an efficient abstraction for performing 3d ffts@xcite .      the 1d and 2d plots were generated using python s matplotlib@xcite .",
    "the 3d plots were generated using visit@xcite .",
    "visit is useful for these because it can run in parallel .",

    "one type of solution for the sine - gordon equation is called a breather .",
    "a breather is a nonlinear mode that is localized in space and oscillates with time . in @xcite",
    ", enz shows that these breathers can be interpreted as de broglie waves ; that is , a particle that is also a wave . in the 1d case , a breather is given by@xcite@xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a parameter that determines the size and frequency of the pulse and @xmath35 is the speed of the pulse .",

    "a 3d pseudo - breather was constructed based on @xcite .",
    "it is called a pseudo - breather because , like a breather , it oscillates in place .",
