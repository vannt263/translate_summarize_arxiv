    "only seven positions remain unique .",
    "the lower atom of the molecule is placed about 2   away from the nearest surface atom .",
    "a conjugate gradient relaxation from each of the lateral starting positions shows that the molecule is either reflected from or adsorbed onto the surface .",
    "the reflections occur for starting positions directly above the atoms and bonds of the top monolayer . from all of the starting positions not directly above a top - layer chain the c@xmath0 molecule is bonded and forms a bridge above the `` trough '' between two adjacent top - layer chains .",
    "the deposition proceeds in two stages , see fig .",
    "[ fig - initial ] .",
    "initially , the c@xmath0 sticks with one end to the nearest surface atom with an inclination of about 45@xmath9 to the surface normal .",
    "there is a very low energy barrier of order 0.1  ev towards the final adsorption stage in which the molecule bonds symmetrically in an orientation corresponding to the diamond - lattice . at this final stage ,",
    "both adsorbate atoms are 1.0   above the top monolayer and are 3-fold coordinated with a bond length of 1.38   between them .",
    "each adsorbate atom forms 2 bonds towards the surface : one bond corresponding to the diamond lattice with a length of 1.49   , the other being a stretched bond of 1.91   towards the adjacent atom in the same surface chain , see fig .",
    "[ fig - overview ] ( a ) .",
    "the result is the formation of two 5-fold rings with a common bond formed by the adsorbed molecule .",
    "there is a slight lateral pinch contraction of the surface monolayer .",
    "all its atoms remain bonded to the subsurface , which is indented below the adsorbate by about 0.05   .",
    "the binding energies of the c@xmath0 molecule to the clean ( 110 ) surface are fairly high , as can be seen in the fifth column of tab .",
    "[ tab - ads ] .",
    "the energy gain is mainly the result of forming four bonds to the surface which yields about 2  ev for each bond , which is plausible by its similarity to the atomic binding energy of 2.3  ev / bond as obtained by the dftb method for bulk diamond . breaking the initial triple bond within the c@xmath0 molecule and the stretch of surface bonds near the adsorbate offsets the result to the adsorption energy of 8.1  ev , listed in the table .      as a next step ,",
    "we have studied the effect of adding another c@xmath0 molecule near an existing c@xmath0 adsorbate . obviously , the deposition onto a site more than one surface lattice spacing away from the initial adsorbate results in two isolated clusters of similar configuration as discussed above , unless a topological mismatch prevents the completion of the ring formation for a near site , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - c2-ngb ] ( a ) . in this case , the strain field introduced by the second adsorbate results in a bond switch for one of the backbonds , with an accordingly high adsorption energy of @xmath16  ev . for the deposition onto a site of the neighboring chain ,",
    "the geometry and energy is essentially the same as for the isolated case , see fig .",
    "[ fig - c2-ngb ] ( b ) .",
    "we note that in this case , the low barriers found in the initial adsorption process are no longer present , likely due to the small local strain field induced .",
    "this effect supports a rapid spread of such c@xmath0 adsorption sites across the surface .",
    "the highest gain in energy for the second c@xmath0 deposition is obtained at a site directly above to the first c@xmath0 molecule ( see figs .",
    "[ fig - overview ] ( b ) and [ fig - c2-top ] ) .",
    "the second molecule bonds at the neighboring diamond - lattice site along the @xmath2 $ ] valley , in a diamond - like configuration next to the first one and forms a 4 atom long zigzag chain which amounts to a seed for the next monolayer . at the ends of the new chain ,",
    "5-fold rings are formed similar to the ones in the c@xmath0 case .",
    "the ridge of the adsorbate is a z - shaped symmetric chain of 3 bonds with lengths of 1.40   at the ends and 1.47   in the center .",
    "the central two atoms are raised 1.3   above the top monolayer , which corresponds to a slightly outward relaxation with respect to the ideal lattice sites .",
    "the end atoms are 0.3   closer to the surface .",
    "the center bond is the common side of two adjacent 6-fold rings connecting the new chain to the surface monolayer .",
    "topologically , the rings supporting the c@xmath10 adsorbate above the surface form a pyracylene structure , which is the basic structural element of a c@xmath3 fullerene .",
    "a local pinch contraction of the surface monolayer occurs similar to the previous case .",
    "however , the outer bonds of the adsorbate are here with 1.6   more closer in length to actual bonds , at the expense of the transition to the uncovered parts of the surface , which are now more stretched to a distance of 1.92.0   .",
    "furthermore , we observe the breaking of backbonds in the middle of the aggregate , resulting in a cluster of _",
    "sp_@xmath17-like coordinated atoms arranged in a dome - like configuration .",
    "the similarity to such a highly stable configuration as in a fullerene explains the fact that this c@xmath10 cluster represents the highest energy gain for an approaching c@xmath0 molecule among the structures considered in tab .",
    "[ tab - ads ] .",
    "the next c@xmath0 adsorption to the c@xmath10 pyracylene - like adsorbate results in a c@xmath18 adsorbate , shown in fig.[fig - overview ] ( c ) , with an adsorption energy of 9.6  ev .",
    "further c@xmath0 adsorption yields an adsorption energy of 8.8  ev and a surface - c@xmath15 cluster , shown in fig.[fig - overview ] ( d ) .",
    "thus , the energy gain is at least 8  ev for the repeated c@xmath0 surface chain addition , as shown up to c@xmath15 on the surface .",
    "we expect the adsorption gain to level off at about 8.5  ev for longer chains .",
    "the c@xmath18 adsorbate has four six - fold rings in the middle and two five - fold rings at both ends .",
    "the c@xmath15 adsorbate is basically identical to it , but has of course two more 6-fold rings along its length . as in the case of the c@xmath10 adsorbate ,",

    "sp_@xmath17-like coordination together with the adsorbed atoms .",
    "the energy barriers for the c@xmath0 adsorption ( tab .",
    "[ tab - ads ] , fourth column ) are either zero or very low .",
    "the highest energy barrier in the case of c@xmath0 addition at the end of c@xmath15 is probably a finite size effect .",
    "the initial c@xmath0 addition at a diamond site in a `` valley '' on the surface makes the bonds shorter in the neighboring `` valley '' .",
    "this makes the adsorption of an additional c@xmath0 easier to the neighboring ` valley ' at a diamond site , as can be seen by comparing the energies in third and fourth rows in tab .",
    "[ tab - ads ] .",
    "there is a meta - stable energy minimum when adsorbing a c@xmath0 molecule on the top of c@xmath19 or c@xmath20 adsorbates ( rows 6 and 8 in tab .",

    "we believe this meta - stable minimum configuration plays a key role in the growth of ( 110 ) diamond .",
    "it enables the diffusion of the c@xmath0 molecule to the end of an existing c@xmath1-complex growing diamond .",
    "if the c@xmath0 molecule is forced deeper onto a c@xmath20 , there is another meta - stable minimum energy structure consisting of one 7-ring , one 6-ring and six 5-rings ( row 9 in tab .",
    "[ tab - ads ] ) .",
    "the energy gain from the gaseous c@xmath0 to this non - diamond - growth favoring configuration is 4.9  ev and the energy barrier towards the final meta - stable minimum is 1.8  ev .",
    "we believe that similar meta - stable defect structures form , when a c@xmath0 adsorbs to c@xmath1 with too high kinetic energy , approximately @xmath21 35  ev , taking into account kinetic contributions to the energy barriers .",
    "when the growth proceeds further , different c@xmath1 clusters along the same ( 110 ) surface trough will eventually meet and coalesce . given that growth proceeds by c@xmath0 addition , the critical stage is reached just before coalescence",
    ", when there will be a gap between two cluster - ends corresponding to either 3 or 2 missing atoms . assuming the clusters are seeded at random sites , both cases have equal probability , but quite different energetics for subsequent c@xmath0 additions .    in either case",
    "we see the approaching c@xmath0 first in a meta - stable bridging configuration from a chain end to a bare surface site , and directly between the two chain ends , for the 3 and 2 site wide gap , respectively , see fig .",

    ", respectively , the adsorbate extends the existing c@xmath1 chain by another atom pair , see fig .",
    "[ fig - vacfill ] ( b ) and ( d ) .    for the original 3-atom gap , a single - atom vacancy remains next to a still just 2-fold coordinated atom .",
    "accordingly , the gain in adsorption energy is with 6.3  ev rather low .",
    "however , the remaining single - atom gap remains reactive , and may be filled at a later stage .",
    "the 2-atom gap yields a much higher adsorption energy of 10.2  ev , comparable to the high gains found in the initial adsorption stages .",
    "the final stable configuration is a contiguous chain with broken backbonds for atoms on either side of the top ridge .",
    "this structure is a bent graphene sheet with a bending radius of about 3   . before discussing its properties in the next chapter , we briefly sketch the other variants for surface vacancy filling .",
    "for the final stage of surface coalescence , we considered a nearly complete surface monolayer , with up to 3 consecutive atoms along the @xmath2 $ ] direction removed .",
    "the filling of these surface vacancies results in energy gains between 6.9 and 10.4  ev , as listed in the last rows of tab .",
    "[ tab - ads ] .",
    "the filling of the last single - atom vacancy can take place either by by a single c atom adsorption to the vacancy , with an energy gain of 10.4  ev without a barrier , or by a c@xmath0 addition process , which has a rather high barrier from a meta - stable minimum at a gain of 6.8  ev to its completion at 8.4  ev .",
    "furthermore , it leaves a singly bonded c atom on otherwise perfect ( 110 ) surface .",
    "the energy required to desorb the extra c atom is of order 8  ev .",
    "as shown in the preceding paragraphs , the growth process by the c@xmath0 chain addition mechanism will eventually lead to coalescing chains , with broken backbonds on either side . in order to investigate the consequences of the broken backbonds for the surface stability during growth we have relaxed a model in which every other trough along @xmath2 $ ] was covered with a contiguous chain , resulting in a c(110):@xmath22 reconstruction , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - rebond ] ( a ) .",
    "the relaxed structure shows multiple bent graphene sheets along @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "the bending orientation is that of a carbon nanotube of the @xmath23 type , known as armchair tube.@xcite    it is known that graphitisation on clean diamond surfaces , namely on ( 111 ) and near ( 111 ) twin boundaries , leads to delamination.@xcite we find for the present configuration that it is stable and does not debond .",
    "furthermore , continued adsorption of c@xmath0 in the valley between two arches is possible without a barrier and more importantly , it causes the _",
    "sp_@xmath17-like atoms near the adsorbate to return to an _",
    "sp_@xmath24 configuration and rebond in the diamond structure , as is illustrated in fig .  [ fig - rebond ] ( b ) .",
    "in order to estimate the influence of surface diffusion of c@xmath0 on the growth mechanism , we investigated some diffusion paths , as summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab - dif ] .",
    "the associated diffusion barriers along the various c@xmath0-related diffusion paths are shown in the second column of this table , and the gain in energy in the last column .",
    "generally , on the clean diamond ( 110 ) surface , the diffusion barriers are rather high , and exceed 3  ev ( tab .",
    "[ tab - dif ] , rows 13 ) .",
    "this is easily understood by the strong covalent bond that is formed between a c@xmath0 ad - species and the surface once the molecule reaches the surface .",
    "the only exception to such high barriers are for sites above existing adsorbates where the binding energy for further ad - species is low to begin with .",
    "c@xmath0 has the lowest diffusion barriers when it starts diffusion on top of an existing c@xmath1 complex . in this case",
    ", the barrier for diffusion along the adsorbate ridge is of the order of 1  ev .",
    "the c@xmath0 remains nearly vertically oriented , with one of its atoms bonded to one or two surface atoms throughout the diffusion path .",
    "the energy barriers are decreasing when the chain end is approached .",
    "the last energy barrier towards completing a chain addition step is only 0.6  ev .",
    "we note that the energy gain attainable for a c@xmath0 molecule by diffusion to the end of an existing c@xmath1 adsorbate is considerable , see tab .",
    "[ tab - dif ] , last column .",
    "these gains , when added to the adsorption energies found for the `` top '' deposition sites , as listed in tab .  [ tab - ads ] , naturally result in the same total adsorption energies as those for the `` end '' sites .",
    "we have thus found two different growth channels , converging to the same growth mechanism .",
    "one is adsorption - dominated growth on nearly clean surfaces with deposition directly into diamond lattice sites , and the other diffusion - driven on surfaces covered densely with adsorption clusters .    in the diffusion studies",
    ", we found that when the c@xmath0 is directed in both major diffusion directions , either along the chain direction of c@xmath1 , or perpendicular to it , it passes metastable minima before reaching the lowest energy configurations at the chain ends .",
    "along the parallel diffusion path , the last metastable minimum consists of a c@xmath0 fragment singly bonded to the surface , similar to the configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - c2-top ]  ( b ) . for the perpendicular direction away from the chain axis towards a neighboring surface valley",
    "the meta - stable minimum is such that the c@xmath0 atoms complete a 5-fold ring , with each one being singly bonded to the surface .    while both intermediate and final diffusion barriers are incidentally the same for diffusion parallel and orthogonal to the c@xmath1 chain direction , the ultimate energy _",
    "gain _ is higher by 0.6  ev for the growth - favoring parallel diffusion ; this indicates high adsorption rates in either case , with a preference towards cystalline growth .",
    "however , the introduction of defects is quite easily possible under this regime , which helps to explain the rather small grain size found in the final material .",
    "inspired by the adsorption and diffusion results discussed above we simulated the deposition of c@xmath0 on top of a c@xmath18-complex on the surface using molecular dynamics directly , though within a rather short time span of just 0.10.5  ps . the goal of these runs was to investigate a diamond growth reaction as follows : @xmath25 we chose the initial kinetic energy for the c@xmath0 molecules to lie in the range of 29  ev .    in a first set of experiments , each molecule",
    "is initially aligned orthogonal to the surface and shot along the direction of the @xmath2 $ ] chains at an angle of 80@xmath26 to the surface normal vector .",
    "the motivation of this particular choice was that the molecule may get adsorbed at the lowest energy position at the end of a c@xmath1 cluster , as identified in the diffusion studies .",
    "all the atoms , except the terminating hydrogen atoms on the bottom of the surface - slab were allowed to follow the newtonian equations of motion .",
    "the molecules with up to 7  ev kinetic energy resulted in a c@xmath0 fragment on top of a c@xmath1 cluster , similar to the structure in fig .",
    "[ fig - c2-top ]  ( b ) . at both 7  ev and 9  ev kinetic energy",
    "the molecule was deflected from the c@xmath1 cluster but was subsequently adsorbed as a lone c@xmath0 on a neighboring clean surface site . while the deflection at higher impact energy seems counter - intuitive at first sight , it must be recalled that the incident angle is high , so that the nature of the process is rather one of a steady dissipation of kinetic energy from the approaching c@xmath0 into the substrate until the molecule is slowed down enough to be deposited .    in a second set of runs ,",
    "a c@xmath0 was aligned parallel to the surface with an initial kinetic energy of 0.12  ev and a starting position on top of a c@xmath18 cluster .",
    "this leads again to the c@xmath0 fragment singly bonded to the c@xmath18 surface cluster , a configuration from which diffusion to either end is possible , as established before .",
    "there is a small region above the edge of a c@xmath1 ( n=2,3 ) cluster , from where a c@xmath0 , if given an initial velocity towards to the surface , can bond to the meta - stable minimum which precedes the diamond position , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - c8-meta ]",
    ". however , in the molecular dynamics simulations the barrier towards growth completion is too high in our time - scale , and we obtained solely the meta - stable minimum .",
    "we have simulated diamond growth steps by subsequent deposition of c@xmath0 molecules onto a diamond ( 110 ) surface .",
    "we find that the initial c@xmath0 adsorption onto a clean ( 110 ) diamond surface proceeds with small barriers ( 0.10.2  ev ) into the diamond lattice site .",
    "the growth mechanism and energetics of this insertion are similar to those on hydrogenated surfaces , as suggested previously.@xcite subsequent c@xmath0 additions on and around the initial adsorbate preferably leads to c@xmath1 chains forming along the @xmath2 $ ] direction on the surface .",
    "the adsorption energies , as listed in tab .",
    "[ tab - ads ] are in the range of 710  ev per c@xmath0 molecule at adsorption sites which lead to chain growth , and slightly smaller , 57  ev , for sites leading to defected growth .",
    "some backbonds at the c@xmath1 chains are broken , leading to a graphene - like morphology , if a 50% coverage is reached for the added monolayer .",
    "however , the surface remains stable at this point .",
    "if the c@xmath0 deposition continues , it induces healing of the broken backbonds due to re - formation of _",
    "sp_@xmath24 bonds at the terminus of the graphene sheets .",
    "we also find some meta - stable c@xmath0 defects during the growth , which may be responsible for starting new nucleation sites , a tendency that would explain the rather small grain size in the experimental studies which motivated this work .",
    "low energy growth may be possible , if the approaching molecule has a kinetic energy within a window of 35  ev in order to overcome barriers and avoid defect formation .",
    "the direct adsorption into a diamond lattice position is possible only at the end of a c@xmath1 cluster or onto a clean site of the surface .",
    "upon coalescence of different c@xmath1 chains , the remaining vacancies can be filled by the same growth species , although with slightly higher barriers ( 0.30.6  ev ) than in the initial stages .",
    "we have also carried out surface diffusion studies . because the c@xmath0 adsorptions normally result in tightly bonded adsorbate structures , inter - island diffusion of c@xmath0 molecule is rather unlikely",
    ". however , an intra - island diffusion path exists , where an added c@xmath0 molecule diffuses on top of a c@xmath1 chain until it reaches its end and is incorporated there .",
    "this diffusion behavior supports the c@xmath0 addition model which was evident from the deposition energetics .",
    "an implication of this fact is that an enhancement of surface diffusion rates would result in an increase in growth rate , by virtue of diffusion of migrating c@xmath0 species to and eventual incorporation into growth sites .",

    "<S> we use a density - functional based tight - binding method to study diamond growth steps by depositing dicarbon species onto a hydrogen - free diamond ( 110 ) surface . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent c@xmath0 molecules are deposited on an initially clean surface , in the vicinity of a growing adsorbate cluster , and finally , near vacancies just before completion of a full new monolayer . </S>",
    "<S> the preferred growth stages arise from c@xmath1 clusters in near ideal lattice positions forming zigzag chains running along the @xmath2 $ ] direction parallel to the surface </S>",
    "<S> . the adsorption energies are consistently exothermic by 810  ev per c@xmath0 , depending on the size of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the deposition barriers for these processes are in the range of 0.00.6  ev . for deposition sites above c@xmath1 clusters the adsorption energies are smaller by 3  ev , but diffusion to more stable positions is feasible . </S>",
    "<S> we also perform simulations of the diffusion of c@xmath0 molecules on the surface in the vicinity of existing adsorbate clusters using an augmented lagrangian penalty method . </S>",
    "<S> we find migration barriers in excess of 3  ev on the clean surface , and 0.61.0  ev on top of graphene - like adsorbates . </S>",
    "<S> the barrier heights and pathways indicate that the growth from gaseous dicarbons proceeds either by direct adsorption onto clean sites or after migration on top of the existing c@xmath1 chains . </S>"
