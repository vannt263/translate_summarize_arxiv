    "brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) , form a unique population of objects both in their own right , and for the study of cluster formation and evolution .",
    "they are the most massive galaxies in the universe , with typical masses of @xmath8 , comparable to that of a galaxy group , and luminosities of @xmath9 .",
    "bcgs are usually found close to the peak of cluster x - ray emission ( e.g. jones & forman 1984 ) and at the centre of local density peaks ( beers & geller 1983 ) , suggesting that bcgs are located at the bottom of their host cluster s potential well .",
    "bcg luminosity is also found to correlate with many global cluster properties such as x - ray temperature ( e.g. edge & stewart 1991 ) , and these facts taken together indicate that the origin of the bcg is closely linked to that of the cluster .",
    "the commonly favoured scenario for the formation of bcgs is through mergers of compact galaxy groups early in the history of the universe ( merritt 1985 ) . in this picture ,",
    "bcgs form relatively quickly as the velocity dispersion in small groups is low allowing rapid merging .",
    "the simulations of dubinski ( 1998 ) indicate that if this merging group falls into a collapsing cluster , the growing bcg will continue to be fed by mass flows along filamentary large - scale structure as expected in hierarchical cosmological models . some support for",
    "this idea comes from observations that the major axes of bcgs are well aligned with both the x - ray isophotes of their host clusters and the cluster galaxy population ( bingelli 1982 ; porter , schneider & hoessel 1991 and references therein ) .",
    "zabludoff et al .",
    "( 1993 ) report that many bcgs do not lie at the kinematic centres of their clusters , and conclude that this is due to the bcg remaining at the kinematic centre of the sub - clump that formed it before or during its fall into the cluster .",
    "many bcgs are found to have an extended , diffuse envelope around them : these are classified as cd galaxies .",
    "cds are usually found in the centres of aggregations of galaxies , strongly suggesting that the formation of the envelope is intimately tied to the group or cluster environment .",
    "schombert ( 1988 ) argued that the excess light forms a component distinct from the central galaxy and various authors have argued that it arises from stars liberated by the stripping and/or disruption of cluster galaxies ( miller 1983 ; malamuth & richstone 1984 ) .",
    "linked with the problem of the nature of the cd envelope is that of intracluster light .",
    "this is thought to be due to a population of unbound stars pervading the cluster environment and orbiting in the cluster potential , yet its origin remains unclear .",
    "often , the cd envelope and icl are not even separated in studies and we hope to investigate whether this is a valid approach , or if meaningful distinctions can be made between the two components ( see  5 ) .",
    "although the presence of icl was detected as long ago as 1951 by zwicky , it is only within the past decade or so that precise measurements have been made of its properties ; this is partly due to its extremely low surface brightness , typically 1% of the night sky .",
    "it is observed to be a common component of clusters , contributing between 10% and 50% of the total optical cluster luminosity , and related to the dynamical state of the cluster ( arnabodi 2004 ; willman et al .",
    "2004 ; feldmeier et al . 2004 ; gonzalez et al . 2005 ; zibetti et al . 2005 ) .    as noted by zibetti et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , a large sample that allows generalisation of the properties of icl is still lacking .",
    "their work examines the icl population at @xmath10 , which will be complemented by our lower redshift sample .",
    "the work of gonzalez et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , consisting of a sample of 24 bcgs , has gone a major way to addressing this and feldmeier et al .",
    "( 2004b ) are undertaking a survey of icl in clusters not necessarily containing a cd galaxy .",
    "however , both studies use single pass - bands",
    ". one of the essential properties of icl that needs to be pinned down is its colour , in order to shed more light on its origins .",
    "the simulations of sommer - larsen , romeo & portinari ( 2005 ) predict icl colour to be similar to that of large ellipticals , whereas those of willman et al .",
    "( 2004 ) predict them to be bluer , though redder than dwarf galaxy populations .",
    "the current and forthcoming icl studies of krick , bernstein & pimbblet ( 2006 ) , who have a sample of 10 clusters in @xmath11 and @xmath12 will help to address these issues , and we also hope to make headway in this area with our deep ( @xmath5 mag arcsec@xmath13 ) imaging in the @xmath0 and sloan @xmath1 bands of a sample of 49 bcgs from a well - defined , x - ray selected sample of clusters .",
    "we intend this paper as an announcement of data release , though we are presenting images and radial profiles ( these are available online at http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/astronomy/research/bcg/ bcgdata.html ) of our bcgs , and some basic analysis . in a further series of papers",
    "we will explore the properties of bcgs , cd envelopes , icl and the relationships between these cluster components .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath14 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the main problem that has bedevilled work in the study of bcgs is choosing an appropriate sample . using an optically selected sample ,",
    "aragn - salamanca , baugh & kauffmann ( 1998 ) found a high rate of bcg evolution since @xmath18 , as expected in theoretical models , whereas the x - ray selected sample of collins & mann ( 1998 ) displays far less evolution .",
    "burke , collins & mann ( 2000 ) showed that the two samples are consistent if there is a luminosity dependence on the rate of evolution , with only the bcgs of the lower @xmath19 clusters showing significant mass evolution since @xmath18 .",
    "we have therefore selected our clusters from the well - defined brightest cluster survey ( bcs ) of ebeling et al .",
    "( 1998 , 2000 ) as this will allow us to correct for luminosity - dependent effects .",
    "the bcs is an x - ray selected and x - ray flux limited set of clusters from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey , extending out to a @xmath20 .",
    "our full sample of 60 clusters consists of a volume - limited subsample with @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and a second volume - limited subsample with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the redshift range was specifically chosen to allow us to see the characteristic break in the cd profile where the envelope begins , and still allow us to perform accurate sky subtraction .",
    "this break is defined as the radius at which an excess of light is seen over the @xmath25 profile , and occurs at @xmath26kpc from the bcg centre ( schombert 1988 ) .",
    "the @xmath27 distribution of the bcs , along with our selected clusters ( shown as filled and open circles ) , is shown in figure  [ bcsdist ] .",
    "table 1 gives the x - ray properties of the bcg host clusters .",
    "distribution of the bcs visible during our observing run .",
    "the solid lines show the boundary of the high - luminosity volume - limited sample ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) , and the dashed lines show the boundary of the low - redshift volume - limited sample ( @xmath21 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "large circles show clusters that we observed , with filled circles being those that we are presenting data for and open circles being those for which we could not process the images ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "small points are clusters within our redshift and flux limits that we were not able to observe , and crosses show other clusters in the parent sample.,width=317 ]    x - ray selection guarantees that the clusters we are observing are genuine massive bound systems , and not chance alignments of galaxies .",
    "this would affect examinations of bcg properties with , for example , cluster richness or the distribution of other cluster members .",
    "another reason for using x - ray selected clusters is that data is available to allow us to ensure our bcg candidates are the central cluster galaxies we want to study .",
    "for a few clusters in our sample the bcg is not immediately obvious as the second - ranked cluster member appears to have a similar magnitude ( bautz - morgan type ii clusters ) .",
    "knowledge of the position of the x - ray centroid therefore allows the most central cluster galaxy to be identified in these ambiguous cases .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      band images with the levels scaled logarithmically .",
    "these images represent the extremes of the masking procedure , with z4905 having 13.6% of the profile area removed from the isophote - fitting process and a2256 having 45.9% removed . , width=302 ]      accurate sky subtraction is crucial when attempting to measure surface brightnesses down to the level we require .",
    "we used an iterative procedure to remove the sky , which acted to improve our sky model with each cycle :    1 .   a large region around and including the bcg",
    "was masked out to a radius of 0.5mpc from the bcg centre .",
    "this value was chosen as we did not expect to find any icl beyond this at the depth of our images ( gonzalez et al .",
    "2005 , zibetti et al .",
    "this was combined with the mask produced through the technique described above and used to reject points from a surface - fitting task ( starlink s _ surfit _ ) .",
    "the extent of the background sampled by our images ( @xmath29 ) deems it necessary to allow for large - scale gradients in the sky level and so a planar surface was fit to the background .",
    "the iraf _ ellipse _ task ( busko 1996 , jedrzejweski 1987 ) was used to model and remove any large bright stars and galaxies ( including the bcg ) from the image .",
    "the _ ellipse _",
    "ellipticity parameter is normally required to be between 0.05 and 1 but the parameter set was edited to allow it to be as low as 0.001 ( the ellipse - fitting algorithm diverges at @xmath30 ) and fixed at this value to accurately model the circular stellar isophotes .",
    "the surface previously subtracted was then added back to the source - removed image and a new planar sky was calculated , as a better estimate of the actual background is made possible by the removal of bright sources .",
    "this cycle was run 3 times for each image .",
    "for the first of these cycles , an additional step was included between ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) in which a new mask was produced .",
    "this mask covered the diffraction spikes and saturated regions of the bright stars removed in step ( 2 ) and allowed better stellar models in subsequent cycles .    in order to check our large - scale flat - fielding and sky subtraction errors",
    ", we followed the approach outlined in feldmeier et al .",
    "we binned up our final reduced , sky - subtracted images into @xmath31 pixel sections and calculated the median value of each bin .",
    "each bin had to have at least half its pixels unmasked for its value to be accepted , and histograms of these medians were then created .",
    "two examples are shown in figure  [ ffhistograms ] .",
    "the widths of these histograms around zero are in effect a measure of the above errors , as the dispersion is due to flat - fielding errors and excess contaminating light which we have failed to mask .",
    "the mean sky values for the images shown , which are of the clusters a1672 and a2029 , were 437.2 adu and 1145.5 adu respectively , which we estimate give us uncertainties of 0.16% ( @xmath32 adu ) and 0.09% ( @xmath33 adu ) for residual flat - fielding and sky - subtraction errors .",
    "the uncertainties for the full sample are provided in table 2 .",
    "instead of masking all objects in an image , the usual approach to taking care of contaminating sources in an image is to first subtract off the stars , and then mask out the remaining unwanted features .",
    "we opted for full masking as it was a technically less complex approach and we judged it to be less likely to introduce errors in sky subtraction .",
    "an incorrect psf model will have a detrimental effect on the sky model as stars may be under- or oversubtracted , but this is avoided by simply masking out the stars and rejecting them from the fitting .",
    "the main driving factor , however , was the speed of the masking process compared to one involving star subtraction , which is an important consideration for our project due to both the large size and number of our images .    to ensure that we were not sacrificing accuracy for speed , for a few test images we implemented a star subtraction algorithm .",
    "the basis for this was to produce a good psf model that would account not only for the central regions of stars but also for the extended outer regions , as faint residual light is our main problem . as in feldmeier et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and gonzalez , zabludoff & zaritsky ( 2005 ) , we constructed a large - radius psf using the cores of unsaturated stars and the wings of brighter , saturated stars as these contain high signal - to - noise .",
    "this model was used to create a star - subtracted image which was used as the initial input for the iterative masking process described in  3.3 .",
    "comparisons of the final 1d profiles calculated by _",
    "ellipse _ using the star - subtraction and masking - only methods are shown in figure  [ startest ] , for two of our tests , a2249 and a2029 .",
    "it is clear that the profiles agree extremely well , even down to the lowest surface brightnesses we can reach .",
    "for each of the observed bcgs , figure  [ galpics ] shows a @xmath34 image in @xmath1 .",
    "radial profiles were calculated from the masked image in each pass - band for all target galaxies , using the mask produced from the @xmath1 band image .",
    "we used the masking - only method of removing foreground objects .",
    "as discussed in @xmath35 , this method is as reliable as subtracting stars using a psf fit , and is also faster and more robust .",
    "as mentioned in @xmath36 , we used the iraf _ ellipse _ task to make the measurements .",
    "the radii of the isophotes were chosen to follow a geometric progression and the centroids were kept fixed .",
    "the resulting surface brightness profiles are plotted in figure  [ galpics ] , along with colour , ellipticity , and position angle profiles . to ensure consistency in colour measurements",
    ", colour profiles were calculated using the geometry information for the @xmath1 band isophotes for both the @xmath1 and @xmath0 images .",
    "error limits for the surface brightness and colour profiles come from combining large - scale errors ( @xmath37 ) , an estimate of star / galaxy light missed from the masking procedure ( using the grown and shrunk masks ) , and the scatter of intensities along the isophotes . in virtually all cases ,",
    "the last two sources of uncertainty are negligible , even at the faint ends of the profiles . instead , the uncertainty is dominated by the effects of flat - field inhomogeneities and imperfect sky subtraction",
    ". however , the errors shown in the profiles and table 2 will be an overestimate of the uncertainty as we are considering variations and missed light across the entire image not just the area covered by the host cluster of the bcg .",
    "we have presented basic data in the form of surface - brightess , ellipticity and position angle profiles for a large sample of bcgs . in a further series of papers we intend to perform a variety of analyses on our data set , including an examination of the morphological properties of the bcgs , the investigation of substructure , and surface brightness profile fitting .    for our 49 clusters",
    "we find that in 22 cases the centre of the bcg is less than 100kpc from the centre of the x - ray isophotes taken from the bcs survey ( ebeling et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "cypriano et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found a similar alignment for 17 of the 22 clusters they examined for a weak lensing study .",
    "we note that the cluster x - ray positions obtained from the noras catalogue ( bhringer et al .",
    "2000 ) have an rms scatter of 95kpc compared to the bcs positions , so this scatter is largely related to the difficulty of defining the isophotal centre . in two cases",
    "there is a discrepancy in excess of 0.5mpc between the purported x - ray centre and the location of the bcg .",
    "closer examination of these cases reveals that both these objects have significant levels of substructure with obvious large sub - clumps .",
    "such a close agreement between the centre of the mass distribution and the location of the bcg indicates a cuspy mass profile with a small or negligible core , in agreement with modern simulations of large clusters ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ; moore et al .",
    "1998 ; power et al . 2003 ) which readily produce such profiles .",
    "it also supports the contention of allen ( 1998 ) that the discrepancy between x - ray and gravitational lensing mass estimates for clusters of galaxies was due to an overestimation of the core size in so - called non - cooling flow clusters that was not present in the underlying mass distribution .",
    "such a conclusion had already been reached by smail et al .",
    "( 1995 ) using strong lensing measurements .",
    "it is thought that bcgs form early in the history of their host clusters ( merritt 1985 , tremaine 1990 ) and that in general they will have grown little since then .",
    "work by conselice , bershady and jangren ( 2000 ) suggests that quantification of observed asymmetries coupled with colour information may allow us to determine whether a galaxy is involved in an interaction and therefore allow us to see how often events that contribute to the growth of the bcg actually occur at low redshifts .",
    "substructure within the cd envelope / icl will also enable us to study the history of interactions .",
    "large tidal debris arcs have been found in the coma cluster ( trentham & mobasher 1998 ; gregg & west 1998 ) and the centaurus cluster ( calcneo - roldn et al .",
    "feldmeier et al .",
    "( 2002 ) also report a tidal debris plume in mkw7 and further features in a1914 ( feldmeier et al .",
    "it has been proposed that these features arise from tidal interactions between cluster galaxies and the cluster potential ( moore et al .",
    "1996 ) and such arcs have been seen in simulations following the evolution of intracluster stars ( willman et al . 2004 ) .",
    "it has long been known that bcgs have shallower surface brightness profiles than the de vaucouleurs @xmath25 profile ( de vaucouleurs 1948 ) , and it is this excess light over the @xmath25 profile which is usually termed the cd envelope .",
    "beginning particularly with the work of caon , capaccioli & donofrio ( 1993 ) , many authors ( see graham & driver , 2005 , for an extensive list ) are now favouring the @xmath38 , or srsic ( srsic 1968 ) , profile as the universality of the @xmath25 is questionable .",
    "in addition , the exponent @xmath39 ( often known as the shape parameter ) , rather than being simply an extra parameter with no physical basis , has been found to correlate with various other observable properties in a way that is not explained by parameter coupling , thus offering a much deeper insight into bulge - type systems than the @xmath25 law .",
    "the value of @xmath39 correlates with effective radius @xmath40 and the total luminosity of the system , such that more luminous galaxies have a larger value of @xmath39 ( e.g. caon , capaccioli & donofrio 1993 ) ; graham , trujillo & caon ( 2001 ) show that @xmath41 correlates with the the galaxy s central velocity dispersion ; and @xmath39 , effective radius and central surface brightness are tightly distributed about a plane ( the _ photometric plane _ ) for ellipticals ( khosroshahi et al .",
    "2000 ; graham 2002 ; la barbera et al .",
    "2004 ; la barbera et al .",
    "2005 ; ravikumar et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "however , srsic fitting suffers from the following problem : given the presence of an envelope , the range of radii over which the model should be used to fit the surface brightness profile is difficult to determine .",
    "although this problem also occurs with the @xmath25 law ( schombert 1986 ) , it is made worse in the srsic case because of the extra degree of freedom .",
    "an interesting solution to this that we have found makes use of the petrosian index , @xmath42 ( petrosian 1976 ) .",
    "this is the ratio of the average intensity within some radius @xmath43 to the intensity at that radius :    @xmath44    figure  [ eta ] shows surface brightness profiles of the bcgs in a2124 and a2249 , and their corresponding plots of @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) as a function of radius .",
    "the monotonic decrease in the @xmath45 profile of a2124 implies that there is very little excess light found here , i.e. this galaxy does not appear to have an extended halo , and this can be seen in its surface brightness profile which is well fit at all radii by a srsic law . on the contrary , the other bcg shows an increase in @xmath45 at a radius of @xmath47 .",
    "the point at which @xmath45 increases can be translated as the point where we begin to see an envelope , and where the srsic fit to the surface brightness profile becomes unreliable . note that the innermost dashed lines denote the seeing radii and the outer dashed line in the plot of a2249 is the radius outside which data is excluded from the srsic fit .",
    "however , we note that although we do see a correspondence in these two examples , a rigorous analysis is required to put this method onto a reliable footing , and we intend to carry this out in future work .",
    "35 of the 49 bcgs show a very clear increase in ellipticity with radius , and this may mark the change from the stellar population of the bcg to that of the intracluster medium .",
    "basilakos , plionis & maddox ( 2000 ) found that the distribution of ellipticities of clusters in the apm survey has a peak at @xmath48 .",
    "this agrees well with the values for the outermost isophotes of many of our bcgs , suggesting that perhaps the outer regions are tracing the cluster potential .",
    "as we have already mentioned , one of the major advantages of our data set is that we have imaging in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands , allowing colour gradients to be measured .",
    "schombert ( 1988 ) considered two - component fits in order to derive properties for the cd envelope , and this was taken a step further by gonzalez et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who used full two - dimensional two - component fits",
    ". it will be extremely interesting to combine these approaches with colour analysis to understand the properties of the bcg and its envelope .",

    "<S> we discuss our data reduction techniques in detail , and show that we can reliably measure the surface brightness at the levels of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . for each galaxy we present the @xmath0 and @xmath1 images together with the surface brightness profile , @xmath7 colour , eccentricity and position angle as a function of radius .    </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the distribution of positional offsets between the optical centroid of the bcg and the centre of the x - ray emission , and conclude that the mass profiles are cuspy , and do not have extended cores . </S>",
    "<S> we also introduce a method to objectively identify the transition from bcg to extended envelope of intra - cluster light , using the petrosian index as a function of radius .    </S>",
