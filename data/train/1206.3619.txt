    "physically , the second condition is fulfilled in scattering experiments which can be described in lowest order born - approximation ( also called kinematical approximation ) .",
    "this is typically true for nanostructures illuminated by coherent x - ray beams .",

    "however , outside the domain @xmath4 , @xmath2 is precisely zero for all positions @xmath17 .",

    "however , even if we exclude objects with inversion symmetric shape , it is highly non - trivial to formulate a phase retrieval algorithm that works _ automatically _ without manual supervision and tuning of parameters during the reconstruction .",

    "for this purpose , the concept of overrelaxation was applied to the reciprocal space projection in the hio - algorithm which produced additional degrees of freedom .",
    "randomization of these additional degrees of freedom from iteration to iteration was exploited to prevent stagnation in local minima , especially in traps or tunnels . in particular , this was demonstrated for two pure phase objects with smooth phase variation ( with different behavior with respect to the traditional hio+er - algorithm ) and a purely real object with strong amplitude variations over short length scales .",

    "furthermore , the the good scaling properties in terms of computational time and memory consumption of the hio+er - algorithm are fully maintained in the ( hio+@xmath1)+er - algorithm . in conclusion , a reconstruction based on the ( hio+@xmath1)+er - algorithm exhibits significantly enhanced stability and success probability in comparison with the traditional and commonly used hio+er - algorithm ."
