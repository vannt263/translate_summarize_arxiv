    "according to theoretical suggestions , a regular secular decrease in the pulsar rotation frequency can be described by the relation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the braking index @xcite . for the vacuum dipole model , when the secular spin - down is due to magnetic dipole radiation , @xmath4 .",
    "the direct way of defining the braking index , @xmath5 , is based on a measurement of the second derivative @xmath0 from the pulsar observations .",
    "the early timing observations showed that the rotation rate of many pulsars is subject to irregularities such as glitches ( discrete jumps in the rotation rate ) and timing noise ( variations in the pulse arrival times ) .",
    "these irregularities disturb the steady secular spin down and hinder a measurement of the deterministic values of @xmath0 . for ordinary pulsars ,",
    "the values of @xmath0 due to slowdown are very small in comparison to the measurement uncertainties and a rotation phase should be well described by a simple @xmath1 spin - down model . in actuality , most ordinary pulsars show significant deviations from a simple spin - down model .",
    "an analysis of timing noise for these pulsars has shown that these deviations are due to a random , continuous wandering of the pulse phase that produces long - term cubic polynomial components in the timing residuals .",
    "these components lead to the large observed @xmath0 values and accordingly to anomalously high values of the braking indices @xcite .",
    "the properties of timing noise have been studied by numerous authors over the past 40 yr @xcite .",
    "it has been established that timing noise is widespread in pulsars .",
    "the strength of the timing noise is correlated with the period derivative and is quantified by a parameter based on the non - zero second derivative @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the observed @xmath0 value is the measure of timing noise in pulsars @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed that timing noise can be explained by random fluctuations in the pulsar rotation rate .",
    "a description of timing noise is constructed in the context of physical models that are based on noise - like processes .",
    "important results were recently obtained by @xcite who presented a detailed study of the timing behavior of 366 pulsars observed at the jodrell bank observatory ( jbo ) over a long time span of 36 yr .",
    "it was shown that a variety of different structures visible in the timing residuals can be classified into groups . out of a sample of 366 pulsars ,",
    "approximately 37% pulsars have timing residuals where noise - like variations dominate , about 36% pulsars have residuals where cubic structures with both signs dominate , and the remaining 27% of pulsars show more complex structures .",
    "@xcite pay attention to the necessity of using long data spans to analyze the timing residuals , as otherwise the structure of the residuals will depend on the length of the data span analyzed .",
    "@xcite discussed in detail the problems that are related to timing noise and the large values of the measured second derivatives @xmath0 in pulsars , and paid attention to the important properties of timing noise .",
    "first , there is a large anti - correlation between the amount of timing noise and characteristic age .",
    "pulsars with smaller characteristic ages have more timing noise than older pulsars .",
    "second , there is a relation between the signature of timing residuals and characteristic age : the timing residuals observed for the pulsars with the smaller characteristic ages exhibit mainly cubic signatures , whereas the timing residuals seen for older pulsars have quasi - periodic characteristics .",
    "the main conclusion of this paper is that the timing residuals can not be explained by the models that are based on noise - like processes because such models are not consistent with observations over long time scales .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze a 33.5 yr period of pulsar timing observations made at the pushchino radio astronomy observatory ( prao ) between 1978 and 2012 .",
    "the prao data sets for 10 pulsars that are in common with the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) sample were combined with the archival jpl data spanning the years 19681983 @xcite .",
    "this procedure extends the individual data spans for some pulsars up to 43.5 yr .",
    "the common pulsars are b0329 + 54 , b0823 + 26 , b0919 + 06 , b0950 + 08 , b1133 + 16 , b1642@xmath603 , b1737 + 13 , b1929 + 10 , b2016 + 28 , and b2217 + 47 .",
    "the combined data set for psr b1642@xmath603 includes also the jbo data collected over the interval 19811999 taken from an earlier paper @xcite .",
    "the data set for psr b1822@xmath609 includes the hartebeesthoek radio astronomy observatory data collected over the interval 19851998 taken from a published paper @xcite .    while our sample of 27 pulsars is small",
    ", these objects nevertheless reflect the properties of a large number of pulsars .",
    "figure  [ gist ] shows a histogram of the characteristic ages of known pulsars based on the atnf pulsar catalogue @xcite .",
    "the 27 studied pulsars have ages ranging from @xmath7 to @xmath8 yr ; this interval is marked by the horizontal line .",
    "more than 80% of the global pulsar population has ages within this range .    on the basis of a detailed analysis of the timing residuals of these pulsars , we obtained the following results .",
    "first , we detected a new phenomenon in the timing behavior of two pulsars , b0823 + 26 and b1929 + 10 , that demonstrates a rapid change of pulsar rotation parameters in which the sign of @xmath0 is reversed .",
    "this phenomenon may be interpreted as a modulation process that changes the sign of @xmath0 .",
    "the second result is that we showed that a long - term structure of timing noise is produced by four types of rotational irregularities that have an evolving nature and form three evolutionary stages in pulsar rotation .",
    "according to the evolutionary scenario , certain types of rotational irregularities can only occur at certain stages of pulsar rotation evolution .",
    "pulsar timing observations were carried out at the pushchino observatory from 1978 july to 2012 february with a four - year gap between 1987 and 1990 .",
    "the observations were made with the bsa radiotelescope , which operated at frequencies close to 102.7 mhz until 1998 may and around 111.3 mhz since 1998 november . a 64-channel radiometer with a channel bandwidth of 20 khz",
    "was used for the pulsar observations .",
    "the data were sampled at intervals of 2.56 or 1.28 ms .",
    "the bsa radiotelescope , made up of a linearly polarized transit antenna with a beam size of about ( @xmath9 ) min , provided the duration of the observing session ranging from 3 to 11 minutes at different pulsar declinations @xmath10 . during this time",
    ", individual pulses were summed synchronously with a predicted topocentric pulsar period to form the mean pulse profile in each 20 khz channel .",
    "after dispersion removal , all the channel profiles were summed to produce a mean pulse profile for the given observing session .",
    "the topocentric arrival times of the pulses for each observing session were calculated by cross - correlating the mean pulse profile with a standard low - noise template .",
    "the parameters of the prao timing observations are listed in table  [ inform27 ] . in column order",
    ", the table lists the pulsar s j2000 and b1950 names , the mjd range of the prao observations , the number of pulse time of arrival ( toa ) , the mean measurement error for each observing session , and the dispersion measure ( dm ) parameter .",
    "the references in the last column mark the dm value that provided the best adjustment between the two sets of the timing residuals obtained for each pulsar at the two observing frequencies of 102.7 mhz ( until 1998 may ) and 111.3 mhz ( since 1998 november ) in the prao observations .",
    "timing parameters were determined using the program tempo and the jpl de200 ephemeris .",
    "the topocentric arrival times collected at the prao and the geocentric arrival times obtained from the archival jpl timing data were all corrected to the barycenter of the solar system at infinite frequency .",
    "the position and the proper motion required for this correction were taken from @xcite and were held constant during the fitting procedure .",
    "the positions of most of the pulsars from our sample do not require correction since their residuals ( defined as the observed minus predicted arrival times ) obtained after the fitting procedure did not show a sinusoid with a period of 1 yr within the precision of the measurements .",
    "position corrections were needed for pulsars b1508 + 55 , b2020 + 28 , and b2224 + 65 , which are fast moving pulsars , but a timing solution did not provide improved positions for these pulsars because of the large timing noise . as the timing behavior of these pulsars",
    "was analyzed over a long interval , the presence of a weak annual sine wave at the end of this interval does not affect the large - scale structure of the timing residuals .",
    "the regular change of pulsar s rotation frequency with time is well described by a polynomial including several frequency derivatives @xcite . in accordance with a taylor expansion , the pulse phase @xmath11 at the barycentric arrival time @xmath12",
    "is expressed as : @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the pulse phase , rotation frequency , and the first and second frequency derivative at some reference time @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the timing residuals , obtained as the differences between the observed times and the times predicted by a best - fit model , are used for the analysis of the rotation behavior of the pulsar .    in order to study the time changes in a pulsar s rotation frequency in more detail",
    ", we show the plots of the timing residuals together with the plots of the frequency residuals @xmath19 relative to the different timing models . at first , the timing residuals are calculated relative to a second - order polynomial , including the mean rotation parameters @xmath15 and @xmath20 defined over the whole data span .",
    "the corresponding frequency residuals @xmath19 are obtained as a result of calculating the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath20 from the local fits , performed to the pulse arrival times over intervals from 150 to 300 days .",
    "the @xmath19 residuals are given relative to the mean parameters @xmath15 and @xmath20 and are referenced to the first point of each interval .",
    "next , the timing and frequency residuals are calculated relative to a third - order polynomial for @xmath1 , and @xmath0 using a similar procedure .",
    "the results of the timing analysis for the observed pulsars are given in table  [ param27 ] .",
    "the columns list , respectively , the pulsar s b1950 name , the rotation frequency , @xmath15 , the first frequency derivative , @xmath20 , and the second frequency derivative , @xmath0 . the next four columns give the epoch of the @xmath15 measurement , the mjd range of the observations , the unweighted rms value remaining after a second - order fit @xmath21 , and the unweighted rms value remaining after a third - order fit @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite found that changes in pulse shape parameters are correlated with changes in the spin - down parameters of some pulsars . at the prao ,",
    "the pulsar signals are received with a linearly polarized meridian telescope . for the majority of pulsars from our sample ,",
    "the observed shape of the mean pulse profile varies from day to day because of either the influence of the faraday effect or the lack of a sufficient number of individual pulses for an observing session . under such conditions",
    ", we can not determine our pulse shape changes and repeat a similar analysis of the pulse shape parameters and the spin - down parameters .",
    "therefore , the pulse shape changes are not discussed in the later sections .    the timing behavior of the studied pulsars is shown in figures  [ resid27](a)(h ) .",
    "the residual plots for each pulsar are shown in two panels .",
    "the timing residuals relative to a simple @xmath23 spin - down model are shown in the left - hand panels .",
    "the corresponding frequency residuals @xmath19 are shown in the right - hand panels .",

    "are indicated in each left - hand panel .",
    "the pulsar age in years is indicated on a logarithmic scale in each right - hand panel .",
    "the periods of the studied pulsars are between 0.1 and 3 s.    it is clearly seen in figure  [ resid27 ] that the timing behavior of most pulsars in our sample significantly deviates from a simple @xmath15 , @xmath20 spin - down model",
    ". such deviations , known as timing noise , may be a result of significant irregularities in the rotation rate of the pulsars .",
    "table  [ param27 ] shows that the timing residuals for all the observed pulsars are characterized by significant second derivatives that are too large to be attributed to pulsar spin - down .",
    "these values of @xmath0 testify that all our pulsars have a high level of timing noise .",
    "detailed inspection of the timing residuals plotted in figure  [ resid27 ] shows that there is an appreciable correlation between the amplitude of the residual curve and the characteristic age of the pulsar  the smaller the amplitude of the residual curve , the older the pulsar . as seen in figure  [ resid27](a ) , the timing residuals for younger pulsars have complex structures including cubic polynomial components with large amplitudes . as the age of a pulsar increases ,",
    "we more often observe residuals that exhibit a quasi - periodic structure with smaller amplitudes , as is shown in figure  [ resid27](c ) for psr b1642@xmath603 and b1133 + 16 , for example .",
    "the older pulsars mainly have the structures where noise - like variations dominate , as in figure  [ resid27](g ) , for example , for the pulsars b0320 + 39 and b0809 + 74 .    in order to study the effect of timing noise on the @xmath0 measurements , we analyze the timing residuals together with the frequency residuals and",
    "try to determine the causes of the large values of the measured @xmath0 for each given pulsar .",
    "we distributed all the observed pulsars into four groups according to the signatures of their timing residuals .",
    "the first group includes eight pulsars , in which the timing residuals take the form of a cubic polynomial .",
    "five of these pulsars have experienced glitches in the past according to the literature .",
    "these pulsars have the largest @xmath0 values , as shown in table  [ param27 ] .",
    "the second group includes seven pulsars that show quasi - periodic variations in their timing residuals .",
    "the third group includes 10 pulsars that exhibit timing residuals where noise - like variations dominate .",
    "the fourth and final group is unique .",
    "this group includes two pulsars , b0823 + 26 and b1929 + 10 , whose timing behavior demonstrates a rare phenomenon  a change in the sign of the second derivative @xmath0 .",
    "studying this phenomenon will help us to understand why pulsars with characteristic ages greater than @xmath25 ys have both positive and negative @xmath0 values .",
    "the first group includes eight pulsars that show cubic components in their timing residuals .",
    "the amplitude of the timing residuals for these pulsars varies from one quarter up to more than one pulse period over spans ranging from 19 to 34 yr .",
    "the characteristic ages of these pulsars range from @xmath26 to @xmath27 yr .    * ( 1 ) b1822@xmath609*.    @xcite was the first to detect slow glitches in the rotation frequency of the pulsar b1822@xmath609 .",
    "slow glitches represent a unique glitch phenomenon that results in regular oscillations in the rotation frequency .",
    "a full pattern of the timing and frequency residuals for the pulsar b1822@xmath609 over the 26 yr span between 1985 and 2012 is shown in figures  [ resid27](a ) and  [ resid27](b ) , respectively .",
    "these plots show that the pulsar experienced three discrete glitches ( marked by the three arrows in the left - hand plot ) and suffered a sequence of five slow glitches that occurred over the 19952004 interval .",
    "an oscillatory character of the timing and frequency residuals seen in both the plots over the interval 19952004 is due to the presence of slow glitches .",
    "the signature of the large discrete glitch that occurred in 2007 january @xcite is clearly visible on the right side of the @xmath19 plot .",
    "the difference between the signature of a slow glitch and that of a discrete glitch is clearly seen in figure  [ freqnew1822 ] , where the time behavior of the frequency derivative @xmath20 and the @xmath19 residuals are presented relative to the timing model 19911994 throughout the whole time span from 1985 to 2012 . here",
    ", the epochs of the three discrete glitches of 1994 , 2006 , and 2007 are marked by arrows pointing upward and the epochs at which the slow glitches occurred are marked by arrows pointing downward .",
    "it is seen in figure  [ freqnew1822](b ) that while the discrete glitch of 2007 represents a sudden jump in the @xmath19 residuals , the slow glitches exhibit gradual exponential increases in the rotation frequency with a time scale of 200300 days .",
    "figure  [ freqnew1822](a ) displays the time behavior of @xmath20 , which has some surprising features .",
    "first , a gradual increase in @xmath19 is accompanied by a rapid decrease in the magnitude of @xmath20 by @xmath281%2% of the initial value and a subsequent exponential increase back to its initial value .",
    "second , the peaks of @xmath29 , which characterize the steepness of the front in the residuals @xmath19 , lie on a parabolic curve that is the envelope of these peaks .",
    "the existence of the envelope indicates that all of the slow glitches are components of one process that acted during the 10 yr between 1995 and 2004 .",
    "the glitch history of psr b1822@xmath609 was described in detail in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "the glitch parameters of this pulsar from the prao measurements are given in table  [ glit1822 ] .",
    "the final part of the oscillatory process over the interval 2000",
    "january2003 november in psr b1822@xmath609 was also observed by @xcite .",
    "the authors have independently detected a glitch event with an unusual signature that occurred over this interval and have interpreted this glitch in terms of a slow glitch , as suggested by @xcite . in a sequence of five slow glitches , shown in figure  [ freqnew1822 ] , this glitch is designated as the third one .",
    "the fourth glitch is very small and its signature is not seen .",
    "the glitch events in this pulsar were studied in a number of other papers @xcite .",
    "examining these papers shows that the glitch epochs , indicated in our table  [ glit1822 ] , are generally in reasonable agreement with the measurements of other authors , but the interpretations of the glitch events are different . according to table 1 of @xcite ,",
    "psr b1822@xmath609 has experienced six glitches between mjd 49940 and 54115 and none of these glitches was interpreted as a slow glitch .",
    "we can not compare a full pattern of the prao glitch residuals , presented in figure  [ freqnew1822](b ) , with that of the jbo glitch residuals because figures 6 and 7 of @xcite show separate residual plots for four different glitches .",
    "the idea of slow glitches has recently received support .",
    "@xcite suggested that the slow glitch - like events that result in the quasi - sinusoidal features in the timing residuals should be labelled as slow glitches .",
    "figure  [ postglt1822 ] displays the timing residuals for psr b1822@xmath609 after the glitch of 2007 relative to a simple spin - down model .",
    "the observed cubic term points to a large positive value @xmath30 s@xmath31 that can be explained by the recovery from the discrete glitch .",
    "we conclude that rotational irregularities , such as slow glitches and discrete glitches , are the cause of the deviation of the timing behavior of this pulsar from a simple @xmath1 spin - down model .    *",
    "( 2 ) b0919 + 06*. as reported by @xcite , the slow glitch phenomenon was also detected in the rotation frequency of the pulsar b0919 + 06 .",
    "figure  [ resid27](a ) shows the timing residuals relative to a timing model of @xmath1 , and @xmath0 .",
    "it is seen that the residual curve displays a large quartic term with the amplitude approximately equal to half the pulsar period .",
    "rapid oscillations that are imposed on this curve are interpreted as a sequence of slow glitches .",
    "the arrow in figure  [ resid27](a ) marks the epoch of a large glitch of magnitude @xmath32 that occurred in 2009 november 5 ( mjd 55140 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the cubic component of this complex structure corresponds to a large value @xmath33 s@xmath31 which leads to a large braking index , @xmath34 .",
    "a sawtooth - like character of the frequency residuals @xmath19 , shown in figure  [ resid27](b ) , implies that the rotation frequency of this pulsar underwent rapid oscillations with a time scale of about 600 days during the whole 30 yr period of observations . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "the cause of these oscillations lies in the continuous generation of similar slow glitches .",
    "these glitches are characterized by small absolute amplitudes of @xmath35 hz , long rise times of 200 days , and relaxation time intervals of 400 days .",
    "the sequence of the observed slow glitches is well approximated by a periodic sawtooth - like function with a period of 600 days .",
    "further observations of this pulsar are needed to study the relation between the discrete glitch and a process that continuously generates rapid oscillations identified with slow glitches .",
    "we conclude that rotational irregularities , such as long - term quasi - periodic oscillations and a sequence of slow glitches and a large discrete glitch , are responsible for the large measured @xmath0 values in this pulsar .    * ( 3 ) b0355 + 54*. figure  [ resid27](a ) displays the timing residuals obtained for the pulsar b0355 + 54 at the prao during the two observational intervals 19821986 and 19912012 .",
    "this pulsar underwent two glitches in the 1980s .",
    "as reported by @xcite , the first glitch occurred in 1985 ( mjd 46077 ) and was quite small with @xmath36 .",
    "the second occurred in 1986 ( mjd 46497 ) and was a giant glitch with @xmath37 .",
    "these glitches were also registered in the prao observations @xcite .",
    "the glitch epochs are marked by two arrows in figure  [ resid27](a ) .",
    "figure  [ resid27](a ) shows that the timing residuals for psr b0355 + 54 over the post - glitch interval 19912012 take the form of a cubic polynomial and are characterized by a significant @xmath0 value .",
    "the plotted cubic trend presents the residuals calculated relative to a simple @xmath1 timing model 1991 - 2010 because all of the pulse arrival times gathered over the entire 19912012 interval can not be described by a simple spin - down model within half the pulse period because of the presence of a large @xmath0 .",
    "this plot shows that the amplitude of the cubic structure , equal to @xmath28 125 ms , exceeds half the pulse period .",
    "the observed cubic trend corresponds to a positive value @xmath38 s@xmath31 that gives a braking index of @xmath2833 .",
    "it is evident that the observed cubic structure in the timing residuals is caused by the recovery from the 1986 glitch .",
    "the corresponding frequency residuals presented in figure  [ resid27](b ) also indicate the presence of a large @xmath0 . from this plot",
    ", it is seen that all the @xmath19 points lie on a parabolic curve that is due to the presence of a large @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite studied the timing behavior of this pulsar during @xmath28 6 yr between 1999 and 2005 and found four micro - glitches with sizes of @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the epochs of these events are marked by vertical lines in figure  [ resid27](b ) .",
    "it is seen that these small glitch events are consistent with the level of fluctuations in the @xmath19 curve .",
    "therefore , they do not influence large - scale structure in the frequency residuals and they do not contribute to the measured value of @xmath0 .",
    "we can not compare our results with the jbo measurements because psr b0355 + 54 is not included in the jbo sample @xcite .",
    "the timing and frequency residuals for psr b0355 + 54 after a fit of a third - order polynomial for @xmath1 , and @xmath0 are presented in figure  [ cubic6 ] .",
    "it is seen that the amplitude of the remaining residuals has considerably decreased .",
    "the @xmath19 curve is straightened .",
    "this plot , as well as figure  [ resid27](b ) , shows that four micro - glitches , whose epochs are marked by the vertical lines , are local events and do not influence the measured value of @xmath0 . in figure",
    "[ cubic6 ] , it is evident that the second derivative @xmath0 dominates the timing and frequency residuals over the whole span of observations of this pulsar .",
    "thus , a large cubic trend visible in the timing residuals of psr b0355 + 54 is caused by the recovery from the 1986 glitch .    *",
    "( 4 ) b2224 + 65*. the timing residuals of psr b2224 + 65 over the interval 19822012 are presented in figure  [ resid27](a ) .",
    "this pulsar suffered a large glitch with a magnitude of @xmath41 in 1976 @xcite .",
    "the glitch epoch is marked by an arrow in this plot .",
    "the plot shows that the timing residuals have a complex structure with a large amplitude of about 270 ms .",
    "the cubic component of this structure is characterized by a positive @xmath0 , equal to @xmath42 s@xmath31 , that leads to a braking index of 106 .",
    "the corresponding frequency residuals @xmath19 are presented in figure  [ resid27](b ) .",
    "we pay specific attention to an arc - like extended detail clearly seen in the @xmath19 curve between 1999 and 2007 ( @xmath28 mjd 5120054100 ) .",
    "four vertical lines plotted on the @xmath19 panel mark the epochs of three micro - glitches with magnitudes of @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , respectively , reported by @xcite , and the epoch of a fourth glitch with @xmath45 , reported by @xcite .",
    "the plot shows that all of these lines are in the range of the arc - like extended detail .",
    "most likely , these small glitches are a consequence of a complex structure of the @xmath19 curve .    the pulsar b2224 + 65 is associated with the guitar nebula and is the fastest known pulsar .",
    "it has a large transverse velocity of 8001600 km s@xmath46 for a distance of 12 kpc .",
    "the motion of psr b2224 + 65 through a medium with significant density fluctuations can cause changes in the dm that can be measured in timing observations @xcite .",
    "we suppose that the arc - like extended detail in @xmath19 can be an important indication of the existence of dm variations for the pulsar b2224 + 65 .",
    "there are a number of arguments in favor of the dm variations .",
    "first , there is a discrepancy among the dm values measured by different authors at different epochs .",
    "as follows from table  [ dm ] , the difference among the measured dm values significantly exceeds the estimated measurement uncertainties . at the prao",
    ", the dm value was measured using the phase shift between the two sets of the timing residuals obtained at the two observing frequencies of 102.746 ( until 1998 may ) and 111.646 mhz ( after 1998 november ) .",
    "the timing residuals for psr 2224 + 65 , plotted in figure  [ resid27](a ) , were calculated for the value dm=36.226(5 ) pc cm@xmath31 . secondly , the jbo residuals , plotted in figure 3 of @xcite , show a flatter structure compared with that of the prao residuals , plotted in figure  [ resid27](a ) .",
    "the low - frequency timing measurements are very sensitive to changes in the dm .",
    "for example , a continuous increase in the dm by @xmath48 dm @xmath28 0.2 pc cm@xmath31 during several years of observations will cause delay in the pulse arrival times registered at 112 mhz during this interval , where the delays can be as large as 66 ms .",
    "it accordingly follows that changes of the dm changes with time , if they exist , will more considerably influence the form of the residuals obtained at lower frequencies , for example , 112 mhz .",
    "besides , as is shown in figure  [ cubic6 ] , where the timing and frequency residuals are presented after a fit of a third - order polynomial , a remnant structure of the arc - like extended detail has the same shape , as in figures  [ resid27](a ) and  [ resid27](b ) .",
    "this result means that the @xmath19 variations over the interval 19992007 can not be attributed to the presence of @xmath0 .",
    "reliable information about the dm variations can be obtained from a comparison of the high- and low - frequency timing data collected over the period 19822012 in the quasi - simultaneous observations of this pulsar at different observatories .",

    "the plot suggests that we probably observe a small fragment of some long - term process that can modulate the second derivative @xmath0 in pulsars in such a way that the sign of @xmath0 is reversed .",
    "if such a modulation of @xmath0 is a periodical process , then the time behavior of @xmath0 could be described by the periodic rectangular function over long time scales . in our observations , the phenomenon of a change in the sign of @xmath0 is observed for two pulsars out of the 27 studied .",
    "this result means that the period of possible modulation in @xmath0 insignificantly exceeds the 43 yr time span of our observations by two to four times and probably reaches 100200 yr .",

    "a rapid change in the rotation frequency @xmath15 is accompanied by a distinct jump in @xmath20 and a change in the value and the sign of @xmath0 .",

    "the cubic trend visible in the timing residuals of psr b1929 + 10 , shown in our figure  [ sign1929](a ) over the interval 19992012 , indicates this case .",

    "we see that the plotted points form three sequences according to the signatures of the timing residuals observed in these pulsars , as was discussed above .",
    "a detailed inspection of figure  [ zavis27 ] shows that certain signatures of the timing residuals are correlated with certain values of the second derivatives @xmath0 and certain age ranges .",
    "this correlation implies that pulsar timing irregularities have an evolutionary character .",
    "we suggest that the three plotted sequences , corresponding to different kinds of signatures in the timing residuals , indicate the three evolutionary stages of pulsar rotation . in other words , these sequences show that certain signatures in the timing residuals can occur only at a certain stage of pulsar rotation evolution . from this fact",

    "the extensive jbo timing observations and observations of other researchers have shown that phenomena such as discrete glitches and quasi - periodic processes represent two main types of rotational irregularities in pulsars @xcite .",

    "cubic trends in the timing residuals corresponding to the positive values of @xmath0 arise as a result of relaxation after a discrete glitch @xcite . to date , a total of 422 glitches have been revealed in 138 pulsars @xcite .",

    "this effect is clearly visible in figure  [ cubic6 ] .",
    "the examples of quasi - periodic changes seen in the timing residuals of the pulsars in our sample are shown in figure  [ cyclic7 ] .    *",

    "the term `` slow glitch '' was introduced by @xcite to explain a glitch of an unusual , gradual signature that occurred in psr b1822@xmath609 over the interval 19951997 . according to the literature ,",
    "the second slow glitch in this pulsar was observed by @xcite and the third glitch was independently observed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the oscillatory process in psr b1822@xmath609 was finished in 2004 .",
    "slow glitches were also investigated in detail in the rotation frequency of psr b1642@xmath603 and b0919 + 06 @xcite .",
    "these results showed that slow glitch events occur in series ; they produce regular oscillations in a pulsar s rotation frequency that looks like a continuous sequence of glitch - like events .",
    "these oscillations in the rotation frequency give rise to rapid , regular oscillations in the timing residuals .",
    "as reported by @xcite , slow glitches have yet to be identified for two pulsars , j0631 + 1036 and b1907 + 10 .",
    "an extension of this work would be to study the properties of these events and to find evidence that they are glitch events , rather than timing noise .",
    "according to @xcite , slow glitches are not a unique phenomenon and they can be caused by the same process that causes timing noise in pulsars .",
    "another point of view was suggested by @xcite .",
    "these authors proposed that it is reasonable to label as slow glitches the observed discrete events that result in quasi - sinusoidal features in the timing residuals .",
    "this fact means that the idea of slow glitches has received confirmation from @xcite .",
    "apparently , the phenomenon of slow glitches is not widespread among pulsars .",
    "a sample of 10 pulsars whose timing residuals demonstrate a regular cyclical structure is shown in figure 1 of @xcite . according to a model proposed by these authors ,",
    "these timing data are explained by quasi - periodic switching in the spin - down rate of these pulsars . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "the harmonic structure seen in the timing residuals of these 10 pulsars is consistent with the precession interpretation .",
    "we suppose that most pulsars from this sample are candidates for having slow glitches in their rotation frequencies .    it should be noted that regular oscillations were observed earlier in the rotation rate of the crab pulsar from jbo observations over the interval 19821989 .",
    "the period of a regular component of the timing residuals was estimated to be @xmath28 20 months @xcite or @xmath128 days @xcite .",
    "@xcite claimed that the observed cyclical residuals with this period were consistent with a physically real quasi - periodic process . in our opinion",
    ", the periodic process with the 568 days period observed in the crab pulsar resembles the phenomenon of slow glitches producing a periodic sawtooth - like modulation with a period of 600 days in the timing residuals of the pulsar b0919 + 06 @xcite .",
    "it is quite possible that the phenomenon of slow glitches presents an intermediate position between discrete glitches and quasi - periodic processes . on the one hand ,",
    "slow glitch events show properties that should characterize them as discrete glitch events .",

    "these parameters change in such a way that the sign of @xmath0 is reversed , as is shown in figure  [ modulff ] .",

    "a rough estimate shows that a change of rotation parameters can occur in the rotation rate of some pulsars about once every 100 yr . the sign of @xmath0 will change to the opposite sign with the same interval .",
    "this process can be a candidate to represent the fourth type of rotational irregularities .      in figure  [ zavis27 ]",

    "we conclude that rotational irregularities in the first stage of pulsar rotation evolution are produced by such phenomena as discrete glitches , slow glitches , quasi - periodic processes , and processes of a rapid change of pulsar rotation parameters .",
    "figure  [ zavis27 ] shows that the pulsars that stay in the second stage of pulsar rotation evolution ( marked by star symbols ) show timing residuals that are dominated by quasi - periodic components .",
    "these pulsars are older pulsars , although their age partially overlaps with the ages of the pulsars remaining in the first stage .",

    "besides quasi - periodic processes , small discrete glitches and slow glitches can also occur in the rotation frequency of these pulsars .",
    "for example , the cyclical timing residuals of psr b1642@xmath603 are due to the presence of slow glitches .",
    "as discussed above , the pulsar b2217 + 47 experienced a small discrete glitch of magnitude @xmath62 that occurred in 2011 october .",
    "it is very likely that in the second stage of rotation evolution , events such as large discrete glitches already will not occur .",
    "the process of rapid changes of pulsar rotation parameters also disappears .",
    "we conclude that rotational irregularities in the second stage of pulsar rotation evolution are produced by such phenomena as quasi - periodic processes , small discrete glitches , and slow glitches .",
    "these processes are the cause of measurable values of @xmath0 for these pulsars .",
    "the third group ( marked by triangle symbols ) includes pulsars whose timing residuals exhibit noise - like variations . in figure",
    "[ zavis27 ] , we see that the ages of these pulsars almost completely overlaps with the ages of the pulsars remaining in the second stage .",
    "this result indicates that pulsars of the same age can remain in different stages of rotation evolution .",

    "the periods of these pulsars usually are more than one second .",
    "the timing residuals mainly are due to measurement errors , although some pulsars of this group can show a weak remnant structure , as in the case of psr b1839 + 56 . in figure",
    "[ zavis27 ] , we see that the measured @xmath0 values for these pulsars are on the boundary of the precision of our measurements , which is equal to @xmath129 s@xmath31 . the limited span of timing data does not allow us to measure the deterministic @xmath0 values , which for most pulsars from this group should be less than @xmath130 s@xmath31 .    we conclude that rotational irregularities in the third stage of pulsar rotation evolution should gradually disappear . at this stage in the timing residuals ,",
    "noise - like variations dominate .",
    "it follows that in the future these pulsars will never be observed to glitch .",
    "an analysis of the data , plotted in figure  [ zavis27 ] , shows that the age boundaries between different evolutional stages are indistinct and diffusive .",

    "in contrast to these pulsars , b0834 + 06 stays in the third stage of pulsar rotation evolution .",
    "this example illustrates that pulsars of the same age can have different evolution rotation histories .    from figure  [ zavis27 ]",
    ", we may estimate the age range for each evolutionary stage .",
    "the younger pulsars from our sample with characteristic ages between @xmath131 and @xmath132 yr belong to the first evolutionary stage .",

    "the third evolutionary stage includes both the middle - aged and old pulsars but the middle - aged pulsars in the third stage exhibit much less timing noise than pulsars of the same age in the second evolutionary stage .",
    "the uncertainty of the age boundaries between different evolutionary stages complicates the correlation between the amount of timing noise and pulsar age .",
    "a detailed inspection of figure  [ zavis27 ] shows that rotation rates of pulsars do not always pass through all three evolutionary stages .",
    "some pulsars can stay in the first stage during their whole lives . on the contrary",
    ", some pulsars can escape the first stage of rotation evolution if they never experience large glitches .",
    "pulsars that have stable rotation over their whole lives can at once fall into the third evolutionary stage .",
    "the last feature of rotation evolution implies that , despite the limited accuracy of our measurements , the deterministic values of @xmath0 can be measured for some middle - aged pulsars that stay in the third evolutionary stage . among these pulsars",
    ", there will always be pulsars that did not experience any shocks in their life and consequently have stable rotation and a low level of timing noise .",
    "for example , we examine the pulsar b0834 + 06 .",
    "this middle - aged pulsar has a relatively low level of timing noise , as discussed above ( see figure  [ resid27](c ) ) .",
    "we may suppose that neither discrete glitches nor quasi - periodic oscillations disturbed the rotation of this pulsar during its life .",
    "figure  [ zavis27 ] shows that the measured @xmath0 value for this pulsar falls very close to the sloping line of the deterministic values of @xmath0 , indicating that slowdown of the rotation of this pulsar is closely related to a simple @xmath1 spin - down model .",
    "we conclude that a measurement of the deterministic value of @xmath0 for this pulsar is possible in the near future rather than in hundreds of years as for the other older pulsars .",
    "evolution of the magnetic field of a neutron star was discussed in detail in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "we consider the evolutionary picture of the magnetic field for the middle - aged and old pulsars taking into account the signatures of the timing residuals observed in these pulsars .",
    "figure  [ zavb0](a ) shows the dependence of the surface magnetic field strength @xmath134 on the characteristic age @xmath127 for the 27 studied pulsars .",
    "the parameters @xmath134 and @xmath127 are listed in table  [ deriv27 ] .",
    "the three plotted sequences indicate that the magnetic field values @xmath134 considerably differ for the three groups of pulsars and that these values are furthemore correlated with certain signatures of the timing residuals . here , a sequence of the @xmath134 values for the pulsars with cubic signatures of the timing residuals is marked by solid circles , pulsars with quasi - periodic signatures in their residuals are marked by star symbols , and pulsars with noise - like signatures in their residuals are marked by triangle symbols .",
    "we see two surprising features in the observed correlation picture .",
    "first , the @xmath134 values of the pulsars showing noise - like components in their timing residuals ( the @xmath135 values ) , is are greater than the @xmath134 values of the pulsars of the same age that show timing residuals dominated by cubic components ( the @xmath136 values ) or quasi - periodic components ( the @xmath137 values ) .",
    "this result may mean that magnetic fields are stronger for pulsars whose rotation is more stable .",
    "second , a sequence of @xmath137 values continues well into a sequence of the @xmath136 values .",
    "this result indicates a common evolutionary path for these two groups of pulsars . for analysis ,",
    "these two sequences are combined into one sequence @xmath138 , as is shown in figure  [ zavb0](b ) .",
    "we see that the two straight lines fit to the sequences of @xmath139 points and @xmath138 points have identical slopes . for pulsars of the same age , the @xmath139 values nearly four times greater than the @xmath138 values .",
    "this result suggests that the magnetic fields are approximately four times stronger for the pulsars that have stable rotation .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath134 values on different kinds of signatures of the timing residuals is a good indication of the validity of the supposition that the rotation rates of pulsars pass through different evolutionary stages and that some pulsars can have a special path of evolution that is characterized by a very stable pulsar rotational behavior during the whole pulsar s life .",
    "we conclude that the observed correlation picture of the surface magnetic field strength @xmath134 with certain signatures of the timing residuals , presented in figure  [ zavb0 ] , provides convincing evidence for the existence of the evolutionary scenario of the origin of rotational irregularities .    in order to check the results obtained above for a large number of pulsars",
    ", we analyzed the jbo timing residuals , presented in figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "we tried to classify ordinary pulsars of middle and older age according to the signatures of their timing residuals .",
    "the obtained results are shown in figure  [ zavjbo ] .",
    "figure  [ zavjbo](a ) displays a relation between the measured values of @xmath0 and the characteristic age @xmath127 . here , 73 selected pulsars showing timing residuals dominated by cubic and quasi - periodic components are marked by squares and 64 pulsars showing noise - like components in their timing residuals are marked by open circles .",
    "the plotted three sequences present the prao data , as in figure  [ zavis27 ] .",
    "we see that the distribution of the plotted points does not contradict the supposition about the existence of three stages of pulsar rotation evolution .",
    "figure  [ zavjbo](b ) displays the relation between the surface magnetic field strength @xmath134 and @xmath127 for the selected pulsars from the jbo sample .",
    "the plotted two sequences present the prao data , as in figure  [ zavb0](b ) . in this plot",
    ", the two straight lines fit to two groups of jbo points show that magnetic fields are stronger for pulsars exhibiting noise - like signatures in their timing residuals .",
    "this result confirms that pulsars that stay in the third evolutionary stage have a tendency to show stronger magnetic fields than pulsars in other stages .",
    "we conclude that the evolutionary scenario of the occurrence of rotational irregularities is confirmed by the dependencies that are presented in figure  [ zavjbo ] for a large number of pulsars .",
    "we suppose that the large values of @xmath0 with both signs are the result of the existence of four types of rotational irregularities that have evolutionary characteristics and form three evolutionary stages in pulsar rotation rate .",
    "rotational irregularities alone are responsible for the large values of the measured second derivative @xmath0 and the variable structure of the timing noise over a long time scale .    as discussed above",
    ", rotational irregularities occur in the form of discrete glitches , quasi - periodic oscillatory processes , slow glitches , and processes that change the pulsar rotation parameters @xmath1 , and @xmath0 in such a way that the sign of @xmath0 is reversed .",
    "an analysis of timing noise showed that several types of rotational irregularities can simultaneously occur in the rotation rate of one pulsar .",
    "for example , the rotation frequency of psr b0919 + 06 over the interval 19792009 underwent large changes that were due to three types of rotational irregularities including a series of 19 slow glitches , a long - term quasi - periodic process , and a large discrete glitch @xcite .",
    "we conclude that rotational irregularities are the cause of the deviation of the timing behavior of most pulsars from a simple @xmath1 model .",
    "this conclusion is in accordance with the statement by @xcite that the timing noise can not be explained by models that are based on random walks in the pulse phase , frequency , or spin - down rate .",
    "such models are not consistent with the observations .",
    "it is known that the @xmath0 values for the simple model of magnetic dipole braking should be positive . however ,",
    "timing observations show that pulsars with characteristic ages more than @xmath140 yr have both the positive and negative @xmath0 values .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , approximately 52% of these pulsars have a positive @xmath0 value and 48% have negative @xmath0 .",
    "these authors noted that this situation is not related to glitch recovery nor magnetic dipole radiation , but is a result of some other process .",
    "we propose that we have found a process that can result in a change in the sign of @xmath0 in pulsars .",
    "as was reported in section 3.2 , this process changes the pulsar rotation parameters together with a change in the sign of @xmath0 , as shown in figure  [ modulff ] .",
    "this process was detected in the timing behavior of two pulsars , b0823 + 26 and b1929 + 10 .",
    "it is very likely that a similar rapid change of rotation parameters can occur in many other pulsars .",
    "if so , then this process could explain the problem that approximately equal numbers of pulsars have timing residuals in the form of a cubic polynomial with positive ( 20% ) and negative ( 16% ) signs of @xmath0 @xcite . while glitch recovery produces cubic trends corresponding to the positive values of @xmath0 , this process could cause large values of @xmath0 with both signs .",
    "it should be noted that such a process apparently can operate only in pulsars that stay in the first stage of pulsar rotation evolution . in the final stages of rotation evolution , negative signs of @xmath0",
    "can result from the limited temporal baseline of data of a more long - term oscillatory process .    in the literature ,",
    "there are different interpretations of the origin of large @xmath0 values . in the paper by @xcite",
    ", the large values of @xmath0 with both signs are attributed to small variations in the spin - down torque .",
    "@xcite discussed this problem in the context of the pulsar spin - down model that involves the existence of a long - term cyclical process changing the observed rotation parameters .",
    "this cyclical process is superimposed on the secular spin - down of pulsars and produces cyclical variations in @xmath0 with time scales of a few thousand years .",
    "the second interpretation is in accordance with our experimental result describing the fourth type of rotational irregularities .",
    "this type of irregularity produces a change in the sign of @xmath0 owing to a rapid change of pulsar rotation parameters . however , we explain the origin of the large @xmath0 values and the variable structure of the timing noise by the existence of four types of rotational irregularities that have evolutionary characteristics",
    ".      we propose an evolutionary scenario for the occurrence of rotational irregularities to explain the observed properties of timing noise in pulsars .",
    "timing noise is common among pulsars because rotational irregularities occur in pulsars of all ages , but the strength of timing noise depends on the evolutionary stage of pulsar rotation , as is shown in figure  [ zavis27 ] .",
    "younger pulsars stay in the first evolutionary stage of pulsar rotation where the pulsar rotation frequency is subject to all four types of rotational irregularities  discrete glitches , quasi - periodic oscillations , slow glitches , and processes that change pulsar rotation parameters , and , as a consequence , change the sign of @xmath0 .",
    "these pulsars have the largest @xmath0 values and show strong timing noise . in their timing residuals a large cubic trend dominates that is the result of relaxation after a discrete glitch ( for @xmath118 ) or the result of a process of a change in the sign of @xmath0 ( for @xmath0 with both signs ) .",
    "the middle - aged pulsars stay in the second evolutionary stage of pulsar rotation and their timing activity is related to three types of rotational irregularities  quasi - periodic oscillations , slow glitches , and small discrete glitches .",
    "the timing residuals of such pulsars exhibit mainly a quasi - periodic character .",
    "the strength of the timing noise of old pulsars that stay in the third evolutionary stage weakens because rotational irregularities at this stage gradually disappear .",
    "the timing residuals of old pulsars are mainly dominated by noise - like variations .",
    "this presented evolutionary picture is in accordance with the results of @xcite , who discussed the features of timing residuals depending on the characteristic age of pulsars .",
    "the age boundaries between different evolutionary stages are diffusive .",
    "this feature of pulsar rotation evolution explains why two pulsars with similar rotation parameters exhibit different signatures in their timing residuals .",
    "for example , two pulsars , b0943 + 10 and b1133 + 16 , have almost identical rotation parameters @xmath15 and @xmath20 , as follows from table  [ param27 ] , but exhibit different structures in their timing and frequency residuals , as seen in figures  [ resid27](c ) and  [ resid27](d ) .",
    "this result occurs because these pulsars have different evolutionary histories ; they evolve along different paths and therefore belong to different evolutionary stages of pulsar rotation . in figure  [ zavis27",
    "] , we see that the pulsar b0943 + 10 stays in the first evolutional stage , while the pulsar b1133 + 16 stays in the second stage of pulsar rotation evolution .",
    "it was believed that all pulsars can experience glitches @xcite .",
    "the evolutionary scenario for the origin of pulsar rotational irregularities is inconsistent with this statement .",
    "pulsar glitches are not common phenomena experienced by pulsars of all ages .",
    "figure  [ zavis27 ] shows that pulsar glitches occur more frequently in younger pulsars as these pulsars belong to the first evolutionary stage of pulsar rotation .",
    "pulsar glitches will never occur in old pulsars that belong to the third evolutionary stage of pulsar rotation .",
    "pulsars in the final evolutional stage either already have experienced the stage of glitches in their rotation rate or have never experienced any shocks in their life and so immediately entered the final stage of pulsar rotation evolution .",
    "as a consequence , one pulsar may regularly experience glitch events while another pulsar with similar properties has never been observed to glitch .",
    "on the basis of a detailed analysis of the timing behavior of 27 pulsars over long data baselines spanning up to 43.5 yr , we have revealed the following important features of pulsar rotation .",
    "we detected a new type of rotational irregularity that is the result of a rapid change of pulsar rotation parameters in such a way that the sign of @xmath0 is reversed .",
    "this process was revealed in the timing behavior of two pulsars , b0823 + 26 and b1929 + 10 .",
    "the detected phenomenon of changing the sign of @xmath0 can help to explain the problem why pulsars with characteristic ages older than @xmath140 yr have both positive and negative @xmath0 values .",
    "we showed that a variable structure of timing noise over long time scales is produced by four types of rotational irregularities that occur in the form of discrete glitches , quasi - periodic oscillations , slow glitches , and a process changing pulsar rotation parameters together with a change in the sign of @xmath0 .",
    "we found that all four types of observed rotational irregularities have evolutionary nature and form three evolutionary stages in pulsar rotation rate .",
    "this result means that a certain type of rotational irregularity can occur only at a certain stage of pulsar rotation evolution . in the first stage of rotation evolution , including the younger pulsars with @xmath141 yr",
    ", all four types of rotational irregularities occur  discrete glitches , slow glitches , quasi - periodical oscillations , and a process of changing pulsar rotation parameters and the sign of @xmath0 . in the second stage of rotation evolution , including the middle - aged pulsars with @xmath142 yr , large glitches and the process that changes the sign of @xmath0 disappear .",
    "rotational irregularities include only small discrete glitches , slow glitches , and quasi - periodical oscillations . in the third stage of rotation evolution , including both the middle - aged and old pulsars , rotational irregularities should gradually weaken and disappear entirely . in this stage ,",
    "the timing residuals are mainly dominated by noise - like variations .",
    "the evolutionary nature of rotation irregularities indicates that the deterministic values of @xmath0 and accordingly to the true values of the braking indices @xmath3 can be never measured for ordinary pulsars that stay in the first or second stages of pulsar rotation evolution .",
    "we found that the surface magnetic field strength @xmath134 for pulsars is correlated with certain signatures of the timing residuals , as shown in figure  [ zavb0 ] .",
    "we revealed two surprising features in this correlation picture .",
    "the first feature is that the magnetic fields are stronger for pulsars that show noise - like signatures in their timing residuals , that is , for the pulsars whose rotation has a more stable character .",
    "the second feature is that the magnetic fields for two groups of the pulsars , those exhibiting timing residuals with cubic signatures and those exibiting timing residuals with quasi - periodic signatures , smoothly vary from one group to another .",
    "this result indicates that these two groups of pulsars have a common evolutionary path .",
    "the observed correlation of the magnetic field with certain signatures of the timing residuals confirms the evolutionary nature of rotational irregularities .",
    "we found that the age boundaries between different evolutionary stages are indistinct and diffusive .",
    "this result is because different pulsars with similar properties evolve along different paths and have different evolutionary histories .",
    "the first corollary of this feature is that pulsar glitches are not a common event experienced by pulsars of all ages .",
    "pulsar glitches will never occur in old pulsars that belong to the third evolutionary stage of pulsar rotation .",
    "the second corollary of this feature is that the measurements of the deterministic values of @xmath0 are possible for some middle - aged pulsars that stay in the third evolutionary stage and show stable rotation and a low level of timing noise .",
    "it is very likely that these pulsars did not experience any shocks over their lifetimes .",
    "then , the measurements of the deterministic @xmath0 values for such pulsars will not require very long , in hundreds of years , data baselines .        in summary",
    ", we have studied the properties of the timing behavior of 27 pulsars whose characteristic ages range from @xmath131 to @xmath143 yr .",
    "we propose that the evolutionary scenario of the occurrence of rotational irregularities can be generalized to all ordinary pulsars in the given age range .",
    "very likely , the timing residuals of younger pulsars can also be well explained in the context of the evolutionary scenario of the occurrence of rotational irregularities .",

    "<S> we detected a new phenomenon in the timing behavior of two pulsars , b0823 + 26 and b1929 + 10 , that demonstrates a rapid change of pulsar rotation parameters such that the sign of the second derivative @xmath0 is reversed . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of the @xmath0 changes showed that this process can be considered as a modulation process in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that the process of rapidly changing of pulsar rotation parameters represents a new type of rotational irregularity that , together with three other types of rotational irregularities ( discrete glitches , slow glitches and quasi - periodic oscillations ) , forms a large - scale structure of timing noise . </S>",
    "<S> these effects are all the cause of the deviation of the timing behavior of most ordinary pulsars from a simple @xmath1 spin - down model . </S>",
    "<S> we found that all four types of observed rotational irregularities have evolving nature . </S>",
    "<S> irregularities in pulsar rotation rate pass through three evolutional stages that show that a certain type of rotational irregularity can occur only at a certain stage of pulsar rotation evolution </S>",
    "<S> . the age boundaries between different evolutionary stages are indistinct and diffusive . </S>",
    "<S> this fact is because different pulsars having similar properties evolve along different paths . </S>",
    "<S> the evolutionary scenario of the occurrence of rotational irregularities explains well many of the observed properties of pulsar rotation . </S>"
