    "the stiffness can be derived from the step line tension @xmath1 , the excess free energy per length associated with a step edge of a specified azimuthal orientation @xmath2 . from @xmath3 , the two - dimensional equilibrium crystal shape ( i.e. , the shape of the islands ) is determined .",
    "the goal of this paper is to find low - temperature ( @xmath4 ) formulas for @xmath1 and thence @xmath5 as functions of the azimuthal misorientation @xmath2 , assuming just nearest - neighbor interactions in plane and an underlying \\{111 } surface .",

    ", we see that _ the lattice - gas energy makes no contribution whatsoever to the low - t limit of reduced stiffness _ , as shown explicitly for square lattices long ago.@xcite thus , we retrieve the result that the leading term in a low - temperature expansion of the reduced stiffness @xmath120 depends only on @xmath121 , which is determined solely by geometric ( combinatoric ) properties . of course ,",
    "higher - order terms ( which are crucial near close - packed directions ) do have weightings of the various configurations that depend on boltzmann factors involving the characteristic lattice - gas energies .",

    "( of course , there could be a standard orientation - independent 3-site term in the hamiltonian .",
    "as in the analogous situation for squares , we expect that such a term would simply shift the pair interactions , at least in the sos approximation as discussed in ref .  .",
    ") the contributions from such a symmetry - breaking interaction would cancel in the interior of an island ( in the 2d bulk ) , but would distinguish a and b edges .",
    "specifically , each side of the equilateral triangle is associated with a link , so that 1/3 of its strength can be attributed to each .",
    "each link has a triangle on both sides , one of each orientation .",
    "hence , the difference between the energy per @xmath62 of a and b steps is 1/3 the difference between the trio interactions in the two opposite orientations .",
    "for the ground - state , minimum - number - of - links configurations , such a term will not lift the degeneracy since each configuration has the same 1 ) number of horizontal ( @xmath122 ) links , 2 ) number of right - tilted diagonal links ( @xmath124 ) , and 3 ) _ difference _ between the number of convex and concave  kinks \" ( i.e. , bends ) .",
