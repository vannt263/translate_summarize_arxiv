    "granular flows have been the subject of considerable recent work [ 1 - 5 ] driven by both technological needs @xcite and the recognition that many aspects of the basic physics are poorly understood @xcite .",
    "surface flows of granular materials , that is flows confined to a surface layer on a static granular bed , are important in industrial practice and nature .",
    "industrial examples appear in the transportation , processing and storage of materials in systems such as rotary kilns , tumbling mixers , and feeding and discharge of silos .",
    "examples in nature include the formation of sand dunes , lava flow , avalanches , and transport of sediments in rivers .",
    "although considerable progress has been made , theoretical description of surface flows is incomplete at present .",
    "several approaches , based on different assumptions about the physics of the flows , have been proposed [ 9 - 19 ] .",
    "a few experimental studies are also available [ 9,19 - 33 ] .",
    "most work is focussed on two systems : heap flow and rotating cylinder flow shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] .",
    "an important feature of surface granular flows is the interchange of particles between the flowing layer and the fixed bed . in the case of a rotating cylinder",
    "the interchange rate is determined by kinematics since the velocity of the fixed bed at the bed - layer interface is known .",
    "the situation in the case of heap flow is more complicated .",
    "@xcite proposed a phenomenological model ( bcre model ) in which the interchange rate is determined by the local surface angle .",
    "a variation of this model proposed by boutreux _",
    "et al._@xcite ( brdg model ) has been broadly validated by continuum models @xcite and experiments @xcite , as we show below .",
    "continuum models developed previously , for both heaps and rotating cylinders , are all based on depth - averaged hydrodynamic equations and differ primarily in the constitutive equations used .",
    "all the models contain parameters which must be evaluated from experiments , but in most cases , these parameters have not been determined .    here",
    "we present here a common continuum based framework for the analysis of both heap flow and rotating cylinder flow .",
    "the treatment closely follows that given in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "model predictions are compared to experimental results and to predictions of previous models .",
    "the general continuum model is presented first .",
    "results for the heap formation and rotating cylinder flow are given next followed by conclusions .",
    "consider a flowing layer on the surface of a granular bed assuming the flow is nearly uni - directional in the layer and curvature effects are small .",
    "the depth averaged continuity equation and the @xmath0-momentum balance equation are simplified using the following assumptions .",
    "the bulk density in the layer ( @xmath1 ) is nearly constant ( since the dilation of the flowing particles is not too large in the relatively slow flows being considered ) .",
    "the velocity profile in the layer is linear and of the form [ 31,32 ] @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the depth averaged velocity in the layer and @xmath4 is the layer thickness .",
    "slow plastic deformation [ 33 ] is neglected . the shear stress at the interface is taken to be @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the particle diameter and @xmath7 is the effective coefficient of _ dynamic _ friction , with @xmath8 taken to be the static angle of repose .",
    "the stress is sensitively dependent on the local bulk density and based on recent empirical evidence @xcite we take @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "the governing equations then reduce to @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the flux from the layer into the bed .",

    "thus , the continuum model yields a source term similar to the brdg model ; the scaling of @xmath25 is also similar to the brdg model .",

    "the data indicate that @xmath32 , and thus the coefficient of static friction at the heap - layer interface ( @xmath14 ) , is not a constant but increases with the local flow rate .",

    "there is a good match between the fitted line and the experimental data , which suggests that the shear rate , @xmath45 , is constant .",
    "similar results are obtained for all flow rates studied . using experimental results for the rise velocity ( @xmath12 ) and the interface length ( @xmath39 ) , we obtain @xmath46 s@xmath47 from eq .",

    "( [ gamdot ] ) is @xmath49 s@xmath47 for the range of mass flow rates considered .",
    "thus the shear rates for the open and closed systems are the same within experimental error , and predictions of theory are in reasonable agreement with experimental values .",
    "the simplest case corresponds to rotating cylinder flow for 50% fill fraction .",
    "assuming a nearly flat interface , the source term is given by @xmath50 . substituting into the continuity equation ( eq .  [ contf ] ) and integrating we obtain @xmath51 using eq .",

    "( [ mc3 ] ) , the flux equation ( eq .  [ udelta ] ) gives the layer thickness profile as @xmath53 which is symmetric for all rotational speeds ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "( [ deltamak ] ) corresponds to the model of makse @xcite , in which the shear rate is assumed to be a fitting parameter . in the present case the shear rate",
    "is obtained from eq .",

    "substituting these results in eq .",

    "( [ source2 ] ) with @xmath50 and @xmath56 .",
    "this allows for calculation of the angle ( @xmath43 ) along the interface .",
    "thus the assumption of a constant shear rate is consistent with the model , and gives a complete description of the flow .",
    "however , it is not apparent from the analysis , under what conditions the solution is valid .",
    "consider next the case when the shear rate is not constant along the layer , but when the acceleration ( @xmath57 ) is small .",
    "eliminating @xmath4 using eq .",
    "( [ udelta ] ) , the scaled momentum balance becomes @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 and the dimensionless parameters are the froude number , @xmath61 , and the size ratio , @xmath62 .",

    "( [ momscal ] ) is the net driving force , that is the gravitational force less the frictional resistance to flow , and is independent of the flow velocity ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the second term is the ` viscous ' resistance due to collisional stresses , and the third term arises as a result of in - flow and out - flow of particles from the layer .",

    "the collisional stress term is of the same magnitude as the net driving force term since the flow velocity increases to balance the two .",

    ", we have @xmath78 , thus there is no steady flow possible if the interface angle is less the static angle of repose .",
    "this is consistent with the definition of the static angle of repose .",
    "note that the layer profile is not symmetric about @xmath68 , and for any @xmath79 we have @xmath80 , that is , the upper part of the layer ( @xmath81 ) is thicker than the lower part .",
    "the source of the asymmetry is the in - flow / out - flow term in the momentum balance ( third term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ momscal ] ) . in the upper part of the layer ( @xmath81 ) the flow is retarded by material entering the layer from the bed ( @xmath82 ) and the reverse is true in the lower part of the layer .",
    "thus , the layer is thicker in upper part because of the lower velocity relative to the lower part of the layer ( @xmath79 ) , resulting in a skewed profile .",
    "further , eq .  ( [ deltath ] ) indicates that the profile becomes more skewed with increasing froude number ( @xmath83 ) and decreasing size ratio ( @xmath84 ) . in the limit , @xmath85 , the scaled layer thickness profile becomes @xmath86 , which is identical to the result obtained assuming a constant shear ( eq .  [ deltamak ] ) when eq .",
    "( [ gamdot ] ) is used to calculate the shear rate .",
    "this implies that a profile symmetric about the layer midpoint ( @xmath68 ) is obtained at very low froude numbers and relatively high size ratios , and in this limit the shear rate is nearly constant .    the interface angle profile ( @xmath87 ) is obtained from eq .",

    "( [ betath ] ) indicates that the interface angle decreases monotonically with distance along the interface and at @xmath68 , @xmath90 .",
    "thus in the rotating cylinder flow the maximum angle of repose can be experimentally obtained by measuring the interface angle at the midpoint of the layer . for @xmath91 sufficiently large and @xmath79 , we get @xmath92 , that is , for small size ratios and large froude numbers the layer profile may turn up at the end . conversely , when @xmath93 , eq .",
    "( [ betath ] ) yields @xmath94 , and the interface profile is nearly flat .",
    "neglecting terms @xmath95 , which is consistent with the approximation in the momentum balance equation , we get @xmath96",
    ".    consider next a comparison of the theoretical results to experimental data .",
    "a few key numbers are reported , as they convey a sense of qualitative agreement . however , for full details the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "the model parameters required are @xmath8 , @xmath32 and @xmath97 .",
    "data of orpe and khakhar @xcite for the first two parameters are shown in fig .",
    "[ betamdelta.mdot]a ( open symbols ) for 2 mm steel balls in rotating cylinders of 3 sizes and for different rotational speeds of the cylinders .",
    "the data correlates reasonably well with the mass flow rate at the midpoint of the layer calculated from @xmath98 , where @xmath30 is the cylinder length and the same density as in the heap experiments ( @xmath41 g/@xmath42 ) is used .",
    "data spanning nearly two decades of flow rate fall on a single curve , although with some scatter .",
    "the maximum angle of repose increases with mass flow rate , and the measured values are similar to those from heap experiments which are also shown in the same figure .",
    "the static angle of repose is the angle at @xmath99 .",
    "orpe and khakhar @xcite had obtained @xmath100 by fitting the theory of khakhar _ et al . _",
    "@xcite to experimental layer thickness profiles .",
    "we obtain a new estimate of the parameter based on the layer thickness at the midpoint of the layer ( @xmath68 ) , which , from eq .",

    "the data falls on a straight line for each material ( although with some scatter ) and a least squares fit gives @xmath104 for steel balls , @xmath105 for glass beads and @xmath106 for sand .",
    "since the model is essentially exact at @xmath68 , the good fit implies that the proposed constitutive equation for stress is reasonable , and the shear rate in the layer is well - described by eq .",

    "the profile is nearly symmetric ( steel balls at the lowest @xmath83 ) , and the profiles become more skewed with increasing @xmath83 and decreasing @xmath84 .",
    "the deviation at the high froude numbers and low size ratio are due to neglect of the acceleration term .",
    "similar agreement is obtained for the other cases studied as well .",
    "the predictions of the model of khakhar _",
    "et al._@xcite are shown in the figure as dashed lines .",
    "these nearly coincide with the results from the present model , except for the highest @xmath83 for sand , indicating that the approximations made are reasonable for the parameter values of interest .",
    "it is remarkable that such a simple theory is able to describe the behavior of the system over such a wide range of parameters : materials include steel balls , glass beads and sand ; varying shapes with steel balls being spherical , glass beads , nearly spherical and sand being irregularly shaped ; size ratios in the range @xmath107 and froude numbers in the range @xmath108 .",
    "model predictions of the interface angle profile are in reasonable agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "a theoretical framework serves to unify the behaviour of surface flows for two prototypical systems : heap flow and rotating cylinder flow .",
    "the model is based on a stress constitutive equation and failure criterion which contain three material parameters : @xmath8 , @xmath32 and @xmath97 .",
    "analytical results for both systems give a complete description of the systems in terms of the layer thickness profiles ( @xmath109 ) , average velocity of flow ( @xmath110 ) and the interface angle profile ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "in open heap systems a layer of uniform thickness with a uniform flow velocity is obtained , whereas in the closed heap system @xmath112 .",
    "the interface angle is constant and equal to the maximum angle of repose in the open system , whereas it decreases with distance from the pouring point in the closed system .",
    "results for the rotating cylinder are obtained for the case when the acceleration of particles in the layer is small ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the layer profile is found to be asymmetric about the midpoint of the layer ( @xmath68 ) with the upper part of the layer ( @xmath81 ) being thicker .",
    "the skewness increases with increasing froude numbers and decreasing size ratios .",
    "the scaled shear rate ( @xmath113 ) decreases with increasing froude number and size ratio .",
    "the layer interface angle decreases with distance in the flow direction . for high @xmath114 and @xmath79",
    "the layer turns up , whereas when @xmath114 is small a nearly flat interface is obtained .",
    "quasi-2d experiments carried out for open and closed heaps and rotating cylinders of different sizes , by and large , validate the predictions of the theory .",
    "the three material parameters of the model ( @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath97 ) are all obtained from relatively simple measurements .",
    "the model equation can thus be applied to more complex geometries .",
    "deviations of the model from experimental data appear in the interface angle profile in the rotating cylinder flow .",
    "this is most likely due to end wall effects which are discussed in @xcite .",
