    "synchronization of dynamical processes on networks is presently an active research topic .",
    "it represents a mathematical framework that on the one hand can elucidate  desired or undesired  synchronization phenomena in diverse applications . on the other hand ,",
    "the synchronization paradigm is formulated in such a manner that powerful mathematical techniques from dynamical systems and graph theory can be utilized .",
    "a standard version is @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the discrete time , @xmath4 denotes the state variable of unit ( veretex ) @xmath5 , and for @xmath6 , @xmath7 is a @xmath8 function .",
    "this dynamical systems formulation contains two aspects .",
    "one of them is the reaction dynamics at each node or vertex of the network .",
    "the other one is the coupling structure , that is , whether and how strongly , the dynamics at one node is directly influenced by the states of the other nodes .",
    "equation ( [ simple ] ) clearly is an abstraction and simplification of synchronization problems found in applications . on the basis of understanding the dynamics of ( [ simple ] ) , research",
    "should then move on to more realistic scenarios . therefore , in the present work , we address the question of synchronization when the right hand side of ( [ simple ] ) is allowed to vary in time .",
    "thus , not only the dynamics itself is a temporal process , but also the underlying structure changes in time , albeit in some applications that may occur on a slower time scale .",
    "the essence of the hypotheses on @xmath9 $ ] needed for synchronization results ( to be stated in precise terms shortly ) is that synchronization is possible as an invariant state , that is , when the dynamics starts on the diagonal @xmath10 $ ] , it will stay there , and that this diagonal possesses a stable attracting state .",
    "the question about synchronization then is whether this state is also attracting for dynamical states @xmath11 $ ] outside the diagonal , at least locally , that is when the components @xmath12 are not necessarily equal , but close to each other .",
    "this can be translated into a question about transverse lyapunov exponents , and one typically concludes that the existence of a synchronized attractor in the sense of milnor . in our contribution , we can already strengthen this result by concluding ( under appropriate assumptions ) the existence of a synchronized attractor in the strong sense instead of only in the weaker sense of milnor .",
    "( we shall call this local complete synchronization . )",
    "this comes about because we achieve a reformulation of the synchronization problem in terms of hajnal diameters ( a concept to be explained below ) .",
    "our work , however , goes beyond that .",
    "as already indicated , our main contribution is that we can study the local complete synchronization of general coupled networks with time - varying coupling functions , in which each unit is dynamically evolving according to @xmath13 this formulation , in fact , covers both aspects described above , the reaction dynamics as well as the coupling structure .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper then is to identify general conditions under which we can prove synchronization of the dynamics ( [ general ] ) .",
    "thus , we can handle variations of the reaction dynamics as well as of the underlying network topology",
    ". we shall mention below various applications where this is of interest .    before that , however , we state our technical hypothesis on the right hand side of ( [ general ] ) : for each @xmath14 , @xmath15 is a @xmath8 function with the following hypothesis :    _ @xmath16 . there exists a @xmath8 function @xmath17 such that @xmath18 holds for all @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , for any compact set @xmath21 @xmath22 and the jacobian matrices @xmath23_{i , j=1}^{m}$ ] are all equicontinuous in @xmath24 with respect to @xmath14 and the latter are all nonsingular in @xmath24 .",
    "_    this hypothesis ensures that the diagonal synchronization manifold @xmath25^{\\top}\\in\\mathbb r^{m}:~x^{i}=x^{j},~i , j={1,2,\\cdots , m}\\bigg\\}\\ ] ] is an invariant manifold for the evolution ( [ general ] ) .",
    "if @xmath26 denotes the synchronized state , then @xmath27 for the synchronized state ( [ syn ] ) , we assume the existence of an attractor :    _ @xmath28 .",
    "there exists a compact asymptotically stable attractor @xmath29 for eq .",
    "( [ syn ] ) .",
    "that is , ( i ) @xmath30 is a forward invariant set ; ( ii ) for any neighborhood @xmath31 of @xmath29 there exists a neighborhood @xmath32 of @xmath29 such that @xmath33 for all @xmath34 ; ( iii ) for any sufficiently small neighborhood @xmath31 of @xmath29 , @xmath35 converges to @xmath29 , in the sense that for any neighborhood @xmath32 , there exists @xmath36 such that @xmath37 for @xmath38 ; ( iv ) there exists @xmath39 for which the @xmath40-limit set is @xmath29 .",
    "_    let @xmath41 denote the cartesian product @xmath42 ( @xmath43 times ) .",
    "local complete synchronization ( synchronization for simplicity ) is defined in the sense that the set @xmath44 : x \\in a\\}$ ] is an asymptotically stable attractor in @xmath45 .",
    "that is , for the coupled dynamical system ( [ general ] ) , differences between components converge to zero if the initial states are picked sufficiently near @xmath46 , i.e. , if the components are all close to the attractor @xmath29 and if their differences are sufficiently small . in order to show such a synchronization",
    ", one needs a third hypothesis _",
    "@xmath47 _ that in technical terms is about lyapunov exponents transverse to the diagonal .",
    "that is , while the dynamics on the attractor may well be expanding ( the attractor might be chaotic ) , the transverse directions need to be suitably contracting to ensure synchronization . the corresponding hypothesis _",
    "@xmath47 _ will be stated below ( see ( [ thm1 ] ) ) because it requires the introduction of crucial technical concepts .",
    "it is an important aspect of our work that we shall derive the attractivity here in the classical sense , and not in the sense of milnor , i.e. , not only some set of positive measure , but a full neighborhood is attracted . for details about the difference between milnor attractors and asymptotically stable attractors ; see @xcite . usually , when studying synchronization , one derives only the existence of a milnor attractor ; see @xcite .",
    "the motivation for studying ( [ general ] ) comes from the well - known coupled map lattices ( cml ) @xcite , which can be written as follows : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a differentiable map and @xmath50_{i , j=1}^{m}\\in \\mathbb{r}^{m\\times m}$ ] is the diffusion matrix , which is determined by the topological structure of the network and satisfies @xmath51 for all @xmath52 , and @xmath53 for all @xmath6 . letting @xmath54^{\\top}\\in \\mathbb{r}^{m}$ ] , @xmath55^{\\top}\\in \\mathbb{r}^{m}$ ] , and",
    "@xmath56 , where @xmath57 denotes the identity matrix of dimension @xmath43 , the cml ( [ cml - comp ] ) can be written in the matrix form @xmath58 where @xmath59_{i , j=1}^{m}\\in \\mathbb{r}^{m\\times m}$ ] denotes the coupling and satisfies @xmath60 for @xmath52 and @xmath61 for all @xmath6 .",
    "so , if @xmath62 holds for all @xmath6 , then @xmath63 is a stochastic matrix .",
    "recently , synchronization of cml has attracted increasing attention @xcite .",
    "linear stability analysis of the synchronization manifold was proposed and transverse lyapunov exponents were used to analyze the influence of the topological structure of networks . in @xcite , conditions for generalized transverse stability were presented . if the transverse ( normal ) lyapunov exponents are negative , a chaotic attractor on an invariant submanifold can be asymptotically stable over the manifold . ref .",
    "@xcite have found out that chaos synchronization in a network of nonlinear continuous - time or discrete - time dynamical systems respectively is possible if and only if the corresponding graph has a spanning tree .",
    "however , synchronization analysis has so far been limited to autonomous systems , where the interactions between the vertices ( state components ) are static and do not vary through time .    in the social , natural , and engineering real - world , the topology of the network often varies through time . in communication networks , for example , one must consider dynamical networks of moving agents . since the agents are moving , some of the existing connections can fail simply due to occurrence of an obstacle between agents . also , some new connections may be created when one agent enters the effective region of other agents @xcite . on top of that",
    ", randomness may also occur . in a communication network ,",
    "the information channel of two agents at each time may be random @xcite .",
    "when an error occurs at some time , the connections in the system will vary . in @xcite , synchronization of multi - agent networks was considered where the state of each vertex is adapted according to the states of its connected neighbors with switching connecting topologies .",
    "this multi - agent dynamical network can be written in discrete - time form as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the state variable of vertex @xmath66 and @xmath67_{i , j=1}^{m}$ ] , @xmath14 , are stochastic matrices .",
    "@xcite considered a convexity - conserving coupling function which is equivalent to the linear coupling function in ( [ multi ] ) .",
    "it was found that the connectivity of the switching graphs plays a key role in the synchronization of multi - agent networks with switching topologies . also , in the recent literature @xcite , synchronization of continuous - time dynamical networks with time - varying topologies",
    "was studied .",
    "the time - varying couplings investigated , however , are specific , with either symmetry @xcite , node balance @xcite , or fixed time average @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural to investigate the synchronization of cml with general time - varying connections as : @xmath68 where @xmath69_{i , j=1}^{m}\\in\\mathbb r^{m\\times m}$ ] denotes the coupling matrix at time @xmath70 and @xmath71^{\\top}$ ] is a differentiable function .",
    "we shall address this problem in the context of the general coupled system ( [ general ] ) .",
    "let @xmath72 ~\\text { and } ~f_{t}(x(t))=\\left[\\begin{array}{c } f^{1}_{t}(x^{1}(t),\\cdots , x^{m}(t))\\\\f^{2}_{t}(x^{1}(t),\\cdots , x^{m}(t))\\\\\\vdots \\\\f^{m}_{t}(x^{1}(t),\\cdots , x^{m}(t))\\end{array}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) can be rewritten in a matrix form : @xmath73    the time - varying coupling can have a special form and may be driven by some other dynamical system .",
    "let @xmath74 denote a metric dynamical system ( mds ) , where @xmath75 is the metric state space , @xmath76 is the @xmath77-algebra , @xmath78 is the probability measure , and @xmath79 is a semiflow satisfying @xmath80 and @xmath81 , where @xmath82 denotes the identity map .",
    "then , the coupled system can be regarded as a random dynamical system ( rds ) driven by @xmath83 : @xmath84 in fact , one can regard the dynamical system ( [ rds ] ) as a skew product semiflow , @xmath85 furthermore , the coupled system can have the form @xmath86 where @xmath87 belongs to some function class @xmath88 and may be interpreted as an external input or force . then , defining @xmath89(\\tau)=u(t+\\tau)$ ] as a shift map , the system ( [ ex ] ) has the form of ( [ rds ] ) . in this paper",
    ", we first investigate the general time - varying case of the system ( [ matrix ] ) and also apply our results to systems of the form ( [ rds ] ) .    to study synchronization of the system ( [ matrix ] ) , we use its variational equation by linearizing it . consider the difference @xmath90 .",
    "this implies that @xmath91 holds for all @xmath92 .",
    "we have @xmath93 where for simplicity we have used the notation @xmath94 to denote + @xmath95 .",
    "let @xmath96,\\quad d_{t}(s)=\\bigg[\\frac{\\partial f^{i}_{t}}{\\partial x^{j}}(s)\\bigg]_{i , j=1}^{m}.\\ ] ] the variational equation ( [ var - comp ] ) is written in matrix form , @xmath97    for the jacobian matrix , the following lemma is an immediate consequence of the hypothesis @xmath98 .",
    "[ lem1.1 ] @xmath99    namely , all rows of the jacobian matrix @xmath100_{i , j=1}^{m}$ ] evaluated on the synchronization manifold @xmath101 have the same sum , which is equal to @xmath102 .    as a special case ,",
    "if the time variation is driven by some dynamical system @xmath103 , then the variational system does not depend on the initial time @xmath104 , but only on @xmath105 .",
    "thus , the jacobian matrix can be written in the form @xmath106 , by which the variational system can be written as : @xmath107    in this paper , we first extend the concept of hajnal diameter to general matrices . a matrix with hajnal diameter less than one has the property of compressing the convex hull of @xmath108 .",
    "consequently , for an infinite sequence of time - varying jacobian matrices , the average compression rate can be used to verify synchronization .",
    "since the jacobian matrices have identical row sums , the ( skew ) projection along the diagonal synchronization direction can be used to define the projection joint spectral radius , which equals the hajnal diameter .",
    "furthermore , we show that the hajnal diameter is equal to the largest lyapunov exponent along directions transverse to the synchronization manifold ; hence , it can also be used to determine whether the coupled system ( [ general ] ) can be synchronized .",
    "secondly , we apply these results to discuss the synchronization of the cml with time - varying couplings .",
    "as we shall show , the hajnal diameter of infinite coupling stochastic matrices can be utilized to measure the synchronizability of the coupling process .",
    "more precisely , the coupled system ( [ tvcmls ] ) synchronizes if the sum of the logarithm of the hajnal diameter and the largest lyapunov exponent of the uncoupled system is negative . using the equivalence of the hajnal diameter ,",
    "projection joint spectral radius , and transverse lyapunov exponents , we study some particular examples for which the hajnal diameter can be computed , including static coupling , a finite coupling set , and a multiplicative ergodic stochastic matrix process .",
    "we also present numerical examples to illustrate our theoretical results .",
    "the connection structure of the cml ( [ cmls ] ) naturally gives rise to a graph , where each unit can be regarded as a vertex .",
