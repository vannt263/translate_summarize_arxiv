    "when two , massless , color sextet quarks are added to qcd ( with six , massless , triplet quarks already present ) we obtain  @xcite a special version of qcd that we call @xmath1 .",
    "particular infra - red and ultra - violet properties of qcd@xmath2 allow the high - energy behavior to be constructed via the reggeon diagrams of `` @xmath3 '' , in which su(3 ) color is broken to su(2 ) .",
    "`` non - perturbative '' amplitudes appear via chiral anomalies occuring in reggeon effective vertices that contain triangle    = 5.8 in    diagrams , generated as illustrated in figure 1 . with",
    "a @xmath4 cut - off , vector ward identities are violated for the anomaly vertices and `` wee gluon '' infra - red divergences occur coupled to anomaly poles .",
    "the divergence of color zero , anomalous color parity ( @xmath5 ) gluons is preserved to all orders .",
    "factorizing off the divergence as a `` wee gluon condensate '' goldstone boson anomaly pole `` pions '' are selected as physical states and the simplest @xmath6 scattering diagrams have the form shown in figure 2 . within each anomaly",
    "vertex there is a zero momentum chirality transition or , equivalently , a dirac sea shift .",
    "the exchanged pomeron is a massive ( reggeized ) gluon in a wee gluon condensate ( with , in higher - orders , supercritical rft interactions . )",
    "su(3 ) color is restored via the critical pomeron phase transition ( asymptotic freedom properties of @xmath7 are crucial ) .",
    "the wee gluon condensate disappears and the dirac sea shifting becomes dynamical .",
    "the physical states all originate as goldstone bosons in @xmath3 .",
    "there are triplet mesons and nucleons , sextet `` pions '' ( @xmath8 s ) and `` nucleons ''  ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "there are no hybrid sextet / triplet states and no glueballs .",
    "there is also no bfkl pomeron and no odderon .",
    "wee gluons in the scattering states produce interactions that mix anomaly poles with exchanged electroweak vector bosons and generate a mass .",
    "this mass appears only in the s - matrix and only for vectors with a left - handed coupling .",
    "no photon ( or gluon ) mass is generated . for a sextet quark loop @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a wee gluon momentum .",
    "sextet quarks dominate because of larger color factors and the casimir scaling rule ( @xmath14 with @xmath15 ) implies that @xmath16 can consistently be the electroweak scale .",
    "the large wee gluon coupling implies the pomeron couples very strongly ( @xmath17 ) to sextet quarks .",
    "evidence for the sextet sector may , perhaps , have already been seen at hera and fermilab .",
    "an anomaly pole @xmath8 can be produced via a large @xmath4 `` hard interaction '' of the pomeron with a color neutral @xmath18 , @xmath19 , or @xmath20 .",
    "the diffractive dis amplitude is strongly enhanced by the anomaly when @xmath4 is electroweak scale , and so , the largest @xmath21 ( @xmath22 )   event seen by zeus ( before 97 ) could be diffractive production of a @xmath19 .",
    "different methods for reconstruction of the event give significantly different results ( outside the errors ) and the disagreement could result from a large jet mass .",
    "consistency is achieved if the jet has a mass squared of @xmath23 suggesting that a massive @xmath19 jet was indeed produced .",
    "diffractive ( sextet pion ) hard vertices will also appear when a @xmath19 , @xmath20 , or @xmath24 , is emitted from a quark in a hadron , but cross - sections will be relatively small and not easy to detect .",
    "diffractive production of a @xmath25 or @xmath26 pair via a double anomaly pole vertex may give a detectable cross - section . an excess @xmath27 cross - section ( 2 events )",
    "was apparently observed at the @xmath28 by ua1 and should , presumably , be also seen at the tevatron .",
    "double pomeron production of @xmath27 is probably not observable below lhc energies , but @xmath29 might be seen .",
    "the @xmath30 mixes with a pure glue state and could be responsible for @xmath31 production .",
    "if so , @xmath32 is a sextet scale and @xmath33 evolution should stop at @xmath34 , giving a jet excess just as in figure 3 .",
    "\\a ) = 2.5 in = 1.5 in b ) = 1.5 in",
    "because of the casimir effect , the sextet sector will constitute a stronger coupling sector of @xmath1 .",
    "inclusive pomeron amplitudes will give the largest effect and , above an effective threshold , sextet states will start to dominate the inelastic x - section .",
    "in particular multiple @xmath20 and @xmath19 production will cover most of the rapidity axis - in analogy with low - energy pion production . because of the absence of hybrid triplet / sextet states , the sextet neutron ( the @xmath10 ) will be stable and , at high energy",
    ", will be the dominant stable state produced .",
    "( if @xmath35 then , we expect , @xmath36 . ) @xmath37 production will dominate the formation of matter in the early universe and form cold dark matter , as ( sextet ) nuclei , clumps , etc .",
    "evidence for the energy scale at which the dominance of sextet states appears , may be provided by cosmic ray data .",
    "the `` knee '' in the cosmic ray spectrum is an extraordinary phenomenon and suggests a major strong interaction change between tevatron and lhc energies .",
    "a production threshold for particles not observed at ground level would lead to an underestimation of energies above the threshold , and produce a knee via the pile - up of events below the threshold energy and a depletion of the spectrum above the threshold .",
    "however , a major part of the x - section must be involved , as would be the case for the sextet threshold .",
    "multiple @xmath20 and @xmath19 production will give a huge increase of the large @xmath38 jet cross - section implying that an unexpectedly large fraction of shower particles will be undetected .",
    "there will also be a much larger fraction of ( undetected ) neutrinos and , at high enough energy , dark matter ( @xmath10 ) production will take away a major part of the energy . in detail",
    ", the knee suggests that , at the lhc , the new physics should contribute @xmath39 of the hadronic cross - section .",
    "many other effects seen in cosmic ray showers , with energies above the knee , also suggest new physics appears .",
    "in particular , the production of dijets ( core pairs ) is orders of magnitude above the qcd prediction .",
    "also ultra high - energy events with @xmath40 ( exceeding the gzk cut - off ) are not understood . since @xmath10 s",
    "avoid the gzk cut - off ( because they are both neutral and massive ) , and have large high - energy hadronic cross - sections , they could be reponsible . if this is the case , the mysteries of dark matter , the knee , and the ultra high - energy events would all have a common origin .",
    "via anomaly pole amplitudes , the hard double pomeron production of electroweak vector bosons gives jet cross - sections comparable with normal qcd jet ( non - diffractive ) cross - sections , with the boson pair cross - section estimated to be , roughly , twelve orders of magnitude larger than in the standard model . combining this estimate with pomeron regge theory , gives a small transverse momentum cross - section that is correspondingly large . during the initial `` soft physics ''",
    "running period of the lhc , it should be straightforward to look for vector boson pairs in the cms central detector , produced in combination with scattered protons in the totem roman pots .",
    "as discussed above , there will be very large inclusive cross - sections for sextet states , across most of the rapidity axis .",
    "multiple vector boson production will give jet cross - sections , at very large transverse momentum , that will be orders of magnitude larger than expected . the production cross - section for sextet nucleon pairs",
    "should also be hadronic in size , although stable sextet neutrons ( dark matter ! ) may be difficult to detect .",
    "if the sextet nucleon double pomeron cross - section is extraordinarily large , it might be detectable in the low luminosity run .",
    "if not , it might be seen by the high luminosity detectors that will look for double pomeron production of the standard model higgs particle .",
    "the @xmath1 fixed point implies that , well above the electroweak scale , @xmath41 and so supersymmetry is not required for unification ! a priori , unification could also determine how the ( short - distance ) @xmath42 sextet sector anomaly is canceled , as well as providing an origin for masses .",
    "many years ago ( with kyungsik kang ) we found a remarkable , but puzzling , result .",
    "we looked at asymptotically free , anomaly - free .",
    "left - handed unified theories that contain the sextet sector , we discovered that a unique theory is selected , i.e. @xmath43 gauge theory with the fermion representation @xmath44 ( @xmath45 gut@xmath2 ) .",
    "amazingly , the triplet quark and lepton sectors , which were not asked for , are remarkably close to the standard model .",
    "there are three `` generations '' of quarks / anti - quarks , with quark charges @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and three `` generations '' of @xmath48 doublet ( @xmath49 singlet ) leptons .",
    "the puzzle is that the @xmath42 quantum numbers are almost , but not quite , right and there are also ( apparently unwanted ) color octet quarks with lepton - like electroweak quantum numbers . at the time , we considered various `` anomalous fermion phenomena '' , but found no convincing dynamical route to the standard model .",
    "in fact , gut@xmath2 has , essentially , the same infra - red and ultra - violet properties as massless @xmath1 . as a result",
    "the high - energy s - matrix can also be constructed via reggeon diagram anomaly interactions .",
    "although an infra - red fixed - point keeps the @xmath43 coupling very small , reggeon infra - red divergences will confine @xmath43 color in the s - matrix .",
    "hence , _ all elementary fermions will be massless and confined and the dirac sea will control the dynamics , _ but with a crucial difference from qcd@xmath2 . in gut@xmath2 , left - handed fermion interactions will exponentiate the initial anomalous color parity divergences that lead to the states and amplitudes of qcd@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , these divergences _ will only be produced by the @xmath50 vector part of the theory _ and will lead to the dominance of this sector in the s - matrix .",
    "the left - handed vector bosons , with no su(3 ) color , will aquire a mass , as described in in section 3 and there will be a related bound - state mass spectrum in which , because of the fermion representation structure , there will be no ( unwanted ) symmetries .",
    "as yet , very little is certain , but an initial study suggests that the states and interactions of the standard model could be generated within the gut@xmath2 s - matrix ( with the octet quarks essential for generating bound - state leptons ) .",
    "if the standard model does , indeed , emerge in this manner it will be crucial that ( as we have seen in qcd@xmath2 ) the infra - red chiral anomaly effects of a massless dirac sea can produce a bound - state s - matrix with dramatically different properties from those implied , at first sight , by the underlying field theory ."
