    "[ sec : intro ]    gauge theories compactified on a circle or a torus appear in various different physical contexts .",
    "for instance , the reduction on a circle from four to three dimensions is relevant for studying the finite temperature effects , while toroidal compactification from @xmath3 to four dimensions provides the simplest possible toy model for extra dimensional theories .",
    "the components of the gauge field along the compact dimensions appear as scalars in the effective field theory for the non  compact space .",
    "imposing periodic boundary conditions , these scalars contain a massless zero mode .",
    "it has been known for a long time that these massless modes are lifted by radiative corrections  @xcite : in a yang ",
    "mills theory compactified on the circle @xmath4 it is possible to write a gauge invariant mass term and so we expect to find a non - zero 1loop correction @xmath5 that vanishes in the limit @xmath6 .",
    "the quantum mass corrections to the zero and higher kaluza ",
    "klein modes were thoroughly studied in the context of extra  dimensional field theories  @xcite , with particular attention towards phenomenological applications , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "however this effective field theory approach has some shortfalls : since a higher dimensional field theory is non ",
    "renormalizable , a sensitivity to the uv physics can appear which depends on the regularization scheme ; moreover it is not entirely clear how to treat rigorously the sum over the kaluza ",
    "klein modes .",
    "different approaches for computing the vacuum polarization have been proposed and seem to give mostly consistent results , see e.g. refs .",
    "the finiteness of the scalar mass can also be obtained in the effective potential approach , as discussed in ref .",
    "the equivalence of the two approaches and a first step towards a two  loop calculation were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we want to explore dimensional reduction as a tool for defining extended supersymmetric theories .",
    "in particular we try to find new hints for defining extended supersymmetry on the lattice without fine  tuning . in order to obtain some quantitative information ,",
    "we concentrate on the 1loop corrections to the mass of the adjoint scalar field that is obtained from the zero mode of the gauge field component along a compactified direction , and try to disentangle the high  energy ( i.e. cut  off scale ) contributions from the low  energy ones .",
    "insight on this problem is obtained by considering the quantum corrections to the mass of the kaluza ",
    "klein zero modes in two different uv completions of yang  mills : string theory and lattice field theory . as we shall see below",
    ", both cases are concrete examples of finite theories , where explicit and unambiguous computations can be performed .",
    "even though the computational techniques are different in the two cases , a clear physical picture emerges from the comparison of the two computations : the leading order correction to the scalar mass is universal and agrees with the result obtained from an effective field theory computation .",
    "the string theory computation is most easily compared with the quantum field theory one if the latter is performed using the background field method and a schwinger ",
    "time regularization , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the setup for the background field calculation is discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : qft ] .",
    "however our goal in this work is to obtain a quantitative result for the string and lattice theory computations ; we summarize the effective field theory computation mainly to set - up a common notation and facilitate the comparison .",
    "our results in sect .",
    "[ sec : qft ] agree with the well  known results in refs .",
    "@xcite for the mass renormalization of the scalar mode , thereby providing a new consistency check . in string theory",
    "we follow the procedure outlined in refs .  @xcite and relate the mass shift @xmath5 to the correlator of two vertex operators .",
    "note that the string computation requires a prescription to regulate the divergences that appear when the two vertices are very close on the world - sheet .",
    "these divergences are automatically regulated when the soft insertions of the external states are resummed and one derives the radiative mass corrections from the effective action , as done in refs .",
    "even if this approach is very efficient for untwisted string states such ours , it can not be applied to the case of twisted states .",
    "thus it is interesting to follow refs .",
    "@xcite , as we do , and extract the mass renormalization from the two  point function ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an application of this approach in the context of closed string theory ) . with the proper prescription for the short  distances divergences on the world ",
    "sheet , we verify that the mass corrections to the components of the gauge field in the non ",
    "compactfied dimensions vanish , as dictated by the four  dimensional gauge symmetry . having regulated these divergences ,",
    "the string theory techniques are readily extended to the case of compact space  time dimensions . in close analogy with the non  compact case , we find that the string calculation is easily mapped into the quantum field theory calculation and there is quantitative agreement between the two approaches when the string scale is much lower than the compactification scale ( @xmath7 ) .    in order to study the theory defined on a discrete space ",
    "time lattice , we generalize the techniques developed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of finite  temperature field theories .",
    "again , when the lattice scale @xmath8 is much lower than the compactification scale , the mass generated by radiative corrections for the component of the gauge field in the compact dimension is found to be identical to the one obtained in the effective theory calculation and thus to the string theory one in the regime @xmath7 .",
    "notice that the lattice and the string theory calculations deal with the sum over the kaluza - klein modes in a very different way : the string uv completion provides a setup where the so - called kaluza - klein regularization is implemented in a consistent way and the sums run over _ all _ the modes ; on the contrary , lattice gauge theory provides a gauge invariant way of implementing a hard cutoff on the integrals and sums and only modes of energies up to @xmath9 are considered .",
    "the fact that these two different approaches yield the same result in the limit @xmath10 suggests that all uv completions that respect locality and gauge invariance yield a leading order contribution to the scalar mass that is completely captured by an effective field theory approach .",
    "the physical reason is that the high  energy modes in the uv completion see the extra  dimensions as uncompact and so do not contribute to the mass renormalization because of the higher  dimensional gauge symmetry .",
    "we find that a similar pattern holds also for the 1loop contribution of fermions in lattice perturbation theory .",
    "the fermionic contribution can actually be written in a form that is very close to the bosonic one . as a consequence , we find that the leading terms in the bosonic and fermionic contributions to the mass renormalization of the adjoint scalar field cancel whenever the number of degrees of freedom are equal .",
    "hence the mass renormalization of the scalar field is highly suppressed if a supersymmetric theory is dimensionally reduced .",
    "our computation provides an explicit one  loop realization of the mechanism suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , and supports the interesting possibility that yang ",
    "mills theories with extended supersymmetry can be defined on the lattice without any fine ",
    "tuning by dimensional reduction of a higher dimensional @xmath11 theory , exactly as it happens in the continuum case  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : qft ] introduces the main ingredients in the calculation of the quantum corrections to the masses of the kaluza ",
    "klein zero modes , and derives the usual formula for the mass shifts in a new effective field theory framework , namely in the background field method with a schwinger ",
    "time regularization .",
    "the details of the string computation are described in section  [ sec : string ] .",
    "section  [ sec : latt ] deals with the details of the lattice computation , for the cases of bosonic and fermionic contributions in the loops .",
    "the possibility of an accidental extended supersymmetric is discussed at the end of section  [ sec : latt ] .",
    "the main results of this work are summarized in the conclusion together with some open questions that could be addressed in future works .",
    "[ sec : qft ]    this section concentrates on the study of the mass renormalization in the @xmath12 yang  mills gauge theory using the background field method in a space  time with compactified dimensions .",
    "we shall see below that even though our calculations are performed in a different setting , they reproduce the results that have already appeared in the literature .",
    "the correspondence between quantum field theory and string computations is apparent when amplitudes are expressed in terms of schwinger parameters and an explicit mapping can be defined to relate the string moduli and the schwinger parameters , see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "we shall therefore use the schwinger parametrization in order to emphasize the connection with the string theory approach .",
    "a similar approach has recently been developed in ref .",
    "clearly , before considering any explicit computation , the gauge invariance of the theory should be used to constrain the form of the 2-gluon correlator .",
    "this is most easily done in a path integral approach and by using brs invariance , see for instance  @xcite . in configuration space",
    ", this 2-point function must satisfy the ward identity @xmath13 where , in a @xmath3-dimensional theory , @xmath14 .",
    "if all dimensions are uncompact this leads to the usual conclusion that the gluon self - energy is transverse and no mass term can be generated .",
    "we will see this feature arising explicitly in our 1-loop computation . in a toroidal compactification",
    "the situation is different .",
    "since we focus on the case of vanishing wilson lines , all fields are periodic around the compact dimension and the associated momenta are discrete .",
    "thus for the kaluza - klein zero modes , eq .   reduces to a constraint involving only the gluon polarizations along the _ uncompact _ directions , since these modes have a non - zero momentum only along these directions .",
    "the mass correction of the other components ( which are scalars from the lower dimensional point of view ) is not constrained by any symmetry and can only be determined by performing an explicit computation .",
    "let us notice that for the _ higher _ kaluza - klein modes these ward identities yield again non - trivial constraints on the quantum mass corrections , see section  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite , where this point is discussed in detailed .",
    "quantitative informations on the renormalization of zero - modes mass can only be obtained by explicit calculations .",
    "we consider first the case of a @xmath3-dimensional theory , without compact dimensions , in order to set up our framework , and check indeed the symmetry constraints are satisfied .",
    "starting from the feynman rules detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we compute the sum of one - loop diagrams contributing to the gauge boson two - point function at zero external momentum . in a @xmath3dimensional theory , without compact dimensions , there are four diagrams ( as opposed to three in standard yang  mills theories , as a result of an extra feynman rule of two - ghost two - gluon interaction ) , and their contributions are shown below : @xmath15 the sum of these amplitudes amounts to @xmath16~.\\ ] ] we suppress colour indices , which appear only in a delta function .",
    "this quantity is ultra - violet divergent and needs to be properly regularized in order to evaluate the mass corrections .",
    "the gauge coupling @xmath17 has mass dimension @xmath18=\\frac{4-d}{2}$ ] , and so any divergence contained in this amplitude which is to contribute to a mass shift of the gauge boson must have mass dimension @xmath19 . in four dimensions",
    "this is a quadratic divergence .    in dimensional regularization",
    ", the divergence appears as a factor @xmath20 , which has a first pole at @xmath21 . however , using the recursion relation for gamma functions , this can be transformed into a factor @xmath22 ( because of the appearance of a @xmath23 factor before the integral ) which has its first pole at @xmath24 as expected for a logarithmic divergence in four dimensions .    in this work",
    "a cutoff on the schwinger time is used to regulate the divergences .",
    "this is again in order to compare in a straightforward way with perturbative string theory calculations , but also so that we can extract the divergences as powers of a mass - scale @xmath25 which , while we associate it with a momentum cut - off for the theory , does not break the gauge invariance .",
    "this procedure involves the exponentiation of the propagators in the momentum integrals using : @xmath26 where the variable @xmath27 is termed a schwinger - time parameter . as an example",
    ", this procedure yields for a tadpole diagram : @xmath28 which is a divergent integral .",
    "the divergences arise from the @xmath29 region of the integral , where there is no exponential damping of the contribution from large momenta in the above expression , and so we can regulate by imposing a lower bound @xmath30 on the integration variable @xmath27 . doing this",
    "we see that the divergence appears in the result as a factor @xmath31 and so , as we expect , this divergence is of mass dimension @xmath32 . in order to associate the lower bound on the schwinger - time with a momentum cut - off @xmath25 , we write @xmath33 .",
    "thus the two integrals contained in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sum ] ) amount to @xmath34 inserting this result into eq .",
    "( [ eq : sum ] ) we see that the two terms cancel and the expression vanishes as required by gauge invariance .",
    "let us now examine the effects of compactification on this cancellation .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case where we compactify one of the @xmath3 dimensions , leaving an effective theory in @xmath35 dimensions .",
    "the resulting effective theory consists of a @xmath36 component gauge boson , and a scalar field in the adjoint representation arising from the extra - dimensional component of the original @xmath3 component gauge field .",
    "the momentum of the fields in the finite compactified dimension produces a tree  level mass for an infinite tower of fields called kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes .",
    "the gauge coupling is rescaled by @xmath37 .",
    "the zero mode gauge boson does not receives any 1loop mass renormalization after compactification since the computation of the 2point function is basically the one discussed above .",
    "the adjoint scalar however , does , as expected due to the breaking of the original gauge invariance .",
    "we will illustrate this here , and confirm agreement with the result obtained in ref .",
    "note that in ref .",
    "@xcite the relevant two - point functions are computed not at zero external momentum @xmath38 , but in the approximation @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the kk mass of the external particle . as a result of the poisson resummation used to compute the sum over kk modes , inverse powers of the kk mode of the external particle",
    "are generated , which can yield extra contributions to the final result which would be missed in the @xmath41 limit .",
    "this only affects the result for @xmath42 external modes however , and therefore we can work at @xmath41 for our purposes .    by keeping a generic non - vanishing external momentum @xmath43 for the zero modes",
    ", it would be possible to compute higher - derivative terms in the low - energy effective action which can be relevant in phenomenological applications  @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper , we focus on the mass correction terms which represent the most relevant contributions in the infrared , and which are most easily computed both in string theory and in the lattice field theory approach .",
    "in computing the contributions to the scalar two - point function at zero momentum , there are two integrals , summed over kaluza - klein modes , which arise .",
    "these are @xmath44 with @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an integer denotes the mass of a kk mode , and the sum over @xmath47 is a sum over the integers @xmath46 .",
    "there are seven diagrams contributing to the two - point function for the adjoint scalar field ; they are shown in tab .",
    "[ fig:7diag ] with their contributions in terms of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    ".diagrams yielding the quantum corrections to the adjoint scalar mass . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     by using the feynman rules listed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain for the first diagram in fig .  [",
    "fig : latferm].a : @xmath50 \\frac{1}{d^f_n } ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the index of the fermion representation , @xmath52 counts the physical polarizations of the fermion and @xmath53 is the wilson propagator @xmath54 the contribution of the tadpole diagram ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : latferm].b ) is @xmath55 by combining the two diagrams we obtain an expression that has a structure similar to eq .",
    "@xmath56.\\ ] ] then we will follow the same approach used in computing the bosonic loop : we start by focusing on the first term and rewrite it in terms of the variation of the fermionic propagator @xmath57 @xmath58 where we have discarded all the terms that sum up to zero due to the periodicities of the trigonometric functions .",
    "the we can rewrite   as follow @xmath59 we can now use   and `` integrate '' by parts the first term in the parenthesis . in this way",
    "we see that it precisely cancels the second term in  .",
    "thus the full 2-point amplitude is @xmath60 as in the previous section we can rewrite this sum as a contour integral . before doing this , it is convenient to rewrite the propagator for the wilson fermion in the following form @xmath61~.\\ ] ] in this way the fermionic result   will take a form that is very similar to the one encountered in the bosonic case .",
    "in particular the first parenthesis combines with the other @xmath62 s in   and the contour integral we find has the same analytical structure as   @xmath63 where @xmath64 has poles at @xmath65 with @xmath66 thus we have now rewritten the 1loop fermionic contribution in the same form as encountered in the bosonic computation and the only difference is in the explicit relation between the position of the poles and the momenta @xmath67 . thus the 1loop fermion contribution to the scalar mass is @xmath68~.\\ ] ] as we have already seen , in the large @xmath69 limit , only the low energy momenta contribute significantly to this integral @xmath70 .",
    "then we can expand   for small @xmath67 s and we see that , for low energy momenta , we have again @xmath71 . thus , in this limit , the fermion contribution to the scalar mass reduces to the result derived in the effective field theory  @xcite @xmath72      even if our lattice analysis has been restricted to perturbation theory , the results of this section suggest the exciting possibility of realizing sym theories with extended supersymmetry on the lattice in an accidental way . as is well known , lattice regularization breaks most of the symmetries of the poincar group and all supersymmetries that are present in the continuum version of the same theory .",
    "however poincar symmetries arise automatically in the continuum limit , because all relevant or marginal operators that could violate them are prohibited by some of the symmetries that are present in the theory at finite lattice spacing .",
    "a similar observation applies also to the four dimensional @xmath73 sym theory  @xcite : if one adds to the standard yang ",
    "mills theory a _ chiral _",
    "fermion in the adjoint representation , then no dangerous operator , such as a mass term for the fermions , can be dynamically generated and , at low energies , one automatically recovers a supersymmetric theory .",
    "of course from a lattice prospective the challenging aspect of this program is to simulate dynamical chiral fermions .    in the case of extended supersymmetry",
    "an additional complication arises : even pure sym contains scalars ( the complex scalar of the vector multiplet ) .",
    "once supersymmetry is broken by the lattice regularization , one expects that a relevant mass term for these scalars is dynamically generated and thus apparently there is no hope to get a supersymmetric theory at low energies without fine tuning  @xcite .",
    "this is indeed the case if the scalars are described by site variables in a four dimensional lattice .",
    "various approaches have been suggested to overcome this problem , such as deconstruction , or the idea of realizing some of the supersymmetric generators at finite lattice spacing , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , a recent review with extensive bibliographic references can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the results of this section suggests a different possibility : one can use the kaluza - klein reduction on the lattice to engineer four dimensional sym theories with extended supersymmetries from a higher dimensional @xmath73 theory .",
    "after all , also in the continuum field theories , this is the easiest way to construct sym theories with extended supersymmetry  @xcite . in this approach",
    "the scalar fields are the internal components of the higher dimensional gauge field and so are described by link variables in the compact directions of a higher dimensional asymmetric lattice .",
    "then , at distances shorter than the compactification scale @xmath0 , the scalar fields and the gauge field are on the same footing and both are constrained by the higher dimensional gauge invariance .",
    "thus no dangerous contribution to the mass of the scalar fields can come from the high energy modes ( i.e. modes with energies bigger than @xmath74 ) . on the contrary the quantum corrections to the scalar mass are purely due to finite size effects and only modes with energies lower than @xmath74 can contribute . in the limit @xmath75 , these modes are completely blind to the effects of the lattice regulator and thus to the supersymmetry breaking effects of the regularized theory .",
    "this is clearly visible in eqs .   and  :",
    "when @xmath76 the two expressions reduce to those obtained in the continuum effective field theory and thus they cancel when expected .",
    "the overall normalization in these results basically counts the number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom that can contribute to the mass corrections .",
    "for instance , if we choose @xmath77 and two compact dimensions , there is a fermion / boson degeneracy and we obtain @xmath78 sym . for two compact dimensions",
    "one of the integrals in   and   becomes a sum , however the mechanism described here still applies : the leading order contribution is independent of the lattice spacing and cancel between fermion and boson loops when expected . ] .",
    "thus there is hope to describe extended sym theories on the lattice without having to fine tune the scalar masses by using a higher dimensional lattice with a different number of sites in the compact and uncompact dimension . for scales that are bigger than the compactification radius , but smaller that the size of the `` uncompact '' dimensions ( @xmath79 ) the lattice theory should reduce to a standard four dimensional gauge theory .",
    "of course an obvious drawback of this approach is that simulations might be very expensive when the number of dimensions of the lattice is big ( for instance , we would need 6 compact dimensions to simulate @xmath80 sym ) .",
    "moreover there are several points that require further study in order to see whether this proposal can be realized in a practical way .",
    "a first obvious question is whether the pattern we described is general or is just a peculiarity of the 1loop perturbation theory .",
    "there are actually some indications that this mechanism is indeed general .",
    "the distinction between high energy modes , constrained by the higher dimensional gauge invariance , and the low energy ones , constrained by the tree - level supersymmetry , does not seem to rely on the 1loop approximation .",
    "so one would expect that the higher loop radiative corrections to the scalar mass follow the same pattern and the leading contribution in the large @xmath0 limit is independent of the uv cutoff .",
    "indications in this sense come from the string analysis , where the 1loop case is not special .",
    "a more fundamental question to be addressed is to check whether this approach can be used to study the strongly coupled regime of an @xmath81 supersymmetric theory on the lattice .",
    "doubts in this respect were raised in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was noticed that , starting from a weakly - coupled six - dimensional theory , the dynamically generated scale in four dimensions @xmath82 is exponentially suppressed in the large @xmath69 limit . in this case , the @xmath8-dependent corrections to eqs .  ,   are likely to spoil the accidental supersymmetry at the scale @xmath82 .",
    "however a _ strongly coupled _ six - dimensional starting point is needed in order to take a continuum limit of the lattice description which keeps the radius @xmath0 and the four dimensional coupling @xmath83 finite .",
    "thus the problem mentioned above does not appear in the scaling limit that is relevant to study of a fixed four dimensional supersymmetric physics .",
    "another open question concerns the other types of fine tuning that might be necessary in order to recover a theory with extended supersymmetry .",
    "for instance , one would expect to fine tune the quartic coupling among scalars and the yukawa couplings so that they are all related to the gauge coupling constant .",
    "the interplay between higher dimensional gauge invariance and tree - level supersymmetry described here should be helpful also to avoid the fine tuning of the couplings .    on a more practical side",
    ", one should worry about the subleading corrections to eqs .   and  .",
    "these corrections will certainly spoil the low energy supersymmetry and we can suppress them only in the large @xmath69 limit which is of course computationally very expensive .",
    "if these corrections are small for a moderate number of lattice points in the compact dimensions , then this approach can be really transformed into a practical tool for analyzing @xmath84 or even @xmath80 sym on the lattice . some indications in this direction",
    "come from  @xcite , where it is pointed out that already for @xmath85 the lattice artifact effects are only of the order of @xmath86 .",
    "[ sec : concl ]    in this paper we studied the quantum corrections to the mass of the internal components of the gauge field in kaluza - klein compactifications . within an effective field approach this problem was analyzed in detail in refs .",
    "the main feature of this result is that it depends only on the compactification scale @xmath0 and is independent of the uv cutoff @xmath25 necessary to define the higher dimensional gauge theory ( of course we assume @xmath87 ) .",
    "even if this is the case , it is natural to wonder whether an effective field theory approach is reliable , since one is summing over the whole tower of kaluza - klein states which at a certain point will have masses bigger that then uv cutoff itself . in order to answer this question",
    "we studied the same problem in two different uv finite theories : string theory and lattice gauge theories . in the first case",
    "the uv cutoff is set by the string length @xmath88 , while in the second case the same role is played by the lattice spacing @xmath8 ; both these theories represent local and gauge invariant uv completions of higher dimensional yang  mills theories .",
    "the interesting result is that , in the regime @xmath89 , both the lattice and the string computations reproduce exactly the same result found in field theory , thus justifying a posteriori the approach used in refs .",
    "this analysis clarifies also the mechanism that protects the effective field theory results from the contributions of the modes with an energy of the order of the uv cutoff : since @xmath89 , these very energetic modes see all dimensions on the same footing and the constraints of the higher dimensional gauge invariance should be taken into account .",
    "thus , if we want to compute radiative corrections to terms that would violate the higher dimensional gauge invariance , we do not really need to know the uv details of the string or lattice theories .",
    "it is sufficient to know that these uv completions respect locality and gauge invariance and this ensures that the leading order contribution to these terms is completely captured by an effective field theory approach . by carrying out the computation in the full uv finite theory ,",
    "we see explicitly that the suppression of the uv modes is of the order of @xmath90 ( or @xmath91 ) , while the contribution of the low energy modes reproduces the expected effective field theory result .    the string analysis can be relevant for phenomenological applications in the context of models with large extra dimensions . in particular it would be interesting to generalize our computation to the amplitudes involving external states with a non - zero kaluza - klein charge .",
    "this case has been discussed in detail from the field theory point of view  @xcite .",
    "the string analysis can either support the picture emerging from the field theory computations or maybe indicate subtleties due to the high  energy modes .",
    "of course it would be interesting to carry out the same quantitative analysis in the case of tachyon free string theory",
    ". this might be directly useful in in the string phenomenological scenarios where the standard model is engineered on d - branes , which usually contain non - chiral exotic matter fields .    in the context of lattice gauge theories",
    "the problem of the radiative corrections to the kaluza - klein scalars is interesting because of its connection with the possibility of obtaining an accidentally supersymmetric theory at low energies .",
    "this is why we have considered explicitly also the contribution of ( wilson ) fermions . even if technically the computation is more involved than its bosonic counterpart , we do not find any particular surprise and the pattern described in section  [ sec : latt ] arises .",
    "there is certainly the need of more study to see whether this proposal can be turned into a concrete approach to supersymmetry on the lattice . in general",
    ", we hope that setups suggested by d - brane constructions and/or compactifications can provide useful suggestions on how to realize supersymmetric theories on the lattice also beyond the case of super yang ",
    "mills . of course it would be very interesting to try and include also chiral multiplets and construct a lattice realization of more complicated supersymmetric theories .",

    "<S> mills theories contain a number of four dimensional scalars corresponding to the internal components of the gauge field . while at tree - level the scalar zero modes are massless , it is well known that quantum corrections make them massive . </S>",
    "<S> we compute these radiative corrections at 1loop in an effective field theory framework , using the background field method and proper schwinger  time regularization . in order to clarify the proper treatment of the sum over kk  </S>",
    "<S> modes in the effective field theory approach , we consider the same problem in two different uv completions of yang  mills : string theory and lattice field theory . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> when the compactification radius @xmath0 is much bigger than the scale of the uv completion ( @xmath1 ) , we recover a mass renormalization that is independent of the uv scale and agrees with the one derived in the effective field theory approach . </S>",
    "<S> these results support the idea that the value of the mass corrections is , in this regime , universal for any uv completion that respects locality and gauge invariance . </S>",
    "<S> the string analysis suggests that this property holds also at higher loops . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice analysis suggests that the mass of the adjoint scalars appearing in @xmath2 super yang  </S>",
    "<S> mills is highly suppressed , even if the lattice regularization breaks all supersymmetries explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to an interplay between the higher  dimensional gauge invariance and the degeneracy of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom .    </S>",
