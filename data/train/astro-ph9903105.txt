    "the discovery in the z - type low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) of @xmath01060  hz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) with centroid frequencies that are positively correlated with mass accretion rate ( van der klis et al .",
    "1985 ; see van der klis 1989 for a review ) has led to a significant improvement in our understanding of such systems . these horizontal - branch oscillations ( hbos ) , which are named after the branch in x - ray color - color diagrams where they appear , were the first rapid - variability phenomena discovered in lmxbs and have played a key role in organizing the complex phenomenology of these sources that has emerged over the past decade ( see , e.g. , hasinger & van der klis 1989 ; van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "very soon after the discovery of the hbo , its centroid frequency was identified with the difference between the keplerian frequency at the radius where the neutron star magnetosphere couples strongly to the gas in the accretion disk and the spin frequency of the neutron star ( alpar & shaham 1985 ; lamb et al .",
    "1985 ; shibazaki & lamb 1987 ) .",
    "this magnetospheric beat - frequency interpretation of the hbo was found to agree well with the observed properties of the hbos , including the dependence of the hbo frequency on x - ray countrate ( alpar & shaham 1985 ; lamb et al .",
    "1985 ; ghosh & lamb 1992 ) , the existence of correlated low - frequency noise ( lamb et al .",
    "1985 ; shibazaki & lamb 1987 ) , and the absence of any detectable qpo with a frequency equal to the keplerian frequency at the magnetic coupling radius ( lamb 1988 ) .",
    "the magnetospheric beat - frequency model predicted that the neutron stars in the z sources have spin frequencies @xmath5350  hz and magnetic field strengths @xmath1@xmath2  g ( see alpar & shaham 1985 ; ghosh & lamb 1992 ; wijnands et al .",
    "1996 ) , consistent with the hypothesis that these stars are the progenitors of the millisecond rotation - powered pulsars ( alpar & shaham 1985 ; see alpar et al .",
    "1982 ; radhakrishnan & shrinivasan 1982 ) .",
    "the neutron star properties inferred from the magnetospheric beat - frequency model have subsequently been shown to be consistent with the magnetic field strengths inferred from models of the x - ray spectra of the z sources ( psaltis , lamb , & miller 1995 ; psaltis & lamb 1998 ) and with the 290325  hz spin frequencies inferred from the frequency separation of the two simultaneous qpos with frequencies @xmath6  khz ( hereafter the kilohertz qpos ) and from the high - frequency oscillations observed during type  i x - ray bursts in other neutron - star lmxbs ( strohmayer et al . 1996 ; miller , lamb , & psaltis 1998 ; miller 1999 ) . if the upper kilohertz qpo is an orbital frequency in the inner disk , the magnetospheric beat - frequency model of the hbo requires that a small fraction of the gas in the accretion disk must penetrate to radii smaller than the radius where it initially couples to the stellar magnetic field ( van der klis et al .",
    "1997 ; see miller et al .",
    "1998 for a discussion ) , because observations show that the kilohertz qpos are present at the same time as the hbo ( see , e.g. , wijnands & van der klis 1998 ) .",
    "in addition to the hbos , the magnetospheric beat - frequency model has been used to explain successfully similar qpos observed in accretion - powered pulsars , where the neutron star spin frequency can be measured directly and the magnetic field strength can be estimated from the accretion torque , providing a stringent test of the model ( see , e.g. , angelini , stella , & parmar 1989 ; ghosh 1996 ; finger , wilson , & harmon 1996 ) .",
    "recently , stella & vietri ( 1998 ) have proposed an alternative hbo mechanism , motivated by concern about whether orbiting gas can penetrate inside the magnetic coupling radius in the z sources . in this model ,",
    "the magnetic field of the neutron star plays no role in generating the hbo . instead",
    ", the hbo observed in the z sources and the power - spectral peaks with frequencies @xmath760  hz seen in some atoll sources ( see , e.g. , ford & van der klis 1998 ) are both generated by nodal ( lense thirring and classical ) precession of a tilted ring of gas at a special radius in the inner disk .",
    "stella & vietri suggested that the nodal precession frequency of the ring is visible in x - rays because of the changes in the doppler shift of radiation from blobs orbiting in the ring , changes in occultations by such blobs , or the changing aspect of the ring seen by an observer .",
    "subsequently , markovi & lamb ( 1998 ) studied the normal modes of the inner disk and showed that typically @xmath8 high - frequency nodal precession modes are weakly damped .",
    "nodal precession has also been proposed by cui , zhang , & chen ( 1998 ; see also ipser 1996 ) as an explanation for the qpos observed in black hole candidates .",
    "if the hbo is generated by nodal precession at the same radius in the accretion disk where orbital motion generates the kilohertz qpo , as proposed by stella & vietri ( 1998 ) , then the hbo frequency , the neutron star spin frequency , and the frequency of the upper kilohertz qpo should satisfy a specific relation .",
    "the shape of this relation was shown to be consistent with observations of the hbo and kilohertz qpo frequencies observed in the z sources gx  17@xmath92 and gx  5@xmath101 ( stella 1997 ; stella & vietri 1997 , 1998 ; morsink & stella 1999 ) , although the predicted precession frequencies were found to be smaller than the observed hbo frequencies .",
    "in this paper we use data on five z sources obtained using the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) to investigate further the origin of the hbo .",
    "all of these data have been fully reported elsewhere .",
    "the sources we consider are gx  17@xmath92 ( wijnands et al .",

    "1997 ) . in all of these sources the hbo and two kilohertz",
    "qpos have been observed simultaneously . in gx  349@xmath92 ,",
    "the sixth originally identified z source , no hbo has so far been detected simultaneously with the kilohertz qpos ( kuulkers & van der klis 1998 ; zhang , strohmayer , & swank 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , we can not include this source in the present study .",
    "we investigate the magnetospheric beat - frequency model in  2 and the lense - thirring precession model in  3 , comparing their predictions with the available data . in ",
    "4 we summarize our conclusions and their implications for the properties of the neutron stars in the z sources .",
    "finally , we characterize the correlations between the various frequencies in a model - independent way in appendix  a , in order to facilitate comparison of the present data with future data or other theoretical models .",
    "in the magnetospheric beat - frequency model of the hbo ( alpar & shaham 1985 ; lamb et al .  1985 ) , the centroid frequency @xmath11 of the hbo is identified with the beat between the keplerian frequency @xmath12 at the radius @xmath13 where the neutron star magnetic field couples strongly to the gas in the accretion disk and the spin frequency @xmath14 of the neutron star .",
    "the frequency of this beat is @xmath15 ghosh & lamb ( 1992 ) computed the dependence of @xmath16 on the stellar mass and magnetic moment and the accretion rate for a variety of simple models of the inner accretion disk .",
    "they found that if the coupling radius is in an asymptotic region of the disk , then @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the magnetic moment of the neutron star in units of @xmath19  g  @xmath20 , @xmath21 is its gravitational mass in units of solar masses , @xmath22 is the mass accretion rate , and @xmath23 is the eddington critical mass accretion rate onto a neutron star of 10  km radius ; the proportionality constant @xmath24 and the exponents @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 in equation  ( [ mag ] ) are different for different models of the inner accretion disk and are listed in table  1 .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath28 describes the fraction of the mass flux through the inner disk that couples to the stellar magnetic field at @xmath13 and is introduced here to allow for the possibility that some of the gas in the disk does not couple to the stellar magnetic field at @xmath13 but instead penetrates to smaller radii , as required if the upper kilohertz qpo is an orbital frequency in the inner disk ( miller et al .",
    "1998 ) ; @xmath28 may depend on the mass accretion rate .    in the magnetospheric beat - frequency model of the hbo , the steep dependence of @xmath11 on the mass accretion rate inferred from the _ exosat _",
    "data implies that @xmath16 is small compared to @xmath29 and hence that the spin frequencies @xmath14 of the neutron stars in the z sources are very close to , but less than , @xmath29 ( alpar & shaham 1985 ; lamb et al .",
    "1995 ; ghosh & lamb 1992 ) . stated differently , the magnetospheric beat - frequency model of the hbo requires that the neutron stars in the z sources be near magnetic spin equilibrium .",
    "indeed , the 200350  hz spin frequencies predicted by the model ( see ghosh & lamb 1992 ) are much larger than the @xmath3050  hz hbo frequencies , as required .",
    "the similarity of the z - source spin frequencies predicted by the magnetospheric beat - frequency model to the spin frequencies inferred from the separation frequencies of the kilohertz qpos in the z sources lends further support to the model ( miller et al.1998 ) and to its implication that the neutron stars in the z sources are near magnetic spin equilibrium ( white & zhang 1997 ; psaltis & lamb 1998 ) .",
    "if they are , then their spin frequencies are given by ( ghosh & lamb 1979 , 1992 ) @xmath31 \\ ; ,    \\label{nueqm}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the critical fastness parameter and the angle brackets indicate an average over a time interval equal to the timescale on which the accretion torque changes the spin .    combining equations  ( [ mag ] ) and  ( [ nueqm ] ) and identifying @xmath11 with @xmath16",

    "\\label{nuind}\\ ] ] equation  ( [ nuind ] ) shows that the magnetospheric beat - frequency model of the hbo predicts that @xmath34 should be @xmath35 and hence only slightly larger than unity .",
    "the z sources are thought to be accreting at near - eddington accretion rates ( see lamb 1989 ; hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) . the inner accretion disk in these sources is therefore expected to be radiation - pressure - dominated , in which case @xmath36 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "hence , if @xmath28 depends only weakly on the instantaneous accretion rate @xmath37 , then @xmath38 will also depend only weakly on @xmath37 and possibly also on the magnetic field and mass of the neutron star , through the dependence of @xmath32 on these quantities ( any such dependence is expected to be weak ) .    according to the magnetospheric beat - frequency model , the hbo frequency @xmath11",
    "is related to the frequency @xmath39 of the upper kilohertz qpo only indirectly , through the dependence of both frequencies on the mass accretion rate . in all sources",
    "in which kilohertz qpos have so far been discovered , @xmath39 increases with inferred mass accretion rate ( see , e.g. , van der klis et al .",
    "1996 ; strohmayer et al.1996 ; van der klis 1998 ) . here",
    "we explore the consequences of the simple ansatz @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are constants that are specific to each source and may depend on the mass and magnetic field strength of the neutron star .",
    "this relation , with @xmath43 , is consistent with kilohertz qpo observations of several atoll sources , provided that the observed countrate from an atoll source is proportional to the mass accretion rate ( see , e.g. , strohmayer et al .  1996 ;",
    "ford et al .",
    "in all the z sources , @xmath39 is consistent with being @xmath44  hz when they are accreting at near - eddington rates , which implies @xmath45  hz , independent of the expected modest differences in the masses and magnetic field strengths of these neutron stars . using this simple ansatz , equation  ( [ mag ] )",

    "are needed .",
    "the hbo and kilohertz qpo frequencies are directly observed , but oscillations at the neutron star spin frequency have not yet been detected in the persistent emission of any z source .",
    "however , comparisons of the frequencies of the two simultaneous kilohertz qpos observed in the persistent emission of the atoll sources with the frequencies of the nearly coherent oscillations observed in these sources during type  i x - ray bursts indicate that the neutron star spin frequency is nearly equal to the frequency separation between the two kilohertz qpos ( strohmayer et al.1996 ; miller et al .  1998 ; strohmayer et al .",
    "1998 ; psaltis et al .",
    "1998 ; miller 1999 ) . hence ,",
    "for gx  17@xmath92 , gx  5@xmath101 , gx  340@xmath90 , and cyg  x-2 we set the spin frequency equal to the average frequency separation of the kilohertz qpos . in sco",
    "x-1 , the frequency separation of the kilohertz qpos is consistent with being constant at the lowest inferred accretion rates but decreases at higher rates ( van der klis et al .",
    "sco  x-1 is thought to be accreting at near - eddington mass accretion rates when the frequency separation of the kilohertz qpos decreases , and it is therefore plausible that this decrease is related to the effects of radiation forces on the dynamics of the accretion flow near the neutron star ( see , however , mndez et al .",
    "1998 ; psaltis et al .",
    "1998 ) . hence , in plotting the sco  x-1 data , we set the spin frequency equal to the nearly constant frequency separation of its kilohertz qpos at low inferred mass accretion rates .",
    "the spin frequencies we have adopted are listed in table  2 .",
    "relation  ( [ maghbo ] ) describes adequately ( @xmath52 per degree of freedom ) the dependence of the sum of the hbo and inferred spin frequencies on the frequency of the upper kilohertz qpo in the five z sources in our sample , considered separately .",
    "table  2 lists the best - fit parameters and their @xmath53 errors and figure  1 compares the best - fit relations with the frequency data on each source . if @xmath54 , the power - law index @xmath25 for all sources except sco  x-1 is @xmath55 .",
    "this value is consistent with the expectation that the z sources are accreting at near - eddington rates and hence that the inner accretion disk is optically thick and radiation - pressure - dominated ( see table  1 ) . for sco  x-1 ,",
    "however , a significantly weaker dependence of the hbo frequency on @xmath22 is required , if @xmath42 is independent of the mass accretion rate ( but see appendix  a and psaltis , belloni , & van der klis 1999 ) .",
    "figure  2 shows the quantity @xmath56 plotted as a function of the upper kilohertz qpo frequency @xmath39 for the five z sources in our sample .",
    "the frequency data on all the sources are consistent with a single , universal relation between @xmath11 , @xmath14 , and @xmath39 , as predicted by equation  ( [ nuindhbo ] ) , when @xmath39 is @xmath57  hz .",
    "this relation is shown as a solid line in figure  2 .",
    "figure  3 shows the confidence contours for the power - law index @xmath58 and the coefficient @xmath50 in relation  ( [ nuindhbo ] ) obtained by fitting this relation to all the data with @xmath59  hz . assuming that @xmath41 is @xmath60  hz",
    ", the best - fit value of @xmath50 gives a lower bound on the critical fastness @xmath32 , because @xmath61 is expected to be a monotonically increasing function of @xmath37 and hence @xmath62 .",
    "if the magnetospheric beat - frequency model is the correct explanation of the hbo , then @xmath32 is @xmath3 for the magnetic field strengths and accretion rates of the z sources .",
    "when @xmath39 is @xmath63  hz , the hbo frequencies of gx  17@xmath92 are up to 2% higher than predicted by extrapolating the universal relation that holds at lower frequencies , whereas those of sco  x-1 are as much as 5% lower .",
    "this indicates that there is at least one other important parameter that varies with @xmath39 .",
    "for example , the structure of the inner disk may change at high accretion rates , causing the exponent @xmath42 to vary from source to source .",
    "this conjecture can not be tested without a specific model for the variation in @xmath42 , because if @xmath42 is chosen to reproduce the behavior of the data , relation  ( [ nuindhbo ] ) looses all predictive power .",
    "the magnetospheric beat - frequency model of the hbo requires that the neutron stars in all the z sources be near magnetic spin equilibrium . the tight , universal correlation between the hbo , spin , and upper kilohertz qpo frequencies in all the z sources when @xmath64  hz is explained by the model if @xmath65 is approximately the same in all of them .",
    "all the z sources are thought to be accreting at very similar rates ( comparable to the eddington critical accretion rate ; see , e.g. , lamb 1989 ; hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) and hence @xmath66 is not expected to differ much from one to another .",
    "the critical fastness @xmath32 is expected to be comparable to unity and may be a universal constant for a given inner disk structure ( ghosh & lamb 1979 , 1992 ) .",
    "if so , then @xmath67 is nearly the same in the five z sources in our sample and hence the frequency of the upper kilohertz qpo is a good absolute measure of the mass accretion rate in these sources",
    ". stated differently , _ the relation between the upper kilohertz qpo frequency and the accretion rate appears to be very similar in all the z sources_.      the analysis presented in  2.1 demonstrates that if ( a )  the neutron stars in the z sources are spinning near their magnetic spin equilibrium rates , ( b )  the frequency separation between the upper and lower kilohertz qpos is approximately equal to the neutron - star spin frequency , ( c )  the inner accretion disk in the z sources is optically thick and radiation - pressure dominated , and ( d )  the upper kilohertz qpo frequency is proportional to the mass accretion rate through the inner disk , then the magnetospheric beat - frequency model is consistent with the observed behavior of the hbo frequency and , in particular , the tight , universal correlation ( figure  2 ) between the hbo and kilohertz qpo frequencies in all the z sources in our sample .",
    "all of these assumptions are expected to be satisfied , as discussed in  2.1 .    as noted earlier ,",
    "the magnetospheric beat - frequency model of the hbo is consistent with models for the upper kilohertz qpo that identify its frequency with an orbital frequency in the inner disk only if a small fraction of the accreting matter does not couple to the stellar magnetic field at the radius @xmath13 but instead remains in a geometrically thin keplerian disk down to the radius responsible for the upper kilohertz qpo ( i.e. , @xmath28 must be less than unity ; see van der klis 1998 ; miller et al .",
    "1998 ; and alpar & yilmaz 1997 for discussions ) .",
    "in particular , the interpretation of both the hbo and the two simultaneous kilohertz qpos as rotational beat phenomena requires that there be two distinct radii in the inner accretion disk at which beating of the neutron star spin frequency with the orbital frequency produces a qpo , as is the case , for example , in the sonic - point model ( miller et al .",
    "1998 ) .    assuming that the hbo is a magnetospheric beat - frequency phenomenon",
    ", we can use the observed hbo properties together with a general relation for the coupling radius to constrain the magnetic dipole moments of the neutron stars in the z sources in a way that is largely independent of the structure of the inner accretion disk . in the ghosh & lamb ( 1979 ) model of disk - magnetosphere interaction , the radius @xmath13 at which the stellar magnetic field strongly couples to the gas in the accretion disk is given implicitly by ( see ghosh & lamb 1991 ) @xmath68 for any model of the inner accretion disk . here",
    "@xmath69 is the mean azimuthal magnetic pitch in the annulus of radial width @xmath70 in the inner disk where the stellar field strongly interacts with gas in the disk .",
    "if the stellar magnetic field is too weak , it can not couple strongly to the gas in the accretion flow well above the stellar surface and hence can not generate magnetospheric beat - frequency oscillations .",
    "hence in the magnetospheric beat - frequency model , the coupling radius @xmath13 must be larger than the neutron star radius @xmath71 , which requires @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the maximum mass accretion rate at which the hbo is detected .",
    "in deriving inequality  ( [ mumin ] ) we have neglected the contributions of any higher multipole moments of the stellar magnetic field that may be present near the neutron star surface or may be induced by the electrical currents flowing in the disk ( see psaltis , lamb , & zylstra 1996 for a discussion ) . for the keplerian frequency at the coupling radius to exceed the neutron star spin frequency , which is also required in the magnetospheric beat - frequency model ( see ghosh & lamb 1979 ) , the magnetic dipole moment must satisfy @xmath74 where we have used the fact that @xmath75 .",
    "these upper and lower bounds on the magnetic dipole moment depend only very weakly on the neutron star mass .",

    "the width of this annulus is necessarily smaller than the width @xmath81 of the layer where the magnetic field strongly interacts with the gas in the disk , and hence @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the fwhm of the hbo .",
    "figure  4 displays this bound on @xmath70 and the constraint it imposes on the dipole moment of the stellar magnetic field .",

    "we can test this suggestion quantitatively using the data for sco  x-1 and gx  17@xmath92 , which deviate most strongly from the relation of the form  ( [ lt ] ) that fits the points with low values @xmath64  hz ..    if the hbo is caused by nodal precession and classical precession is important , then @xmath102 should decrease linearly with increasing @xmath103 ( cf .  stella & vietri 1998 ) , because relation  ( [ clasfreq ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath104 figure  7 plots @xmath102 against @xmath103 for sco  x-1 and also shows the best - fit straight line with slope @xmath105 , which has @xmath106 .",
    "the fact that the data in figure  7 can be fit satisfactorily by a straight line with slope @xmath105 is not strong evidence for this scaling , because the range of measured @xmath103 values is very narrow .",
    "however , we can use the best - fit value of the intercept of the straight line with the vertical axis to estimate the value of the parameter @xmath107 that characterizes the quadrupole moment of the gravitational field and to estimate @xmath94 .",
    "the results are @xmath108 and @xmath109 the value of @xmath94 required by equation  ( [ inum ] ) is @xmath110 time larger than the largest values given by realistic neutron - star equations of state ( see table  3 ) .",
    "the deviation of the gx  17@xmath92 data from the power - law relation  ( [ lt ] ) at high frequencies ( see fig .  6 ) requires that the classical precession frequency be negligible for @xmath64  hz but comparable to the lense - thirring precession frequency at slightly larger values of @xmath39 .",
    "this is not possible , because the exponents of @xmath39 in the lense - thirring and classical precession terms of equation  ( [ clasfreq ] ) are too similar .",
    "the data are therefore inconsistent with the predictions of the simple nodal precession model .      in the lense - thirring precession model of the hbo , the hbo frequency , the spin frequency of the neutron star , and the frequency of the upper kilohertz qpo",
    "are related by equation  ( [ lt ] ) . as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "the data are consistent with this relation when the frequency of the upper kilohertz qpo is @xmath111  hz , but the inferred value of @xmath94 is implausibly large ( see also stella & vietri 1997 , 1998 ; morsink & stella 1999 ) . aside from the rather unlikely possibility that neutron stars have ratios of @xmath94 that are four times as large as the largest values for stellar models constructed with realistic equations of state , three other possibilities",
    "have been suggested for reducing this large discrepancy .",
    "first , the frequency difference @xmath112 between the kilohertz qpos might be equal to half the neutron star spin frequency @xmath113 rather than equal to it .",
    "this is very unlikely in any beat - frequency model of the kilohertz qpos , because it would require a special direction that rotates with the neutron star but affects the inner accretion disk only once every two beat periods .",
    "however , @xmath114 appeared possible , given the initial analysis of the data taken during the type  i x - ray bursts of 4u  1636@xmath10536 ( zhang et al .",
    "1997 ; strohmayer et al . 1998 ) , which showed a strong oscillation at about 580  hz , approximately twice the frequency separation of the two kilohertz qpos .",
    "however , further analysis of this data by miller ( 1999 ) using a matched - waveform filtering technique has revealed the presence of a weak coherent oscillation at about 290  hz , approximately equal to the frequency separation of the two kilohertz qpos .",
    "thus , it now appears very unlikely that the spin frequencies of these neutron stars are twice the frequency separation of their kilohertz qpos .",
    "second , the observed hbo frequencies and their second harmonics might represent the second and fourth harmonics of the fundamental lense - thirring frequency  ( [ lt ] ) , rather than the first and second harmonics .",
    "indeed , a precessing circular orbit has a two - fold symmetry that could , in principle , produce even - order harmonics that are stronger than the odd - order harmonics .",
    "moreover , power - density spectra of the z sources show a relatively strong , broad - band noise component at frequencies comparable to the ones predicted by relation  ( [ lt ] ) .",
    "this so - called low - frequency noise ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) might inhibit detection of the fundamental of a low - frequency precession frequency ( see , e.g. , fig.6a of kuulkers et al . [",
    "1994 ] for peaked features in the low - frequency noise component of gx  5@xmath101 ) .",
    "determination of the upper limits on the amplitudes of any qpos at these frequencies would significantly constrain this possibility .",
    "note , however , that even if the hbo and its overtone are the second and fourth harmonics of the precession frequency , the @xmath94 ratios required to explain the hbo observations would still be a factor @xmath115 larger than predicted by realistic neutron - star equations of state .",
    "a further difficulty with the lense - thirring precession interpretation of the hbo is that the observed correlation between the hbo and kilohertz qpo frequencies is significantly different from what is predicted by relation  ( [ lt ] ) when the frequency of the upper kilohertz qpo is @xmath63  hz . as demonstrated in  3.1 , this difference can not be explained by classical precession ; nor can it be explained by strong - field corrections to relation  ( [ lt ] ) ( stella & vietri 1998 ) .",
    "a third possibility is that radiation forces increase the ratio of @xmath116 to @xmath39 by the factor @xmath1175 required to bring it into agreement with the observed hbo and upper khz qpo frequencies .",
    "the z sources are thought to be accreting at near - eddington mass accretion rates when the frequencies of the upper kilohertz qpos are comparable to @xmath6  khz ( see , e.g. , psaltis et al .",
    "hence radiation forces , which were neglected in equation  ( [ clasfreq ] ) , almost certainly are important . at near - critical luminosities ,",
    "both orbital and nodal precession frequencies can be altered by large factors compared to their values in the absence of radiation ; hence radiation forces might possibly explain the large discrepancy between the observed frequencies of the hbo and the frequencies predicted by the nodal precession model .",
    "an explanation in terms of the combined effects of lense - thirring precession and radiation forces would , however , require the physically implausible result that radiation forces leave the variation with @xmath51 basically unchanged while increasing the ratio of @xmath116 to @xmath39 by a factor @xmath1175 .",
    "such an explanation would also require that the qpo peaks not be significantly broadened by the radiation drag force at the same time that radiation forces are strong enough to change the orbital and precession frequencies by a factor @xmath1175 .",
    "the hbo peaks in sco  x-1 , for example , have fractional widths @xmath118 even when the inferred accretion rate is near the eddington critical rate ( van der klis et al .",
    "1997 ) . more fundamentally ,",
    "if radiation forces do change the orbital and precession frequencies of gas accreting onto the z sources by large factors , as they may well do , the observed correlation between the hbo and upper kilohertz qpo frequencies would be explained primarily by the effect of the radiation forces and not by the gravitomagnetic torque .",
    "in  2 and  3 we have studied in detail the behavior of the hbo frequencies observed in five z sources and in particular their correlation with the frequencies of the kilohertz qpos , comparing the observed behavior with the behaviors predicted by the magnetospheric beat - frequency ( alpar & shaham 1985 ; lamb et al.1985 ) and lense - thirring precession ( stella & vietri 1998 ) models of the hbo .    in  2",
    "we showed that the magnetospheric beat - frequency model is consistent with the observed correlation between the hbo and upper kilohertz qpo frequencies in the five z sources studied here if , as expected , the neutron stars in these sources are spinning near their magnetic spin equilibrium rates , the frequency separation between the upper and lower kilohertz qpos is approximately equal to the neutron - star spin frequency , the inner part of their accretion disks are optically thick and radiation - pressure - dominated , and the frequency of the upper kilohertz qpo is approximately proportional to the mass accretion rate . the model predicts a universal relation between the horizontal branch oscillation , stellar spin , and upper kilohertz qpo frequencies that agrees well with the data on five z sources .",
    "the spin rates predicted by the model are consistent with the range of the spin frequencies of the z sources inferred from the frequency separation of their kilohertz qpos if they are all accreting at similar , near - critical rates and all have @xmath119@xmath2  g dipole magnetic fields .",
    "such magnetic fields are consistent with models of z - source x - ray spectra .",
    "the inferred value of the critical fastness for the accretion rates and magnetic field strengths of the z sources is @xmath3 .",
    "if the frequency of the upper kilohertz qpo is an orbital frequency in the accretion disk , the magnetospheric beat - frequency model requires that a fraction of the accreting gas does not couple strongly to the stellar magnetic field until it has penetrated to within a few kilometers of the neutron star surface .    in  3",
    ", we showed that the trend of the correlation between the hbo frequency and the upper kilohertz qpo frequency observed at upper kilohertz qpo frequencies @xmath64  hz agrees with the trend predicted by the lense - thirring precession model .",
    "however , the observed trend is inconsistent with the model for @xmath101  hz . the observed magnitudes of the hbo frequencies are @xmath1205 times smaller than the magnitudes predicted by the lense - thirring precession model for realistic neutron - star equations of state . thus , in order to be consistent with the observed magnitudes , either @xmath94 must be @xmath1205 times larger than expected or the principal frequency of the x - ray oscillation generated by nodal precession must be @xmath1205 times the nodal precession frequency .",

    "the hbo and kilohertz qpos were simultaneously detected mostly when they were on their horizontal branches .",
    "the transition from the horizontal to the normal branch is thought to take place when the mass accretion rate increases to within a few percent of the eddington critical rate ( see lamb 1989 ; psaltis et al .",
    "if so , the resulting change in the accretion flow pattern ( see lamb 1989 ) might be responsible for the different dependences of the hbo frequency @xmath127 and the instantaneous frequency separation @xmath128 of the two kilohertz qpos on the upper kilohertz qpo frequency @xmath39 in sco  x-1 , compared to the dependences in the other four z sources in our sample .",

    "the result is shown in figure  11 . in this plot",
    "we have included only points derived from simultaneous observations of the hbo and kilohertz qpo frequencies .",
    "the larger scatter of the points in figure  11 at @xmath64  hz compared to the scatter of the points in figure  7 corresponding to the same values of @xmath11 and @xmath39 is caused by the large uncertainties in @xmath128 .",

    "in fact , @xmath133 is consistent with all the data .",
    "the sco  x-1 and gx  17@xmath92 data have relatively small uncertainties and give best - fit coefficients @xmath134 that are slightly but significantly different . the uncertainties in the data on gx  5@xmath101 and gx  340@xmath90 are sufficiently large that their contours allow values of @xmath134 that are consistent with either the sco  x-1 or the gx  17@xmath92 value .    the surprising correlation between the hbo frequency , the frequency of the upper kilohertz qpo , and the _ instantaneous _ frequency separation of the kilohertz qpos shown in figure  11 may be coincidental .",
