    "in this contribution we start by considering the domino tilings of the aztec diamond , probably the most well - known and studied random tiling model , and we explain in quite some details how this model is equivalent to an interacting particle system .",
    "after that two generalizations are presented .",
    "the connection between the aztec diamond and a @xmath1-dimensional interacting particle system is well - known since the work of jockusch , propp and shor  @xcite , where they used it to prove the _ arctic circle theorem_. indeed , one quarter of the arctic circle is nothing else than the hydrodynamic limit of the height function associated with a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process in discrete time with parallel update and packed initial condition .    in  @xcite we constructed a class of @xmath2-dimensional interacting particle systems , some of which have the property that their fixed time projections can be viewed as a random tiling model , while certain @xmath1-dimensional projections represent models in the kardar - parisi - zhang universality class of stochastic growth models ( like totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes ) .",
    "the domino tilings of the aztec diamond is a special case that fits in that framework as remarked at the end of section 2.6 of  @xcite .",
    "this was not a complete surprise , as the connection between the shuffling algorithm of the aztec diamond and an interacting particle system in @xmath0 dimensions was previously obtained by nordenstam  @xcite ( this was later extended to a few other cases in  @xcite ) .",
    "the particle configurations in the state space of the ( discrete time ) markov chain in  @xcite are not in a one - to - one mapping to domino tilings of the aztec diamond , rather in a one - to - many relation . here _ many _ is not an arbitrary quantity , but it is the number of random fillings in the shuffling algorithm during the last iteration .",
    "the mapping is the same as the mapping between tilings of the aztec diamond and the six - vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions at the free - fermion point  @xcite . in order to have a bijection one needs to have the information of the particle configurations at the two latest time moments ( this fact is used for instance in the java applet  @xcite ) .",
    "the reason for this fact will be clear when discussing the parallel update in the markov chain , see section  [ sectakpz ] .    to explain the relation between the aztec diamond and our interacting particle system , we map both systems to a set of non - intersecting ( broken ) lines viewed as paths on a lindstrm - gessel - viennot ( lgv ) planar directed graph .",
    "they were first introduced by johansson in  @xcite in the study of the airy@xmath3 fluctuations of the border of the disordered phase .",
    "the previously studied line ensembles representations as in  @xcite are still one - to - many , while the one used in  @xcite is in bijection with the tiling configurations .",
    "this bijection results in the shuffling algorithm  @xcite inducing a markovian dynamics on the ensembles of lines .",
    "the same line ensembles with the same dynamics can be also obtained from the configurations of a system of interacting particles in in discrete time with parallel update  @xcite and with a particular initial condition .    the probability measures ( on tilings , sets of particles , or line ensembles ) one obtains in this way",
    "fall into the class of so - called conditional @xmath4-ensembles and thus have determinantal correlation functions  @xcite .",
    "these measures and the corresponding markov dynamics can also be described in terms of dimer models on rail yard graphs  @xcite .",
    "the constructions of the present paper can be recast into the framework of the schur processes ( introduced in  @xcite ) and schur dynamics on them ( introduced in  @xcite ) . while we wo nt do that here ( see , however , a recent exposition in  @xcite ) ,",
    "let us make the connection more explicit .",
    "the basic fact is that the weights that we associate to the two sections of our lgv graphs    [ r]@xmath5 [ r]@xmath6 [ r]@xmath7 [ c]@xmath8 [ c]@xmath9 [ c]@xmath10 [ l]@xmath11 [ l]@xmath12 [ l]@xmath13 , the weight of the right one is @xmath14.,title=\"fig:\",height=151 ]    with weights of vertical edges in the first graph being @xmath15 and weights of skew edges in the second graph being @xmath16 ( all other edges have weight 1 ) , can be viewed as values of the skew schur functions @xmath17 and @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 stands for the specialization of the symmetric functions into a single non - zero variable equal to @xmath15 ( with complete homogeneous symmetric functions specializing into @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) , and @xmath20 stands for the specialization into a single dual variable equal to @xmath16 ( with complete homogeneous symmetric functions specializing into @xmath21 if @xmath22 , @xmath23 if @xmath24 , and @xmath25 if @xmath26 ) .",
    "the commutativity relations of type ( [ eqintertwining ] ) below then turn into instances of the skew - cauchy identity ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we chose to use more general notation in this paper ( and in  @xcite ) because of a potential applicability of the general setup to other models , which was indeed realized for example in  @xcite .",
    "most of the work reported in this note was done in 2010 , but it seems to not have lost all of its novelty yet . indeed very recently we have been asked about the details of the connection between our work  @xcite and random tiling models .",
    "thus we decided to make them available with this publication .",
    "in section  [ sectaztec ] we define the aztec diamond , its domino tilings , and introduce the mapping to non - intersecting line ensembles . in section  [ sectakpz ]",
    "we present a class of markov dynamics on interlacing particle systems and explain which initial conditions and parameters one has to choose to generate the same measure as the non - intersecting line ensembles of the aztec diamond",
    ". finally , in section  [ sectgeneralization ] we present two generalizations of the particle dynamics and explain which random tilings they correspond to .",

    "in this section we introduce the aztec diamond , a well - known random model , and explain his representation as a system of non - intersecting lines .",
    "the latter will be used later to make the connection with a markov chain dynamics on interlacing particle configurations .",
    "domino tilings of the aztec diamond were introduced in  @xcite . for any , we define the aztec diamond @xmath27 of size @xmath28 as the union of all lattice squares @xmath29\\times[n , n+1]$ ] , @xmath30 , such that they are inside the region .",

    "the colors represents the four types of dominoes.,height=170 ]      to generate a random tiling of the aztec diamond of size @xmath28 , one can proceed iteratively from the aztec diamond of size @xmath41 by means of the _ shuffling algorithm _ introduced in  @xcite , that we recall briefly . for that purpose ,",
    "let us give some names to the different types of dominoes : by superimposing the aztec diamond to a checkerboard table ( which of the chosen two possible ways is irrelevant ) , there are actually four types of dominoes , as the black site might be either to the right / left ( resp .",
    "top / bottom ) site of a horizontal ( resp .",
    "vertical ) domino .",
    "we call them north , east , south , and west dominoes according to the following rule : the north ( resp . south ) domino is the horizontal one that fits into the top ( resp .",
    "bottom ) most part of the aztec diamond , and similarly the east ( resp .",
    "west ) domino is the vertical one that fits into the right ( resp",
    ". left ) most part of the aztec diamond .",
    "the shuffling algorithm is the following .",
    "start with a domino tiling of @xmath27 distributed according to @xmath35 :    * move all the dominoes in the direction of their names by one unit .",
    "if in doing it a north and a south domino ( resp .",
    "a east and a west domino ) exchange their positions , remove them .",
    "* at this point , the dominoes partially tile @xmath42 .",
    "the empty region can be uniquely decomposed into @xmath43 blocs . independently of each other",
    ", each bloc is tiled with two horizontal dominoes with probability @xmath44 or two vertical dominoes with probability @xmath45 .",
    "this procedure generates a random tiling of the aztec diamond @xmath42 with distribution @xmath46 as proven in  @xcite .      to each tiling of the aztec diamond one",
    "can associate a set of non - intersecting lines bijectively as shown by johansson in  @xcite .",
    "we use a slightly different but equivalent representation . add horizontal lines in the middle of the south - type dominoes , a 45-degrees oriented segment in the west - type dominoes and a step - down in the east - type dominoes as indicated in figure  [ figaztec3 ] . for a tiling of @xmath27",
    "this results in @xmath28 non - intersecting lines with fixed initial and end points .     and its associates set of lines .",
    "the north dominoes are red , the south are yellow , the east are green , and finally the west dominoes are blue.,height=207 ]    further , one can think of the aztec diamond of size @xmath28 as being embedded into tilings of @xmath47 , where outside the aztec diamond we add only horizontal dominoes that do not overlap and fill the whole space , see the gray tiles in figure  [ figaztec4 ] ( left ) .    .",
    "left panel : the original tiling of figure  [ figaztec3 ] with the lines extended deterministically outside @xmath27 .",
    "right pane : final representation of the ensemble of non - intersecting lines .",
    "the dotted lines is the underlying lgv graph .",
    "the lines which are fixed and correspond to the gray dominoes of the left picture are dashed.,height=188 ]    by a simple geometric transformation , which can be easily recovered by comparing the left and the right illustrations in figure  [ figaztec4 ] , we obtain the final non - intersecting line ensemble representation of the random tiling of figure  [ figaztec3 ] .    the above procedure gives a bijection between a tiling of an aztec diamond and a configuration of non - intersecting lines on a lindstrm - gessel - viennot ( lgv ) directed graph .",
    "the basic building bloc of the lgv graph is the one here on the right .",
    "then , if we consider an aztec diamond of size @xmath28 , we have a one - to - one bijection between the set of non - intersecting lines on the lgv graph that consists of @xmath28 copies of the basic building bloc and where the lines start and end at all vertical positions @xmath48 , see figure  [ figaztec4 ] for an example .",
    "now we have a bijection between a set of non - intersecting line ensembles and the set of all possible tilings of the aztec diamond @xmath27 .",
    "the next question is to know which weights we have to assign to the edges of the lgv graph in order to obtain the distribution on @xmath27 given by ( [ eqmeasaztec ] ) , i.e. , where each vertical domino has weight @xmath49 and each horizontal domino has weight @xmath50 .",
    "it is easy to see that it is enough to give weight @xmath50 to each horizontal edge of the lgv graph and weight @xmath49 to each of the vertical edges and the down - right edges . alternatively , since the number of east and west dominoes are equal , we can also give weight @xmath50 to each horizontal edge , weight @xmath15 to each vertical edge and @xmath16 to each down - right edge , provided that @xmath51 .",
    "because of the bijection described above , the shuffling algorithm induces a markov dynamics on the set of non - intersecting line ensembles . to see how the dynamics works",
