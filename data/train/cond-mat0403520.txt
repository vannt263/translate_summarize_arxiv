    "recently the quasi - one - dimensional spin ladder has attracted much interest both experimentally and theoretically@xcite .",
    "more and more ladder - structure compounds have been realized , such as srcu@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite , cu@xmath0(c@xmath2h@xmath3n@xmath0)@xmath0cl@xmath4@xcite , ( 5iap)@xmath0cubr@xmath52h@xmath0o@xcite , ( c@xmath2h@xmath3n)@xmath0cubr@xmath4@xcite , and so forth .",
    "although many ladder compounds can be well described by simple isotropic ladders , the structural distortion and the spin - orbital interaction of the transition ions can lead to various magnetic anisotropies .",
    "besides the spin - orbital interaction , both on - site coulomb exchange interaction@xcite and nonlocal coulomb interaction@xcite also influence the anisotropy .",
    "anisotropic interaction from bond buckling has been recently found in copper - oxide ladder compounds cacu@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite due to an angle deviation from 180@xmath6 in the cu - o - cu bond@xcite .",
    "an anisotropic rung interaction was considered in ref.@xcite motivated by cacu@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite and a two - leg spin ladder with an xxz - rung interaction was derived in the presence of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction and the kaplan - shekhtman - entin - wohlman - aharony interactions .",
    "when the cu - o - cu bond is near 90@xmath6 , the rung interaction is weak in the copper - oxide ladder .",
    "spin anisotropy in the exchange interaction also exists in strongly - coupled ladder compounds such as ( pipdh)@xmath0cubr@xmath4@xcite . on the other hand , real spin ladder compounds",
    "are usually described by the standard heisenberg ladder model , which is not exactly soluble , turning the computation of the physical properties for the ground state ( gs ) , the gap , the thermodynamical quantities and other relevant properties in the presence of temperature and magnetic fields , rather difficult .",
    "usually , just numerical calculations and perturbative schemes can be applied .",
    "recently it was shown that the integrable spin ladder model@xcite can describe the properties of strongly - coupled spin ladder compounds when a rescaling parameter is introduced@xcite .",
    "therefore , it can be expected that integrable ladders with anisotropic rung interactions can provide some meaningful information in the physics of anisotropies .",
    "in addition , anisotropic rung interactions also provide us with some more adjustable parameters that may be useful in fitting the experimental data of compounds .    in the present paper",
    "we shall consider the anisotropy in the rung interaction and the corresponding magnetic anisotropic effect by solving an integrable spin ladder with a general xyz rung interaction . by means of the thermodynamical bethe ansatz ( tba ) and the high temperature expansion ( hte)@xcite",
    ", we investigate the influence of the anisotropic rung interaction on the quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) and the magnetic properties .",
    "the contents are arranged as follows : ( i ) in the second section we present the model and the exact rung - state basis in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "then the model is solved by the bethe ansatz ( ba ) approach .",
    "( ii ) the third section gives the tba equations for the gs and the hte for physical properties at finite temperatures .",
    "( iii ) in the forth section , we study the field - induced qpt s .",
    "the rung anisotropy provides two kinds of gapped ladders , respectively with one and two components in the gs .",
    "the analytic expressions are obtained for all the critical fields of the corresponding qpt s .",
    "the rung anisotropy also leads to a separation of the magnetizations and susceptibilities in different directions .",
    "the magnetization inflection point ( ip ) may be lowered from the half - saturation and in the two - component gapped ladder the ip is even not invariant under different temperatures .",
    "a remnant variation of magnetization can be found after the last qpt . in the fifth section",
    "we give a summary of our results .",
    "we shall consider a spin-1/2 two - leg spin ladder model with a general xyz - type anisotropy in the rung interaction , whose hamiltonian reads @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the spin operators for the two legs and @xmath10 is the land @xmath10 factor in the direction of the field .",
    "@xmath11 is the average of the leg interaction and @xmath12 is a rescaling parameter .",
    "the value @xmath13 was introduced in refs.@xcite in fitting with isotropic ladder compounds in the presence of weak rung .",
    "the bulk part @xmath14 with the permutation operator @xmath15 exhibits the su(4 ) symmetry@xcite .",
    "isotropic integrable spin ladder@xcite has identical @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "when the rung interaction is strong , it is favorable for the spin ladder system to form rung states , since the leg interaction is too weak to take apart the rung state .",
    "anisotropy in the rung interaction leads to the collapse of the conventional singlet and triplet rung states from the isotropic ladder , even in the absence of the field .",
    "however , we find a new exact basis valid both in the absence and presence of an external magnetic field , @xmath19 where @xmath20 then the corresponding rung energies include the zeeman energy in a nonlinear way , @xmath21    the rung states \\{@xmath22 } provides a new fundamental representation of the su(4 ) lie algebra @xmath23 with commutation relations of the generators @xmath24=\\delta _ { n , k}s_m^l-\\delta _ { m , l}s_k^n$ ] . based on this su(4 ) realization and the vanishing commutation relations @xmath25=[{\\cal m},{\\cal h}_0]=0 $ ] , one can solve the model ( [ h ] ) via the ba approach@xcite .",
    "the ba equations are the same as those obtained for the su(4 ) model@xcite and for the su(3)@xmath26u(1 ) spin ladder@xcite . here",
    "we present the ba equations together with the eigenenergy @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "there are @xmath32 rungs , @xmath33 is the total number of rung state @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the rapidity .",
    "@xmath36 is the total rapidity number in the @xmath37th branch .    from the ba equations and the eigenenergy we can apply the tba and hte to study the collective properties of the model .",
    "when the field is applied in the @xmath38 or @xmath39 direction , one only needs to permute the anisotropy parameter values @xmath40 as well as the corresponding @xmath10 factors .",
    "we incorporate @xmath10 into the field unit in plotting figures to investigate the net effect of the anisotropic rung interaction . for a powder sample ,",
    "a simple way is to take an average of the three directions .",
    "by adopting the string conjectures@xcite and applying the yang - yang method@xcite at the thermodynamic limit , one can obtain the gs equations for three dressed energies @xmath41 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 and the symbol @xmath44 denotes the convolution .",
    "the basis order is chosen as ( @xmath45)@xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is energetically the most favorable state while @xmath49 is the least favorable one .",
    "for the chosen order the driving term is given by @xmath50 .",
    "the gs is composed of fermi seas filled by negative @xmath51 .",
    "if some branch of the dressed energy is all positive , then the corresponding excitations to this branch is gapful .",
    "a qpt occurs at the point where the gap is closed .",
    "we shall apply these tba equations to analyze the field - induced qtp for the gs .    for the finite temperature case the tba involves an infinite number of coupled integral equations .",
    "in the present paper we shall apply the hte@xcite from t - system@xcite within the quantum transfer matrix formalism@xcite , which involves only a finite number of integral equations and consequently is more convenient .",
    "following refs.@xcite , one can obtain the free energy @xmath52 for per rung in high temperatures . here",
    "we present the first four terms which dominate the physics for high temperatures : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the temperature , the coefficients are @xmath55 with the definitions @xmath56 @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "one can get higher orders for lower temperatures .",
    "the magnetization and the susceptibility can be easily obtained by @xmath60 .",
    "the rescaling parameter @xmath13 in the isotropic case@xcite gives the leading term of the gap for the integrable ladder in fitting with the experimental ladder compounds .",
    "if the rung @xmath11 is weak , then the hte gives a valid result even for low temperatures due to the large rescaling @xmath12 .",
    "for different anisotropies there are two different gapped ladders . in one case , only one component @xmath61 exists in the gapped gs when @xmath62 . in the other case both @xmath61 and @xmath63",
    "are involved in the gapped gs .",
    "first we discuss the former case which happens more likely .",
    "it requires @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "condition ( [ gapped1 ] ) expels the components @xmath66 and @xmath67 from the gs , while condition ( [ gapped2 ] ) excludes the component @xmath68 .",
    "the field will bring @xmath66 down to the ground state and close the gap @xmath69 at a critical field @xmath70 , which leads to the first quantum phase transition ( qpt ) .",
    "further increase of the field will bring all components of @xmath61 out of the gs and another gap @xmath71 opens at the critical field @xmath72 , which characterizes another qpt .",
    "the factor @xmath73 in the gap comes from the maximum depth of the first dressed energy branch .",
    "it is easy to see that only the components @xmath61 and @xmath66 compete in the gs involving one branch of dressed energy , since the gs only consists of @xmath61 in the absence of the field while only @xmath66 is lowered in energy level when the field is applied .",
    "the analytic expressions of two critical fields can be obtained exactly as @xmath74 setting @xmath75 recovers the result for isotropic case@xcite , as expected .",
    "a weak anisotropy will lead to different critical fields and consequently separate the magnetizations in different directions .",
    "we give an example of the magnetization with weak anisotropy in fig.[mz8910 ] , a low - temperature magnetization was presented for comparison in the @xmath76 direction .",
    "the corresponding low - temperature magnetizations for all three directions are presented in fig.[mzt8910 ] , obtained from the hte .",
    "magnetizations in different directions for strong anisotropy are demonstrated as an example in fig.[mz3615 ] for the gs and in fig.[mzt13615 ] for a low temperature .",
    "before the gap is closed at @xmath70 , the gap @xmath77 near @xmath70 can be expanded to a simpler form @xmath78 @xmath79 .",
    "considerable excitations can be stimulated by the temperature @xmath54 if @xmath54 is in the order of the gap @xmath80 , the magnetization will rise from zero before the field reaches the critical point .",
    "an expansion based on small fermi points@xcite gives the zero - temperature critical behavior in the vicinity of @xmath70 @xmath81 here @xmath82 is the magnetization of a single rung state @xmath66 , it also varies with the field due to the anisotropic rung interaction , as we will discuss below in ( [ mz3 ] ) . for the lowest order in the critical behavior",
    ", @xmath82 takes the value at the critical point @xmath70 .",
    "this @xmath83 critical behavior , typical for gapped integer spin antiferromagnetic chains@xcite , is buried by the afore - mentioned temperature effect .",
    "this temperature effect can be seen in fig.[mzt3615 ] , in which the magnetization of the @xmath76 direction at @xmath84 becomes considerable at the field @xmath85 .",
    "actually the magnetization at @xmath84 increases nearly in a linear way before the @xmath86 .",
    "a special point in the magnetization is the inflection point ( ip ) @xmath87 , which is an invariant point under low temperatures , @xmath88 where the two components @xmath61 and @xmath66 have the same rung energies @xmath89 and the same proportion @xmath90 in the gs .",
    "the excitations to @xmath68 and @xmath67 are gapful , the gap can be obtained exactly from ( [ tba ] ) @xmath91 at low temperatures , the excitations to @xmath68 or @xmath67 are difficult to stimulate , while the temperature does not influence the relative proportion between @xmath61 and @xmath66 due to their same energies at the ip .",
    "consequently the proportions of @xmath61 and @xmath66 remain almost unchanged when the temperature varies .",
    "therefore the magnetization at @xmath87 also remains unmoved when the temperatures changes , and the magnetization curves of various temperatures cross each other at the same point @xmath92 , which is shown by the curves for temperatures @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath11 in fig.[mzt3615 ] .",
    "this requires low temperatures @xmath96 as well as the gapped ladder conditions ( [ gapped1 ] ) and ( [ gapped2 ] ) , @xmath97 is the excitation gap to @xmath68 or @xmath67 in ( [ gapip ] ) .",
    "when the temperature is sufficiently high such that the excitations to @xmath68 or @xmath67 are considerable , the involvement of these components reduces the proportion of @xmath66 which has the highest magnetization .",
    "the components @xmath68 and @xmath67 have zero and negative magnetizations , respectively . as a result ,",
    "the magnetization at @xmath87 deviates from @xmath92 and move downwards .",
    "we show this moving by magnetization curves at temperatures @xmath98 , @xmath99 in fig.[mzt3615 ] , for which one can find observation examples in cu@xmath0(c@xmath2h@xmath3n@xmath0)@xmath0cl@xmath4@xcite .",
    "the magnetization at the ip can be worked out as @xmath100 where @xmath101 . for the isotropic ladder , @xmath102 and",
    "consequently @xmath103 is located at the half of the saturation magnetization @xmath104@xcite .",
    "the anisotropy lowers the magnetization of the ip due to @xmath105 , i.e. @xmath106 .",
    "physically , the anisotropy in @xmath38,@xmath39 directions hybridizes the elemental state @xmath107 into @xmath66 so that @xmath66 is not a pure fully - polarized elemental state @xmath108 as in the isotropic case . for xxz - type rung interaction @xmath103",
    "is half - saturation when the field is oriented in @xmath76 direction , but also lowered when the field is applied in other directions .",
    "this ip lowering effect is more obvious for the strong anisotropic case , we give an example in fig.[mz3615 ] .",
    "as one can see from this figure , besides the strong separation of the magnetization in different directions , the ip points in @xmath38 and @xmath76 directions move below the half saturation point .",
    "in addition to the separation of the magnetization in different directions and the lowering of the inflection points , another property in the anisotropic case is the remnant variation of the magnetization after the second phase transition .",
    "the fact that magnetization increases between @xmath70 and @xmath72 mainly comes from the proportional competition between the two state @xmath61 and @xmath66 , i.e. , more rungs are occupied by @xmath66 when the field gets higher .",
    "the single - rung magnetization in state @xmath66 can be obtained explicitly @xmath109 where @xmath110 increases with the field from the expression ( [ eta ] ) .",
    "the long - dashed line in fig.[mz3615 ] gives an example of @xmath111 in @xmath76 direction , which increases from zero from the beginning of the application of the magnetic field .",
    "if @xmath70 is small , then the increment of @xmath82 also contributes with an important part to the growth of the magnetization .",
    "otherwise for higher @xmath70 , the change of @xmath82 contributes less to the growth of the total magnetization , since @xmath111 has slowed down in increasing before the first quantum phase transition occurs .",
    "however , the competition between @xmath61 and @xmath66 comes to end after the second phase transition and the magnetization is completely @xmath82 .",
    "this gives a remnant variation of magnetization even after the second phase transition , since @xmath82 is still approaching to the saturation limit .",
    "this remnant variation of magnetization is illustrated for the ground state in fig.[mz3615 ] and can also be seen for the temperature case ( fig.[mzt13615 ] ) .",
    "examples of the magnetic susceptibility in the three directions are plotted in fig.[sus8910 ] for weakly anisotropic rung and in fig.[sus3615 ] for strongly anisotropic rung .",
    "weak anisotropy separates the heights of the magnetic susceptibility peak , while a strong anisotropy also leads to an obvious separation of the whole susceptibility including the peak positions .",
    "anisotropy in the rung interaction also provides another possibility of a gapped ladder , in which not only the rung state @xmath61 but also @xmath68 are involved in the gs before the field is applied and brings about the first qpt .",
    "the single - state energy difference is @xmath112 .",
    "the larger is the difference , the more strongly @xmath61 and @xmath68 will expel each other in the fermi sea .",
    "the two - component gapped ladder requires @xmath113 so that @xmath61 and @xmath68 are close enough in the energy levels to exist in the gs at the same time in the absence of the field .",
    "also a strong @xmath18 is needed to expel @xmath66 and @xmath67 from the gapped gs before the field is applied , approximately @xmath114 for simplicity , we assume @xmath115 so that @xmath61 has lower energy than @xmath68 , one only needs to change @xmath116 to be @xmath117 for lower @xmath68 .",
    "the first qpt occurs when the field brings down @xmath118 and gets involved in the gs , the critical field can be obtained with the help of the wiener - hopf technique@xcite which is valid for large fermi points ( fermi surface in one dimension ) .",
    "explicitly we have @xmath119 ^ 2-\\frac{(j_x - j_y)^2}{16 } } ,   \\label{hc1gs2}\\ ] ] which gives a good approximation if the value of @xmath116 is not very close to @xmath120 .",
    "further increase will lower the energy of @xmath118 below @xmath61 and @xmath68 and bring them out of the gs one by one .",
    "the component variations in the qpt are @xmath121 , where each arrow indicates the occurrence of a qpt .",
    "since @xmath68 has also zero magnetization , the total magnetization also remains null in the gapped phase before the first qpt .",
    "the zero - magnetization component @xmath68 gets out of the gs after @xmath87 if @xmath122 while for @xmath123 @xmath68 is brought off the gs before @xmath87 .",
    "these happen at the second qpt with an approximate critical field @xmath124",
    "^ 2-\\frac{j_{x - y}^2}{16 } } ,   \\label{hc2gs2}\\ ] ] where @xmath125 .",
    "the expression ( [ hc2gs2 ] ) can give a satisfactory approximation when the value of @xmath126 is not near @xmath73 .",
    "the exact critical field @xmath127 for the third qpt is the same as @xmath72 in ( [ hc2 ] ) .",
    "when the example in fig.([qip ] ) has numerical points @xmath128 and @xmath129 , the expressions ( [ hc1gs2 ] ) and ( [ hc2gs2 ] ) provide analytic results @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "the ip in the one - component gapped ladder case will not be invariant in the two - component ladder case .",
    "if the component @xmath68 gets out of the gs after @xmath87 , the @xmath68 is gapless .",
    "although the components @xmath61 and @xmath66 still have the same proportion at the ip , any small temperature will excite more components of @xmath68 and consequently decreases the proportion of @xmath61 and @xmath66 .",
    "therefore the temperature will lower the total magnetization from that of the gs .",
    "if the component @xmath68 gets out of the gs before @xmath87 , with the condition ( [ c2<ip ] ) , the ip is hardly an invariant . despite of the existence of a gap for excitations to @xmath68 at @xmath87",
    ", the gap is actually quite small @xmath132 relative to the strong rung interaction .",
    "so a low temperature of order @xmath11 will still stimulate considerable excitations to @xmath68 and lower the magnetization at @xmath87 .",
    "we illustrate this by an example in fig.([qip ] ) .",
    "we have introduced a two - leg spin-1/2 ladder with a general anisotropic xyz rung interaction . in particular , the exact rung state basis for this model was found .",
    "we have studied the effect of the anisotropic rung interaction by solving the integrable ladder in the context of the thermodynamical bethe ansatz and the high - temperature expansion .",
    "two kinds of gapped ladders were provided , respectively involving one and two components in the gs in the absence of the magnetic field .",
    "we have obtained analytically all the corresponding critical fields for the field - induced quantum phase transitions .",
    "the magnetizations and susceptibilities in different directions separates under the rung anisotropy .",
    "the magnetization inflection point is lowered from the half - saturation and a weak changing in magnetization still remains after the last quantum phase transition .",
    "the inflection point in the two - component gapped ladder case is not invariant as in the one - component gapped ladder case due to field - deduced three - component competition or small excitation gap .",
