    "were mentioned we would like to point out first that the results of @xcite published in 1997 already contain a lower bound for the relational distance by using the notion of @xmath2vector , as explained in the following section . in particular it was also shown that the given lower bound is sharp if and only if the poset is of order dimension at most two .    in the present paper",
