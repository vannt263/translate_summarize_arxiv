    "in the last decades , one of the most striking developments in particle physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) is the experimental establishment  @xcite of neutrino masses and the large mixing property , which is quite different from the small mixing in the quark sector .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments have revealed neutrino mass - squared differences and its flavor mixing angles .",
    "notably , a simple form of mixing matrix , referred to as tri - bimaximal mixing , is well descriptive of the observed mixing structure  @xcite .",
    "vast numbers of flavor models have been proposed in order to derive the tri - bimaximal mixing  @xcite ; thus , from a theoretical viewpoint , it is one of the most important subjects to realize difference between tri - bimaximal and observed mixing angles .",
    "in addition , recent results of the three - flavor global data analysis  @xcite indicate non - zero @xmath5 ; as the best - fit value , not so small one @xmath6 is obtained .",
    "therefore , it seems interesting to examine deviations of neutrino mixing angles from the tri - bimaximal pattern  @xcite , which leads to @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , for the coming future precise experiments .",
    "the present knowledge of neutrino parameters ( i.e. masses , mixing angles and phases ) is not only important for low - energy characters of neutrinos , but also a key ingredient of the origin of flavor structure in the sm fermions .",
    "it is thus meaningful to make clear the relation between neutrino parameters and high - energy phenomenologies . among them , charged lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) process would give an intriguing clue , since supersymmetry ( susy ) and the seesaw mechanism  @xcite could enhance lfv as reachable in near future experiments  @xcite .",
    "the seesaw mechanism naturally provides desired neutrino mass scale , and predicted lfv fractions are affected by low - energy neutrino parameters and heavy majorana masses via susy breaking terms  @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we examine the relation between neutrino parameters and lfv prediction , in light of the tri - bimaximal mixing and the recent precision oscillation data .",
    "we use a particular parametrization  @xcite of the mns matrix  @xcite , where the tri - bimaximal mixing is taken as its zeroth order approximation , and give a detailed analysis of lfv prediction especially for a simple case of right - handed majorana mass and susy breaking structures .",
    "our study shows that upcoming experimental lfv searches provide useful implications for neutrino mass spectrum and mixing angles .",
    "if we possess simple structure of heavy majorana masses , future discovery of @xmath0 implies that inverted hierarchy ( ih ) and quasi - degenerate ( qd ) neutrino mass spectra are inconsistent with a large reactor angle of order 0.1 , though normal hierarchy ( nh ) is still allowed .",

    "lfv ] and  [ sec : lfv - tb ] , relation between neutrino parameters and lfv prediction in a literature of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with the seesaw mechanism is studied .",

    "@xmath18 stands for the diagonal phase matrix which involves two majorana phases .",

    "the flavor structure could be determined by profound principles such as flavor symmetry in a high - energy regime .",
