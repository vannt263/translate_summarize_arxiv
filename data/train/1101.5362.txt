    "the low - energy sector of qcd has been successfully described over recent years within the chiral lagrangian framework .",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) is based on the spontaneously breaking of chiral symmetry @xmath12 with @xmath13 light flavors and provides a consistent , systematic and model - independent scheme to calculate low - energy observables @xcite .",
    "the effective chpt lagrangian is constructed as an expansion of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes a meson energy scale compared to the chiral scale @xmath16 1 gev . for @xmath17 case ,",
    "the vector group symmetry is broken by the strange - light quark mass difference @xmath18 , although @xmath19 can still be considered as a perturbation compared to @xmath20 , leading to @xmath4 chpt , which reduces formally to @xmath3 in the @xmath21 limit @xcite .",
    "the formalism can also be extended to finite temperature @xmath0 , in order to describe meson gases and their evolution towards chiral symmetry restoration for @xmath0 below the critical temperature @xmath22 @xcite , where @xmath23 180 - 200 mev from lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "the use of chpt in this context is important in order to provide model - independent results for the evolution of the different observables with @xmath0 , supporting the original predictions for chiral restoration @xcite , also confirmed by lattice simulations , which are consistent with a crossover - like transition for @xmath17 ( 2 + 1 flavors in the physical case ) , which becomes of second order for @xmath24 , in the @xmath25 universality class , and first order in the degenerate case of three equal flavors .",
    "the @xmath26 vector group is the isospin symmetry , which is a very good approximation to nature .",
    "however , there are several examples where isospin breaking corrections are phenomenologically relevant , such as sum rules for quark condensates @xcite , meson masses @xcite or pion scattering @xcite .",
    "for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "the two possible sources of isospin breaking are the qcd @xmath27 light quark mass difference and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "both can be accommodated within the chpt framework .",
    "the expected corrections from the first source are of order @xmath28 and are encoded in the quark mass matrix , generating also a @xmath11 mixing term in the @xmath4 lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic interactions are included in the chpt effective lagrangian via the external source method and give rise to new terms @xcite of order @xmath29 , @xmath30 and so on , with @xmath31 the electric charge .",
    "these terms are easily incorporated in the chpt power counting scheme by considering formally @xmath32 , with @xmath33 the pion decay constant in the chiral limit .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study within chpt isospin breaking effects related to the thermodynamics of the meson gas .",
    "we will be particularly interested in the physical quantities directly related to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and its restoration , namely , the quark condensates and their corresponding susceptibilities at finite temperature .",
    "the quark condensate is the order parameter of chiral restoration , but since the transition is a smooth crossover for the physical case , different observables can yield different transition temperatures .",
    "thus , the susceptibilities , defined as derivatives of the condensates with respect to the quark masses , provide also direct information about the transition and its nature , since they tend to peak around the transition point reflecting the growth of correlations .",
    "let us mention some of the motivations we have in mind for the present analysis .",
    "for the physical values of quark and meson masses , we are interested in the effect of the isospin - breaking terms in the light quark condensate @xmath34 and therefore on the chpt estimates of the critical temperature . in addition , in the isospin asymmetric case , one has @xmath35 and in fact @xmath6 can be considered an order parameter for isospin breaking .",
    "actually , isospin is not spontaneously broken in qcd @xcite which means that this order parameter should vanish for @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "this is an important difference with the scalar condensate @xmath34 , which is nonzero in the chiral limit .",
    "it is relevant to estimate the thermal evolution of @xmath6 , since in principle the two condensates melt at different critical temperatures .",
    "a further motivation is the analysis of the three independent susceptibilities , directly related to the isosinglet , connected ( isotriplet ) and disconnected susceptibilities @xcite often discussed in lattice analysis @xcite .",
    "including properly the @xmath38 dependence of condensates is then essential to analyze the temperature and mass evolution of the connected and disconnected pieces measured in the lattice .",
    "in particular , the linear @xmath27 corrections to condensates survive the @xmath36 limit in the susceptibilities .",
    "the contributions coming from @xmath11 mixing in the @xmath4 case belong to this type and are particularly important regarding the temperature dependence .",
    "this is not only interesting for physical masses but also to explore the scaling near the chiral limit , which in lattice studies has been used to investigate the nature of the transition @xcite . in the lattice",
    "works , this scaling may be contaminated by lattice artifacts such as taste breaking in the staggered fermion formalism , which can generate contributions to susceptibilities masking the true scaling behaviour @xcite .",
    "our study provides then a model - independent setup for disentangling these effects and establishes the expected results in the continuum limit .",
    "we will work in chpt to one loop , considering on the same footing the two sources of isospin - breaking . in a previous work @xcite",
    "we have studied the quark condensates at @xmath39 and several related phenomenological aspects of the isospin asymmetric case .",
    "we will refer to that work for more details about the formalism , the numerical values of the low - energy constants and other related issues .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : form ] we will review the main aspects of the isospin - breaking chpt formalism related to the present work .",
    "our results for the quark condensates at finite @xmath0 both in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 cases are given and analyzed in section [ sec : cond ] .",
    "in that section we explore the temperature dependence of isospin breaking , as well as that of the sum rule relating condensate ratios .",
    "section [ sec : susc ] is devoted to the analysis of the different isospin - breaking scalar susceptibilities and their relation to the connected and disconnected ones . in subsection",
    "[ sec : sumrule ] we provide an interesting sum rule relating the electromagnetic differences in the condensates with the total susceptibility .",
    "we explore the possibility of using that sum rule to estimate the errors in the staggered fermion lattice analysis of the condensates , in connection with the taste breaking effect . in subsection",
    "[ sec : sustempmass ] we make a thorough study of the connected and disconnected contributions to the susceptibility and their dependence with temperature , the quark mass and the isospin ratio @xmath40 .",
    "we pay special attention to the connection of our results with different lattice analysis in the literature .",

    "the most general second order lagrangian is the familiar non - linear sigma model , including the gauge coupling of mesons to the electromagnetic field through the covariant derivative , plus an additional term proportional to a low - energy constant @xmath43 compatible with the @xmath2 symmetries of the qcd lagrangian @xcite :    @xmath44+c{\\mbox{tr}}\\left[ququ^\\dagger\\right ] .",

    "the vector symmetry @xmath58 is also broken for unequal quark masses and charges .",
    "thus , in the light sector ( @xmath59 ) the part of the mass term proportional to @xmath60 , the average light quark mass , is also proportional to the identity flavor matrix and therefore invariant under @xmath26 , while the part proportional to the mass difference @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the third isospin generator , is the one carrying out the qcd isospin breaking .",
    "the only remaining symmetry of the lagrangian ( [ l2 ] ) is the @xmath63 @xmath64 corresponding to charge conservation .",
    "working out the kinetic terms in ( [ l2 ] ) allows to relate the low - energy parameters @xmath65 to the leading - order tree level values for the decay constants and masses of the pseudo - goldstone bosons .",

    "this mixing between the two states with @xmath48 will play an important role in what follows .",
    "the kinetic term has then to be brought to the canonical form before identifying the gb masses , which can be easily done by the field rotation @xcite :    @xmath69    where the mixing angle is given by :    @xmath70    once the above @xmath11 rotation is performed , the @xmath4 tree level meson masses to leading order read :    @xmath71,\\nonumber\\\\ m_{k^+}^2&=&m_{k-}^2=(m_s+m_u ) b_0 + 2 c \\frac{e^2}{f^2},\\nonumber\\\\ m_{k^0}^2&=&(m_s+m_d ) b_0,\\nonumber\\\\ m_\\eta^2&=&2b_0\\left[\\frac{1}{3}(\\hat m + 2m_s)+\\frac{2}{3}(m_s-\\hat m)\\frac{\\sin^2\\varepsilon}{\\cos 2\\varepsilon}\\right ] .",

    "we emphasize that all the previous expressions hold for tree level lo masses @xmath74 with @xmath75 , in terms of which we will express all our results .",
    "they coincide with the physical masses to leading order in chpt , i.e. , @xmath76 and so on for the meson decay constants @xmath77 .",
    "the fourth - order lagrangian consists of all possible terms compatible with the qcd symmetries to that order , including the em ones .",

    "the lec are renormalized in such a way that they absorb all the one - loop ultraviolet divergences coming from @xmath86 and @xmath29 , according to the chpt counting , rendering the observables finite and scale - independent .",
    "the numerical values of the lec at a given scale can be fitted to meson experimental data , except the contact @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the latter are needed for renormalization but can not be directly measured , reflecting an ambiguity in the observables depending on them .",
    "the origin of this ambiguity is in the very same definition of the condensates in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "it is therefore convenient to define suitable combinations which are independent of those constants and therefore can be determined numerically .",
    "we will bear this in mind throughout this work and we will try to provide such combinations when isospin - breaking is included .",

    "the results are finite and scale - independent , which concerns only the @xmath39 part @xcite",
    ".    there are some important differences with respect to the @xmath24 case which deserve to be commented .",
    "first , the presence of the @xmath11 mixing angle @xmath130 ( [ mixangle ] ) , as well as the more complicated dependence of meson masses with quark masses ( [ treemassessu3 ] ) , imply that now @xmath38 corrections show up in @xmath131 , apart from the em ones . note also that these corrections in @xmath131 and @xmath132 are at least @xmath133 in the mixing angle , or equivalently in @xmath38 , except for an @xmath134 term in the kaon contribution .",
    "this is so because , apart from the explicit @xmath130 dependence , one has to expand also the meson masses in ( [ treemassessu3 ] ) around @xmath135 .",
    "all the masses depend quadratically on @xmath130 except @xmath136 , @xmath137 with @xmath138 .",
    "since , in addition , @xmath139 for @xmath135 , we end up with the above mentioned term .",
    "another important difference between the two cases is that for @xmath4 there are loop contributions to @xmath140 in ( [ condsu3dif ] ) .",
    "kaon loops arise from the charged - neutral kaon mass difference , while neutral pion and eta ones from @xmath11 mixing . when expanding in @xmath130 now",
    ", the leading order is @xmath141 even for @xmath37 .",
    "these linear terms will be crucial for our analysis of susceptibilities in section [ sec : susc ] .",
    "those loop corrections introduce now a @xmath0 dependence in @xmath140 , unlike the @xmath3 case . as it happened in the @xmath3 case",
    ", we see that @xmath140 in ( [ condsu3dif ] ) vanishes for @xmath41 and @xmath36 , in agreement with @xcite , which we see from our analysis that holds including thermal corrections .    at low and moderate temperatures @xmath142 dominates over the kaon and eta contributions in ( [ condsu3dif ] ) , but it should be reminded that @xmath130 in ( [ mixangle ] ) brings up a @xmath143 dependence which reduces the size of the pion term . in order to make a crude estimate ,",
    "let us consider again the chiral limit , but keeping now the leading order in @xmath38 , which we take then very small but nonzero while taking @xmath144 . in this limit",
    "the kaon masses are roughly kept to their physical values , which are well above the critical temperature .",
    "thus , we consider the regime @xmath145 , in which the pion term behaves as @xmath146 .",
    "the kaon and eta contributions go like @xmath147\\sqrt{m_{k,\\eta}/t}e^{-m_{k,\\eta}/t}$ ] @xcite , where we have taken also @xmath37 for simplicity .",
    "the pion term is still dominant due to the exponential suppression of @xmath148,@xmath47 .",
    "however , when compared to the @xmath39 part in that regime , which goes like @xmath149 , we see that the quadratic growth with temperature is controlled by the scale @xmath150 instead of , say , the chiral restoring behaviour of @xmath112 which is controlled by @xmath151 in the chiral limit .",
    "therefore , the order parameter for isospin breaking @xmath140 grows with @xmath0 , although it does so rather softly",
    ". therefore , we do not expect big differences in the melting temperatures of the @xmath152 and @xmath153 condensates .",
    "this is also consistent with the expectation that in the limit where @xmath19 is arbitrarily large , say compared to @xmath154 , the @xmath3 result should be recovered , for which there is no temperature dependence for the condensate difference .",
    "the evolution with temperature of the condensate difference is shown in figure [ fig : uddifsu3 ] for the full case of finite pion mass and both @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "we have used the same set of low - energy constants and parameters as in @xcite , in particular @xmath155 and @xmath156 . for the em lec @xmath157 involved ,",
    "we have displayed in the figure the two curves corresponding to their maximum and minimum expected natural values .",
    "we also show for comparison the result for @xmath36 , which shows that the charge contribution is actually of the same order as the one proportional to @xmath38 .",
    "we see that the @xmath0-dependent amplification of the isospin difference is rather large .",
    "in fact , this order parameter reaches values comparable to its @xmath39 value near the critical temperature , which is about @xmath23 265 mev in @xmath4 chpt .",
    "nevertheless , due to the additional @xmath130 suppressing factor discussed above , this enhancement is not enough to produce a sizable difference in the melting temperature of the @xmath59 condensates , as it is clearly seen in figure [ fig : uddifsu3 ] ( right ) , where we plot the two thermal condensates separately .",
    "the two plots showed in figure [ fig : uddifsu3 ] correspond then respectively to the two order parameters involved here : isospin breaking and chiral restoration . in turn , note that the curves on the right plot are independent of the choice of lec since to this order @xmath158 for @xmath159 .",

    "we have seen in section [ sec : cond ] that the @xmath169 ratio receives significant corrections at finite temperature . on the other hand ,",

    "\\label{chiconzerolo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    several remarks are in order from the previous expressions .",
    "first , we emphasize that all of them are finite and scale - independent , which can be explicitly checked from the scale dependence of the lec @xcite .",
    "we also note that , unlike the disconnected part , the connected susceptibility does not receive contributions from the mass derivative of pion tadpoles , i.e @xmath267 or @xmath268 .",
    "these turn out to be the dominant ones in the chiral limit ( see below ) and this is what we expected from our previous discussion on the infrared behaviour .",
    "thus , we identify the difference @xmath269 in ( [ chiconzerolo ] ) and the corresponding @xmath270 one in ( [ chicontlo ] ) as the contribution of @xmath11 mixing , while the @xmath271 terms come from the expansion of the kaon contribution in the r.h.s . of ( [ condsu3dif ] ) around the isospin limit . from ( [ susconmdelta ] ) ,",
    "the disconnected part receives in addition a contribution from the sum ( [ condsu3sum ] ) and hence it incorporates the @xmath267 , @xmath272 terms .",
    "note also that the @xmath39 part of @xmath191 depends on the contact term @xmath161 , while that dependence cancels in @xmath194 .",
    "this means that only quantities such as @xmath273 can be unambiguously determined , similarly as the quark condensate case ( see our discussion at the end of section [ sec : cond ] ) .",
    "this is a relevant comment for lattice evaluations of this quantity .",
    "in fact , as a consequence of the vanishing pion terms , we see that @xmath273 vanishes formally in the @xmath21 limit , recovering the pure @xmath3 result that we would get from ( [ condsu2dif ] ) , which holds also for the other susceptibilities taking into account the conversion between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 lec @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "regarding the expansion in @xmath274 , it can be seen from ( [ susconmdelta ] ) , the condensate expressions ( [ condsu3sum ] ) , ( [ condsu3dif ] ) and the meson masses and mixing angle dependence on @xmath154 and @xmath260 , that the linear order in @xmath260 cancels both in the connected and the disconnected parts and so we have written in the previous expressions and in the total susceptibility ( [ sustotsu3t])-([sustotsu3zero ] ) .",
    "it is important to remark that the @xmath275 corrections contain  tadpole mass derivative \" terms @xmath276 in both @xmath191 and @xmath194 .",
    "however , an important difference between them is that those ir dominant terms do not appear to leading order in the connected contribution .",
    "in fact , since @xmath277 , where the subscript @xmath278 indicates just the @xmath36 and @xmath279 pion , the disconnected part receives an @xmath280 proportional to the second derivative of the pion tadpole and hence more ir divergent , and so on for the thermal part @xmath281 .",
    "this contribution is not present in the connected part to that order .",
    "thus , we expect the isospin - breaking corrections to be larger in the disconnected than in the connected susceptibility .",
    "another pertinent comment is that we have been able to obtain the leading order for @xmath191 and @xmath194 only after considering properly all the @xmath1 contributions and then taking the @xmath36 limit .",
    "however , one can be led to misleading results by setting @xmath36 from the very beginning .",
    "for instance , for two equal masses one could think naively that @xmath282 , from the definition ( [ chitot ] ) .",
    "however , from our previous analysis we see that in the isospin limit what we get actually is @xmath283 and @xmath284 with @xmath191 given in ( [ chicontlo])-([chiconzerolo ] ) i.e , not vanishing for @xmath36 and physical @xmath19 , although formally suppressed in the @xmath21 limit .",
    "thus , in the isospin limit taking just one flavor susceptibility and multiplying by four does not give the total scalar susceptibility , which should be obtained instead by considering the derivative of the full sum of @xmath152 and @xmath153 condensates as given by ( [ chitot ] ) .",
    "note that this correction does not affect to condensates , for which the @xmath285 and @xmath286 difference vanishes for @xmath36 and @xmath279 and therefore @xmath287 in the isospin limit .",
    "this comment may be relevant for certain lattice analysis , where working within the  one - flavor \" equivalent framework is often done , since in that way it is easy to discuss for instance the taste - breaking effect .",
    "this observation could then help to explain the worse @xmath258 scaling properties of the susceptibility with respect to those of the condensate @xcite . in that work ,",
    "the lattice data for the susceptibility scaling function in the 2 + 1 case suffer from a sizable increase as the strange quark mass is decreased relative to the light one .",
    "that increase is not seen in the quark condensate data and could be due partly to the definition used as we have just explained , since the positive term proportional to @xmath191 increases with @xmath143 , from ( [ chicontlo])-([chiconzerolo ] ) .",
    "this is not the only effect that may cause this ",
    "wrong \" scaling , since , as pointed out in @xcite taste - breaking induces an artificial infrared pion contribution in @xmath191 which is not present in the continuum , as our above expressions show .",
    "what we are pointing out here is that the  one - flavor \" @xmath172 and @xmath173 are sensitive to isospin - breaking terms even for @xmath36 and in the continuum , unlike considering for instance the total susceptibility @xmath288 in ( [ chitot ] ) for which the @xmath191 term cancels . in addition , as we will see below , @xmath191 is dominated numerically by its @xmath39 part , which would explain why the anomalous scaling is reduced for the subtracted susceptibility .",
    "the charge corrections to susceptibilities in our previous expressions ( [ sustotsu3t])-([chiconzerolo ] ) arise only through the mass of the charged mesons @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "thus , including the charge amounts to replace @xmath289 in ( [ sustotsu3zero ] ) and ( [ chidiszerolo ] ) and @xmath290 in ( [ sustotsu3zero ] ) and ( [ chiconzerolo ] ) and so on for the thermal parts @xmath291 and @xmath292 .",
    "although for physical values of the electric charge and masses , these represent small perturbative corrections , the fact that near the chiral limit the coefficient of the ir - dominant @xmath267 and @xmath268 reduces in @xmath293 for @xmath294 is the reflection in the scalar susceptibility of the behaviour of the condensate in terms of @xmath205 corrections to the masses analyzed in section [ sec : sumrule ] .",
    "thus , when the mass corrections @xmath205 become sizable , as in the staggered lattice formalism , the susceptibility is reduced by that factor , which eventually would imply that the transition peak or maximum is displaced to a higher temperature , consistent with our analysis in the previous section about the increasing of @xmath22 in the condensates .",
    "recall that one can not just expand the pion terms in @xmath41 and then take the chiral limit , since that expansion assumes that the charge part of @xmath215 is small compared to the quark mass one .    before continuing",
    ", we also remark that our above results are compatible with the recent observation @xcite that the connected and disconnected susceptibilities can be inferred from the zero momentum limit of the @xmath295 and @xmath296 correlators calculated previously in staggered chpt @xcite .",
    "the motivation of those works is precisely to estimate the contribution of heavy pion - like tastes to the ir part of @xmath191 , which could mask the scaling behaviour .",
    "the continuum limit of the results in @xcite reveals the same @xmath297 loop contributions as in our expressions ( [ chidistlo])-([chiconzerolo ] ) .",
    "we provide the full chpt result , including the lec contribution necessary to guarantee the finiteness and scale - independency of the results , as well as the analysis of the higher order corrections in isospin breaking .",
    "as discussed above , the behaviour of the susceptibilities near the chiral limit ( ir regime ) is very illuminating regarding their approach to chiral restoration within the @xmath25 or @xmath3 pattern in the continuum , i.e. , without taste breaking effects .",
    "let us consider this regime first for @xmath39 and only for the leading order terms in the isospin expansion in ( [ chidiszerolo])-([chicontlo ] ) , i.e. , we set @xmath298 and @xmath279 in the @xmath39 susceptibilities and consider @xmath299 .",
    "we denote by a superscript  ir \" the nonvanishing terms in that limit :    @xmath300-\\frac{1}{16\\pi^2}\\left(1+\\log\\frac{m_k^2}{\\mu^2 } + \\frac{2}{3}\\log\\frac{m_\\eta^2}{\\mu^2}\\right).\\label{chiconzeroir}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the ir divergent @xmath301 term in ( [ chidiszeroir ] ) coincides with the one obtained in @xcite , where a cutoff regularization was used . multiplied by 4 , this is also the ir dominant part in the total susceptibility @xmath190 .",
    "in addition to that term , we obtain here the regular part , not ir divergent but not vanishing in the chiral limit , which provides the dependence with the lec and together with the logarithm gives the consistent scale - independent chpt prediction . as for the connected part , again only the ir divergent contribution is given in @xcite , which as commented above turns out to vanish exactly for two light fermions . here",
    "we also give the regular contribution , also scale - independent , which unlike the disconnected part depends on the contact term @xmath302 . as an interesting consistency check",
    ", we can recover the @xmath3 limit from the above expressions , using the conversion between the lec of @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite @xmath303 and @xmath304 , so that @xmath305 and @xmath306 , which is the same result that we would have starting directly from the @xmath3 expressions in ( [ condsu2sum ] ) and ( [ condsu2dif ] ) .",
    "let us consider now the dominant ir thermal contribution in the 2 + 1 flavor case , i.e , apart from @xmath299 we also consider temperatures @xmath307 , so that we neglect all the boltzmann exponentials @xmath308 and expand @xmath309 $ ] and @xmath310 @xcite .",

    "recall that , apart from the heavy masses thermal exponentials , we are neglecting also @xmath312 terms in the disconnected part ( [ chidistir ] ) .",
    "the situation is completely different for the connected contribution , which is regular , albeit not vanishing , in the chiral limit .",
    "the quadratically growing term in ( [ chicontir ] ) survives for @xmath313 against neglected @xmath314 and is dominant over @xmath308 .",
    "it vanishes formally as @xmath21 , recovering the @xmath3 limit . for physical masses",
    "though , an specific and model - independent difference between the @xmath24 and @xmath315 cases is the ( soft ) temperature dependence of the connected susceptibility , the scale that controls its growth being @xmath150 instead of the @xmath316 of the connected part .",
    "this is a consequence of @xmath194 measuring the fluctuations of the chiral restoration order parameter , while @xmath191 is related to those of the isospin - breaking one , i.e. , @xmath6 , which as we have seen in section [ sec : cond ] increases moderately .",
    "note that near the chiral limit we could as well have written the @xmath317 term divided by @xmath318 just by changing the multiplying factor .",
    "keeping @xmath150 reminds its @xmath11 origin , as it is clearly seen in the original expressions in ( [ chicontlo])-([chiconzerolo ] ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : susc ] we plot our numerical chpt results for the susceptibilities , including all the isospin - breaking corrections .",
    "the plots in that figure show the difference with respect to the @xmath39 results , which are collected in table [ tab : susczero ] . at @xmath39",
    "we use the same lec values as in @xcite , which are quoted in the table .",
    "remember that the susceptibilities are independent of the em lec and that the disconnected one is independent of contact terms .",

    "the @xmath39 results are given in table [ tab : susczero].,title=\"fig : \" ]    we see in the plots that the general features explored in our previous analytical discussion are well reproduced .",
    "first , the @xmath233 and @xmath326 terms neglected in ( [ sustotsu3t])-([sustotsu3zero ] ) and ( [ chidistlo])-([chiconzerolo ] ) are numerically small for the relevant temperature range , for physical values of quark and meson masses .",
    "in fact , as anticipated in our previous discussion , we see that those isospin corrections are larger for the disconnected than the for connected part and are also larger with temperature , all due to the appearance of ir terms proportional to the second derivative of the tadpole in @xmath194 .",
    "remember that the leading order in the isospin limit comes actually from the @xmath327 terms in the condensates .",
    "second , we appreciate qualitatively the linear and quadratic growth with temperature of the disconnected and connected parts respectively , as expected from the infrared analysis .",
    "in fact , we see that although the connected term grows faster , its absolute value is much smaller due to the @xmath150 scale compared to the @xmath316 of the disconnected part .",
    "however , it is important to note that the ir limit expressions ( [ chidistir])-([chicontir ] ) are numerically rather far from the exact ones for the physical pion mass . the difference is larger for the disconnected contribution , since , as stated above , in ( [ chidistir ] ) we are neglecting @xmath328 terms , while in ( [ chicontir ] ) the neglected terms are @xmath314 . in fact , this justifies further our present analysis , since we provide the full expressions beyond the chiral limit . also as discussed above , the infrared limit expressions for @xmath39 given in ( [ chidiszeroir])-([chiconzeroir ] )",
    "survive not only the chiral limit but also the @xmath21 one , @xmath194 still diverging but only logarithmically , which for physical masses makes the two susceptibilities numerically comparable .",
    "this is clearly seen in the values given in the first two rows of table [ tab : susczero ] .",
    "actually , for this very same reason , and following our previous discussion , the deviations of @xmath172 from the naive isospin - limit expectation @xmath329 is much more pronounced at @xmath39 than for finite @xmath0 , as it can be seen by comparing the last two columns in table [ tab : susczero ] which give about a 30% relative difference , while the last plot in figure [ fig : susc ] where we compare their thermal differences give only corrections below 10% .",
    "in fact , this is consistent with our previous discussion about the influence of the connected part in the scaling properties observed in the lattice .",
    "if we consider the subtracted susceptibilities as defined in @xcite from the subtracted condensate @xmath330 , we see that the dependence on the lec disappears in the @xmath331 limit .",
    "remember that in this limit all the @xmath39 contribution of the connected part is absorbed in @xmath332 ( see our previous comments ) and therefore considering the subtracted susceptibility is equivalent to switch off the dominant @xmath39 part of the connected susceptibility .",
    "this is indeed observed in the lattice @xcite since the subtracted susceptibility fits better the expected @xmath258 scaling behaviour than the unsubtracted one .",
    "the variation with the quark mass is displayed for @xmath333 in figure [ fig : suscmass ] and for @xmath39 in table [ tab : susczero ] .",
    "it is important to remark that we have chosen to keep fixed the ratio @xmath334 ( same value used in our previous analysis @xcite ) and @xmath19 , while we vary @xmath335 above and below the physical quark mass ratio . in other words ,",
    "when @xmath336 , @xmath337 while @xmath338 remain fixed .",
    "this is meant to be the relevant limit when approaching chiral restoration .",
    "in addition , since we can write @xmath339 , @xmath130 scales in this limit as @xmath340 .",
    "recall that , although the values of the @xmath341 are fitted to low - energy data with physical masses @xcite , those lec are formally independent of the quark masses @xcite . the same applies to the tree level value of @xmath33 we are using .     quark mass dependence of the thermal disconnected , connected and total susceptibilities in three - flavor chpt , for fixed @xmath19 and fixed @xmath40 .",
    "we also show the isospin limit ( il ) @xmath320 and @xmath279 in the smaller light mass case .",
    "the @xmath39 results are given in table [ tab : susczero ] .",

    "the @xmath39 results are given in table [ tab : susczero ] .",

    "we also show the isospin limit ( il ) @xmath320 and @xmath279 in the smaller light mass case .",
    "the @xmath39 results are given in table [ tab : susczero ] .",
    "for comparison , we also display the infrared limit in the @xmath342 case.,title=\"fig : \" ]    as we expected from our previous ir analysis in eqns .",
    "( [ chidistir ] ) and ( [ chicontir ] ) , the light quark mass dependence of the thermal disconnected susceptibility is much stronger than the connected one , as seen clearly in fig.[fig : suscmass ] and as long as we take the limit in the order specified above . in terms of chiral restoration , this anticipates a much stronger growth or peak near @xmath22 for the disconnected part . from the same arguments .",
    "the behaviour of the connected part is expected to be softer near the transition , although growing with @xmath317 for low and moderate temperatures .",
    "we also show in the figure the comparison with the infrared limit for the smaller @xmath343 case , where it can be seen that the curves are now closer than for the physical pion mass case in figure [ fig : susc ] .",
    "in addition , the isospin corrections are also more important for the disconnected part , where they actually increase as @xmath344 is decreased , than for the connected one , where the isospin limit and complete curves are almost indistinguishable in the figure .",
    "the same holds for the @xmath39 contributions in table [ tab : susczero ] . according to our previous discussion ,",
    "this behaviour of the isospin corrections arises from the dominant ir terms @xmath345 as compared to @xmath346 .",
    "this effect is weaker for the @xmath39 contributions since the ir leading corrections @xmath347 ( in @xmath191 ) and @xmath348 ( in @xmath194 ) diverge softly , namely , as @xmath349 and @xmath154 respectively .",
    "thus , although the isospin corrections are amplified in the disconnected susceptibility for large temperatures and small masses , they are still perturbatively under control in the chiral limit .",
    "the limit where @xmath343 vanishes not by taking @xmath144 but keeping @xmath154 fixed and taking @xmath21 is where we recover the pure @xmath3 results , as discussed before . in that case , it is the connected part which is more sensitive to the quark mass variation , vanishing for large @xmath150 , while the disconnected one remains invariant .",
    "although this is formally interesting for connecting the @xmath3 and @xmath4 cases , it is not so relevant for studying the critical behaviour .",
    "in this work we have analyzed the relevant observables regarding chiral symmetry restoration , namely quark condensates and scalar susceptibilities , in the presence of isospin breaking .",
    "we have considered on the same footing the qcd ( @xmath40 mass difference ) and electromagnetic corrections , to one loop in chiral perturbation theory , both in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 sectors .",
    "our analysis provides useful and model - independent results regarding several relevant aspects of isospin breaking and chiral restoration , which may be particularly interesting for lattice studies .",
    "the sum @xmath350 , the order parameter for chiral restoration , receives small isospin - breaking corrections for the physical values of masses and electric charge .",
    "these corrections affect only slightly , less than @xmath351 , to the value of the critical temperature , which they increase as a ferromagnetic response .",
    "the difference @xmath140 is the order parameter of isospin breaking .",
    "it is temperature independent in the @xmath3 limit , but when kaons and eta are included , it shows an increasing behaviour , which in the chiral limit is given by @xmath352 .",
    "the deviations with respect to its @xmath39 value become sizable as the temperature is increased , but they are controlled by a larger energy scale @xmath150 than the typical @xmath353 of @xmath350 .",
    "this large growth of isospin breaking does not reflect in the chiral restoration temperatures of @xmath354 and @xmath355 , which remain close to each other , consistently with the idea that chiral restoration is little affected .",
    "we have also evaluated the temperature corrections to the sum rule relating the @xmath356 and @xmath357 ratios , which is useful because it does not involve undetermined contact low - energy constants .",
    "the corrections in this case come directly from the @xmath169 ratio and are therefore rather large for the temperatures of interest .",
    "a very important part of the present work has been the analysis of scalar susceptibilities in the isospin asymmetric scenario .",
    "we have related the different flavor susceptibilities with the total , quark connected and quark disconnected susceptibilities often used in lattice analysis .",
    "electromagnetic corrections to the quark condensate turn out to be directly related by a sum rule to the total susceptibility and then to the growth of fluctuations , which is meant to be maximum near the critical point .",
    "this sum rule is valid for any small deviation of the pion masses , as for instance the one arising in the staggered lattice formalism due to taste breaking effects .",
    "actually , we have made rough estimates of the corrections to condensates expected from this source , comparing lattices of different sizes among them and with the continuum limit .",
    "these estimates are in good agreement with the errors quoted in the lattice works .",
    "the isospin asymmetric calculation allows for a direct extraction of the connected and disconnected susceptibilities , even in the isospin symmetric limit .",
    "the terms in @xmath140 linearly proportional to @xmath38 give contributions to the connected part not vanishing in the isospin limit and which affect for instance the naive extrapolation of a given flavor susceptibility to the total one .",
    "our analysis provides model - independent predictions for the mass , temperature and isospin dependence of those quantities , which should be recovered in lattice analysis as they approach the continuum limit . in accordance with the behaviour of the corresponding order parameters ,",
    "the disconnected susceptibility shows a linear growth at low and moderate temperatures , infrared divergent near the chiral limit as @xmath9 , whereas the connected one is infrared regular but survives the chiral limit as a growing @xmath10 behaviour .",
    "the chiral or infrared limit gives qualitatively the behaviour as the temperature approaches chiral restoration but numerically is not a good approximation for physical pion masses .",
    "the higher order isospin breaking corrections are quadratic in @xmath38 and are enhanced in the chiral limit for the disconnected susceptibility , as long as @xmath19 and @xmath40 remain fixed .",
    "the chpt susceptibilities reproduce the growing @xmath0-dependence at low and moderate temperatures in a model - independent way .",
    "although they do not show the peaks expected near the transition , our small mass analysis allows to infer that the disconnected part should have a more pronounced peak than the connected one , the latter expected to present a rather soft behaviour .",
    "this difference can be interpreted from the different order parameters that fluctuate in each case : the chiral quark condensate for the disconnected piece and the isospin - breaking one in the connected case . in the formal @xmath3 limit @xmath21",
    "the connected contribution becomes temperature independent , like @xmath140 .",
