    "such degeneracies are often present in 2d materials with a honeycomb - like structure , such as graphene , boron nitride , and transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmd ) . in these materials ,",
    "weak intervalley scattering renders the valley index an effective degree of freedom that can be utilized in novel devices .",
    "this realization of valley - based electronics is called valleytronics , which depends crucially on the _ dynamical _ control of two quantities : valley polarization and valley current .",
    "the optical generation of valley polarization by circularly polarized light  @xcite shows some promise as a realization of valleytronics and has been experimentally demonstrated in monolayer mos@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , so far only valley - polarized electric current has been reported .",
    "@xcite in analogy to spintronics , it would be desirable to generate a pure valley current , in which there is no net motion of charge ; carriers in opposite valley move in opposite direction .",
    "such a pure valley current would rule out any charge - related effect  @xcite and generate minimal joule heating , similar to a pure spin current  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a new approach to the generation and detection of a pure valley current by optical means .",
    "based on both symmetry analysis and an effective @xmath1 hamiltonian , we show that a pure valley current can be generated by linearly polarized light in monolayer tmds .",
    "the generating mechanism parallels that for spin current .",
    "@xcite however , the role of spin - orbit coupling is replaced by the trigonal warping in the band structure , which is entirely a lattice effect . due to the unique spin - valley coupling in this system ,  @xcite the generated valley current is accompanied by a spin current .",
    "we also present a theory for valley diffusion that takes into account the spin - valley coupling , and show that the pure valley current can be detected by either photoluminescence measurements or the ultrafast pump - probe technique .",
    "our method , together with the previously demonstrated generation of valley polarization ,  @xcite opens up the exciting possibility of ultrafast optical - only manipulation of the valley index .",

    "[ fig : lpge](a ) , the band dispersion of the effective model is plotted for @xmath105 , which clearly shows the large spin splitting in the valence bands . due to the @xmath7 symmetry , optical transitions excite states with different @xmath106 in each valley .",
    "this results in different optical transition rates ( indicated by the thickness of the arrow ) and different velocity in the @xmath107 direction , both of which contribute to generating the valley photocurrent .",

    "we note that as soon as the lower spin - split valence band becomes active , the spin current displays a downward trend .",
    "this allows us to manipulate the generation of valley and spin current either collectively or separately .",
    "next we discuss the detection of the pure valley current .",
    "our idea utilizes the fact that the valley carriers in monolayer tmd are described by a pair of massive dirac fermions with opposite mass ,  @xcite therefore each valley exhibits opposite time - reversal symmetry breaking effects such as circular dichroism  @xcite and faraday rotation .",
    "@xcite note that there is a possible complication due to the large exciton binding energy observed in monolayer tmd ,  @xcite which makes the generation of free carriers difficult . to remove the exciton effect , we may heavily dope the sample  @xcite or apply a large in - plane electric field .   under these circumstances ,",
    "we propose two possible detection schemes .      in one scheme , one can observe the second - harmonic generation ( shg ) of the valley current using the ultrafast pump - probe technique  @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : detection](a ) .",
    "this is similar to the proposed detection method of spin current .",
    "@xcite first , the pump light ( with frequency @xmath111 ) generates a pure valley current .",
    "then the probe light ( with frequency @xmath112 ) creates a population imbalance between @xmath13 and @xmath113 states , which leads to a net faraday rotation .",
    "this will induce a polarized field @xmath114 , and emit a second - harmonic signal ( orthogonal to the probe light ) .",
    "since the energy of the shg is still below the band gap @xmath89 , the faraday rotation is related to the virtual interband transition , which distinguishes it from other optical effects of the pump light .",
    "an alternative proposal , unique to monolayer tmd , is to investigate the photoluminescence ( pl ) helicity as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : detection](b ) .",
    "suppose a linearly polarized light illuminates the central region , generating a steady valley current .",
    "as the valley carriers move outside of the central region , they will start the diffusion process described by @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the diffusion constant  derived from the fermi velocity @xmath117 and the momentum relaxation time @xmath24and @xmath118 is the chemical potential difference between the two valleys .",
    "this equation describes both electrons and holes .",
    "consider the right region of the sample .",
    "for a valley current with initial velocity @xmath119 , where @xmath120 corresponds to holes ( electrons ) and @xmath121 is the total longitudinal ( drude ) conductivity , we obtain @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the valley diffusion length . in monolayer tmd , we have @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the electron - hole recombination time .",
    "@xcite therefore , after a diffusion length @xmath126 , holes will have a local chemical potential difference @xmath127 ; meanwhile , electrons become almost equally populated in the two valleys and @xmath128 . following the valley - contrasting circular dichroism ,",
    "@xcite this leads to a net @xmath129 pl hecility .",
    "a similar argument can be applied to the left region of the sample , where a net @xmath130 pl is expected .",
    "experimental results found  @xcite that @xmath131 ns , which leads to @xmath132 @xmath33 m ; they further determined that @xmath133 ps , resulting in a pl helicity @xmath134 .",
    "note that this phenomenon is intimately related to the spin - valley coupled bands , and hence absent in other multi - valleyed systems such as staggered monolayer or biased bilayer graphene .    .",

    "so far we have considered the normal incidence case . for oblique incidence ,",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab : oblique ] , where the general form of the valley - resolved current @xmath137 along the longitudinal ( transverse ) direction is given .",
    "@xmath138 refers to valleys @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and the @xmath139 plane is the incident plane . for a linearly",
    "polarized light , valley current is induced in both longitudinal and transverse directions ; in contrast , only the longitudinal valley current is generated under circularly polarized light . in both cases ,",
    "charge current vanishes since @xmath140 due to the mirror symmetry under @xmath68 , leading to a pure valley current .",
    "apart from the pge , there exists another photocurrent generating mechanism under the oblique incidence , namely the photon drag effect ( pde ) .",
    "@xcite in this case , photons transfer both momentum and angular momentum to carriers , and the current is described by @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is a rank-4 tensor and @xmath143 is the photon wavevector .",
    "similar to the pge , pde contributes to the valley current under both linearly and circularly polarized light .",
    "however , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , indicating that the net charge current does not necessarily vanish in the system . to distinguish these two mechanisms in experiments , one notices the fact that the response from pde ( pge ) is an odd ( even ) function under the reversal of incident direction @xmath146 , by which the dominant mechanism can be identified .",
    "the proposal of pure valley current generation can be generalized to other systems with appropriate symmetries , however , the magnitude of the effect and the detection scheme may vary among different systems . in our view",
    ", monolayer tmd has its advantage that the specific band and symmetries allow peculiar detection and observable signal .    to conclude",
    ", we have demonstrated that a linearly - polarized light can induce a pure valley current in monolayer tmd .",
    "this mechanism originates from the @xmath7-symmetry rather than spin - orbit coupling .",
    "furthermore , we propose two realistic optical approaches to detect the pure valley current . the effect of oblique incidence is also discussed .",
