    "the structure of networks has been mainly the domain of a branch of discrete mathematics known as graph theory .",
    "some basic ideas , used later by physicists , were proposed in 1959 by the hungarian mathematician paul erds and his collaborator rnyi .",
    "graph theory has witnessed many exciting developments and has provided answers to a series of practical questions such as : what is the maximum flow per unit time from source to sink in a network of pipes or how to color the regions of a map using the minimum number of colours so that neighbouring regions receive different colors among other important problems .",
    "in addition to the developments in mathematical graph theory , the study of networks has seen important achievements in some specialized contexts , as for instance in the social sciences .",
    "most of the results of graph theory relevant to large complex networks , are related to the simplest models of random graphs .",
    "recent years however have witnessed a substantial new movement in network research , with the focus shifting away from the analysis of single small graphs and the properties of individual vertices or edges to considerations of  large scale \" statistical properties .",
    "the great majority of real world networks , including the world wide web , the internet , basic cellular networks , social networks and many others have a more complex architecture than classical random graphs .",
    "abstracting the network details away allows one to concentrate on the phenomena intrinsically connected with the underlying geometry , and discover connections between the metric properties and the network characteristics . over the past few years",
    ", there has been growing evidence that many communication networks have characteristics of negatively curved spaces @xcite . from the large scale point of view",
    ", it has been experimentally observed that , on the internet and other networks , traffic seems to concentrate quite heavily on some very small subsets .",
    "we believe that many of the complex real world networks have characteristics of negatively curved or more generally gromov s hyperbolic spaces . in figure 1",
    ", we observe a picture of the world wide web and the internet network that suggests a hyperbolic structure .",
    "in this project we continue the analysis and approach done in @xcite .",
    "we study the traffic behaviour for large gromov s hyperbolic spaces when the traffic rate decays exponentially with the metric distance between the nodes .",
    "we prove that under general conditions there exists a phase transition between local and global traffic .",
    "more specifically , assume that the traffic rate between two nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 in our network is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the distance between the nodes .",
    "we show that there exists a constant @xmath4 such that if @xmath5 the traffic is global and there is a small set of highly congested nodes called the core . however , if @xmath6 then the traffic is essentially local and the core is empty .",
    "this implies in particular , that polynomially decaying rate functions do not affect the locality of the traffic , and the existence or non  existence of a core .",
    "the dichotomy of global versus local traffic is more important than ever .",
    "a recent study showed that the consumer broadband usage and global ip network traffic continues to climb at an overwhelming pace due to new forms and expanded usage of interactive media , and the explosion of video content across multiple devices .",
    "the study projects that global ip traffic will increase fivefold by 2013 .",
    "the major growth driver is video and it is expected that by 2013 the sum of all forms of video ( tv , vod , internet video and p2p ) will exceed 90% of the total consumer ip traffic .",
    "this , if not handled appropriate , will generate huge congestions in our networks .",
    "our results in particular imply that if we foment and incentive local traffic instead of global traffic this problem can be minimized .",
    "[ internet ]        in section [ prelim ] , we review the concept of gromov s hyperbolic space and present some of the important examples and properties .",
    "we also recall the construction of the boundary of an hyperbolic space and its visual metric . in section [ tree ] , we study the traffic phenomena in a general locally finite tree when the rate decays exponentially with the distance .",
    "finally , in section [ hyper ] we study the asymptotic traffic behaviour in general gromov s hyperbolic graphs when the traffic decays exponentially with the distance and prove our main results .",

    "in this section we review the notion of gromov s @xmath7hyperbolic space as well as some of the basic properties , theorems and constructions .",
    "there are many equivalent definitions of gromov s hyperbolicity but the one we take as our definition is the property that triangles are _",
    "slim_.    let @xmath8 .",
    "a geodesic triangle in a metric space @xmath9 is said to be @xmath7slim if each of its sides is contained in the @xmath7neighbourhood of the union of the other two sides . a geodesic space @xmath9 is said to be @xmath7hyperbolic if every triangle in @xmath9 is @xmath7slim .",
    "it is easy to see that any tree is @xmath10-hyperbolic .",
    "other examples of hyperbolic spaces include , any finite graph , the fundamental group of a surface of genus greater or equal than 2 , the classical hyperbolic space , and any regular tessellation of the hyperbolic space ( i.e. infinite planar graphs with uniform degree @xmath11 and @xmath12gons as faces with @xmath13 ) .",
    "( hyperbolic group ) a finitely generated group @xmath14 is said to be word ",
    "hyperbolic if there is a finite generating set @xmath15 such that the cayley graph @xmath16 is @xmath7hyperbolic with respect to the word metric for some @xmath7 .",
    "it turns out that if @xmath14 is a word hyperbolic group then for any finite generating set @xmath15 of @xmath14 the corresponding cayley graph is hyperbolic , although the hyperbolicity constant depends on the choice of @xmath15 .",
    "( gromov s product ) let @xmath17 be a metric space . for @xmath18 and @xmath19 we define @xmath20    we call @xmath21 the gromov s product of @xmath22 and @xmath23 with respect to @xmath24 .    in hyperbolic metric spaces",
    "the gromov s product measures how long two geodesics travel close together .",
    "namely if @xmath18 and @xmath23 are three points in a @xmath7 hyperbolic metric space @xmath17 , then the initial segments of length @xmath21 of any two geodesics @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath26 $ ] are @xmath27 hausdorff close . moreover",

    "we say that two geodesic rays @xmath29 and @xmath30 are equivalent and write @xmath31 if there is @xmath32 such that for any @xmath33 @xmath34 it is easy to see that @xmath35 is indeed an equivalence relation on the set of geodesic rays .",
    "moreover , two geodesic rays @xmath36 are equivalent if and only if their images have finite hausdorff distance .",
    "the hausdorff distance is defined as the infimum of all the numbers @xmath37 such that the images of @xmath38 is contained in the @xmath37neighbourhood of the image of @xmath39 and vice versa .",
    "the boundary is usually defined as the set of equivalence classes of geodesic rays starting at the base ",
