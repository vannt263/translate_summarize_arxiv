    "precise radial - velocity measurements of stars have revealed more than 500 extrasolar planets in the last 20 years .",
    "thanks to the increase in velocity precision and the duration of the planet search programs , not only single planets but also many multiple - planet systems have been discovered . around solar - type stars , including those systems with long - term radial - velocity trends , @xmath43050 % of stars with giant planets are multiple - planet systems @xcite , and systems comprising less massive planets such as super - earths and neptune - mass planets are more abundant @xcite .",
    "the multiple - planet systems give us deep insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for example , evidence of planet - planet scattering events could be preserved in the current orbital configurations of planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the prevalence of orbital mean - motion resonances constitutes strong support for differential convergent orbital migration having occurred ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their statistical properties may also provide us hints about the mechanisms of these processes ; the rather uniform semimajor axis distribution without the pileup of hot jupiters and the jump at 1 au that are seen in single planets , and systematically lower eccentricities compared to single planets @xcite .",
    "studying the long - term orbital stability of multiple - planet systems is also important . since the best fit orbital parameters derived from radial - velocity data do not necessarily guarantee that the resulting orbits are stable over long periods of time , dynamical stability analysis can check and further constrain the system parameters , such that the solutions consistent with the data are stable ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we report the detection of a double giant - planet system around the evolved intermediate - mass star hd 4732 ( k0 iv , @xmath5 ) , one of the 300 targets of the okayama planet search program ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this discovery was facilitated by joint precise radial - velocity observations made from the anglo - australian observatory .",
    "discoveries of planets and multiple - planet systems around such intermediate - mass stars have been rapidly growing in number during the past several years .",
    "although the number of known multiple - planet systems around intermediate - mass stars is still small , it is interesting that many of them appear to be in mean - motion resonances such as 24 sex ( 2:1 ; * ? ? ?",

    "although detailed dynamical studies are required to determine whether these systems are truly in resonance , the existence of such systems suggests that the planetary orbital migration process for intermediate - mass stars is similar to that for solar - type ones .    this paper is organized as follows .",

    "hd 4732 ( hr 228 , hip 3834 ) is listed in the hipparcos catalog @xcite as a k0 giant with the apparent @xmath7-band magnitude @xmath8 and the parallax @xmath9 mas , giving the distance of 56.5@xmath103.2 pc and the absolute visual magnitude @xmath11 taking into account the correction of interstellar extinction @xmath12 based on @xcite s table @xcite .",
    "atmospheric parameters ( effective temperature @xmath13 , surface gravity @xmath14 , micro - turbulent velocity @xmath15 , and fe abundance [ fe / h ] ) of all the targets for okayama planet search program were derived by @xcite based on the spectroscopic approach using the equivalent widths of well - behaved fe i and fe ii lines of iodine - free stellar spectra .",

    "the stellar radius @xmath27 was estimated to be @xmath28 using the stefan - boltzmann relationship and the measured @xmath23 and @xmath13 .",
    "although the star is listed in the hipparcos catalog as a giant star , the star is better regarded as a subgiant rather than giant based on the surface gravity and its position on the hr diagram ( fig [ fig - hrd ] ) .",
    "the stellar properties are summarized in table [ tbl - stars ] .",
    "hipparcos observations revealed photometric stability for the star down to @xmath29 mag .",
    "furthermore , the star shows no significant emission in the core of ca ii hk lines as shown in figure [ fig - cah ] , which suggests that the star is chromospherically inactive . for subgiants like hd 4732 , @xcite reported a typical radial - velocity jitter , which arises from a number of phenomena intrinsic to the star such as granulation , oscillation , and activity , of about 5 m s@xmath19 .",
    "the value is comparable to that of 6 m s@xmath19 estimated for hd 4732 in section [ ana ] .",
    "observations of hd 4732 at oao were made with the 1.88 m telescope and the high dispersion echelle spectrograph ( hides ; * ? ? ? * ) from august 2004 to january 2012 .",
    "a slit width of the spectrograph was set to 200 @xmath30 m ( @xmath31 ) corresponding to a spectral resolution ( @xmath32 ) of 67000 by about 3.3 pixels sampling . for precise radial - velocity measurements",
    ", we used an iodine absorption cell ( i@xmath33 cell ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which provides a fiducial wavelength reference in a wavelength range of 50005800@xmath34 .",
    "we have obtained 48 data points of hd 4732 with signal - to - noise ratio s / n@xmath3560250 pix@xmath19 by an exposure time of 9001800 sec depending on the weather condition .",
    "the reduction of echelle data ( i.e. bias subtraction , flat - fielding , scattered - light subtraction , and spectrum extraction ) was performed using the iraf software package in the standard way .    for radial - velocity analysis",
    ", we modeled i@xmath33-superposed stellar spectra ( star+i@xmath33 ) by the method detailed in @xcite and @xcite , which is based on the method by @xcite and @xcite . in the method , we model a star+i@xmath33 spectrum as a product of a high resolution i@xmath33 and a stellar template spectrum convolved with a modeled point spread function ( psf ) of the spectrograph .",
    "we obtain the stellar spectrum by deconvolving a pure stellar spectrum with the spectrograph psf estimated from an i@xmath33-superposed b - star spectrum .",
    "we have achieved a long - term doppler precision of about 45 m s@xmath19 over a time span of 9 years .",
    "measurement error was derived from an ensemble of velocities from each of @xmath4300 spectral chunks ( each @xmath43@xmath34 long ) in every exposure .",
    "we listed the derived radial velocities for oao data in table  [ oaovels ] together with the estimated uncertainties .",
    "as hd4732 is near the southern limit for oao ( @xmath36 ) , it is desirable to make observations from a more southerly site . to improve the phase coverage for hd4732 , in 2010 september we began observing it with the ucles echelle spectrograph @xcite at the 3.9-metre anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) .",
    "ucles achieves a resolution of 45,000 with a 1@xmath37 slit .",
    "an iodine absorption cell provides wavelength calibration from 5000 to 6200 .",
    "the spectrograph psf and wavelength calibration are derived from the iodine absorption lines embedded on every pixel of the spectrum by the cell @xcite .",
    "the result is a precision doppler velocity estimate for each epoch , along with an internal uncertainty estimate , which includes the effects of photon - counting uncertainties , residual errors in the spectrograph psf model , and variation in the underlying spectrum between the iodine - free template , and epoch spectra observed through the iodine cell .",
    "the photon - weighted mid - time of each exposure is determined by an exposure meter .",
    "this technique has been successfully used at the aat by the anglo - australian planet search ( e.g. tinney et al .",
    "2001 , otoole et al .",
    "2009 , jones et al .",
    "2010 , tinney et al .",
    "2011a ) and the pan - pacific planet search @xcite .",
    "all velocities are measured relative to the zero - point defined by the template observation .",
    "aat / ucles precision velocities are obtained using the _ austral _ code @xcite .",
    "we have obtained 19 aat observations of hd4732 , and an iodine - free template observation was obtained on 2010 oct 25 .",
    "exposure times ranged from 400 to 1200 s , with a resulting s / n of @xmath4100 - 200 per pixel each epoch .",
    "the aat data span a total of 636 days , and have a mean internal velocity uncertainty of 5.0 .",
    "the data are given in table  [ aatvels ] .",
    "for candidate multiple - planet systems , and for planet candidates with orbital periods near one year , it is critical to obtain the most complete possible phase coverage , and it is ideal to independently confirm the signal(s ) from independent observatories .",
    "a recent example is hd38283b , a 0.34  planet with a period @xmath381.6 days @xcite .",
    "that planet required 12 years of observations to confirm , and a robust detection was further aided by the fact that hd38283 is circumpolar and so could be observed year - round ( although at high airmasses below the pole ) .",
    "another example is hd159868c , which has a period @xmath391.3 days @xcite , also worryingly close to one year .",
    "again , more than 9 years of aat data were needed for a secure detection , and the 352-day period was confirmed independently with keck data over a 4-year span @xcite .",
    "five years of radial - velocity observations of hd4732 at oao revealed evidence of a signal with a period near one year ( @xmath4338 days ) . since this star is near the southern limit for oao , it is only observable for 5 months of the year , resulting in persistent phase gaps which make the confirmation of such a period extremely difficult .",
    "aat observations in 2010 - 2011 filled in the critical phase gaps and confirmed the orbital period suggested by the oao data . continued observations from both telescopes in 2011 - 2012 have also revealed a second velocity signal , first manifesting as a residual trend , and subsequently as a second , long periodicity .",
    "to fit the two keplerian signals evident in the hd4732 data , we first employed a genetic algorithm .",
    "this approach has proven useful in previous work where it was necessary to fit highly uncertain orbits with long periods near the total duration of observations @xcite .",
    "we ran the genetic algorithm for 10,000 iterations , each consisting of  1000 individual trial fits .",
    "the best - fit set of parameters is thus the result of @xmath40 trial fits .",
    "the parameters of the best 2-planet solution obtained by the genetic algorithm were then used as initial inputs for the gaussfit code @xcite , a nonlinear least - squares fitting routine .",
    "the gaussfit model has the ability to allow the offsets between data sets to be a free parameter .",
    "this is important because the radial velocities from oao and aat are not absolute radial velocities , but rather are measured relative to the iodine - free stellar template .",
    "each data set thus has an arbitrary zero - point offset which must be accounted for in the orbit - fitting procedure @xcite .",
    "these offsets are 3.8@xmath103.2  ( oao ) and @xmath410.1@xmath103.7  ( aat ) .    for the final orbit fitting , we added radial - velocity jitter in quadrature to the velocity uncertainty of each observation .",
    "this jitter arises from a number of phenomena intrinsic to the star , such as granulation , oscillations , and activity @xcite .",
    "as hd4732 is an evolved star , scaling relations @xcite are not applicable .",
    "we thus determine the appropriate level of jitter empirically , by performing two - keplerian fits with varying levels of jitter . on some dates ,",
    "the aat recorded multiple consecutive exposures of hd4732 ( table  [ aatvels ] ) .",
    "this provides one way to estimate the jitter : by noting the velocity spread of the multiple exposures . on the four dates which had multiple exposures ,",
    "the mean velocity spread is 2.9 .",
    "this is , however , a lower limit as the timescales of many jitter sources are on the order of hours ( granulation ) or months ( rotation ) .",
    "we also try a range of jitters from 410 , and note the results of the fits in table  [ jitfits ] .",
    "the estimation of radial - velocity jitter is quite uncertain , and this is reflected in table  [ jitfits ] , where we see that the amount of added jitter has little effect on the quality of the resulting fit .",
    "we adopt a jitter estimate of 6 , as this value brings the reduced @xmath42 of the fit close to unity .",
    "the resulting 2-keplerian planetary parameters are given in table  [ planetparams ] .",
    "the uncertainties on the fitted parameters are derived in the usual way , from the covariance matrix of the least - squares fit .",
    "the phase gap for planet b has the greatest impact on the uncertainty in @xmath43 for that planet . as a result ,",
    "the uncertainty @xmath44=18.4 days remains large even though many orbital cycles of planet b have been observed .",
    "the two - planet fit has a reduced @xmath42 of 1.05 , and the rms scatter about the fit is 7.09 . using a stellar mass of @xmath45 @xcite , the planets have minimum masses m  sin  @xmath46 of 2.4@xmath100.3 ( inner planet ) and 2.4@xmath100.4 ( outer planet ) .",
    "in order to investigate other possible causes of observed radial - velocity variations such as pulsation and rotational modulation rather than orbital motion , spectral line shape analysis was performed with use of high resolution stellar template spectra .",
    "details of the analysis method are described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "at first , two stellar templates were extracted from five star+i@xmath33 spectra at phases with different radial - velocity level , @xmath4 40 m s@xmath19 and @xmath4720 m s@xmath19 , of the observed radial velocities based on the method by @xcite .",
    "cross correlation profiles of the two templates were calculated for about 90 spectral chunks ( 45@xmath34 width each ) in which severely blended lines or broad lines were not included , and then three bisector quantities were derived for the cross correlation profile for each chunk : the velocity span ( bvs ) , which is the velocity difference between two flux levels of the bisector ; the velocity curvature ( bvc ) , which is the difference of the velocity span of the upper half and lower half of the bisector ; and the velocity displacement ( bvd ) , which is the average of the bisector at three different flux levels .",
    "here we used flux levels of 25% , 50% , and 75% of the cross correlation profile to calculate the above three bisector quantities , and obtained bvs@xmath353.9@xmath104.7 m s@xmath19 , bvc@xmath352.4@xmath103.3 m s@xmath19 , and bvd@xmath4857@xmath1011 m s@xmath19 for hd 4732 ( figure [ fig : bvs ] ) .",
    "both of the bvs and the bvc are identical to zero and the average bvd agrees with the velocity difference between the two templates . then the cross correlation profiles can be considered to be symmetric and thus the observed radial - velocity variations are best explained by parallel shifts of the spectral lines rather than distortion of them , which is consistent with the orbital - motion hypothesis .",
    "we here present dynamical studies of the hd 4732 system . since the eccentricities of the planets are relatively small and it is thus considered that they probably have not experienced close encounters , we here assume that the both planets share the same orbital plane and are prograde . for the numerical integrations , we use a 4-th order hermite scheme .",
    "figure  [ fig : orbitcalc ] shows the one million year evolution of the best - fit two - keplerian model derived in section [ ana ] , for @xmath49 orbits ( i.e.  planet masses at minimum ) . the system has two secular eigenfrequencies related with eccentricity , 11@xmath37/yr and 28@xmath37/yr .",
    "accordingly , the planetary pericenter , @xmath50 , and apocenter , @xmath51 , distances oscillate with the secular timescale of 76000 yr .    for lower inclinations , since the mass increases proportional to @xmath52 , mutual perturbations become stronger . the stability map in the ( @xmath53 ) plane of the outer planet for different values of @xmath46",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stablmap ] . here",
    "we plot the stability index @xmath54 ( in @xmath55/yr ) following @xcite , which studied stability of hd202206 system using laskar s frequency map analysis @xcite .",
    "following the analysis , we calculate an average of mean motion of the outer planet in 1000 kepler periods ( @xmath56 ) and subtract it from an average of mean motion of the same planet obtained in the next consecutive 1000 kepler periods ( @xmath57 ) . through comparison with the five times longer simulations , we find that the system is regular when @xmath58 ( blue to navy ) , while the system is chaotic when @xmath59 ( yellow to red ) .",
    "as inclination decreases , the system loses stability .",
    "there is no stable area around 1@xmath60 of the best fitted coplanar orbits for @xmath61 .",
    "thus , in the coplanar prograde configuration , we can roughly set the upper limit on the mass of both of the two planets to be about @xmath62 @xmath63 , which falls in the substellar mass regime .    in top",
    "left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : stablmap ] , one can find effects of mean - motion resonances as green vertical incisions . in the case of this system , based on the best - fit values of argument of pericenter , orbits closer to the mean - motion resonances are more unstable .",
    "the best - fit solution derived by the radial - velocity data ( white cross ) sits between the 7:1 and 8:1 mean - motion resonances . from the orbital integration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbitcalc ] , we have also confirmed that their resonant angles are not librating .",
    "we thus conclude that the outer planet is not in the mean - motion resonances of the inner planet .",
    "we report the detection of a double planet system around the evolved intermediate - mass star hd 4732 ( k0 iv , @xmath5 ) by precise radial - velocity measurements at oao and aao .",
    "the system is composed of two giant planets with minimum masses of @xmath64 , orbital period of 360.2 d and 2732 d , and eccentricity of 0.13 and 0.23 , respectively .",
    "the joint observations of oao and aao allowed us to increase the phase coverage of the nearly 1-yr periodicity of the inner planet and detect long - period signal of the second outer planet .",
    "the configuration of the system is similar to those of other multiple - planet systems currently known : two giant planets in a combination of intermediate- and long - period orbits with relatively low eccentricities .",
    "hd 4732 c is the outer most planetary candidate ( @xmath65 ) ever discovered around intermediate - mass stars except for those discovered by direct imaging .",
    "oph c ( @xmath66 , a=6.1 au ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the outer most brown - dwarf companion ever discovered around intermediate - mass stars by radial velocity measurements . ]",
    "the period ratio of the two planets is close to 7:1 or 8:1 , but dynamical analysis showed that the system is not in the mean - motion resonance and orbits close to mean - motion resonances are unstable in this case .",
    "one million year orbital evolution of the best - fit two - keplerian model in a coplanar prograde configuration showed no significant changes in eccentricities , but showed their slight oscillations with secular timescale of 76000 yr .",
    "based on the dynamical stability analysis , we found that the system is dynamically unstable in the case of @xmath67 for a coplanar prograde configuration .",
    "thus , we can set the upper limit on the mass of both of the two planets to be about 28 @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) in this case , which falls well into the substellar mass regime .",
    "this research is based on data collected at okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) , which is operated by national astronomical observatory of japan , and at the anglo - australian observatory .",
