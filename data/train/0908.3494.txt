    "direct observation of the cosmic ray electronic component ( which includes both electrons and positrons ) without any charge discrimination dates back to the early 1960s , and since that time , the energy range and the sensitivity of the observations have increased systematically . to date , we have at hand data from three new instruments , fermi @xcite , atic @xcite , and hess ( aharonian et al . 2008 , 2009 ) , that have the requisite sensitivity to measure , with good statistical accuracy , the spectrum of the total electronic component ( @xmath1 ) well into the tev region .",
    "the reported spectrum in the region @xmath2 gev may be parameterized as [ eq : spect ] f_t(e)=i_t e^-_t with @xmath3 up to @xmath4 tev , and the value of @xmath5 increases to @xmath6 3.9 at higher energies .",
    "furthermore , the atic collabortion has reported a narrow enhancement of the intensities around @xmath7 gev , superimposed on the smooth spectrum .",
    "we reproduce in fig . 1 their observations and a compilation of the results of other measurements",
    ". the spectral slope below @xmath8 gev progressively flattens to a slope of @xmath61.7 .",
    "uncertainties in the estimates of the interstellar fluxes are introduced due to solar modulation effects below an energy of a few gev .",
    "we also show , in the same figure , a smooth fit to all the data that we adopt for some of the calculations .    the electronic component in cosmic rays ,",
    "because of its interactions with radiation fields such as starlight , the microwave background , and magnetic fields in the galaxy , has been particularly useful in understanding the origins and propagation of energetic particles in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "this and other early considerations of the effects on the spectral shape of the cosmic ray electrons were carried out in the context of a smooth distribution of cosmic ray sources in the galaxy , and the transport was described within the framework of the leaky - box model @xcite . in its initial formulation",
    ", the cosmic ray residence time in the galaxy was assumed to be independent of energy for @xmath9 gev .",
    "however , improved measurements showed that the ratio of secondary nuclei to their parent primary nuclei decreased with increasing energy beyond @xmath10 gev .",
    "this observation naturally gave rise to the suggestion that the residence time of cosmic rays in the galaxy could indeed be energy dependent and decrease with increasing energy . according to this model",
    ", the anisotropy of the cosmic ray fluxes will correspondingly increase with energy and will exceed the observational bounds at very high energies . motivated by the need to alleviate this difficulty and by general considerations , the nested leaky - box model was proposed , which took into consideration the effects of storage of cosmic rays in a small bubble or cocoon surrounding the compact sources of cosmic rays ( cowsik & wilson 1973 , 1975 ) . eventhough the residence time of cosmic rays in the cocoon was energy dependent to generate the energy dependent part of the secondary to primary ratio of cosmic ray nuclei , subsequent to their leakage from the cocoon , the residence time of cosmic rays in the galaxy was assumed to be independant of energy .",
    "thus , the anisotropy remained sensibly constant up to very high energies , @xmath11 gev .",
    "we provide some details of this model later in this paper .",
    "the discrete nature of the sources of cosmic rays was addressed within the context of a diffusion model , and the implication to the electronic component was worked out @xcite to show that we need sources within a few hundred parsecs in order to reproduce the observed spectrum of electrons up to @xmath4 tev . here , the sources of cosmic rays were distributed randomly in a thin disk , and the diffusion region was a thick disk .",
    "the boundary condition was that the density of cosmic rays vanished at the upper and lower surfaces of the thick disk , signifying free escape .",
    "the need for the proximity of cosmic ray sources to explain the electron spectrum at high energies was reiterated by similar analyses by nishimura and others ( nishimura et al .",
    "1997 ; atoyan et al .",
    "1995 ) . in many of these papers , the complexities introduced by the boundary conditions on the two planes bounding the diffusion volume",
    "is avoided by assuming that the diffusion volume is of infinite thickness .    in this paper , we would also like to keep the green s function simpler than that provided by cowsik and lee ( 1979 ) , but we would like to still have the option of leakage of the particles from the galaxy .",
    "to this end , we include a term signifying simple leakage similar to that in the leaky - box model .",
    "the considerable success of this model in reproducing the energy spectra from the cosmic ray sources and the fact that the green s function integrates to the leaky - box model for a uniform distribution of sources surrounding the observation point justifies this approach .",
    "apart from the transparency with which the results reported are derived here , we also note that many of the results are indeed generic to any reasonable model of cosmic ray propagation .",
    "it may be noted that this model fits the cosmic ray observations such as the ratio of secondary to primary nuclei in the cosmic rays , the positron fraction , the upper bounds on anisotropy , and the total electron spectrum . whereas we refer our readers to the papers cited here ( cowsik et al .",
    "1967 ; cowsik & wilson 1973 , 1975 ) for the full details of the model , we provide here all the details needed for the discussion of the recent data on the electronic component .",
    "we show that the spectral slope of the electronic component at the highest energies will be dominated by secondaries generated by the nuclear component of cosmic rays through collisions with the interstellar matter .",
    "this is because as long as the cosmic ray sources are discrete , the electrons directly accelerated by them would be cut off sharply due to synchrotron radiation and the inverse compton effect at energies determined by the distance to the nearest source .",
    "the recent observations of positrons in cosmic rays by pamela @xcite has created much excitement because of the possible interpretation of these observations as annihilation of dark matter in the galaxy .",
    "their observations and the results from earlier measurements are compiled in fig .",
    "2 . even at the outset",
    ", it is worth pointing out that the positron fraction observed by pamela has a higher statistical significance and a similar energy dependence in comparison with the earlier measurements , but falls markedly lower over the entire energy band of the measurements .",
    "it appears difficult to ascribe the lower ratios observed by pamela to the effects of solar modulation , as they are seen even up to @xmath12 gev .",
    "the positron fraction at @xmath13 gev was measured by pamela to be @xmath14 , which decreases to @xmath15 at @xmath16 gev and thereupon increases monotonically , reaching a value of 0.137 at a mean energy of @xmath17 gev .",
    "it is this monotonic increase that is being called anomalous , as it does not conform to the prediction of the leaky - box model of the cosmic ray propagation with energy dependent residence time in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "accordingly , this paper begins with a review of the cosmic ray propagation models .",
    "the theoretical expectation that the positron fraction should level off or gently decrease with energy is specific to the assumption that the ratio of secondary to primary nuclei , like b / c , will continue to fall up to very high energies . in interpreting the positron fraction , it is important to note that there is a fundamental difference between kinematics of the generation of positrons and secondary nuclei by the interaction of primary cosmic ray nuclei ; whereas the secondary nuclei emerge from the collisions with nearly the same energy per nucleon as the primary nuclei that generate them , the positron produced through the interactions of cosmic ray nuclei carries away only a few percent of the energy per nucleon of the primary .",
    "this fact leads to the very interesting consequence that the secondary positron spectrum in the interstellar space has the same spectral slope as the primary nuclei in the context of the nested leaky - box model even though the ratio of secondary to primary nuclei , such as b / c , follows the observed decrease with energy .",
    "of central relevence to the discussion of the positron fraction is the spectrum of the cosmic ray nucleonic component that is dominated by protons with some neutrons coming in bound as he and other nuclei .",
    "the nucleon spectrum may be represented as f_n(e)=i_n e^-_nwhere @xmath18 ( we adopt @xmath19 . ) in the energy region @xmath20 gev / nucleon to @xmath21 gev / nucleon , beyond which the slope may increase to @xmath63 .",
    "the @xmath22 ratio effectively determines the @xmath23 ratio generated by cosmic rays via interactions with matter in the sources and the interstellar medium through which they propagate before they leak out of the galaxy .",
    "the theoretical calculation of @xmath23 generated through nuclear interactions of cosmic ray nuclei yield @xmath24 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the observations of the @xmath25 ratio @xcite in cosmic rays gives @xmath26 .",
    "in recent efforts to explain the positron fraction and the `` bump '' in the total electron spectrum observed by atic around @xmath7 gev , it has been suggested that astrophysical objects such as a nearby gamma ray burst source @xcite , one or more pulsars ( hooper et al .",
    "2008a ; kawanaka et al .",
    "2009 ; malyshev et al .",
    "2009 ; pohl 2008 ; profumo 2008 ; yksel et al .",
    "2008 ) , or a few nearby supernova remnants ( dado & dar 2009 ; fujita et al .",
    "2009 ; shaviv et al .",
    "2009 ) may be the cause of the `` anomaly '' .",
    "most of the recent effort has been in looking for a dark matter explanation for these observations .",
    "supersymmetric dark matter such as the neutralino may explain the excess in the observed total electron spectrum , but there may be a need for excessive clumping or an exceedingly local source ( hooper et al .",
    "2008b ; ishiwata et al .",
    "this clumping can be avoided if one considers kaluza - klein dark matter @xcite .",
    "an interesting dark matter explanation comes from the introduction of new force carriers @xcite which allows for a somerfeld enhancement and boosts the annihilation rate to leptons .",
    "the new particles may even be able to explain the annual modulation of the signal seen it the dama experiment @xcite .",
    "various other dark matter explanations have been formulated to explain the recent findings , and we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for more detailed lists of the recent studies .    in section 2 , we provide a brief overview of the models for cosmic ray propagation and in section 3 , we discuss the pamela results , first in a model independent way and then compare it with the expectations of the various models . in section 4 , we subtract the secondary positron and electron spectra from the spectrum of the total electronic component observed by fermi , hess , atic , and other experiments to obtain the spectrum of electrons arising exclusively due to input from various discrete sources of cosmic rays sprinkled over the galaxy .",
    "we then analyze this spectrum to derive the distance to the nearest source and the mean spacing between the cosmic ray sources in the galaxy . in section 5",
    ", we analyze the excess in the total electron spectrum by considering a @xmath27-function input spectrum and the spectrum expected from shock acceleration .",
    "finally , section 6 is devoted to a discussion of the main results of this paper and related matters .",
    "this paper is an extension of work presented at the 31st international cosmic ray conferece @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that cosmic rays are accelerated in a large number of discrete sources distributed in the galaxy , and the cosmic rays propagate from these sources moving along randomly oriented trajectories , akin to diffusion , until they leak away from the galaxy . during such a propagation",
    ", the cosmic rays might interact with matter surrounding the sources , interstellar matter , radiation , and magnetic fields .",
    "any secondaries generated through such interactions , if charged , will be confined by the interstellar magnetic fields and will therefore follow the same kind of random paths as the primaries before escaping from the galaxy .",
    "the various propagation models are characterized by the specific form chosen for the `` vacuum path length distribution '' @xcite which describes the probability @xmath28 that the cosmic rays spend in any given region , such as a cocoon surrounding the sources , or in the general interstellar medium before escaping into the intergalactic space .",
    "the term `` vacuum '' emphasizes the fact that in specifying @xmath28 , one considers hypothetical particles which do not suffer interactions or lose energy during propagation .",
    "the effects of these processes are to be computed based on the distribution of paths @xmath28 .      in its simplest original form @xcite",
    ", one assumes that @xmath28 has a broad distribution with significant amplitude near @xmath29 , exemplified by a simple exponential function p(t)=e^-t/ where @xmath30 is called the escape lifetime of the cosmic rays . in the original version ,",
    "@xmath30 was assumed to be sensibly independent of energy beyond @xmath31 gev .",
    "thereafter , since the discovery that the ratio of the fluxes of secondary cosmic rays to those of the primaries was a decreasing function of energy , @xmath30 was considered to decrease with energy to accommodate the observations .",
    "we summarize in fig . 3 and fig .",
    "4 the available observations .",
    "the crucial issue here is how @xmath30 behaves at energies beyond @xmath32 gev where the observations have low statistical significance or are non - existent at much higher energies .",
    "most conventional models today ( moskalenko & strong 1998 ; strong et al .",
    "2007 ) assume that [ eq : taua]model  a :  _ a(e)~_0e^- ,  e>2  gev / nwith @xmath33 .",
    "such an extrapolation to high energies is shown as a dotted line in fig . 3 and fig . 4 .",
    "to understand the spectra of the nuclear component in this model let the rate at which sources inject cosmic ray nuclei , say carbon , into the galactic volume , per unit volume , unit energy interval , and unit time be given by s_c(e ) = k_c e^-_c    assuming that the leakage from the galaxy dominates their loss , the equilibrium spectrum in the interstellar space is given by f_c(e ) = s_c(e)_a(e ) = k_c _ 0 e^-(_c + ) = i_c e^-_c in order to match the observed spectrum of carbon nuclei with @xmath34 , we should choose @xmath35 , i.e. a relatively flat injection spectrum",
    ".    now , secondary nuclei , like b , are generated at the same energy per nucleon as their progenitor c , at a rate s_b(e ) = cn_h_b , c(e ) f_c(e ) where @xmath36 is the density of target nucleon in the interstellar medium .",
    "the b production cross section @xmath37 is nearly independent of energy and s_b(e ) = k_b e^-_c where @xmath38 .",
    "the equilibrium sepctrum of b is given by f_b(e ) = s_b(e ) _ 0 e^- = k_b _ 0 e^-(_c + ) = c n_h _ b , c k_c _ 0 ^ 2 e^-(_c + 2 ) comparing this expression for @xmath39 with that for @xmath40 in equation 6 , one sees that @xmath41 ratio falls as @xmath42 . in other words ,",
    "the ratio of secondary nuclei to their primaries just follows the energy dependence of the leakage lifetime in the leaky - box model .",
    "it is worth noting that in this model the anisotropies in the cosmic ray fluxes increase as @xmath43 , becoming unacceptably large for @xmath44 gev .    in an attempt to overcome this difficulty we may assume that the residence time follows the energy dependence of the secondary to primary ratio , say up to @xmath45 gev and levels off theeafter to a constant value .",
    "that is , we may assume that @xmath46 becomes nearly constant at high energies model  b :  \\ {    ll _",

    "is shown as a solid line in fig . 3 and fig .",
    "the constancy of @xmath48 at high energies predicts a lower level of anisotropy of cosmic rays without any increase with energy .",
    "however , in this model the spectral slope of the primary nuclei , @xmath49 , for @xmath50 gev , and @xmath51 for @xmath52 gev .",
    "thus in order to match the constant value of @xmath53 , we will have to assume that @xmath54 for @xmath50 gev , and @xmath55 for @xmath56 gev .",
    "we will refer to the two models described briefly here as leaky - box model a and leaky - box model b respectively .",
    "an alternate way of accommodating the falling secondary to primary ratio is in the context of the nested leaky - box model ( cowsik & wilson 1973 , 1975 ) .",
    "here , one assumes that subsequent to acceleration , cosmic rays at lower energies spend some time in a cocoon - like region surrounding the sources , interacting with the matter there to generate some of the secondaries .",
    "the residence time @xmath57 in the source region is assumed to be energy dependent , decreasing with increasing energy . on the other hand , once these cosmic rays enter the general interstellar medium , their subsequent transport becomes independent of energy and the residence time becomes equal to @xmath47 .",
    "model  c :  \\ {    ll _ s(e)~_b(e)-_g &  1  gev < e<10  gev + _ s(e)~_g &  10  gev < e<10 ^ 6  gev    .the net effect of the interactions in these two regions is to generate the correct ratio of the fluxes of secondary nuclei to those of their primaries , as shown in fig",
    ". 3 and fig . 4 marked with labels c.    let the rate at which a cosmic ray source accelerates primary nuclei and injects them into a cocoon surrounding the source be represented as @xmath58 and given by s_n(e ) = q_n e^-_n the total number of cosmic rays within the cocoon is determined by the balance between the injection rate and the leakage characterized by the lifetime @xmath59 .",
    "f_n(e ) = s_n(e)_s(e ) = q_n e^-_n _ s(e).the nuclear component leaks out of the cocoon at a rate that is inversely proportional to the residence time @xmath60 .",
    "thus each source injects cosmic ray nuclei into the interstellar medium at a rate given by f_n(e ) / _ s(e ) = s_n(e ) = q_n e^-_n if the spatial number density of the cosmic ray sources is represented by @xmath61 , then the injection rate per unit volume is given by s_n(e ) = q_n e^-_n . note that this spectral exponent @xmath62 is identical to that of the input into the cocoons . in the above analysis",
    ", we have neglected the slight decrease in the value of @xmath63 due to nuclear interactions with the mateiral in the cocoon ; more exact expressions are available elsewhere ( cowsik and wilson 1973 , 1975 ) , which are also applicable to the rest of the discussions in this section .",
    "now , the leakage lifetime from the galaxy @xmath47 , in the nested leaky - box model , is independent of energy , and the equilibrium spectrum of primary nuclei @xmath64 in the galaxy is given by f_n(e ) = s_n(e)_g = q_n _ g e^-_n i_n e^-_n ,  i.e.   _ n = _ n note that this represents the spectral form intrinsic to the acceleration process .",
    "in constrast with this result for primary nuclei , note that the rate of generation of secondary nuclei within the cocoon , such as b , by the spallation of primary nuclei , such as c , is given by s_b(e ) = c n_h _ b , c f_c(e ) = c n_h _ b , c q_c _ s(e ) e^-_c this leads to a spectrum of secondary nuclei inside the cocoon @xmath65 given by f_b(e ) = s_b(e ) _",

    "this rate of injection is just due to the spallation taking place in the sources and reflects the energy dependence of @xmath60 superimposed on the primary spectrum @xmath66 .",
    "the spallation of primary nuclei in collision with interstellar matter also generates secondary nuclei at the rate s_b2(e ) = c n_h _ b , c f_c(e ) = c n_h _ b , c q_c _ g e^-_c these two injection processes for secondaries will lead to an equilibrium spectrum of secondary nuclei , @xmath39 , f_b(e ) = \\{s_b1(e ) + s_b2(e ) } _",
    "g = c _ b , c q_c _ g \\ { n_h _ s(e ) + n_h _ g } e^-_c .    as noted before , these remarks are made with the assumption that the production of the tertiary nuclei and higher order effects are small .",
    "however , it is straightforward to derive the exact expression in a more general case ( cowsik & wilson 1973 , 1975 ) .",
    "note that the expression \\{@xmath67 } in equation 21 has been chosen so as to reproduce the observed b / c ratio in cosmic rays .",
    "it is important to note that in model c , the spectrum of the primary nuclei as observed by various experiments has the same spectral index as that generated by the acceleration process , both being @xmath68 .",
    "the absence of significant anisotropy of cosmic rays at high energies is also easily understood .",
    "the residence time of cosmic rays in the galaxy is essentially constant up to @xmath69 tev .",
    "this will predict that anisotropy will not increase significantly with energy at least up to this energy .",
    "the generation of electrons and positrons in the interactions of the cosmic ray nuclear component occurs through the production of mesons , mainly pions , which decay to muons , which in turn decay into electrons or positrons , transferring , on the average , a fraction of about 0.05 of the energy per nucleon of the primary .",
    "this is in contrast with the production of secondary nuclei , such as boron from the collision of carbon nuclei , where boron emerges with almost the same energy per nucleon as the primary carbon nucleus .",
    "this difference in their production characteristics leads to nearly identical source spectra @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the secondary electrons and positrons @xmath72 in all the three models ( a , b , and c ) . to see this",
    ", we note that the rate of generation of secondary positrons and electrons at any energy e is proportional to the flux density of the nucleonic component at @xmath73 and the collision rate .",
    "thus in all the models ( a , b , and c ) the rate of production of positrons and electrons in the interstellar medium is given by s_n f_n(20e ) ~e^-_n    in considering the nested leaky - box model c , we should in principle add the generation of secondaries inside the cocoons .",
    "this rate is proportional to s_n c(e ) f_n(20e ) ~q_n e^-_n _ s(20e ) 0  e1  gev in writing equation 23 , we have used equation 13 to define @xmath74 and note from fig . 3 and fig .",
    "4 that @xmath75 becomes very small compared with @xmath76 for @xmath77 gev .",
    "thus the injection spectra of positions and electrons for @xmath78 gev are essentially the same in all the three models",
    ".    on the other hand , their equilibrium spectra @xmath79 and @xmath80 are markedly different in the three models . for energies below @xmath69 gev , where the energy losses due to synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering on radiation fields are not important",
    ", the three models generate the spectra noted below : @xmath81    the spectra for the electrons are similar to those given in equation 24 , except that because of the dominance of the protons in the cosmic ray beam , the production rate of electrons is somewhat lower , with = .this ratio @xmath82 is theoretically estimated from the characteristics of high energy interactions to be @xmath60.5 @xcite ; on the other hand , the direct observation of the @xmath83 ratio indicates a value of @xmath84 @xcite . in either case",
    ", @xmath82 is essentially independent of energy beyond a few gev .",
    "thus we see that , at high energies ( @xmath56 gev ) , in the leaky - box model b and in the nested leaky - box model c , the secondary positron and electron spectra are power laws with indices @xmath85 , i.e. equal to that of the spectrum of the nuclear component in cosmic rays . at very high energies ,",
    "the energy losses due to synchrotron emission and inverse compton scattering will steepen these spectra to @xmath86 .",
    "we will discuss this aspect further in section 4 .",
    "it is useful to write the observed positron fraction @xmath87 in terms of the various components : r(e)=.here , @xmath88 and @xmath89 represent the positron and electron spectra generated as secondaries of the nuclear component of cosmic rays , and @xmath90 is the spectrum of electrons resulting from direct acceleration in the sources .",
    "note that there is no direct acceleration of positrons in the source .",
    "it is convenient sometimes to work with the inverse of @xmath87 given by p(e)=== 1++.this allows one to find the spectrum of electrons generated by the sources @xmath90 as f_e^-(e)=[p(e)-(1+)]f_n^+(e).we show in fig .",
    "5 the net secondary spectrum @xmath91 calculated in model c , along with the spectrum of electrons resulting from direct acceleration in the sources , @xmath92 , which is obtained by simply substracting @xmath93 from each of the observed data points displayed in fig .",
    "1 . we also show in the same figure a solid line representing @xmath92 calculated using equation 28 and a smooth fit to the pamela observations ; this line and the data points in fig .",
    "5 represent the spectrum of electrons generated exclusively through acceleration in various cosmic ray sources in the galaxy .",
    "alternatively , we may just assume the functional form for @xmath79 given by the various propagation models and calculate the positron fraction by dividing @xmath79 by @xmath94 , the total spectrum of electrons measured by fermi , hess , and other experiments , r_m(e)=,which is shown in fig .",
    "[ pammodels ] along with the data from pamela and other experiments .",
    "the normalization of the theoretical curves is such as to provide the best possible fit to the three models a , b , and c described earlier .",
    "( this normalization may indeed be explicitly calculated as it is proportional to @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath47 respectively for the three models and depends on the density of matter in the propagation region , the spectral flux of the nuclear component , the cross section for meson production , decay kinematics , etc . ) in depicting the three model curves , we have included the effect of the radiative energy losses at high energies .",
    "comparison of the theoretical expectations of the positron fraction with the pamela data indicates that model a provides a rather poor fit to the observations , as already noted by several authors @xcite . a careful calculation of the positron fraction under the general assumptions of model a",
    "was carried out over a decade ago by moskalenko and strong ( 1998 ) .",
    "our estimates here are essentially the same as that derived by them .",
    "even though both model b and model c predict nearly identical injection spectra , the equilibrium spectra at low energies in these two models differ drastically with each other . on the other hand , both these models predict identical equilibrium spectra at high energies for @xmath56 gev .",
    "the good fit to observed the positron fraction shows that the residence time of cosmic rays is essentially independent of energy for @xmath97 gev , a constancy that is expected to continue up to @xmath98 gev .",
    "in choosing between model b and model c , the latter is preferred from considerations of the spectra of primary nuclei as well .",
    "this is because for a simple power law input from the sources having a form @xmath99 , model b would be expected to yield a spectral form @xmath100 below @xmath101 gev and @xmath102 at higher energies . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed spectra of all the primary nucleonic components are simple power laws of slope @xmath103 with no changes of slope in the tens of gev region .",
    "thus we conclude that the nested leaky - box model provides good fit with the pamela data and is preferred also from consideration of other cosmic ray observations .    in order to derive the behavior of the positron fraction at very high energies , beyond the pamela domain , we need to study the possible form of the spectrum of primary electrons generated by the cosmic ray sources , @xmath104 .",
    "the key point to keep in mind here is that there exists a discrete set of compact cosmic ray sources , which are distributed randomly over the galaxy .",
    "this discrete nature of the sources and its impact on the form of the electron spectrum from a source @xmath104 have been discussed earlier , notably by cowsik and lee ( 1979 ) and by nishimura et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . the diffuse flux from a transient source at a distance @xmath105 peaks at a time @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the diffusion constant .",
    "this finite time of propagation induces a sharp cutoff in @xmath104 at high energies due to radiative losses @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the source functions @xmath71 or @xmath70 , which correspond to the product of cosmic ray flux and the density of matter in the interstellar medium , have smooth spatial distributions , and accordingly , lead to a simple steepening of the spectrum to the form @xmath108 .",
    "thus , at the highest energies , the secondary component @xmath79 and @xmath80 will dominate over @xmath104 , the spectrum of electrons generated by the sources , so that r(e)~=0.6.thus we expect , on very general considerations , @xmath87 to increase at high energies and reach a plateau at a level of @xmath109 , which is dictated by the @xmath110 to @xmath111 ratio in the interstellar cosmic ray flux and by the nature of nuclear interactions at very high energies . based on the discussions in the section 4",
    ", we expect the positron ratio to reach the asymptotic value at @xmath112 tev .",
    "for the purposes of this discussion , we write down the transport equation for cosmic rays as [ eq : trans ] -^2n+=q where @xmath113 is the number density of cosmic ray particles at a distance @xmath105 from the source at time @xmath114 , @xmath107 is the diffusion constant , @xmath115 is the mean lifetime for the escape of particles from the galaxy ( taken to be independent of energy in the nested leaky - box model ) , and @xmath116 is the source term . setting @xmath117 , we get the green s function @xmath118 for the transport [ eq : transgreens ] g(r , t)=(4t)^-3/2exp\\{--}.note that in writing equation 31 , we have not included the term representing the energy loss for the electrons @xmath119 .",
    "this is because the energy loss due to synchrotron and compton processes takes away the energy of the electrons in small steps so that the energy loss may be treated as continuous without any stocasticity .",
    "this loss is customarily described by the equation [ eq : eloss]=-be^2or [ eq : elosstime ] t==where @xmath120 is the energy @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "thus , with the subsidiary condition given in equation 33 , the effect of energy loss may be completely taken into account ( cowsik & lee 1979 ) .",
    "we note also that for a uniform distribution of sources surrounding the observation point , this green s function leads to the leaky - box model , with an exponential `` path length distribution '' [ eq : leaky]p(t)=g(r , t)4r^2dr~e^-t/.    consider now a source located at a distance @xmath123 , which accelerates particles continuously to a spectrum of the form q_1(e ) = q_e e^-for  e < e_x.the spectrum that will be observed is given by [ eq : obsspect ] f_d(e , r_1)=^-_0 q_e e^-(1-bet)^-2 g(r_1,t)dt.the conceptual meaning of equation 37 is clear : equations 33 and 34 imply that the energy of the electron or positron at the instant of production , @xmath121 , is given by e(t=0)=and a unit bandwidth in energy at @xmath121 gets compressed to a bandwidth @xmath124 , enhancing the flux density per unit energy interval by this factor .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath125 coincides with @xmath126 , the maximum energy up to which the sources accelerate cosmic ray electrons .",
    "for the present purposes , we may take @xmath127 .    before we proceed further",
    ", we should fix the value of @xmath128 to be used . to this end",
    ", we note that for @xmath129 gev , the scattering cross section of the starlight by the electrons becomes small , as described by the kline - nishina formula .",
    "thus we need to consider the effects of the scattering only on the microwave background at 2.7 k and synchrotron radiation in the magnetic fields in the thick disk , which is the region of cosmic ray confinement .",
    "the value of @xmath128 is given by the formula @xmath130 we have taken @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "we start with a discussion of the spectra for a smooth distribution of sources such as that for the secondary positrons and electrons in model c ; their spectral shape is given by @xmath133 it is this form of @xmath134 that we adopted in the theoretical estimates for the secondary positron spectrum and positron fraction in section 2 .",
    "the contribution of secondary electrons and positrons @xmath135 to the observed spectrum of the total electronic component @xmath94 in cosmic rays is simply f_n^(e ) = f_n^+(e)+f_n^-(e)=(1+)f_n^+(e)where @xmath79 has the form @xmath136 given by equation 40 and is normalized to yield the correct positron fraction as described in section 2 . in order to obtain the spectrum of electrons generated exclusively by the cosmic ray sources , we need to subtract @xmath137 from the total observed spectrum f_e^-(e )",
    "= f_t(e)-f_n^(e).we show in fig .",
    "5 @xmath92 obtained by substracting @xmath137 from the data from atic , hess , fermi , and other experiments .    in order to understand the nature and the distribution of the sources of cosmic ray electrons , we first show in fig .",
    "7 the spectrum @xmath138 for various values of @xmath123 and a power law input with @xmath139 calculated using equation 37 .",
    "we note that these spectra are similar to those calculated by cowsik and lee ( 1979 ) , and they appear to fit the observations for @xmath140 pc .",
    "however , the spectrum @xmath92 has been generated by the inputs from an ensemble of discrete cosmic ray sources in the galaxy located at distances @xmath141 .",
    "assuming that the sources are randomly distributed with a mean spacing equal to the distance to the nearest source , the average distance to the @xmath142 source is r_1 where @xmath123 is the distance to the nearest source .",
    "the theoretical expectation for the equilibrium spectrum generated by the ensemble of cosmic ray sources for a power law input is given by [ eq : obsspectsum]f_d(e ) = _",
    "i=1^n f_d(e , r_i ) = _",
    "i=1^n_t=0 ^ 1/be ( 1-bet)^_s-2",
    "g(<r_i>,t)dtwhere n is the total number of sources which contribute to the local cosmic ray density .",
    "the spectrum @xmath143 has been calculated for various values of @xmath123 , and the results are displayed in fig .",
    "8 along with the spectrum @xmath92 estimated in equation 42 from the observations of fermi , hess , pamela and other experiments .",
    "we note that for the distance to the nearest source of @xmath144 pc , and for a typical separation of @xmath144 pc between the sources , the theoretical calculations match the observations reasonably well , except that they fall short of the intensities beyond a few hundred gev , leaving behind a narrow spectral feature centered around @xmath7 gev .",
    "this result , derived here more carefully and with better data , confirms the earlier analysis of cowsik and lee ( 1979 ) and nishimura et al .",
    "( 1997 ) that the spectrum of the cosmic ray electronic component at high energies shows that there are cosmic ray sources at distances of the order of @xmath69pc from the solar system and that the typical spacing between them is expected to be the same .",
    "the narrow spectral feature may be isolated by subtracting from the spectrum of the primary electrons @xmath92 , the expected spectrum @xmath143 due to power law inputs and diffusion from these sources : n_e(e)=f_e^-(e)-f_d(e ) this is displayed in fig .",
    "9 , and this excess or more specifically the sharp spectral features observed by atic , has been ascribed _ in toto _ or in part to products of dark matter annihilation , as mentioned in the introduction . in this section",
    ", we discuss this excess in terms of two input spectra , one a @xmath27-function in energy and the other a flat spectrum @xmath145 , such as that expected for acceleration at planar shocks of high mach number .",
    "the injection spectrum is assumed to be of the form q(t=0,e_a)=(e(t=0)-e_a),which could in principle represent the spectrum arising from annihilation of dark matter . without any leakage from the galaxy , such a spectrum will evolve as f_1(e , t)= ( -e_a ) .",
    "note that the above spectrum integrates over @xmath146 to unity for all values of @xmath114 .",
    "now , for a continuous injection and an energy independent leakage , the spectrum is given by f_c(e , e_a)=exp-().we display in fig .",
    "10 the spectrum calculated for @xmath147 gev for a spatially smooth distribution of sources and compare it with the narrow feature @xmath148 estimated in equation 45 . in fig .",
    "11 , we provide further examples of the theoretical spectra for various values of @xmath149 . note that @xmath150 is positive for @xmath151 and negative for @xmath152 .",
    "here , @xmath153 gev .",
    "thus , for a @xmath27-function input at @xmath154 gev , there is no peak in the observed spectrum at the energy value @xmath155 .",
    "therefore , the narrow feature seen at @xmath156 gev is unlikely to be generated by an input @xmath27-function source spatially extended and smoothly distributed about the solar system .",
    "incidentally note that if the value of @xmath128 is about a factor of two smaller than our estimate of @xmath157 gev@xmath158myr@xmath158 , we can get a broad peak at @xmath159 gev , but then the secondary component will extending into the hess region as shown in fig .",
    "5 ( dotted line ) .",
    "next we consider a @xmath27-function input from single discrete source located at various distances @xmath141 .",
    "this leads to an observed spectrum f_d(e , r_i)=()^3/2 exp-(+ ) .",
    "we display in fig 12 , several examples of @xmath160 for different values of @xmath141 .",
    "this spectrum displays a peak at e_peak.for small @xmath141 , this peak will be sharp near @xmath149 , but with increasing @xmath141 , this peak shifts to lower energies and becomes broader .",
    "as before , we sum over the sources at various distances to find their net contribution @xmath161 and show this in fig . 13 for different values of the mean spacing between the sources .",
    "such a composite spectrum is quite broad , with a very slight maximum around @xmath162 gev and does not provide a good fit to the feature at @xmath7 gev .",
    "acceleration of particles at planar shocks of high mach number generate spectra which are power laws of index @xmath163 q_shock(e)~q_0e^-2  for  e < e_x.the upper cutoff energy @xmath164 and the precise shape of the cutoff depends on the nature of the shock , radiative energy losses , and other such features .",
    "such an input leads to an equilibrium spectrum f_2(e)=(1-e^-).this is shown in fig .",
    "14 , and it appears to reproduce @xmath148 , the difference between the primary electron spectrum @xmath165 and that expected by a set of discrete cosmic ray sources @xmath166 .",
    "the main result that emerges from the present analysis is that the nested leaky - box model provides a good fit to the positron fraction observed by pamela .",
    "the model is also consistent with other observations of cosmic rays . until good measurements of the positron fraction",
    "were available , there was no easy means of choosing amongst various models .",
    "the fact that the nuclear secondaries , such as li , be , and b , emerge from nuclear interactions with essentially the same energy per nucleon as their parents , c , n , and o , was the main cause for this degeneracy .",
    "however , the fact that the positrons carry , on the average , a fraction of only about 0.05 of the energy per nucleon of their nuclear primaries breaks this degeneracy , allowing a choice to be made .",
    "improvements of the measurements of the spectra of both the secondary nuclei and of positrons will help in fixing , more firmly , the parameters of the nested leaky - box model . note that this model predicts that the @xmath167 ratio @xcite should nearly be constant at @xmath56 gev .",
    "also , the gamma rays generated by cosmic rays inside the cocoons through the @xmath168 process will have , on the average , a steep spectrum @xmath169 at @xmath170 gev . in closing",
    ", we note that as the centenary of the discovery of cosmic rays is approaching us , the field of cosmic ray studies is becoming more vibrant and is intimately getting connected with wider aspects of research in astrophysics .",
    "the recent measurements of the electronic component of cosmic rays by the pamela , hess , and fermi groups has opened up many interesting new avenues to discuss cosmic ray propagation . some of these were discussed or hinted at in this paper .",
    "further discussions will include an anysis of the @xmath167 ratio as seen by pamela @xcite .",
