    "this paper is concerned with the numerical study of the dynamics and blow - up issues for  weak \" dispersive perturbations of burgers ( inviscid ) equation . as in @xcite",
    "the motivation is to study the influence of dispersion on the dynamics of solutions to the cauchy problem for weak  dispersive perturbations of hyperbolic quasilinear equations or systems , as for instance the boussinesq systems for surface water waves .",
    "we thus want to investigate the competition between nonlinearity and dispersion .",
    "usually this problem is attacked by fixing the dispersion , _ eg _ that of the korteweg- de vries ( kdv ) equation and varying the nonlinearity @xmath0 in the generalized kdv ( gkdv ) equation    @xmath1    or the generalized benjamin - ono equation ( gbo ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the hilbert transform .",
    "the case @xmath5 is the @xmath6 critical case for the gbo equation .",
    "numerical simulations in @xcite are performed for @xmath7 suggesting finite time blow - up in this case . no rigorous proof of blowup",
    "is known for when @xmath3 though , contrary to the @xmath6 critical gkdv equation ( that is with @xmath8 for which a proof of existence of blowing - up solutions has been given in @xcite and revisited in @xcite .",
    "however it is probably more physically relevant to fix the quadratic nonlinearity ( _ eg _",
    "@xmath9 ) and to vary ( lower ) the dispersion .",
    "in fact in many problems arising from physics or continuum mechanics , the nonlinearity is quadratic , with terms like @xmath10 and the dispersion is in some sense weak . on the other hand ,",
    "dispersive terms occuring in the schrdinger or in the kdv equations are obtained by a taylor expansion of the true dispersion at a given wave number @xmath11 or in the long wave limit .",
    "this allows strong dispersive effects ( and nice mathematical properties ! ) , but restricts the range of frequencies for which the model is relevant .",
    "for instance the dispersion relation of the kdv equation is a bad approximation of the one of the water waves for not too small frequencies .",
    "we refer to @xcite for examples of water wave models with  full dispersion \" , that is models which share the same dispersion as that of the water waves system .",
    "in particular the original dispersion is not strong enough for yielding the dispersive estimates that allows to solve the cauchy problem in relatively large functional classes ( like the kdv or benjamin - ono equation in particular ) , down to the energy level for instance .    in fact",
    "many nonlinear dispersive systems have the following structure    @xmath12    where the order @xmath13 part @xmath14 is linear hyperbolic , @xmath15 being a linear ( not necessarily skew - adjoint ) dispersive operator and @xmath16 is a small parameter which measures the ( comparable ) nonlinear and dispersive effects . both the linear part and the dispersive part may involve nonlocal terms ( see _ eg _",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "boussinesq systems for surface water waves ( see @xcite ) are important examples of somewhat similar systems .",
    "note however that the boussinesq systems below can not be reduced exactly to the form except when @xmath17 otherwise the presence of a  bbm like \" term induces a smoothing effect on one or both nonlinear terms .",
    "they read    @xmath18    where @xmath19 are modelling constants satisfying the constraint @xmath20 and ad hoc conditions implying the well - posedness of the linearized system at the trivial solution @xmath21    when @xmath22 , the dispersion in is  weak \" ( the corresponding linear operator is of order @xmath23 or @xmath24 ( see @xcite ) contrary to the case @xmath25 @xmath26 when it is of order @xmath27 as in the kdv equation ) .    we will not address the blow - up issues for , which are completely open , but instead focus on one dimensional scalar equations .",
    "more precisely , the major question addressed here will be whether or not smooth solutions of the cauchy problem for weak dispersive perturbations of burgers equation develop singularities in finite time and if blow - up occurs , what is its nature : a shock like in solutions to burgers equation , a blow - up similar to the one of the @xmath6 critical or supercritical generalized kdv equations , or an  energy critical or super critical \" blow - up , a case that never occurs for the generalized kdv equations ( see below for a more detailed discussion ) .    we will also consider the _ long time existence _ issues , that is what is the qualitative behavior of the solution when it is global , or before the blow - up time if not ; in particular does it show a decomposition into solitary waves plus radiation ,    a typical behavior of solutions to integrable equations such as the kdv equation ? also when global existence is not assured , how does the presence of a  weak \" dispersive term affect the life span of the solution to the underlying burgers equation when a small parameter @xmath28 appears in front of the quadratic term and possibly in front of the dispersive terms ?",
    "the last question is particularly important for the complete rigorous justification of water waves models ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that except when the solution is global ( which can be proven essentially only for scalar one - way models ) the only long time existence results for water waves models such as the boussinesq systems are established on the  hyperbolic \" time scale @xmath29 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we will not address this issue in the context of relevant water waves models but again for the fractionary kdv or bbm ( fkdv or fbbm ) equations which will serve as toy models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we collect some analytically known facts about the equations to be studied numerically .",
    "the above questions will then be addressed for these equations numerically in section 3 .",
    "we add some concluding remarks in section 4 .",
    "the following notations will be used throughout this article .",
    "the fourier transform of a function @xmath30 will be denoted @xmath31 or @xmath32 for any @xmath33 we define @xmath34 by @xmath35    for @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the usual lebesgue space with the norm @xmath38 , and for @xmath39 , the sobolev space @xmath40 is defined via its usual norm @xmath41 .",
    "in this section we gather known facts about various dispersive regularizations of burgers equation . in particular we consider fractionary kdv and bbm equations . we formulate analytic questions which will then be addressed numerically in the following section .",
    "we will thus focus as a paradigm on one -dimensional model equations .",
    "a first one ( introduced by whitham @xcite ) is of kdv type with a weak dispersion .",
    "@xmath42 this equation can also be written in the form @xmath43 where the fourier multiplier operator @xmath44 is defined by @xmath45 with @xmath46    in the original whitham equation , the kernel @xmath47 was given by @xmath48 that is @xmath49 which corresponds to the phase velocity of purely gravitational waves .",
    "the whitham equation is also the one - dimensional version of the full dispersion kadomtsev - petviashvili equation ( fdkp ) studied in @xcite .",
    "when surface tension is added , the above @xmath50 has to be changed to @xmath51 where @xmath52 measures the surface tension effects .",
    "this leads to the extended whitham equation .",
    "we will consider here a family of equations where @xmath53 , that we call  fractionary kdv equations \" .",
    "the case @xmath54 corresponds to the usual kdv equation , @xmath55 to the benjamin - ono equation .",
    "it is well known ( see @xcite ) that for @xmath56 the solutions of the cauchy problem ( in appropriate functional spaces ) are global and therefore no finite time blow - up occurs . in the kdv case",
    ", it is known that the solution decomposes into solitons traveling to the right and radiation going to the left .",
    "the case @xmath57 is more delicate , and we will focus on it .",
    "when @xmath58 a blow - up occurs , that is there is a finite time blow - up of the solution of the cauchy problem corresponding to suitable smooth initial data ( see @xcite and@xcite for related equations ) .",
    "the proof in @xcite extends easily to the whitham equation ( see @xcite ) . by contradiction one",
    "proves that the @xmath59 norm of a solution blows up in finite time , but the proof does not indicate whether the gradient only or both the solution and its gradient blow up .",
    "our numerical simulations ( see section 3.5 ) suggest that only the gradient blows up .",
    "the occurrence of a possible blow - up when @xmath60 is an open problem .",
    "it is claimed in @xcite without proof that then a shock formation is not possible",
    ".    the situation appears anyhow very different from that of the _ fractal burgers equation _ that is the burgers equation perturbed by a fractionary dissipation term @xmath61 there ( see @xcite ) , a possible shock formation persists when @xmath62 .",
    "we briefly recall here the known results for the associated cauchy problem , that is    @xmath63    where @xmath64",
    "the following quantities are formally conserved by the flow associated to , @xmath65 and the hamiltonian @xmath66    note that by the sobolev embedding @xmath67 , @xmath68 is well - defined when @xmath69 but it does not make sense when @xmath70 the _ energy super critical case_.    moreover , equation is invariant under the scaling transformation @xmath71 for any positive number @xmath72 .",
    "a straightforward computation shows that @xmath73 , and thus the critical index corresponding to is @xmath74 . in particular",
    ", equation is @xmath6-critical for @xmath75 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath76 in the generalized kdv equation .",
    "compactness arguments ( see @xcite ) prove that admit global weak solutions ( without uniqueness ) in @xmath77 when @xmath78 for initial data in @xmath79(with a smallness condition when @xmath80 and , thanks to a kato type smoothing effect global weak solutions in @xmath81 see @xcite .    by using standard energy methods and the fact that the dispersive term is skew - adjoint ( thus without using explicitely the dispersion ) , one can on the other hand prove that the cauchy problem associated to is locally well - posed in @xmath40 for @xmath82 which is the same  hyperbolic type \" result as for the burgers equation .    taking into account the dispersion ,",
    "it has been established in @xcite that the cauchy problem for is locally well posed for initial data in @xmath83 for @xmath84 which does not allow to globalize the solution using the conservation laws .",
    "it is well known that the solitary waves play a significant role in the dynamics of the kdv equation and one can ask whether or not this is the case for the dispersive burgers equation",
    ".    a ( localized ) solitary wave solution of of the form @xmath85 must satisfy the equation @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "one does not expect solitary waves to exist when @xmath88 since then the hamiltonian does not make sense ( see a formal argument in @xcite and a rigorous proof in @xcite which also proves nonexistence of solitary waves when @xmath89 ) .",
    "on the other hand solitary waves exist when @xmath90 ( see @xcite ) and they have a slow decay for @xmath91 as @xmath92 they are expected to be orbitally stable when @xmath93 that is in the @xmath6 subcritical case ( this would correspond to @xmath94 for the generalized kdv equations ) .",
    "it is also worth noticing that solitary waves exist for the original whitham equation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the proof uses in a crucial way that the dispersion relation of the whitham equation approaches that of the kdv equation for small frequencies .",
    "existence of _ periodic _ traveling waves to the whitham equation has been proven in @xcite and their stability properties studied in @xcite and numerically in @xcite .",
    "note that the exponent @xmath95 corresponds to the so - called  energy critical case \" that never occurs for the generalized kdv equations where the energy ( hamiltonian ) always makes sense in the energy space @xmath96    at this stage , one could make the following conjectures for when @xmath60 :    * 1 . * no hyperbolic blow - up exists ( no blow - up of the spatial gradient with bounded sup - norm ) .",
    "when @xmath97 the solution is global ( no blow - up ) .",
    "* 3 . * when @xmath98 which is the @xmath6 supercritical case , one has a  nonlinear dispersive blow - up \" , with a kind of self - similar structure . this would correspond to @xmath99 for the generalized kdv equation . recall that this type of blow - up for is supported by numerical simulations in the super critical case @xmath100 ( @xcite , and in the critical case @xmath76 @xcite and rigorously proven in the critical case @xmath76 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the dynamics of the blow - up is different in the @xmath101-critical and in @xmath101-supercritical cases .",
    "when @xmath102 the energy critical case which has no counterpart for the generalized kdv equations , one expects a blow - up , but with a different structure of that of the previous case .",
    "we now turn to the bbm version of the dispersive burgers equation , namely    @xmath103    where the operator @xmath104 is defined as previously .",
    "the case @xmath105 corresponds to the classical bbm equation , @xmath106 to the bbm version of the benjamin - ono equation .",
    "a class of equations containing has been introduced in the appendix 1 of @xcite .    for any @xmath107 the energy @xmath108",
    "is formally conserved . by a standard compactness method",
    ", this implies that the cauchy problem for admits a global weak solution in @xmath109 for any initial data @xmath110 in @xmath111    one can also use the equivalent form    @xmath112    which gives the hamiltonian formulation    @xmath113    where the skew - adjoint operator @xmath114 is given by @xmath115 and @xmath116 note that the hamiltonian makes sense and is formally conserved for @xmath117 if and only if @xmath118    we will again focus on the case @xmath119 actually when @xmath120 is an ode in the sobolev space @xmath121 , @xmath122 and one obtains by standard arguments ( see @xcite ) the local well - posedness of the cauchy problem in @xmath121 , @xmath123 when @xmath55 ( the benjamin - ono bbm equation ) , the conservation of energy and an ode argument as in @xcite or the br ' ezis - gallout inequality implies that this local solution is in fact global .",
    "the following local well - posedness result is established in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath124 then the cauchy problem for or is locally well - posed for initial data in @xmath125    it is clear from the formulation that the fractionary bbm equation is for @xmath60 a different dispersive perturbation of the burgers equation of that given by the fractionary kdv equation : roughly speaking , one replaces the @xmath126 derivative of @xmath127 by a derivative of order @xmath128    the question is now : is there a blow - up when @xmath129 and if yes , what is its nature ?",
    "an important issue , when the solution is global , is to describe its qualitative behavior . in the range of fkdv equations ,",
    "the only fully understood case is @xmath130 the kdv equation where inverse scattering techniques yield a full description of the solution . for the other values of @xmath131 such a description",
    "is not known ( the only other integrable equation in the family corresponds to @xmath132 the benjamin - ono equation , but then inverse scattering techniques only work for small initial data ) .",
    "one aim of our numerical simulations is to investigate what happens when @xmath133 they actually suggest that a kind of _ decomposition into solitary waves plus radiation _ occurs , despite the fact that none of those equations are integrable .",
    "a similar behavior seems to hold for the fbbm equations , at least when @xmath134    another interesting and widely open question is to investigate the influence of a weak dispersion on the existence time of solutions to hyperbolic equations or systems ( see @xcite for some partial answers in the case of various water wave systems , in particular the boussinesq systems ) .",
    "again a simple relevant example is the dispersive burgers equation    @xmath135    where @xmath28 is a small positive parameter ( in the water waves context it could model the comparable effects of dispersion and nonlinearity ) .",
    "since the dispersive term in is skew - adjoint , one immediately deduces that for initial data @xmath136 of order @xmath24 in say @xmath137 the solution exists on time scales of order @xmath138    by changing the time variable as @xmath139 one eliminates the @xmath140 from , that is one obtains    @xmath141    and we have",
    "the following dichotomy :    @xmath142 either the solution to is global and so is that of ,    @xmath142 or the solution to has a lifespan of order @xmath143 and that of has a lifespan of order @xmath144 that is the same as for the burgers equation .",
    "our simulations below suggest that when @xmath145 the first situation occurs while when @xmath146 the second one holds .",
    "things are more delicate when the small parameter appears only in front of the nonlinear term as shows the striking example of the burgers - hilbert equation    @xmath147    where @xmath148 is the hilbert transform . it is established in @xcite that for initial data of order @xmath143 the solution of exists on time scales of order @xmath149 while the corresponding burgers solution exists on time scales of order @xmath138    one should thus consider the cauchy problem    @xmath150    an equivalent formulation ( by setting @xmath151 ) is to consider the cauchy problem    @xmath152    and the question is to see how the existence time @xmath153 is enlarged by the dispersive term @xmath154 in particular , is it possible to prove the existence of global small solutions to",
    "? this would give an example of initial data leading to a shock for the burgers equation and to a global solution for fkdv .",
    "of course similar questions can be addressed for the bbm version , that is    @xmath155    or    @xmath156    note that in one can not eliminate anymore the @xmath140 by a change of time scale because of the transport term .",
    "similar issues for the boussinesq systems are widely open . here",
    "( and for other relevant water waves models ) no existence results beyond the  hyperbolic \" time @xmath157 seem to be known ( see @xcite ) . recall that for the boussinesq systems , the error estimates with the full water waves system being @xmath158 ( see @xcite ) , and the solutions are expected to exist at least up to time scales of order @xmath159 there are here difficulties that are not present in the toy model fkdv or fbbm .",
    "first the change of time scale @xmath160 does not eliminate anymore the @xmath140 in the system because of the order zero hyperbolic part",
    ". moreover , as previously noticed , when @xmath161 and/or @xmath162 are strictly positive , the nonlinear term in the corresponding equation is smoothed by the operator @xmath163 ( resp . @xmath164    the case studied in @xcite ( that is @xmath165 ) is specially interesting since it was considered in those references as a perturbation of the ( hyperbolic ) saint - venant system .",
    "in this section we will study numerically solutions to fkdv , fbbm and whitham equations",
    ". the focus will be on smooth , localized initial data for which we study the decomposition into solitons and a possible blow - up in finite time .",
    "we also address the long time behavior of small initial data .",
    "first we will present the used numerical tools and discuss how accuracy is ensured .",
    "then we will study concrete examples .      since the equations to be studied in this paper contain fractionary derivatives being defined as fourier multipliers , it is convenient to use fourier spectral methods in the numerical treatment .",
    "we concentrate on rapidly decreasing , smooth initial data which can be analytically continued within the finite numerical precision as periodic functions .",
    "in other words , we use large enough computational domains that the fourier coefficients of the periodically continued initial data decrease to machine precision ( @xmath166 in our case ) .",
    "the fractional derivatives for fourier series are defined in analogy to the definition for fourier transforms .",
    "the discrete fourier transform is computed via a _ fast fourier transform _ ( fft ) .    the fkdv equation for the fourier transform @xmath167 of @xmath168 has the form @xmath169 where @xmath170 is a linear operator ) , the symbol @xmath171 is simply replaced with @xmath172 .",

    "this allows for an efficient integration in time .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that an implicit runge - kutta method of fourth order ( irk4 ) , a two - stage gauss scheme , is both very efficient and accurate up to blow - up for generalized kdv equations .",

    "the iteration converges rapidly ( at early times in 3 to 4 iterations ) .",

    "in this subsection we study the long time behavior of solutions to the fkdv ( [ cauchybis ] ) and fbbm equation ( [ bbmbis ] ) in the case of nonlinearity and dispersion of order @xmath28 for the initial data @xmath419 .    introducing the slow time variable @xmath452",
    "the fkdv case reduces to the standard fkdv equation    @xmath453    which implies the dichotomy : either the solution is global or the blow - up time scales like the break - up time as @xmath454 .",
    "the numerical study here will be therefore performed only as a test of the numerical approach .    alternatively , introducing the function @xmath455",
    ", we get the equations @xmath456 and @xmath457 both ( [ fkdvt ] ) and ( [ fbbmt ] ) will be solved for the initial data @xmath458 for several values of @xmath28 . for @xmath459 ,",
    "both equations reduce to the burgers equation . for the initial data @xmath460 , the solutions to the burgers equation",
    "have a point of gradient catastrophe , a hyperbolic blow - up , at the critical time @xmath461 obviously the critical time @xmath422 is of order @xmath29 .",
    "we will now study for several @xmath28 for examples , for which we observed blow - up in the previous sections , how the time @xmath223 scales with @xmath28 .",
    "we first consider fkdv with @xmath355 for the initial data @xmath462 for the values @xmath463 .",
    "since the blow - up is exponential , we just take the time for which the code stops converging as the blow - up time .",
    "this gives a very good approximation to @xmath223 , and what is important since we are interested in the @xmath28 dependence , a consistent one for all @xmath28 .",
    "the computation is carried out with @xmath315 fourier modes for @xmath464 $ ] and @xmath246 time steps . doing a linear regression analysis for @xmath465 , we find that the blow - up time @xmath223 is as the time @xmath422 ( [ tch ] ) of order @xmath29 . more precisely we get @xmath466 , @xmath467 with standard deviation @xmath468 and correlation coefficient @xmath469 .",
    "thus the expected dependence @xmath470 is numerically well observed .",
    "a corresponding analysis for fbbm is much more involved for two reasons : first the initial peak travels to the right before blowing up , the farther the smaller @xmath28 , whereas blow - up for fkdv happens close to the initial maximum . and",
    "secondly the blow - up is not as pronounced in fbbm as in fkdv for @xmath471 .",
    "thus it is less obvious to obtain an estimate for the blow - up time than for fkdv .",
    "the first problem is addressed as in ( [ resc ] ) and ( [ vx ] ) by using a frame commoving with the location of the maximum @xmath472 .",
    "thus we solve @xmath473 where @xmath474 to determine the blow - up time , we use the approach @xcite based on a fitting of the asymptotic behavior of the fourier coefficients .",
    "we again use the initial data @xmath475 for the values @xmath463 .",
    "the computation is carried out with @xmath476 fourier modes for @xmath477 $ ] and @xmath396 time steps . doing a linear regression as for fkdv , we find that the blow - up time @xmath223 is again as the time @xmath422 of order @xmath29 .",
    "more precisely we get @xmath478 , @xmath479 with standard deviation @xmath480 and correlation coefficient @xmath481 .",
    "thus we find again that the blow - up time @xmath223 is proportional to @xmath29 as the break - up time @xmath422 for the corresponding burgers solution .",
    "note that we always have @xmath421 .",
    "the above results therefore illustrates the fact that the life span of solutions of the burgers equation @xmath482 is not enhanced by a weak dispersive perturbation having the same small coefficient @xmath28 . on the other hand , as we have seen in the previous subsection",
    "the blow - up is of a different nature than the shock type one of the burgers equation .",
    "when the small parameter @xmath28 affects only the quadratic term in ( [ sanseps ] ) , we have already noticed that the resulting equation reduces to the standard fkdv equation with initial data of order @xmath28 and our simulations suggest that for any @xmath297 the solution is global for @xmath28 small enough .",
    "the numerical results in this paper suggest that blow - up in solutions to fkdv equations when @xmath483 is similar to blow - up in solutions to gkdv equations . in the @xmath484 critical case ( @xmath416 )",
    ", the blow - up profile appears to be given by a rescaled soliton . in the @xmath6 supercritical case @xmath302",
    ", the blow - up profile should be given by an asymptotically decreasing solution to the fractionary equation ( [ sautalpharinfty ] ) . to obtain further insight into this case , the asymptotics of solutions to this equation have to be worked out .",
    "it has to be shown whether there is a unique solution which is asymptotically decreasing .",
    "then a numerical scheme has to be developed to compare the blow - up in fkdv solutions to a rescaled form of this particular solution to ( [ sautalpharinfty ] ) .",
    "this will be subject of further work .",
    "another important question is related to the long - time behavior of solutions to fbbm equations for small nonlinearity as studied in the previous subsection",
    ". it would be worthwhile to investigate whether or not the found results persist in a more general context of dispersive perturbations of quasilinear hyperbolic systems and of course for relevant water waves models such as the boussinesq systems . in the latter case things",
    "might be more subtle since the presence of a  bbm \" term in the system weakens the nonlinearity in the corresponding equation .",
