    "the large number of particles produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions at the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) and the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) provide an opportunity to analyze and study , on an event - by - event basis , fluctuations in physical observables , such as particle multiplicities , transverse momenta , and their correlations .",
    "these studies provide information on the dynamics of multi - particle production and may help to reveal the phase transition from hadronic matter to quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite .",
    "the formation of hot and dense matter in high energy heavy - ion collisions also has the possibility to create matter in a chiral symmetry restored phase in the laboratory .",
    "after the initial stage of the collision , the system cools and expands returning to the normal qcd vacuum in which chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken . during this process , a metastable state may be formed in which the chiral condensate is disoriented from the true vacuum direction .",
    "this transient state would subsequently decay by emitting pions coherently within finite sub volumes or domains of the collision region .",
    "the possibility of formation of disoriented chiral condensate ( dcc ) has been discussed extensively in recent years @xcite .",
    "the detection and study of the dcc state would provide valuable information about the chiral phase transition and the vacuum structure of strong interactions .",
    "theoretical studies  @xcite suggest that isospin fluctuations caused by formation of a dcc would produce clusters of coherent pions in localized phase space domains .",
    "the formation of dcc domains would be associated with large event - by - event fluctuations in the ratio of neutral to charged pions .",
    "the probability distribution of the neutral pion fraction , @xmath1 , in such a dcc domain has been shown @xcite to follow the relation : @xmath2 which is quite different from that of the normal pion production mechanism .",
    "for the normal pion production , where the production of @xmath3,@xmath4 , @xmath5 are equally probable , the @xmath1 distribution is binomial peaking at @xmath6 .    in the experimental search for localized domains of dcc a practical approach is to search for events with large and localized fluctuations ( localized in pseudo - rapidity ( @xmath7 ) and azimuthal angle ( @xmath8 ) ) in the ratio of the number of photons to charged particles which would directly reflect fluctuations in the neutral to charged pion ratio .",
    "typical event structures would be similar to the centauro and anti - centauro events reported by the jacee collaboration @xcite .",
    "results from other cosmic ray experiments have not ruled out the possibility of the dcc formation mechanism @xcite .",
    "the accelerator based studies carried out in @xmath9 @xcite and heavy ion @xcite reactions have investigated particle production over extended regions of phase space .",
    "these analysis were not sensitive to the presence of small domains of dcc localized in phase space .",
    "a first search for evidence of localized domains of dcc has been carried out at the sps by the wa98 experiment in a detailed study of central pb+pb events  @xcite .",
    "the analysis showed the presence of localized non - statistical fluctuations in the multiplicity of both photons and charged particles .",
    "however , the charged - neutral fluctuations were found not to be correlated event - by - event , as would be expected for a dcc production mechanism .",
    "an upper limit on the frequency of dcc formation in central pb+pb collisions was set .",
    "recently there have been theoretical suggestions to look for dcc formation in events for intermediate centralities  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present first results on the centrality dependence of localized charged - neutral multiplicity fluctuations .",
    "it is based on an analysis of event - by - event fluctuation in the relative number of charged particles and photons detected within the common acceptance of the photon and charged particle multiplicity detectors of the wa98 experiment  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner : in the next section we describe the detectors used for the present analysis , the centrality selection criteria , the data reduction , and simulation . section  iii deals with the analysis techniques , where two analysis methods are presented , one based on the correlation of photons and charged particles , and the other based on a discrete wavelet transformation analysis . in section  iv , we present in detail the construction of mixed events used for this study .",
    "section  v discusses the ability of the mixed events to probe specific fluctuations .",
    "final results and discussion are given in section  vi .",
    "a summary is presented in section  vii .",
    "in the wa98 experiment at cern  @xcite , the main emphasis has been on high precision , simultaneous detection of both hadrons and photons . the experimental setup consisted of large acceptance hadron and photon spectrometers , detectors for charged particle and photon multiplicity measurements , and calorimeters for transverse and forward energy measurements .",
    "the present study makes use of the data from the photon multiplicity detector ( pmd ) , the silicon pad multiplicity detector ( spmd ) and the mid - rapidity calorimeter ( mirac ) .",
    "the centrality of the interaction was determined from the total transverse energy ( @xmath10 ) measured by the mid - rapidity calorimeter ( mirac )  @xcite .",
    "the mirac measures both the transverse electromagnetic ( @xmath11 ) and hadronic ( @xmath12 ) energies in the interval @xmath13 with a resolution of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , where @xmath16 is expressed in gev .",
    "the centrality , or impact parameter of the collision , has a strong correlation with the amount of @xmath10 produced . events with large @xmath10 production correspond to the most central , small impact parameter , collisions  @xcite .",
    "the centralities are expressed as fractions of the minimum bias cross section as a function of the measured total @xmath10 .",
    "for the present analysis we have used data selections in four centrality bins , the top @xmath17 ( henceforth referred to as centrality-1 ) , @xmath17 - @xmath18 ( centrality-2 ) , @xmath19 - @xmath20 ( centrality-3 ) , and @xmath21 ( centrality-4 ) of the minimum bias cross section .",
    "the minimum bias distribution of the total @xmath10 is shown in fig .",
    "[ et_cen ] .",
    "the centrality bins used in this analysis are marked in the figure .",
    "the photon multiplicity is measured using the preshower photon multiplicity detector ( pmd ) located at a distance of 21.5 meters from the target .",
    "the pmd consists of 3 radiation lengths ( @xmath22 ) thick lead converter plates in front of an array of square scintillator pads of four sizes , varying from 15 mm@xmath2315 mm to 25 mm@xmath2325 mm , placed in 28 box modules .",
    "each box module consists of a matrix of @xmath2450 scintillator pads read out using an image intensifier plus charged coupled device ( ccd ) camera system .",
    "the scintillation light is transmitted to the readout device via a short wavelength shifting fiber spliced to a long extra - mural absorber ( ema ) coated clear fiber .",
    "the total light amplification of the readout system is @xmath2540000 .",
    "digitization of the ccd pixel charge is done by a set of custom built fast - bus modules employing an 8 bit 20 mhz flash adc system .",
    "details of the design and characteristics of the pmd may be found in ref .",
    "the results presented here make use of the data from the central 22 box modules covering the pseudo - rapidity range of @xmath26 .",
    "the clusters of hit pads , having total adc content above a hadron rejection threshold are identified as photon - like , the multiplicity being denoted by @xmath27 . if the number of incident photons is denoted by @xmath28 and the number of photons detected above the hadron rejection threshold as @xmath29 , then the photon counting efficiency ( @xmath30 ) and purity of photon sample ( @xmath31 ) are defined as , @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "these are estimated from detector simulations  @xcite .",
    "the photon counting efficiencies for the central to peripheral cases varies from @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "the purity of the photon sample in the two cases varies from @xmath36 to @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the acceptance in terms of transverse momentum ( @xmath38 ) extends down to about @xmath39 , however the pmd energy resolution is not sufficient for particle - by - particle @xmath38 measurement .      the charged particle multiplicity ( @xmath40 ) is measured using the circular silicon pad multiplicity detector ( spmd ) located 32.8 cm from the target and having full azimuthal coverage in the region @xmath41 , corresponding to the central rapidity region at sps energies ( where @xmath42 ) .",
    "the detector consists of four overlapping quadrants , each fabricated from a single 300  @xmath43 thick silicon wafer .",
    "the active area of each quadrant is divided into 1012 pads forming 46 azimuthal wedges and 22 radial bins with a pad size increasing with radius to provide equal size pseudo - rapidity bins .",
    "the efficiency for detection of a charged particle in the active area has been determined in test beam measurements to be better than @xmath44 .",
    "conversely , the detector is transparent to high energy photons , since only about @xmath45 are expected to interact in the silicon . during the data recording , @xmath46 of the pads worked properly and are used in this analysis .",
    "details of the characteristics of the spmd can be found in ref .",
    "the spmd does not provide @xmath38 measurement , but provides the multiplicity measurement integrated over transverse momentum ( @xmath38 ) with a threshold which extends down to about @xmath47 .",
    "the data presented here were taken during december 1996 at the cern sps with the 158@xmath0  gev pb ion beam on a pb target of thickness 213  @xmath48 m .",
    "the wa98 goliath magnet was switched off during these runs .",
    "events with beam pile - up , downstream interactions , and pile - up in the ccd camera system were rejected in the off - line analysis  @xcite .",
    "the data have been analyzed for the region of common @xmath7 ( @xmath49 ) and @xmath8 coverage of the spmd charged particle and pmd photon multiplicity detectors .",
    "the @xmath27 and the @xmath40 distributions for the four centrality bins are shown in figs .",
    "[ ngam_cen ] and [ nch_cen ] .",
    "the number of events analyzed , the mean number of photons and charged particles along with the root mean square deviations are shown in the figures .",
    "the pmd and spmd detectors provide momentum integrated multiplicity measurements with very low thresholds .",
    "since pions from dcc domains are expected to have small @xmath50 values , below the pion mass , the momentum integration will dilute the dcc signal",
    ". on the other hand , the large coverage of the pmd and spmd are important to overcome the limitations of small number fluctuations .",
    "the various sources of systematic errors associated with the @xmath27 and @xmath40 distributions have been investigated and described in detail previously  @xcite .",
    "these include :    * \\(a ) the uncertainty in the energy calibration and the associated uncertainty in the energy threshold for hadron rejection in the pmd leads to an error in the efficiency for @xmath27 clusters .",
    "the nominal hadron rejection threshold was set at three times the minimum ionizing particle ( mip ) peak .",
    "the value of the threshold was reduced by @xmath18  @xcite in order to estimate the systematic error .",
    "the associated error in @xmath27 is @xmath51 . *",
    "\\(b ) the error due to the effect of clustering of pad signals in the pmd is a major source of error in @xmath27 .",
    "this error is determined from geant  @xcite simulation by comparing the number of known photon tracks on the pmd with the total number of reconstructed photon - like clusters .",
    "it is found that the number of clusters exceeds the number of tracks by @xmath52 in the case of peripheral events and by @xmath53 for high multiplicity central events . *",
    "\\(c ) the error due to the variation in pad - to - pad gains of the scintillators in pmd was found to be less than @xmath54 . *",
    "\\(d ) the uncertainty in the @xmath40 determination with the spmd has been estimated to be about @xmath55 @xcite . *",
    "\\(e ) the error due to the finite resolution in the measurement of the total transverse energy(@xmath56 ) in mirac @xcite translates into an uncertainty in the centrality selection .",
    "the effect of this systematic error has been determined by performing the analysis with varying centrality cut within the mirac resolution .",
    "the contribution of each of these various systematic errors to the final results are discussed in the following sections .",
    "simulated events were generated using the venus 4.12 event generator  @xcite with the default parameter values .",
    "the output was processed through a detector simulation package in the geant 3.21 @xcite framework .",
    "this simulation includes the full wa98 experimental setup and includes experimental effects such as photon conversions , downstream interactions , hadron backgrounds in the pmd , etc . which might dilute or enhance the observed fluctuations .",
    "the effect of landau fluctuations in the energy loss of charged particles in silicon was included in the spmd simulation @xcite .",
    "for the pmd simulation , the geant results in terms of energy deposition in pads were converted to the pad adc values using the mev - adc calibration relation .",
    "after this the adc distribution is convoluted with a gaussian function of proper width taken from the readout resolution curve . if the energy deposition is less than 3 mip , a landau distribution is used for convolution .",
    "the details of the pmd simulations taking into account the detector and readout effects can be found in ref .",
    "the centrality selection with the simulated data has been made in an identical manner to the data , determined from the simulated total transverse energy in mirac .",
    "the minimum bias total @xmath10 distribution predicted by venus is shown by the dashed histogram in fig .",
    "[ et_cen ] .",
    "the agreement with the data is seen to be quite reasonable .",
    "a total of 60k venus events with simulated detector response were generated for the present study .",
    "these simulated events ( henceforth referred to simply as venus events unless otherwise specified ) were then processed with the same analysis codes as used for the analysis of the experimental data .",
    "two different analysis methods have been used in the present study . in the first analysis method ,",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath27 versus @xmath40 multiplicity fluctuations is obtained in decreasing phase space regions .",
    "the second method employed the discrete wavelet transformation technique to investigate the relative magnitude of the @xmath27 versus @xmath40 fluctuations in adjacent phase space regions .",
    "the results from these methods of analysis applied to data , venus and various sets of mixed events ( to be discussed later ) are compared to draw proper conclusions .      in order to search for localized fluctuations in the photon and charged particle multiplicities , which may have non - statistical origin ,",
    "the correlation between @xmath27 and @xmath40 is investigated at various scales in @xmath8 .",
    "the event - by - event correlation between @xmath27 and @xmath40 has been studied in various @xmath8-intervals by dividing the entire @xmath8-space into 2 , 4 , 8 , and 16 bins .",
    "the method of analysis is similar to that described in refs .",
    "[ ngam_nch_cor ] shows scatter plot of the correlation between @xmath27 and @xmath40 for the top centrality bin .",
    "the correlation plots for each @xmath8 interval size , including the case of the full interval with no segmentation , are shown .",
    "the distributions for the other three centrality bins are qualitatively similar .",
    "a common correlation axis ( @xmath58 ) has been obtained for the full distribution by fitting the @xmath27 and @xmath40 correlation with a second order polynomial .",
    "the correlation axis with fit parameters is shown in the figure .",
    "the distance of separation ( @xmath59 ) between a data point and the correlation axis has been calculated with the convention that @xmath59 is positive for points below the @xmath58-axis .",
    "the distribution of @xmath60 represents the relative fluctuations of @xmath27 and @xmath40 from the correlation axis for any chosen @xmath8 bin size . in order to compare the fluctuations for different @xmath8 bins on a similar footing , a scaled variable , @xmath61 ,",
    "is used where @xmath62 represents the rms deviation of the @xmath59 distribution for venus events analyzed in the same manner .",
    "the @xmath60 distributions of data , mixed events and the simulated events for a given centrality and @xmath8 bin size are all scaled by the same @xmath62 corresponding to the venus events for the respective centrality and azimuthal bin size .",
    "the presence of events with localized fluctuations in @xmath27 and @xmath40 , at a given @xmath8 bin , is expected to result in a broader distribution of @xmath63 compared to those for normal events .",
    "comparing the rms deviations of the @xmath63 distributions of data , mixed events ( to be discussed later ) , and venus events may allow to infer the presence of non - statistical localized fluctuations .      a multi - resolution analysis using discrete wavelet transformations ( dwt ) @xcite has been shown to be quite powerful in the search for localized domains of dcc @xcite .",
    "the beauty of the dwt technique lies in its power to analyze a spectrum at different resolutions with the ability to identify fluctuations present at any scale .",
    "this method has been utilized very successfully in many fields including image processing , data compression , turbulence , human vision , radar , and earthquake prediction @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the dwt analysis provides different information than the moment analysis of the previous section .",
    "it analyzes the event - by - event distribution in phi space to characterize the bin - to - bin fluctuations relative to the average behaviour .    for the present dwt analysis the full azimuthal region",
    "is divided into smaller bins in @xmath8 , the number of bins at a given scale @xmath64 being @xmath65 .",
    "the input to the analysis is a spectrum of the sample function at the smallest bin in @xmath8 corresponding to the highest resolution scale , @xmath66 . in the present case",
    "the sample function is chosen to be the photon fraction , given by :    @xmath67    a multi - resolution analysis has been carried out using the @xmath684 wavelet basis on the above sample function starting with @xmath69 .",
    "it may be mentioned that there are several families of wavelet bases distinguished by the number of coefficients and the level of iteration ; we have used the frequently employed @xmath684 wavelet basis @xcite .",
    "the output of the dwt consists of a set of wavelet or father function coefficients ( ffc ) at each scale , from @xmath70, ... ,(@xmath71 ) .",
    "the coefficients obtained at a given scale , @xmath64 , are derived from the distribution of the sample function at one higher scale , @xmath72 .",
    "the ffcs quantify the bin - to - bin fluctuations in the sample function at that higher scale relative to the average behaviour .",
    "the presence of localized non - statistical fluctuations will increase the rms deviation of the distribution of ffcs and may result in non - gaussian tails @xcite .",
    "the dwt technique as used in this analysis has been demonstrated in our earlier publication  @xcite .",
    "once again , comparing the rms deviations of the ffc distributions of data , mixed events , and venus events may allow to infer the presence of localized fluctuations .",
    "the utility of the mixed events and the response of the analysis technique is demonstrated in section  v.",
    "it is possible to search for non - statistical fluctuations in the experimental data in a model independent way by comparison of the data with mixed events generated from the data itself .",
    "furthermore , it is necessary to isolate the various contributions to the fluctuations and to understand all detector related effects in the data .",
    "this has been done by generating different types of mixed events which preserve the global multiplicity correlation between @xmath27 and @xmath40 .",
    "fluctuations in the ratio of @xmath73 to @xmath40 can arise due to fluctuations in @xmath73 only , fluctuations in @xmath40 only , or fluctuation in both @xmath73 and @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , the fluctuations in @xmath73 and @xmath40 may be correlated event - by - event , as nominally expected in the case of dcc formation .",
    "each of these possibilities is investigated through the construction of four different kinds of mixed events .",
    "the method of construction of these mixed events and the type of fluctuations they probe are described next .",
    "the first set of mixed events , referred to as m1 events , are constructed to remove all correlations to the greatest extent possible to provide a baseline for comparison to the real event data .",
    "they were generated by mixing hits in both the photon and charged particle detectors separately but still satisfying the global @xmath27-@xmath40 correlation of the real event in the full acceptance .",
    "this means that on an event - by - event basis the total photon multiplicity and charged particle multiplicity of the mixed event were identical to those of the real event to which it corresponds .",
    "thus , the scatter plot of the mixed events is identical to the real events for the single bin case shown in fig .",
    "[ ngam_nch_cor ] .",
    "the idea is to constrain the mixed events to be identical to real events globally and then compare them to the real data in localized regions of phase space to search for indications of non - statistical localized fluctuations in the data .",
    "the m1 type of mixed events were constructed from the pool of all photon - like and charged particle hits , in which the hit position ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) and event information ( event number and total multiplicity ) was kept for both the photon - like and charged particle hits . for a given real event measured to have multiplicities @xmath27 and @xmath40 in the full acceptance region ,",
    "a mixed event was constructed by randomly selecting @xmath27 photon - like hits from the pool of photon - like hits and @xmath40 charged particle hits from the pool of charged particle hits .",
    "this procedure was repeated for each real event .",
    "care was taken such that no two hits from the same real event were used in the construction of a mixed event .",
    "also , for the mixed events , hits within either the spmd or pmd detector were not allowed to lie within the two - track resolution of that detector . in brief , the m1 mixed events randomly distribute the hits in each individual detector but keep the global correlation between the @xmath27 and @xmath40 multiplicity .",
    "they provide a maximally randomized sample of pmd and spmd hits .",
    "comparisons of such mixed events to real events will be most sensitive to the presence of localized fluctuations .",
    "however , in themselves they would not isolate the source of fluctuations as being due to @xmath73 and/or @xmath40 , or correlations between @xmath73 and @xmath40 .",
    "a second type of mixed events , referred to as m2 mixed events , were constructed to investigate the presence of correlated event - by - event fluctuations between @xmath73 and @xmath40 .",
    "these mixed events had a minimal amount of randomization since they were generated by mixing the photon hits taken unaltered from one event with the charged particle hits taken unmodified from another event .",
    "as with the m1 mixed events , the global @xmath27-@xmath40 multiplicity correlation was maintained to be exactly the same as the data .",
    "to construct such mixed events , for a given real event measured to have multiplicities @xmath27 and @xmath40 in the full acceptance region , a mixed event was constructed by keeping the pmd @xmath27 portion of the event intact , but combining it with the unaltered spmd portion of a different randomly selected event , but constrained to have almost the same charged particle multiplicity @xmath40 .",
    "this procedure was repeated for each real event . in brief",
    ", this type of mixed event keeps the event - by - event hit structure in each detector identical to that in real events .",
    "thus , such mixed events keep the individual localized fluctuations present in @xmath73 or @xmath40 , but remove the event - by - event localized correlated fluctuations between them .",
    "comparison of such mixed events to real events may reveal the presence of correlated localized fluctuations between @xmath73 and @xmath40 .",
    "intermediate between the m1 and m2 types of mixed events are a third and fourth type of partially mixed event , referred to as m3-@xmath74 and m3-@xmath75 mixed events .",
    "these were constructed to provide information regarding the contribution to the localized fluctuations in the @xmath73 to @xmath40 ratio from the individual observables ( @xmath73 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "they were generated from real events by mixing hits in one of the detectors ( following the procedure for construction of m1 mixed events ) and keeping the hit structure of the event in the other detector intact .",
    "m3-@xmath74 mixed events correspond to the case where the hits within the photon detector are unaltered while the hits in the charged particle detector are mixed .",
    "similarly in m3-@xmath76 mixed events the hits in the charged particle detector were unaltered and the hits in the photon detector were mixed . in each type of mixed event",
    "the global @xmath27@xmath40 correlation is maintained as in the real event .",
    "the two track resolution in the detectors where the hits are mixed is kept identical to that in real events .",
    "the total number of mixed events is the same as the number of real events .",
    "comparison of such mixed events to real events and the other types of mixed events will reveal the presence of localized fluctuations in @xmath73 or @xmath40 separately .",
    "a summary of the different sources of fluctuations in the ratio of @xmath73 to @xmath40 probed by each of the types of mixed events is given in table  1 .",
    ".[tab : table1 ] type of fluctuations preserved by various mixed events [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this section we wish to demonstrate the analysis method and illustrate how the relationship of the measured result to that obtained with the various mixed events can be used to provide an essentially model - independent signature of dcc formation . to demonstrate the analysis method and the potential to observe dcc event formation , we have applied the dwt analysis to a simple dcc - like model .",
    "the analysis is applied to `` real '' dcc events from the model as well as the various types of mixed events described in the previous section constructed from the model dcc events . since event generators which include dcc formation",
    "do not exist , we have implemented a simple dcc model in which localized non - statistical @xmath73-@xmath77 fluctuations have been introduced by modification of the output of the venus event generator . to implement the fluctuations , the final state pions within a localized @xmath7@xmath8 region from venus are interchanged pairwise ( @xmath78 ) according to the dcc probability distribution , @xmath79 .",
    "the fluctuations were generated over a localized region of @xmath80 and a @xmath81 interval of @xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath3 s were then allowed to decay .",
    "the resulting events were then passed through the wa98 detector response simulation .",
    "the dcc events in the simple model used here give rise to an anti - correlation between @xmath73 and @xmath83 .",
    "it also results in non - random fluctuations in both @xmath73 and @xmath83 individually .",
    "since the probability to produce events with localized charged - neutral fluctuations is unknown , ensembles of events , here referred to as `` ndcc events '' , were produced as a mixture of normal venus events and events with localized fluctuations .",
    "the fraction of events with localized dcc - like fluctuations in each ndcc sample was varied as a parameter to be studied .    by using venus events as the basis to introduce the dcc effect ,",
    "it is insured that the general features of the event , including the multiplicity , composition , and momenta of the produced particles , as well as correlations in the particle multiplicities due to impact parameter variation , are reasonably well described .",
    "also the geant simulation of the detector response to these events insures that other effects such as photon conversions and the response of the pmd to hadrons , which might affect the observed multiplicities and the observed correlations , are also taken into account . while the assumption of a 100% dcc contribution over an interval of fixed size in @xmath84 is certainly a gross simplification , it provides a well - defined reference to gauge the potential for dcc observation .",
    "other assumptions , such as a varying fraction , which might also be momentum dependent ( since dccs are expected to be a low p@xmath85 phenomena ) , and different or varying sizes might be more realistic .",
    "however , without clear theoretical guidance we have chosen this very simple model as a reasonable and well - defined reference .",
    "the dwt analysis was carried out on an ensemble of ndcc events and their corresponding mixed event sets created from each set of ndcc events . by ensemble of ndcc events",
    "we mean sets of events having different percentages of events with localized fluctuations .",
    "the percentage varied from zero , that is , normal venus events with no localized fluctuations , to an event set where all events had localized charged - neutral fluctuations . for every ndcc event set the four sets of mixed events ( m1,m2 , m3-@xmath74 , and m3-ch ) were constructed from the ndcc events and analyzed .",
    "the rms deviations of the ffc distributions for each set of ndcc events and corresponding mixed event sets were obtained .",
    "the results for scale @xmath70 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ rms ] as a function of the percentage of localized dcc - type events in the ndcc event set .",
    "it is seen that the rms deviations of the ffc distributions of the ndcc events increase as the percentage of events with localized fluctuations in @xmath73-@xmath83 increases .",
    "this is the expected behaviour and demonstrates the linear response of the dwt to the dcc events when the frequency of events with fluctuations increases . on the other hand , the rms deviations of the ffc distributions of the m1 type mixed events created from the ndcc events",
    "are found to be independent of the percentage of events having localized fluctuations .",
    "this is also the expected behaviour and demonstrates that the m1 mixed events can be used as a baseline from which to deduce the presence of fluctuations in a model - independent manner .",
    "however , the deviation of the real events from the m1 mixed events does not inform about the relative contributions of the individual @xmath73 and @xmath83 fluctuations .",
    "the rms deviations of the ffc distributions of the m3 mixed events are found to be intermediate to those obtained for ndcc events and m1 mixed events .",
    "they indicate the separate contributions of the @xmath73 or @xmath83 fluctuations alone to the ratio .",
    "the rms deviations of the m2 mixed events are higher than those of m1 and m3 mixed events .",
    "that is because the m2 mixed events keep the separate contributions of both the @xmath73 and @xmath83 fluctuations .",
    "however , the rms deviations of the m2 mixed events are consistently below those for the ndcc events .",

    "@xcite , care has been taken during the data taking and during the data processing to closely monitor the performance of the pmd and spmd .",
    "the detector uniformity of the pmd was studied in detail by using the minimum ionizing particle ( mip ) signal from the data for all pads of the 22 boxes .",
    "the fluctuations of the pad - to - pad relative gains were approximately 10@xmath91 .",

    "corrections for gain variations during the data taking period were made periodically for both the pmd and spmd .",
    "this reduces the possibility of abrupt gain or threshold changes during the run period .",
    "events with obvious detector readout effects , such as missing or dead regions , were carefully removed from the data sample . it should be recalled that most detector effects are reflected in the mixed events .",
    "the effect of local fluctuations in the performance of the pmd has been studied using simulated venus events . in one test , the gain of a group of pads corresponding to one or more pmd cameras was randomly varied .",
    "a 30@xmath91 change of gain in one camera for all events resulted in an increase of 0.7@xmath91 in the rms deviations . changing the gains of three cameras by 30@xmath91 for all events resulted in an increase of the rms deviations by 1.7@xmath91 . because the camera gains were closely monitored on - line and during the processing of the data this",
    "is considered to be a highly unlikely scenario . still , these changes are within the quoted errors of figs .",
    "[ sz_rms ]  and   [ ffc_rms ] which indicates that local gain and threshold variations would not account for the observed differences between the data and the m1 mixed events .",
    "several checks were performed to verify the quality of the data obtained with the spmd .",
    "one of the differences between the previous analysis  @xcite and the present one is that , while in the previous case the analysis was performed using the total charged particle multiplicity of the detector deduced from the magnitude of the measured spmd signals , here we simply used the total number of hit spmd pads .",
    "the reason for using hit pads is that the correction in going from deposited charge to hits for each event and small @xmath7@xmath8 segments is non - trivial .",
    "also , the effects of two - track resolution and possible shifts of the beam position on the target during the spill were studied in detail .",
    "however all of these produced small effects which could not account for the differences observed between the data and m1 mixed events .      in order to quantify the strength of the @xmath27 and @xmath40 fluctuations for various bins in @xmath8 and for different centrality classes , we define a quantity @xmath92 as :    @xmath93    where @xmath94 and @xmath95 correspond to the rms deviations of the ffc distributions of the m1 mixed events and real data , respectively .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ xi ] as a function of the number of bins in @xmath8 for the four different centrality classes .",
    "qualitatively similar results are obtained when @xmath92 is calculated using the rms deviations of the @xmath86 distributions .",
    "the shaded portion indicates the region of @xmath92 where @xmath95 is one @xmath96 greater than the rms deviation ffc distributions for m1 events , where @xmath96 is the total error on the m1 event rms deviation .",
    "it represents the limit above which a signal is detectable .",
    "since @xmath92 is calculated from the rms deviations of the ffc distributions for data and m1 mixed events it gives the combined strength of localized fluctuations in both the photon and charged particle multiplicities .",
    "we do not present @xmath92 values calculated using m3-type mixed events .",
    "however , it is clear from the rms deviation figures ( fig .  [ sz_rms ] and [ ffc_rms ] )",
    "that both photons and charged particles contribute to the observed fluctuations .",
    "the result shows that the strength of the fluctuations decreases as the number of bins in @xmath8 increases , with a strength which decreases to below detectable level ( within the quoted errors ) for 16 and 32 bins .",
    "there is an indication that the strength of the signal decreases with decreasing centrality for 4 and 8 bins in azimuthal angle , although the tendency is not very strong .",
    "it has been shown that the rms deviations of the @xmath86 and ffc distributions for data are very close to those of the m2 mixed events , within the quoted errors . if the dcc - like correlated fluctuations in @xmath27 @xmath89 @xmath40 were large , the rms deviations ( fig .  [ sz_rms ] and fig .",
    "[ ffc_rms ] ) of data would have been larger compared to those of the m2 mixed events .",

    "the larger of the asymmetric errors is conservatively used for the limit calculation .",
    "the @xmath97 c.l upper limit contour has been calculated as @xmath92 + 1.28@xmath98 , where @xmath92 is calculated using eq.([chi_eqn ] ) . here",
    "@xmath94 and @xmath95 correspond to the rms deviations of the ffc ( or @xmath86 ) distributions for m2 mixed events and real data , respectively , and @xmath98 is the error in @xmath92 from the ffc ( or @xmath86 ) analysis . if the difference between the rms deviation of the ffc distributions for m2 mixed events and real data is negative , we take the value of @xmath92 to be zero .",
    "it may be mentioned that for the calculation of the upper limits we have assumed that the total difference in the rms values of data and m2 mixed events is due to dcc - like fluctuations only .",
    "to relate the measured upper limit on the size of the fluctuations to a limit on dcc domain size and frequency of occurrence we proceed as follows : within the context of the simple simulated dcc model described earlier , we obtain the rms deviations of the ffc distributions with various domain sizes in azimuthal angle ( @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 @xmath102 ) and for each domain size also for different frequency of occurrence of dcc ( @xmath103 to @xmath104 ) .",
