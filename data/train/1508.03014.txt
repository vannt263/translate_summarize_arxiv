    "a spatial theta graph is _ brunnian _ ( or _ almost unknotted _ or _ minimally knotted _ ) if it is non - trivial and has the brunnian property .",
    "by far the best known brunnian theta graph is the kinoshita graph @xcite .",
    "the kinoshita graph was generalized by wolcott @xcite to a family of brunnian theta graphs now called the kinoshita - wolcott graphs .",
    "they are pictured in figure [ kinoshita - wolcott ] .",
    "inspection shows that they have the brunnian property .",
    "there are several approaches to showing that the kinoshita graph ( and perhaps all of the kinoshita - wolcott graphs ) are non - trivial : wolcott @xcite uses double branched covers ; litherland @xcite uses a version of the alexander polynomial ; scharlemann @xcite and livingston @xcite use representations of certain associated groups ; mcatee , silver , and williams @xcite use quandles ; thurston @xcite showed that the kinoshita graph is hyperbolic ( i.e. the exterior supports a complete hyperbolic structure with totally geodesic boundary . )    @xmath6 at 223 433 @xmath7 at 83 137 @xmath8 at 380 140    , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 indicate the number of full twists in each box ( with the sign of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 indicating the direction of the twisting . ) if @xmath9 , the graph is the kinoshita graph .",

    "these graphs depend on braids @xmath12 lying in a certain subgroup of the pure braid group on 4 strands and on integers @xmath13 which represent certain twisting parameters .",
    "our main theorem shows that infinitely many braids @xmath12 give rise to brunnian theta graphs .    for all @xmath14 ,",
    "there exists a braid @xmath15 such that for all @xmath16 , the graph @xmath17 is a brunnian theta graph . furthermore , suppose that for a given @xmath18 , the set @xmath19 has the property that if @xmath20 then @xmath21 is isotopic to @xmath22 and if @xmath23 are distinct , then @xmath24",

    "we are also grateful to ryan blair , ilya kofman , jessica purcell , and maggy tomova for helpful conversations .",
    "this research was partially funded by colby college .",
    "we work in either the pl or smooth category . for a topological space @xmath27 , we let @xmath28 denote the number of components of @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath29 then @xmath30 is a closed regular neighborhood of @xmath31 in @xmath27 and @xmath32 is an open regular neighborhood .",
    "more generally , @xmath33 denotes the interior of @xmath31 .",
    "there are two natural methods for constructing new brunnian theta graphs : vertex sums and clasping .",
    "suppose that @xmath34 and @xmath35 are spatial theta graphs .",
    "let @xmath36 and @xmath37 be vertices .",
    "we can construct a new spatial theta graph @xmath38 by taking the connected sum of @xmath0 with @xmath0 by removing regular open neighborhoods of @xmath39 and @xmath40 and gluing the resulting 3-balls @xmath41 and @xmath42 together by a homeomorphism @xmath43 taking the punctures @xmath44 to the punctures @xmath45",
    ". see figure [ vertex sum ] .",
    "the subscripted 3 represents the fact that we are performing the connected sum along a trivalent vertex and is used to distinguish the vertex sum from the connected sum of graphs occuring along edges of a graph ( which , when both @xmath46 and @xmath47 are theta graphs , does not produce a theta graph . )    an orientation on a spatial theta graph is a choice of one vertex to be the _ source _ , one vertex to be the _ sink _ , and a choice of a total order on the edges of the graph .",
    "if @xmath46 and @xmath47 are oriented theta graphs , we insist that the connected sum produce an oriented theta graph ( so that the sink vertex of @xmath46 is glued to the source vertex of @xmath47 and so that the edges of @xmath48 can be given an ordering which restricts to the given orderings on the edges of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "wolcott @xcite showed that vertex sum of oriented theta graphs is independent ( up to ambient isotopy of the graph ) of the choice of homeomorphism @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath46 and @xmath47 both have the brunnian property , then @xmath49 does as well since the connected sum of two knots is the unknot if and only if both of the original knots are unknots . if @xmath46 ( say ) is trivial , then @xmath48 is isotopic to @xmath47 .",
    "similarly , if at least one of @xmath46 or @xmath47 is non - trivial then @xmath48 is non - trivial @xcite .",
    "consequently :    if @xmath46 and @xmath47 are brunnian theta graphs , then @xmath48 is a brunnian theta graph .",
    "we say that a spatial theta graph is _ vertex - prime _ if it is not the vertex sum of two other non - trivial spatial theta graphs .",
    "the kinoshita graph is vertex prime @xcite . using thurston s hyperbolization theorem for haken manifolds , it is possible to show that if @xmath46 and @xmath47 are theta graphs , then @xmath48 is hyperbolic if and only if @xmath46 and @xmath47 are hyperbolic .",
    "clasping @xcite is a second method for converting a brunnian theta graph into another theta graph with the brunnian property . to explain it ,",
    "suppose that @xmath5 is a spatial theta graph in @xmath0 which has been isotoped so that its intersection with a 3-ball @xmath50 consists of four unknotted arcs ( as on the left of figure [ clasp move ] ) , numbered @xmath51 .",
    "assume that the first arc and the last two arcs belong to the same edge ( the `` red edge '' ) of @xmath5 and that the others belong to different , distinct edges of @xmath5 ( the `` green edge '' and the `` blue edge '' ) .",
    "we require that as we traverse the red edge , the arc @xmath52 is traversed between @xmath53 and @xmath54 . letting @xmath55 be the sub - arc of the red edge containing @xmath56 , we also require that there is an isotopy of @xmath55 , in the complement of the rest of the graph , to an unknotted arc in @xmath57 . as in figure",
    "[ clasp move ] , we may then perform crossing changes to introduce a clasps between adjacent arcs .",
    "it is easily checked that this clasp move preserves the brunnian property .",

    "additionally , very little is known about sequences of clasp moves relating two brunnian theta graphs .",
    "we can , however , use clasping to show that there exist brunnian theta graphs which are _ not _ hyperbolic .",
    "figure [ toroidalbrunnian ] shows an example of a brunnian theta graph with an essential torus in its exterior .",
    "it was created by isotoping a kinoshita - wolcott graph to the position required to apply the clasping move via an isotopy which moved a point on one of the edges around a trefoil knot .",
    "a graph with an essential torus in its exterior is neither hyperbolic nor a trivial graph .",
    "besides the kinoshita graph and vertex sums of the kinoshita graph with itself , are there other hyperbolic brunnian theta graphs ? in this section , we give a new infinite family of examples of diagrams of spatial theta curves . in the next section",
    "we will prove that infinitely many of them are also non - trivial .",
    "these examples have the property that they are of `` low bridge number '' .",
    "forthcoming work @xcite will show that this implies that these graphs are vertex - prime .",
    "furthermore , since they are low bridge number it is likely that they are hyperbolic .",

    "we obtain the group operation for @xmath67 . if @xmath69 and @xmath70 are elements of @xmath67 , we let @xmath71 denote the braid having a representative created by stacking a representative for @xmath69 on top of a representative for @xmath70 and then scaling in the @xmath64-direction by @xmath68 .",

    "the shading indicates the doubled strands . there is more than one choice for the monomorphism @xmath70 , as the doubled strands may be allowed to twist around each other ( i.e. we may vary the framing ) .",
    "we will always choose the homomorphism determined by the `` blackboard framing '' ( i.e. in our diagram the doubled strands are two edges of a rectangle embedded in the plane . ) into the second and fourth boxes from the top we place the braid @xmath79 .",
