    "recently much progress has been made in single particle technologies .",
    "these technologies allow one to manipulate a single electron , a single atom , and a single ion .",
    "a distinguishing feature of all these technologies is that they are `` quantum '' ; quantum effects are crucial for the preparation of the initial state , for performing useful operations , and for reading out the final state .",
    "one of the future quantum technologies is quantum computation . in a quantum computer ,",
    "the information is loaded in a register of quantum bits ",
    "`` qubits '' .",
    "a qubit is a quantum object ( generalized spin 1/2 ) which can occupy two quantum states , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and an arbitrary superposition of these states : @xmath2 .",
    "( the only constraint is : @xmath3 . )",
    "a quantum computer is remarkably efficient in executing newly invented quantum algorithms ( the quantum fourier transform , shor s algorithm for prime factorization , grover s algorithm for data base searching , and others ) . using these algorithms , quantum computing promises to solve problems that are intractable on digital computers .",
    "the main advantage of quantum computation is the rapid , parallel execution of quantum logic operations .",
    "one of the promising directions in quantum computation is solid state quantum computation .",
    "( see the review @xcite . ) in solid state computers , a qubit can be represented by a single nuclear spin 1/2 @xcite , or a single electron spin 1/2 @xcite , a single cooper pair @xcite .",
    "this type of quantum computers is quite different from quantum computers in which a qubit is represented by an ensemble of spins 1/2 @xcite .",
    "crucial mathematical problems must be solved in order to understand the dynamical aspects of quantum computation .",
    "one of these problems is the creation of the dynamical theory of quantum computation  the main subject of our paper .",
    "the processes of the creation of quantum data bases , the storage and searching of quantum information , the implementation of quantum logic gates , and all the steps involved in quantum computation are dynamical processes . when qubits representing a register in a quantum computer are in superpositional states , they are not eigenstates of the hamiltonian describing the quantum computer .",
    "these superpositions are time - dependent .",
    "understanding their dynamics is very important . to design a working quantum computer ,",
    "simulations of quantum logic operations and fragments of quantum computation are essential .",
    "the results of these simulations will enable engineers to optimize and test quantum computers .",
    "there are two main obstacles to perform useful quantum logic operations with large number of qubits on a digital ( classical ) computer : ( 1 ) the related hilbert space is extremely large , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of qubits ( spins ) , and ( 2 ) even if the initial state of a quantum computer does not involve many basic states ( eigenstates ) , the number of excited eigenstates can rapidly grow during the process of performing quantum logic operations .",
    "generally both of these obstacles exist . at the same time",
    ", many useful quantum operations can be simulated on a digital computer even if the number of qubits is quite large , say 1000 .",
    "how one can do this ?",
    "one way is to create ( and use ) a _ perturbation theory of quantum computation_. to do this , one should consider a quantum computer as a many - particle quantum system and introduce small parameters .",
    "usually , in _ all _ physical problems there exist small parameters which allow one to simplify the problem to find approximate solutions .",
    "the objective in this approach is to build a solution in a controlled way .",
    "as an example , it is useful to consider an electron in a hydrogen atom interacting with a laser field .",
    "the electron has an infinite ( formally ) number of discrete levels plus a continuous part of its energy spectrum .",
    "so , a single electron in a hydrogen atom has a hilbert space larger than _ all _ finite qubit quantum computers .",
    "assume that the electron is populated initially on some energy level(s ) .",
    "the action of the laser field on the electron leads in many cases to a regular and controlled dynamics of the electron .",
    "in particular , if the amplitude of the laser field is small enough , the electron interacting with this laser field can be considered as a two - level quantum system interacting with an external time - periodic field .",
    "why is the electron excited to only few energy levels ?",
    "this happens because the existence of small parameters makes the probability of unwanted events ( excitation of the electron to most energy levels including the continuum ) negligibly small .",
    "the existence of small parameters allows one to use perturbation approaches when calculating the quantum dynamics of the electron .",
    "this strategy can be used to create a perturbation theory of quantum computation .    in this paper",
    "we present our results , based on the existence of small parameters , for simulating quantum logic operations with a large number ( up to 1000 ) of qubits .",
    "our perturbation approach does not provide a substitution for computing quantum algorithms on a quantum computer .",
    "one will need quantum computer to do the required calculations .",
    "our method will allow one to simulate the required benchmarks , quantum logic test operations , and fragments of quantum algorithms .",
    "our method will enable engineers to optimize a working quantum computer .",
    "in section 1 , we formulate our model and the hamiltonian of a quantum computer based on a one - dimensional nuclear spin chain .",
    "spins interact through nearest - neighbor ising interactions .",
    "all spins are placed in a magnetic field with the uniform gradient .",
    "this field gradient enables the selective excitation of spins .",
    "quantum logic operations are provided by applying the required resonant electromagnetic pulses . in section 2 , we present the dynamical equations of motion in the interaction representation .",
    "as well , we discuss an alternative description based on the transformation to the rotating frame . in the latter case",
    "the effective hamiltonian is independent of time and solution of the problem can be obtained using the eigenstates of this hamiltonian . in section 3 , we derive simplified dynamical equations taking into account only resonant and near - resonant transitions ( and neglecting non - resonant transitions ) .",
    "we introduce the small parameters which characterize the probability of generation of unwanted states in the result of near - resonant transitions .",
    "we describe a @xmath6-method which allows us to minimize the influence of unwanted near - resonant effects which can destroy quantum logic operations . in section 4",
    ", we describe a quantum control - not gate for remote qubits in a quantum computer with a large number of qubits .",
    "analytical solution for this gate is presented in section 5 , for the @xmath6 condition . in section 6 ,",
    "we present small parameters of the problem , in explicit form .",
    "the equation for the total probability of generation of unwanted states , including the states generated in the result of near - resonant and non - resonant transition , is derived in section 7 . in section 8 ,",
    "we present results of numerical simulations of the quantum control - not gate for remote qubits in quantum computers with 200 and 1000 qubits when the probability of the near - resonant transitions is relatively large ( when the conditions of @xmath6-method are not satisfied ) .",
    "we show that : ( a ) the probability distribution of unwanted states has a `` band '' structure , ( b ) the directions of spins in typical unwanted states are highly correlated , and ( c ) many of the unwanted states are high - energy states of the quantum computer ( a spin chain ) .",
    "the total probability of error ( including the states generated in the result of near - resonant and non - resonant transitions ) is computed numerically in section 9 for small ( @xmath7 ) and large ( @xmath8 ) number of qubits .",
    "a range of parameters is found in which the probability of error does not exceed a definite threshold .",
    "we test our perturbative approach using exact numerical solution when the number of qubits is small ( @xmath7 ) . in section 10 ,",
    "we show how the problem of quantum computation ( even with large number of qubits ) can be formulated classically in terms of interacting one - dimensional oscillators . in the conclusion ,",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "the mathematical model of a quantum computer used in this paper is based on a one - dimensional ising nuclear - spin system  a chain of @xmath5 identical nuclear spins ( qubits ) .",
    "application of ising spin systems for quantum computations was first suggested in ref.@xcite . today , these systems are used in liquid nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) quantum computation with small number of qubits @xcite .",
    "the register ( a 1d chain of @xmath5 identical nuclear spins ) is placed in a magnetic field , @xmath9 , -b^{(n)}_\\perp\\sin\\left[\\nu^{(n ) } t+\\varphi^{(n)}\\right ] , b^z(z)\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in ( 1 ) , @xmath12 is a slightly non - uniform magnetic field oriented in the positive @xmath13-direction .",
    "the quantities @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are , respectively , the amplitude , the frequency , and the initial phase of the circular polarized ( in the @xmath17 plane ) magnetic field .",

    "the eigenstates of the spin chain can be described as a combination of @xmath33 individual states of nuclear spins , latexmath:[\\[\\label{6 }    state @xmath0 corresponds to the direction of a nuclear spin along the direction of the magnetic field , @xmath12 , and the state @xmath1 corresponds to the opposite direction .",

    "( for example , for a proton in the field @xmath39 t , one has the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) frequency @xmath40mhz . ) we assume , for definiteness , that the gradient of the magnetic field is positive , @xmath41 .",

    "the quantum state of the quantum computer is described by the wave function @xmath54 .",
    "the dynamics of this function is given by the solution of the schrdinger equation , @xmath55 where dot means derivative over time .",

    "in this section , we describe the main simplification procedure which is based on the separation of resonant and non - resonant interactions .",
    "this procedure is commonly used in studying linear and non - linear dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "the main idea of this approach is the following .",
    "when the frequency of the external field , @xmath73 , is equal ( or close ) to the eigenfrequency of the system under consideration , @xmath111 , and when a small parameter exists ( the interaction is relatively weak ) , one can separate the slow ( resonant ) dynamics from the fast ( non - resonant ) dynamics .",
    "the main contribution to the evolution of the system is associated with resonant effects .",
    "usually , non - resonant effects are small , and can be considered using perturbation approaches . in quantum computation ,",
    "the problem of non - resonant effects is more complicated because these effects can accumulate in time creating significant errors in the process of quantum computation .",
    "so , in quantum computation , the non - resonant effects must not only be taken into consideration , but they must also be minimized .",
    "below , we describe methods which allow us to minimize the influence of non - resonant effects .    in classical dynamical systems , the separation of resonant and non - resonant effects is very efficient when `` action - angle '' variables are used . in this case",
    ", the `` action '' is a slow variable and the `` angle '' ( the `` phase '' ) is a fast variable . from this point of view ,",
    "( [ 15 ] ) are convenient because they are written in the `` energy '' representation in which the slow ( resonant ) effects and fast ( non - resonant ) effects can be naturally separated .",
    "first , we note that as the number of spins , @xmath5 , increases , the number of eigenstates , @xmath60 , increases exponentially ( as @xmath33 ) , but the number of _ resonant frequencies _ in our system grows only linearly in @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , the number of resonant frequencies is @xmath112 because only single - spin transitions are allowed by the operator @xmath22 in ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the definition of the resonant frequency is the following .",
    "we introduce the frequency of the single - spin transition : @xmath111 , where @xmath61 and @xmath113 are two eigenstates , @xmath60 and @xmath71 , of the hamiltonian @xmath32 with opposite orientations of only the @xmath35-th spin , ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "for example , @xmath115th and @xmath116th states , @xmath117 , of the @xmath25-th external _ rf _ pulse is defined as follows : @xmath118 the only resonant frequencies of our nuclear spin quantum computer are , @xmath119 @xmath120 where the larmor frequencies , @xmath37 . all resonant frequencies in ( [ 18 ] )",
    "are assumed to be positive . for end spins with @xmath121 and @xmath122 , the upper and lower signs in (",
    "[ 18 ] ) correspond to the states @xmath0 or @xmath1 of their only neighboring spins . for inner spins with @xmath123",
    "the frequency @xmath36 corresponds to having nearest neighbors whose spins are in opposite directions to each other .",
    "the `` + '' sign corresponds to having the nearest neighbors in their ground state .",
    "the `` - '' sign corresponds to having the nearest neighbors in their excited state .    as an example , consider the resonant frequency of a single - spin transition between the following two eigenstates , @xmath124 @xmath125 these two eigenstates differ by a transition of the @xmath35-th spin from its ground state , @xmath126 , to its excited state , @xmath127 .",
    "all other spins in the quantum computer remain in their initial states . according to ( [ 2 ] ) , the eigenvalues of the states @xmath60 and @xmath71 are : @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the total energy of all @xmath130 ( except the @xmath35-th ) which did not participate in the transition .",
    "it follows from ( [ 20 ] ) that in this case , the resonance frequency , @xmath117 , of the @xmath25-th pulse is , @xmath131 this frequency belongs to the set of the resonant frequencies introduced in ( [ 18 ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we assume that our protocol includes only the resonant frequencies from ( 18 ) , and we will omit the subscript `` res '' .      in this sub - section",
    "we derive the approximate equations for resonant and near - resonant transitions , in the system .",
    "consider an arbitrary eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath32 , @xmath132 .",
    "assume that one applies to the spin chain a resonant _ rf _ pulse of a frequency , @xmath73 , from ( [ 18 ] ) .",

    "one has a resonant transition . in the second case ,",
    "one has a near - resonant transition .",
    "if the small parameters exist , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 , we can neglect all non - resonant transitions related to a flip of @xmath137th non - resonant spin .",
    "below , in section [ sec : numerical ] , we will write a rigorous condition for @xmath138 which is required in order to neglect all non - resonant transitions .    thus ,",
    "considering the dynamics of any state ( [ 22 ] ) under the action of an _ rf _ pulse with the frequency , @xmath73 , from ( [ 17 ] ) , ( [ 18 ] ) , we need only to take into account one transition",
    ". this transition will be either a resonant one or a near - resonant one .",

    "when the value of @xmath138 is large enough , the probability of error ( and the widths of the hatched areas in @xmath163 ) becomes practically independent of @xmath138 .",
    "this is because at @xmath348 and at @xmath318 the error is mostly defined by @xmath268 , which is independent of @xmath138 . as a consequence , one can , for example , estimate the widths of the hatched areas at @xmath348 taking into account only the near - resonant transitions ( formula ( [ 41a ] ) ) .    in order to test our approximate result we solved the problem exactly using the eigenstates of the matrices @xmath77 , @xmath357 , for the parameters which correspond to the lower boundary of the hatched regions in the figs .",

    "6a and 6b , that there is a good correspondence between the exact and approximate solutions .",
    "a similar correspondence can be demonstrated for other points of the parametric space ( @xmath358 ) when the conditions @xmath359 are satisfied .",
    "in this section we demonstrate that the process of quantum computation , including creation of the entanglement , the dynamics of quantum controlled operations , and the dynamics of complicated quantum algorithms can be modeled using classical hamiltonians .",
    "that is not surprising because the basic quantum equations ( [ 15 ] ) are @xmath360-number equations and can be formally considered as an effective classical system of equations .",
    "the above results show that in some cases , effective classical hamiltonians can be used for simulation of quantum logic operations even for large number of qubits .",
    "we present here the corresponding effective classical hamiltonian and the hamiltonian equations of motion in explicit form .",
    "formally , we can represent the solution of the schrdinger equation for the hamiltonian ( [ 2])-([4 ] ) in the form : @xmath361 , where @xmath362 and @xmath363 are the eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues of the ising part of the hamiltonian in ( [ 2 ] ) in the @xmath13-representation , @xmath364 the complex coefficients , @xmath365 , satisfy the equations , @xmath366 where , @xmath367 and @xmath368 is the interaction hamiltonian in ( [ 2 ] ) .    equation ( [ 44 ] ) can be written in hamiltonian form : @xmath369 where @xmath370 is the hamiltonian of the equivalent `` classical '' system , @xmath371 instead of using complex `` classical '' variables , @xmath372 and @xmath373 , one can introduce the following real `` classical '' variables : a `` coordinate '' , @xmath374 , and a `` momentum '' , @xmath375 , using , for example , the canonical transformation , @xmath376 using @xmath374 and @xmath375 , eqs .",
    "( [ 46 ] ) take the familiar classical hamiltonian form , @xmath377 where the equivalent classical hamiltonian is , @xmath378 the hamiltonian ( [ 50 ] ) can be written in the form , @xmath379 @xmath380,\\ ] ] where we used the relations : @xmath381 , and @xmath382 , @xmath383 .",

    "( [ 51 ] ) describe the hamiltonian dynamics of @xmath33 classical `` generalized '' one - dimensional oscillators .",
    "each of these oscillators is described by two canonically conjugate variables , @xmath374 and @xmath375 .",
    "one can see that @xmath33 classical harmonic oscillators can simulate the behavior of @xmath5 interacting quantum qubits , including the dynamics of quantum entanglement , complicated quantum logic gates , and quantum algorithms .",
    "in this paper , we developed an approach , based on small parameters , for the simulation of simple quantum logic operations in a nuclear spin quantum computer with large number of qubits .",
    "we considered a quantum computer which is a one - dimensional nuclear spin chain placed in a slightly non - uniform magnetic field , oriented in a direction chosen to suppress the dipole interaction between spins .",
    "we took into consideration the ising interaction between neighboring qubits .",
    "quantum logic operations are implemented by applying resonant electromagnetic pulses to the nuclear spin chain .",
    "the electromagnetic pulse which is resonant to a selected qubit is non - resonant for all other qubits .",
    "this raises the problem of minimizing the influence of unwanted non - resonant effects in the process of performing a quantum protocol .",
    "we simulate the creation of the long - distance entanglement between remote qubits , @xmath221-st and @xmath389-th , in a nuclear spin quantum computer having a large number of qubits ( up to 1000 ) .",
    "we used two essential assumptions : + 1 .",
    "the nuclear spin chain is prepared initially in its ground state .",
    "the frequency difference between the neighboring spins due to the inhomogeneity of the external magnetic field , @xmath138 , is much larger than the ising interaction constant , @xmath314 , and @xmath314 is much larger than the rabi frequency , @xmath163 , i. e. @xmath359 .",
    "using these assumptions , we developed a numerical method which allowed us to simulate the dynamics of quantum logic operations taking into consideration all quantum states with the probability no less that @xmath390 .",
    "for the case when the @xmath6 condition is satisfied ( the @xmath158-pulse for the resonant transition is at the same time a @xmath6-pulse for non - resonant transitions ) , we obtained an analytic solution for the evolution of the nuclear spin chain . in the case of small deviations from the @xmath6 condition , the error accumulates and the numerical simulations are required .",
    "these results are presented in sections [ sec : simulat ] and [ sec : numerical ] .",
    "the main results of our simulations are the following : + 1 .",
    "the unwanted states exhibit a band structure in their probability distributions .",
    "there are two main `` bands '' in the probability distribution of unwanted states .",
    "the unwanted states in these `` bands '' have significantly different probabilities , @xmath391 .",
    "each of these two bands have their own structures .",
    "a typical unwanted state is a state of highly correlated spin excitations .",
    "an important fact is that the unwanted states with relatively _ high probability _ include high energy states of the spin chain ( many - spin excitations ) .",
    "the method developed allowed us to study the generation of unwanted states and the probability of the desired states as a function of the distortion of _ rf _ pulses .",
    "this can be used to formulate the requirements for acceptable errors in quantum computation .",
    "the results of this paper can be used to design experimental implementations of quantum logic operations and to estimate ( benchmark ) the reliability of experimental quantum computer devices .",
    "our approach can be extended to simulations of simple quantum arithmetic operations and fragments of quantum algorithms .",
