    "studies of physical phenomena in two - dimensional metals and thin films often lead to mixed electrostatic boundary - value problems .",
    "@xcite a prototypical example is the task of determining the density profile @xmath0 of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron liquid in the proximity of external charges or voltage sources . such charges and sources are used in practical applications to manipulate the electron liquid into desired geometrical shapes , e.g. , quantum dots , narrow wires , constrictions , _ etc_. they are also used to intentionally introduce defects , such as antidots ,  @xcite into an otherwise homogeneous system .",
    "in addition to artificial sources of external potentials , in real materials electrons also experience a random potential of ubiquitous charged impurities .",
    "it appears therefore that methods that can tackle the corresponding electrostatic problems could be of considerable value both for applied and for fundamental research .",
    "unfortunately , the boundary - value problems are notoriously difficult to solve analytically .",
    "the goal of the this paper is to show that either the complete analytical solutions or their exact asymptotics can be found for a number of nontrivial basic geometries .    our most unexpected unexpected result concerns the electrostatics of a constriction .",
    "we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : saddle ] that the long - range coulomb interaction can cause a significant narrowing of the region occupied by the 2d electron liquid in the constriction and that the boundaries of this region are described by an interesting nonanalytic function , see eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) .",
    "the present article extends and generalizes the results available in the literature , e.g. , refs .   and  , and came as an outgrowth of our recent work  @xcite on the electrostatics of disordered 2d systems .",
    "we will consider 2d electron systems that are separated from grounded electrodes or other screening bodies by distances much larger than the interelectron spacing .",
    "such conditions are realized in semiconductor heterostructures and in field - effect transistors with thick insulator layers . in these systems electrons",
    "interact via the @xmath1 coulomb law and form a metallic liquid if their density is not too low .",
    "the results of the present work are obtained within the approximation that the thomas - fermi screening radius @xmath2 of the electron liquid metallic is vanishingly small .",
    "this is the correct leading - order approximation if all lengthscales of interest exceed @xmath2 .    in typical semiconductor realizations of 2d systems ,",
    "@xmath2 is of the order of the interelectron separation @xmath3 , and so our approach is good for studying variations of @xmath0 on lengthscales larger than @xmath4 .",
    "note that this does not necessarily prohibit us from describing some effects that are due to discreteness of electrons .",
    "for example , in sec .",
    "[ sec : island ] we will be able to calculate the energy spacing of the coulomb blockade peaks because in the leading order it is determined by the classical capacitance .",
    "on the other hand , the equations below can not be used , e.g. , to study quantum dots with just a few electrons .",
    "also , these equations do not apply too close to the edges of the metallic regions where @xmath5 and so , formally , @xmath6 .",
    "still , even in these situations the solution of the corresponding electrostatic problem should provide a valuable insight .    in the approximation of vanishingly small @xmath2 ,",
    "the electrostatic potential @xmath7 in the regions occupied by the electron liquid is perfectly flat , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the electrochemical potential .",
    "the rest of the 2d plane is occupied by the depletion regions ( dr )  the areas of exponentially small , effectively zero electron density that are classically forbidden for the electrons : @xmath10 our goal is to study the conditions that cause drs to appear and their detailed stricture .",
    "@xcite to finalize the formulation of the electrostatic problem we wish to solve for this purpose , we need an expression for @xmath11 in terms of @xmath12 .",
    "we distinguish two cases .",
    "_ case a_. if the number of electrons @xmath13 in the system is finite , we use @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the external electrostatic potential and @xmath16 is the dielectric constant of the medium",
    ".    _ case b_. if we deal with an infinite system with a nonzero average electron concentration , we define @xmath11 as follows : @xmath17 here @xmath18 represents a spatially nonuniform background of opposite charge . in this formulation",
    "the primary parameter is the average background density @xmath19 , and the electrochemical potential in eqs .",
    "( [ bc_metal ] ) and ( [ bc_dr ] ) is determined by electroneutrality of the system as a whole , so that @xmath9 is a function of @xmath20 .",
    "there is no loss in generality in assuming that the background charge density @xmath18 is confined to the same 2d plane as the electrons .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see that an arbitrary three - dimensional charge density distribution @xmath21 creates essentially the same electrostatic potential in the @xmath22 plane as the following effective 2d density : @xmath23^{3/2}}. \\label{sigma_from_sigma_3}\\ ] ] the only difference between the two potentials is the @xmath24-independent term @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , given by @xmath27 is the inverse geometric capacitance per unit area between the 2d layer and the external sources [ @xmath28 denotes the three - dimensional ( 3d ) spatial average ] . as the name implies ,",
    "@xmath26 is usually determined by the fixed dimensions of the structure and the electrodes , and so it is almost independent of @xmath20 . in this situation , a finite @xmath26 causes only a trivial linear shift of the electrochemical potential @xmath9 , while the interesting quantity is the deviation @xmath29 this is one of the quantities we will be calculating below .",
    "we will assume that @xmath15 and @xmath18 , whichever is appropriate , are smooth and bounded functions .",
    "the major difficulty in solving the above equations stems from the mixed boundary conditions  ( [ bc_metal ] ) and ( [ bc_dr ] ) .",
    "these conditions do not specify where the boundaries of the drs reside or what the potential inside the drs is .",
    "they merely state that the drs may exist and that inside of them @xmath30 must exceed a certain constant value @xmath9 .",
    "it seems that in the general case , one can make only the following two trivial statements .",
    "first , in the formulation  ( [ phi_finite_sys ] ) the metallic regions are located in areas where the potential energy @xmath31 is sufficiently low , the rest of the 2d plane being a dr .",
    "second , in the formulation  ( [ phi_inf_sys ] ) , drs surround negative local minima of @xmath18 . [ if @xmath32 is nonegative everywhere , then the sought ground state is simply @xmath33 and the system is free of drs ] .",
    "as alluded to above , there has been a sizeable amount of work devoted to the electrostatics of disordered electron systems .",
    "prominent early investigations include those of efros and shklovskii  @xcite on the nonlinear screening in 3d doped semiconductors and its extensions to 2d .",
    "@xcite in disordered systems drs typically have some irregular shapes , and so there is no any convenient coordinate system that can be used to take advantage of the known techniques of solving integral equations .",
    "thus , the random case seems mathematically intractable .",
    "rigorous results that have been obtained for such problems are limited to certain scaling laws  @xcite and some asymptotical limits .",
    "@xcite there is a hope however that in regular geometries analytical solutions could be easier to derive .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "for example , if the external potential @xmath34 depends only on one coordinate , say , @xmath35 , then the problem can be reduced to an equation for just a few parameters , the positions of the dr edges .",
    "@xcite once they are determined , the density @xmath36 at all other @xmath35 can be found from simple analytical formulas , see an example below .",
    "similarly , there is a closed - form solution in quadratures for the axially - symmetric case , @xmath37 , provided there is only one dr .",
    "@xcite in other words , it is known how to find the density profile @xmath38 of a single round droplet or around a circular depletion hole .",
    "let us give a few examples .      _",
    "example 1_. our first example is a metallic droplet confined laterally by a parabolic external potential @xmath39 the density profile of such a droplet is known to be hemispherical  @xcite @xmath40 with the radius @xmath41 of the droplet related to its electrochemical potential by @xmath42 .",
    "_ example 2_. another instructive example is an isolated dr in the form of a perfect circle . as noted above",
    ", such a depletion hole can form when @xmath18 has an isolated negative minimum , @xmath43 .",
    "let this minimum be located at the origin , @xmath44 , and let the radius @xmath41 of the induced depletion hole be small enough so that the expansion @xmath45 can be used .",
    "following the formalism of ref .",

    "note that all the presented exact solutions , eqs .",
    "( [ n_round_droplet ] ) , ( [ n_round_hole ] ) , and ( [ n_slit ] ) , agree with a well - known result  @xcite that @xmath0 has a square - root singularity near the edge of the dr . previously , these solutions and their generalizations have been used to study the edges of 2d electron liquid ,  @xcite quantum wires ,  @xcite quantum dots ,  @xcite and antidots .",
    "@xcite    in a sense , all the aforementioned examples are one - dimensional because @xmath15 [ or @xmath18 ] depend on a single variable . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "there are no published exact solutions for truly 2d cases , i.e. , for the geometries where @xmath15 and @xmath18 are smooth functions of position and have no translational or rotational symmetries .",

    "second , it serves as a testground for an approximate method of solving electrostatic problems suggested in our previous publication .",

    "a detailed comparison with the available experimental data is deferred for future work .",

    "the quickest way to obtain the solution for arbitrary @xmath59 and @xmath60 is to use a classic theorem of frank w.  dyson .",
    "@xcite one of the corollaries of this theorem concerns the 2d charge density distribution @xmath61 which defines an elliptically shaped droplet with semiaxes @xmath41 and @xmath62 .",

    "the symbols nearby each curve are from numerical simulations for the corresponding @xmath20 .",
    "[ fig_cb_var ] , width=230 ]    to test the ta method further we can directly compare the density distribution @xmath378 with the numerically determined ground state @xmath0 .",

    "[ fig_cb_a ] , width=211 ]    finally , let us discuss the estimate of the percolation threshold that follows from the ta .",
    "according to the ta , the boundaries of the dr are defined by the equation @xmath384 .",
    "therefore , the percolation occurs at the average density @xmath385 that satisfies the relation @xmath386 . under this condition ,",
    "the dr boundary passes simultaneously through all the saddle - points in the system .",
    "for example , within a single rectangular unit cell , the dr has the shape of a rhombus with vertices at the midpoints of the cell edges .",
    "solving the above equation numerically , we found @xmath387 .",
    "this number is independent of @xmath388 because checkerboards with different @xmath389 can be mapped onto each other by rescaling the coordinate axes . within the ta ,",
    "such a rescaling does not change the topology of the drs or the average electron density .    clearly , the ta is unable to resolve the existence of two separate thresholds , @xmath328 and @xmath315 in the asymmetric checherboard . within the ta ,",
    "the percolation occurs simultaneously in the @xmath35- and @xmath51-directions .",
    "still , @xmath385 is remarkably close to the upper ( global ) percolation threshold determined numerically for @xmath390 , see eq .",
    "( [ n_p_z2 ] ) .",
    "this is also the case at larger @xmath389 , e.g. , at @xmath391 where we found @xmath392 . on the other hand , at lower @xmath389 the discrepancy grows and reaches its largest relative size of about @xmath393 at @xmath394 , see eq .",
    "( [ n_p_z1 ] ) .",
    "we believe that these discrepancies ( one threshold instead of two and the value of @xmath315 ) originate from the two drawbacks of the ta method we mentioned earlier .",
    "one is its unability to handle widely separate lengthscales , which is the case in checkerboards with large @xmath389 .",
    "the other is its weakness in dealing with the saddle - points .",
    "the funneling effect of the saddle - points allows the electron droplets to reach them sooner as @xmath20 increases .",
    "therefore , the continuity of the electron liquid is established at a lower @xmath20 compared to that predicted by the ta .",
    "one may wonder why the ta method is able to predict @xmath315 with a much higher accuracy  @xcite ( @xmath395 ) in the case of a random @xmath396 .",
    "one possible explanation is as follows .",
    "the funneling effect of the saddle - points that is mishandled by the ta method is especially pronounced in the checkerboard geometry because all the saddle - points have the same value of @xmath32 , so that the percolation contour has to pass through all of them simultaneously .",
    "thus , the inaccuracy of our ta is maximized precisely at @xmath397 .",
    "in contrast , in the case of a random @xmath18 the percolation contour passes precisely through the center of a saddle - point very rarely , and so the ta works very well .",
    "we conclude that the ta method is an excellent and convenient tool for determining the ground - state energy and depleted area fraction but it may be less accurate when it comes to more subtle parameters of the real - space structure , especially if those are heavily dominated by the saddle - points or a hierarchy of multiple lengthscales .",
