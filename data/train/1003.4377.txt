    "momentum correlations of particles at small relative velocities are widely used to study the spatio - temporal characteristics of the production processes in relativistic heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "this technique , called after lednicky _ correlation femtoscopy _",
    "@xcite , originates from photon intensity interferometry initiated by hanbury brown and twiss  @xcite .",
    "implemented to nuclear physics  @xcite it permits to determine the duration of the emission process and the size of the source from which the particles are emitted  @xcite .",
    "a central role plays the correlation function which has been defined as the measured two - particle distribution normalized to a reference spectrum obtained by mixing particles from different events  @xcite .",
    "the importance of the correlation femtoscopy has been well established for investigations of the dynamics of heavy ion collisions with high multiplicity .",
    "however , as pointed out by chajecki  @xcite , in the case of low - multiplicity collisions the interpretation of correlation function measurements is still not fully satisfactory , especially in view of the surprising observation by the star collaboration indicating universality of the resulting femtoscopic radii for both , the hadronic ( proton - proton ) , and heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "one of the challenging issues in this context is the understanding of contributions from non - femtoscopic correlations which may be induced by the decays of resonances , global conservation laws  @xcite , or by other unaccounted interactions .",
    "in contrast to heavy ion collisions , in the case of single meson production , the kinematics of all ejectiles may be entirely determined and hence a kinematically complete measurement of meson production in the collisions of hadrons gives access to complementary information which could shed light on the interpretation of the two - proton correlations observed in heavy ion reactions .",
    "it is also important to underline that the correlation of protons was never exploited till now in near threshold meson productions , and as an observable different from the distributions of cross sections , it may deepen our understanding of the dynamics of meson production .",
    "particularly favourable are exclusive experiments conducted close to the kinematical threshold where the fraction of the available phase - space associated with low relative momenta between the ejectiles is large  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we report on a @xmath1 meson and multi - pion production experiment in which the mesons were created in collisions of protons at a beam momentum of 2.0259  gev / c corresponding to an excess energy of q = 15.5  mev for the @xmath6 reaction .",
    "the measurement of the two - proton correlation function for these reactions is important not only in the context of studying the dynamics underlying the heavy ion physics .",
    "such investigations are interesting by themselves because they offer a new promising diagnostic tool , still not exploited , for studying the dynamics of meson production in hadron collisions .",
    "the correlation function carries information about the emitting source and , in particular , about the size of the interaction volume of the @xmath6 process .",
    "the knowledge of this size might be essential to answer the intriguing question whether the three - body @xmath4 system is capable of supporting an unstable borromean bound state .",
    "borromean systems may be realized in a variety of objects on the macroscopic ( e.g. strips of papers ) , molecular  @xcite and nuclear scale ( e.g. @xmath7li or @xmath8he nuclei  @xcite ) .",
    "according to wycech  @xcite , the large enhancement of the excitation function for the @xmath6 reaction observed close to the kinematical threshold may be explained by assuming that the proton - proton pair is emitted from a large ( borromean like ) object whose radius is about 4  fm .",
    "the experiment was conducted using the proton beam of the cooler synchrotron cosy  @xcite and an internal hydrogen cluster target  @xcite .",
    "momentum vectors of outgoing protons from the @xmath0 reaction were measured by means of the cosy-11 facility  @xcite presented schematically in figure  [ fig : cosy ] .     reaction .",
    "the positively charged particles were identified using the time of flight between the scintillator detectors s1 and s3 combined with a momentum reconstruction by tracking back the trajectories ( reconstructed based on the signals from the drift chambers d1 and d2 ) through the magnetic field of the cosy dipole to the reaction point .",
    "the size of the detectors and their relative distances are not to scale .",
    "more detailed description can be found in  @xcite.,width=264 ]    the two - proton correlation function @xmath9 was determined for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 systems , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath9 denotes a projection of the correlation function onto the momentum of one of the protons in the proton - proton center - of - mass system take as the independent variable the relative momentum of emitted particles @xmath10 with @xmath11 . ] .",
    "it was calculated , by means of the well established technique , as a ratio of the momentum ( @xmath12 ) dependent reaction yield @xmath13 to the uncorrelated yield @xmath14 according to the formula ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes an appropriate normalization constant .",
    "@xmath14 was derived from the uncorrelated reference sample obtained by using the event mixing technique introduced by kopylov and podgoretsky  @xcite .",
    "the separation of the correlations of the @xmath2 from the @xmath3 system and corrections for the limited acceptance of the detection system constitute the two main challenges to be solved when deriving the correlation function from the experimental data .    [",
    "[ separation - of - events - from - the - production - of - ppeta - and - pppions - systems ] ] separation of events from the production of @xmath4 and @xmath3 systems ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    in the discussed experiment , the four - momenta of the two final state protons were measured only , and the unobserved meson was identified via the missing mass technique  @xcite . in such situations the entirely accessible information about the reaction",
    "is contained in the momentum vectors of the registered protons .",
    "therefore , it is impossible to know whether in a given event the @xmath1 meson or a few pions have been created .",
    "however , statistically one can separate these groups of events using the missing mass spectra for each chosen region of the phase - space .",
    "thus , @xmath17 can be extracted for each studied interval of @xmath12 by grouping the sample of measured events according to the value of @xmath12 , next calculating the missing mass spectra of the @xmath18 reaction for each sub - sample separately , and counting the number of @xmath4 events from these spectra .",
    "examples of typical missing mass histograms for three different @xmath12 intervals are presented in figure  [ fig : stat_back ] .",
    "the statistics obtained in the considered measurement allowed to divide the kinematically available range of @xmath12 into bins whose width ( @xmath19  mev / c ) corresponds approximately to the accuracy of the determination of @xmath12 with ( @xmath20  mev / c ) .",
    "a clear signal of @xmath1 meson production is observed in each spectrum on top of a continuous distribution originating from the multi - pion production .",
    "it is important to note that in the studied range of the missing mass the observed shape of the multi - pion distributions is well reproduced in corresponding simulation studies for each region of the phase space  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : stat_back],title=\"fig : \" ]    an extraction of @xmath28 - unbiased by the multi - pion production - is , however , not trivial . applying a mixing technique one can construct the uncorrelated reference sample , taking momentum vectors of protons corresponding to different real events .",
    "a real event is determined by the momentum vectors of two protons registered in coincidence , and an uncorrelated event will thus comprise momentum vectors of protons ejected from different reactions .",
    "unfortunately , in such a sample of uncorrelated momentum vectors , due to the loss of the kinematical bounds , the production of the @xmath1 meson will be not reflected on the missing mass spectrum and hence it can not be used to extract a number of mixed - events corresponding to the production of the @xmath1 meson . therefore , in order to determine a background - free correlation function for the @xmath27 reaction we performed the following analysis : first , for each event , the probability @xmath29 was determined that this event corresponds to the @xmath27 reaction .",
    "the probability @xmath30 , that the @xmath31 event with a missing mass @xmath32 , and a relative momentum of @xmath33 corresponds to a @xmath27 reaction was estimated according to the formula : @xmath34 where @xmath35 stands for the number of the @xmath27 reactions and @xmath36 is the number of events corresponding to the multi - pion production with the invariant mass equal to @xmath32 .",
    "the values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 were extracted from the missing mass distributions produced separately for each of the studied intervals of @xmath12 .",
    "an example of a missing mass spectrum with pictorial definitions of @xmath36 and @xmath35 is presented in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : stat_back ] .",
    "now having introduced the weights we can calculate also the value of @xmath14 separately for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 final states .",
    "we can achieve this by sorting an uncorrelated sample according to the @xmath12 values similarly as in the case of the correlated events and next for each sub - sample we construct background free @xmath39 distributions as a sum of the probabilities that both protons in an uncorrelated event originate from the reaction where the @xmath1 meson was created . specifically ,",
    "if in a given uncorrelated event denoted by @xmath40 , one momentum is taken from a real event say @xmath41 and the second momentum from another real event @xmath42 , then the probability that both correspond to reactions where an @xmath1 was created equals to @xmath43 , and hence the uncorrelated yield @xmath39 may be constructed from the sum @xmath44 , where @xmath40 enumerates events in the uncorrelated sub - sample selected for a momentum range @xmath12 .        as the next necessary step in the data evaluation we corrected the determined yields to account for the finite geometrical acceptance and detection efficiency of the cosy-11 detectors  @xcite .",
    "hereafter for simplicity by `` acceptance '' both the geometrical acceptance and detection efficiency will be denoted .",
    "the acceptance was calculated as a function of the proton momentum in the proton - proton rest frame @xmath12 .",
    "it was obtained using monte - carlo simulations and evaluated according to formula : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote the number of accepted and generated events , respectively .",
    "simulations were performed based on the geant-3 packages  @xcite including the realistic geometry of the detectors and a precise map of the field of the dipole magnet . the momentum and spatial beam spreads , multiple scattering , proton - proton final state interaction  @xcite and other known physical and instrumental effects",
    "were taken into account  @xcite .",
    "knowing the acceptance  @xcite it would be straightforward to correct the nominator of equation  [ equ:3 ] , however the correction of the uncorrelated yield @xmath14 is not trivial since the momenta of protons in the uncorrelated event originate from two idependent real events which in general could correspond to different values of the detector acceptance .",
    "+ therefore , in order to derive a correlation function corrected for the acceptance , we have created a sample of data that would have been measured with an ideal detector .",
    "for this aim each experimental @xmath6 event was multiplied by 1/a(k ) .",
    "this means that a given reconstructed @xmath6 event with momentum of k was added to the experimental data sample @xmath50 times .",
    "based on this corrected data sample we calculated the two - proton correlation function according to equation  [ equ:3 ] . in order to avoid mixing between the same events , a `` mixing step '' in the calculations",
    "was set to a value bigger than the inverse of the lowest acceptance value .",
    "the random repetition of identical combinations was also omitted by increasing correspondingly the `` mixing step '' .",
    "in particular , a l@xmath51 event , from the acceptance corrected data sample , was `` mixed '' with a ( l+n)@xmath51 event , where @xmath52 .",
    "if the ( l+1)@xmath51 event was the same as l@xmath51 , then this was mixed with a ( l+1 + 2n ) event , etc .",
    "the two - proton background - free correlation functions for the @xmath27 and @xmath53 reactions corrected for the acceptances are presented in figure  [ corr : mcexp ] ( full squares ) . as mentioned in the introduction",
    "the shape of the obtained correlation function reflects not only the space - time characteristics of the interaction volume but it may also be strongly modified by the conservation of energy and momentum and by the final state interaction among the ejectiles . in order to estimate the influence on the shape induced by the kinematical bounds we have constructed the correlation functions for both , the @xmath6 and @xmath54 reaction assuming a point - like source using a monte - carlo simulation .",
    "the results of the simulations are presented in figure  [ corr : mcexp ] ( open squares ) and it is apparent that they differ significantly from the experimental correlation function . at the origin the coulomb repulsion between protons brings the experimental correlation function down to zero .",
    "meson ( left panel ) and multi - pions with the invariant mass equal to the mass of the @xmath1 meson ( right panel ) .",

    "full squares denote the experimental data and open squares represent results of simulations determined for a point - like source assuming the homogeneous population of the phase space for the reaction products . [",
    "corr : mcexp],title=\"fig : \" ]    next , in order to extract from the experimental data the shape of the correlation function free from the influence of energy and momentum conservation we constructed a double ratio : @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the normalization constant , and indices exp and mc refer to the experimental and simulated samples , respectively .",
    "the determined double ratios are given in table  [ tabelka ] and presented in figure [ corr : double ] .",
    "the double ratio is a well established measure of correlations used e.g. by the aleph , opal and delphi collaborations for studying the bose - einstein or fermi - dirac correlations e.g. in the decays of z boson  @xcite or w - pairs  @xcite .      in figure  [ corr : double ] a significant discrepancy between the two - proton correlation functions determined from inclusive heavy ion reactions ( triangles )  @xcite and from exclusive proton - proton measurements ( full squares ) is clearly visible .",
    "the data from the kinematically exclusive measurement do not reveal a peak structure at 20  mev / c .",
    "although a similar enhancement is also seen in the invariant mass of the proton - proton distributions  @xcite it disappears in the correlation function for the @xmath57 and @xmath54 reactions .    at present it is not possible to draw a solid quantitative conclusion about the size of the system since e.g. in the case of the @xmath6 reaction it would require to solve a three - body problem where @xmath58 and @xmath59  @xcite interactions are not negligible and both contribute significantly to the proton - proton correlation .",
    "however , based on semi - quantitative predictions  @xcite one can estimate that the system must be unexpectedly large with a radius in the order of 4  fm .",
    "this makes the result interesting in context of the predicted quasi - bound @xmath60 state @xcite and in view of the hypothesis  @xcite that at threshold for the @xmath6 reaction the proton - proton pair may be emitted from a large borromean like object whose radius is about 4  fm .",
