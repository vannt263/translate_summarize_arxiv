    "we introduced the fundamental series of generalized harish - chandra modules ( or equivalently , @xmath0-modules of finite type over @xmath9 ) and proved that any simple generalized harish - chandra module with generic minimal @xmath9-type arises as the socle of an appropriate fundamental series module . using this result",
    "we were able to show that any simple generalized harish - chandra module with generic minimal @xmath9-type can be reconstructed from its @xmath10-cohomology .",
    "this led to a classification of generalized harish - chandra modules with generic minimal @xmath9-type .",

    ", we prove in section 2 that any fundamental series generalized harish - chandra module has finite length . in section 4",
    "we introduce the concepts of a strongly reconstructible and a weakly reconstructible simple generalized harish - chandra module .",
    "theorem 3 from @xcite implies that any simple harish - chandra module with generic minimal @xmath9-type is strongly reconstructible ; however our aim is to study strong and weak reconstructibility of simple generalized harish - chandra modules which do not necessarily have a generic minimal @xmath9-type .    from section 5 on",

    "we prove that for @xmath19 , the socle of the fundamental series module is isomorphic to @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the simple lowest weight module associated to the data @xmath22 .",

    ", the theory of the derived zuckerman functors yields an explicit formula for the @xmath9-character of the strongly reconstructible module @xmath20 .",
    "section 8 is devoted to examples .",
    "we consider six explicit pairs @xmath7 with @xmath23 and we compute the respective sharp bounds on @xmath24 which ensure that a simple @xmath7-module with minimal @xmath6-type @xmath11 is strongly reconstructible . for a principal @xmath6-subalgebra of @xmath25",
    "this sharp bound is the one established in the present paper , in the other five cases it turns out to be the bound from @xcite .    in the final section 9 we discuss the possibility that , for @xmath4 and a large enough @xmath26 , the functor @xmath27 is an equivalence between a certain category of @xmath28-finite modules @xmath29 and a category of @xmath0-modules @xmath30 . proving or disproving this statement is an open problem .",
