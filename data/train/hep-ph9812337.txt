    "<S> we analyze cp violation in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model with heavy scalar fermions of the first two generations . neglecting intergenerational mixing in the sfemion mass matrices and thus considering only chargino , charged higgs and w  boson diagrams we show that it is possible to fully account for cp violation in the kaon system even in the absence of the standard ckm phase . </S>",
    "<S> this opens new possibilities for large supersymmetric contributions to cp violation in the b system .    beginning with its experimental discovery in k  meson decays , about three decades ago </S>",
    "<S> , the origin of cp violation has been one of the most intriguing questions in particle phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> notably , the subsequent experiments in the search for electric dipole moments ( edm ) of the neutron and electron have observed no sign of new cp  violating effects despite their considerably high precision . </S>",
    "<S> however , this situation is expected to change in the near future with the advent of the new b factories . indeed , experimental studies of the neutral b  </S>",
    "<S> meson systems can provide a window to new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) much earlier than the direct collider searches at the lhc .    in the standard electroweak theory </S>",
    "<S> the cp  violating phenomena find their explanation uniquely in the phase @xmath0 of the cabibbo  kobayashi  </S>",
    "<S> maskawa mixing matrix ( ckm ) </S>",
    "<S> . however , in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) there are additional phases which can cause deviations from the predictions of the sm . indeed , after all possible rephasings of the parameters and fields there remain two new physical phases in the mssm lagrangian that can be chosen to be the phases of the higgsino dirac mass parameter ( @xmath1 $ ] ) and the trilinear sfermion coupling ( @xmath2 ) to the higgs , ( @xmath3 $ ] ) @xcite . in the absence of the strict universality , </S>",
    "<S> as is generally the case at low energies , each sfermion species has a distinct phase @xmath4 . in the presence of such cp  violating phases a natural question to be raised would be `` is it possible to account for the observed cp  </S>",
    "<S> violation only by supersymmetric effects ? '' .    </S>",
    "<S> the traditional answer to this question has always been negative because of the fact that the electric dipole moments of the electron and neutron constrain @xmath5 to be at most @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent studies have revealed new pathways to small enough edm s while allowing susy phases @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> methods of suppressing the edm s consist of cancellation of various susy contributions among themselves @xcite , non - universality of the soft breaking parameters at the unification scale @xcite , and approximately degenerate heavy sfermions for the first two generations @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we shall follow the last alternative and assume a general low energy susy model with heavy and almost degenerate sfermions for the first two generations . now </S>",
    "<S> the question at the end of the last paragraph takes a more specific form : `` in such a scheme , can @xmath8 and @xmath9 account for the experimental observation of cp violation with vanishing @xmath0 ? '' .    to investigate the answer to this question </S>",
    "<S> we follow a simplifying assumption , that is , we neglect all intergenerational mixings in the sfermion mass matrices . </S>",
    "<S> then , neutralino and gluino vertices are approximately flavor diagonal and these particles do not contribute to the flavor changing neutral current processes . under this assumption , </S>",
    "<S> all flavor mixing effects originate from the elements of ckm matrix , as in the sm . in this scenario , </S>",

    "<S> the first contribution is the usual sm while the other two are of susy origin . </S>",
    "<S> these three types of contributions are always present independently of the existence / absence of intergenerational mixings , and thus the results we present in this letter can be regarded as conservative limits on susy effects .    under the conditions mentioned above it turns out that    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> relevant new susy contributions to cp violation observables are only possible when the masses of the light chargino and stop are close to the @xmath14 mass ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , and @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   in such case , the answer to our question is definitely positive , @xmath18 and the corresponding observable in the b system , @xmath19 , get large contributions from susy that can even saturate the measured value for @xmath18 .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath20@xmath21 and @xmath22@xmath23 mixings are conveniently described by the corresponding @xmath24 effective hamiltonian @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the effective four  fermion operators with @xmath29 for the @xmath30 and @xmath31systems respectively , @xmath32 are color indices and @xmath33 the corresponding wilson coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> these are evaluated at the corresponding meson mass , @xmath34 , with the initial conditions specified at @xmath35 . without the inclusion of qcd corrections </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath36 receives no contribution from @xmath37 , charged higgs and chargino boxes , and the other two coefficients can be decomposed according to the particles in the loop as @xmath38 , @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions of @xmath40 boson , @xmath41 , and charged higgs , @xmath42 , are real .    </S>",

    "<S> the matrices @xmath46 and @xmath47 represent the coupling of chargino and stop to left and right  handed down quarks respectively . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen from eq.([chwc ] ) , unlike @xmath53 , @xmath54 depends on both @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and thus , in general , it is complex . on the other hand , unless one admits large enough @xmath55 values , @xmath56 becomes much smaller than @xmath57 since the former is suppressed by the ratio of @xmath58 to @xmath59 .    </S>",
    "<S> solution of rge s at the corresponding meson mass scale yield @xcite @xmath60 where the enhancement of the @xmath61 wilson coefficient is specially interesting .    with the complete expression of the @xmath62 effective hamiltonian , it is now a straightforward issue to analyze cp  violation observables . for both k and b  meson systems we follow the usual definition of the @xmath63 parameter factoring out global phases , @xmath64 where @xmath65 , and </S>",

    "<S> we can easily calculate the amount of indirect cp  violation in the k and b  systems . as eqs.([ek ] ) and ( [ m12 ] ) suggest @xmath77 gets contributions from two different sources : the usual ckm phase @xmath0 coming through @xmath78 , and the complex wilson coefficients , @xmath79 . while the former is the usual source of cp  violating phenomena in the sm the latter is completely a susy effect . </S>",
    "<S> in the following , we will _ always assume that there is no physical phase in the ckm mixing matrix , and cp violation is purely of supersymmetric origin_.    in first place we will analyze the @xmath30system where we have experimental confirmation of cp  violation . at first sight , one would completely neglect any susy contribution to @xmath80 because of the huge suppression factor associated with the @xmath81quark yukawa coupling in @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is not necessarily true for large @xmath83 ( with @xmath84 we get @xmath85 ) . besides this </S>",
    "<S> , we have additional enhancements from the hadronic matrix elements , @xmath86 and the rge evolution , eq.([rge ] ) . at this point </S>",

    "<S> 1 we show @xmath18 as a function of @xmath89 and @xmath90 for @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 which give on average @xmath95 and @xmath96 . as we can see in this figure , it is still possible to fully saturate the measured value of @xmath80 relying only on susy phases .    </S>",
    "<S> indirect cp  violation in the b  system can be analyzed in the same way from the @xmath97 effective hamiltonian , eq.([df=2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effects in the corresponding observable @xmath98 will increase roughly as @xmath99 with respect to @xmath80 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 we show @xmath98 as a function of @xmath89 and @xmath90 for the same region of susy parameter space that we used in the @xmath18 analysis . notice that for the set of values for which @xmath18 is fully saturated we obtain large effects for cp violation in the b system . in this system , </S>",
    "<S> the mixing  induced cp phase , @xmath100 , measurable in @xmath22 cp asymmetries , is related to @xmath19 by @xmath101 . for @xmath102 </S>",
    "<S> , it reaches the value @xmath103 which can be cleanly observed in the future b factories . even for smaller values of @xmath83 , </S>",
    "<S> for which @xmath18 is not entirely reproduced by susy effects , we still have quite sizeable susy contributions to cp violation in b mixing with appreciable deviations from the sm results @xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown in this letter that in a general susy extension of the sm with heavy scalar fermions of the first two generations it is possible to fully account for the observed cp violation in the kaon system . </S>",
