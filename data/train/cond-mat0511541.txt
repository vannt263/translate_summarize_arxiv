    "recently , a field - enhanced diamagnetism was found in the pseudogap state of bi2212 , which scales exactly like the nernst signal @xcite and further supports the vortex description for the loss of phase coherence at @xmath7 .",
    "all these experiments point towards a picture , where the pseudogap arises from phase fluctuations of the superconducting gap @xcite . in previous work @xcite",

    ", it was shown that a two - dimensional bcs - like hamiltonian with a @xmath11-wave gap and phase fluctuations , which were treated by a monte - carlo ( mc ) simulation of an @xmath12 model , yields results which compare very well with scanning tunneling measurements over a wide temperature range @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this phenomenological phase fluctuation model was also able to explain the `` violation '' of the in - plane optical integral in underdoped bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( bi2212 ) @xcite and the characteristic change of the quasiparticle dispersion observed in crossing @xmath0 in underdoped bi2212 samples @xcite .    here , we consider in detail two other experiments , which critically probe the phase - fluctuation scenario .",
    "the first one is the optical response .",
    "our calculations were , in particular , motivated by optical studies of the berkeley group @xcite . in this seminal work high - frequency",
    "optical response , i.  e.  the complex frequency dependent conductivity , was used to capture the short - time scale dynamics of the phase correlations .",
    "indeed , the pseudogap conjecture had early on led to an intensive search for normal state `` remnants '' of the sc state , such as the infinite d.  c.  conductivity . however , it was not before this corson et .",
    "work that it was realized that the short phase - correlation times require a high - frequency optical probe to make the conductivity enhancement over normal - state values observable .",
    "we give a detailed analysis of the temperature and frequency dependence of the optical conductivity @xmath13 within our phenomenological phase fluctuation model , which , for completeness , is reintroduced in section ii . in section [ paracon ] , we compare the calculated paraconductivity due to @xmath14-wave phase fluctuations above @xmath0 with the high - frequency conductivity experiments of ref .",
    ". salient features of these experiments are reproduced in @xmath15 above @xmath7 : at sufficiently high frequencies , the phase - fluctuating state becomes indistinguishable from the sc state . in this latter case",
    "@xmath16 , i.  e.  the imaginary part , shows the usual bcs - like behavior falling off as @xmath17 , with a prefactor being proportional to the phase - stiffness energy .",
    "this generates in our calculations a scaling behavior of @xmath18 , in agreement with experiment , in that all @xmath19 curves collapse onto a single curve at the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt)-temperature @xmath20 .",
    "since , in the phase fluctuation scenario , the pseudogap is due to phase fluctuations of the sc order parameter , one might ask , how much of the characteristic magnetic properties of a superconductor are still observable in the pseudogap state of the underdoped cuprates .",
    "these magnetic precursor effects of the ideal superconducting state are twofold .",
    "firstly , one would expect a form of fluctuating diamagnetism which partially screens an applied magnetic field already above @xmath0 .",
    "secondly , one would also expect that the paramagnetic spin ( or pauli ) susceptibility is reduced in a characteristic way below @xmath1 due to the formation of incoherent singlet - pairs , accompanied by the reduction of spectral weight at the fermi surface .    in experiment ,",
    "the fluctuation - induced diamagnetism is only important close to @xmath0 .",
    "since , at higher temperatures , the paramagnetic spin response is typically one - order - of - magnitude larger than the diamagnetic response , we concentrate here on the spin susceptibility @xmath21 .",
    "this latter quantity dominates the t - dependence of the paramagnetic susceptibility in the experiments .    in section [ mag ]",
    ", it is shown that the pauli spin susceptibility extracted from our phase - fluctuation model can qualitatively account for the observed paramagnetic properties over a wide range of temperatures in the pseudogap regime .",
    "section v , finally , presents a summary of our results .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the usual tight - binding operator of non - interacting electrons on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice , i.  e.   @xmath24 here , @xmath25",

    "@xmath30 denotes an effective nearest - neighbor hopping - term and @xmath31 is the chemical potential .",
    "the @xmath32 sum is over nearest - neighbor sites of the 2d square lattice . for simplicity of our minimal model , we set longer - ranged hoppings @xmath33 equal to zero .",
    "all calculations were done for 10 % doping , which corresponds to a typical underdoped cuprate situation .",
    "the second part of the hamiltonian @xmath34 contains a bcs - like @xmath14-wave interaction , which is given by @xmath35 with @xmath36 connecting site @xmath37 to its nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath38 stands for the strength of the effective next - neighbor @xmath11-wave pairing - interaction .",
    "the origin of this pairing interaction is not essential for the further calculation .",
    "it can be either of purely electronic origin , like spin fluctuations , or phonon mediated .",
    "the only important point is , that there exists an effective pairing interaction , that produces a finite @xmath11-wave gap amplitude as one goes below a certain temperature @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast to conventional bcs theory , we consider the pairing - field amplitude not as a constant real number , but rather as a complex quantity @xmath39 with a _ constant _ magnitude @xmath40 and a _ fluctuating _ bond - phase field @xmath41 . in order to get a description , where the _ center of mass _ phases of the cooper pairs are the only relevant degrees of freedom @xcite , the @xmath11-wave bond - phase field is written in the following way @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the _ center of mass _ phase of a cooper pair localized at lattice site @xmath44 .    to account for the proximity to the mott insulating state and thus the low superfluid density ,",
    "we perform a _ quenched average _ over all possible phase configurations with the statistical weight given by the classical @xmath12 free energy @xmath45 = - j \\sum_{\\langle ij\\rangle } \\cos\\left(\\varphi_i-\\varphi_j\\right ) .",

    "finally , we set @xmath48 , where we have the stm experiments of ref .   in mind , which corresponds to a large pseudogap regime .    in ref .  , the justification for using a minimal model and , in particular , the use of a classical @xmath12 interaction in eq .",

    "key ideas of the cuprate phase - fluctuation scenario , has been substantiated there by a detailed numerical solution and the fact that characteristic and crucial features of stm studies @xcite could be reproduced over a wide temperature range",
    ".    recent work on a bcs - hamiltonian with classical phase fluctuations can also be found in ref .  .",
    "in a conventional bcs superconductor , superconducting ( sc ) fluctuations with short - range phase coherence typically survive no more than @xmath49k above @xmath0 . within a phase fluctuation scenario for the underdoped cuprates , one would expect that pairing remains over a wide temperature range above @xmath0 , together with phase correlations which are of finite range in space and time @xcite .",
    "hence , although the system is in the normal state , signatures of the ideal sc state should still be observable considerably above @xmath0 , _ if _ the experiments probe short enough time scales . a likely candidate to observe these effects are high - frequency conductivity experiments .",
    "indeed , microwave conductivity experiments on underdoped bi2212 @xcite were able to track the phase - correlation time in the normal state up to @xmath50k above @xmath0 .",
    "these experiments show , that the sc transition is `` smeared out '' over a considerable temperature range , when viewed at high - enough frequencies ( short - enough time scales ) .",
    "the imaginary part of the conductivity finally disappears more than @xmath50k above @xmath51k and shows a superconducting scaling behavior already above @xmath0 .",
    "the real part of the conductivity displays a characteristic peak near @xmath0 at finite frequencies , on top of a `` background conductivity '' of normal conducting electrons .",
    "this peak was interpreted by the authors of ref .   as signature of the partially phase coherent electrons .",
    "all experiments were carried out with frequencies of a few hundred ghz , which corresponds to @xmath52 . in order to compare these experiments with our phase fluctuation model",
    ", some compromise has to be made , since finite - size effects become important below @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , we have chosen a set of frequencies @xmath54 , which are , on the one hand , much larger than @xmath55 , and on the other hand much smaller than the relevant energy scale , i.  e.  the sc gap size in our model ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "thus , in the following , one always should keep in mind that the frequency closest to experiment is @xmath57 .    the optical conductivity from our phase - fluctuation model , i.  e.   @xcite @xmath58 was obtained by averaging the matsubara current - current correlation function @xmath59   \\ } , \\label{mat_cc}\\ ] ] and the operator for the local kinetic energy in @xmath60-direction @xmath61 over all possible phase configurations using eq .",

    "the change of @xmath66 is more pronounced at lower frequencies .",
    "however , in our model the imaginary part does not go to zero in the normal state but rather converges towards a finite value .",
    "this is due to the missing quasiparticle scattering in the normal state in addition to phase - fluctuation caused scattering . in a `` real '' metal , above @xmath0 , the finite electronic scattering rate , strongly suppresses the imaginary part @xmath74 at low frequencies , so that it can be neglected .",
