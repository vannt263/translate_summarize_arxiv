    "helices are a common structural motif in biological molecules , from the @xmath0-helix in proteins to the culturally iconic double helix observed in double - stranded dna . in a living cell",
    ", the adoption of stable helical structures allows these molecules to place functional groups in specific positions and orientations , and holds the polymer backbone away from the solvent , protecting it from chemical attack .",
    "the consensus view of helix formation follows the work of pauling et al .",
    "@xcite ; biological helices are stabilized by orientationally - dependent hydrogen bonding , with their chirality arising from the chirality of the polymer molecule .",
    "those same properties which make helical molecules so useful in living cells also make them useful in the context of nanotechnology .",
    "unfortunately , while our understanding of biological helices is good at explaining why polypeptides and polynucleotides do form helices , it does not provide useful prescriptions for developing alternative helix - forming molecular architectures . to gain the understanding necessary to develop such prescriptions ,",
    "many workers have considered `` reduced models '' @xcite for helix formation , which attempt to capture the underlying physics of the phenomenon in as simple a manner as possible .    over recent years , simulation studies of such reduced models have yielded surprising results . in particular ,",
    "several polymer models have been proposed which produce helical structure while interacting via isotropic potentials @xcite ; that is , helix formation without `` designed - in '' preferred interactions , with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "maritan et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that helices are `` maximally compact '' structures for string - like objects .",
    "this suggests that helix formation arises from geometric symmetry breaking , akin to crystallization .",
    "a better understanding of how this symmetry breaking can arise should lead to the better prescriptions for helix - forming architectures .    in the study of @xmath0 helix formation in polypeptides ,",
    "the starting point is the observation that helices are quasi one dimensional objects , which can be looked at as a spin chain .",
    "the standard approach @xcite is to attribute amino acid residue conformations to spins , either h ( `` helix '' , that is , capable of forming a hydrogen bond compatible with a helical structure ) or c ( `` coil '' , otherwise ) . a spin chain representation",
    "is then made up of these states ; in the simplest form @xcite , residues which are neighbors along the peptide backbone interact according only to their h / c attribution and amino acid type .",
    "modern versions of this approach @xcite include many - body `` capping interactions '' , which are non - pairwise , non - local interactions between residues ; the strength of these interactions , however , still depends only upon the residue type and h / c attribution .",
    "such models have achieved considerable success in helical structure prediction for polypeptides . for more general helix - forming systems , the proper attribution of a backbone segment to `` h '' or `` c ''",
    "type is not clear .",
    "however , the success of the spin chain approach to helix formation in polypeptides suggest that a similar approach may be fruitful .    for a linear polymer of spherically symmetric monomers ,",
    "single monomers are not the equivalent of amino acid residues for helix formation , as they have no internal degrees of freedom . from symmetry arguments ,",
    "the minimum possible such building block must be a tetramer ; helices break chiral symmetry , and a tetramer is the shortest length chain which may exhibit chirality .",
    "similarly , the behavior of a pentamer should contain information on how neighboring chiral centers interact , and so forth for longer chains .    in this paper",
    ", we seek complete enumeration of the partition function for tetramers and pentamers , using a simple polymer model which has previously been shown to produce helices @xcite .",
    "this enumeration is performed using a methodology similar to that followed by taylor @xcite for short tangent square - well chains .",
    "the intention is to identify the building blocks necessary for helix formation in longer chains , and the origins of the behaviors which allow helix formation in longer chains .",

    "interactions between non - bonded monomers ( separation @xmath7 ) are given by an isotropic square - well potential :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the well width ( taken as 1.5 in this work ) , and the well depth @xmath10 sets the energy ( and hence temperature ) scale .",
    "we follow the protein literature , by denoting interactions between particles where @xmath11 as _ contacts _ , and interactions where @xmath12 as _ overlaps_. interactions between monomers separated by two bonds along the chain are referred to as 1 - 3 interactions ; interactions for monomers separated by three bonds are referred to as 1 - 4 interactions , and so forth .    in previous simulation work",
    ", we have used a version of this model where individual bond lengths were allowed to vary by @xmath13 .",
    "it has been suggested that such bond length variation can enhance the ergodicity of a simulation compared to rigid bonds @xcite ; further , this allows the configurational and momentum parts of the partition function to be factorized . with such bond length fluctuation ,",

    "[ fig : coresoftened ] ) , which have been used to study the anomalous behavior of water @xcite .",
    "these isotropic potentials have a shoulder ( diameter @xmath3 ) around a repulsive core ( diameter @xmath1 ) , representing close packed but non - hydrogen bonded pairs , and an outer well ( diameter @xmath16 ) which represents hydrogen bonding interactions . in a chain of such monomers with bond length",
    "@xmath1 , if the difference between the potential energy of the shoulder and the potential energy in the minimum is sufficiently larger than @xmath17 , the _ effective _ repulsive core diameter will be the shoulder diameter ; at low temperatures , a chain of such monomers would behave as the overlapping square well monomer model presented here , forming helical structure .",

    "this continues to the `` magic number '' @xmath151 , where , as for the tetramer , 1 - 4 overlaps can no longer occur , and steric effects no longer prevent _ cis _ conformations . as the degree of overlap tends to this number , and the amount of steric interference decreases , the maxima move closer to @xmath152 . for @xmath153 , the probability distributions become unimodal at @xmath152",
    "this should be compared with the behavior for the tetramer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : phimax ] ) , where @xmath154 is zero for @xmath155 ; this effect is due to the additional steric interference from 1 - 5 overlaps .",
    "in the previous section , it has been shown that the tetramer and pentamer show a rich and surprising range of behaviors . specifically , these are `` magic numbers '' of the overlap @xmath4 where the derivatives of the densities of states change discontinuously , maxima in specific heat with respect to temperature , and a region of bimodal energy probability distributions , reminiscent of a first - order transition in bulk systems . in general ,",
    "the behavior of long polymer chains can not be directly inferred from the behavior of very short chains such as those studied in this work . if , however , interactions between monomers widely spaced along a chain can be neglected , the behavior of very short chains can be used as a basis for a spin chain model .",
    "such interactions may be neglected when chains become very stiff ( at , for e.g. , large values of @xmath4 , or after helix formation ) . in this case , the behavior of the very short chains may be considered the `` building block '' for the behavior of longer chains .",
    "the `` magic numbers '' which are observed correspond to discontinuous changes in the derivatives of the densities of states . at @xmath122 ,",
    "1 - 3 contacts become `` always on '' and high energy densities of states become zero . at @xmath151 ,",
    "the chain becomes so stiff that it can not bend back upon itself far enough for 1 - 4 overlaps to occur .",
    "similarly , at @xmath125 , the chain becomes so stiff that 1 - 5 contacts can no longer occur , and the ground state for the pentamer is lost .",
    "these discontinuities in the densities of states are associated with discontinuities in the energy and compressibility with respect to the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the `` magic numbers '' are similar in principle to the `` cut - off '' @xmath9 values noted by taylor @xcite for tangent chains  this work has not examined the effects of changing the well width parameter @xmath9 , but it is obvious that the values of these `` magic numbers '' will depend upon that parameter , and that `` cut - off '' values of @xmath9 will also exist for this model . as has been noted above , the discontinuities across lines of constant @xmath4 in this system will be smoothed in simulations with variable bond length , however , the effects should still be visible .",
    "we particularly note the sudden loss of stability of the `` helix 1 '' phase at @xmath156 in previous simulation work @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : phdiag ] ) . given",
    "the 10% bond length fluctuation allowed in those simulations , this loss of stability may coincide with the magic number at @xmath157 , suggesting that the more tightly wound `` helix 1 '' phase is stabilized by steric interference of 1 - 4 contacts .",
    "this supposition is supported by the observed loss of double - peaked dihedral angle probability distributions for overlaps above this `` magic number '' , suggesting that the more loosely wound `` helix 2 '' phase is stabilized by steric interference between monomers spaced further along the chain .",
    "the low temperature maxima in the specific heat for these short polymers appear to be a continuation of the specific heat maxima observed for short tangent chains @xcite .",
    "we follow these previous works in interpreting these maxima as signatures of collapse to close - packed , low energy conformations .",
    "this interpretation appears confirmed by the presence of bimodal energy probability distributions for the pentamer , with a line of `` state coexistence '' which roughly parallels the line of maxima .    for the tetramer , the line of specific heat maxima shows re - entrance below @xmath122 , having a maximum with respect to temperature . for the pentamer ,",
    "both the line of specific heat maxima and of `` state coexistence '' are doubly reentrant , showing maxima below and above @xmath122 .",
    "the re - entrance of the `` state coexistence '' line can be easily explained by reference to the densities of states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5merdos ] . consider the system for @xmath158 .",
    "for overlaps just above this point , the ground state density of states ( the entropy of the low energy state ) is increasing while all other densities of states are decreasing with increasing overlap .",
    "hence , the low energy state becomes more stable , and coexistence moves to higher temperature .",
    "the ground state density of states soon begins to decrease , but as long as it is decreasing _ more slowly _ than the higher energy density of states , its stability continues to increase .",
    "however , on closer approach to @xmath125 , the ground state density of states decreases _ faster _ than the higher energy densities of states , and stability decreases .",
    "the same argument holds for the line when @xmath159 .",
    "if we interpret the maximum in heat capacity as a result of _ structural competition _ between the ground state and higher energy states ( following stanley , et al.@xcite ) , we can make the same argument for the re - entrance in the lines of maxima for both the tetramer and pentamer .",
    "physically , increasing the overlap of the chain makes configurations with lower energy ( more contacts ) more likely at first ( as monomers are `` drawn into '' each other s square wells ) , but then begins to cut into these low energy states as the chain becomes too stiff to bend back upon itself and make contacts .",
    "we attribute the re - entrance of the stability of the `` helix 1 '' phase in previous work to this same competition between effects .",
    "though it seems reasonable to attribute the behavior of the phase boundary between the `` helix 1 '' and globule phases to effects seen in the pentamer , it should be noted that the state coexistence seen in the pentamer is represents collapse of the pentamer , rather than helix formation .",
    "though the dihedral probability distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsphis ] do show double peaks at non - zero dihedral angles , this is not a sufficient criterion for helicity .",
    "the cross - correlation coefficient of these distributions is not significantly above zero ; the total statistical weight associated with dihedrals away from the peaks is still large enough to outweigh the correlated peaks .",
    "however , the clear double peaked structure does suggest that the physics necessary for helix formation _ is _ contained in these simple , small systems , particularly in the steric interference due to 1 - 4 overlaps .",
    "while these results appear to clarify certain behaviors observed in simulations , they do raise further questions . under the interpretation we have offered here ,",
    "the nature of the `` helix-2 '' phase is unclear ; this phase is observed to be stable up to @xmath160 in simulation @xcite , where the chain is too stiff for 1 - 5 overlaps to be the root of the observed chirality .",
    "further , the question of how the helix transition connects ( or does not connect ) to the crystallization - like transition observed in simulations for the tangent chain system remains unresolved .",
    "follow - up work , developing a spin chain model for helix formation using the results presented here , is underway ; it is hoped that this approach will shed light upon these questions ."
