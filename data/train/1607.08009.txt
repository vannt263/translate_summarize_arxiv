    "we present a mathematical model , based on differential equations , for the evolution of the primary tumor of _ metastatic colorectal cancer _ ( mcrc ) , before treatment and during the first line therapy based on _ 5-fluorouracil _ ( 5-fu ) with or without _ bevacizumab _ ( bv ) .",
    "the behavior quantitatively corresponds to known data in all phases of development , in particular concerning the prediction of _ progression free survival _ ( pfs ) .",
    "figure [ fig main ] illustrates a typical outcome :  the growth is initially exponential ( linear in log - scale for the number of cells ) , then depleted because proliferation is restricted to a boundary region , up to a size of the order of @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "then angiogenic cascade starts and slowly recovers a partial form of exponential increase .",
    "the size of @xmath0 @xmath2 is reached around 8 years , with an average duplication time around 100 days , although widely variable during this pre - clinical phase ; all these facts are coherent with available observations , as reported below with comparison with the literature .",
    "part of the primary tumor develops drug resistant mutation , also indicated in figure [ fig main ] .",
    "we assume that chemotherapy starts at a size around a few @xmath2 and administrated following a typical regimen of several cycles of 8 weeks .",
    "we investigate the effects of 5-fu alone or combined with bv ;  two typical outcomes of our model under treatment are given in figures [ fig solo fu ] and [ fig fu e bv ] .",
    "since we do not consider explicitly the growth of metastases and their impact on patient behavior , we assume we deal with those mcrc patients which have only one metastatic lesion , which therefore is presumably of moderate importance in size with respect to the primary tumor , and compare the results with this restricted population . with proper randomization of the model coefficients , which fulfill the general pre - clinical features described above , we get median pfs = 7.5 .",
    "under 5-fu , and median pfs = 9.3 . under 5-fu plus bv , in agreement with the phase ii trial of @xcite , restricted to patients with one metastatic disease site",
    "moreover , we compute kaplan - meier curves and get a result comparable with the literature . finally , we explore how the results vary with coefficients and speculate on some connections between these coefficients and certain prognostic factors , hinting at the possibility to develop further the model in the direction of a patient - specific tool for the evaluation of different therapies . summarizing ,",
    "the model is capable of reproducing both qualitatively and quantitatively the features of mcrc , and how these depend on certain therapies and possibly on certain factors , restricted to the cases when the primary tumor plays the major role .    in a subsequent work we shall investigate the modifications played by the explicit introduction of metastases , their growth , size at the time when therapy starts , impact on pfs computation .",
    "we have preferred to isolate the simplest case here because it may be modified to treat other types of cancer , due to its simplicity .",
    "moreover , the intricate connections of variables and coefficients must be understood step by step .",
    "another generalization we have in mind , which moreover has been the initial motivation of our study , is to investigate more complex therapies , as those summarized in @xcite .",
    "but again we feel it is necessary proceed step by step .",
    "obviously several mathematical models of tumor growth based on ordinary differential equations have been already developed in the literature and sometimes with the same aim as here , namely to recover or explain clinical data ; see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the example treated here however seems to be new .    the choice of pfs as a primary end point is due to the fact that the period between the beginning of the treatment and the time of disease progression is subject to rather uniform treatment conditions , in well defined trials , opposite to the subsequent phase where ad hoc treatments are often used .",
    "the choice of mcrc is due to the relative high degree of repetition in the observed clinical results . only under",
    "well defined treatment conditions and some degree of mechanicism in the tumor progression , there is hope at present to confine the phenomena to a few differential equations , with an acceptable degree of approximation .    our model of ordinary differential equations , described below in sections [ section model 1 ] , [ section model 2 ] , [ section model 3 ] ,",
    "is limited to a few variables like the number of normoxic - hence proliferating - cancer cells , the number of hypoxic cancer cells , the average density of _ vascular endothelial growth factor _ ( vegf ) and the average density of angiogenic network ; it is a sort of reduced and space - independent projection of more realistic models , based on partial differential equations , like the one of @xcite .",
    "chemotherapy based on 5-fu and addition of bevacizumab are incorporated as control functions , which modify the evolution of the tumor , following a standard schedule implemented by kabbinavar et al .",
    "@xcite , summarized below in section [ subsection regimen ] .",
    "the variability in the population is reproduced by randomization of certain parameters , see section [ section parameters ] and implementation of a monte carlo algorithm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the main numerical results are presented in section [ section results ] .",
    "several preliminaries are necessary , and they are listed in section [ section preliminaries ] .",
    "the details of the mathematical model are postponed to sections [ section model 1 ] , [ section model 2 ] , [ section model 3 ]  and appendix [ appendix ] .    where angiogenesis is expected to start and the first red star is that initial time .",
    "the second red star is when @xmath3cells are reached which should be close to 8 years . in the main picture ,",
    "blue line denotes total number of cancer cells , green line those having a drug resistant mutation .",
    "concerning parameters , their value for this simulation is given in the tables of sections [ subsect param free ] and [ subsect param therapy].,width=534,height=299 ]",
    "before we can summarize our numerical results , we have to introduce several notions and explain some preliminary facts .",
    "following @xcite , we investigate the case when mcrc patients are initially treated by 12 cycles of 5-fu ( plus folinic acid ) , each cycle being of 8 weeks with  5-fu administrated at the beginning of each one of the first 6 weeks of a cycle .",
    "we compare this regimen with the one based on 5-fu ( and folinic acid ) plus bevacizumab .",
    "this monoclonal antibody is given once every two weeks - also the last two weeks of the cycle .",
    "the particular regimen bevacizumab 5 mg / kg every 2 weeks will be denoted by bv5 and we refer only to it when experimental data are quoted . in the clinical trials , when tumor progression takes place , the first line therapy is interrupted and patients could receive any second line treatment , which however may vary and are thus less suitable for a mathematical modeling . hence we limit ourselves to a model of the 5-fu or 5-fu + bv5 regimen during the first - line therapy and measure pfs .",
    "let us denote by @xmath4 the total number of cancer cells of the primary tumor ( equal to @xmath5 , in the notations of sections [ section model 1]-[section model 3 ] ) . according to @xcite and recist criteria we start from time @xmath6 when therapy begins and register the number of cells every 8 weeks , namely at the end of each cycle",
    "; hence we consider @xmath7 at times @xmath8 weeks with @xmath9 .",
    "in other words , @xmath10 corresponds to the cell number at the beginning of the therapy , @xmath11 the number at the end of the first chemotherapy cycle , and so on .",
    "then we compute the minimum of these values , say @xmath12 and we compute @xmath13 for all @xmath14 .",
    "we finally look for the first @xmath15 such that @xmath16 : we declare that progression occurs and we set pfs = @xmath17 .",
    "the logic behind this formula is that the tumor diameter is increased more than 20% ( namely the radius is increased more than 20% , hence the volume is more than @xmath18 times the previous one , namely @xmath19 , whence @xmath20 ) .",
    "this rule is included in the set of recist  rules for pfs computation both in @xcite and @xcite .    for small tumors , before 2009",
    "@xcite nothing is explicitly prescribed with the understanding that when the tumor size is not measurable one can not declare any progression .",
    "after 2009 @xcite a more precise rule is imposed , which however is again subject to the precision level of instruments at that time and location . since",
    "our aim is not to reproduce with high fidelity the experimental data obtained at a certain time , but to give a model which capture the main features and numerical figures known in the literature , we do not apply these specific rules and use the general rule of 20% also for small tumors .      very often in the sequel we refer to typical numbers for the evaluation of @xmath4 , the number of tumor cells in the primary tumor . for this purpose ,",
    "we have chosen to idealize the cell diameter to @xmath21 which is a reasonable average of realistic values and has the advantage to produce more closely the correspondence @xmath22 we want to capture order of magnitudes and thus we prefer numerical simplicity to precision .",
    "the size of @xmath23 is often considered as a landmark of tumor development , a sort of threshold around which tumors become detectable .    similarly , @xmath24 is a typical order of magnitude of the largest avascular tumors . around @xmath25 @xmath1",
    "the angiogenic cascade starts , see @xcite .",
    "this translates in the range @xmath26 .",
    "recall also that values like @xmath27 cancer cells are considered incompatible with life and that the total number of cells in a human body is of the order of @xmath28 .",
    "translating available statistics ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite ) into number of cells , reasonable values of @xmath4 at the beginning of first - line treatment are of the order of @xmath29 cells .",
    "larger values like @xmath30 also occurs for the most advanced stages and smaller values like @xmath31 could also be considered having in mind people emerging from a surgery plus adjuvant therapy , who still have micro - lesion and require the treatment studied here since are known to be mcrc patients .",
    "colorectal cancer is among the slowest ones .",
    "the doubling time ( dt ) is somewhat controversial , for various reasons ; sometimes it is computed from metastatic lesions with the assumption that it should be similar ( see @xcite ) but this assumption is often not confirmed ;  sometimes it is directly computed from the primary tumor but using simplified exponential rules which do not take into account the different growth regimes . from the literature ( see for instance @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) dt of the order of 60 - 180 days seems possible ( also less and more ) . some authors ( see @xcite , @xcite ) claim that periods of the order of 8 years could be reasonable estimates of the time needed to reach @xmath3 cells and this result is not incompatible with the previous estimates of dt , up to some degree of approximation .",
    "we have chosen to impose roughly 8 years to our model to reach @xmath3 cells and we have computed an average dt of the order of 100 days , where by average we mean that we take into account the changes of speed of growth that our model has , we compute at every time the instantaneous doubling time and we average it .",
    "see figure [ fig dt ] .",
    "typical times of pfs are quite short in comparison .",
    "the median pfs under 5-fu treatment alone is 5.5 months in @xcite when evaluated over the whole set of patients , 7.26 when restricted to patients having only one metastatic disease site ( those which look closer to the conditions of the present model ) .",
    "see also @xcite and the review @xcite for the results of other trials , essentially similar .",
    "the variation in the population , from @xcite fig .",
    "2 , goes from say few months to 12 - 15 months , up to exceptions .",
    "when bevacizumab , precisely bv5 , is added to the therapy , there is an increase in pfs .",
    "the median from @xcite is 9.2 months both over the whole population and the restricted group having only one lesion ; results from @xcite and @xcite gives similar figures ( the last one slightly smaller , like 8.8 months ) .",
    "the variation in the population from @xcite fig .",
    "2 , for 5-fu + bv5 , goes from few months to 16 months , up to exceptions .",
    ".parameters of the model . [ cols= \" > ,",
    "< \" , ]     the new medians are 7.5 for 5-fu alone and 7.5 for 5-fu plus bv5 .",
    "the case with bv5 is worse values than the case of the full population , a result in the direction of those reported by @xcite figure 4 .",
    "the general rationale of our model construction has been to use a very small number of variables , with a clear biophysical meaning , simple but still preserving general main mechanisms of cancer growth .",
    "an indirect source of ideas has been for instance the work @xcite , based on much more sophisticated models , but highlighting the importance of proliferating versus hypoxic cells , vegf production and consequent angiogenic growth . obviously there already exist models with similar features in the literature , as quoted elsewhere in this work ; however we prefer to start from scratch with criticism and construct a model corresponding to a certain intuition of cancer growth .",
    "the quantities considered here are    * @xmath32 = number of drug - sensitive normoxic ( hence potentially proliferating ) cells * @xmath33 = number of drug - sensitive hypoxic cells ( they can not proliferate ) * @xmath34 = intensity of vegf field ( space average ) * @xmath35 = level of vascularization due to angiogenesis ( space average ) .",
    "we have in mind the primary tumor of a mcrc and simplify the structure of the family of its cells by this division in two classes , proliferating and hypoxic .",
    "the hypoxic cells produce vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) which triggers the development of new vasculature , the so called angiogenic cascade .",
    "we neglect details of the spatial structure and thus do not consider the position of cancer cells and the space - dependence of @xmath34 and @xmath36 .",
    "the qualification of drug - sensitive will become important later on when we introduce the class of drug - resistant cells .    for convenience ,",
    "we introduce also the total number of cancer cells :    * @xmath37 .",
    "there is however a further subdivision of cancer cells , in mutated and non mutated ;  but this is a second - level concept we describe below after some development of the model .",
    "let us now describe the differential equations satisfied by the previous quantities .",
    "we start from the general form ( see for instance @xcite p. 9",
    ") @xmath39 for the growth of cell number by proliferation and decay by cell loss .",
    "some models consider in detail only the growth by proliferation but the introduction of cell loss is very important for a good behavior of our model and it is certainly motivated by a real and relevant phenomenon , see for instance @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the growth has been limited to the normoxic cells , hence the term @xmath40 .",
    "the loss is more distributed :  there is apoptosis in the area of proliferating cells due to mutations which are detected by the cells ; there is apoptosis and necrosis in the area of poor oxygen level and nutrient supply .",
    "certainly these phenomena have different rates but at least the difference between the former and the latter can be absorbed in the coefficient @xmath41 :  if the loss , instead of being @xmath42 , is more carefully modeled as @xmath43 then@xmath44 with @xmath45 , @xmath46 , hence the form ( [ eq for n part 1 ] ) is still correct .",
    "the assumptions of the model are now in the structure of @xmath32 .",
    "we assume there are two classes of ( potentially ) proliferating cells :  those near the boundary of the tumor mass , and those not near the boundary but reached by the new vascular network produced by the angiogenic cascade . in order to have a simple formula for the boundary of the tumor ,",
    "we assume it has a spherical shape - this is true only approximately , for various reasons , including the complex geometry of real tissues and the rugosity of the surface , but we can not include these factors unless we go back to space - dependent models .    the contribution coming from the boundary of the spherical tumor , as explained in the appendix [ appendix ] , is given by@xmath47 where @xmath48 is the thickness of the boundary layer , measured in terms of number of cell diameters .",
    "we have devised this formula , based on geometrical considerations , to take into account the transition between an exponential growth and a slower growth when there is an internal part of the tumor which poorly proliferates due to lack of oxygen , nutrients and space .",
    "this formula is a variant of verhulst model , which has the form @xmath49 .",
    "see also the model of @xcite , which accounts for the transition described above .",
    "the contribution coming from those cells , in the complementary of the boundary layer , which are sufficiently angiogenized to be considered as normoxic , is given by@xmath50 where @xmath36 is the average level of vascularization defined above .",
    "thus our overall assumption on the structure of the normoxic family is that @xmath51 inserted in ( [ eq for n part 1 ] ) gives us the equation of growth of the primary tumor , as a function of @xmath36 and of the two constants @xmath41 and @xmath52 .",
    "the full equation is summarized below in section [ summary 1 ] .",
    "the equation for @xmath33 is simply@xmath53      the vegf field is produced by hypoxic cells and absorbed by endothelial cells .",
    "we have devised the following equation for the time - variation of @xmath34:@xmath54 the factor @xmath55 has the role to restrict @xmath34 in @xmath56 , where the choice of @xmath0 as maximal value of @xmath34 is conventional .",
    "the term @xmath57 is the natural one to describe absorption by endothelial cells - moreover , it will play a very marginal role in the sequel .",
    "the term @xmath58 for the description of vegf production by hypoxic cells is justified in the appendix [ appendix ] .      the equation for @xmath36 should incorporate the following features :     \\i ) @xmath35    \\ii ) the increment of @xmath36 depends on the existing amount @xmath36 itself and the amount of vegf @xmath34 .",
    "a simple form is@xmath59 where @xmath60 modulates the speed of reaction of @xmath36 to @xmath34 .",
    "the term @xmath61 has been added because for values of @xmath36 very close to zero - even equal to zero - the growth @xmath62 is not infinitesimal , but finite non zero , due to the presence of the pre - existing vasculature .",
    "we rather arbitrarily choose @xmath63 ( @xmath60 modulates the correct growth rate , given an arbitrary value of @xmath61 which uniquely serves to start correctly the angiogenic growth ) .",
    "the term @xmath64 corresponds to the fact that angiogenesis requires some degree of concentration of vegf .",
    "below such threshold no angiogenesis occur ;  or more precisely , a regression takes place , as described right now .",
    "we take , somewhat arbitrarily , @xmath65 .",
    "the previous form describes to a reasonable extent the growth of angiogenic vasculature .",
    "however , especially due to bevacizumab application , our model must describe well also the process of vasculature regression experience when vegf is suppressed .",
    "the bio - mechanical rule of regression is different from the one of accretion . indeed , when regression occurs , the more recent capillaries are still poor in structure - e.g. not so covered by pericytes - and are easily destroyed , in a short time ( of the order of a week ) compared with the long times of the overall process ( of the order of many years ) . on the contrary , the less recent angiogenic vasculature has already reached a certain level of stability and thus it regresses much slowly .",
    "we have devised , with some degree of approximation and of ad - hoc numerical trials , the following low for the regression:@xmath66 ( the solution is @xmath67 , hence decreases initially very fast and slower later on ) . we activate this rule only when @xmath68 . putting these two regimes together , our model of angiogenesis is@xmath69    other models of tumor growth with angiogenesis have been proposed in the literature , see for instance @xcite and the review in @xcite",
    ". the gross behavior in some regime may be relatively similar , but our choice proved to perform well to reproduce data .",
    "the system for @xmath38 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath36 in absence of therapy and neglecting the cell difference due to mutations is @xmath70 @xmath71@xmath72@xmath69 it depends on the constants @xmath73 .",
    "a typical realization of @xmath38 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath36 is given in figure [ fig main ] ( it includes also mutations , described below in section [ section model 3 ] ) .",
    "the time axis includes the time since the origin of the tumor , measured in months , for several years .",
    "the vertical axis for @xmath38 and @xmath33 is logarithmic .",
    "we denote by @xmath74 and @xmath75 the control functions corresponding to 5-fu and bevacizumab respectively , functions which are equal to zero when 5-fu and bv5 are not present in the tissue . to be precise",
    ", they describe the concentration of 5-fu and bv5 in the tumor tissue .",
    "two possible misunderstandings should be avoided :  i ) the controls @xmath74 and @xmath75 are not understood as the actions of drug administration , which are short in time like in the case of 5-fu in bolus ;  ii ) they correspond to drug concentration in the tumor tissue , not in plasma .",
    "concerning 5-fu , we keep into account two facts :  i ) cell kill by chemotherapy is faster than proliferation ; ii ) the concentration of 5-fu in the tissue decays exponentially in time .",
    "we use the form@xmath76 where the control function @xmath74 is equal to zero in every period of no 5-fu therapy ( the schedule of @xmath74 in different weeks is prescribed by the scheme described in section [ subsection regimen ] ) and is given by the following expression in every week of therapy@xmath77 at the beginning of the week , when 5-fu is given in bolus , the rate is equal to@xmath78 hence the constant @xmath79 acts as a multiplier of intensity of cell kill with respect to cell proliferation .",
    "a typical value we use is @xmath80 .",
    "the expression inside the exponential has the following motivation : at time @xmath81 , we have @xmath82 , hence the rate at that time is @xmath83 . in other words , prescribing the number @xmath84 of days of action of 5-fu , we prescribe that cell loss occurs until time @xmath84 , in an exponentially decreasing manner ;  and afterwords proliferation restarts but not immediately with full rate @xmath41 , just with rate @xmath85 which is asymptotic to @xmath41 for large times .",
    "the schedule of bevacizumab is also prescribed in section [ subsection regimen ] ; recall it is given once every two weeks in each cycle . in the periods of no treatment , @xmath86 . under treatment , we impose that its half - life is @xmath87 , hence the form is @xmath88 the concentration @xmath75 , which acts on vegf , enter the equations in the form @xmath89    to summarize , beyond the already used constants @xmath73 , the controlled equations depend on the constant @xmath90 and the functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 depend on the additional parameters @xmath91 @xmath92 .",
    "typical realizations of @xmath38 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath36 under use of both 5-fu and bevacizumab are shown in figures [ fig solo fu ] and [ fig fu e bv ] .",
    "the essential drawback of the previous model is that under a continuous , not ending , therapy the fate is `` deterministic '' : either the response to therapy is good and thus the health improves indefinitely , or it is not good from the beginning and the health deteriorates in a constant way . in reality , for mcrc patients , the common case is that initially the therapy has a positive effect , the size of the tumor decreases , but then it deteriorates .",
    "the reasons for deterioration are of different kind , including for instance side effects and problems due to metastases . here",
    "we apply in the strongest way our general choice to simplify the model as much as possible and thus consider only one of such reasons , with the hope that the others have similar effects and do not change too much the statistics .",
    "the reason of deterioration we take into account is the presence of drug - resistant mutations .",
    "they are of several form and may appear before the beginning of the therapy - intrinsic drug resistance - or after , as a consequence of the therapy - acquired drug resistance ;  see @xcite , @xcite for reviews ; see also @xcite chapter 16 .",
    "we simplify and prescribe that each cancer cell , during a duplication , has a probability @xmath93 of developing a drug - resistant mutation .",
    "we introduce two new quantities :    * @xmath94 = number of drug - resistant mutated cells * @xmath95 = number of normoxic drug - resistant mutated cells * @xmath96 = number of hypoxic drug - resistant mutated cells .",
    "the full population of cancer cells is thus made of @xmath5 cells , of which @xmath97 are hypoxic .",
    "a precise rule of growth of the of the two subpopulations @xmath98 would be quite intricate and depending on the relative geometry .",
    "indeed , the approximation of a spherical shape can not work simultaneously for both , since they are interlaced .",
    "let us distinguish before and after treatment .    before treatment , @xmath99",
    ", hence the sphere approximation for drug - sensitive is reasonable and we do not modify the equations above for @xmath38 due to the introduction of mutated cells ( to be precise , there is a minor modification described below , numerically inessential ) .",
    "but drug - resistant cells are distributed , inside the tumor mass , in a quite complex way .",
    "somewhere we expect to see kernels of drug - resistant cells due to a first mutated cell together with its descendants ;  however , this kernel can not proliferate indefinitely as the global tumor mass because it is partial or completely absorbed into the deeper , hypoxic region .",
    "due to mutations , several new drug - resistant cells appear in the proliferating boundary , each one giving origin to a new kernel of cells .",
    "all these kernels have a similar fate as the one previously described , with different degrees of deepness , hence proliferating opportunity .",
    "it seems impossible to be accurate at this modeling level : here it is one case where a space - distributed particle system could be more realistic . in order to `` close '' our equations , we conjecture that the `` proliferating boundary '' - this concept itself is questionable , only portions of the boundary are sufficiently exposed to nutrients to proliferate - of the drug - resistant cells is thinner than the case of sensitive cells .",
    "for this reason we introduce a new constant @xmath100 .    after treatment ,",
    "the approximation as two separate spheres becomes more reasonable , since mutated kernels of cells may remain isolated by the loss of surrounding non - mutated cells and , again to simplify , we assume that the drug - resistant mass is dominated by the largest kernel of mutated cells , so the approximation as a single sphere is not too distant from reality . in this case",
    "we thus take @xmath101 .",
    "a second peculiarity of mutated cells is that , when the probability of mutation and the number of proliferating cells reach values which trigger the emergence of a first mutated cell , soon others will appear and soon much more ( not due to proliferation of existing mutated cells ) ;  the number which determines this transition in a small time interval @xmath102   $ ] roughly is @xmath103 because @xmath104 is the number of proliferating ( mother ) cells in @xmath105   $ ] , and the average number of them which mutates is the product , @xmath106 ; fluctuations are relatively small , at least for large values of @xmath107 .",
    "thus the average number of mutated descendants is @xmath108    we should not forget that these arguments are true when proliferation freely takes place ;  under chemotherapy certain proliferating cells are killed .",
    "we thus correct the previous formula as@xmath109 to describe this dichotomy . to summarize , the equation for @xmath94 is@xmath110 where@xmath51 the mechanism of mutation is like a change of species , with doubling of the quantity in arrival . as in all change of species equations",
    ", we have to delete the same quantity from the delivering population , hence we have to correct the equation for @xmath38 as@xmath111 ( but @xmath112 in our numerical example ) .",
    "in addition we have @xmath113 and we modify the equation for vegf as@xmath114 the term @xmath115 has been replaced by @xmath116 because this is the new proportion of hypoxic cells over the full family .    in all figures above mutated cells",
    "are represented in green .",
    "in the sequel we argue at some time instant @xmath118 and drop the index @xmath118 .",
    "we assume the tumor occupies a spherical region or radius @xmath119 and we assume that only the external layer of thickness @xmath120 proliferates , in absence of angiogenesis .",
    "we assume cells have a roughly spherical shape of radius @xmath121 and fill in the whole sphere , so the total number of cells in the spherical tumor is @xmath122    recall equation ( [ eq for n part 1 ] ) ;  we have to explain why @xmath123 is given by the two contributions of formulae ( [ contrib layer ] ) and ( [ contrib angio ] ) ;  let us call here @xmath124 and @xmath125 these two contribution .",
    "the external layer of thickness @xmath120 has volume@xmath126 .",
    "we assume this volume is fully occupied by cells , each one of volume @xmath127 .",
    "hence the number @xmath124 of cells in the layer is@xmath128 let us consider two extreme regimes :  when the tumor is very small , @xmath129 .",
    "when the tumor is very large , we assume @xmath120 stabilizes to a certain number @xmath48 of cell diameters , hence @xmath130 . therefore@xmath131{cc}1 & \\text{when } n\\text { is small}\\\\ 2\\eta / n^{1/3 } & \\text{when } n\\text { is large}\\end{array } \\right .   .\\ ] ] a simple function which interpolates these two extremes is@xmath132 thus we arrive to the formula@xmath133 namely ( [ contrib layer ] ) .",
    "when the tumor is large , namely when @xmath134 , we have @xmath135 this is why we call this formula the @xmath117-formula for external layer of proliferating cells .",
    "the @xmath117 law appears often in the literature , see for instance @xcite and references therein .",
    "let us now discuss the contribution given by angiogenesis .",
