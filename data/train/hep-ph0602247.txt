    "central exclusive diffractive processes offer an excellent opportunity to study the higgs sector at the lhc in an exceptionally clean environment ; for recent reviews see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the process we have in mind is @xmath4 where the + signs denote large rapidity gaps .",
    "demanding such an exclusive process ( [ excl ] ) leads to a small cross section @xcite . at the lhc",
    ", we predict @xmath5 in spite of this , the exclusive reaction ( [ excl ] ) has the following advantages :    * the mass of the higgs boson can be measured with high accuracy ( with mass resolution @xmath6 gev ) by measuring the missing mass to the forward outgoing protons , _ provided _ that they can be accurately tagged far away from the interaction point . such a measurement can be done irrespective of the decay mode , and is at the heart of an lhc proposal @xcite to complement the central detectors by forward proton taggers in the 420 m region from the interaction point . *",
    "the leading order @xmath7 qcd background is suppressed by the p - even @xmath8 selection rule @xcite , where the @xmath9 axis is along the direction of the proton beam .",
    "therefore one can consider the observation of a standard model higgs boson via @xmath10 , which is the main decay mode for a mass @xmath11 gev .",
    "moreover , a measurement of the mass of the decay products must match the ` missing mass ' measurement .",
    "it should be possible to achieve a signal - to - background ratio of the order of 1 .",
    "for an integrated lhc luminosity of @xmath12 we expect about a dozen or so observable events for a standard model higgs , _ after _",
    "accounting for signal efficiencies and various cuts . * the quantum numbers of the central object ( in particular , the c- and p - parities ) can be analysed by studying the azimuthal angle distribution of the tagged protons @xcite . due to the selection rules ,",
    "the production of @xmath13 states is strongly favoured .",
    "* there is a very clean environment for the exclusive process  the soft background is strongly suppressed . * extending the study to susy higgs bosons , there are regions of susy parameter space were the signal is enhanced by a factor of 10 or more , while the background remains unaltered .",
    "indeed , there are even regions where the conventional inclusive higgs search modes are suppressed , whereas the exclusive diffractive signal is enhanced , and even such that both the @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xmath13 bosons may be detected @xcite .",
    "the basic mechanism for the exclusive process , @xmath16 , is shown in fig .",
    "@xmath17(a ) . the left - hand gluon @xmath18 is needed to screen the colour flow caused by the active gluons labelled by @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath21-integrated cross section is of the form @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the @xmath21-slope of the proton - pomeron vertex , and the constant @xmath24 is known in terms of the @xmath25 decay width .",
    "the factor , @xmath26 , is the probability that the rapidity gaps survive against population by secondary hadrons .",
    "it has been omitted ( @xmath27 ) in fig .",
    ". we will consider it in a moment . the amplitude - squared factor , @xmath28 , however , may be calculated using perturbative qcd techniques , since the dominant contribution to the integral comes from the region @xmath29 .",
    "the probability amplitudes , @xmath30 , to find the appropriate pairs of @xmath21-channel gluons ( @xmath31 ) and ( @xmath32 ) , are given by the skewed unintegrated gluon densities at a _ hard _",
    "scale @xmath33 .    .",
    "the presence of sudakov form factors ensures the infrared stability of the @xmath34 integral over the gluon loop in diagram ( a ) .",
    "it is also necessary to compute the probability , @xmath35 , that the rapidity gaps survive soft and semi - hard rescattering ; the two possible types of contributions are shown in diagrams ( c ) and ( d ) respectively , where the dashed lines represent pomeron exchanges ( as in version ( b ) of diagram ( a ) ) . in addition to diagram ( d ) , there is a ` mirror - imaged ' enhanced diagram with the additional pomeron instead being emitted from the upper proton , and an enhanced diagram with additional pomerons being emitted from both protons and coupling to intermediate partons of the other proton .",
    "the expectation is that diagram ( c ) gives @xmath36 at the lhc , whereas in the text we argue that the enhanced diagrams do not give a significant contribution.,height=566 ]    since the momentum fraction @xmath37 transferred through the screening gluon @xmath18 is much smaller than that ( @xmath38 ) transferred through the active gluons @xmath39 , it is possible to express @xmath40 in terms of the conventional integrated density @xmath41 .",

    "the factor @xmath43 accounts for the single @xmath44 skewed effect .",
    "it is found to be about 1.4 at the tevatron energy and about 1.2 at the energy of the lhc .",
    "note that the @xmath30 s embody a sudakov suppression factor @xmath45 , which ensures that the gluon does not radiate in the evolution from @xmath34 up to the hard scale @xmath33 , and so preserves the rapidity gaps .",
    "the sudakov factor is @xcite @xmath46\\right),\\ ] ] with @xmath47 .",
    "the square root arises in ( [ eq : a61 ] ) because the ( survival ) probability not to emit any additional gluons is only relevant to the hard ( active ) gluon .",
    "it is the presence of this sudakov factor which makes the integration in ( [ eq : m ] ) infrared stable , and perturbative qcd applicable .",
    "in fact , the @xmath45-factors have been calculated to _ single _ log accuracy @xcite .",
    "the collinear single logarithms may be summed up using the dglap equation . to account for the ` soft ' logarithms ( corresponding to the emission of low energy gluons ) the one - loop virtual correction to the @xmath48 vertex",
    "was calculated explicitly , and then the scale @xmath49 was chosen in such a way that eq.([eq : a71 ] ) reproduces the result of this explicit calculation .",
    "it is sufficient to calculate just the one - loop correction since it is known that the effect of ` soft ' gluon emission exponentiates .",
    "thus ( [ eq : a71 ] ) gives the @xmath45-factor to single log accuracy .",
    "now we discuss the rapidity gap survival factor , @xmath26 .",
    "it has been calculated using an eikonal model which embodies all the main features of soft diffraction . a schematic diagram is shown in fig .",
    "@xmath17(c ) .",
    "the additional pomeron may couple the upper and lower proton lines in all possible configurations .",
    "it is found to be @xmath50 for @xmath16 at the lhc .",
    "the uncertainty in the eikonal evaluation of @xmath26 has been estimated to be @xmath51 @xcite . in this connection",
    "it is interesting to note that an alternative determination , based on a monte carlo calculation , also yields @xmath52 at the lhc @xcite .",
    "a review of the various determinations of @xmath35 , showing general agreement , can be found in @xcite .",
    "moreover the value @xmath53 was found in the recent study described in @xcite , where the amplitude shown in fig .",
    "@xmath17(a ) was denoted tpf ( two pomeron fusion ) .",
    "actually the exclusive cross section is proportional to the factor @xmath54 , which is almost constant in the relevant interval @xmath55",
    "gev@xmath56 @xcite , where @xmath23 is the @xmath21-slope of the proton - pomeron vertex .",
    "besides the uncertainties in the gap survival factor @xmath26 caused by the soft eikonal rescattering of the incoming ( outgoing ) protons there is the possibility of an additional effect .",
    "the gap may be filled by the secondaries created in the rescattering of the intermediate partons ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "formally this effect is described by the semi - enhanced ( and/or enhanced ) reggeon diagrams .",
    "one such diagram vertex .",
    "this integration enhances the contribution of the given graph ( rather than the whole amplitude ) by an extra logarithm , arising from the available space in rapidity .",

    "semi - enhanced diagram _ , whereas an _ enhanced diagram _ contains two @xmath57 vertices and hence two integrations over their rapidities . ] is shown schematically in fig .",
    "@xmath17(d ) . since the intermediate gluons have a relatively large transverse momenta , there a possibility that the contribution may be evaluated within the framework of perturbative qcd .",
    "it is proportional to the qcd coupling @xmath58 times the density of gluons , generated by the lower proton in the rapidity interval occupied by the intermediate partons of the upper proton , that is @xmath59 . here",
    "@xmath60 and @xmath61 are the momentum fraction of the lower proton and the transverse momentum carried by the @xmath21-channel gluon in the upper cell of the gluon ladder corresponding to the additional pomeron in fig .",
    "@xmath17(d ) .",
    "note that @xmath60 can become very small , @xmath62 .",
    "the first detailed attempt to calculate such a contribution within the perturbative qcd framework has been performed in ref.@xcite .",
    "they evaluated an amplitude of the form is defined slightly differently to that in ref.@xcite . ]",

    "their result was that the enhanced diagrams give a rather large ( negative ) correction to exclusive higgs boson production at the lhc energy .",
    "that is the exclusive higgs signal may be significantly reduced .",
    "however the computation of the enhanced diagrams has , itself , many unresolved uncertainties .",
    "_ first _ , the next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) corrections to the triple - pomeron vertex are not known at present .",
    "to see the possible effect that these could have , we note that in the original reggeon phenomenological calculations a `` threshold '' was usually introduced , such that the rapidity interval between two reggeon vertices must exceed @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "an analogous effective repulsion between the two vertices of gluon emission has also been observed in the calculation of the nll bfkl corrections @xcite .",
    "the nll correction , @xmath65 , to the intercept of the pomeron trajectory is such that @xmath66 where @xmath67 , and where @xmath68 is the lo bfkl result .",
    "it turns out that the major part of this nll correction is of pure kinematical origin @xcite . on the other hand , in the presence of the `` threshold '' @xmath69 we have a behaviour exp@xmath70 where the intercept is given by @xcite @xmath71 thus , if we assume that the whole nll correction is explained by the @xmath69 threshold , then , on comparing the decrease of the intercept given by ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) , we obtain the value @xmath72 which is very close to that coming from the original regge phenomenology .",
    "if , indeed , the nll correction to the triple - pomeron vertex has the form of a @xmath73 threshold , then it follows that the semi - enhanced correction will only contribute when the rapidity interval is the proton momentum fraction carried by the higgs boson . ]",
    "@xmath74 between the incoming proton and the vertex of higgs boson emission becomes larger than @xmath75 ; since the interval between the rapidity of the triple - pomeron vertex ( @xmath76 ) and the proton , and the interval between the triple - pomeron and higgs vertices , both must exceed @xmath69 .",
    "that is , we must have @xmath77 if we impose these requirements , then the semi - enhanced correction ( considered in @xcite ) will not contribute significantly to the central ( @xmath78 ) exclusive production of a higgs boson of mass @xmath79 gev at the lhc energy @xmath80 tev , since the available rapidity interval @xmath81 is less than @xmath75 .",
    "even for @xmath82 gev the available phase space is minute .",
    "secondly _ , at the moment there are no experimental data which determine the partons in the region with @xmath83 .",
    "there is a tendency that at low @xmath84 gev@xmath85 and @xmath86 for the gluon density to start to decrease with @xmath38 decreasing @xcite .",
    "moreover , in some global analyses the gluon distribution is even negative for @xmath87 gev@xmath85 and @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "a more detailed discussion of our present knowledge ( and uncertainties ) of the low-@xmath38 parton distributions can be found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "_ finally _ , we recall that infrared stability of the calculation of is _ only _ provided by the so - called ` saturation momentum ' @xmath89 , below which the unintegrated gluon density @xmath30 becomes proportional to @xmath90 .",
    "that is @xmath91 indeed , the dimension of the pomeron loop @xmath92 integration is compensated by the infrared - type integral @xmath93 . here",
    "the infrared divergency is not protected by sudakov factors , and the infrared cutoff is provided either by the inverse proton size or by the saturation momentum @xmath94 .",
    "( and @xmath61 ) are much smaller than the value of the gluon transverse momenta @xmath95 in the loop which contains the higgs ( @xmath48 ) vertex , we can justify the validity of the same leading order ( lo ) p - even , @xmath8 selection rule as in the original amplitude , fig .",
    "@xmath17(a ) , without the semi - enhanced correction . ]",
    "the hope is that at very low values of @xmath60 the momentum @xmath89 is large enough for perturbative qcd to be applicable .",
    "this is not excluded ; however so far there is no experimental evidence ( in the hera data ) to show the explicit growth of @xmath96 with decreasing @xmath38 .",
    "thus the size of the correction crucially depends on the gluon density in the saturation ( or , even , the infrared ) region .",
    "the problem is that there is no established theoretical procedure to calculate the parton densities in this region , where many other more complicated multi - pomeron graphs , not accounted for in the bk - equation , become important . in particular",
    ", the interactions between the gluons from two parallel ` pomeron - ladders ' are already not negligible at much lower hera energies @xcite",
    ". clearly the series alternates in sign . the second enhanced correction with two pomeron loops",
    "gives a positive contribution , and so on . this is why the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite wrote that `` we can not consider our results as representing a reliable numerical final answer '' . moreover ,",
    "note that in @xcite , just the first semi - enhanced reggeon graph was considered .",
    "it was demonstrated by abramovsky @xcite that the inclusion of more complicated reggeon diagrams may strongly diminish the effective value of the triple - pomeron vertex . in particular , it is found that including graphs with one and two extra pomerons reduces the effective value of the triple - pomeron vertex @xmath57 by a factor of 4 @xcite .        from the formal point of view , if we work perturbatively and include only the first reggeon diagrams , we can estimate the importance of the semi - enhanced correction by relating the ratio of the contributions to exclusive higgs production , @xmath97(fig .  [",
    "fig : h](d))/@xmath97(fig .",
    "[ fig : h](b ) ) , to the ratio @xmath98 . here",
    "@xmath99 and @xmath100 are the total and single diffractive dissociation cross sections respectively , as computed from fig .",
    "[ fig : sd ] .",
    "we see that we have the ratios of equivalent regge diagrams .",
    "however , in the first ratio we need to include an agk factor @xcite of 4 ; one factor of 2 since the higgs boson may be emitted from either the left or right pomeron in fig .  [",
    "fig : h](d ) , and another factor of 2 as the cross section is given by the square of the amplitude .",
    "thus in terms of the simplest regge diagrams we obtain  =  4   ( )  0.1 at the lhc , where the ratio in brackets is to allow for the different rapidity intervals available for the triple - pomeron vertex , @xmath57 .",
    "the numerical evaluation of 0.1 is obtained using @xmath101 mb @xcite , @xmath102 mb , is observed@xcite to be already practically independent of energy by @xmath103 gev . ]",
    "ln@xmath104 and ln@xmath105 for the lhc energy .",
    "this estimate of the size of the semi - enhanced contribution is much less than that given in @xcite .",
    "the arguments employed in this paragraph , and in @xcite , are based on perturbative estimates using the simplest reggeon graphs , whose validity is questionable close to the saturation regime .",
    "the true parameter of the perturbative series is not the qcd coupling @xmath106 , but the probability of additional interactions , which however tends to 1 as the saturation region is approached .",
    "let us discuss this in more detail .",
    "note that , starting from perturbative theory , we arrive in the strong coupling regime .",
    "the main contribution comes from the rescattering of partons with low @xmath107 , that is from the region where the probability of rescattering is of the order of 1 .",
    "so we must consider the possibility of double counting .",
    "indeed the calculation of the `` soft '' survival factor , @xmath35 , in @xcite used the phenomenological @xmath108-amplitude obtained from fitting to `` soft '' data .",
    "this amplitude , shown by the left vertical line in fig .",
    "@xmath17(c ) , already includes the enhanced reggeon diagrams like that shown in fig .",
    "@xmath109 ; that is it accounts for the rescattering of the whole proton wave function including all the intermediate and `` wee '' partons .",
    "thus we do not need to consider the contribution of fig .",
    "@xmath17(d ) , but instead the _ difference _ between the enhanced contributions to exclusive higgs production and the enhanced corrections hidden in the _ phenomenological _ soft @xmath108-amplitude . here",
    "we may appeal to the good - walker approach @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , we expect that the component of the proton wave function , which contains the higgs boson , will have smaller size and a smaller number of wee partons than in a normal proton .",
    "the probability of a soft rescattering for this component is , most probably , smaller , that is the gap survival factor is larger , than that calculated using the `` experimental '' elastic @xmath108-amplitude .",
    "so , contrary to ref .",
    "@xcite , we may find that the corrections from the enhanced diagrams could even enlarge the predicted exclusive higgs cross section .",
    "however the probability of a soft rescattering is mainly driven by the spatial distribution of the valence quarks , so we do not expect the effect to be large ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    we conclude that there are theoretical and phenomenological reasons why the semi - enhanced corrections are expected to be small at lhc energies , and will not appreciably affect the estimates , outlined in section 2 , obtained for the cross section of the exclusive process @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , first , the correction comes from the ` saturation ' ( or even the infrared ) region , where the global parton analyses which include the low @xmath38 hera structure function data , show that , at low @xmath110 , the gluon density decreases as @xmath38 decreases below @xmath111 .",
    "moreover , the concept `` gluon density @xmath112 '' is not well defined in the saturation domain .",
    "when we enter the strong coupling regime of saturation we have to rely more on phenomenological arguments .",
    "one of these is the ` @xmath69 ' threshold effect , which arises from the nll correction to the triple - pomeron vertex ; it is expected to strongly suppress the correction when @xmath113 .",
    "however there is a more direct way of checking the smallness of the semi - enhanced hard rescattering correction . to this",
    "we now turn .",
    "there is a good way to experimentally probe the importance of the semi - enhanced rescattering correction .",
    "it is the observation of leading neutron production in inelastic events at hera , in which the neutron is measured with feynman @xmath38 in the region @xmath114 .",
    "this process , @xmath115 , is mediated by pion exchange .",
    "the gap corresponding to pion exchange may be filled by the secondaries produced in the rescattering of intermediate partons , in exact analogy with the case of exclusive higgs production . due to",
    "the relatively large values of the momentum fraction ( @xmath116 ) transferred across the gap , here the rapidity interval available for the triple - pomeron vertex is already large enough at hera energies . since the whole correction , after the integration over the rapidity of the triple - pomeron vertex , is proportional to the available rapidity interval , which grows with the initial photon energy , one has to expect that the probability to observe a leading neutron ( that is to observe a gap ) must fall down with energy .",
    "however this is not observed experimentally .",
    "the leading neutron data can be found in @xcite-@xcite , and a detailed analysis and discussion of the data is given in @xcite .",
    "these hera data show a flat dependence on the incoming photon energy ; see , for example , figs .",
    "7 of @xcite , and tables 14 , 18 and figs .",
    "11 , 12 of @xcite which show , for fixed @xmath110 , the same probability , to observe the rapidity gap associated with pion - exchange . ] to observe a leading neutron for values of @xmath117 which decrease by more than an order of magnitude corresponding to an increase of the photon laboratory energy by more than a factor of 10 .",
    "the flat behaviour provides a strong phenomenological argument in favour of a _ small _ semi - enhanced correction .",
    "soon there will be another way to check experimentally the role of the semi - enhanced rescattering corrections .",
    "that is from the measurements of exclusive @xmath118 production , @xmath119 , at the tevatron , and subsequently at the lhc where large @xmath118 masses should be accessible .",
    "three candidate events have already been observed in run ii at the tevatron @xcite . these hint at a cross section that is even larger than that predicted by a calculation @xcite based on a similar mechanism to that described in section 2 , that is without the semi - enhanced correction .",
    "recall that the estimate of the correction in @xcite significantly reduces the size of the exclusive cross section .",
    "these tevatron data are preliminary , and we await definitive measurements over a range of masses of the @xmath118 system .",
    "in particular , if measurements of @xmath118 production with @xmath120 gev were available , it should be possible to confirm the prediction for the exclusive production of a sm higgs with @xmath121 gev to the order of @xmath122 .",
    "moreover , if we account for the nlo corrections to @xmath123 then the uncertainty could be reduced to @xmath124",
    "the prediction for the cross section of central exclusive diffractive production of new heavy objects at the lhc is very important . in particular",
    ", the higgs production process @xmath0 offers many advantages for experimentally probing the higgs sector , and , indeed , in some regions of susy parameter space can even be the higgs discovery mode .",
    "the expected signal - to - background ratio is promising , but the event rate ( at least for a standard model higgs ) is low .",
    "it is therefore crucial to check the existing predictions .",
    "one recent check was carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "the basic ingredients of the calculation outlined in section 2 were confirmed .",
    "however the authors of @xcite went a step further .",
    "their aim was to quantify the possible importance of the so - called enhanced diagrams .",
    "indeed , they calculated these contributions perturbatively and came to the conclusion that they could be significant , and could reduce the predicted event rate , although they drew attention to the limited validity of perturbative procedure .",
    "we therefore addressed this issue in this note . in section 3",
    "we presented arguments which indicate that the enhanced corrections will be small at lhc energies , and will not appreciably affect either the value , or the uncertainty , of the previous predictions .",
    "one reason is that there is just not sufficient room in rapidity for the triple - pomeron vertex .",
    "the lhc is a bit below threshold for this contribution to be important .",
    "then , in section 4 , we described how measurements of leading neutrons at hera clearly confirm the smallness of these enhanced corrections .",
