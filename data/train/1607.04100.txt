    "the current solvency regulatory framework solvency ii emphasizes market - consistent valuation of liabilities ; it is explicitly stated that liabilities should be `` valued at the amount for which they could be ... transferred or settled ... between knowledgeable and willing parties in an arm s length transaction '' .",
    "solvency assessment of an insurance company is based on future net values of assets and liabilities , and market - consistent valuation enables solvency assessments that takes dependence between future values of assets and liabilities into account .",
    "moreover , current regulatory frameworks emphasize risk measurement over a one - year period .",
    "in particular , at any given time , the whole liability cash flow is taken into account in terms of the cash flow during the next one - year period and the market - consistent value at the end of the one - year period of the remaining liability cash flow .",
    "however , liability cash flows are typically not replicable by financial instruments .",
    "therefore , the contribution to the liability value from the residual cash flow resulting from imperfect replication must be determined .",
    "given an aggregate liability cash flow of an insurance company , portfolios may be formed that generate cash flows with expected values matching that of the liability cash flow .",
    "the traditional actuarial practice of reserving provides an example of such a portfolio consisting of default - free bonds . in case of dependence between the liability cash flow and market values of financial instruments",
    ", more sophisticated replicating portfolios may be more suitable .",
    "however , the mismatch between the cash flow of such a portfolio and that of the original liability cash flow is typically substantial .",
    "the residual liability cash flow must be handled throughout the life of the liability cash flow by making sure that sufficient additional capital is available at all times .",
    "capital providers , such as share holders , require compensation for providing buffer capital , which should be taken into account in the liability valuation .",
    "in particular , capital costs should be accounted for .    in solvency ii",
    ", the so - called technical provisions correspond to the aggregate liability value and is defined as the sum of a best estimate , corresponding to a discounted actuarial fair value , and a so - called risk margin aimed at capturing capital costs .",
    "unfortunately , the risk margin in the current regulatory framework lacks a proper definition and theoretical foundation , and different approximation formulas for this ill - defined object have been suggested .",
    "criticism of the risk margin and suggestions for better notions of cost - of - capital margins or market - value margins are found in e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this paper addresses valuation of an aggregate liability cash flow of an insurance company , although the problem and our suggested solutions apply to liability valuation in other contexts as well .",
    "we present an approach that , in many aspects , is similar to current practice and has wide - ranging applicability .",
    "the approach we propose is inspired by @xcite and @xcite , where the cost - of - capital margin for valuing aggregate liability cash flows is analyzed .",
    "the framework for liability cash flow valuation presented in @xcite combines financial replication arguments with cost - of - capital considerations .",
    "our proposed framework is on the one hand a generalization of that framework and with more attention paid to mathematical details . on the other hand , for the repeated one - period replication of the residual cash flow",
    ", we severely restrict the allowed replication instruments compared to @xcite .",
    "such a simplification of the problem allows us to derive much stronger results which in turn yields a framework that can be easily adopted , and it avoids many of the computational difficulties highlighted in @xcite without sacrificing conceptual consistency . from a practical perspective , it leads to an approach to valuation of liability cash flows that does not rely heavily on subjective choices of joint dynamics for market prices of possible replication instruments .",
    "the use of financial valuation principles in insurance is inevitable given the principle of market - consistent valuation of liabilities , in particular for liability cash flows with long durations and products with guarantees . for more on financial and actuarial valuation of insurance liabilities aimed at solvency assessment ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "conditional monetary risk measures and utility functions are important basic building blocks in the approach to liability cash flow valuation considered here .",
    "extensions from static , or one - period , risk measurement to dynamic risk measurement has been studied extensively for more than a decade following the seminal paper @xcite on one - period risk measurement , see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "much of the analysis of dynamic risk measurement has focused on dynamic measurement of risk corresponding to a single cash flow , such as the cash flow of a derivative payoff , at a fixed future time . in @xcite a market - value margin for valuation of insurance liabilities",
    "is presented based on multi - period mean - variance hedging .",
    "however , this valuation framework is not directly applicable to the problem we consider since the liability cash flow considered in @xcite occur at a terminal time whereas we consider cash flows at all times up to a terminal time . for the problem we consider , there is no natural way to roll cash flows forward and thereby reducing the dynamic risk measurement problem to a considerably simpler problem .",
    "the frameworks for dynamic risk measurement developed in @xcite and @xcite are well - suited to handle liability valuation problems of the type we consider .",
    "however , we do not want to restrict the liability cash flows to bounded stochastic processes .",
    "moreover , the liability valuation problem we consider corresponds to repeated one - period replication rather than truly multi - period replication .",
    "another important aspect is that we assume that the capital provider has limited liability and that causes the cost - of - capital margin to lack the convexity properties that are essential for the so - called risk - adjusted values analyzed in @xcite and similarly for the dynamic risk measures analyzed in @xcite .",
    "risk measurement for multi - period income streams are studied in @xcite and @xcite , where the dynamic risk measurement problem is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem .",
    "there , computational aspects of multi - period risk measurement are clarified and illustrated .",
    "although our approach to liability valuation differ substantially from that in @xcite and @xcite , computability is an essential feature .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : cocm_intro ] gives a nontechnical derivation of the cost - of - capital margin , as we believe that it should be defined , by economic arguments .",
    "section [ sec : val_framework ] presents a mathematical framework that allows the cost - of - capital margin to be defined rigorously , and establishes its fundamental properties .",
    "we also describe how the cost - of - capital margin is related to conditional monetary utility functions in the sense of @xcite , showing that the cost - of - capital margin is conceptually consistent with dynamic monetary utility functions and risk - adjusted values as defined in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there is however a major difference .",
    "the limited liability property of capital providers is an essential ingredient in our definition of the cost - of - capital margin and may cause violation of concavity / convexity properties .",
    "we define the cost - of - capital margin in terms of repeated one - period replication similar to @xcite and allow capital requirements to be given in terms of conditional versions of nonconvex risk measures such as value - at - risk which is the current industry practice for insurance markets subject to the solvency ii regulation .",
    "therefore , convexity properties are not assumed and not essential to us .",
    "time - consistency is however an essential property .",
    "for the cost - of - capital margin , this property essentially follows immediately from the definition . towards the end of section",
    "[ sec : val_framework ] we consider a family of conditional risk measures that include commonly used risk measures such as value - at - risk and spectral risk measures , and we show that this family of risk measures are particularly useful for ensuring stronger properties and explicit formulas for the cost - of - capital margin when the liability cash flow is restricted to certain families of stochastic processes .",
    "it is well known , see e.g.  @xcite and @xcite , that conditional or dynamic versions of value - at - risk and spectral risk measures are not time - consistent when applied to time periods of varying lengths . in our setting , only repeated conditional single - period risk measurement appears .",
    "therefore , time - inconsistency of risk measurement over time periods of varying lengths does not cause problems for the time - consistency of the cost - of - capital margin .",
    "section [ sec : cocm_spec_models ] considers specific models for the liability cash flow and the filtration representing the flow of information over time about the remaining cash flow until complete runoff of the liability .",
    "specifically , we consider models of autoregressive type and gaussian models .",
    "we show that when combined with the general framework presented in section [ sec : val_framework ] , these models allow for explicit formulas and stronger results concerning the effects of properties of the chosen filtration . we believe that the explicit expressions presented here constitute candidates for standard formulas for cost - of - capital margin computation that may be adopted in improved future solvency regulation .",
    "finally , section [ life_example ] presents a life - insurance example that illustrates features of the cost - of - capital margin and clarifies computational aspects .",
    "in this section we derive the cost - of - capital margin without mathematical details , they are found in section [ sec : val_framework ] .",
    "we consider time periods ( years ) @xmath0 , corresponding time points @xmath1 , and a filtered probability space @xmath2 , where @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "a liability cash flow corresponds to an @xmath5-adapted stochastic process @xmath6 interpreted as a cash flow from an aggregate insurance liability in runoff .",
    "our aim is to give a precise meaning to the market - consistent value of the liability by taking capital costs into account , and provide results that allow this value to be computed .",
    "when the value of an insurance liability cash flow includes capital costs from capital requirements based on future values of both assets and liabilities , the liability value depends on the future values of all assets , including assets held for investment purpose only . in particular , two companies with identical liability cash flows would assign different market - consistent values to the two identical cash flows .",
    "this has undesired implications . instead , as is done in e.g.  @xcite and prescribed by eiopa , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* article 38 ) , we take the point of view that an aggregate liability cash flow should be valued by considering a hypothetical transfer of the liability to a separate entity , a so - called reference undertaking , whose assets have the sole purpose of matching the value of the liability as well as possible",
    ".    we will give a meaning to the liability value by a particular two - stage valuation procedure : the first stage corresponds to choosing a replicating portfolio of traded financial instruments , the second stage corresponds to managing the residual cash flow from imperfect replication in the first stage .    at time @xmath7",
    ", a portfolio is purchased with the aim of generating a cash flow replicating the cash flow @xmath8 .",
    "this static replicating portfolio has a market price @xmath9 and generates the cash flow @xmath10 .",
    "we use the wording `` static '' in order the emphasize that , for the purpose of valuation , it is a portfolio strategy that is fixed throughout the life of the liability cash flow .",
    "however , the replicating portfolio may be `` dynamic '' in the sense that its cash flow depends on events not known at time @xmath7 .",
    "this is completely in line with pricing a financial derivative in terms of the initial market price of a self - financing hedging strategy .",
    "if @xmath8 is independent of financial asset prices , then the canonical example is a portfolio of zero - coupon bonds generating the cash flow @xmath11}=({\\mathbb{e}\\left [ x^o_t \\right]})_{t=1}^t$ ] .",
    "the value of the original liability is defined as the sum of the market price @xmath9 of the replicating portfolio and the value @xmath12 of the residual cash flow @xmath13 from repeated one - period replication using only cash funds provided by a capital provider with limited liability requiring compensation for capital costs .",
    "that is , the cash flow @xmath14 will be re - valued at all times @xmath0 .",
    "we call the value @xmath12 of the residual cash flow the cost - of - capital margin",
    ". note that we below refer also to @xmath15 as the cost - of - capital margin for all @xmath16 .",
    "we emphasize that repeated one - period replication is done with cash only . allowing for repeated one - period replication using a mix of assets such as bonds with short time to maturity inevitably makes the value of the liability cash flow depend on subjective views on the development over time of spot rates over different time horizons .",
    "next we will present economic arguments that lead to a recursion defining @xmath15 in terms of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , capital requirements and the acceptability condition of the capital provider . at time @xmath19 ,",
    "the insurance company is required to hold the capital @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a conditional monetary risk measure , see definition [ def : dynrisk ] , quantifying the risk from liability cash flow during year @xmath22 and the value at time @xmath22 of the remaining residual cash flow @xmath23 .",
    "the capital provider is asked to provide the capital @xmath24 the amount @xmath25 is the difference between the required capital @xmath20 and the value @xmath15 of the residual liability cash flow at time @xmath19 .",
    "if the capital provider accepts providing @xmath25 at time @xmath19 , then at time @xmath22 the capital @xmath26 is available .",
    "if this amount exceeds the value @xmath18 of the liability at time @xmath22 , then the capital provider collects the excess capital as a compensation for providing the buffer capital @xmath25 at time @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , the capital provider has limited liability : if @xmath27 then the capital provider has no obligation to provide further capital to offset the deficit .",
    "the capital provider s acceptability condition at time @xmath19 is expressed in terms of a conditional monetary utility function @xmath28 , see definition [ def : dynutil ] , and a value @xmath29 quantifying the size of the intended compensation to the capital provider for making capital available : @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath28 may be chosen as the conditional expectation although alternatives that take the risk aversion of the capital provider into account may be more appropriate .    combining and now gives , with @xmath32 , @xmath33",
    "if the inequality above is strict , then the capital provider obtains a better - than - required investment opportunity at the expense of policy holders who are obliged to pay higher - than - needed premiums .",
    "therefore , we define the value of the cash flow as the smallest value for which the capital provider finds the investment opportunity acceptable . that is , we replace the inequality above by an equality : @xmath34 recall that the market - consistent value we assign to the original cash flow is the sum of the market price @xmath9 of a replicating portfolio set up at time @xmath7 and the cost - of - capital margin @xmath12 .",
    "notice that if perfect initial replication is possible , then @xmath35 as there is no residual cash flow , and consequently @xmath36 since no capital funds for repeated one - period replication are needed .",
