    "while large cp violating asymmetry in the quark sector has recently been confirmed in b - meson decay at b factories  @xcite , the standard model ( sm ) does not predict any appreciable cp violation ( cpv ) in the lepton sector .",
    "however , physics beyond the sm , such as multi - higgs , susy , and lepto - quark models  @xcite , could result in cpv in leptonic processes ; since new bosons and higgs would strongly couple with heavy particles through quantum loop effects , cp violating phenomena could be significantly enhanced , particularly in @xmath1 decay , due to its very large mass compared to other leptons .    the contribution from cp violating interactions in the @xmath1-pair production process",
    "can be parametrized in a model - independent way using the electric dipole moment ( or form factor ) for the @xmath1 lepton . up to now",
