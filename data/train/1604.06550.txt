    "over a decade ago , i have been informed by serge lazzarini that raymond stora and valentine telegdi were discussing , at cern , an issue related to the expression of the spin - orbit coupling term in souriau s _ classical _ presymplectic model of spinning particles leading to the bargmann - michel - telegdi ( bmt ) equations .",
    "stora chose that model owing of the lack of a proper lagrangian formalism for these equations .",
    "a number of stimulating exchanges with him then convinced me that the souriau model ( recalled in section  [ sectionjms ] ) should be somehow revisited so as to yield again the `` robust '' bmt equations as well as the correct expression of the spin - orbit term , effectively model - dependent in the considered classical framework , and which was missing in the above - mentioned model . in his carefully hand - written notes , stora put forward an ingenious ansatz , presented in section  [ sectionrs ] , which proved quite useful to meet the above - mentioned requirements .",
    "we discussed the merits and demerits of this new model which features two , a priori independent , phenomenological parameters in the definition ( [ rs2form ] ) of the presymplectic ( lagrange ) two - form  @xmath0 .",
    "this flexibility finally enabled us to determine these adjustable parameters , hence the sought after model that would guarantee the bmt equations ( in the weak field limit ) with gyromagnetic ratio @xmath1 , and also provide the standard spin - orbit coefficient , proportional to @xmath2 , usually deduced from the dirac - pauli equation in the quantum mechanical framework .",
    "this new construction is patently phenomenological , as is souriau s one yielding a coefficient @xmath1 , instead of @xmath2 .",
    "now , the obtained fixing ( [ goodcoeffs ] ) of the coefficients of our model should have preferably resulted from another , fully `` predictive '' model .",
    "this difficulty should be imputed to the fundamental difference between the physics ruled by quantum mechanics and that described by ( semi-)classical models , even by those with a sound geometric basis .",
    "the arduous quest of this conjectured predictive model has , since then , been placed on standby .",
    "after raymond s passing , i found it fair and useful to make accessible to our community one of his yet unanswered queries and to witness his great scientific insights .",
    "consider a relativistic particle with mass @xmath3 , spin @xmath4 , electric charge @xmath5 , and _",
    "gyromagnetic _ ratio @xmath1 , under the influence of an external and constant electromagnetic field @xmath6 in minkowski space - time @xmath7 , with metric @xmath8 of signature @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote respectively the linear momentum and spin vectors of our particle at space - time location @xmath12 .",

    "the two - forms , @xmath6 , are often traded as fields of skewsymmetric endomorphisms of space - time , @xmath17 , via @xmath18 .",
    "space - time is oriented , and time - orientation is also assumed .",
    "we will put @xmath19 throughout the paper . ]",
    "these equations describe the motions of the particle in a _ weak _ electromagnetic field .",
    "let us emphasize that the spin precession featured by the third equation in ( [ bmt ] ) is used by experimentalists to measure @xmath20 with a very high accuracy ; see , e.g. , @xcite for a survey of the field - theoretical computations and experimental data concerning the muon gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath21 .",
    "we recall that the bmt equations have first been deduced from a semi - classical approximation of the dirac - pauli equation in @xcite .",
    "the system ( [ bmt ] ) was reconsidered by jean - marie souriau ( jms ) in the framework of presymplectic mechanics associated , in the relativistic framework , with the classification of coadjoint orbits of the ( connected component of the ) poincar group , @xmath22 , i.e. , of elementary relativistic classical systems @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the bmt equations can be given by the kernel of a certain presymplectic two - form on the nine - dimensional _ evolution space _ @xmath23 which is diffeomorphic to @xmath24 .    before dwelling on the coupling to an external electromagnetic field ,",
    "let us first recall how to describe the motions of a free relativistic particle endowed with mass , @xmath3 , and spin , @xmath4 . start with the closed two - form on  @xmath25 given by @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the normalized spin tensor , i.e. , the @xmath28-valued cross - product of @xmath29 and  @xmath30 .",

    "the unparametrized equations of free motion , namely @xmath32 , with @xmath33 , are given by the null distribution of ( [ free2form ] ) .",
    "as to the manifold @xmath34 of all the solutions of these equations , it is actually symplectomorphic to the eight - dimensional @xmath35-coadjoint orbit characterized by the invariants @xmath3 and @xmath4 .      in order to switch on non - minimal electromagnetic coupling of the system to an otherwise arbitrary external electromagnetic field ( emf ) , @xmath6 , souriau has proposed to replace ( [ free2form ] ) by the presymplectic ( lagrange ) two - form @xcite @xmath36 where the _ dressed _ mass may ] and coincides with ( [ mjms ] ) up to a higher - order term in the field strength . ]",
    "be given by @xmath37 and where @xmath38 is the spin - emf _ coupling term_.    the two - form  ( [ jms2form ] ) is indeed closed as a consequence of the homogeneous maxwell equations , @xmath39 .",
    "one shows that it has generically rank @xmath40 , by computing the rather complicated equations of motion , @xmath41 , which turn out to be non - linear in  @xmath6 ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "now , in the special case of a constant electromagnetic field , _ linearization _ of the above - mentioned equations around @xmath42 yields the one - dimensional distribution @xcite @xmath43\\\\[8pt ] \\delta{}i&=&\\displaystyle -\\frac{q}{m}\\lambda\\,fi\\\\[8pt ] \\delta{}j&=&\\displaystyle -\\frac{q}{m}\\lambda\\left[\\frac{g}{2}\\,fj + \\left(1-\\frac{g}{2}\\right)i\\,({\\overline{i}}{}fj ) \\right]\\\\[8pt ] \\end{array } \\right . \\label{jms}\\ ] ] on the evolution space , @xmath25 , where @xmath44 ( indicates a free parametrization of the integral leaves of this distribution ) .",
    "the system ( [ jms ] ) does exactly reproduce the two last bmt equations in ( [ bmt ] ) upon putting @xmath45 for the linear momentum and @xmath46 for the spin vector .",
    "let us emphasize that the velocity turns out to be no longer parallel to the linear momentum , due to the emergence of an _ anomalous velocity _ ( which vanishes in the _ normal _ case , @xmath47 ) .",
    "let us start with a brand new , closed , two - form on evolution space @xmath25 ( [ v ] ) which provides further modification to the presymplectic two - form ( [ jms2form ] ) , viz . , @xmath48{0pt}{25pt}$\\;\\;\\displaystyle { { \\sigma_{\\mathrm{rs}}}= { { \\scriptstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}}}{}s\\left(d{\\overline{i}}\\wedge\\omega\\,di - d{\\overline{j}}\\wedge\\omega\\,dj\\right ) -d{\\overline{p}}\\wedge{}dx + { { \\scriptstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}}}{}q\\,d\\overline{x}\\wedge{}f\\,dx } \\;\\;$ } } \\label{rs2form}\\ ] ] where , as suggested by raymond stora ( rs ) , we _ posit _ the new expression @xmath48{0pt}{25pt}$\\;\\;\\displaystyle { p = ( m+k\\alpha)i+\\ell\\star(f)j } \\;\\;$ } } \\label{p}\\ ] ] of the `` linear momentum '' in ( [ rs2form ] ) , with @xmath49 two independent parameters to be ultimately adjusted .",
    "this leads to a modification of the two - form @xmath50 by terms merely linear in @xmath6 .",
    "notice , however , that we have to dispense with the usual ( monolocality ) constraint @xmath51 .",
    "we now endeavor to determine the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 by requiring that the null distribution of @xmath54 duly lead again to the bmt equations .",
    "of course , one has @xmath55 in souriau s model ( [ jms2form ] ) and ( [ mjms ] ) .",

    "the general case of an arbitrary electromagnetic field is quite involved , and will not be required , at this point , to compare our distribution and the bmt differential equations .",

    "one might think that a treatment _  la _ kaluza - klein could provide some useful intuition . in any case , pursuing the quest of a purely geometric framework for a _ predictive _ model of classical particles with anomalous magnetic moment has been a program of research which we preciously kept in mind , and which , unfortunately , we have not had the opportunity to complete .    as a closing personal remark , i would say that am glad to have this way contributed , with the late colleagues raymond stora and valentine telegdi , to advances in the understanding of the subtle classical description of spinning particles with anomalous magnetic moment in an external electromagnetic field .",
