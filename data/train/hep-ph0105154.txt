    "weak decays of charmed and beautiful hadrons are quite favorable in particle physics because of their usage in determining fundamental parameters of the standard model and testing various theories and models . among these heavy hadron decays the semileptonic decays @xmath4 and @xmath5 have been observed experimentally .",
    "these exclusive decays provide one of the main channels to determine the important ckm matrix element @xmath1 .",
    "the difficulty in studying @xmath6 and @xmath5 decays mainly concerns the calculation of the relevant hadronic matrix elements of weak operators , or , equivalently , the corresponding form factors which contain nonperturbative contributions as well as perturbative ones and are beyond the power of pure qcd perturbation theory . up to present these form factors are usually evaluated from lattice calculations , qcd sum rules and some hadronic models .",
    "sum rule method has been applied to @xmath7 decay in the full qcd and provided reasonable results@xcite .",
    "since the meson b contains a single heavy quark , it is expected that its exclusive decays into light mesons may also be understood well in the effective theory of heavy quark , which explicitly demonstrates the heavy quark spin - flavor symmetry and its breaking effects can systematically be evaluated via the power of inverse heavy quark mass @xmath8 .",
    "the effective theory of heavy quark has been widely applied to heavy hadron systems , such as b decays into heavy hadrons via both exclusive and inclusive decay modes .",
    "there are two different versions of effective theory of heavy quark .",
    "one is the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) , which generally decouples the `` quark fields '' and `` antiquark fields '' and treats one of them independently .",
    "this treatment is only valid when taking the heavy quark mass to be infinite . in the real world , mass of quark must be finite , thus one should keep in the effective lagrangian both the effective quark and effective antiquark fields .",
    "based on this consideration , a heavy quark effective field theory ( hqeft ) @xcite has been established and investigated with including the effects of the mixing terms between quark and antiquark fields .",
    "its applications to the pair annihilation and creation have also been studied in the literature@xcite .",
    "though the hqeft explicitly deviate from hqet from the next - to - leading order , these two formulations of effective theory trivially coincide with each other at the infinite heavy quark mass limit . in our knowledge the exclusive heavy to light ( pseudoscalar ) decay channels have been discussed in @xcite , where the matrix elements in the effective theory have been formulated , but the two leading order wave functions have not been calculated .    in this paper we focus on the calculation of the leading order wave functions of @xmath6 decay by using the light cone sum rule in the effective theory of heavy quark . as an important application , @xmath1 is extracted . in section 2",
    ", the heavy to light matrix element is represented by two heavy quark independent wave functions a and b. in section 3 , we derive the light cone sum rules for the calculation of a and b. in section 4 , we present the numerical results and extract @xmath1 .",
    "our short summary is drawed in the last section .",
    "the matrix elements responsible for @xmath6 decay is @xmath10 , where b is the beautiful quark field in full qcd .",
    "it is generally parametrized by two form factors as follows , @xmath11    in the effective theory of heavy quark , matrix elements can be analyzed order by order in powers of the inverse of the heavy quark mass @xmath8 and also be conveniently expressed by some heavy spin - flavor indenpendent universal wave functions @xcite .",
    "here we adopt the following normalization of the matrix elements in full qcd and in the effective theory @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the heavy flavor independent binding energy reflecting the effects of the light degrees of freedom in the heavy hadron .",
    "@xmath15 is the effective heavy quark field in effective theory .",
    "associate the heavy meson state with the spin wave function @xmath16 we can analyze the matrix element in effective theory by carrying out the trace formula : @xmath17\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath18 , \\nonumber\\\\   \\hat{p}^\\mu&=&\\frac{p^\\mu}{v\\cdot p } \\;\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a and b are the leading order wave functions characterizing the heavy - to - light - pseudoscalar transition matrix elements in the effective theory .",
    "they are heavy quark mass independent , but are functions of the variable @xmath19 and the energy scale @xmath20 as well .",
    "nevertheless , since the discussion in the present paper is rrestricted within the tree level , we neglect the @xmath20 dependence from now on .    combining eqs .",
    "( [ fdef])-([abdef ] ) , one gets @xmath21 where the dots denote higher order @xmath8 contributions which will not be taken into account in the present paper . note that we have used different variables for @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "the relation between the variables @xmath19 and @xmath26 is @xmath27",
    "the qcd sum rule based on short distance expansion has been proved to be quite fruitful in solving a variety of hadron problems .",
    "nevertheless , it is also well known that this method meets difficulties in the case of heavy to light transition because the coefficients of the subleading quark and quark - gluon condensate with the heavy quark mass terms grow faster than the perturbative contribution , which implies the breakdown of the short distance operator product expansion ( ope ) in the heavy mass limit .",
    "alternatively , it has been found that heavy to light decays can be well studied by light cone sum rule approach , in which the corresponding correlators are expanded near the light cone in terms of meson wave functions . in this way",
    "the nonperturbative contributions are embeded in the meson wave functions instead of the vacuum condensates in the short distance ope sum rule .",
    "though there are some differences in the techniques of calculation , the two sum rule methods are based on the same idea of quark - hadron duality and dispersion relation , and furthermore , they follow the same procedure in deriving form factors .    for @xmath6 decay , one may consider the vacuum - pion correlation function @xmath28 here @xmath29 and @xmath30 are momenta carried by the pion and leptons .",
    "the b meson has momentum @xmath31 . inserting a complete set of states with b meson quantum numbers , we obtain the phenomenological representation @xmath32 with the normalization relation in ( [ normalization ] ) , the matrix elements in ( [ cor ] )",
    "can be expanded into the ones in effective theory of heavy quark in powers of @xmath33 . when all higher @xmath33 order contributions are neglected , ( [ cor ] ) reduces straightforwardly into @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the heavy hadron s residual momentum , @xmath36 .",
    "the first term in ( [ phen ] ) is a pole contribution obtained by using ( [ parinhqet ] ) together with the parametrization @xmath37\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with f being the leading order decay constant of b meson in effective theory @xcite .",
    "the second term in ( [ phen ] ) is the higher resonance contributions given in the form of an integral over the physical spectral density @xmath38 .",
    "note that the lorentz indices of the second term in ( [ phen ] ) are not written explicitly but embeded in @xmath38 .",
    "on the other hand , the correlator can be calculated and expressed as the form of an integration over the theoretic spectral density @xmath39 , which equals to @xmath38 under the assumption of quark - hadron duality .",
    "namely , the correlator ( [ correlator ] ) can be written as @xmath40 equating ( [ phen ] ) and ( [ theo ] ) yields @xmath41    so the next step involves the calculation of ( [ correlator ] ) in the framework of effective theory of heavy quark . substituting the heavy hadron states and heavy quark fields into the effective ones in the effective theory , and then performing the corresponding momentum shift @xmath42",
    ", we obtain when neglecting higher @xmath8 order corrections @xmath43 in the light cone sum rule approach , one should contract the heavy quark fields and expand the correlator into a series in powers of the twist of light cone pion wave functions .",
    "these light cone wave functions provide an alternative treatment besides the vacuum condensates .",
