    "onsager s reciprocity relations are cornerstones of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics  @xcite .",

    "when trs is broken , microreversibility further requires to invert all trs breaking fields , which , to fix ideas , one may take as magnetic fields , fluxes or exchange fields . combining all of them into a single multi - component field @xmath0",

    "thus the precise form of the onsager reciprocity relations depends on the symmetries of the system .",
    "seminal works have classified noninteracting quantum mechanical systems into ten general symmetry classes  @xcite , and it is the purpose of the present manuscript to derive onsager s relations for all these symmetry classes .",
    "four of them , in particular , combine two different types of quasiparticles  @xcite , with microscopic representations including , e.g. hybrid systems where quantum coherent normal metallic conductors are connected to superconductors . since at sub - gap energies an interface between a normal metal and a superconductor blocks heat currents but not electric currents  @xcite",
    ", it is natural to ask whether the onsager reciprocity relation between , say , the seebeck and peltier thermoelectric coefficients survives in such systems .",
    "onsager relations in the presence of superconductivity have been discussed rather incompletely until now  @xcite , despite much experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite interest in thermoelectric transport properties of hybrid normal - metallic / superconducting systems .    [",

    "thus we can conclude that    [ eq:2 ] @xmath7    with identical relations for @xmath8 . additionally , any system with phs has no thermoelectric nor spin caloritronic response .",
    "looking at table  [ table1 ] we see that only the aiii symmetry class has sls without phs .",
    "thus in this symmetry class , the spin - seebeck and spin - peltier coefficients are even functions of the external field , @xmath0 , while the usual seebeck and peltier coefficients vanish identically .",
    "we stress , however , that the analysis leading to eqs .",

    "the voltages @xmath11 and @xmath12 lie almost exactly in the middle between @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 for ballistic systems  @xcite .",
    "we assume that this is the case here , and set @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the presence of spin - orbit coupling inside the system generates a spin current flowing through the transverse terminals .",

    "[ fig : she]b , there is no voltage bias , but instead terminals 3 and 4 have opposite spin accumulations . in an idealized situation",
    "they will be @xmath20 .",
    "spin - orbit coupling converts this spin accumulation into a transverse electric current .",
    "the currents in terminals 1 and 2 read    @xmath21    in both cases , the hall part of the currents , flowing between 3 and 4 in the case of the spin hall effect and betwee 1 and 2 in the case of the inverse spin hall effect , is given by the difference in the two currents .",
    "we define spin hall and inverse spin hall conductances as @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "one obtains    @xmath24    together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : rules ] ) , eq .",

    "the reciprocity between direct and inverse spin hall conductances is exact and does not require sample averaging , as sometimes claimed  @xcite .          for a spin index @xmath26 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rules ] ) and ( [ eq : rules_sc ] ) establish the reciprocity between magnetoeletric effects generating spin currents from electric voltage biases and spin injection from spin accumulations in the terminals , a special case of which is the above - discussed spin hall effect / inverse spin hall effect reciprocity . in the presence of trs",
    ", it has already been observed that one consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : smatr_lms ] ) is that no spin current can be magnetoelectrically generated in a two - terminal device if the exit lead carries a single ( spin - degenerate ) transport channel .",
    "the reciprocity relations of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rules ] ) and ( [ eq : rules_sc ] ) further impose that a spin injection from such a terminal is incapable of generating an electric current , unless one goes to the nonlinear regime  @xcite .",
    "this seems not to have been noted so far .      in two - terminal geometries , the electric conductance is symmetric in trs breaking fields , which follows from current conservation or gauge invariance , together with the symmetry of electric reflection coefficients , @xmath27 ( see e.g. ref .",
    "including spin - transport , the unitarity of the scattering matrix further results in spin - current conservation and generalized gauge invariance , @xmath28 under the assumption that the number of transport channels coupling the system to external reservoirs is spin - independent . in two - terminal geometries",
    "this gives @xmath29 however , unlike for the charge conductance , the thermoelectric reflection coefficients can have both a symmetric and an antisymmetric component .",
    "this is directly seen from the expression @xmath30 for the spin seebeck reflection coefficient .",
    "for example for @xmath31 , the spin - dependent transmission coefficient in the integrand reads    @xmath32    which , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : smatr_lms ] ) has both symmetric , @xmath33 , and antisymmetric , @xmath34 components .",
    "an interesting example is provided by a two - terminal system with a well - defined spin quantization axis .",
    "this is the case , for example , for a system without spin - orbit coupling in a uniform zeeman field , for two - dimensional systems with both rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit interactions of equal strengths  @xcite , or for a system with pure @xmath35 spin - orbit coupling . without loss of generality",
    "we define the spin quantization axis as the @xmath36-axis .",
    "then @xmath37 commutes with @xmath38 , i.e.  it is diagonal in spin space . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : stran ] ) , we find that @xmath39 and @xmath40 when @xmath41 .",

    "( [ eq : general - gauge - invariance ] ) , we have @xmath42 .",
    "thus @xmath43 with @xmath44 when @xmath41 .",
    "next we recall that the seebeck - peltier onsager relations contain an extra minus sign for spin caloritronic effects compared to usual thermoelectric effects ( see table  [ table3 ] ) .",
    "this extra minus sign means that @xmath45 and @xmath46 are odd in @xmath0 , while @xmath47 and @xmath48 are even in @xmath0 .",
    "thus any two - terminal system with a spin - quantization axis will have spin - seebeck and spin - peltier effects which are odd functions of trs breaking fields , while the normal seebeck and peltier effects are even function of those fields .",
    "thermoelectric effects in the presence of superconductivity , in particular the thermopower @xmath49 and thermal conductance @xmath50 , have attracted quite some experimental  @xcite and theoretical interest  @xcite .",
    "however , the exact form that the seebeck - peltier onsager reciprocity relation takes has never been clarified , despite the fact that two - terminal devices with superconductors usually exhibit odd seebeck coefficients @xmath51 , in stark contrast with mott s relation  @xcite .",
    "mott s relation between the thermopower of metallic systems at low temperature and the energy derivative of the conductance at the fermi energy , reads @xmath52 and thereby indicates that @xmath53 should be even in @xmath0 .",

    "the latter , together with a systematic delay ( indicated by the extra length @xmath56 ) towards one of the superconducting contacts can break phs and generate finite thermoelectric effects  @xcite .",

    "this breaks one of the onsager relations between peltier and seebeck coefficients . for metallic systems , one has both @xmath63 and @xmath64  @xcite , however , with superconductivity , only @xmath63 holds .    when phs strictly holds , however , @xmath65 and both @xmath57- and @xmath58-coefficients vanish identically , regardless of the temperature . however , interesting thermoelectric effects appear in hybrid systems when phs is broken . focusing on a two - terminal geometry , as depicted in fig .

    "there are currently no known hybrid systems which have a finite - average @xmath83 .",

    "hybrid systems are examples of systems with purely elastic scattering and antisymmetric thermopower .",
    "thermoelectric effects vanish identically in all altland - zirnbauer symmetry classes because of phs .",
    "however in physical systems phs is often at least partially broken , leading to finite thermoelectric effects . here",
    "we show that the symmetry of such thermoelectric effects is subtly dependent on _ how _ phs symmetry is broken .    to that end",
    "we consider the andreev interferometer shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sc ] . a two - terminal chaotic ballistic or disordered diffusive quantum dot",
    "is connected to a superconducting loop via two contacts .",
    "the superconducting phase difference at the two contacts can be tuned by a magnetic flux piercing the loop .",
    "there are two important time scales in the system , ( i ) the typical time @xmath84 between two consecutive andreev reflections at the superconducting contact , and ( ii ) the escape time @xmath85 to one of the normal leads . we additionally choose a special geometry where the average time to reach one of the two superconducting contacts from one of the normal leads is longer  this is achieved by an extra ballistic `` neck '' of length @xmath56 between the cavity and the superconducting contact ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sc ] ) . because of the neck , quasiparticles need an additional time delay @xmath86 to reach the left superconducting contact from a normal lead .",
    "together with this time delay , a magnetic flux piercing the superconducting loop and making the superconducting phase difference @xmath87 finite also breaks phs , thereby turning thermoelectric effects on  @xcite .",
    "formally , phs requires that @xmath88 , which practically means that @xmath84 has to be smaller than any other time scale and any other inverse energy scale .",
    "when this is not the case , transport processes without any andreev reflection exist , giving contributions to the conductance that fluctuate randomly in energy around the fermi energy .",
    "this breaks phs and leads for instance to finite , albeit relatively weak , thermopower  @xcite . more generally , breaking phs",
    "can be achieved in three different ways ,    * rendering escape into the normal leads faster ( for instance by widening the normal leads ) , until @xmath89 , + * raising the temperature until @xmath90 , or + * changing the flux through the superconducting loop so that @xmath91 , when the neck length @xmath56 is finite .    in case ( i ) , a significant proportion of quasiparticles go from one normal lead to another without andreev reflection . then contributions to @xmath92 which arise from processes without andreev reflections will start to dominate thermoelectric transport , meaning @xmath93 [ as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : evenodd ] ) ] .",
    "thus , thermoelectric effects acquire the same symmetry as systems without sc contacts , i.e. they become predominantly even .",
    "the situation is more complicated in case ( ii ) , where both @xmath92 and @xmath94 have similar magnitude . in the absence of a neck , @xmath95 ,",
    "thermoelectric effects vanish on average and are dominated by mesoscopic fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of these mesoscopic fluctuations analogous to that in ref .",
    "[ ] shows that there is no correlation between @xmath96 and @xmath97 , so that the thermoelectric effects have no particular symmetry beyond the generic onsager reciprocities given in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "in particular , for a two terminal device @xmath98 and @xmath99 are independent random variables with the same variance .",
    "thus for a given andreev interferometer ( given disorder or cavity shape ) either quantity could be positive or negative , and either could have a larger magnitude than the other .    finally in case ( iii ) , the physics changes completely .",
    "due to the presence of a finite - sized neck , @xmath100 , and superconducting phase difference @xmath101 , the system develops a large average thermopower which is an odd function of the flux @xmath87  @xcite , with a much smaller even component coming from mesoscopic fluctuations @xcite .    in summary depending on how particle - hole symmetry is broken ,",
    "one gets a thermopower which is predominantly even in @xmath0 [ case ( i ) ] , predominantly odd in @xmath0 [ case ( iii ) ] , or which has no particular symmetry [ case ( ii ) ] .",
    "we have derived a complete list of reciprocity relations for coupled electric , spin , thermoelectric and spin caloritronic transport effects in all ten symmetry classes for single - particle hamiltonian systems .",
    "several of these relations appeared in one way or another in earlier works , and the main novelties we found are ( i ) reciprocities in spintronics and spin caloritronics pick a number of additional minus signs reflecting spin current injection and measurement , ( ii ) a number of special relations have been listed in table  [ table5 ] , which exist only in specific symmetry classes , ( iii ) we clarified the exact form of onsager relations in the presence of superconductivity , and ( iv ) we derived all onsager relations for transport in spintronics and spin caloritronics in the presence of superconductivity .",
    "we present a pictorial summary of the onsager reciprocity relations we derived in fig .",
    "[ fig : general - results ] .    generally speaking , our investigations of the specific reciprocities shown in table  [ table5 ] allowed us to clarify the form that the seebeck - peltier relations take in the presence of superconductivity . while the two relations , @xmath102 and @xmath103 exist in purely metallic systems , only one of these two onsager relations survives in the presence of superconductivity , that being @xmath103 .",
