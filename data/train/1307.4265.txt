    "a fundamental trait of quantum mechanics is the unavoidable uncertainty associated with measuring incompatible observables , i.e. , the so - called uncertainty principle , which dates back to heisenberg  @xcite .",
    "kennard  @xcite formalised heisenberg s original ideas in an uncertainty relation involving the products of standard deviations of the position @xmath0 and momentum @xmath1 observables , with the well - known inequality @xmath2 .",
    "robertson @xcite generalised this to arbitrary hermitian observables @xmath3 and @xmath4 and found the uncertainty relation @xmath5 { |\\psi\\rangle } |$ ] .",
    "from a conceptual point of view , though , standard deviation is an inadequate measure of uncertainty , when the latter is understood in terms of ( lack of ) knowledge of `` which outcome '' of a measurement , rather than in terms of the value of the outcome .",
    "also , the right - hand side ( r.h.s . ) of robertson s relation gives a trivial bound for states @xmath6 that have zero expectation of the commutator , even if @xmath6 is not a common eigenstate of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "it has thus been proposed to use the _ entropy _ of the probability distribution of the outcomes as the measure of uncertainty  .",
    "the best known _",
    "entropic uncertainty relation _ is probably the one by maassen and uffink @xcite .",
    "they proved that , for any state @xmath7 of a quantum system @xmath8 with a finite dimension @xmath9 , it holds @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 indicate here orthonormal bases on @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the shannon entropy of the probability distribution @xmath15 ( similarly for @xmath16 ) .",
    "the r.h.s .  of measures",
    "the strength of the knowledge tradeoff : the sum of the `` ignorance '' ( as measured by entropy ) about @xmath3 and @xmath4 can not be smaller than @xmath17 one has @xmath18",
    "( i.e. , @xmath19 ) if and only if ( iff ) @xmath3 and @xmath4 share a basis element , while @xmath20 is maximal , @xmath21 ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) , iff @xmath3 and @xmath4 are fully complementary , with @xmath23 for all @xmath24 .",
    "the uncertainty principle inspired the original proposal for quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "however , the uncertainty relations known at the time did not take into account the possibility for an eavesdropper to have quantum correlations , i.e. , entanglement  @xcite , with the system being measured .",
    "hence , those relations could not be directly used to prove cryptographic security .",
    "berta et al .",
    "@xcite filled such a gap , generalizing the uncertainty relation to take into account the possible use of a quantum memory .",
    "the latter would allow bob , who is supposed to have access to a quantum system @xmath25 that may be entangled to alice s system @xmath8 , to violate  @xcite .",
    "berta et al .",
    "showed that nonetheless , for any bipartite state @xmath26 , bob s uncertainty about the result of measurements in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bases on alice s system is bounded by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the _ conditional von neumann entropy _ , with @xmath29 the von neumann entropy , and @xmath30 the reduced state of @xmath26 on @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath31 can be interpreted as bob s ignorance about the result of alice s measurement of @xmath3 on @xmath8 , given that bob has access to the system @xmath25 ( similarly for @xmath32 )   for a precise definition of @xmath31 . ] .",
    "the two terms @xmath31 and @xmath32 are non - negative since they represent classical uncertainties , but @xmath33 can be negative if @xmath26 is entangled  @xcite , so that the effect of entanglement is to weaken the knowledge tradeoff .",
    "while equation   reduces to when @xmath25 is a trivial system , if @xmath34 are maximally entangled , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , we have @xmath37 independently of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the r.h.s .",
    "of gives a _ trivial _ bound on bob s uncertainty .",
    "the generality of opens up a range of applications , e.g. , in entanglement witnessing @xcite and in the security analysis of quantum key distribution @xcite .      one main result of this article is to improve the bound in by replacing @xmath20 with a larger parameter almost always strictly greater than @xmath20 .",
    "another result is the improvement of hall s  information exclusion principle \" @xcite , which regards the mutual information between the outcomes of measurements on one physical system , and a second system correlated with the first system .",
    "mutual information is a measure of correlations , and is the central quantity in , e.g. , communication theory  @xcite .",
    "it quantifies the number of bits of information gained  equivalently , the reduction of ignorance  about @xmath3 when given access to @xmath38 , and can indeed be defined as @xmath39 .",
    "hall s idea was essentially to reformulate the uncertainty principle in terms of mutual information , as follows .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be two orthonormal bases on system @xmath8 , and let @xmath38 be a classical register that may be correlated to @xmath8 .",
    "then @xmath40 hall s bound says that one can not probe the register @xmath38 in order to obtain complete information about both the @xmath3 and @xmath4 observables , if these two observables have a small value of @xmath41 ( defined in ) .",
    "bounds on the sum of complementary information terms have been called _ information exclusion relations _",
    "they have not been studied as much as uncertainty relations  , and the best known information exclusion relation , eq .",
    ", is actually not a very strong bound , as pointed out by grudka et al .",
    "grudka et al . have attempted to remedy this by conjecturing a stronger information exclusion relation .",
    "they found numerical evidence , and proved analytically in some special cases , that @xmath42 with the sum over the largest @xmath43 terms of the matrix @xmath44 $ ] ( again , see ) . since @xmath45",
    ", we have @xmath46 ( potentially with strict inequality ) and , if true , would be an improvement over hall s bound . in what follows",
    "we shall actually prove a _ stronger _ version of grudka et al.s conjecture .",
    "furthermore we will extend it to the much more general case of quantum memory , where @xmath38 is replaced by a general quantum system .",
    "besides improving both the uncertainty relation   and the information exclusion relation  , this article provides the insight that the complementarity of uncertainty ( i.e. , a limit on the knowledge about the outcomes of complementary observables ) and the complementarity of information ( i.e. , a limit on the correlations between the outcomes of complementary observables and some external system ) differ both conceptually and practically .",
    "hence , from the quantitative point of view , we should not expect to have the same complementarity factor appearing in uncertainty relations and information exclusion relations .",
    "what makes hall s bound weak is the use in of the same parameter @xmath41 as in .    in what follows , we first give a simplified presentation of our results in secs .",
    "[ sct2 ] and [ sct3 ] and then discuss their implications in secs .",

    "are given in the appendix .",
    "our main technical result is an entropic uncertainty relation that , much like , accounts for the possible reduction of bob s uncertainty about alice s system thanks to the entanglement between systems @xmath8 and @xmath25 . before presenting our strongest result",

    "notice that , for small @xmath41 , like in the case of almost complementary @xmath3 and @xmath4 , one has @xmath53to be compared with @xmath54 .",

    "furthermore , our state - dependent bound is often _ much _",

    "@xcite ( ch .  7 ) replaced @xmath20 in with a state - dependent bound @xmath103 , like we did in ; however in their case they have @xmath104 , so unlike our result it does not lead to a strengthened state - independent bound .",
    "as a corollary of , we prove grudka et al.s conjectured information exclusion relation  @xcite .",

    "indeed , in order to obtain a state - independent bound for uncertainty relations , we must consider the subspace with the least complementarity . on the other hand , in information exclusion relations",
    "it is the overall complementarity , i.e.  with respect to the various subspaces that compose the space , that matters .",
    "the reason our approach is better suited to capture information complementarity is that @xmath122 measures the overall complementarity , averaged over the whole space , of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
