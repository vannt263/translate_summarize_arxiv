    "as in the previous article @xcite , we investigate conductivities of a percolation model using the finite difference method ( fdm ) @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article and the previous one is to clarify how the percolation theory governs the conductivities in real materials which consist of small conductive particles , _",
    "e.g. _ , nanoparticles , with random configurations in an insulator . in general",
    ", the small particles in a real material have some typical sizes , shapes like spheroids , and cluster structures due to their agglomeration @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to investigate an agglomeration effect on the conductivity whereas the previous one @xcite is a study on the effect of the shape of each particle .",
    "we propose a simple numerical algorithm to simulate an agglomerated configuration of particles though there are some physical models which numerically simulate the agglomerated phenomena @xcite . in this article",
    ", we employ the simple algorithm .",
    "since our algorithm has a parameter which controls the agglomerated configurations consistently without any difficulties , we numerically show how the conductivity depends upon the agglomerations .",
    "then we find the fact that the main agglomeration effect on the conductivity can be interpreted as the size effect of the system .",
    "we also discuss an effect of shape of the agglomerated clusters on the universal property of the conductivity .",
    "the conductivity is one of the most concerned phenomena in the percolation theory @xcite-@xcite and it is important to investigate the conductivity curve @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a constant factor , @xmath2 is the volume fraction , @xmath3 is the percolation threshold , and @xmath4 is the critical exponent of the conductivity .",
    "the behaviors of the threshold @xmath3 and the exponent @xmath4 represent the conductive properties of the systems in the percolation phenomena , which have some universal properties .",
    "it means that their dependence on some parameters of a model is sufficiently weak due to the randomness . in order to discuss the universal properties ,",
    "the percolation theory is , basically , based upon a system with the infinite size @xcite@xmath5@xcite .",
    "however when we apply the percolation theory to the real composite materials of conductive nanoparticles in an insulator , we encounter effects coming from the shape of the nanoparticles and several characteristics lengths . besides lattice percolation models which are given on discrete lattices , the continuum percolation model ( cpm ) was introduced as in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . in order to handle the size and the shape of particles",
    ", cpm has been studied @xcite . in the previous article @xcite",
    ", we numerically studied the shape effects on the conductivities in cpms among the different aspect ratios of spheroids , where we allowed overlap of the particles .",
    "as a numerical method , we employed the finite difference method ( fdm ) , domain decomposition method on the parallel computations and the preconditioned conjugate gradient method ( pcgm)@xcite , though similar attempts to estimate transport properties or electric properties in cpm using the finite element method ( fem ) appeared in refs .  @xcite . for a quite complicated geometrical objects ,",
    "fdm over the regular lattice is basically robust from the viewpoint of the numerical computations .",
    "then the previous article shows that the conductivity in cpm strongly depends upon the shape of the composed particles .    in this article",
    ", we will consider another shape effect or the agglomerated effect of these stuffed spherical particles on the conductivity .",
    "with the development of the technology , the smaller the size of the ( nano-)particles becomes , the smaller the size of the related devices becomes .",
    "when we investigate the conductivities in the real composite materials of conductive nanoparticles from the viewpoint of the percolation theory , we handle three characteristic lengths , i.e. , 1 ) the size of the particle as a minimal size , 2 ) the size of the system , e.g. , the thickness of the film , as the maximal size , and 3 ) the size of the percolation cluster which is given by a multiplication of the size of the particles and is also related to the size of the system . when the size of devices is sufficiently small , it is important to consider the size effect of the system though the conductivities in the system with infinite size are basically concerned in the percolation theory . in other words , in order to apply the percolation theory to a real material system , it is crucial to consider the relations among these scales .    the smaller the size of particles is , the more agglomerated the particles becomes , due to their interface energy .",
    "agglomeration forms agglomerated clusters and the cluster brings the fourth characteristic scale to the system .",
    "thus the evaluation of the agglomeration effect on the conductivity is very important . by employing the simple algorithm to simulate the agglomeration of particles ,",
    "we numerically give a series of agglomerated configurations of cpm , which we call _ agglomerated continuum percolation models _ ( acpms ) , and investigate the conductive properties of acpms by means of fdm . in this article",
    ", we also handle the overlapping particles @xcite .",
    "we show the dependence of the conductivity curves on the agglomeration as in figure [ fig : thandexvsag ] since our algorithm provides natural properties from view point of a conditional probabilistic problem as we show in subsection 2.1 .    since the finite size effects in the conductivity on a percolation model were studied in chapters 4 and 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite , based upon these studies , we numerically consider the relation between the geometrical effects and the properties of the conductivities in acpms . as a result",
    ", we show that one of the dominant agglomerated effects on the conductivities with acpm can be regarded as the size effects of the system .",
    "we also show that it is expected that the shape of the agglomerated clusters might affect the conductivity .",
    "the shape effect implies that the agglomeration would have an effect on the universal properties of the conductivity curve ( [ eq:1 - 2 ] ) , and thus we numerically discuss the relation between the shape effect and the agglomeration effect in subsection 4.2.3 .",
    "contents in this article are as follows .",
    "section 2 shows our computational method .",
    "subsection 2.1 describes our algorithm to construct the agglomerated clusters in cpm and the geometrical setting in acpms .",
    "section 2.2 provides the computational method of the conductivity over acpms using fdm , which is basically the same as that in the previous article @xcite .",

    "we also briefly show the computational method of the conductivities over acpms using fdm in subsection 2.2 , whose details are described in the previous article @xcite .",
    "we set particles parametrized by their positions @xmath7 into a box - region @xmath8\\times [ 0,y_0]\\times [ 0,z_0]$ ] at random and get a configuration @xmath9 as one of cpms . in this article",
    ", we set @xmath10 .",
    "the particle corresponds to a stuffed sphere or ball with the same radius @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "the configuration @xmath9 is given by @xmath13 .    by fixing the radius @xmath11 of the particle , @xmath14 , and a number",

    "we illustrate our algorithm by a flowchart in figure [ fig : flowchart ] . as an initial state",
    ", the configuration @xmath16 has no particle .",
    "as the first step , for a uniform random position @xmath17 we set a particle @xmath18 whose center is @xmath7 and the radius is @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "let us consider @xmath20-step .",
    "we take a position @xmath7 at uniform random in @xmath21 , and another random parameter @xmath22 at uniform random in @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "if the random parameter @xmath22 is greater than @xmath24 , we employ the position @xmath7 as the center of a particle and @xmath25 . it is noted that we allow the particles to overlap each other .    when the random parameter @xmath22 is given as @xmath26 , we first check whether the ball whose center is the position @xmath7 is connected with the previous configuration @xmath9 or not .",
    "if it is connected with the configuration @xmath9 , or @xmath27 , we employ the position and add the particle into the configuration @xmath9 , or @xmath25 .",
    "if not , i.e. , @xmath28 , we abandon the position and go on to take another uniformly random position @xmath7 in @xmath21 until we find the position which supplies a connected particle @xmath18 with @xmath9 .    in other words ,",
    "if we take @xmath22 which is smaller than @xmath24 , the added particle must be connected with the previous configuration @xmath9 .",
    "thus , @xmath24 stands for the agglomeration of the particle system .    by monitoring the total volume fraction which is a function of @xmath9 and",
    "is denoted by @xmath29 , we continue to put the particles as long as @xmath30 for a given volume fraction @xmath2 .",
    "we find the step @xmath31 such that @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

    "as illustrated in figure [ fig:3dview ] , the uniform random configuration is realized as the case @xmath39 , and the agglomeration configurations are given with our agglomeration parameter @xmath40 .",
    "we regard acpm of the case @xmath41 as the ordinary cpm for balls with the same radius @xcite and thus we simply call it cpm hereafter .    in our algorithm , @xmath18 in @xmath9 is determined only by the previous configuration @xmath42 as a conditional probabilistic problem like @xmath43 .",
    "since the configuration @xmath42 memorizes @xmath44 past outcomes @xmath45 , it can not be regarded as a markov chain for @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "however we have a natural hierarchical properties @xmath47 as a sequential events governed by conditional probabilities for @xmath48 case and by the independent probability for the vanishing @xmath24 case .",
    "since we use the pseudo - randomness to simulate the random configuration @xmath49 for given @xmath2 and @xmath24 , the configuration @xmath49 depends upon the seed @xmath50 of the pseudo - randomness which we choose .",
    "we let it be denoted by @xmath51 . in other words , for a certain seed @xmath50 of the pseudo - randomness , we handle the set of the configurations @xmath52\\}$ ] as the sequence of the outcomes of the conditional probabilistic problems .",
    "due to the hierarchical properties , @xmath51 is the events under the prior conditions @xmath53 for @xmath54 , and the configuration @xmath55 of a volume fraction @xmath2 naturally contains a configuration @xmath53 for @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath57 .",

    "by employing the simple algorithm to simulate an agglomerated configuration of particles , which is controlled by the agglomeration parameter @xmath155 $ ] , we numerically show how the thresholds @xmath3 and the exponent @xmath4 of the conductivity curve ( [ eq : sigmatotal ] ) depend upon the agglomerations as shown in figure [ fig : thandexvsag ] . since our algorithm is given as a sequence of conditional probabilistic events ( [ eq : filtr ] ) , we can statistically investigate the conductivity curves as functions over the sequences .",
    "the larger the agglomeration parameter @xmath24 is , the larger the variance is .",
    "further the larger @xmath24 is , the smaller the average of the thresholds is and the larger the average of the exponents is .    from section 4 , we conclude that the origin of these effects could be interpreted as the size effect mainly , because the agglomeration makes the percolation clusters larger than those of non - agglomerated case . since for the finite region , the enlargement of the clusters makes the variances of the conductivity large , the size effect is crucial if the size of system is not large enough .",
    "subsidiarily it is expected that the shape of the agglomerated clusters also affect the conductivity .",
    "it means that the shape of the agglomerated clusters might have effects on the universal properties of the threshold and the exponents as we attempted an investigation in subsection [ sec : univacpm ] .    due to the development of the technology , devices with small sizes and",
    "the small conductive nanoparticles are concerned .",
    "small particles basically agglomerate much due to their surface energy .",
    "then in the conductivity in the composite materials of the conductive nanoparticles , the agglomeration causes the variances of the conductivity and the difference of individual devices .",
