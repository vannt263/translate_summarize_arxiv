    "bristle bots are characterised by small size , robust and cheap design , and high speed of locomotion .",
    "applications of bristle bots can be found in inspection technology @xcite , search and rescue systems @xcite , and swarm robotic research @xcite .",
    "the mechanism underlying their locomotion capabilities has been studied in @xcite . to change motion direction of bristle - based mobile robots the following methods",
    "have been reported in the literature : changing the rotation direction of an unbalanced motor @xcite , using the phase shift between two unbalanced rotors @xcite or changing the inclination of the bristle system using additional actuators @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies @xcite have suggested that , for systems excited by vertical oscillations and moving along a straight line , direction of motion can be controlled by tuning the frequency of actuation .",
    "we provide in this paper an experimental validation of this prediction .",
    "our results may be of interest in the field of inspection systems optimized for limited manoeuvring space , e.g. pipe inspection robots @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we accommodate the analysis presented in @xcite for internally actuated robots in the context of an equivalent system , which consists of an inactive robot placed on a vibrating substrate .",
    "this setting provides cleaner and more efficient experimental study . in section 3",
    "we summarize the results of the experiments , and in section 4 we outline possible directions for future work .",
    "bristle bots are actuated by an internal vibrating engine . in order to better study their behaviour experimentally , however , we can avoid the encumbrance of an on - board motor by considering the setting depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ly - modell ] .",
    "the setting consists of a ( inactive ) robot lying on a vertically vibrating substrate ( shaker ) . as we show below , the resulting physical system , when considered in the shaker attached frame ,",
    "is identical to that of a bristle bot moving on a still substrate and driven by an internal oscillating force .",
    "the robot is modelled as a two - dimensional rigid object , consisting on a row of @xmath0 weightless support elements ( bristles ) of length @xmath1 attached to a main body of mass @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath3-th bristle is connected to the main body by a rotatory spring of stiffness @xmath4 .",
    "the inclination of the bristles with respect to the vertical is given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the inclination angle in the unloaded configuration .",
    "the ( horizontal ) friction force acting at the contact point of the @xmath3-th bristle with the shaker is modelled as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the normal reaction force acting on the tip of the bristle , @xmath9 is a phenomenological friction coefficient , and @xmath10 the velocity of the contact point in the horizontal direction .",
    "we denote with a dot the derivative with respect to time .",
    "we introduce two cartesian coordinate systems in the vertical plane : the fixed reference frame ( @xmath11 ) and the shaker - attached frame ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the vertical displacement of the shaker at time @xmath13 with respect to the @xmath14 axis is given by @xmath15 .",
    "we suppose that each bristle is always in contact with the shaker , and that the robot does not rotate with respect to the @xmath16-plane .",
    "we have then @xmath17 while all contact points have the same horizontal velocity @xmath18 for every @xmath19 . applying the principle of linear momentum",
    "we obtain @xmath20 where @xmath14 and @xmath21 are the coordinate of the centre of mass @xmath22 in the fixed frame , and @xmath23 is the total normal force . with @xmath24 and @xmath25 the balance of linear momentum reads @xmath26 notice that @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the coordinates of @xmath22 in the shaker - attached frame . finally , the principle of angular momentum gives @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "observe that equations ( [ onetwo ] ) and ( [ three ] ) are formally identical to the equations describing the same bristle bot model lying on a still substrate and actuated by an internal vertical force @xmath31 .      to normalize the dynamical variables we define the following parameters @xmath32",
    "we define then the _ normalized _ normal force @xmath33 , angle difference @xmath34 , and horizontal velocity @xmath35 of the robot as @xmath36 applying all the definitions above , equations ( [ onetwo ] ) and ( [ three ] ) can be rewritten as the equivalent system in the dimensionless time @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 in the following we suppose that @xmath40 is a small parameter , and @xmath41 .",
    "we derive in this section an estimate of the average horizontal velocity of the robot , and we show how it can change sign for different values of the frequency of actuation . to obtain this estimate , we solve ( [ norm ] ) by expanding the solution in power series in the ( small ) parameter @xmath42 , that is @xmath43 expanding ( [ norm ] ) in powers of @xmath42 , and matching coefficients of equal power , leads to a sequence of equations to be solved successively for the unknowns ( @xmath44 ) , with @xmath45 .",
    "it can be proved rigorously , see @xcite , that converge uniformly for every small enough @xmath42 , and that only one periodic solution exist for each coefficient @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 at each order . the resulting sum for @xmath34 ,",
    "@xmath35 , and @xmath33 is the only periodic solution of , and any other solution of the system converges asymptotically in time to it .",
    "the zero - order system is given by @xmath49 and its only periodic solution is @xmath50 now , imposing , the first order system reads @xmath51 we look here for solutions of the type @xmath52 replacing in and matching coefficients of sines and cosines respectively , we end up with six equations which allow us to determine @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "we obtain @xmath59 we then recover , in particular , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is a periodic function with zero average .",
    "indeed , the average velocity of the robot is of the order @xmath62 , however , we do not need to solve the second order system to recover a formula for it .",
    "we observe that , imposing , the second order expansion of the second equation in gives @xmath63 we know from the previously stated results in @xcite that admits one periodic solution for @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , in particular , @xmath66 and @xmath67 have zero average .",
    "from then follows that the average @xmath68 of @xmath64 can be written in terms of the solution of the first order system @xmath69 this last equation provides an explicit formula for the approximate ( normalized ) average horizontal velocity of the robot since @xmath70 moreover , shows how the sign of the average velocity depends on that of the difference between the two parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and ultimately on the frequency @xmath73 , see .",
    "the formula predicts an average motion in the negative direction for large values of @xmath74 , and in the positive direction for small values of @xmath74 .",
    "2 shows the frequency dependence of @xmath68 when we fit with the parameters of the prototype described below .",
    "the frequency such that @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 which gives an approximation of the frequency at which the inversion of motion of the robot occurs . in the experiments below @xmath77 .     against excitation frequency @xmath74 , with @xmath7810.5  g , @xmath79 8  mm , @xmath80 , @xmath81  nm , @xmath82  9.81  @xmath83 , @xmath84",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig .  [ fig : exp ] .",
    "it consists of a passive robot prototype lying on a platform attached to an electromagnetic shaker , which provides vertical excitation .",
    "the main body of the robot is made of polymer material with length @xmath85 width @xmath85 height = 55  mm @xmath85 35  mm @xmath85 17  mm . , and mass @xmath86  10.5  g. the bristle functionality is realised by two 30  mm wide paper strips with a free length @xmath87  8  mm . with a mass of 55  mg ,",
    "the paper strips meet sufficiently well the model assumption of massless bristles .",
    "the centre of mass of the robot is located in the middle between the ground - bristle contact points in order to avoid rotation on the main body , see model condition ( [ winkel ] ) .",
    "in contrast with the model , the elasticity of the real bristles is equally distributed along their length . their equivalent rotational stiffness and inclination angle are calculated to be @xmath88  nm and @xmath89  35.2  @xmath90 .",
    "robot and shaker are equipped with markers for motion tracking .",
    "the shaker is switched on producing vertical sinusoidal vibrations with controllable frequency and amplitude , leading to directed locomotion of the robot . at different frequencies we tune the amplitude of the shaker in order to match our analytic assumption @xmath91 and , in turn , to avoid the robot from losing contact with the ground .",
    "we recover a clear motion in the positive horizontal direction for frequencies below @xmath92 hz , and motion in the negative direction for frequencies above @xmath93 hz , in agreement with the theoretical predictions ( between 10 and 18 hz results are inconclusive ) .              for two oscillation frequencies we filmed the experiments with an high - speed camera ( fig 3 shows a frame of the videos ) .",
    "locomotion is analysed by tracking the markers on the robot and the shaker .",
    "fig 4 presents the tracking results for an excitation below the calculated inversion frequency , while fig .",
    "5 shows the tracking results for excitation above the inversion frequency .",
    "we showed analytically and experimentally that the inversion of motion of bristle bots is possible by tuning the frequency of pure vertical excitation .",
    "future work should focus on models accounting on more quantitatively accurate description of frictional interactions .",
    "further experimental analysis is needed to find precisely the relation between robot parameters and locomotion characteristics ."
