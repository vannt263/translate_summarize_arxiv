    "though @xmath0 violation has only been observed in the neutral kaon system , both the standard model ( sm ) and its many extensions predict large @xmath0-violating effects in @xmath2 decays .",
    "one of the main programs at the @xmath2 factories is to test the sm cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) paradigm of @xmath0 violation through , for example , measurement of the angles of unitarity triangle . in particular ,",
    "the angle @xmath4 can be cleanly related within the sm to the @xmath0 asymmetry in the  gold - plated \" decay of @xmath3 .",
    "the current sm fit already places quite a nontrivial constraint on this angle : @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "therefore direct experimental measurement of the angles of the unitarity triangle with values in gross disagreement with the sm expectation will be a clear signal for new sources of @xmath0 violation .",
    "it is thus important to explore the pattern of @xmath0 violation in @xmath2 decays in different models of @xmath0 violation .    two higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) without natural flavor conservation @xcite ( nfc ) , also called model iii @xcite , contain in general both tree - level flavor - changing neutral higgs ( fcnh ) couplings and new @xmath0-violating phases beside the ckm phase .",
    "the phenomenology of this class of models thus differs significantly from that of the much studied 2hdm s with nfc ( _ i.e. , _ models i and ii @xcite ) where neither tree level fcnh couplings nor new @xmath0 violating phases are present . it is worth noting that the abandonment of nfc is not against any fundamental principle and in fact it opens up many possibilities for flavor physics . depending on the ansatz for fcnh couplings , type iii 2hdm need not run into problems with the low energy data such as @xmath1 mixing . in this talk , we present a @xmath0 violation study of a specific type iii 2hdm introduced in @xcite where the top quark is treated differently than the other quarks .",
    "as will be shown , the charged higgs sector of the model could lead to a distinctive pattern of @xmath0 violation in @xmath2 decays even after imposing all the experimental constraints .",
    "the top - quark 2hdm ( t2hdm )  @xcite distinguishes itself from 2hdm s with nfc by the special status it gives to the top quark , as evidenced in the yukawa couplings , @xmath6 where @xmath7 @xmath8 , and where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are @xmath12 matrices in generation space ; @xmath13 ; @xmath14 ; and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the usual left - handed quark and lepton doublets .",
    "note that among the right - handed quarks , only @xmath17 couples to @xmath18 , and that the mass hierarchy between the top quark and the other quarks is understood as a result of the hierarchy between the vev s of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this form of the yukawa interactions can be seen as a consequence of some discrete symmetry . denoting the ratio of the two vev s by @xmath20 ,",
    "the model then requires a large @xmath21 in accordance with the large mass ratio of the top and bottom quarks , @xmath22 . in our analysis",
    ", we will always take @xmath23 .    the absence of nfc in the model results in tree level fcnh couplings among the up - type quarks , whose contribution to @xmath24 mixing is dependent on the mixing among the right - handed up - type quarks@xcite .",
    "for the charged higgs sector , we obtain the following yukawa lagrangian @xcite , @xmath25                  + \\overline{u}_r m_u v d_l\\left[g^+ -\\tan\\beta h^+\\right ]                          \\right .",

    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 are the diagonal up- and down - type quark mass matrices , @xmath30 is the usual ckm matrix , and @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the unitary rotation that brings the right - handed up - type quarks from gauge eigenstates to mass eigenstates . unlike 2hdm s with nfc ,",
    "the t2hdm depends on the @xmath32 rotation . for our analysis , we take the simple parameterization for @xmath32 @xcite , @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is a complex number of order unity . the @xmath36 matrix",
    "then depends only on the unknown parameter @xmath37 , @xmath38 for numerical analysis , we will assume @xmath39 .",
    "several features of the model can be noted .",
    "first , it contains a new cp violating phase @xmath40 through its dependence on @xmath32 . by comparison",
    ", 2hdm s with nfc ( models i and ii ) involve only the ckm phase . secondly , charm quark yukawa couplings of the type @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) are proportional to @xmath21 and thus are enhanced in this model .",
    "in contrast , the corresponding couplings in models i and ii of the 2hdm are suppressed by @xmath43 .",
    "it is the presence of the new phase that leads to a novel cp - violating pattern in @xmath2 decays , as will be shown later . on the other hand , the enhanced charm yukawa s",
    "draw our immediate attention to the @xmath1 system , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "recall that there exists no tree level fcnh coupling among the down - type quarks in the present model .",
    "the most important contribution to the @xmath1 system from the charged higgs sector is associated with the @xmath46 box diagram which has a huge enhancement factor of @xmath47 . therefore ,",
    "both the @xmath1 mass difference @xmath48 and the cp violation parameter @xmath49 are expected to place stringent constraints on the parameter space of the model .    * @xmath50 *    in the sm the short - distance contribution to @xmath48 is dominated by the charm quark and the long distance contribution can not be estimated reliably though is expected to be quite significant @xcite . including both the sm and the charged higgs effects , we obtain in the t2hdm the total short distance contribution to the mass difference as , @xmath51\\ ] ] where the first term is the sm charm contribution and the second term is due to the dominant @xmath46 box diagram . here",
    "@xmath52 is the usual bag factor , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the qcd corrections to the two box diagrams .",
    "the sm top quark contribution is a few percent of the charm quark effect and is not included here .",
    "similarly , in comparison to the @xmath46 box diagram , the contributions from @xmath56 and other box diagrams are small in the large @xmath57 limit and are ignored .    to numerically deduce the allowed parameter space subject to the @xmath48 constraint , we use the method described in @xcite for error analysis . assuming the magnitude of the long distance contribution to @xmath48 to be no larger than @xmath58 and simply taking @xmath59",
    ", we find the @xmath60 c.l .",
    "limit , @xmath61 which is valid for @xmath62 . as a result of the @xmath47 dependence in @xmath48 ,",
    "this constraint puts a severe lower bound on the charged higgs mass when @xmath57 is large . by comparison ,",
    "the charged higgs effect on @xmath48 in 2hdm s with nfc is suppressed by @xmath63 and is thus negligible .",
    "note also that the short distance effect is independent of the mixing parameter @xmath37 of the t2hdm .    * @xmath64 *    unlike @xmath48 , the @xmath0 violation parameter @xmath49 is short distance dominated . in the sm , the dominant component of @xmath49 comes from the @xmath65 and @xmath66 box diagrams .",
    "the complete expression and its numerical evaluation , including the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) qcd corrections , can be found in @xcite .",
    "the charged higgs contribution to @xmath49 is still dominated by the charm quark , with the imaginary part of the @xmath46 box diagram now dependent on both the magnitude and the phase of @xmath37 .",
    "more explicitly , this contribution from charged higgs exchange is given by , @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 are the ckm parameters in the wolfenstein parameterization @xcite , @xmath72 is the ckm phase , and @xmath73 .    due to its dependence on the new phase @xmath40 ,",
    "@xmath49 no longer restricts the ckm angle @xmath74 .",
    "in fact , current data allows a wide range of values for @xmath74 .",
    "we can obtain bounds on the parameter @xmath75 for any given value of @xmath74 by allowing @xmath76 to vary within its @xmath77 uncertainties derived from @xmath78 . for a real ckm matrix ( @xmath79 ) , we obtain the @xmath60 c.l bound @xmath80 ; the bound becomes @xmath81 for @xmath82 . if @xmath74 takes its sm central value of @xmath83 @xcite , the bound becomes nearly symmetric about zero as expected : @xmath84 . unlike @xmath48 , the cp violation parameter @xmath49 imposes a constraint on the @xmath85 plane that is dependent on @xmath86 and @xmath40 . as for @xmath48 , the charged higgs contribution to @xmath49 in 2hdm s with nfc is suppressed by @xmath63 and is thus negligible when @xmath21 is large .      the agreement between the experimental measurement and the sm prediction for the @xmath44 decay rate places stringent constraints on possible flavor physics beyond the sm . in model ii for example , where the most important correction comes from the top quark and charged higgs loop ,",
    "a @xmath21-independent lower bound of about @xmath87 can be imposed on the charged higgs mass  @xcite .",
    "this picture changes dramatically in the t2hdm where the charm yukawa s are greatly enhanced relative to those in model ii .",
    "consequently , both top and charm loops involving charged higgs exchange become important .",
    "furthermore , both amplitudes become complex due to their dependence on the new phase @xmath40 . as a result ,",
    "the charged higgs amplitude can interfere either constructively or destructively with the sm amplitude depending on the phase @xmath40 .",
    "the bound on the charged higgs mass will be dependent on both @xmath57 and @xmath37 , and a relatively light higgs can still be allowed .    for the numerical estimate , we will simply neglect the effect of the scalar operator @xmath88 induced from higgs exchange , and concentrate on the effect due to the charged higgs correction to the matching condition for the leading - order ( lo ) wilson coefficient @xmath89 at the scale @xmath90 : @xmath91   \\label{eq : delc7 } \\\\                 \\!\\ ! & & \\!\\!\\ !",

    "in the sm , the time - dependent @xmath0 asymmetry @xmath99/ \\left[\\gamma(b(t))+\\gamma(\\overline{b}(t))\\right]$ ] for @xmath100 is free of hadronic uncertainties and is given by @xmath101  @xcite , where @xmath102 is the mass difference between the neutral @xmath2 mesons . existing experimental data",

    "note that this @xmath0 asymmetry in the sm arises from the @xmath103 mixing @xcite and not from the decay amplitudes , as can be seen easily from the wolfenstein parameterization of the ckm matrix .    in the t2hdm ,",

    "terms which are subdominant in the large @xmath57 limit are not included in the above equation .",
    "note that the charged - higgs - mediated decay amplitude is complex and its interference with the sm amplitude could significantly modify the @xmath0 asymmetry in @xmath3 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the charged higgs has a vanishingly small effect on the @xmath103 mixing amplitude .    to proceed , we assume factorization and use fierz rearrangement to evaluate the hadronic matrix elements of the two four - fermi operators .",
    "the total amplitudes are then obtained , ( bk_s ) _ sm , ( |bk_s ) _ sm where the sm amplitudes satisfy @xmath110 .",
    "therefore the ratio @xmath111 gets a phase , /a = ( - 2 i ) , = / ( 1- ) instead of measuring @xmath112 , the @xmath0 asymmetry nows measures @xmath113    although the magnitude of @xmath114 can be at most of order @xmath115 after taking into account the experimental constraints , there could be large deviations of the @xmath0 asymmetry , @xmath116 , from the sm prediction .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the charged higgs contribution to @xmath49 could be comparable in size to the sm effect , and this basically sets free the ckm angles @xmath117 and @xmath74 .",
    "when @xmath117 and @xmath74 take negative values , the @xmath0 asymmetry in @xmath118 can be of opposite sign relative to the sm expectation .",
    "the cp asymmetry in the present model is illustrated in fig .  2 for three representative choices of @xmath74 .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , @xmath119 can take almost any value in the t2hdm .",
    "2.5 truein    .2 cm",
    "the analysis for @xmath118 can be straightforwardly extended to other @xmath2 decay modes @xcite . of particular interest are those decays where the sm prediction for the cp asymmetry is zero or very small .",
    "these include @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and some others . in the t2hdm , it is not hard to see that the @xmath0 asymmetries for these two decays are @xmath122 , and thus could be of order tens of percent .",
    "indeed , a simple @xmath0-violating pattern can be obtained for the various @xmath2 decays that is quite distinctive from the sm prediction .",
    "the complex , enhanced charm yukawa for @xmath123 provides an interesting scenario for generating a sizable neutron electric dipole moment ( edm ) via a one loop diagram with virtual charm and @xmath106 .",
    "two vertices of the diagram involve charm quarks of opposite chirality in order for the diagram to have an imaginary piece . using the non - relativistic quark model relation between the neutron edm and quark edm , one has , d_n d_d = a || ^4 ( _ ckm - ) ( - ) . taking @xmath29 as the current quark mass and imposing the experimental constraints on the model , we find that the neutron edm can be as large as @xmath124 , not too far below the present experimental limit .",
    "it is worth pointing out that this estimate is valid even if the new phase @xmath40 vanishes , as the @xmath125 mixing always gives the @xmath123 coupling a complex piece that is proportional to @xmath126 .",
    "the top - quark 2hdm provides one example for new @xmath0-violating phases and non - standard charged higgs yukawa couplings which should be generally present in multi - higgs doublet models when natural flavor conservation is not enforced .",
    "although one need not take this particular model too seriously , the interesting phenomenological implications of flavor violation in general deserve further investigation .",
