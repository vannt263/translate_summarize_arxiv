    "let @xmath1 be a probability measure on the real line all of whose moments @xmath2 are finite .",
    "then there are at least three natural families of polynomials associated to such a measure .",
    "the most familiar ones are the orthogonal polynomials @xmath3 .",
    "this is a polynomial family ( that is , @xmath4 has degree @xmath5 ) such that @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "two standard normalizations are to require the polynomials to be monic or to be orthonormal . by the spectral theorem for orthogonal polynomials , such ( monic )",
    "polynomials satisfy a three - term recursion relation @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the jacobi parameters , and @xmath11 . the jacobi parameters and the moments of the measure can be expressed in terms of each other , and their properties related to the properties of the measure and the orthogonal polynomials , for example using the viennot - flajolet theory @xcite .",
    "a typical question in this direction is to find explicitly the _ linearization coefficients _ @xmath12 already the proofs of the positivity of these coefficients are quite subtle @xcite and they are known explicitly only in very rare cases @xcite .",
    "another natural and very classical @xcite polynomial family associated to @xmath1 is its family of appell polynomials , which have the exponential generating function @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the exponential moment generating function of @xmath1 .",
    "it is easy to see that an equivalent definition is via a recursion relation @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "here , @xmath17 are the cumulants ( semi - invariants ) of the measure . unlike the jacobi parameters",
    ", the cumulants are obtained from the moments of the measure via a simple relation @xmath18 ( both sides considered as formal power series ) .",
    "many classical ( non - orthogonal ) polynomial families are appell .",
    "they arise in finite operator calculus @xcite and the study of hypergroups , in numerical analysis ( bernoulli polynomials are appell ) , but also in probability theory , in the study of stochastic processes @xcite , non - central limit theorems @xcite , and natural exponential families @xcite . from the combinatorial point of view",
    ", they have nice linearization and multinomial formulas .",
    "the third family of polynomials has not apparently been explicitly defined before , although it appears implicitly in the paper @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we will call them the kailath - segall polynomials .",
    "these are polynomials in ( infinitely many ) variables @xmath19 .",
    "they are indexed by all finite sequences of natural numbers @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and defined by the recursion @xmath22 with initial conditions @xmath23 , @xmath24 . as usual , @xmath25 means `` omit the @xmath26th term '' .",
    "note that @xmath27 contains a single monomial of the highest degree @xmath28 , namely @xmath29 , and that it is a polynomial in the variables @xmath30 the origin of these polynomials is again in probability theory , where they appear as certain multiple stochastic integrals .",
    "moreover , they share a number of properties with both the orthogonal and the appell polynomials .",
    "their recursion relation is determined by the cumulants , and they have nice linearization properties , just like the appell polynomials .",
    "in fact , we will show that @xmath31 is a linear combination of the kailath - segall polynomials . on the other hand ,",
    "the polynomials @xmath32 also have the following orthogonality property .",
    "define a measure @xmath33 on @xmath34 by specifying its multivariate cumulants : @xmath35 see remark  [ remark : measure ] for the fashion in which the measure @xmath33 is determined by its cumulants .",
    "if @xmath1 is infinitely divisible , @xmath33 is a positive measure .",
    "then @xmath36 if @xmath37 .",
    "a generalization of the appell polynomials are the sheffer polynomials .",
    "let @xmath38 be a function with a formal power series expansion such that @xmath39 .",
    "then the sheffer polynomials are defined via their exponential generating function @xmath40 equivalently , @xmath41 they share with the appell polynomials the multinomial expansion properties and the relation to stochastic processes ( see section  [ subsec : martingales ] ) . among the appell polynomials , only the hermite ones are orthogonal .",
    "meixner s classic characterization @xcite describes all the orthogonal sheffer polynomials .",
    "there are also multivariate versions of this statement @xcite .",
    "we start the paper by describing some properties of and relations between the three aforementioned families of polynomials . in the appell and kailath - segall cases ,",
    "natural starting points are in fact certain multi - linear functionals on more general algebras , which can then be specialized to polynomials .",
    "these families have similar but different properties .",
    "for example , the appell linearization coefficients are sums over non - homogeneous partitions , while the kailath - segall linearization coefficients are sums over inhomogeneous partitions .",
    "a number of the results in section  [ section : classical ] are known and so are stated without proof .",
    "as mentioned above and described in more detail below , both the appell and the kailath - segall polynomials arise in probability theory and are related to the notion of _ independence_. let @xmath42 be a real linear functional on the algebra @xmath43 $ ] of polynomials in two variables .",
    "then @xmath44 are independent with respect to @xmath42 if for any @xmath45 , @xmath46 } = { \\varphi \\left [ p(x ) \\right ] } { \\varphi \\left [ q(y ) \\right]}.\\ ] ] in the early 1980 s , dan voiculescu introduced a parallel but really very different notion of _ free independence _ @xcite .",
    "let @xmath42 now be a real linear functional on the algebra @xmath47 of polynomials in two _ non - commuting _ variables .",
    "then @xmath44 are freely independent with respect to @xmath42 if whenever @xmath48 } = { \\varphi \\left [ q_1(y ) \\right ] } = \\ldots = { \\varphi \\left [ p_n(x ) \\right ] } = { \\varphi \\left [ q_n(y ) \\right ] } = 0\\ ] ] and @xmath49 each are either centered or scalar , then @xmath50 } = 0.\\ ] ] a whole theory of _ free probability _",
    "@xcite , based on this notion , is by now quite well developed .",
    "it turns out that there are `` free analogs of '' the appell and kailath - segall polynomials , which , very roughly , are obtained by replacing commuting variables with non - commuting ones , exponential generating functions with the usual ones , and exponentials with resolvents .",
    "such a replacement , however , is quite non - trivial .",
    "the analysis of the preceding section is repeated in section  [ section : free ] for the free case , except that in this case most of the results are new .",
    "for the free appell polynomials , we find an explicit form of the generating function and various recursion and `` diagram '' formulas .",
    "as expected , these formulas are in most cases based on the lattice of non - crossing , rather than all , set partitions ( but not always , compare for example equation   with proposition  [ prop : free - appell](c ) ) . for the free sheffer polynomials",
    ", we find a necessary condition for them to be pseudo - orthogonal .",
    "consequences of these results for free probability will be developed elsewhere .",
    "comparison of formulas from the preceding two sections shows that many of them appear as particular cases of @xmath0-interpolated forms , with the usual case corresponding to @xmath51 and the free case corresponding to @xmath52 . on the other hand",
    ", many other formulas do not appear to admit of such an interpolation . in section  [ section : q ] , we define the @xmath0-appell and @xmath0-kailath - segall polynomials , and show that some of their properties carry over to the whole interpolated family .",
    "some of the other properties , at least at present , do not .",
    "therefore this section is necessarily more tentative than the preceding ones .",
    "we only consider single - variable @xmath0-appell polynomials , and find an explicit form of the generating function for them , as well as the @xmath0-analogs of the meixner families .",
    "for the @xmath0-kailath - segall polynomials , we find various recursion and `` diagram '' formulas .",
    "finally , in the appendix we show that @xmath0-appell polynomials are not linear combinations of the @xmath0-kailath - segall polynomials , unlike in the classical and the free case . as a consequence",
    ", they can not be martingale polynomials for the @xmath0-lvy processes .",
