    "electronic structure calculations are becoming more widely applied to increasingly complex and realistic materials systems and devices , reaching well into the domain of nanotechnology with applications ranging from metal - molecule junctions , carbon - nanotube field effect transistors , and nanostructured metals or semiconductors.@xcite for such complex applications , characterizing the properties of the elementary building blocks becomes of fundamental importance .",
    "consider nanoscale constructions such as self assembled monolayers , where the underlying metal work function ( and fermi energy ) are crucial to determining interfacial phenomena.@xcite thus , it becomes critical to have a clear understanding of the fundamental properties of the metal lead surfaces  starting from surface energies , structural relaxations , and work functions .",
    "it is also important to highlight the limitations of density functional theory when considering even only the building blocks , in this case with regard to surface properties of metals . in general local and semi - local approximations for the exchange - correlation",
    "functional perform well for metals , however this is not the case for metal surfaces.@xcite for this purpose we proceed here with a detailed study of the properties of clean metal surfaces of interest , as lead materials , to nanotechnological applications , and discuss the issues involved in obtaining converged estimates using electronic - structure modeling - in this case using density - functional theory ( dft ) and the slab - supercell approximation - and the accuracy of these estimates compared to experimental values .",
    "first , surface relaxations can arise from the creation of a new surface ",
    "i.e. cleaving of a bulk in two .",
    "this leads to a smoothing of the charge density at the new surface which causes a net force on the outermost surface layer of ions pointing into the bulk.@xcite dft calculations in the slab - supercell approximation , assuming a pristine unit cell of the unreconstructed surface , can be effectively used to study these surface layer relaxations .",
    "second , the surface energy is the energy required to cleave an infinite crystal in two ",
    "i.e. the amount of energy required to create a new surface .",
    "this is a difficult quantity to determine experimentally because it usually requires measuring surface tension at the melting temperature of the metal.@xcite theoretical determination of this quantity is relatively easy and particularly useful in studies of the relative stability of different surface facets.@xcite however surface energy calculations within dft are sensitive to numerical errors arising from differences in brillouin - zone sampling.@xcite methodologies for avoiding these errors have been proposed in the literature@xcite and are discussed in later sections of this study .",
    "third , the work function is the minimum energy needed to remove an electron from the bulk of a material through a surface to a point outside the material . in practice",
    ", this is the energy required at @xmath0 k to remove an electron from the fermi level of the metal to the vacuum potential.@xcite calculations of work function using dft employ this definition and determine the fermi energy and vacuum potential from calculations of the metals in slab - supercell geometries .",
    "however , work functions calculated with slab approximations are known to have a dependency on the thickness of the slab , thus further analysis is required to extract bulk metal work functions from slab approximation .",
    "this dependency is well documented in some cases and is attributed to finite size effects arising from classical electrostatic interactions or from quantum size effects ( qse).@xcite methodology to lessen such effects is available in the literature.@xcite    in this paper we calculate the relaxations , surface energies , and work functions of the ( 111 ) , ( 100 ) , and ( 110 ) surfaces of al , pd , pt , and au and the ( 0001 ) surface of ti within dft . we examine the convergence of all three quantities with respect to the thickness of the slabs , following the surfaces of pd as an example .",
    "furthermore , we employ and compare a number of different methods of calculation with respect to surface energy and work function .",
    "well - converged values of these quantities for all of the metals and surfaces of this study are tabulated and compared , when available , to experimental quantities and/or dft - lda quantities from the literature .",
    "some of the lda generated data from the literature , and compared to here , were calculated with surface green s functions methodologies.@xcite these methods have been shown to be highly accurate , as well as inherently free from finite - size effects due to choices of boundary conditions .",
    "however , we feel that the flexibility and popularity of plane - wave dft methods for more complex systems highlights the necessity for comparison of methods and functionals with well converged slab - supercell calculated quantities .",
    "first - principles calculations within density functional theory are carried out using the pwscf code of the quantum - espresso distribution.@xcite the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) functional within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) is used.@xcite for the brillouin - zone integration , we use a monkhorst - pack set of special * k*-points,@xcite and marzari - vanderbilt smearing @xcite with a broadening of 0.02 ryd .",
    "ultrasoft pseudopotentials ( uspp ) are used for pd , pt , and au . for",
    "the case of pd and pt the uspps used have been generated with the rrkj3 scheme @xcite with 10 valence electrons each in 4d@xmath15s@xmath2 and 5d@xmath16s@xmath2 configurations , respectively .",
    "the au uspp have also been generated with the rrkj3 scheme with 11 valence electrons in a 5d@xmath36s@xmath2 configuration .",
    "for the case of ti the uspp was generated using the vanderbilt scheme @xcite with 12 valence electrons in a 3s@xmath43p@xmath54s@xmath43d@xmath4 configuration .",
    "a normconserving pseudopotential is used for al with electrons in a 3s@xmath63p@xmath2 configuration .",
    "the kinetic energy cutoff for the plane wave basis are 32 ryd for the wave function and 512 ryd for the charge density for al , pd , pt , and au .",
    "for ti these values are 40 ryd and 640 ryd , respectively .",
    "surfaces were constructed using a supercell with a thin slab of metal separated from its periodic images by a layer of vacuum .",
    "the size of this region is such that there are always @xmath7 of vacuum between the surfaces .",
    "for all the slabs considered , each layer in the unit cell contains one in - equivalent atom . for ( 111 ) surfaces a hexagonal cell with a base defined by @xmath8 $ ] and @xmath9 $ ] and an inter - layer spacing of @xmath10 and a stacking of abcabc",
    "is used , where @xmath11 is the equilibrium lattice parameter .",
    "the other surfaces are similarly constructed ; for ( 100 ) a tetragonal cell is used with a base formed by @xmath12 $ ] and @xmath13 $ ] where the inter - layer spacing is @xmath14 and abab stacking .",
    "the ( 110 ) surface is constructed from an orthorhombic cell with a base defined by @xmath12 $ ] and @xmath15 $ ] with an inter - layer spacing of @xmath16 and abab stacking . for the case of ti",
    "the hexagonal cell is used with a abab stacking in the @xmath17-direction .",
    "the remaining methodological items are discussed in the following results section .",
    "we calculate the lattice parameters and bulk moduli for al , pd , pt , au , and ti .",
    "the calculations are performed for the total energy of the bulk system for a range of lattice parameters @xmath18 .",
    "the total energy data are fit with the murnaghan equation of state@xcite to obtain the bulk moduli . for the case of bulk ti , a hexagonal cell is used with a two atom basis to construct the hexagonal close packed ( hcp ) structure .",
    "total energy calculations are performed for a range of @xmath19 ratios and each of them fit with the murnaghan equation of state .",
    "the results are found in table [ tab : lat ] .",
    "here we see that the lattice parameters of the fcc al , pd , pt , and au are over estimated ( @xmath20 ) by the use of the pbe - gga exchange correlation functional .",
    "similarly , for the bulk moduli the calculated values are underestimated with respect to the experimental values . however , for the calculations of these properties of ti , pbe slightly overestimates the volume of the unit cell as well as over - estimating the bulk modulus .",
    "this type of behavior can be seen in a study of similar metals when calculated using the pbe functional and a full potential linear augmented plane wave ( flapw ) all electron methodology.@xcite from the same flapw study , we see good agreement with our pseudopotential calculations for the lattice parameters ( within 0.03 ) and the bulk moduli ( within 5 gpa ) of al , pd , and pt.@xcite the remainder of this work the equilibrium lattice parameters calculated with pbe , found in table [ tab : lat ] , are used .    recently in the literature",
    ", it has been shown that pd calculated within gga is incorrectly described as having a magnetic ground state in the bulk.@xcite to this end we also have calculated the bulk and surface properties of pd with spin - polarization .",
    "we also find that the ground state is described as magnetic , however , when applied to the surface properties , the introduction of magnetism has a small effect .",
    "these calculations are reported and discussed in the appendix of this paper .",

    "calculations of the relaxations , surface energies , and work functions of low index metallic surfaces were made for the ( 100 ) , ( 110 ) , and ( 111 ) surfaces of al , pd , pt , and au and the ( 0001 ) surface of ti using finite slab approximations .",
    "we have paid particular attention to the issues that arise from slab thickness and consequently finite size effects , and we have shown that convergence of these quantities can be achieved for slab thicknesses that are greater than 6-layers for ( 111),(100 ) , and ( 0001 ) surfaces and 10-layers for ( 110 ) surfaces .",
    "we find that the use of bulk references for calculations of surface energies and work functions can be detrimental to convergence , especially when surface relaxations are being considered .",
    "we compared our results within the gga with experimental and lda results from the literature .",
    "our results and comparison have shown that , even though converged values can be achieved , calculated values do not match well quantitatively to experimental values",
    ". this may be understandable for the surface relaxations and surface energies , where even the experimental values have some room for interpretation .",

    "recent calculations in the literature have shown that when evaluated within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) pd yields an erroneous magnetic bulk ground state.@xcite in light of these observations we have performed a similar evaluation of the ground state of pd using pbe - gga and the pseudopotential mentioned in the text of this paper . in a similar manner to alexandre _ et al .",
    "_ we find also a magnetic ground state for bulk pd .",
    "we plot both the total energy and the total magnetization as a function of fcc lattice parameter for pd evaluated with gga in fig [ fig : pdm1 ] and for comparison the same plot is generated for pd within lda in fig [ fig : pdm2 ] .",
    "finally , we have calculated the surface properties of the pd(100 ) with spin - polarization . in all cases",
    "the slab maintains a total magnetization , however , this has little effect on the converged surface properties discussed in the body of this paper .",
