    "the radiative era of cosmic evolution comprises the period from the end of primeval nucleosynthesis to the decoupling of matter and radiation ( see refs @xcite to @xcite ) .",
    "a gross description of cosmological matter sources in this period is given by an interactive mixture of ideal relativistic and non relativistic gases ( `` radiation '' and `` matter '' ) in local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "the standard approach to this type of matter source is either a flrw spacetime whith equilibrium kinetic theory distributions@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , gauge invariant perturbations on a flrw background @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and various types of hydrodynamical models , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite which , in general , fail to incorporate a physically plausible description of the interaction between matter and radiation . even if we argue that the universe is `` almost flrw '' or `` almost in thermal equilibrium '' , the small deviations from equilibrium are extremely important , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , to account for most interesting phenomena of cosmic evolution : nucleosynthesis , structure formation , abundance of relic gases , etc .",
    "models with perfect fluid sources , whether hydrodynamic , @xcite , @xcite , or based on kinetic theory , @xcite , necessarily assume a quasi - static adiabatic and reversible evolution and thus , fail to incorporate into the resulting picture even small deviations from equilibrium .",
    "dissipative sources have been incorporated numerically within a purely flrw geometry @xcite or following a perturbative approach @xcite .",
    "however , the literature still lacks an alternative hydrodynamical treatment , based on inhomogeneous exact solutions of einstein s equations with dissipative sources and fully complying with the thermodynamics of a radiative gas within a transient regime .",
    "ideally , such exact models should include all dissipative agents ( heat flux , bulk and shear viscosity ) and should be consistent with the theoretical framework of extended irreversible thermodynamics ( see refs @xcite to @xcite ) , thus satisfying suitable transport equations complying with causality , with phenomenological coefficients given by kinetic theory for this type of source .",
    "since this general treatment would be mathematically untractable , we aim at the best possible approach based on exact solutions of einstein s equations .",
    "therefore , we have made the following simplifying assumptions : ( a ) the matter source is a fluid with shear viscosity but without heat conduction nor bulk viscosity , ( b ) the equilibrium state variables satisfy the equation of state of a mixture of relativistic and non - relativistic ideal gases , where the internal energy and pressure of the latter have been neglected , ( c ) the particle numbers of each mixture components is independently conserved , ( d ) we exclude dark matter and/or exotic particles and assume instead a tight coupling between photons ( radiation ) and baryons and electrons ( matter ) , hence there is a common temperature for the mixture ( lte ) , while the microscopical interaction models are the various processes of radiative transfer , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite : thomson scattering , brehmstrallung , free - free absortion , etc .",
    "although this type of interactions involve mostly photons and electrons , the dynamics of the matter component is governed by the baryons since the latter provide most of the rest mass content of non - relativistic matter ( without dark matter )",
    ".    restrictions ( b ) and ( c ) are easy to justify : since the ratio of photons to baryons is such a large number ( @xmath6 ) , we can truly ignore the pressure of non - relativistic matter .",
    "also , after nucleosynthesis , in the temperature range @xmath7 , matter creation and anhilitation processes balance each other and effectively cease to be dynamically important @xcite , @xcite . on the other hand , the lack of heat conduction ( restriction ( a ) ) is more difficult to justify . it can be associated with an adiabatic ( zero heat flux ) but still irreversible evolution ( nonzero viscosity ) , and can be a reasonable approximation on specific conditions .",
    "for example , for a radiative gas at higher temperatures shear viscosity dominates over heat conduction , but the latter becomes significant as the mixture cools@xcite .",
    "the lack of bulk viscosity is a better approximation : it is negligible for a radiative gas in the temperature range @xmath8 that we are interested , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , becoming important for higher temperatures ( the mid relativistic regime where @xmath9 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , we accept that ignoring these dissipative fluxes weakens the scope and validity of the models , but we argue that this is compensated by the simplification of the field equations , leading to exact forms for the equilibrium state variables and shear viscosity that still satisfy ( under the restrictions mentioned ) thermodynamically consistent relations .",
    "the models we present are based on the spherically symmetric lematre - tolman - bondi metrics , usually associated with dust sources @xcite , @xcite . however ,",
    "this metric is compatible with a comoving fluid source with zero heat flux but with anisotropic stresses , which we describe as shear viscosity .",
    "obviously , the lack of heat flux and 4-acceleration necessarily implies a very special shear viscous tensor whose divergence exactly balances the nonzero spatial gradient of the equilibrium pressure . considering this metric and this source , we impose on the equilibrium state variables the equation of state for a mixture of ideal gases ( under the restriction ( b ) ) .",
    "the field equations can be solved up to a quadrature , without having to make any assumption on the form of the shear viscous pressure .",
    "the latter , as well as all equilibrium state variables can be determined from the solution of the quadrature , up to two initial value functions that can be identified with the initial energy densities of the matter and radiation components .",
    "we consider only the case that would be equivalent to spacelike sections of zero curvature .",
    "a generalization of this class of exact solutions to the more general szekeres - szafron metrics admitting no isometries has been published recently @xcite , while the study of a non - relativistic ideal gas is considered in @xcite .",
    "once the field equations have been integrated , we define a set of initial value functions that gauge the deviation from homogeneity of the average of initial density contrasts . the terms involving various gradients of metric functions can be given in terms of these gauges , so that in the limit when the latter vanish a flrw spacetime can always be obtained as the homogeneous ( and reversible ) subcase . in section vii",
    "we derive the conditions that the models must satisfy in order to be consistent with the theoretical framework of irreversible extended thermodynamics , in the case where shear viscosity is the only dissipative agent and the coefficient of shear viscosity is that given by kinetic theory for the radiative gas @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this leads to an entropy balance law and a suitable transport equation for shear viscosity that is satisfied for a specific functional form of the relaxation time .",
    "conditions are given so that the latter quantity behaves as a relaxation parameter for an interactive cosmological mixture of matter and radiation .",
    "these conditions of thermodynamical consistency are then explicitly tested on the models , leading to a set of restrictions on the initial conditions ( the latter given in terms of the gauges of initial density constrasts ) .",
    "the most relevant result is that thermodynamical consistency constrains an initial value adimensional function , @xmath0 , which in the limit of small density contrasts is approximately the average gradient of the photon entropy per baryon along the initial hypersurface @xmath10 .",
    "an analogy is provided with the theory of perturbations on a flrw background , whereby @xmath11 is formally analogous to the definition of initialy adiabatic perturbations in the sincronous gauge @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the constraints on the observed anisotropy of the microwave cosmic background , as well as the condition that decopling occurs at @xmath12 , leads to the estimated value @xmath4 . since initial conditions of the radiative era should be traced to previous periods of cosmic evolution , this constraint can be related to maximal bounds on entropy fluctuations in primordial perturbations . finally , we compute the jeans mass associated with the thermodynamically consistent models , leading to a value similar to that obtained for baryon dominated perturbation models : @xmath13 .",
    "a radiation - matter mixture can be described by a mixture of two ideal gases : one an ultra - relativistic gas of massless particles , the other a non - relativistic ideal monatomic gas with @xmath14 being the mass of the particles .",
    "this is characterized by the total matter energy , @xmath15 and pressure @xmath16    @xmath17 @xmath18    where @xmath19 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath20 are particle number densities and temperatures of the two components , distiguished by the superindices @xmath21 ( `` matter '' ) and @xmath22 ( `` radiation '' ) . if there is local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) between the components , the latter interact and evolve with the same temperature : @xmath23 .",
    "if the components are decoupled , each gas evolves with a different temperature .    assuming lte , if @xmath24 , but the ratio @xmath25 is not negligible , then equations ( 1 ) can be approximated by    @xmath26 @xmath27    an equation of state describing a radiation dominated mixture in which the presence of non - relativistic matter is dynamically important .",
    "if we assume non - relativistic matter to be made up of baryons ( with @xmath14 being a protonic mass ) and since the ratio of baryons to photons @xmath28 is a small number , the equation of state ( 2 ) is a reasonable approximation in the temperature range @xmath29 , characteristic of the  radiative era \" from the end of nucleosynthesis to the transition between radiation to matter dominance , including the recombination and decoupling eras . at such temperatures , it is also safe to assume , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite that electrons and photons interact mostly through thomson scattering but creation and annihilation processes ( bremsstrahlung and free - free absorption ) roughly compensated one another so that particle number densities of the components of the mixture satisfy independent conservation laws .",
    "once the decoupling of the matter - radiation mixture takes place at about @xmath30 k , the assumption of lte is no longer valid and interaction between components ceases .",
    "equation of state ( 1 ) can also be approximated by a form similar ( 2 ) with the internal energy of radiation taking approximately the stefan - boltzmann law : @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the radiation constant .",
    "however , out of thermal equilibrium the steffan - boltzmann law is incompatible with the ideal gas equation of state .",
    "having in mind the conditions justifying ( 2 ) , we will describe a matter - radiation mixture evolving along adiabatic but irreversible processes by the fluid tensor    @xmath33 @xmath34    where : @xmath35 satisfy ( 2 ) , @xmath36 is the 4-velocity shared by radiation and matter , @xmath37 is the shear viscous pressure tensor ( a symmetric traceless tensor ) which arises because of the matter - radiation interaction , and particle number densities satisfy the conservation laws    @xmath38    as mentioned previously , bulk viscosity is negligible within the temperature range we are interested in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , while even if neglection of heat conduction can be justified for relativistic temperatures@xcite , it does weaken the scope of the models .",
    "however , this restriction is compensated by the obtention of exact solutions that are still thermodynamically consistent .",

    "<S> we derive a new class of exact solutions of einstein s equations providing a physically plausible hydrodynamical description of cosmological matter in the radiative era , between nucleosynthesis and decoupling . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions are characterized by the lematre - tolman - bondi metric with a viscous fluid source , subjected to the following conditions : ( a ) the equilibrium state variables satisfy the equation of state of a mixture of an ultra - relativistic and a non - relativistic ideal gases , where the internal energy of the latter has been neglected , ( b ) the particle numbers of the mixture components are independently conserved , ( c ) the viscous stress is consistent with the transport equation and entropy balance law of extended irreversible thermodynamics , with the coefficient of shear viscosity provided by kinetic theory . </S>",
    "<S> the fulfilment of ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) restricts initial conditions in terms of an initial value function , @xmath0 , which in the limit of small density contrasts becomes the average of spatial gradients of the fluctuations of photon entropy per baryon in the initial hypersurface . for @xmath1 and choosing the phenomenological coefficients of the `` radiative gas '' model </S>",
    "<S> , we have an interactive photon - baryon mixture under local thermal equilibrium , with radiation dominance and temperatures characteristic of the radiative era ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> constraints on the observed anisotropy of the microwave cosmic radiation and the condition that decoupling occurs at @xmath3 k yield an estimated value : @xmath4 which can be associated with a bound on promordial entropy fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the jeans mass at decoupling is of the same order of magnitude as that of baryon dominated perturbation models ( @xmath5 ) . </S>"
