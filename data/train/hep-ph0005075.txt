    "recent neutrino oscillation experiments suggest the strong evidences of tiny neutrino masses and lepton flavor mixings@xcite .",
    "studies of the lepton flavor mixing matrix , which is so - called maki - nakagawa - sakata(mns ) matrix@xcite , will give us important cues of the physics beyond the standard model .",
    "one of the most important studies is the analysis of the quantum correction on the mns matrix@xcite@xcite .    in order to explain both the solar and the atmospheric neutrino problems ,",
    "two mass squared differences are needed , which implies @xmath5 where @xmath3 is the @xmath4-th ( @xmath6 ) generation neutrino mass ( @xmath7 ) . @xmath8 and @xmath9 stand for the mass - squared differences of the solar neutrino @xcite and the atmospheric neutrino solutions@xcite , respectively .",
    "then there are the following three possible types of neutrino mass hierarchies @xcite ; @xmath10 where @xmath3 is the @xmath4-th generation neutrino absolute mass . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been studied whether the lepton - flavor mixing angles are stable or not against quantum corrections for all three types of mass hierarchies with all considerable relative sign assignments , which are shown below , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with an effective dimension - five operator which gives the majorana masses of neutrinos .    1 .   type a : @xmath11 @xmath12 2 .",
    "type b : @xmath13 @xmath14 3 .",
    "type c : @xmath15 @xmath16    in ref.@xcite , it has been found that the above relative sign assignments of neutrino masses in each type play the crucial roles for the stability of the mixing angles against quantum corrections .",
    "actually , two physical majorana phases in the lepton flavor mixing matrix connect among the above relative sign assignments of neutrino masses .",
    "therefore , in this paper we analyze the stability of mixing angles against quantum corrections according to three types of neutrino mass hierarchies ( type a , b , c ) and two majorana phases .",
    "two phases play the crucial roles for the stability of the mixing angles against the quantum corrections . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it has been already analyzed that the effect of a majorana phase plays an important role for the stability against the quantum corrections in the two - generation neutrinos .",
    "in the mssm with the effective dimension - five operator which gives majorana masses of neutrinos , the superpotential of the lepton - higgs interactions is given by @xmath17 here the indices @xmath18 @xmath19 stand for the generation number . @xmath20 and @xmath21 are chiral super - fields of @xmath4-th generation lepton doublet and right - handed charged - lepton , respectively .",
    "@xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is the higgs doublet which gives dirac masses to the up- ( down- ) type fermions .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix of the three generations , @xmath24 is diagonalized as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 with @xmath7 .",
    "the unitary matrix @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 denote the physical majorana phases of the lepton sector . in the diagonal base of charged lepton masses",
    ", @xmath28 is just the mns matrix .",
    "we can easily show that one majorana phase connects between cases of ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) , ( b1 ) and ( b2 ) , and two majorana phases connect among cases of ( c1)@xmath31(c4 ) .",
    "thus , the stabilities of mixing angles against quantum corrections are completely determined by three types of neutrino mass hierarchies ( type a , b , c ) and two majorana phases @xmath30 in stead of the classifications of eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : a1 ] ) @xmath31 ( [ eqn : c4 ] )",
    ".    we will analyze whether the lepton flavor mixing angles are changed or not by the quantum corrections by fitting the low energy data .",
    "we determine the mns matrix at @xmath32 scale as @xmath33 where we input @xmath34 and @xmath35 which values are suitable for the atmospheric neutrino experiments @xcite and for the chooz experiment @xcite , respectively .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath36 depends on the solar neutrino solutions of the large angle msw solution ( msw - l ) , the small angle msw solution ( msw - s ) and vacuum oscillation solution ( vo ) , which are given by @xmath37    we also use the following values of mass - squared differences in the numerical analyses . @xmath38",
    "the quantum corrections change the neutrino mass matrix , and it is given by scale are written with @xmath39",
    "mark.]@xcite @xmath40 at the high energy scale @xmath41 , where @xmath42 can be estimated as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the yukawa coupling of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 are vacuum expectation values of higgs bosons , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively ) .",
    "we neglect the yukawa couplings of @xmath52 and @xmath53 in eqs.([k ] ) and ( [ def_eta ] ) , since those contributions to the renormalization group equations are negligibly small comparing to that of @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath42 can be determined by the value of @xmath54 and the scale of @xmath41 .",
    "the unitary matrix @xmath55 which diagonalizes @xmath56 shows us whether the lepton flavor mixing angles are stable against quantum corrections or not .",
    "in both ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) cases , all mixing angles are stable against quantum corrections in each sign assignment @xcite .",
    "this is understood from the analogy of two - generation analysis , which shows the mixing angle of @xmath58 mass matrix is not changed drastically by the quantum corrections when there is the large mass hierarchy between two neutrinos @xcite .",
    "this situation is not changed when we consider the majorana phase contribution as shown in two - generation neutrinos @xcite .",
    "cases ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) are connected with each other by the majorana phase of @xmath59 . where @xmath60 is rotated out , since @xmath61 .",
    "the case of @xmath62 corresponds to ( a1 ) , while the case of @xmath63 corresponds to ( a2 ) .",
    "since type a has the large mass hierarchies , all mixing angles are supposed to be stable against quantum corrections independently of the value of the majorana phase @xmath59 .",
    "this is really confirmed by numerical analyses as shown in table [ tbl : typea ] , where we use @xmath64 gev and @xmath65 .",
