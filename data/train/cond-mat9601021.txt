    "large optical singularities in the absorption and emission spectra have been observed by calleja et .",
    "@xcite in semiconductor quantum wire structures in the extreme quantum limit when only the lowest one  dimensional ( 1d ) subband is occupied by electrons .",
    "the pronounced features in the optical spectra have been interpreted as strong fermi ",
    "edge singularities ( fes ) of the 1d electron gas .",
    "the fes arises ( e.g. for absorption ) , because the optical process is accompanied by a multiple scattering of the conducting electrons on a hole in the valence band , which is created at the absorption of the electro  magnetic wave and acts as an impurity  like center . in the case of 1d geometry",
    "the scattering of the conducting electrons by the hole is limited to scattering in the forward or backward directions .",
    "another special feature is related to the electron ",
    "electron interaction in 1d .",
    "in contrast to higher dimensions , the 1d electron gas can not be treated as an ordinary fermi liquid even when the electron ",
    "electron interaction is small .",
    "the experiment @xcite initiated a number of papers discussing the fes in 1d metallic systems for the forward scattering @xcite and the backward one @xcite in the presence of the electron ",
    "electron interaction .    in the present paper",
    "the effect of the backward scattering on the fes in 1d will be reconsidered .",
    "the exponent of the 1d fes obtained here appears to be different from the one that was found in ref.s @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the infrared physics of the fermi  edge singularity in the presence of backward scattering together with electron  electron repulsion resembles the physics of the kondo problem .",
    "this aspect of the problem was missed in the preceding studies .",
    "fes or mahan singularity is a power law singularity in the electro  magnetic wave absorption ( or emission )",
    "coefficient when the frequency is close to the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "that is in contrast to a naive expectation that the absorption coefficient is zero bellow the fermi energy and is proportional to the density of states of the conduction band above the fermi energy . since in common metals",
    "the fes is observed in the @xmath0ray range , it is also called sometimes the @xmath0ray singularity .",
    "the singularity arises because the absorption is accompanied by the infrared catastrophe phenomena .",
    "when the electro  magnetic wave is absorbed , an electron from a deep level is excited to the conduction band and , correspondingly , a hole is created deep in the valence band .",
    "the abrupt appearance of the scattering potential of the deep hole leads to excitation of an infinite number of low energy electron ",
    "hole pairs in the conduction band . besides , the electron excited from the deep level to the conduction band scatters multiply on the hole . the latter process , which includes an exchange with other electrons of the conduction band , leads to enhancement of the absorption coefficient .",
    "the physical reason of this enhancement is the increase of the effective density of states near the deep hole due to its attraction of electrons . on the other hand the creation of the electron ",
    "hole pairs in the conduction band reflects the fact that the final state of the electrons in the presence of the deep hole potential is orthogonal to the initial state .",
    "this process is called the orthogonality catastrophe of anderson @xcite and it leads to a reduction of the absorption coefficient .",
    "the value of the exponent of the fes is determined by these two competing effects .",
    "the effects related to the physics of the fes can be found in various situation where a sudden change of a scattering potential happens .",
    "the well known example is the kondo problem describing scattering of conduction electrons on a magnetic impurity .",
    "when the impurity spin is flipped the impurity potential on which the conduction electrons are scattered is abruptly altered .",
    "therefore , the kondo problem can be treated as a response of the electrons on a sequence of sudden changes of the local scattering potential .",
    "the problem can be mapped on a classical coulomb gas theory of alternating positive and negative charges ( spin flips ) with logarithmic interaction . in the present paper",
    "it will be shown that the fes problem in 1d can also be analyzed by mapping it on a coulomb gas theory , similarly to the kondo problem .    to calculate the exponent of the fes it is needed to sum a series of infrared  divergent logarithmic terms .",
    "a corresponding theory was developed for three dimensional metals ( 3d ) by nozires and collaborators in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "the recoil of the hole , due to its finite mass , together with auger processes lead to a natural cutoff of the infrared singularities .",
    "it is usually assumed , for simplicity , at the discussion of the fes that these effects can be neglected .",
    "the other common assumption is that the potential created by the deep hole is a short range one . that is because the electron screening develops on short scales , while at studies of infrared phenomena large distances",
    "are essential .",
    "since in 3d metals the fermi liquid parameters are determined by the short scale physics , it is also generally assumed that one can use the fermi liquid description for the conduction electrons at the consideration of the fes .    at studies of the fes in 1d",
    "the role of these common assumptions may change .",
    "it has been noticed @xcite that in 1d systems the recoil of the deep hole does not suppress the fes , at least for the forward scattering . here",
    "we will ignore the recoil effects completely as well as the auger processes . in this paper",
    "we will also not discuss the problem of screening of the potential of the deep hole , despite that it may be essential for the fes in modulation  doped quantum wires .",
    "since we are mainly interested now in the effects of the @xmath1backward scattering , it will be assumed that the potential of the deep hole is local .",
    "the most intriguing aspect of fes in 1d is related to the role of the electron ",
    "electron interaction . in some sense",
    "the fermi surface is weakened in 1d as a result of the interaction of electrons . in the case of the tomonaga",
    " luttinger model the jump in the occupation numbers of electrons at the fermi energy is replaced by a singularity , and there are no single electron quasi ",
    "particles @xcite . since the fes is a fermi surface effect , the investigation of the role of the electron ",
    "electron interaction in this problem is of clear interest .",
    "the effective way to investigate the infrared properties of the 1d electron systems is the bosonization technique .",
    "in fact , the important step in the developing of this technique was made just in connection with the problem of the fes .",
    "schotte and schotte extended the approach of ref . @xcite and developed a very compact and economical description of the fes for @xmath2-wave scattering in 3d @xcite . in the present paper the consideration of the electrons interaction",
    "will be confined to the tomonaga  luttinger model where it is assumed that the electrons do not scatter backward in the course of the electron  electron interactions . since tomonaga ",
    "luttinger model has a simple solution in the bosonization technique , it is natural to apply that technique for finding the fes in 1d in the presence of interactions between the electrons .    in the case",
    "when at the scattering on the potential of the hole in the valence band the electrons are scattered only in the forward direction , the fes can be found @xcite following the schotte and schotte method .",
    "for completeness of the presentation and with the purpose of introducing notations we have reconsidered this case in sec . [ se : fs ] .",
    "when the backward scattering on the hole potential is included , it is shown in sec .",
    "[ se : bs ] that the problem can be mapped on a gas of charged particles , similarly to the coulomb gas mapping in the kondo problem .",
    "the role of the spin flip in the kondo problem acts now the change of the electron motion from left to right and visa versa at the backward scattering on the hole . in comparison with the kondo problem the coulomb gas describing",
    "the 1d fes is different in two aspects . in the @xmath3 kondo problem",
    "successive flips should follow alternatively , while in the case of fes there is no limitations on the order of left  right and right  left scattering .",
    "( in the end of sec . [",
    "se : ri ] a certain relationship of the non alternating coulomb gas with the two  channel kondo problem is outlined . )",
    "the other difference is due to the creation of the additional electron in the conduction band at the absorption of the electro  magnetic wave .",
    "this gives rise to two additional charges located at the ends of the coulomb gas system . in the case of repulsion of electrons",
    "the gas of the charged particles is in the hot plasma phase .",
    "therefore a new scale  the screening radius of the plasma  is generated in this problem as a combined effect of the backward scattering and the interaction .",
    "the shape of the absorption line for frequencies close enough to the fermi ",
    "edge is controlled by this scale .",
    "the reduction of the 1d fes problem to the classical gas theory yields a value of the fes exponent in the vicinity of the fermi edge , which is different from the one obtained in preceding studies @xcite .    in section [ se : nl ]",
    "the fes is analyzed using fields , which where first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that representation the scattering is simplified , but at a price that the electron ",
    "electron interaction is described by a non  local theory of self  dual fields .",
    "a special treatment is needed in case of such a theory .",
    "the renormalization group analysis of the problem using these variables is elaborated in sec .",
    "[ se : rg ] .",
    "in addition , an iteration procedure is developed in sec .",
    "[ se : qtsp ] for the analysis of the fes problem .",
    "this procedure is useful for determining the screening length of the coulomb gas in the hot plasma phase .",
    "to understand the obtained exponent of the fes , in sec .",
    "[ se : ri ] the result is interpreted in terms of the phase shift theory of nozires and de dominicis @xcite .",
    "it is argued that the discrepancy between the value of the fes exponent obtained in the present paper and the result of ref.s @xcite is because in these papers the asymptotic regime of the problem is described by a weak link junction .",
    "however , two weakly connected wires represent a system with strong depletion of the density of electrons at the defect center .",
    "it is shown in the end of sec . [",
    "se : ri ] that the use of such system as the asymptotic limit description of a weak impurity scatterer , as it was suggested in the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite , is in contradiction with the friedel sum rule .",
    "in fact , it is concluded here that the infrared asymptotic regime of the fes resembles to the kondo resonance .",
    "in this section we show that in 1-d systems the correlation function @xmath4 determining ( after the fourier transform ) the fermi edge singularity can be presented as a product of two terms . the first one is related to the forward scattering of the conduction electrons by the hole , which is created in the valence band at the absorption of the external electro  magnetic wave .",
    "this term can be calculate directly , while the second one describing the backward scattering by the hole , is analyzed by mapping onto a coulomb gas .",
    "this approach allows us to find the behavior of @xmath4 at asymptotically large time . for compactness",
    "we confine the consideration bellow to a spinless case , and the spin degrees of freedom of the conduction electrons are included in the appendix ( [ app ] ) .",
