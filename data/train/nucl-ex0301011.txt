    "double - beta decay ( ) is a nuclear process where the nucleus increases in charge by 2 while emitting 2 electrons . two - neutrino double - beta decay ( ) is an allowed second order weak process that also emits two neutrinos .",
    "zero - neutrino double - beta decay ( ) can only occur if neutrinos are massive particles that are self conjugate ( i.e. massive majorana particles ) .",
    "the recent experimental results from atmospheric@xcite , solar@xcite , and reactor@xcite neutrino sources indicate neutrinos have mass and that they mix .",
    "in particular , at least one neutrino must have a mass greater than about 50 mev .",
    "this very exciting result has greatly renewed the interest in because the next generation experiments aim to reach this target .",
    "in fact of all the experimental techniques to search for neutrino mass , only  experiments can reach an absolute mass value near the 50-mev mass scale indicated by the oscillation experiments .",
    "furthermore , only  has the potential to determine whether the neutrino is its own anti - particle .",
    "this exciting situation and the present experimental and theoretical status has been described in a recent review@xcite and the many references therein .",
    "although any observation of  has always been an exciting possibility , in the not - to - recent past , limits on the majorana mass from the non - observation of  could be interpreted in two distinct ways .",
    "perhaps the neutrino mass was just smaller than the limit . or",
    ", since  is only sensitive to majorana neutrinos , it could be that the neutrino was a dirac particle that has a mass greater than the limit .",
    "now , however , there is a known minimum mass scale for the neutrino .",
    "a null result below this mass scale could eliminate presently - possible mass spectra from having a majorana component .",
    "therefore such a result would be a non - trivial constraint on neutrino properties .",
    "the oscillation results convincingly indicate two mass - difference scales : one at @xmath1 mev@xmath2 at approximately maximal mixing and one at @xmath3 mev@xmath2 at a mixing angle near 30 degrees .",
    "these results indicate that neutrinos do have mass but do not give an indication of the absolute neutrino mass scale or its cp nature .",
    "furthermore , we have little data on the hierarchy of the neutrino masses .",
    "that is we do not know if @xmath4 is predominately composed of the lightest mass eigenstate or not",
    ".  can provide data to address these neutrino properties , but because of possible non - trivial majorana phases in the mixing matrix , we will also require input from kinematic neutrino mass experiments such as katrin@xcite .",
    "therefore , all three types of experiments , oscillation , , and kinematic , are required to completely understand the neutrino .",
    "note that indications of a third mass - difference scale near 1 ev@xmath5 from the lsnd experiment@xcite are as yet unconfirmed .",
    "although i have chosen to ignore that result in this simple discussion , the large mass scale would only add to the interest in  experiments .",
    "the decay rate ( @xmath6 ) of double beta decay is proportional to the square of the effective majorana neutrino mass ( ) , an easily calculable phase space factor ( @xmath7 ) , and a difficult - to - calculate nuclear matrix element ( @xmath8 ) ;    @xmath9    the value for  in turn , depends on the values of the individual neutrino mass eigenstates ( @xmath10 ) , the mixing matrix elements ( @xmath11 ) and the majorana phases ( @xmath12 ) ;    @xmath13    in the case of cp conservation @xmath14 .",
    "if we take @xmath15 , the atmospheric mixing to be maximal , and the solar mixing angle to be about 30 degrees ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) , one can simplify this equation for  and get a feeling as to the sensitivity that  has to the absolute mass scale .",
    "@xmath18    for majorana neutrinos in the normal hierarchy , one finds  values greater than several mev and in the inverse hierarchy one finds values greater than several tens of mev even when the smallest mass eigenstate is near zero .",
    "simply stated , @xmath19 is a very enticing target for  experiments and the recent excitement in  is that the next generation of experiments will be sensitive to  near this target .",
    "to observe , one must reduce backgrounds so that an ultra - low - rate peak can emerge from a continuum of other processes . to reach the desired 50-mev goal ,",
    "significant background improvements are needed .",
    "the backgrounds that currently afflict  experiments can be classified into 3 groups : , natural or man - made radioactivities , and cosmogenicly produced radioactivities .      unlike , the two electrons share the available energy with two neutrinos in the  process .",
    "thus their sum energy spectrum is a distribution up to the endpoint .",
    "( see fig . 1 . )",
    "this spectrum is very steeply falling and , in principle , the region of interest for  should be free of such events .",
    "however , the finite resolution of any detector can result in  events polluting the  region .",
    "an approximate expression@xcite for the  sensitivity limit due to this background can be written    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the q - value , @xmath22 is the width of the region of interest divided by @xmath21 , @xmath23 is the electron mass , @xmath24 is the  phase space factor , @xmath25 is the  phase space factor ,  is the  matrix element and  is the  matrix element .",
    "= 3.5 in    [ twonuspect ]    although this equation does not include the improvement one might get from exploiting other kinematic measurements such as the opening angle or the individual electron energies , it does give an estimate of the resolution requirements .",
    "this equation is plotted for a few isotopes in fig . 2 and one sees that a resolution better a few percent will suffice for the 50-mev goal .",
    "however , if other backgrounds are present and create a continuum through the region of interest , better resolution improves the experimental sensitivity .",
    "= 4.0 in    [ twonuback ]      many  experiments also serve as dark matter searches .",
    "those searches look for the low - energy recoils resulting from elastic scattering of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "the potential background for those searches is more varied than for . because the  endpoint is typically a few mev , many natural radioactivities simply contribute too little energy to pollute that region of interest .",
    "the most important naturally occurring isotopes that are potential backgrounds for  are @xmath26tl and @xmath27bi .",
    "these have large q - values and can pollute the region of interest of almost all  isotopes .",
    "they are members of the natural th and u decay chains and thus common in the environment .",
    "furthermore , they are daughters of the gaseous rn isotopes , which are very mobile .",
    "the th and u half - lives , ( @xmath28 y ) , are much shorter than the required @xmath29 to @xmath30-y sensitivity for the 50-mev goal",
    ". therefore even a tiny amount of these activities are a significant problem . over the past 60 years , experimentalists have made great progress in identifying materials that are very low in th and u. by building their experiments from this limited palate of materials , these activities have been greatly reduced .",
    "improved purification techniques have also helped eliminate these backgrounds .",
    "radon is a special problem because its a gas that emanates from u and th containing compounds and diffuses through many materials also .",
    "experimenters must ensure that the detector volume is kept free of rn .",
    "in many cases a careful flushing of the atmosphere near the inner volume with boil - off gas from liquid nitrogen sufficiently reduces the rn . at ln temperatures ,",
    "rn is frozen out and therefore the boil - off gas is mostly free of rn .",
    "there are techniques to tag tl and bi background events based either on the kinematics of the decay processes or on delayed coincidence timing of the progenitors and daughter members of the natural decay chains .",
    "although there has been great success in reducing backgrounds in this way , all these techniques have some inefficiency .",
    "therefore it is necessary to minimize these activities .",
    "the future proposals will make great efforts to reduce the amount of tl and bi present even if they rely on such tagging techniques .",
    "many isotopes not normally found in nature ( _ e.g. _ @xmath31pu , @xmath32cs , @xmath33sr , @xmath34ar , and @xmath35kr are produced artificially by human activities such as nuclear - weapon testing , nuclear accidents , reactor ventings , etc .",
    "therefore it is necessary for experimenters to consider such exotic possibilities when designing an experiment .",
    "cosmic rays react with a detector and produce signals .",
    "because the cosmic ray flux is so high on the surface of the earth ,  experiments are conducted underground .",
    "any prompt events can be eliminated by going to a deep location and incorporating an anti - coincidence shield .",
    "but in addition to prompt interactions , cosmic rays can produce delayed radioactivity via many nuclear reactions .",
    "in particular , while detector materials or the source resides on the surface of the earth , they are exposed to a significant fast ( @xmath3610 mev ) neutron flux .",
    "these fast neutrons can produce large @xmath37a transitions in nuclei that result in radioactive nuclides .",
    "below ground the fast neutron flux is proportional to the cosmic - ray muon flux , so going deeper reduces it .",
    "for most cases , a few hundred meters will suffice to eliminate the _ in situ _ production and only the residual activity left over from the time spent on the surface will be present .",
    "the most famous example of this effect is that of @xmath38ge in ge detectors . even though the experiments used ge enriched in @xmath39ge , @xmath38ge was produced in the crystals through the high - threshold reaction , @xmath39ge(n,9n)@xmath38ge . in using",
    "enriched ge with little @xmath40ge , experimenters had thought that the @xmath38ge problem would not be present because the required reaction on @xmath39ge had such a large @xmath37a .",
    "although it was significantly decreased , it remained a source of background that will require additional efforts to minimize .    for future experiments that will require sensitivities near 1 event / year in the region of interest in a 1-ton sample , the cosmogenic background possibilities are varied .",
    "because the signal rate is very low in a large target , rare processes must be considered as potential backgrounds .",
    "for example @xmath41mo(n,2n)@xmath42mo would need to be carefully considered for any @xmath43mo experiment using natural mo . for a @xmath44xe experiment trying to identify the @xmath44ba daughter , the two - step process @xmath44xe(@xmath45,p)x and @xmath44xe(p",
    ", n)@xmath44cs produces the 13.1-day cs isotope .",
    "@xmath44cs decays via a 2.55-mev @xmath46 to @xmath44ba .",
    "although it is unlikely that the energies of the @xmath46 and the coincident @xmath47s would sum to the region of interest , it points out how rare ( and sometimes bizarre ) processes must be considered .",
    "the first direct measurement of  used a time projection chamber@xcite .",
    "this was a fairly large apparatus ( @xmath48 m@xmath49 ) for a modest amount of source ( 13 g ) and therefore , it is doubtful that this type of arrangement will represent the best of the next generation of  experiments .",
    "this design does nt scale easily to very large source mass with very low backgrounds .",
    "it is interesting to try to enumerate the features that an ideal  experiment would posses .",
    "it would have the following characteristics :    the detector mass must be large enough to reach our 50-mev goal ( @xmath48 1 ton of isotope )",
    ".    the  source must be extremely low in radioactive contamination .",
    "the proposal must be based on a demonstrated technology for the detection of .",
    "although the use of natural isotope will be less costly , the enrichment process provides a good level of purification and also results in a ( usually ) much smaller volume detector .",
    "a small detector volume minimizes internal backgrounds , which scale with the detector volume .",
    "it also minimizes external backgrounds by minimizing the shield volume for a given stopping power .",
    "this is most easily accomplished by an apparatus whose source is also the detector . alternatively ,",
    "a very large source may have some advantage due to self shielding .",
    "good energy resolution is required to prevent the tail of the  spectrum extending into the  region of interest .",
    "ease of operation is required because these experiments usually operate in remote locations .    a large q value results in a fast  rate and also places the region of interest above many potential backgrounds .",
    "a relatively slow  rate also helps control this background .    identifying the daughter in coincidence with the  decay energy would eliminate most potential backgrounds except .",
    "event reconstruction , providing kinematic data such as opening angle and individual electron energy , can aid in the elimination of backgrounds .",
    "this data might also help elucidate the physics if a statistical sample of  events are observed .",
    "good spatial resolution and timing information can help reject background processes .",
    "the nuclear theory is better understood in some isotopes than others .",
    "the interpretation of limits or signals might be easier to interpret for some isotopes .",
    "no experiment , past or proposed , is able to optimize for all of these characteristics simultaneously .",

    "one intriguing bit of history helps motivate the need for more than one  effort . an early spectrum in a te experiment@xcite saw a peak at the 2.53-mev endpoint with @xmath482@xmath50 confidence .",
    "at a similar point in time , a ge spectrum@xcite showed a peak of unknown origin at the same energy .",

    "the moral of the story is that a peak , by itself , may not suffice to prove an observation of .",

    "in order to determine an effective majorana neutrino mass from a  result , one requires input from nuclear theory .",
    "the matrix elements however are very hard to calculate and the various techniques and authors produce varying results .",
    "reference includes a rather complete list of references and the results of calculation of the matrix elements .",
    "the two techniques for calculating the matrix elements are the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) and the nuclear shell model .",
    "each approach has its advantages and disadvantages and hence critics and advocates . due to this complicated situation , the spread in the calculations is commonly taken as a measure of the theoretical uncertainty .    for a given",
    ", the spread in predicted half - lives is approximately an order of magnitude .",
    "thus the spread in  deduced from a potential  measurement is a factor of 3 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the qualitative physics conclusions arising from an observation of  are so profound , that this factor of 3 is a detail .",
    "however , precise interpretation of any result will be limited due to this spread .",
    "the spread is due to the community s choice to include _ all _ calculations when estimating the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "no consensus has been reached identifying the calculations that are outdated or relatively less precise .",
    "naively , one concludes that the factor of 3 is an overestimate . at present",
    "this uncertainty is large enough that potential conclusions regarding the mass spectrum@xcite or the majorana phases@xcite might be diminished .",
    "improvement in the calculations will have a big payoff if  is observed .",
    "more important , however , is the need for confirmation as described above .",
    "if observations of  are made in two isotopes , a comparison between the two deduced  values might indicate that they are consistent .",
    "obviously this would be strong evidence that  is truly the correct interpretation . for this argument to be persuasive , however , confidence in the theory and its estimated uncertainties must be sufficient that critics concede the two  values are consistent .",
    "encouragingly , the technology available for such calculations has improved , especially the shell model techniques .",
    "the physics motivation for these experiments is very strong , so perhaps interest in the theoretical aspect of this problem will build also .",
    "it is a very exciting time for .",
    "the next generation of experiments will have a sensitivity of about 50 mev for : the critical target of @xmath19 .",
    "therefore future experiments will have a known neutrino mass with which to compare . as a result",
    ", even null experiments will impact the question of whether neutrinos are dirac or majorana in certain mass - spectrum configurations .",
    "after the announcement of the 2002 nobel prize for physics , this conference evolved into a tribute to ray davis and his great achievements that culminated with his winning this prestigious award .",
    "i wish to join the numerous scientists to congratulate him on a spectacular career .",
    "i had the pleasure to collaborate with ray on the russian - american gallium solar neutrino experiment ( sage ) and , therefore , i also wish to thank him personally for his inspiring example .",
