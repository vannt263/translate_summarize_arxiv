    "in the heavy quark system , the heavy quark mass @xmath2 provides a natural normalization scale @xmath3 , which makes the perturbative qcd approach possible even for calculating some bound state properties of the heavy quarks .",
    "this implies that the heavy quark system is an excellent probe to learn about the qcd dynamics at finite density and/or temperature . here",
    ", we will highlight some calculations which explicitly demonstrate the relations between the changes of the properties of the heavy quark system and the qcd dynamics at finite density .",
    "let us first start with the @xmath0 meson mass at finite density .",
    "the interaction between the @xmath0 and a hadron @xmath4 can be perturbatively generated by multiple gluon exchanges .",
    "this implies that the mass shift of the @xmath0 in nuclear medium can be estimated if the gluon distribution is known in nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the heavy quark mass limit @xmath5 , the mass shift can be calculated exactly to leading order in qcd @xcite and is given as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a calculable constant and the matrix element is taken with respect to the nuclear matter . to the leading order in density , the matrix element is known from the trace anomaly relation and the gluon distribution function of the nucleon @xcite . for a more realistic charm quark mass , there are some model dependence on how to treat the bound state part .",
    "so far , there are potential model approaches @xcite and qcd sum rule approaches @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "similar relation to eq .",
    "( [ jpsimass ] ) holds with slightly different expressions for @xmath7 , such that the mass shift at nuclear matter density ranges from @xmath8 to @xmath9 mev .",
    "the mass shift is small at nuclear matter density and one doubts whether such a small mass shift can be observed .",
    "however , one can turn the argument around and claim that if any mass shift for @xmath0 is observed , it will tell us about the changes of gluon field configuration at finite density through eq .",
    "( [ jpsimass ] ) .      in the @xmath1 meson , the heavy quark acts as a source for the light quark , which surrounds the heavy quark and probes the qcd vacuum .",
    "this is the basic picture of the constituent quark in the heavy - light meson system within the formulation based on the heavy quark symmetry @xcite .",
    "therefore , if the vacuum properties are changed at finite temperature or density , the light quark should be sensitively affected and be reflected in the changes of the @xmath1 meson properties in matter . for the @xmath1 meson ,",
    "there does not exist a formal limit where one can calculate the mass change in matter . nevertheless , model calculations suggest @xcite that it is dominantly related to the change in the chiral condensate .",
    "in fact , in both the quark - meson coupling model @xcite and in the qcd sum rule approach @xcite , the average mass shift of the @xmath10 mesons at normal nuclear matter density were found to be around @xmath11 mev .",
    "the @xmath1 meson mass shift has several importance in the @xmath0 suppression phenomena in relativistic heavy ion collisions ( rhic ) .",
    "first , it leads to subthreshold production and the change of the @xmath12 threshold for the @xmath0 system in matter @xcite .",
    "second , a change of the averaged @xmath13 mass might lead to level crossings of the @xmath14 threshold with the @xmath15 and @xmath16 mass @xcite , which leads to a step - wise @xmath0 suppression @xcite . unfortunately , for the @xmath1 meson mass shift , there are large model dependence and nontrivial splitting between the @xmath17 and @xmath18 mesons @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 meson mass and the @xmath12 threshold have important phenomenological consequences .",
    "unfortunately , only model - dependent calculation could be made . here",
    ", we will introduce an exact qcd equality , which can be used to link the @xmath12 threshold to @xmath0 suppression .",
    "the exact sum rules in qcd at finite temperature and/or density were first introduced to the correlation functions between light hadrons @xcite and the derivation goes as follows .",
    "let us consider the correlation function between two meson currents and its dispersion relation , @xmath19 here , we have assumed @xmath20 and @xmath21 means the difference between the medium and the vacuum expectation values .",
    "@xmath22 is a dirac gamma matrix that will be determined by what meson we want to study . at @xmath23 , the real part of eq .",
    "( [ correlation ] ) can be determined from the operator product expansion ( ope ) in qcd , @xmath24 here , @xmath25 @xmath26 is the anomalous dimension of the operator ( current ) .",
    "equation ( [ anomalous ] ) is an asymptotic expansion in @xmath27 and @xmath28 . for @xmath29 ,",
    "the leading term is proportional to @xmath28 and can be related to the first moment of the spectral density as @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a dimension 4 operator and @xmath32 its corresponding wilson coefficient .",
    "one can generalize this formula for the heavy ( charm ) vector current @xmath33 at rest and obtain the following constraint : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the traceless energy momentum tensor and @xmath36 is the gluon condensate , which is related to the trace of the energy momentum tensor .",
    "lattice gauge theory provides the temperature dependence of the operators both below and above the phase transition temperature . from this",
    ", one can investigate what kind of changes in the spectral density , which in the vacuum has a generic form given in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfig3 ] , is consistent with the constraint equation .",
    "charmonium spectral density.,height=151 ]    now let us look at the changes at finite density . using the linear density approximation @xmath37 , one has @xmath38 where @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "in comparison with this , when neglecting the contribution from the @xmath15 , the spectral density in fig .  [",
    "fig : sfig3 ] can be parameterized as @xmath41 where @xmath42 gev@xmath43 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath44 now , since the mass shift @xmath45 is very small , the change in the first term is coming from the change in @xmath46 , which is related to the change of the coupling of the @xmath0 to the electromagnetic current .",
    "this is precisely related to the amount of @xmath0 suppression in matter . at linear density approximation , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( 6 ) , the expected change in the ope is of @xmath47 gev@xmath48 in the nuclear matter and can be neglected compared to a fractional change in the phenomenological side of eq .",
    "( [ phen ] ) .",
    "therefore , in this case , the suppression in @xmath46 is related to the decrease of @xmath49 . in an order of magnitude estimate",
    ", we arrive at @xmath50 where @xmath51 quantifies the amount of @xmath0 suppression seen through the dilepton signal . assuming that @xmath52 , eq .",
    "( [ approx ] ) implies that 10% suppression is related to 28 mev mass decrease of the @xmath1 meson in nuclear matter .    the relation in eq .",
    "( [ leading ] ) can be used in the other ways .",
    "namely , from the measurement of the changes in the mass of the @xmath1 mesons and the suppression of the @xmath0 peak , one is able to learn about the changes in the energy momentum tensor and gluon condensate at finite temperature or density , where the measurement would be made .",
    "@xmath0 suppression @xcite seems to be one of the most promising signal for qgp formation in rhic .",
    "indeed the recent data at cern @xcite show an anomalous suppression of @xmath0 formation , which seems to be a consequence of qgp formation @xcite .",
    "however , before coming to a concrete conclusion , one has to estimate the amount of @xmath0 suppression due to other non - qgp mechanism , one of which is the hadronic final state interactions .",
    "indeed , there are model calculations that show large suppression by hadronic final state interactions @xcite .",
    "the typical values for @xmath53 dissociation cross sections one uses for these calculations are @xmath54 mb and @xmath55 mb .",
    "however , there is no direct experimental data from which we can determine or confirm these cross sections .",
    "in fact , the existing model calculations vary greatly in their energy dependence and magnitude near the threshold . in fig .  [",
    "fig : com ] , we show the latest typical results of model calculations based on perturbative qcd @xcite , the meson exchange model @xcite and the quark exchange model @xcite . to understand the discrepancies and to obtain a consistent result ,",
    "it is crucial to probe each model calculations further so as to spell out the limitations and range of validity of each model calculations . here",
    ", we will have a closer look at the perturbative qcd result .",
    "more than two decades ago , peskin @xcite and bhanot and peskin @xcite showed that one could apply perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) to calculate the interactions between the bound state of heavy quarks and the light hadrons .",
    "such calculation was feasible because in the large quark mass limit one could consistently obtain the leading order ope of the correlation function between two heavy meson currents in the light hadron state .",
    "the justification of such calculation stems from the fact that there exist two relevant scales in the bound state @xcite in the large quark mass limit , namely the binding energy , which becomes coulomb - like and scales as @xmath56 , and the typical momentum scale of the bound state , which scales like @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the heavy quark mass and @xmath59 the quark - gluon coupling constant .",
    "hence , taking the separation scale of the ope to be the binding energy , it is consistent to take into account the bound state property , which is generated by the typical momentum scale of the bound state , into the process - dependent wilson coefficient .",
    "the result obtained by peskin and bhanot was derived within the ope @xcite .",
    "recently , we have derived anew the leading order pqcd result using the qcd factorization theorem @xcite .",
    "the equivalence between the ope and the factorization approach is well established in the deep inelastic scattering and drell - yan processes @xcite .",
    "our work shows that the equivalence between the two approaches are also true for bound state scattering to leading order in qcd .",
    "similar approach has been used by one of us ( shl ) to estimate the dissociation cross section of the @xmath0 at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the factorization formula also provides a manageable starting point to calculate higher twist gluonic effects @xcite , which should be nontrivial for the @xmath0-hadron scattering . here",
    ", we will sketch the derivation .",
    "we refer to a bound state of heavy quark and its own antiquark as @xmath60 . according to the factorization formula ,",
    "the total scattering cross section of @xmath60 with a hadron @xmath4 can be written as @xcite @xmath61 with @xmath62 , where @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) is the momentum of the hadron ( @xmath60 ) and @xmath65 is the @xmath60 mass . here",
    ", @xmath66 is the perturbative @xmath60-gluon scattering cross section and @xmath67 is the leading twist gluon distribution function within the hadron .",
    "the separation scale is taken to be the binding energy of the bound state .",
    "hence , the bound state properties have to be taken into account in @xmath66 .",
    "this can be accomplished by introducing the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) amplitude @xmath68 , which satisfies @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 with the number of color @xmath71 .",
    "the trivial color indices have been suppressed and @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) is the four - momentum of the heavy quark ( anti - quark ) .",
    "we write @xmath74 and @xmath75 and work in the @xmath60 rest frame and introduce the binding energy @xmath76 , such that @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "then , in the non - relativistic limit , the bs amplitude reduces to the following form : @xmath79 and the corresponding bs equation becomes the non - relativistic schrdinger equation for the coulombic bound state , so that @xmath80 is the normalized wave function for the bound state .",
    "scattering processes of @xmath60 and gluon.,height=132 ]    with the bs amplitude defined as eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs ] ) , we now obtain the @xmath60-gluon scattering amplitude with the processes depicted in fig .",
    "[ figreac ] .",
    "the scattering matrix elements can be obtained by substituting the bs amplitude for the vertex . to obtain the leading order result",
    ", we should pay attention to the counting scheme .",
    "first the binding energy @xmath81 ^ 2 $ ] is @xmath82 .",
    "combined with the energy conservation @xmath83 in the non - relativistic limit , this implies @xmath84 and @xmath85 . within this counting scheme",
    ", the final answer reads @xmath86    the scattering cross section @xmath66 can now be obtained from    @xmath87    with the amplitude ( [ eq : amp ] ) we obtain @xmath88 substituting eq .",
    "( [ phase ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : fact ] ) and using the known gluon distribution function in the pion , we obtain the dashed line in fig .  [",
    "fig : com ] .     scattering cross sections @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the solid lines are obtained in the non - relativistic limit and the dashed lines are with the relativistic correction.,height=170 ]      the counting of this formalism implies that for the charmonium system @xmath91 and the separation scale @xmath92 gev .",
    "hence , both the @xmath93 and higher twist effects should be important .",
    "however , calculating higher @xmath93 corrections in this formalism is intricately related to the relativistic corrections including @xmath94 corrections , which is a formidable future task .    here",
    ", we will only look at the simple but important relativistic correction coming from the relativistic calculation of the phase space integral in eq .",
    "( [ phase ] ) .",
    "the difference after a full calculation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : elem ] for @xmath66 , which shows larger suppression of the cross sections at higher energy .",
    "however , we find that this relativistic correction has almost no effect on the cross section @xmath95",
    ". this follows because @xmath66 is highly peaked at small energy region and the gluon distribution function increases towards small @xmath96 . through eq .",
    "( [ eq : fact ] ) , this implies that @xmath95 , at all energies , are dominated by the low energy behavior of @xmath66 , which is reliably calculated in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "this implies that the full relativistic corrections to the scattering amplitude @xmath66 would have little effects on @xmath95 .",
    "the remaining important and interesting correction is the higher twist - effect , which contributes as @xmath97 in our formalism . since @xmath98 is related to some hadronic scale of the hadron @xmath4 , it should be of the order @xmath99 itself , hence should be non - negligible @xcite .",
    "it is also important to extend this calculation to investigate the absortion cross section for the @xmath16 states .",
    "this will influence the amount of @xmath0 production coming from the decay of the @xmath16 s in a p - a or a - a reaction @xcite .",
    "as we have discussed , observation of the changes in the properties of the heavy quark system will provide us useful information about the qcd dynamics both in the vacuum and in the medium .",
    "important experimental observation would be mass shifts of the charmonium and open - charm system in nuclear medium . also important",
    "would be the quantitative observation of the suppression of the @xmath0 and @xmath15 signals in the medium through the dileptons .",
    "@xmath100-@xmath98 experiments to probe the @xmath0 in nuclear matter would also provide useful informations on the @xmath0-nucleon cross section at low energy .",
    "this is precisely where there is huge discrepancy between existing theoretical predictions",
    ". experimental investigation will provide useful information on the higher twist effects in the pqcd result for the @xmath0-nucleon cross section . here",
    ", the higher twist effect comes solely from gluon operators and hence this in turn would be a unique place to learn about the higher twist gluon effect of the nucleon and nuclear matter .",
