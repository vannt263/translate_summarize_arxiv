    "fluctuations play an important role in many areas of physics .",
    "the classic example is brownian motion @xcite , for example of a colloidal particle in a suspension .",
    "the effect of collisions of the small particles , that constitute the suspension , with the colloid is modelled by stochastic forces .",
    "the strength of these forces is inferred from the famous fluctuation - dissipation theorem , which states that their variance is proportional to damping due to viscosity , and to temperature , and that their average is zero .",
    "if the suspension is driven out of equilibrium , the average force on the colloid will no longer be zero . because of the non - equilibrium situation , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem in principle no longer holds , and the fluctuations can not be determined from it anymore .",
    "another explicit example of fluctuations in a driven system that do not obey the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is shot noise in the current in mesoscopic conductors , where the fluctuations are determined by the applied voltage instead of temperature .",
    "it is ultimately caused by the fact that the electric current is carried by discrete charge quanta , the electrons.@xcite    the non - equilibrium system on which we focus in this paper is a current - driven domain wall @xcite in a ferromagnetic conductor . here",
    "the domain wall and the electrons play the role of the colloid and the suspension from the above example .",
    "there are two distinct processes that lead to current - induced domain - wall motion : spin transfer @xcite and momentum transfer.@xcite physically , momentum transfer corresponds to the force exerted on the domain wall by electrons that are reflected by the domain wall or transmitted with different momentum .",
    "spin transfer corresponds to electrons whose spin follows the magnetization of the domain wall adiabatically , thereby exerting a torque on the domain wall .",
    "most experiments @xcite are in the adiabatic regime , where the electron spin follows the direction of magnetization adiabatically and where the spin - transfer torque is the dominant effect .",
    "the effect of spin relaxation on spin transfer in the adiabatic limit , leading to a dissipative spin - transfer torque , was discussed theoretically @xcite and experimentally.@xcite the experiments by feigenson _",
    "@xcite with srruo@xmath0 films , on the other hand , are believed to be in the non - adiabatic limit where domain walls are narrow compared to the fermi wave length and momentum transfer is dominant . in this paper , we will mostly consider narrow domain walls in nanocontacts.@xcite    apart from the forces and torques on the magnetization texture due to nonzero average current , there are also current - induced fluctuations on the magnetization @xcite that ultimately have their origin in shot noise in the spin and charge current .",
    "@xcite studied the effects of spin - current shot noise in single - domain ferromagnets , and found that for large voltage and low temperature the fluctuations are determined by the voltage and not by the temperature .",
