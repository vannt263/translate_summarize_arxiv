    "the origins of supermassive black holes in galaxy nuclei are not well understood .",
    "while core - collapse supernovae provide a natural means of producing stellar - mass black holes , dissipation on a much larger scale is required to build up black holes with masses of @xmath0 m@xmath1 as inferred in luminous quasars and in the centers of massive quiescent galaxies .",
    "the gas accretion that powers active galactic nuclei is a means of growing black hole mass , but the onset of qso activity at redshifts @xmath2 and the correspondingly short timescale for black hole growth may implicate another growth mechanism that is rapid and radiatively inefficient .",
    "these considerations have prompted interest in mechanisms for producing `` seed '' black holes of intermediate mass ( @xmath3 m@xmath1 ) that later emerge as the drivers of luminous agns ( see shapiro 2004 and van der marel 2004 for reviews ) .",
    "dense star clusters provide one possible vehicle for generating intermediate mass black holes .",
    "interest in star clusters as possible precursers for massive black holes has grown as a result of surveys demonstrating that clusters are commonly found in the centers of disk galaxies @xcite and also ellipticals @xcite .",
    "a physical connection between nuclear star clusters and supermassive black holes is suggested by the fact that the masses of the two types of objects independently scale with the luminosity or mass of the host galaxy or bulge , with a similar factor of proportionality @xcite .",
    "a nuclear star cluster and intermediate - mass black hole are known to coexist in at least one object , ngc  4395 , a late - type ( sd ) galaxy which hosts a central cluster coincident with a low - luminosity seyfert 1 nucleus powered by accretion onto a black hole with mass of @xmath4 m@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "formation of such a collapsed object is clearly not inevitable in such environments ; m33 , a galaxy of similar morphology , hosts a nuclear star cluster , but no evidence of a significant black hole ( @xmath5 m@xmath1 , gebhardt et al .",
    "2001 ; @xmath6 m@xmath1 , merritt et al .",
    "additional investigation is needed if we are to understand whether a real connection exists between nuclear star clusters and the formation of intermediate - mass black holes .",
    "late - type galaxies such as ngc  4395 and m33 hold additional special interest as _ bulgeless _ systems that nonetheless harbor central mass concentrations , and in the case of ngc  4395 , a black hole .",
    "evidence for the coexistence of nuclear clusters with black holes as traced by agns in galaxies in general has recently been summarized by @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report on observations that bear on this matter for the nuclear star cluster in another bulgeless galaxy , ngc  1042 ( morphological type sab(rs)cd , de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "the presence of a central cluster in this galaxy was first revealed in the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "imaging survey described by @xcite ; an @xmath7-band image along with a surface brightness profile of the inner galaxy is given in that reference .",
    "spectroscopic measurements of the cluster stellar population and mass have been presented by walcher et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "here we focus on emission - line properties of the galaxy nucleus , and evidence they provide for accretion power indicative of a central black hole .",
    "for our analysis we make use of several observations of the ngc 1042 nucleus .",
    "the spectrum of this source was obtained with the twin spectrograph at the calar alto 3.5 m telescope on 2005 august 04 .",
    "two grating settings were used to cover a total bandpass of 3440  7570   with a 1  slit , yielding a spectral resolution of @xmath8 .",
    "the seeing during the observations was @xmath908 and the slit was oriented at pa=25@xmath10 which was close to the parallactic angle .",
    "the spectra were calibrated using standard methods .",
    "conditions at the time were nonphotometric , and we determined the scalefactor necessary to place our spectra on an absolute photometric scale through comparison with a spectrum of ngc  1042 obtained by the _",
    "sloan digital sky survey _",
    "( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for this purpose",
    "we used a 3-wide extraction from the twin spectrum , which is similar in dimension to the 3-diameter sdss fiber aperture .",
    "the two spectra are very similar in continuum and emission - line properties .",
    "the continuum and emission - line fluxes are spatially strongly peaked ; we consequently did not attempt to correct for the different aperture areas , but note that the resulting flux scale could be uncertain by as much as a factor of 2 .",
    "( we note that this uncertainty does not affect our subsequent conclusions that are based on line ratios . )    the twin spectrum of the ngc  1042 nucleus as measured through a 1@xmath11 1synthetic aperture is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the spectrum shows emission lines superposed on a stellar continuum , with signal - to - noise ratio decreasing at the blue end .",
    "the aperture is substantially larger than the central star cluster , which has an effective radius of @xmath1202 @xcite , and thus the spectrum in figure 1 contains significant circumnuclear starlight ( 81% of the total light in the i bandpass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and nebular emission .",
    "we also obtained high resolution spectra for the ngc  1042 nucleus using uves at the very large telescope , for purposes of resolving absorption features and enabling accurate estimation of the stellar velocity dispersion and population constraints .",
    "the uves observations were obtained with a 1-wide slit , and span two wavelength intervals , 3570  4830   and 6120  7980  , with resolution of @xmath13 .",
    "the seeing for these observations was @xmath908 , and we used an extraction width of 1to measure the spectrum of the nucleus .",
    "the instrument slit was maintained at the parallactic angle throughout , thereby sweeping through position angles @xmath14 .",
    "portions of the resulting spectra are shown as insets in figure 1 .",
    "further details and analysis of the stellar continuum as measured in the uves data are presented by walcher et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the continuum is dominated by an old stellar population .",
    "within the optical bandpass , nebular emission may signal the presence of an active galactic nucleus through emission - line strengths , ratios , and/or profiles . with the data described in  2 we are able to investigate each of these aspects of the ngc  1042 nucleus .    on first inspection ,",
    "the emission - line ratios for this source are ambiguous in their interpretation .",
    "we measured the flux of prominent emission features in the twin spectrum ; in so doing we did not attempt to subtract the starlight but corrected the balmer emission - line fluxes using the equivalent widths ( ews ) of underlying absorption as determined from the population fit to the high - resolution uves spectra @xcite .",
    "the resulting line fluxes are listed in table 1 , and line ratios commonly used for nebular classification are plotted in figure 2 . in each case the ratios for the nucleus fall close to the agn / starburst boundary . also shown in table 1 and figure 2 are measurements obtained through adjacent , off - nucleus apertures , spanning @xmath15on both sides of the nucleus .",
    "the off - nucleus spectrum displays emission consistent with high - metallicity regions photoionized by hot stars .",
    "the nuclear h@xmath16/h@xmath17 ratio is consistent with the case b prediction ( @xmath18 ) and hence negligible reddening within the measurement uncertainties .",

    "the @xcite models used by walcher et al .",
    "provide quantitative predictions for the ionizing luminosity emitted by the stars producing the observed blue spectra .",
    "for the uves spectra no absolute flux calibration exists , hence the ionizing photon flux derived from the blue setting and the h@xmath16 flux from the red setting are not directly comparable",
    ". however , consistent predictions for the h@xmath16 emission line and the adjacent continuum can be obtained from the fits to the blue spectra , so that the predicted h@xmath16 emission equivalent width ( ew ) can be directly compared with the observed value .",
    "the predicted ew(h@xmath16 ) assuming complete absorption of the ionizing photons and case b recombination is 16.2  , which is in excellent agreement with the measured value of @xmath51  .",
    "( the latter value includes a correction for underlying stellar absorption with ew = @xmath52 . )",
    "an accretion source is thus not required to explain the nebular recombination flux if the stellar ionizing radiation is absorbed efficiently , and if this radiation truly arises from stars ; in composite optical spectra it can , however , be very difficult to distinguish hot stellar components from power - law emission powered by accretion .",
    "we thus can not exclude the possibility that the blue continuum component identified in the stellar populations fitting is in fact a weak agn continuum that extends beyond 13.6 ev , thereby contributing to the nebular ionization .",
    "the uves spectra provide detailed information on emission line profiles and the results are surprising .",
    "the upper inset in figure 1 shows the h@xmath16 @xmath196563 , [ ] @xmath536548 , 6583 lines , which are the strongest transitions in the red uves spectrum .",
    "the [ ] lines have full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) velocities of @xmath54 km s@xmath55 , which is consistent with the stellar velocity dispersion in the same aperture of @xmath56 km s@xmath55 @xcite for a gaussian distribution ( fwhm = 2.35@xmath57 ) .",
    "the lines clearly deviate from gaussian profiles in that they show prominent wings , most visible in [ ] @xmath196583 , extending to approximately @xmath58 km s@xmath55 from line center . while these large gas velocities are suggestive of agn activity , figure 1 presents a conundrum in that the h@xmath16 line is obviously _ narrower _ than the [ ] lines , in contrast with seyferts and liners where the lines have comparable widths , or broader widths for the balmer lines .",
    "this difference can be seen more clearly in figure 3 , which shows an overlay of the two profiles .",
    "the h@xmath16 line has fwhm @xmath59 km s@xmath55 which is actually less than would be predicted from the stellar @xmath57 in the gaussian case",
    ". underlying stellar absorption does not significantly distort the h@xmath16 profile ; figure 3 also shows the result of subtracting the continuum obtained from the stellar population fit described by @xcite , and the emission profile is substantially unaltered .",
    "insight into the unusual line profiles can be gained by examining the spatial variation of emission properties along the uves slit .",
    "the emission - line flux as a function of position is plotted in figure 4 , which shows measurements obtained from 1-wide extractions stepped along the slit .",
    "the figure shows that the h@xmath16 peak flux is offset by @xmath9 05 ( i.e. @xmath60 pc ) from the location of the peak flux in the forbidden lines and in the stellar continuum .",
    "this offset is likewise evident in a published sauron h@xmath17 map @xcite .",
    "notably , the location of maximum forbidden line flux is also the location of maximum velocity width for _ all _ of the lines , including h@xmath16 ( figure 5 ) ; at the same site , the [ ] /h@xmath16 , [ ] /h@xmath16 , and [ ] /h@xmath16 ratios achieve maxima .",
    "figure 4 shows that the [ ] @xmath196716/ [ ] @xmath196731 flux ratio also exhibits spatial variations , with a minimum value indicative of a maximum plasma density at the site of peak forbidden - line emission .",
    "it is additionally noteworthy that emission in [ ] , which tends to trace nonstellar ionization processes , is the most highly concentrated , consistent with a compact source centered at the location of peak line and continuum flux .",
    "inspection of the rotation curve measured from the emission lines ( figure 6 ) indicates that the position of peak continuum and forbidden - line flux is consistent with the kinematic center for this system , although an offset of @xmath61 km s@xmath55 is seen between h@xmath16 and [ ] in the central aperture .",
    "the spatially resolved uves results can be understood collectively if an accretion source is located at the site of maximum line width , forbidden - line flux , and continuum emission ",
    "i.e. , coincident with the nuclear star cluster , as well as the kinematic center  and an offset region is responsible for the peak h@xmath16 flux .",
    "the line profiles seen in the central extraction shown in figure 1 are thus naturally explained as the blended emission from a weak agn and an region , with the latter component dominating the h@xmath16 line .",
    "the composite nature of the nucleus additionally provides an explanation for why line ratios plotted in figure 2 fall near the agn / starburst demarcation .",
    "we obtained an approximate decomposition of the two contributions by assuming that the [ ] @xmath196583 profile was dominated by the accretion source .",
    "we first subtracted the underlying stellar continuum from the h@xmath16 + [ ] wavelength region for the nucleus using the multi - age composite stellar fit described by @xcite . we then scaled the [ ] profile to match the h@xmath16 wings , and subtracted the scaled profile to determine approximately what fraction of h@xmath16 remains that can be attributed to the region , i.e. , 61% .",
    "we can use this fraction to correct the emission ratios shown in figure 2 , and for this purpose use the emission spectrum from the off - nucleus aperture as a template for the component .",
    "( this estimate assumes that h@xmath16 and h@xmath17 have the same relative proportions of agn and region emission in the central aperture . )",
    "the resulting shifts in position for the ratios for the central region are shown in figure 2 ; in each case the central source moves more definitively into the locus of agns .",
    "while the detailed decomposition described here is only approximate and can not be considered unique , it is clear that removal of h@xmath16 and other emission associated with the source adjacent to the nucleus ( figure 4 ) would offset the line ratios to values in stronger accord with a central accretion source .",
    "similar examples of mixed agn and emission revealed through line profile differences are described by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite . in ngc  1042 the underlying agn is a type 2 object ( no detected broad h@xmath16 ) with emission - line ratios consistent with classification as a liner .",
    "high energy emission would be expected from the agn , but will require deep observations in order to be detectable .",
    "an archival _ rosat _ hri image exists for ngc  1042 , with an exposure of 22 ksec in 1995 july .",
    "no source is evident at the position of the nucleus , and taking into consideration the poisson nature of a possible source and local background yields a 90%-confidence upper limit of 7.4 counts for the agn . assuming a distance to ngc  1042 of 18.2 mpc , absorption by the galactic column density of @xmath62 @xmath63 @xcite , and an intrinsic power - law source with photon index @xmath64 , this limit translates into @xmath65 erg s@xmath55 . extrapolating the same assumed continuum to harder energies",
    "would imply @xmath66 erg s@xmath55 .",
    "it is useful to combine the latter value with the agn h@xmath16 luminosity , for comparison with other systems .",
    "after removing the estimated contamination from the adjacent region ( see  3 ) and correcting for galactic extinction of @xmath67 mag @xcite , the h@xmath16 luminosity for the ngc  1042 nucleus is @xmath68 erg s@xmath55 .",
    "the upper limit to the x - ray luminosity is easily consistent with measurements for other weak agns with comparable @xmath69 @xcite . the lack of a detection with _",
    "rosat _ is thus consistent with the low luminosity of the agn indicated by its optical emission .",
    "from analysis of the ngc 1042 optical spectra we conclude that this source presents strong evidence for an accreting black hole coincident with a compact nuclear star cluster .",
    "we can draw several other inferences from this source which are of interest for comparison with other galaxies .    while we have no means of measuring the black hole mass , we can place a lower limit on its value if the source s luminosity is less than the eddington luminosity .",
    "we can obtain an order - of - magnitude estimate of the radiative output of the agn using measurements of the h@xmath16 line .",
    "if this low luminosity source has a spectral energy distribution similar to typical liners , then we expect the bolometric luminosity to be @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath16 measurement thus implies @xmath71 erg s@xmath55 for ngc 1042 , and hence @xmath72 m@xmath1 if the agn accretes at a sub - eddington rate .",
    "an upper bound on @xmath73 can also be obtained from measurements of the nuclear star cluster based on estimates of the mass - to - light ratio @xmath74 for this source .",
    "if @xmath73 is significant in comparison with the stellar mass in the central cluster , @xmath74 based on dynamical estimates of total mass will be increased by a corresponding amount .",
    "@xcite obtained a dynamical estimate of @xmath74 for the nucleus of ngc  1042 , and @xcite reported an independent estimate of @xmath74 using multi - component stellar population fits to the optical spectra .",
    "the latter method will not include the contribution from any dark mass , but walcher et al .",
    "find that @xmath74 obtained from the stellar population analysis is formally somewhat _ larger _ than the dynamical estimate .",
    "we can conclude from this that @xmath73 must be modest in comparison with the cluster stellar mass , @xmath75 m@xmath1 @xcite , and can thus adopt this value as an upper limit for the black hole .",
    "we can estimate black hole mass from the stellar @xmath57 using the @xmath76 relation @xcite , although its applicability in this case is uncertain .",
    "the @xmath76 relation is based on measurements of @xmath57 for host galaxy bulges , while in ngc  1042 we only have a measure of @xmath57 for the central star cluster . in this context",
    "it is noteworthy that measurements of the globular cluster g1 in m31 are consistent with extrapolation of the relation to the scale of massive globular star clusters @xcite . for ngc  1042",
    "the @xmath76 relation as derived by @xcite would predict @xmath77 m@xmath1 . this value is consistent with the bounds obtained above , and",
    "would imply a rather low value of the eddington ratio @xmath78 , in accord with the liner classification for the observed agn @xcite .",
    "based on these arguments , we can state that an intermediate - mass black hole with @xmath79 m@xmath80 m@xmath1 resides in ngc  1042 s nucleus , coincident with the central star cluster .",
    "this discovery provides added incentive to consider star clusters as an essential element in spawning collapsed objects that grow into the central engines of luminous agns .",
    "ngc  1042 thus may present some of the attributes today of early galaxies that have evolved to host supermassive black holes .",
    "regardless of the detailed evolutionary pathway , the formation of massive compact star clusters and black holes requires substantial dissipation and collapse of matter to the central parsecs of a galaxy .",
    "ngc  1042 , along with ngc  4395 , provide demonstrations that the two types of massive central objects can readily coexist , a point that should be considered when linking these structures in a common framework ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the relationship between @xmath73 and other galaxy attributes in objects like ngc  1042 remains ill - determined .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the central black hole in such galaxies is linked to the nuclear cluster in some manner analogous to the black hole - bulge correlations found in earlier hubble types .",
    "however , the situation remains confused in that the other known examples , ngc  4395 and m33 (  1 ) , fall off the extrapolated @xmath76 relation with @xmath73 values that are too high and too low , respectively , for the @xmath57 as measured in the central region for ngc  4395 obtained from reverberation mapping @xcite is larger than expected from the @xmath76 relation , but @xmath73 estimates obtained by other means , as described by @xcite , result in better agreement . ] .",
    "several authors have suggested that @xmath73 is linked most fundamentally to galaxy halo mass , rather than bulge mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this idea remains controversial @xcite .",
    "bulgeless galaxies like ngc  1042 offer an interesting class of objects for probing these ideas ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one complication is the finding by @xcite that apparently bulgeless galaxies often have modest central light excesses above a simple extrapolation of an exponential disk . in this regard",
    "it is worth noting that ngc  1042 has one of the largest such excesses among the galaxies analyzed by bker et al .",
    "it is tempting to regard this finding as further evidence linking central black holes and bulge - like structures , but a more systematic survey is needed to draw definite conclusions .",
    "in this study we have presented evidence from optical spectroscopy that a low - excitation agn resides in the nucleus of the late - type galaxy ngc  1042 .",
    "existing constraints suggest that the accretion activity is powered by an intermediate - mass black hole . this result is noteworthy in that a compact star cluster",
    "also resides in the nucleus ; consequently this source may implicate an important role for star clusters in generating `` seed '' black holes in galaxy centers .",
    "ngc  1042 is also remarkable in hosting a central black hole while lacking a stellar bulge .",
    "understanding the implications for black hole formation in relation to galaxy evolution will require study of statistical samples of similar galaxies , where simultaneous measurements of bulge , central cluster , and black hole properties are possible .",
