    "non - minimal coupling of the dilaton and the metric is a generic feature of any string theory(see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while usual compactifications do not generate any potential , in the low energy limit , for the dilaton or other massless scalars coming from the string theory , it is generally believed that a potential is generated for them when one considers flux compactifications@xcite .",
    "generation of potential for scalar fields in the flux compactification , makes them an arena for study of physics of the early universe .",
    "however , if one looks at models of inflation in these compactifications , a generic problem crops up in the slow roll inflation .",
    "one of the slow roll parameters , @xmath2 , turns out to be sensitive to the size of compactified space and one finds that the slow roll condition , i.e. , @xmath3 is harder to achieve@xcite .",
    "smallness of the slow roll parameters @xmath4 and @xmath2 ensures that the scale factor @xmath5 in the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background grows exponentially in time or alternatively the hubble parameter @xmath6 is constant during the inflationary epoch @xcite .",
    "the slow roll conditions come from the einstein equations , where we demand that the energy - momentum tensor on the right hand side ( rhs ) of the equation is proportional to a constant times the frw metric@xcite .",
    "since rhs contains the scalar field energy - momentum tensor this condition reflects upon the nature of the potential .",
    "however , if we have a non - minimally coupled scalar field with a potential such that it does not gravitate , i.e. , its energy - momentum tensor vanishes identically then smallness of slow roll parameters @xmath4 and @xmath2 becomes irrelevant .",
    "this is because throughout the rolling of the non - gravitating scalar field there is no contribution of it on the rhs of the einstein equations .",
    "the shape of the potential and rolling of the scalar field becomes relevant only when , by some other mechanism , it starts gravitating .",
    "if we achieve sufficient amount of inflation before the scalar field starts gravitating then subsequent time dependence of the scalar field has no bearing on the model of inflation . as we will see below , for a specific kind of non - minimal coupling",
    ", one gets a fixed potential for the scalar field so that it does not gravitate .",
    "it is not obvious if such a non - minimal coupling and/or the potential can be obtained from a generic flux compactification .",
    "nevertheless inflation in the theory with a non - gravitating scalar field is a novel way of by - passing the ` @xmath2-problem'@xcite in the models of inflation in the flux compactifications@xcite .",
    "if we are looking for a non - gravitating scalar field background , it could generically depend on the spatial coordinates as well .",
    "this question was addressed by@xcite in the minkowski spacetime and in the next section we will obtain similar results for frw and anti - de sitter backgrounds . as in @xcite , we find that the classical non - gravitating solution allows space dependent scalar field profile in all these cases , including the minkowski spacetime .",
    "however , in every case , this solution is singular .",
    "that is , the scalar field profile diverges at some point in space / spacetime .",
    "this singularity begs for a careful evaluation of the energy - momentum tensor in its neighbourhood .",
    "we analyze the energy - momentum tensor by regularizing the singular scalar field profile and find that there is a subtle contribution to the energy - momentum tensor from the singularity .",
    "this contribution is proportional to the dirac @xmath7-function but with an infinite multiplicative coefficient . due to this contribution",
    ", the space dependent scalar field profile actually gravitates . while this rules out non - constant solution in the minkowski spacetime , purely time dependent solution",
    "is allowed class of non - gravitating solutions in the frw background .",
    "similarly , purely radial dependent solution can be non - gravitating in the ads background .",
    "since purely time dependent solution in the frw background can be non - gravitating , we build a hybrid inflation model by coupling the non - gravitating solution to another scalar field @xmath1 , which is gravitating .",
    "inflation is obtained by rolling of the non - gravitating scalar field and is exited by rolling of the gravitating scalar field , _ i.e. _ , @xmath1 .",
    "the rolling of @xmath1 is triggered by that of the non - gravitating field .",
    "interesting feature of this model is that the non - gravitating scalar field starts gravitating as soon as @xmath1 starts rolling .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : ngsfrw ] , we review the result for non - gravitating scalar field and its interaction potential functional in the minkowski background and obtain the same in frw and ads backgrounds . in section",
    "[ sec : regt ] , we perform the regularized energy - momentum tensor calculation in the vicinity of the singularity of the scalar field profile .",
    "we also mention the subtleties related to the issue of finding the backreacted metric in the presence of the non - vanishing stress tensor . in section  [ sec : him ] , we propose a novel model of hybrid inflation by considering another scalar field @xmath1 . finally , section  [ sec : dsc ] summarizes our results .",
    "in this section we will study a scalar field @xmath8 non - minimally coupled to gravity . we will first recall how the non - gravitating solution is obtained in the minkowski space@xcite .",

    "a similar solution on the other side of the singularity can then be matched with the first one along with the contribution from the singularity .",

    "we can now take the @xmath7-function contribution into account to match solutions on either side of the singularity .",
    "due to the time dependent coefficient of the @xmath7-function , we end up with inconsistent powers of the scale factor on the right and left hand side of the einstein equation .",
    "we therefore conclude that the separable ansatz does not give a solution to our coupled inhomogeneous pdes .",
    "we have tried out more general separable ansatze but all of them have suffered the same fate .",
    "since vanishing of the energy - momentum tensor also gives rise to coupled nonlinear , but homogeneous , partial differential equations , we can attempt to get another solution of these equations which are not singular .",
    "this does not seem to lead to any new solution .",
    "noticing the fact that the scalar field profile is proportional to @xmath117 , we can try a field redefinition , @xmath118 and attempt to seek a solution @xmath119 this ansatz gives us back the singular solution . instead of the additive ansatz",
    "if we take a multiplicative ansatz , i.e. , @xmath120 we end up with a contradiction .",
    "while one equation demands the scale factor to be a function of time only , other equation is satisfied only if the scale factor has spatial dependence .",
    "replacing @xmath121 in the product ansatz by any other time dependent function does not alter the result .",
    "in the previous section , we saw that space dependent scalar field profile fails to be non - gravitating . however , if we look at purely time dependent scalar field profile in the frw background , it does not lead to any subtle contribution to the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "we can therefore use the space independent scalar field profile to construct a model of inflation .    to do that we will couple another scalar field @xmath122 to the model studied above . for simplicity",
    "we consider minimal coupling between @xmath122 and gravity .",

    "for a fixed @xmath131 , it is easy to see from the potential ( [ eq : vcin ] ) , that we have two regimes corresponding to @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "as we discussed in the previous section , space dependent profile for @xmath0 is singular and it gives rise to a subtle contribution to the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the space dependent solution ( [ eq : phfrsm ] ) therefore is not a bona fide non - gravitating solution .",
    "purely time dependent configuration for @xmath0 , however , does not suffer from this problem and is a legitimate non - gravitating field configuration . for @xmath134 , the potential for the field @xmath1",
    "has a unique minimum at @xmath135 and in this case the field @xmath0 does not gravitate .",
    "the exponential growth of scale factor is then determined solely by the cosmological constant @xmath136 and the rate at which the field @xmath0 is rolling is irrelevant .",
    "in particular , the slow roll parameters @xmath4 and @xmath2 determined from the potential @xmath9 have no bearing on the nature of the inflation as @xmath8 is not gravitating in this domain .",

    "the first term is identical to the scalar field in the hybrid inflation models , which is responsible for exit from the inflationary regime .",
