    "one appealing possibility can be formulated as a relation between the lepton mixing matrix , @xmath4 , and the quark mixing matrix , @xmath5 , of the following form  @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a unitary matrix which may coincide with the ckm mixing matrix or , in general , has the same hierarchical structure as @xmath5 with expansion parameter @xmath8 .",
    "we use here the notation @xmath9 to underline the close connection to ( the same origin as ) the quark mixing matrix @xmath5 .",
    "the unitary matrix @xmath1 is related to additional structures in the lepton sector which are responsible for the smallness of neutrino masses , and it may be of special form originating from certain symmetries . to be in agreement with the data , @xmath1 should have vanishing ( or small ) 1 - 3 mixing and large ( or even maximal ) 2 - 3 mixing .",
    "the relation ( [ quark - lepton - mixing ] ) has been explored on pure phenomenological grounds in @xcite .",

    "also golden - ratio mixing  @xcite has been considered with @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "all these cases have maximal 2 - 3 mixing , zero 1 - 3 mixing but differ by the values of 1 - 2 mixing .",
    "the measured value of @xmath17 supports the relation ( [ quark - lepton - mixing ] ) . indeed , for @xmath13 and @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is arbitrary ) the lepton mixing according to ( [ quark - lepton - mixing ] ) becomes @xmath20 .",

    "the remaining difference can be due to non - maximal 2 - 3 mixing in @xmath1 .",
    "it can originate from some difference between @xmath9 and @xmath5 which , in turn , can be related to the difference of the masses of the charged leptons and down - type quarks .",
    "various data sets indicate that apart from the `` visible '' sector of theory , a `` hidden sector '' exists which is composed of singlets of the standard model ( or gut ) gauge symmetry group",
    ". the hidden sector can be responsible for the dark sector of the universe which includes particles of the dark matter , fields needed for inflation and particles involved in the generation of the lepton and baryon asymmetries of the universe .",

    "finally , the hidden sector could be responsible for the generation of small neutrino masses .",
    "the hidden sector may not follow a generation structure and the number of new fermions as well as bosons can be bigger or even much bigger than three . the hidden sector particles may have their own interactions including gauge ( dark photons ) and yukawa interactions .",
    "moreover , the hidden sector may have its own symmetries @xmath2 , but there can be also some common symmetries with the visible sector . the origin of these symmetries as well as the components of the hidden sector can be compactification of extra dimensions in string theory  @xcite .    in this paper we will update on the relation ( [ quark - lepton - mixing ] ) .",
    "we argue that it suggests the double seesaw mechanism , grand unification and the presence of a hidden sector of theory .",
    "we propose a framework in which the required form of the matrix @xmath1 originates from symmetries of the hidden sector , whereas @xmath5 is generated by another kind of new physics .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",

    "additional singlets which directly couple to the @xmath138 .",
    "additional singlets which do not directly couple to the @xmath138 but mix with the other fermionic singlets of the hidden sector .    in the first case ,",
    "the number of singlets @xmath89 directly coupled to the @xmath138 in the portal interaction @xmath118 is larger than three .",
    "thus , @xmath94 is not a square matrix and therefore not invertible .",
    "however , if @xmath93 is invertible , @xmath88 is given by the usual expression @xmath231 and the seesaw formulae change to    [ general - seesaw ] @xmath232    with the mass scales indicated in table  [ scales ] , the new term @xmath233 is expected to be of the order @xmath234 and therefore negligible compared to all other contributions to @xmath75 . if @xmath93 is singular and @xmath94 has rank three , the matrix @xmath235 can still be invertible , but the formulae  ( [ mreff])-([ls ] ) and  ( [ general - seesaw ] ) will not hold any more . notice that the case of more than three singlets coupled directly to the @xmath138 is disfavoured by the requirement of screening of the dirac mass matrix . indeed , in the basis where @xmath67 is diagonal , exact screening in the sense that the structure of @xmath159 is solely determined by @xmath93 requires @xmath236 _ i.e. _  a diagonal @xmath94",
    "however , if @xmath94 is a general matrix with hierarchy among its rows , partial screening is possible .    for case  2 , which is favoured by screening ,",
    "we need vanishing of the couplings of the additional singlets @xmath237 to the @xmath138 .",
    "this can be achieved for example by introduction of an additional @xmath238 symmetry under which @xmath138 and the three singlets @xmath123 change the sign whereas @xmath237 do not change . in order to allow couplings between @xmath123 and @xmath237 also new flavon fields charged under @xmath238",
    "should be introduced .",
    "the @xmath238-symmetry thus acts as a kind of connecting symmetry . among all hidden sector",
    "fields it selects three which can directly couple to the @xmath138 . in this case",
    "the neutrino mass matrix has the form @xmath239 and the double seesaw formula becomes @xmath240 while the linear seesaw formula remains unchanged .",
    "thus , in the double seesaw expression the former mass matrix @xmath241 ( @xmath134 in the notation here ) gets replaced by an effective mass matrix @xmath242 this looks like the first term in a seesaw expansion , but the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ modified - ds ] ) does not need the assumption of any hierarchy in the matrix @xmath243 the only condition is that @xmath136 is invertible .",
    "therefore , singlet fermions which do not couple directly to the @xmath138 will have an impact on the neutrino mass matrix @xmath159",
    ".    the seesaw - like formula  ( [ seesaw - like ] ) may offer more possibilities to obtain interesting structures in @xmath93 and therefore in @xmath159 , in particular when non - abelian symmetries of @xmath244 are assumed ( see section  [ ill2 ] ) .",
    "if the symmetry @xmath2 of @xmath244 is abelian , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath244 is restricted by texture zeros only , there could still be `` effective '' non - abelian structures in @xmath245 .",
    "for example , in case of a large hidden fermion sector , as could be motivated by string theory  @xcite , @xmath244 would have a large dimension of up to @xmath246 , and therefore the elements of @xmath245 would get many contributions . since @xmath244 is close to string / planck scale , the yukawa couplings could be universal ( nearly equal or with small spread ) . if also the flavon vevs determining @xmath244 are not completely random , some of the elements of @xmath245 could be approximately equal as is required by the 2 - 3-permutation symmetry .",
    "in this way specific structures in the @xmath247 effective mass matrix @xmath245 are possible without non - abelian symmetries in the hidden sector .",
    "up to now in our examples we discussed only the higgs ten - plet @xmath248 which has higgs - doublet vevs @xmath249 and @xmath250 . this was enough for the symmetry considerations regarding @xmath67 , but in order to have quark mixing we need @xmath251 , which can be achieved by introduction of scalar ten - plets @xmath252 with vevs @xmath253 and @xmath254 .",
    "another possibility is the introduction of additional scalars @xmath255 and @xmath256 giving @xmath251 via the effective operator @xmath257  @xcite . here",
    "we will only discuss the scenario with additional ten - plets .",
    "generation of ckm mixing requires breaking of the basis - fixing symmetry @xmath258 .",
    "in fact , @xmath125 is already broken spontaneously in the hidden sector by the flavon vevs which generate the matrix @xmath93 .",
    "this breaking leads to quark mixing via higher order operators @xmath259 here the singlet operator is built from the flavons of table  [ flavons ] .",
    "invariance under @xmath260 requires it to be of second order .",
    "note that it transforms non - trivially under @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "hence , the operator of eq .",
    "( [ basis - breaking ] ) gives corrections to the diagonal form of @xmath261 of the order @xmath262 , which are certainly too small to generate the experimentally observed @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , we should introduce additional sources of @xmath125 breaking .",
    "for instance , breaking of @xmath125 can be achieved by introduction of several ten - plets @xmath252 charged under @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "instead , we can introduce only one @xmath252 , being a singlet of @xmath125 , which is connected by a symmetry @xmath263 with additional flavons @xmath264 charged under @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "as connecting symmetry we can use @xmath265 where @xmath46 is a root of unity and @xmath266 is a positive integer .",
    "all elements of @xmath261 can then be generated by effective operators of the form @xmath267 the correct hierarchy of @xmath261 can be produced by appropriate values of the vevs and yukawa - couplings of the different @xmath268 as well as the powers @xmath266 .",
    "elaboration of this new physics is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "an important feature of this scenario is that @xmath269 is generated solely by new physics that determines the structure of @xmath261 and @xmath270 .",
    "thus , the smallness of the 1 - 3 and 2 - 3 quark mixing angles is not related to the strong mass hierarchy of the up - type quarks .",
    "however , the size of the cabibbo angle may still be a result of the down - type quark mass hierarchy  @xcite .    finally , to generate the correct mass hierarchy in @xmath270 , different from @xmath261",
    ", we have to introduce other representations for the higgs fields .",
    "for example , adding 45-plet higgs fields @xmath271 one can effectively generate @xmath272 via the dimension - five operator  @xcite @xmath273 the problem is that inequality @xmath274 in general implies that @xmath275 and thus spoils relation  ( [ quark - lepton - mixing ] ) .",
    "a possible solution is that the antisymmetric parts of @xmath261 and @xmath270 coming from the interaction  ( [ 45 ] ) are chosen in such a way that still @xmath276 , but @xmath277 and @xmath278  @xcite .",
    "the latest measurements of the lepton mixing parameters are in good agreement with the relation @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we have proposed a framework which allows to realize such a relation .",
    "the framework is based on the double seesaw mechanism of neutrino mass generation , grand unification and the existence of a hidden sector with certain symmetries .",
    "the framework provides another way to unification of the quark and lepton mixings .",
    "the lepton mixing matrix has two contributions .",
    "the first one comes from the `` ckm new physics , '' which is common for quarks and leptons and associated to interactions that generate the dirac mass matrices .",
    "the other one is the contribution from structures responsible for the smallness of neutrino masses .",
    "these structures originate from the hidden sector . in this framework",
    "the ckm physics can be disentangled to a large extent from the `` new neutrino physics . ''",
    "it allows to reconcile the strong mass hierarchy and small mixing of quarks with the mild hierarchy of light neutrinos and large lepton mixing .",
    "the key elements of the framework are the basis - fixing symmetry and mediator fields which communicate information from the hidden sector to the visible one .",
    "an appropriate basis - fixing symmetry is the abelian @xmath3 for which the symmetry basis coincides with the mass basis ( in the first approximation ) .",
    "the mediator fields have charges of the basis - fixing symmetry , as well as charges of other symmetries in the hidden and/or visible sector .",
    "the basis - fixing symmetry is consistent with abelian symmetries of the hidden sector which can lead to particular structures of @xmath73 , _",
    "e.g. _  a dominant 2 - 3-block .    to obtain @xmath1 of the required form , non - abelian symmetries in the hidden sector are required .",
    "these non - abelian symmetries @xmath2 ( _ e.g. _  a 2 - 3 permutation symmetry ) are broken in the portal interactions explicitly or spontaneously . due to the lower scale of these interactions , the symmetry breaking produces only small corrections to the case of exact symmetry under @xmath2 .",
    "the groups @xmath125 and @xmath2 ( and also @xmath126 ) can be embedded in a bigger group @xmath124 . in this way one can realize the approach of residual symmetries such that @xmath124 is broken down to @xmath2 in the hidden sector and to @xmath279 in the portal and visible sector interactions .",
    "the mediator fields have to appear in the portal interaction and can be @xmath193 , or @xmath123 , or some new flavon fields associated to @xmath193 or @xmath123 .",
    "this association needs an additional connecting symmetry with respect to which the flavons and @xmath193 or @xmath123 are charged . for each of these possibilities we provide illustrative examples .    an extended hidden sector with more than three singlets",
    "@xmath123 may open up additional possibilities to explain features of @xmath1 .",
    "the additional fermionic singlets @xmath237 should not participate directly in the portal interaction , otherwise screening will be destroyed .",
    "they can , however , couple with the three @xmath123 , thus modifying the matrix @xmath93 , and in this way can @xmath280  lead to an effective 2 - 3-permutation symmetry in @xmath93 .    new physics and new symmetries are involved in the generation of the ckm mixing and the mass hierarchies of quarks and leptons . in the first approximation so(10 ) allows to disentangle mixing and masses in a very simple way : if a single @xmath77 gives the dominant contribution to the masses , no mixing is produced .",
    "so , we are forced to consider at least partly the ckm physics . in order to disentangle the generation of @xmath281 and @xmath67 from @xmath261 and @xmath270",
    ", we introduced two higgs ten - plets @xmath248 and @xmath252 with identical charges under @xmath125 .",
    "additional flavons , charged under @xmath125 and @xmath126 and connected to the field @xmath252 by a symmetry @xmath263 , allow to generate a non - diagonal @xmath282 .",
    "the difference between @xmath261 and @xmath270 should be obtained in such a way that the relation  ( [ quark - lepton - mixing ] ) is not destroyed .      1 .",
    "further more accurate measurements of the leptonic 1 - 3 and 2 - 3 mixing , and especially the determination of the quadrant of the 2 - 3 mixing are important . the second quadrant for the 2 - 3 mixing angle would disfavour the framework .",
    "specific realizations of the framework may lead to certain predictions for the dirac as well as majorana cp phases .",
    "the neutrino masses are generated at high scales which are not accessible to direct experimental studies .",
    "therefore , one should not expect to see any new physics at the lhc associated directly to neutrino mass generation .",
    "observation of such physics would probably exclude the framework .",
    "indirect support of the approach can be provided by the observation of proton decay ( which will be in favour of grand unification ) .",
    "a connection to leptogenesis and inflation may give another test of the high scale physics .",
    "6 .   discoveries of other possible manifestations of the hidden sector are important .",
    "that includes identification of the dark matter and the discovery of sterile neutrinos .",
