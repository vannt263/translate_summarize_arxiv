    "a lot of attention has been focussed on the interacting electron problem in the last several decades , whereas the interacting boson problem has been considered more often in the framework of specific applications only .",
    "however , there are a number of important situations where the elementary excitations are either intrinsically bosonic in character or else can usefully be viewed in terms of bosonic models .",
    "@xmath0 is an example of the former situation,@xcite while quantum spin systems,@xcite granular superconductors,@xcite and flux lines in type ",
    "ii superconductors@xcite are examples of the latter .",
    "therefore it is important to understand in detail the features of model boson systems , in much the same way that one studies the hubbard , anderson , and t - j hamiltonians for correlated fermions . in this paper",
    "we consider a lattice model of interacting bosons , the bose hubbard ( bh ) hamiltonian : @xmath1 here @xmath2 is a boson annihilation operator at site @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "the transfer integral @xmath5 sets the scale of the energy , and @xmath6 is the chemical potential .",
    "@xmath7 , and @xmath8 are on  site , near  neighbor , and next  near  neighbor boson",
    " boson repulsions .    the interactions @xmath7 , and @xmath8 promote the formation of `` solid '' order , where the boson occupations fall into regular patterns , at special densities commensurate with the lattice .",
    "the hopping matrix element @xmath9 favors mobile bosons , and consequently a superfluid phase at @xmath10 . in what follows the nature of the correlation functions",
    "will be studied as we change the hamiltonian parameters and the density @xmath11 .    when @xmath12 , the bh model maps onto the quantum spin1/2 hamiltonian @xmath13 the field @xmath14 . since @xmath15 , ordering of the density corresponds to finite wave vector ising type order .",
    "similarly , @xmath16 so that superfluidity maps to ferromagnetic ordering in the xy plane . one of the things we shall be interested in in this work is the possibility that density and superfluid order are not mutually exclusive .",
    "indeed , at @xmath17 , the special point @xmath18 corresponds to the heisenberg hamiltonian where ising and xy order coexist .",
    "it has been suggested by various authors@xcite that the addition of further terms like @xmath8 or @xmath19 could stabilize this `` supersolid '' from a special symmetry point to a broader area of the phase diagram .",
    "precisely at the heisenberg antiferromagnet ( af ) , the effect of a field @xmath19 is known : it breaks the full rotational symmetry and selects ordering in the xy plane since the spins can more easily take advantage of the field energy .",
    "this argument has been used to suggest why doping favors the superconducting over the cdw state in the negative@xmath20 hubbard model@xcite where an analogous `` supersolid '' symmetry exists at half  filling .    while there have been many mean field ( mf ) studies of the spin hamiltonian eq .  2",
    ", there have been to date only a few numerical studies @xcite .",
    "monte carlo studies of interacting quantum boson and spin models provide a useful , exact method to study the nature of the correlations on finite lattices . combined with finite size scaling methods",

    "boson simulations are somewhat easier than related path integral methods for interacting electron systems , since they can utilize algorithms which scale linearly with the lattice size and can reach essentially arbitrarily low temperatures .",

    " insulator _ with precisely one boson per site . as the solid and the superfluid phases possess different broken symmetries",
    ", one could expect that the transition between them is first order .",
    "however , a rather different scenario has also been put forward , suggesting that the  presumably  first order transition is split up into two distinct second order transitions , where the two order parameters vanish at separate points@xcite in the regime between the two transitions _ both _ order parameters are non ",
    "zero , hence it has been termed a _",
    "supersolid_.@xcite this intriguing possibility is the subject of the investigations reported in this paper .",
    "the mean field analysis indeed finds such a supersolid phase @xcite , although in the hard core limit longer range forces ( @xmath31 ) are needed to stabilize it .",
    "however , recently it was claimed that this conclusion changes in the soft core case , and a supersolid phase exists with nearest neighbor interaction alone@xcite . finally , recent studies on the related heisenberg model with competing first and second neighbor couplings @xmath32 and @xmath33 established the possibility of additional phases : a collinear phase , with alternating lines of up and down spins , at large @xmath34@xcite , and a disordered phase at intermediate values of @xmath34 .",

    "1 ) is realized for arbitrary values of the near  neighbor repulsion @xmath28 .",
    "the reason is that at half  filling the energy for the collinear solid is @xmath55 , i.e. independent of @xmath28 due to the cancellation of @xmath56 energies for near  neighbor sites on the same and neighboring rows .",

    "first , recalling the original landau argument about superfluidity it is clear that a vanishing roton energy leads to a vanishing critical velocity .",

    "in this continuum limit the modes which go soft are located at a finite magnitude of @xmath111 , i.e. on a _ ring _ in momentum space .",
    "this means that the phase space for these excitations is much larger than for the usual goldstone modes , which are centered around @xmath136 .",

    "10 we show @xmath151 and @xmath176 for the same parameters as fig .",
    "7 except now @xmath191 .",
    "we see that although @xmath151 declines significantly when the solid forms , the excess boson density @xmath192 ( the magnetization @xmath68 is spin language ) remains mobile in the solid background .",
    "indeed , simulations at different densities ( we found supersolids out to dopings of 0.675 ) show that the tail in @xmath151 is precisely proportional to @xmath75 .",
    "11 shows the analogous plot for a striped supersolid .",
    "note that we have here separately displayed @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "as expected , the superfluid density in the @xmath195 and @xmath196 direction is correlated with the direction in which the striped solid channels run , as determined by the ordering wavevector @xmath183 or @xmath184 .",
    "if we had separately measured @xmath197 and @xmath198 on the two sublattices of the checkerboard solid , we would have found an analogous symmetry breaking .",
    "the nonzero value of @xmath199 is closely related to the appearance@xcite of a nonzero order parameter @xmath200 in the language of the spin hamiltonian eq .  2 .",
    "if we were to use finite size scaling techniques to locate the precise phase boundaries , it would be necessary to scale the imaginary time length @xmath149 as a power of the spatial length @xmath201 , where @xmath41 is the dynamic critical exponent .",
    "as we have earlier described , it may be that different values of @xmath41 are associated with the two transitions off half  filling , in which case the finite size scaling analysis is much more delicate.@xcite we do not see the necessity of such a study here , since the supersolid phase occupies an extended portion of the phase diagram , and its existence is not predicated on proving the distinctness of two transition points .",
    "_ figures 10 and 11 provide compelling evidence for the existence of a supersolid phase .",
    "our physical picture of this supersolid is one in which @xmath185 of the bosons freeze into a rigid solid structure , while the remaining @xmath75 remain mobile .",
    "as we have seen , a signal of long range order then is present in both the diagonal @xmath202 and off  diagonal @xmath203 channels .",
    "_    we have conducted our simulations of the bh hamiltonian in the canonical ensemble , and have presented our results by specifying the density @xmath204 rather than the chemical potential @xmath6 . in describing the nature of the phase diagram it is important to note that due to the existence of a gap in the solid phases , the @xmath6@xmath204 relation is non  trivial .",
    "if the gap is nonzero , when we dope our system even slightly away from half  filling , the chemical potential is shifted by a considerable amount . in the language of the spin hamiltonian , eq .  2 , a sizeable field @xmath19 is required to change the magnetization of the gapped ising phase . in fig .",
    "12 we illustrate this point by drawing the @xmath205@xmath206 phase diagram .",
    "a sweep at constant chemical potential reveals a supersolid _",
    "window_. a sweep at fixed density skirts the pure solid and remains in the supersolid phase .",
    "this is why we see in figs .",
    "10 and 11 a supersolid for an extended region @xmath207 rather than in some narrow region between phases exhibiting a single type of order .    if we now examine densities @xmath208 , we find qualitatively similar results : a superfluid phase gives way to a striped supersolid phase as @xmath162 increases . by these measures , hole or",
    "particle doping appears qualitatively similar .",
    "the same is true of the checkerboard supersolid , where results for hole doping are entirely reminiscent of the analogous particle doped case .",
    "in fact , however , something rather different does go on with particle and hole doping . in fig .",
    "13 we show the ground state energy as a function of doping for @xmath170 , @xmath209 , and @xmath210 . for these parameters",
    ", as we have seen , we have a striped supersolid off half  filling and a striped solid at @xmath211 . the change in slope of @xmath212 at @xmath211 reflects a jump in the chemical potential which is , in fact , just the gap in the solid phase.@xcite .",
    "there is nothing particularly unusual here .",
    "the strange feature occurs for the checkerboard case . in fig .",
    "14 we show the ground state energy as a function of doping for @xmath170 , @xmath209 , and @xmath171 .",
    "the fact that @xmath213 is concave down for @xmath214 indicates an instability to phase separation .",
    "previous studies@xcite have suggested the possibility of phase separation in systems with attractive boson interactions .",
    "however , we do not have these lennard  jones type potentials here , only purely repulsive ones .",
    "it is not immediately apparent why mobile holes ( or particles ) in a rigid solid background should segregate themselves .    a possible explanation , however , is as follows : consider an isolated doped hole in a checkerboard solid . in order to move to another site of the same sublattice , it must pass through an intermediate site on the opposite sublattice , a state of energy @xmath215 .",
    "thus the hole s effective hybridization is @xmath216 .",
    "( this sort of argument has previously been used to predict the shape of the phase boundary in the one dimensional extended bh hamiltonian , in good agreement with simulations.@xcite ) if two holes are near each other , the intermediate state is lower in energy , so the effective hybridization is increased .",
    "this suggests a possible mechanism for phase separation : increased mobility of holes which propagate coherently .",
    "of course , the increase in @xmath217 is partially offset by the entropy cost of confining one hole near the other .",
    "unfortunately , there appears to be an analogous increase in @xmath217 for doped particles which are proximate , so this reasoning does not explain the fact that @xmath218 is concave down for @xmath208 only .",
    "nevertheless , the simulations provide compelling evidence for a lack of particle - hole symmetry .    in principle , one can also examine the issue of phase separation through anomalies in @xmath153 for small @xmath94 .",
    "however , our use of the canonical ensemble makes this approach non - trivial .",
    "further work on the question of phase separation is needed .",
    "we now examine the phase diagram in the hard core case .",
    "this is important to do for a number of reasons .",
    "first , it allows us to make a connection to the spin model limit , eq .  2 .",
    "second , as we have seen at @xmath170 , some of the interesting transitions occur at @xmath162 and @xmath8 values which are getting rather large , while we expect in most physical situations that the on  site @xmath84 should be substantially greater than the near neighbor interactions .",
    "one consequence of this , is that the doped bosons in the supersolid phase for our soft  core model could move on the occupied sublattice , since the cost of @xmath84 was less than the coordination number @xmath41 times the near neighbor interaction strengths . in the hard core model such multiple occupancies are forbidden , and we want to make sure that our conclusions are not affected by this change .    fig .",
    "15 shows results for the superfluid density and structure factors for the half  filled case .",
    "we sweep @xmath8 at fixed @xmath219 .",
    "a nel phase appears at small @xmath8 . for larger @xmath8",
    "the superfluid phase appears before making a transition into a collinear solid for yet larger @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath162 is sufficiently small , the nel phase at weak @xmath8 is eliminated , and the system remains superfluid down to @xmath171 .",
    "data for this and other sweeps is summarized in fig .",
    "16 where the resulting ground state phase diagram is shown .",
    "note that we find the superfluid ",
    "nel solid transition at @xmath171 occurs at a value @xmath162 close to @xmath220 , which is the result expected based on the mapping to the spin model , eq .  2 .",
    "as in the soft core case the weak coupling superfluid extends out along the @xmath221 strong coupling boundary between the two solid phases . unlike analogous studies@xcite in 1d , this superfluid wedge is difficult to close , a phenomenon which we earlier explained by the large degeneracy of competing solid phases along the strong coupling line . we have conducted simulations along the line @xmath221 and find that the superfluid density vanishes at @xmath222 .",
    "interestingly , there is no inset of solid order at this point .",
    "this needs further study , for example to understand if some disordered dimer phase might exist in this regime , in analogy with related spin systems .",
    "17 is a plot for a doped lattice with @xmath223 .",
    "the main difference is that , as in the soft  core case , there is a superfluid tail after the structure factor exhibits the transition into the solid phase .",
    "that is , there is a supersolid in the hard ",
    "core case as well .",
    "as expected , doping inhibits somewhat the formation of crystalline order , so that stronger couplings are required to induce the crystalline order as is seen by comparing the doped phase diagram , fig .",
    "18 , with fig .",
    "16 , the phase diagram at half  filling .",
    "despite considerable rounding of the transitions , scaling analyses conclude that the regions where @xmath35 is large are indeed ordered .",
    "finally , figs .",
    "19a , b show the ground state energy as a function of filling for the hard  core model at @xmath224",
    "( nel solid ) , and @xmath225 ( collinear solid ) , respectively .",
    "the data are qualitatively similar to the soft  core model . in the collinear solid @xmath212",
    "is concave up , with a change in slope at @xmath211 which is the gap . in the nel solid @xmath212",
    "shows a tendency for phase separation .",
    "up to now we have focussed on the ground state phase diagram of the bh hamiltonian .",
    "it is interesting to consider also the behavior of the system at finite temperatures . here",
    "the motion of doped bosons in the bh model which we have studied with our simulations has a close connection with the idea of `` defectons '' in a solid@xcite where quantum tunneling caused by the finiteness of the de boer parameter delocalizes lattice defects at low temperature .",
    "it is also of interest to study the behavior of the diffusion constant @xmath226 for the full range of temperature .",
    "here we expect that defects are localized at high @xmath167 , and @xmath226 first decreases exponentially as @xmath167 is lowered in this classical regime .",
    "@xmath226 should then exhibit a plateau as quantum diffusion takes over , and ultimately increase again as delocalization occurs . while they focus largely on the behavior of single defectons , andreev and lifshitz also consider the possibility of long range coulomb interactions causing localization into a `` defecton superlattice '' .",
    "our insulating checkerboard solid is in fact an illustration of this .",
    "the bose  hubbard model with only on  site @xmath84 , has no solid phase at @xmath185 , but when @xmath162 is turned on , an ordered lattice does form .",
    "we have focussed here on zero temperature , the finite temperature phase diagram of the 2d bh model would be interesting to study as well .",
    "the solid transitions are in the ising universality class , and hence have a finite @xmath164 .",
    "similarly one expects a kosterlitz  thouless type finite critical temperature for the superfluid transition . as for the topology of the phase diagram ,",
    "several possibilities have been explored by liu and fisher@xcite .",
    "one intriguing case is the appearence of a tetracritical point ; where the three ordered phases ( superfluid , supersolid and solid ) come together , giving way to the disordered phase with further increase of the temperature .",
    "this happens within a limited , but finite range of parameters on the mean field level .",
    "the corresponding scaling theory was developed by nelson and fisher @xcite .",
    "other alternatives include a supersolid phase which exists only at finite temperatures , and that the tetracritical point is split into bicritical points.@xcite we hope to take up some of the issues in a further publication .    in the path integral representation of the bh partition function used in our simulations , the particle number conservation leads to boson `` world lines '' propagating in the original 2 spatial dimensions plus an additional imaginary time direction which runs from 0 to @xmath148 .",
    "this picture has been used to suggest close analogies between the physics of vortices in type ii superconductors@xcite and the phase diagram of the 2d bose ",
    "hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "frey , nelson , and fisher,@xcite have recently discussed both thermally driven and quantum phase transitions , for example as caused by the introduction of defects or interstitials into the abrikosov lattice , in these vortex systems .",
    "this also has close connections with the results we have discussed here .",
    "in this paper we have considered quantum phase transitions in the bose  hubbard hamiltonian .",

    "the dynamical critical exponents at each transitions were calculated and preexisting controversies were settled .",
    "our numerical work  utilizing quantum monte carlo methods  provided a detailed study of the different phases . concerning the phase diagram the existence of supersolid phases",

    "these phases exist only off half  filling , in accordance with the mean field results , but in disagreement with some recent claims .",
