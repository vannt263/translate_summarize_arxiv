    "[ secdist ] , the gvbs become fully permutation - invariant for any @xmath1 . consequently , the ( optimized and non - optimized ) telecloning fidelity for distributing coherent states is equal for any pair of sender - receiver parties .",
    "these resources are thus useful for @xmath171 symmetric telecloning . however , due to the monogamy constraints on distribution of cv entanglement @xcite , this two - party fidelity will decrease with increasing @xmath1 , vanishing in the limit @xmath172 where the resources become completely separable . in this respect",
    ", it is worth pointing out that the fully symmetric gvbs resources are more useful for teleportation networks @xcite , where @xmath173 parties first perform local measurements ( momentum detections ) on their single - mode portion of the entangled resource to concentrate as much entanglement as possible onto the two - mode state of alice and bob , who can accomplish non - classical teleportation ( after the outcomes of the @xmath173 measurements are classically communicated to bob ) . in this case",
    ", the optimal fidelity of @xmath1-user teleportation network is an estimator of _ multipartite _ entanglement in the shared @xmath1-mode resource @xcite , which is indeed a gvbs obtained from an infinitely entangled building block .",
    "the valence bond picture is a valuable framework to study the structure of correlations in quantum states of harmonic lattices .",
    "in fact , the motivation for such a formalism is quite different from the finite - dimensional case , where valence bond / matrix product states are useful to efficiently approximate ground states of @xmath1-body systems  generally described by a number of parameters exponential in @xmath1  with polynomial resources @xcite . in continuous variable systems ,",
    "the key feature of gvbs lies in the understanding of their entanglement distribution as governed by the properties of simpler structures @xcite .",
    "this has also experimental implications giving a robust recipe to engineer correlations in many - body gaussian states from feasible operations on the building blocks .",
    "we have provided a simple scheme to produce bisymmetric three - mode building blocks with linear optics , and discussed the subsequent implementation of the valence bond construction .",
    "we have also investigated the usefulness of such gvbs as resources for nonclassical communication , like telecloning of unknown coherent states to distant receivers on a harmonic ring",
    ". it would be interesting to employ the valence bond picture to describe quantum computation with continuous - variable cluster states @xcite , and to devise efficient protocols for its optical implementation .",
