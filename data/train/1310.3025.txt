    "thus , the above parameters are just constants . in particular , these values do not depend on the curvature of the interface and should be calculated for a flat interface .",
    "a dependence of these parameters on the surface curvature would make the theory non - local .",
    "as this is inherently inconsistent with the square gradient description , we will not study this here .",
