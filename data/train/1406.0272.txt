    "artificial materials with engineered properties have recently attracted a lot of attention .",
    "a well - known paradigm is the parity - time ( @xmath2 ) symmetric systems , whose properties rely on a delicate balance between gain and loss . the ideas and notions of @xmath3symmetric materials , which do not separately obey the parity ( @xmath4 ) and and time ( @xmath5 ) symmetries , instead exhibiting a combined @xmath2 symmetry , have their roots in non - hermitian quantum mechanics @xcite . the theory has been extended to optical lattices @xcite , and the predicted @xmath3symmetry breaking as well as other properties have been experimentally observed in optical @xcite and microresonator @xcite systems .",
    "the theory subsequently evolved to include nonlinear lattices @xcite and oligomers @xcite .",
    "the application of these ideas in electronic circuits @xcite , provides a convenient platform for testing @xmath3related ideas within the framework of easily accessible experimental configurations .",
    "also , the construction of @xmath3metamaterials , reliant on gain and loss - providing components , has been recently suggested @xcite .",
    "@xmath3symmetric systems can migrate from the exact into the broken phase as the parameters of the system are varied . in the exact phase ,",
    "@xmath3symmetric systems have real eigenvalues , and thus propagating modes as well as bound states , despite being non - hermitian .",
    "one essential difference from conventional systems is that the total energy , instead of being conserved , oscillates because the eigenmodes are not orthogonal .",
    "another consequence of the non - orthogonality of the eigenmodes is non - reciprocal propagation @xcite , an asymmetry in the propagation in the two channels , even as the initial conditions are reversed . in the broken phase ,",
    "the energy increases exponentially , and the propagation is unstable : amplified under gain or decaying with loss .",
    "the band structure of the system in the broken phase acquires imaginary components for some values of the wavevector @xcite .",
    "experimentally , grating structures have been synthesized and used to demonstrate greatly enhanced or reduced reflection in the broken phase @xcite , paving the way for more extensive studies of these remarkable phenomena , and later , for the design of new devices exploiting them .",
    "recently , a @xmath3symmetric coherent perfect absorber was realized which can completely absorb light in its exact phase @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "two different @xmath3symmetric models are investigated : a system consisting of two coupled linear oscillators ( classical dimer ) , and a linear schrdinger dimer ( lsd ) .",
    "both systems include terms providing gain and loss , which render them @xmath3symmetric . in most previous works implementation ,",
    "the gain / loss parameter remains constant in time , although recently a time - varying gain / loss function has been implemented in coupled fibre loops @xcite .",
    "more generalized @xmath3symmetric dimer models in various contexts , that include cubic or other nonlinearities and constant gain / loss functions , have been also investigated theoretically @xcite .",
    "moreover , the addition of a second spatial dimension in the nonlinear schrdinger dimer , which activates spatial dispersion , results in the appearence of solitons and rogue waves as in @xmath3symmetric dual - core waveguides @xcite . in extended nonlinear @xmath3symmetric lattices , on the other hand , the existence of localized excitations in the form of discrete solitons @xcite and discrete breathers @xcite has been demonstrated . in the present work , a periodic in time gain / loss function having an opposite effect on the two components is considered . when averaged over one period",
    ", the amount of gain equals the loss in each component .",
    "this time - dependence of the gain / loss function introduces yet another parameter into the problem , and this results in multiple @xmath2 transitions from the exact phase , where stable propagation exists , to the broken phase , where all solutions diverge . in the following",
    "we describe the two above - mentioned systems and discuss the methods used in their analysis .",
    "the next section is devoted to the @xmath3symmetric classical dimer , while a description of the @xmath3symmetric lsd is given in section 3 .",
    "the conclusions are presented in the last section .",

    "how re - entrant @xmath3symmetry transitions have been predicted in single classical oscillator with a periodically varied gain / loss parameter  @xcite , the coupling parameter @xmath12 of the classical dimer induces another layer of @xmath3symmetry transitions . for small values of @xmath12 the phase space for re - entrant @xmath3symmetry transitions is reduced , while above a critical value @xmath128 the transitions return and the system achieves greater stability as the coupling is increased beyond this point . note that @xmath3symmetry transitions as a function of the coupling strength have been recently observed in a coupled microresonator system @xcite .",
    "the solutions of the two dimer models considered here display similar characteristics , such as a phase shift between the oscillator or field amplitudes correspondingly , as well as a non - conservation of oscillator or probability amplitude in the exact @xmath3symmetric phase , and this distinguishes them from conventional ( undamped ) stability .",
    "it is important to note that the two dimer models only reduce to the behaviour of a single classical oscillator , or `` zero - dimensional '' @xmath3symmetric system @xcite that we chose as a benchmark here , under very specific and different conditions : paths , _",
    "i.e. _ slices of phase space , and order of limits taken . as well",
    ", the two dimer systems may have very similar behaviour but they display subtle differences , particularly in the case of a constant gain / loss function @xmath42 studied in great detail here . in order to make their behaviour coincide , limiting approaches need to be taken in a specific , and opposite sequence .",
    "the path - dependent and/or limiting behaviour is very important to be aware of in making correspondences between classical or wave - based models or in comparing or interpreting results from experiments belonging to the two different classes . as these simple dimer systems can be used as basic elements for the fabrication of larger networks comprised of dimers as in refs .",
    "@xcite , understanding the properties of the dimer elements is invaluable for deducing the properties of the system as a whole .",
