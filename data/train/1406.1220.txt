    "we start by reviewing the motivation for characterizing cube structures for systems with a single transformation , which was first developed for ergodic measure preserving systems . to show the convergence of some multiple ergodic averages , host and kra @xcite introduced for each @xmath2 a factor @xmath3 which characterizes the behaviour of those averages .",
    "they proved that this factor can be endowed with a structure of a nilmanifold : it is measurably isomorphic to an inverse limit of ergodic rotations on nilmanifolds .",
    "to build such a structure , they introduced cube structures over the set of measurable functions of x to itself and they studied their properties .",
    "later , host , kra and maass @xcite introduced these cube structures into topological dynamics . for @xmath4 a minimal dynamical system and for @xmath2",

    "recently , shao and ye @xcite proved that @xmath7}$ ] is an equivalence relation in any minimal system and the quotient by this relation is the maximal nilfactor of order @xmath6 .",
    "this theory is important in studying the structure of @xmath8-topological dynamical systems and recent applications of it can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "back to ergodic theory , a natural generalization of the averages considered by host and kra @xcite are averages arise from a measurable preserving system of commuting transformations @xmath9 .",
    "the convergence of these averages was first proved by tao @xcite with further insight given by towsner @xcite , austin @xcite and host @xcite .",
    "we focus our attention on host s proof . in order to prove the convergence of the averages , host built an extension of @xmath10 ( _ magic _ in his terminology ) with suitable properties . in this extension",
