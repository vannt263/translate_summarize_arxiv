    "<S> the snr is defined as @xmath7 the better performance of the total variation regularization stems from the fact that discontinuities along edges are preserved while the sobolev semi - norm introduces severe blurring of the edges .      in a recent work louis et al @xcite discuss a problem of density estimation , which requires the inversion of the funk - radon transform on the @xmath8-sphere . in general , for arbitrary space dimension , the funk - radon transform maps a function defined on the @xmath8-sphere to its means over the great circles . </S>",
