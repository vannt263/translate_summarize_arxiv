    "kernel methods such as those based on radial basis functions ( rbfs ) are becoming increasingly popular for numerically solving partial differential equations ( pdes ) because they are geometrically flexible , algorithmically accessible , and can be highly accurate . since kansa s pioneering work  @xcite , there have been many successful applications of kernel methods to various types of pdes defined on planar regions in two and higher dimensions ( see , for example ,  ( * ? ? ? * ch .",
    "3845 ) and the references therein ) .",
    "more recently , these methods have been developed and applied to pdes defined on the surface of a sphere  @xcite .    in this paper , we present a high - order kernel method using rbfs for numerically solving certain pdes defined on more general surfaces . in particular , we focus on diffusion and reaction - diffusion equations on smooth , closed embedded submanifolds @xmath3 . in the case of two species ,",
    "the prototypical form of the latter type of these pdes is @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 are ( possibly non - linear ) scalar functions , and @xmath8 is the laplace - beltrami operator for the surface . for two dimensional surfaces embedded in three dimensional space ,",
    "systems like have received growing interest to model such things as diffusion of chemicals on biological cells or membranes  @xcite , pattern formations in biology  @xcite , nonlinear chemical oscillators in excitable media  @xcite , and texture mappings in computer graphics  @xcite .    in the past decade , many methods have been developed for pdes like on surfaces .",
    "nearly all of these techniques can be classified into two types , _ intrinsic methods _ and _ embedded , narrow - band methods_. the former methods use coordinates intrinsic to the surface and a surface - based mesh to discretize the differential operators ( e.g.  @xcite ) , while the latter methods extend the entire pde in @xmath1 in a narrow band around the surface and then modify the differential operators so that the solution is restricted to the surface ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "intrinsic methods have the benefit that the resulting discretization scheme is consistent with the dimension of the original problem .",
    "however , properly dealing with the inherent coordinate distortions or singularities that arise in the metric terms of the surface differential operators can be difficult , and these methods are generally limited to low orders of accuracy .",
    "embedded , narrow - band methods have the benefit that the surface differential operators are posed in extrinsic coordinates so that all coordinate singularities can be avoided and standard methods such as finite differences on 3d cartesian grids , or finite elements on 3d unstructured meshes can be used .",
    "additionally , the surface can be naturally represented using standard level - set methods , and thus quite topologically complicated surfaces can be handled . however , these methods require consistent extensions of the initial data on the surface to the embedding space , which can be non - trivial . also , some of these methods ( e.g.  @xcite ) lead to degenerate surface differential operators since , for example , they allow diffusion to occur only in directions tangential to the surface .",
    "this makes it difficult to use implicit discretization techniques for time - dependent problems .",
    "additionally , the need to implement artificial boundary conditions in the embedding space can lead to accuracy degradations  @xcite .",
    "finally , all embedded methods have an added computational expense since they solve the equations in a dimension at least one greater than that in which the equations are posed .",
    "this added expense can grow quite significantly depending on the surface , the order of the differential operators , and the order of accuracy of the method  @xcite .",
    "the present kernel method combines many of the benefits of both the intrinsic and narrow band methods .",
    "it uses a semi - discrete approach ( or the method - of - lines ) in which the surface derivative operators ( e.g. surface laplacian ) that appear in the pdes are approximated using collocation .",
    "these approximations are made using rbf interpolation on surfaces  @xcite . in this way , the method is similar to the ones used in  @xcite for the surface of a sphere .",
    "however , the new method applies to more general surfaces , including those that can be defined parametrically or implicitly ( as the level - set of a function ) .",
    "since the method is based on rbfs , it allows the computational nodes to be placed at `` scattered '' locations on the surface ( see figure [ fig : ex_surfaces ] for examples ) .",
    "furthermore , it does not rely on any surface - based metrics or intrinsic coordinate systems , thus avoiding any coordinate distortions or singularities . in this regard ,",
    "our kernel method is similar to the embedded , narrow - band methods discussed above .",
    "the difference is that our method approximates the surface differential operators directly on the surface instead of having to extend quantities off the surface and do the approximations in @xmath9 .",
    "thus , like the intrinsic methods , our method is posed in the same dimension as the original problem . this ability to directly approximate",
    "the differential operator also means that no degeneracies arise from having to modify the equations so that the solutions remain restricted to the surface .",
    "furthermore , computational efficiencies are gained by not having to extend into the full three dimensional space to solve the problems .",
    "recently , a different kernel method based on rbfs was introduced by piret for solving pdes on surfaces , which is called the orthogonal gradients ( ogr ) method @xcite .",
    "this method shares many similarities to the embedded , narrow band method known as the closest point method @xcite and is different from our method in a number of ways .",
    "for example , the ogr method requires expanding into the embedding space ( @xmath1 ) to obtain discrete surface differential operators , which increases the computational complexity .",
    "further , a differentiation matrix is constructed by enforcing that the first and second normal derivatives to the surface of a certain rbf interpolant vanish .",
    "this means in particular that one must analytically calculate the derivatives of the normal vectors to the surface , which requires that a smooth representation of the surfaces is known .",
    "in contrast , our method only requires nodes at scattered locations on the surface and the corresponding normal vectors to the surface , and does not require expanding into @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the discrete operators for the present method are constructed from the inversion of a single traditional positive - definite kernel interpolation matrix , which is guaranteed to be invertible .",
    "additionally , we provide a theory for the convergence of the discrete surface differential operators .",
    "the application of kernel methods ( including rbfs ) to problems on general surfaces is still in its infancy .",
    "the goal of this paper is thus to investigate some of the theoretical and applied aspects of our kernel method and to establish its applicability . as a result",
    ", we ( a ) present error estimates for approximating various surface differential operators ; ( b ) numerically investigate the stability and accuracy of the method , showing how solutions can be computed to very high orders of accuracy ; and ( c ) apply the method to two relevant problems in biology and chemistry .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in next section ,",
    "we briefly review kernel interpolation with rbfs .",
    "we follow this with a short presentation in section [ sec : operators ] on how to formulate surface differential operators in cartesian coordinates .",
    "section [ sec : kernel_method ] describes how these surface differential operators are discretized in the form of differentiation matrices and presents the kernel method in method - of - lines form . making heavy use of the results from  @xcite , we provide error estimates for the discrete surface derivatives in section [ sec : convergence ] ( and proofs in appendix [ proofappendix ] ) .",
    "section [ sec : eigen_stability ] numerically investigates the eigenvalue stability of the kernel method .",
    "we numerically demonstrate the convergence the method for the forced scalar diffusion equation to two different surfaces in section [ sec : numerical_results ] .",
    "applications of the method to simulations of pattern formations in a turing system and to spiral waves in excitable media are presented in section [ sec : applications ] .",
    "we conclude with some comments on potential future enhancements of the method in section [ sec : concluding_remarks ] .    before continuing to the main body of the paper , we pause to make some relevant remarks on what follows . while there are many types of classifications of surfaces or manifolds , in our work",
    ", we use the term surface or manifold to always refer to a smooth embedded submanifold of @xmath0 with no boundary .",
    "we use the notation @xmath10 to denote the manifold . for simplicity",
    ", we present our method for manifolds of dimension 2 embedded in @xmath1 .",
    "however , it can be naturally extended to manifolds of codimension 1 embedded in @xmath0 .",
    "although not pursued here , more technical , but straightforward extensions are possible for manifolds of higher codimension .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     spiral waves",
    "can be observed in many excitable chemical , biological , and physical media  @xcite .",
    "important examples include belousov - zhabotinsky chemical reactions and electrical activity in the membranes of organisms .",
    "while numerical methods have been developed for these models in planar domains ( see  @xcite and the corresponding software ez - spiral ) , there has been growing interest in studying these models on non - planar surfaces since most physically relevant problems occur on curved surfaces and curvatrue can effect the wave processes  @xcite . to illustrate how our kernel method may be applied to these models , we focus on a simple two - variable reaction - diffusion model used in  @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be viewed as some chemical concentrations or as membrane potential and current .",
    "the parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 govern the reaction kinetics and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the diffusivities of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 species respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is chosen as @xmath19 so that the @xmath12 field takes on the values @xmath20 or @xmath21 almost everywhere , with a thin interface ( or reaction zone ) separating these two regions .",
    "the system is of fitzhugh - nagumo type  @xcite and provides a simple model for dynamics of many excitable media .",
    "these types of systems have also been studied on the surface of the sphere  @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : spiral_waves ] displays snap shots from the numerical solution of on the bumpy sphere and dupin s cyclide at different times of the simulation .",
    "for all of these experiments we set the initial conditions to @xmath22 , \\\\",
    "v(0,{{\\mathbf{x } } } ) & = \\frac12\\left[1 - \\tanh(3z)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath23 .",
    "values for the parameters that remain fixed for the two surfaces are as follows : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the values of @xmath17 vary depending on the surface as follows : @xmath28 for the bumpy sphere and @xmath29 .",
    "these values are similar to those used in one of the experiments from  @xcite on a 2-d planar domain .",
    "the two quasi - periodic , counter - rotating spiral waves seen on both surfaces in figure [ fig : spiral_waves ] are qualitatively similar to those observed on the sphere in  @xcite .",
    "these spiral waves remain intact but meander around the surfaces throughout the simulation time .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced a new kernel method based on collocation with rbfs for constructing discrete approximations to differential operators on surfaces , with a focus on surfaces of dimension 2 embedded in @xmath1 .",
    "the method is different than other methods for approximating surface differential operators in that it only requires `` scattered '' nodes on the surface and the corresponding normal vectors , it does not require expanding into the @xmath1 embedding space , and it can give high - orders of accuracy .",
    "we have studied the approximation power of the method and have provided error estimates for target functions of various smoothness .",
    "we have used the method to construct discrete approximations to the surface laplacian and combined it in a method - of - lines approach to numerically solve diffusion and reaction - diffusion equations on surfaces .",
    "we presented numerical results for two forced diffusion equations , illustrating the convergence of the method for kernels with finite and infinite smoothness .",
    "the numerical results for the finitely smooth kernels indicate that the convergence rates are faster than our theory predicts , which may be related to some form of super - convergence common to spline methods .",
    "finally , we have illustrated the flexibility of our method by successfully applying it to two important problems in biology and chemistry .",
    "the primary shortcoming of the method is the @xmath30 computational cost for applying these operators . in a follow up study",
    ", we intend to address this issue by using a local rbf finite - difference ( rbf - fd ) method for constructing the approximate surface differential operators .",
    "this method has been used successfully in  @xcite to overcome the computational cost of the global method  @xcite for the shallow water wave equations on the sphere and has recently been adapted to multi - gpu architectures in  @xcite .",
    "we expect the cost of constructing and applying these discrete operators based on rbf - fd to be reduced to @xmath31 , with a minor decrease in the order of accuracy .",
    "these enhancements may make the method competitive for solving diffusion and reaction - diffusion equations on evolving surfaces , which is also important in many biological applications .",
    "in this section we present the convergence results for our discrete differential operators .",
    "the results presented here are for the special case when @xmath32 is a two dimensional surface , although similar results hold in higher dimensions .",
    "the arguments will depend heavily on error estimates for kernel interpolants on smooth , embedded submanifolds of @xmath0 given recently in @xcite .",
    "we will frequently reference results from that paper throughout this section .",
    "sobolev error estimates for the surface gradient and divergence operators will immediately follow the results in @xcite .",
    "however , the estimates for the discrete surface laplacian will require more work .",
    "[ prop : discretegraddivallkernels ] let @xmath33 , @xmath34 be a positive definite kernel satisfying with @xmath35 , and define @xmath36 . then there is a constant @xmath37 depending only on @xmath10 such that if a finite node set @xmath38 satisfies @xmath39 , for all @xmath40 and @xmath41 we have @xmath42 where @xmath43 if @xmath44 and is zero otherwise .    we will focus on the discrete gradient operator .",
    "we have @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the @xmath47 sobolev space of order 1 ( see section 2 , @xcite ) .",
    "the assumptions on @xmath48 allow us to apply theorem 4.6 in @xcite , and the results follow .",
    "the error bounds in theorem 4.6 in @xcite carry over to the vector - valued case , thus bounds for the divergence operator error are obtained in a similar manner .",
    "when @xmath34 satisfies , i.e. @xmath34 has finite smoothness , the estimates come in two types : the first concerns targets that may be too rough to be within the native space , and the second applies to functions with additional smoothness .",
    "this additional smoothness is measured with the inverse of the integral operator , @xmath49 .",

    "similar to the proof above , the result below follows from theorem 4.12 and corollary 4.10 in @xcite .",
