    "coding for cooperative wireless relay networks has attracted considerable attention recently . distributed space time coding was proposed as a coding strategy to achieve full cooperative diversity in @xcite assuming that the signals from all the relay nodes arrive at the destination at the same time . but this assumption is not close to practicality since the relay nodes are geographically distributed . in @xcite , a transmission scheme based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) at the relay nodes",
    "was proposed to combat the timing errors at the relays and a high rate space time code ( stc ) construction was also provided . however , the maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoding complexity for this scheme is prohibitively high especially for the case of large number of relays .",
    "several other works in the literature propose methods to combat the timing offsets but most of them are based on decode and forward at the relay node and moreover fail to address the decoding complexity issue . in @xcite , a simple transmission scheme to combat timing errors at the relay nodes was proposed .",
    "this scheme is particularly interesting because of its associated low ml decoding complexity . in this scheme",
    ", ofdm is implemented at the source node and time reversal / conjugation is performed at the relay nodes on the received ofdm symbols from the source node .",
    "the received signals at the destination after ofdm demodulation are shown to have the alamouti code structure and hence single symbol maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoding can be performed .",
    "however , the alamouti code is applicable only for the case of two relay nodes and for larger number of relays , the authors of @xcite propose to cluster the relay nodes and employ alamouti code in each cluster .",
    "but this clustering technique provides diversity order of only two and fails to exploit the full cooperative diversity equal to the number of relay nodes .",
    "the main contributions of this report are as follows .",
    "* the li - xia transmission scheme is extended to a more general transmission scheme that can achieve full asynchronous cooperative diversity for any number of relays . *",
    "the conditions on the stc structure that admit its application in the proposed transmission scheme are identified . the recently proposed full diversity four",
    "group decodable distributed stcs in @xcite for synchronous wireless relay networks are found to satisfy the required conditions for application in the proposed transmission scheme . *",
    "it is shown how differential encoding at the source node can be combined with the proposed transmission scheme to arrive at a transmission scheme that can achieve full asynchronous cooperative diversity in the absence of channel knowledge and in the absence of knowledge of the timing errors of the relay nodes . moreover ,",
    "an existing class of four group decodable distributed differential stcs @xcite for synchronous relay networks with power of two number of relays is shown to be applicable in this setting as well .      in section [ sec2 ] , the basic assumptions on the relay network model",
    "are given and the li - xia transmission scheme is briefly described .",
    "section [ sec3 ] describes the transmission scheme proposed in this report and also provides four group decodable codes for any number of relays .",

    "the transmission scheme in @xcite is based on the use of ofdm at the source node and the alamouti code implemented in a distributed fashion for a @xmath11 relay system .",
    "essentially , the transmission scheme in @xcite is applicable mainly for the case of @xmath11 relays but by forming clusters of two relay nodes , it can be extended to more number of relays at the cost of sacrificing diversity benefits .",

    "the transmission of information from the source node to the destination node takes place in two phases . in the first phase",
    ", the source broadcasts the information to the relay nodes using ofdm .",
    "the relay nodes receive the faded and noise corrupted ofdm symbols , process them and transmit them to the destination . the relay nodes are assumed to have perfect carrier synchronization .",

    "the resulting two ofdm symbols denoted by @xmath30 and @xmath31 consisting of @xmath32 complex numbers are broadcasted to the two relays using a fraction @xmath33 of the total average @xmath34 consumed by the source and the relay nodes together .    if the channel fade gains are assumed to be constant for @xmath35 ofdm symbol intervals , the received signals at the @xmath14-th relay during the @xmath16-th ofdm symbol duration is given by    @xmath36    where , @xmath37 is the additive white gaussian noise at the @xmath14-th relay node during the @xmath16 the ofdm symbol duration .",

    "example [ eg_5relay ] illustrates how the proposed transmission scheme can be extended to odd number of relays as well .",
    "in this section , it is shown how differential encoding can be combined with the proposed transmission scheme described in section [ sec3 ] and then the codes in @xcite are proposed for application in this setting .    for the proposed transmission scheme in section [ sec3 ] , at the end of one transmission frame , we have in the @xmath42-th sub carrier @xmath43 .",
    "note that the channel matrix @xmath44 depends on @xmath45 .",
    "thus the destination node needs to have the knowledge of these values in order to perform ml decoding .",
    "now using differential encoding ideas which were proposed in @xcite for non - coherent communication in synchronous relay networks , we combine them with the proposed asynchronous transmission scheme . supposing the channel remains approximately constant for two transmission frames , then differential encoding can be done at the source node in each sub carrier @xmath46 as follows : @xmath47^t,~ \\mathbf{s_k^t}=\\frac{1}{a_t-1}\\mathbf{c_t}\\mathbf{s_k^{t-1 } } , \\mathbf{c_t}\\in\\mathscr{c}\\ ] ] where , @xmath48 denotes the vector of complex symbols transmitted by the source during the @xmath14-th transmission frame in the @xmath42-th sub carrier and @xmath49 is the codebook used by the source which consists of scaled unitary matrices such that @xmath50=1 $ ] .",
    "if for all @xmath51 ,    @xmath52 then we have :    @xmath53    from which @xmath54 can be decoded as in each sub carrier @xmath46 .    note that this decoder does not require the knowledge of @xmath55 at the destination .",
    "it turns out that the four group decodable distributed differential space time codes constructed in @xcite for synchronous relay networks with power of two number of relays meet all the requirements for use in the proposed transmission scheme as well .",
    "the following example illustrates this fact .",
    "let @xmath56 .",
    "the codebook at the source is given by + where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and .",
    "differential encoding is done at the source node for each sub carrier @xmath46 as follows : @xmath47^t,~ \\mathbf{s_k^t}=\\frac{1}{a_t-1}\\mathbf{c_t}\\mathbf{s_k^{t-1 } } , \\mathbf{c_t}\\in\\mathscr{c}.\\ ] ] once we get @xmath61 from the above equation , the @xmath27 length vectors @xmath62 can be obtained .",
    "then idft / dft is applied on these vectors as shown below and broadcasted to the relay nodes .",

    "decoding for @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath71 can be done separately in every sub carrier due to the four group decodable structure of @xmath49 .     relay system with and without channel knowledge , width=5 ]",
    "in this section , we study the error performance of the proposed codes using simulations .",
    "we take @xmath56 , @xmath72 and the length of cp as @xmath73 .",
    "the delay @xmath18 at each relay is chosen randomly between @xmath74 to @xmath75 with uniform distribution .",
    "two cases are considered for simulation : ( 1 ) with channel knowledge at the destination and ( 2 ) without channel knowledge at the destination . for the case of no channel information ,",
    "differential encoding at the source as described in section [ sec4 ] is done using the distributed differential space time in @xcite .",
    "when channel knowledge is available at the destination , rotated qpsk is used as the signal set @xcite .",
    "the transmission rate for the both the schemes is @xmath76 bit per channel use ( bpcu ) if the rate loss due to cp is neglected .",
    "the error performance curves for both the cases is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_simulation ] .",
    "it can be observed from fig .",
    "[ fig_simulation ] that the error performance of the no channel knowledge case performs approximately @xmath77 db worser than that with channel knowledge at the destination .",
    "this is due to the differential transmission / reception technique in part and also in part because of the change in signal set from rotated qpsk to some other signal set @xcite in order to comply with the requirement of scaled unitary codeword matrices .",
    "the change in signal set for the sake of scaled unitary codeword matrices results in a reduction of the coding gain .",
    "a general transmission scheme for arbitrary number of relays that can achieve full cooperative diversity in the presence of timing errors at the relay nodes was proposed .",
    "it was then pointed out that the four group decodable distributed space time codes in @xcite can be applied in the proposed transmission scheme for any number of relay nodes .",
    "finally it was shown how the proposed scheme can be combined with differential encoding at the source node to end up with a transmission scheme that is robust to timing errors and also does not require the knowledge of the channel fading gains as well as the timing errors at any of the nodes . for this differential scheme ,",
    "it was pointed out that the four group decodable distributed differential space time codes in @xcite are applicable for power of two number of relays .",
    "a drawback of the proposed transmission scheme is that it requires a large coherence interval spanning over multiple ofdm symbol durations .",
    "moreover there is a rate loss due to the use of cp , but this loss can be made negligible by choosing a large enough @xmath27 . some of the interesting directions for further work are listed below :    1 .   constructing single symbol decodable distributed space time codes for the proposed transmission scheme .",
    "2 .   the codes in @xcite are applicable only for power of two number of relay nodes . constructing four",
    "group decodable distributed differential space time codes for all even number of relay nodes that are applicable in asynchronous relay networks without channel knowledge is an important direction for further work .",
