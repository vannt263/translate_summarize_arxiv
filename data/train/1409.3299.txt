    "in conventional solid state physics , the thomas - fermi model is regarded as an historical development and a pedagogical tool ( although it remains a key ingredient of modern , orbital - free density functional theory ) .",
    "conversely , in certain extreme conditions of solid state astrophysics , where order - of - magnitude estimates of thermodynamic quantities are sought , the failure to predict binding / condensation of atoms is not a serious deficiency due to matter being under high pressure , and appropriate _ ab initio _ methods are in a state of infancy , the thomas - fermi model has not yet faded into obsolescence . in particular , _ magnetic _ thomas - fermi models first written down in the 1970s , and extended in many directions in the 1980 - 90s , continue to be relied upon for the equation of state of magnetized neutron star outer envelopes  see @xcite , the review by @xcite , and references within .",
    "magnetic thomas - fermi ( mtf ) models are aimed at matter composed of heavy atoms in a highly non - perturbative magnetic field , and are reasonably appropriate for the outer @xmath1 meters ( in this paper ,  outer envelopes \" ) of many neutron stars , where @xmath2 g / cc and @xmath3-@xmath4 gauss . for a free electron",
    ", @xmath4 gauss corresponds to a magnetic length @xmath5 times smaller than the bohr radius @xmath6 , and zero - point cyclotron energy ( or zeeman energy ) more than @xmath7 of the rest mass .",
    "this physical regime has also been treated by kohn - sham density functional theory @xcite  potentially much more accurate than the mtf model , which is only asymptotically exact . however , these more sophisticated calculations have not yet been made fully self - consistent ( in the case of 3d condensed matter ) , and the focus has been on prediction of binding energies and the related question of magnetic condensation at neutron star surfaces @xcite , rather than lattice dynamical properties which are the main focus of this work .",
    "lattice dynamical properties have been extensively studied in a higher density , completely pressure ionized regime , using coulomb crystal models ( see @xcite , @xcite , and included references ) .",
    "an under - appreciated property of the mtf model is that its regime of asymptotic exactness contains many field configurations for which bloch s theorem can be proved .",
    "( in other huge magnetic field regimes , use of periodic boundary conditions may not be so innocuous . )",
    "but as with its nonmagnetic counterpart , it has been standard practice to replace the properly periodized mtf model with an approximate version having spherical wigner - seitz cells and a vanishing normal derivative at the cell edge .",
    "physics related to bulk phase stability is out of the reach of this approximation , due to the lack of an explicit lattice .",
    "here we attempt to extract some of this physics by extending a novel domain decomposition approach invented by @xcite .",
    "while m&h could not reach the threshold accuracy required to resolve subtle energy differences between structures , we significantly improve their method by incorporating curved subdomain interfaces with the appropriate symmetry , and implement the improved method making use of the _ hypre _ library of scalable , multigrid - preconditioned solvers @xcite .",
    "we then calculate the equation of state , phase diagram , elastic constants , brillouin zone edge phonon frequency , and exchange correction in the periodized mtf model .",
    "some of these calculations were run on the stampede cluster through xsede @xcite .    to the extent that calculations involve energy",
    "_ differences _ between structures , states of strain , etc . , the divergence of the electron density at the nuclei predicted by the mtf model is not necessarily a significant source of error .",
    "the incorrectly described regions , close to the nuclei , have a weak dependence on lattice structure , and thus their contribution to relative phase stabilities or elastic response tends to cancel out .",
    "similar fortuitous cancellations are seen ubiquitously in lower pressure electronic structure calculations at the density functional level @xcite , and underlie the enormous success of the local density approximation in predicting structural phase diagrams , phonon frequencies , and elastic constants ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "other properties such as formation energies of solids from atomic constituents  where one of the comparison systems does not form a compact lattice  do require more careful treatment of gradients .",
    "the starting point for improving upon a thomas - fermi model is the inclusion of a weizscker ( gradient ) term in the kinetic energy functional .",
    "unfortunately , the form of the weizscker correction to the mtf model is not generally known @xcite , although it has been explored in certain limits @xcite . here",
    "we confine ourselves to physical quantities that benefit from the cancellations described above .    among our findings",
    "is a type of lattice instability that is typically driven by the splitting of sharp features in the electronic density of states due to a symmetry - lowering .",
    "it is interesting that the mtf model , which has no  density of states , \" should capture this kind of symmetry - lowering transition , and it is perhaps the simplest model that does so .",
    "we begin by recapitulating the mtf regime as it pertains to an isolated , heavy atom @xcite .",
    "define the reduced field @xmath8 where @xmath9 gauss .",
    "a strong field is next defined as one in which the magnetic length @xmath10 beats out the zero - field mean electron spacing @xmath11 as the smallest length scale in the problem : @xmath12 . instead of the standard three - dimensional behavior @xmath13",
    ", the fermi momentum follows the lowest landau level expression @xmath14 in a strong field @xmath15 , which modifies the usual @xmath16 dependence of the kinetic energy density to @xmath17 .",
    "mtf description additionally requires the electrostatic potential to vary slowly on the lengthscale @xmath18 , and simple scaling relations indicate this condition is met when @xmath19 .",
    "mtf theory is an exact limit of quantum mechanics for @xmath20 while @xmath21 ; in this regime , sphericity of the atom is not destroyed @xcite .",
    "extending mtf theory to bulk matter under pressure , one repeats the above arguments , replacing the characteristic size of an isolated atom with the wigner - seitz radius @xmath22 , and finds that the validity conditions put a restriction on the number of flux quanta penetrating the unit cell : @xmath23 .    like orbital - free density functional theory in general ,",
    "the mtf model works with densities , not wavefunctions .",
    "wavefunctions are implicit in that the amplitude of the underlying wavefunction determines the density , but the phase is not directly expressed .",
    "therefore , the mtf model ca nt be expected to capture some implications of the phase structure of the underlying wavefunction , in particular , issues with periodicity - breaking in a strong magnetic field . while this argument helps justify use of periodic boundary conditions ( pbcs ) for arbitrary field configurations in the mtf model",
    ", we can also show that pbcs are exact for a large number of field configurations satisfying @xmath24 .",
    "consequently , the physical regime treated by the mtf model here is also amenable to wavefunction - based methods that require ( or are greatly simplified by ) pbcs , and which may be used to check the accuracy of mtf predictions .",
    "consider the single - electron hamiltonian @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is any lattice vector .",

    "now restrict the magnetic field orientation to be along an irreducible lattice vector @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",

    "choose @xmath32 as the primitive lattice vector @xmath34 .",
    "any valid choice of the remaining primitive vectors @xmath35 and @xmath36 gives flux @xmath37 through two elementary plaquettes ( an elementary plaquette is defined by @xmath38 ) and in the mtf regime , the flux through the third plaquette automatically satisfies @xmath39 . never is more than a small fractional adjustment of @xmath40 required for @xmath41 to be integer - valued through this third plaquette ; with this adjustment @xmath42 form a commuting set and may be simultaneously diagonalized by the bloch functions @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a magnetic subband index and @xmath45 has the periodicity of the primitive lattice .",
    "( for @xmath41 rational - valued through each elementary plaquette , @xmath45 is periodic over certain non - primitive cells ; for irrational flux , @xmath45 is incommensurate with @xmath46 ) .",
    "note that a change of basis takes the set of plaquette fluxes @xmath47 into a different set of integer fluxes while the actual field configuration remains unchanged .",
    "the mtf model for a degenerate electron gas in the lowest landau level interacting with a lattice of point nuclei is defined by the energy functional @xmath48 = e_{kin } + v_{ie } + v_{ee } , \\label{functional}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 one obtains the mtf equation by imposing the stationarity condition @xmath50 and combining the result with the poisson equation @xmath51 . while @xmath52 is the total electrostatic potential from electrons and nuclei , nuclear charge density is omitted from the right hand side of this poisson equation and instead taken into account via the boundary conditions @xmath53 as @xmath54 .",
    "it is convenient to make a change of variables defined by @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 .",
    "delaying further discussion of boundary conditions , we write down the startlingly concise pde which is the result of these manipulations : @xmath59 .",
    "to solve the model , we use an improved version of macfarlane & hubbard s domain decomposition method , hereafter imh .",
    "the original method features subdomain interfaces that are easy to implement ( boxes ) , but do nt respect the symmetry of the solution , and we have observed that this method generates large and unphysical discontinuities in @xmath60 near the box corners .",
    "use of curved interfaces is the main improvement in imh . noting the method can be generalized to any lattice , we restrict the present discussion to cubic bravais lattices , for which a convenient choice of domain @xmath61 is one octant of the conventional unit cell .",
    "subdomain @xmath62 is formed by centering a small sphere of radius @xmath63 on a lattice point , and taking the intersection with @xmath61 .",
    "there are @xmath64 identical copies of @xmath62 , one in each corner of @xmath61 where a nucleus is located ( two corners for bcc , four for fcc ) .",
    "a large  swiss cheese \" subdomain remains : @xmath65 .",
    "a change of variable @xmath66 in @xmath62 removes the singularity at the nucleus and gives the boundary conditions @xmath67 and @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is to be determined self - consistently .",
    "( in the case of uniform background , this quantity is equal to the madelung potential ) .",
    "imh is now written as a schwarz alternating procedure , with first half - step given by the initial value problem @xmath70 and second half - step given by the nonlinear boundary value problem @xmath71 in equation [ yprime ] , the @xmath72 derivative condition is obtained as a functional of the @xmath73 solution , extending the concept of  overlap \" in domain decompositions .",
    "information flow in imh is represented schematically in figure [ fig : flow](a ) .",
    "the integral over the primitive cell volume @xmath46 involves a product of the density nonuniformity correction and the ewald - type sum @xmath74 which can be obtained using a result due to @xcite .",
    "the madelung constant is given by @xmath75 ( bcc ) , @xmath76 ( fcc ) , while the wigner - seitz radius and lagrange multiplier ( fermi energy ) appear in dimensionless form @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "decoupled from imh is a normalization requirement @xmath79 which completes the description of model .",
    "since @xmath80 and @xmath81 only appear together as a ratio , for a given lattice the model is specified by three parameters : @xmath63 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the dirichlet radius @xmath63 has no physical significance , and we are interested in the limit @xmath84 , taken externally to the model ( @xmath85 essentially recovers the spherical wigner - seitz cell approximation ) . of the latter two parameters ,",
    "only one is independent , as the other must be adjusted to its normalizing value .",
    "once a converged , normalized solution is in hand , the @xmath86 helmholtz free energy per nucleus is found by an integration over the primitive cell @xmath87 . \\label{helmholtz}\\ ] ] this expression excludes the energy stored in the magnetic field , which is assumed to be constant in the following calculations .",
    "comparison with linear response theory , which involves expanding the current model to leading order in @xmath88 , is facilitated by noting that @xmath82 in the current model is simply related to the inverse screening length @xmath89 in the linear response theory @xmath90 for this reason we generally choose to fix @xmath82 and adjust @xmath83 in the normalization procedure .",
    "finally , we give a formula for obtaining @xmath82 from conventional units @xmath91",
    "starting with an initial guess @xmath92 corresponding to the uniform electron gas , the initial value problem ( equations [ ydoubleprime][yprime ] ) is integrated using a semi - implicit euler method with adaptive stepsize and built - in stability checks @xcite .",
    "having thus specified a dirichlet value for the boundary value problem , we solve equations [ pde][dirichlet ] by newton s iteration with initial guess @xmath93 . each linear system in newton s iteration is solved by the finite volume method ( fvm ) , through _ hypre s _ struct interface , using either @xmath94 or @xmath95 gridpoints .",
    "certain 7-point stencils are modified to implement the neumann and curved dirichlet boundaries using standard discretizations that preserve both the overall @xmath96 accuracy of the fvm scheme and the discrete maximum principle @xcite .",
    "each linear system is preconditioned by one v - cycle of _ hypre _ s smg multigrid and then iterated with conjugate gradients until the relative residual norm @xmath97 .",
    "this high tolerance is required for newton s iteration to converge to the same solution regardless of whether weighted jacobi or symmetric r / b gauss - seidel is used in the preconditioner .",
    "newton s iteration is terminated when the relative solution difference norm and relative nonlinear residual norm are both @xmath97 .",
    "integrations must then be performed to update the derivative condition @xmath98 . in @xmath99",
    ", we apply a low - order quadrature rule cell - wise over dual fvm cells , where the approximate solution is trilinear - accurate .",
    "exceptions are the dual cells cut by a curved boundary ; for @xmath100 there are @xmath101 of these .",
    "each cut cell is handled by simple monte carlo integration with a few thousand points , which gives sufficient accuracy without causing a bottleneck .",
    "we make use of _ hypre s _ internal ghost - zone updating routines for the dual cell - wise integration , and note this is a scalable approach .",
    "a high - order quadrature rule is used for the @xmath62 integration .",
    "iteration of imh proceeds as described , the only difference being that convergence is accelerated by using the initial guess @xmath102 for the @xmath72 newton s iteration . as a check",
    ", we also try @xmath103 and find no dependence on which of these initial guesses is used .",
    "imh is iterated until @xmath104 .",
    "while the limit @xmath84 is desired from a physical standpoint , it must be kept in mind that the dirichlet boundaries can be represented as smoothly curved surfaces within the structured grid only for @xmath105 .",
    "increasing @xmath63 increases the rate of information transfer from @xmath62 to @xmath99 , but it also decreases the rate of information transfer in the reverse direction , illustrated by figure [ fig : flow](b ) .",
    "we therefore restrict our study of @xmath63-dependence to the compromise range where @xmath106 goes from 0.08 to 0.32 . over this range",
    ", one can discern no discontinuity in @xmath60 at the interface , as occurs in the original macfarlane & hubbard method , and the smg - preconditioned solver yields consistent results .",
    "_ hypre s _ pfmg preconditioner also yields consistent results for the larger values of @xmath106 , and is much faster than smg .",
    "the elastic response of bcc and fcc lattices is obtained using small homogeneous strains @xmath107 . in neutron star conditions",
    ", one can not neglect hydrostatic pressure in a calculation of elastic constants @xmath108 if one hopes to obtain accurate wave propagation speeds . according to the standard work of @xcite @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the volume of the reference state subject only to hydrostatic pressure and no other strains , and the strain derivative",
    "is taken with respect to this reference state . in practice ,",
    "one choses a strain matrix that isolates the elastic response to a particular @xmath108 , or a specific combination of them , and there are many ways to do this .",
    "although one popular method @xcite employs certain volume - conserving strains such that the pressure correction term in equation [ cijkl ] vanishes , we use an alternative approach that keeps the numerical method as simple as possible .",
    "first we calculate @xmath111 from a uniaxial strain .",
    "the only modification to the numerical method is insertion of one or more extra layers of gridpoints at a height well away from any curved boundaries .",
    "next we calculate @xmath112 using a symmetric shear deformation , i.e. the only nonzero strain components are @xmath113 .",
    "this method is equivalent to that given by equations 2 - 3 in @xcite .",
    "shear deformation means the stencil , quadrature rule , domain and boundary conditions must all be modified , and owing to these complications we calculate @xmath114 for bcc only .",
    "our modified 7-point stencil has discretization in the shear plane accurate to order @xmath115 , and we are concerned only with values of @xmath116 .",
    "symmetry lowering makes it necessary to increase the size of the domain to half of the conventional cell , and replace neumann with periodic boundaries on surfaces normal to the shear plane . _",
    "hypre _ s smg solver has a power - of - two restriction on grid periods , so the sheared problems are computed using @xmath117 gridpoints .",
    "the remaining independent elastic constant @xmath118 is obtained from the single - crystal bulk modulus @xmath119 .",
    "cubic lattice stability requires that the born criteria are met : @xmath120 , @xmath114 , and @xmath121 must all be positive .",
    "elastic constants obtained in this manner contain no information about the lorentz force acting on nuclei during lattice vibrations . this can drastically change the phonon spectrum of a coulomb crystal ",
    "see @xcite section 4.1.6b for a review , and more recently , @xcite . at a semi - classical level",
    "we can expect the mtf solid to be less affected by this than the coulomb crystal , because the nuclei are strongly screened by charge - neutralizing electrons",
    ". the effect may still be significant , however . with this caveat ,",
    "we regard our prior calculation of elastic constants as a @xmath122 frozen phonon calculation , being , at present , less interested in the direct effect of the magnetic field on lattice vibrations than the indirect effect of the modified electron statistics .",
    "other studies @xcite have similarly neglected the distortion of the phonon spectrum by the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite have argued that this is justified at all but the strongest fields and lowest densities ( @xmath123 gauss and @xmath124 g / cc ) .",
    "characteristic phase velocities of long wavelength phonons are given by @xmath125 for longitudinal and transverse modes , respectively .",
    "in analysis of neutron star material , the effective shear modulus @xmath126 is typically taken to be the angle - averaged quantity proposed by @xcite  see for example @xcite . for cubic crystal symmetry , this takes the form @xmath127 debye frequencies for longitudinal and transverse phonons can now be defined as @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the debye wavenumber and @xmath130 is the number density of nuclei .",
    "these quantities are not meant to suggest that the debye model gives a good approximation to the actual phonon dispersion throughout the brillouin zone , or that @xmath131 is an accurate zone - edge frequency .",
    "rather , they are intended merely as a characterization of the @xmath122 phonon dispersion .    to address the question of zone edge phonon frequencies in the mtf model",
    ", we perform a separate frozen phonon calculation at the h - point of the bcc brillouin zone , where longitudinal and transverse branches coincide . to visualize the frozen h - mode , start with the bcc conventional cell and",
    "slightly displace the nucleus in the body - center position towards a face - center position . the domain and boundary conditions used for the @xmath114 calculation",
    "are conveniently recycled to treat this case ( setting @xmath132 ) .",
    "however , the ewald sum given by equation [ latsum ] , and associated madelung constant , must be generalized to a non - bravais lattice , as in @xcite . the squared h - mode frequency @xmath133 is given by the ratio of the frozen phonon spring constant to the reduced mass of the system of interpenetrating simple cubic sublattices .",
    "again , the effect of lorentz forces on nuclei is ignored .",
    "for comparison with the non - periodized model and linear response theory , calculations are performed with @xmath82 in the range 1 to 2 .",
    "an issue arises for @xmath134 , where an intermediate stage of newton s iteration generates an approximate solution @xmath135 that is not everywhere real .",
    "no results are presented in these cases .",
    "we first check that the asymptotic limits of @xmath83 and @xmath136 are consistent with the mtf  atom \" at zero pressure , and that the nonuniformity correction @xmath137 tends to zero in the high density limit , see figure [ fig : mtfuni ] .",
    "next we compute the equation of state and @xmath86 free energy difference between bcc and fcc structures , also shown in figure [ fig : mtfuni ] .",
    "the equation of state is very close to that obtained using spherical wigner - seitz cells , with a slight hardening at low density . at high density ,",
    "good agreement is also found with the linear response bcc - fcc energy difference , whereas at low density there is a notable departure towards favoring fcc .",
    "this is the first indication that the equilibrium phase diagram may be significantly different than that predicted by linear response of the lowest landau level electron gas .",
    "surprisingly , we find almost no dependence of these results on the dirichlet radius @xmath63 , over two doublings .",
    "( the bcc - fcc energy difference in particular should be a good test of @xmath63-dependence ) .",
    "we can thus be reasonably certain that the data shown represent the @xmath138 limit .",
    "next we calculate an exchange correction to the equation of state and bcc - fcc energy difference to zeroth order in @xmath139 , where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the self - consistent thomas - fermi - dirac and thomas - fermi densities . a local density approximation for the exchange energy of a strongly magnetized electron gas",
    "was first given by @xcite .",

    "this leading order term is sufficient and avoids the non - integrable divergence at the nuclei that one would get with higher order terms .",
    "results for the exchange correction are shown in figure [ fig : mtfd ] .",
    "for high field strengths and low densities , the exchange correction slightly softens the equation of state and further increases the energetic favorability of fcc .",
    "elastic constants are more sensitive to the dirichlet radius than are the static quantities so far considered .",
    "they also show some dependence on the strain magnitude . in the case of @xmath145 and @xmath146 ,",
    "these combined dependences are weak , amounting to variations on the order of @xmath147 over the range of dirichlet radius and strain magnitude studied . in the case of @xmath114 ,",
    "the dependencies are stronger ( see figure [ fig : c44 ] ) .",
    "we reiterate that @xmath138 is the desired limit for the 3d mtf model .",
    "fortunately , @xmath114 s spurious strain dependence tends to go away as this limit is approached and reasonably consistent results ( across different strain magnitudes ) are obtained at the smallest dirichlet radius ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : c44 ] also shows that the electron kinetic contribution to @xmath114 is in good agreement with the magnitude of the pressure correction @xmath149 , at high density .",
    "more will be said about this at the end of the section .",
    "our best - converged results for the @xmath150 , obtained at @xmath148 , are shown in figure [ fig : elastic ] , and the corresponding elastic moduli given in table [ tab : moduli ] . in table",
    "[ tab : moduli ] and for the remaining analysis , we take @xmath126 as the smoother of the two data series obtained at @xmath148 ( green crosses in the left panel of figure [ fig : elastic ] ) .",
    "remarkably similar elastic constants are found for bcc and fcc lattices . both lattices exhibit instabilities due to @xmath151 .",
    "since @xmath152 describes the response to a deformation involving a diagonal , zero - trace strain matrix , this suggests that the true equilibrium structure is either orthorhombic or tetragonal .",
    "this type of lattice instability also occurs in terrestrial metals : both cubic phases of the light actinides uranium and neptunium suffer from @xmath0 and adopt orthorhombic structures in equilibrium @xcite .",
    "we leave the search for the stable structure , i.e. mapping out bain transformation paths , for future work . if the cubic lattices are instead marginally stable , as the results at larger strain and/or larger @xmath63 suggest , they appear to be highly anisotropic in the sense @xmath153 .",
    "this is consistent with the coulomb crystal , which is elastically similar to lithium and plutonium @xcite .",
    "no @xmath154 or @xmath155 instabilities were found at any @xmath63 , although the latter criterion has been checked only for bcc .",
    "a consideration of soft modes associated with potential incipient lattice instabilities is interesting but beyond the scope of the present work .    .",
    "pressure , bulk modulus , and effective shear modulus of the bcc mtf solid , in units of @xmath156 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : moduli ]    longitudinal and transverse debye frequencies ( extrapolated from the brillouin zone center ) and h - mode frequency @xmath157",
    "are given in figure [ fig : thermal ] in units of the nuclear ( ion ) plasma frequency @xmath158 .",
    "as with the static lattice properties , @xmath157 was found to have negligible @xmath63-dependence .",
    "consistent results were also found across different frozen phonon amplitudes .",
    "the picture we have thus obtained of the transverse phonon dispersion in the nonlinear mtf model is the following : at @xmath122 , the dispersion is apparently 5 - 7 times stronger than in the unscreened coulomb crystal model ( compare the green triangles with the shaded green band in figure [ fig : thermal ] ) .",
    "this @xmath159 enhancement seemingly can not be explained by linear response screening corrections to the coulomb crystal model , because transverse phonons are largely insensitive to linear response screening , and the small correction obtained tends to decrease rather than increase @xmath159 @xcite . at the zone edge , however , the transverse phonon frequencies come in rather close to the coulomb crystal s debye frequency ( compare the orange squares with the shaded green band in figure [ fig : thermal ] ) .",
    "since we have only considered the zone center and zone edge , the wavenumber @xmath160 at which the spectrum begins to deviate strongly from a linear dispersion is not known .",
    "an upper limit is @xmath161 , since if the linear dispersion held farther from the center of the brillouin zone ( debye sphere ) , phonon frequencies would exceed @xmath162 . answering",
    "this question within the framework of the imh method would require inclusion of a large number of unit cells in the computational domain .    because our calculation of @xmath114 involves a volume change and the strongly magnetized , degenerate electron gas is much less compressible than the nonmagnetized gas ( due to its higher adiabatic index ) , it is important to confirm that the @xmath159 enhancement in the mtf solid is not an artifact of our particular choice of strain deformation .",
    "the helmholtz energy ( equation [ helmholtz ] ) can be decomposed into kinetic and electrostatic terms , so we similarly decompose @xmath163 ( where the pressure correction @xmath164 is given by the last term in equation [ cijkl ] ) .",
    "components @xmath165 and @xmath164 are both nonzero due to the volume change @xmath166 accompanying our shear deformation ; in contrast , they both vanish for the volume - conserving shear deformation given by equation 4 in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : mtfuni ] also shows that the total pressure @xmath167 entering into @xmath164 is , at high densities , dominated by the electron kinetic pressure .",
    "these observations suggest a correspondence between @xmath165 and @xmath164 . indeed , we find that these two quantities cancel almost completely at high densities ( see the right panel of figure [ fig : c44 ] ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath165 is several times smaller than @xmath168 in the appropriate limit of small dirichlet radius .",
    "thus we conclude that @xmath169 regardless of which strain deformation is used .",
    "we also would not expect @xmath168 to be significantly different in the volume - conserving method , since the only extra strain component involved in that case is to leading order the square of the symmetric shear strain component , meaning that for small strains the size and shape of the unit cell is very similar in the two methods .",
    "the comparable magnitudes of @xmath170 and @xmath159 in the mtf model may be unusual in the context of polarizable plasmas , but there are many examples of atomic solids where a similar situation occurs , and the mtf model is , after all , a crude description of an atomic solid in a huge magnetic field .",
    "enhancement of @xmath159 by a factor of 5 - 7 could have consequences for magnetized neutron star envelopes at @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is the ion plasma temperature .",
    "in this temperature regime , only the lowest - frequency acoustic phonons around @xmath122 are thermally occupied , and those of the mtf solid are substantially stiffer than those of the coulomb crystal .",
    "the sound speed is therefore much higher , while the number of thermally excited phonon modes available for thermal transport at a given temperature is much lower .",
    "the elastic instabilities we have found support mounting evidence that the crystal lattice structure of a neutron star crust is more complicated than heretofore assumed , across a range of depths and associated physical regimes @xcite . even the simple mtf model , which contains no explicit symmetry - breaking mechanism , can result in an equilibrium structure with unexpectedly low symmetry . aside from obvious thermodynamic signatures such as latent heat",
    ", a low - symmetry structure can couple to the magnetic field direction .",
    "if the coupling is strong , one can imagine the transition being driven by a changing field , or conversely , the transition exerting a back - action on the crustal field , which could have non - local effects . also , a @xmath0 driven transition could potentially be of a martensitic ( shape memory ) nature .    finally ,",
    "we suggest that the domain decomposition method described here could be extended to treat certain  pasta phases \" in neutron star cores , complementary to dimensional continuation techniques @xcite .",

    "<S> static and dynamic properties of low density outer envelopes of neutron stars are calculated within the nonlinear magnetic thomas - fermi model , assuming degenerate electrons . </S>",
    "<S> a novel domain decomposition enables proper description of lattice symmetry and may be seen as a prototype for the general class of problems involving nonlinear charge screening of periodic , quasi - low - dimensionality structures , e.g.  liquid crystals . </S>",
    "<S> we describe a scalable implementation of the method using _ hypre_. phase velocity of long wavelength transverse phonons is found to be a factor of 5 - 7 larger than in the corresponding coulomb crystal model , which could have implications for low temperature phonon - mediated thermal conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> other findings include @xmath0 elastic instabilities for both bcc and fcc lattices , reminiscent of the situation in some light actinides , and suggestive of a symmetry - lowering transition to a tetragonal or orthorhombic lattice . </S>"
