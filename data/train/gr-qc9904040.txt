    "inspiraling neutron star binaries are expected to be among the strongest sources of gravitational radiation that could be detected by the interferometric detectors currently under construction ( geo600 , ligo , tama and virgo ) .",
    "these binary systems are therefore subject to numerous theoretical studies . among them are ( i ) post - newtonian ( pn ) analytical treatments ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and ( ii ) fully relativistic hydrodynamical treatments , pioneered by the works of oohara and nakamura ( see e.g. @xcite ) and wilson et al . @xcite . the most recent numerical calculations , those of baumgarte et al . @xcite and marronetti et al .",
    "@xcite , rely on the approximations of ( i ) a quasiequilibrium state and ( ii ) of synchronized binaries . whereas the first approximation is well justified before the innermost stable orbit",
    ", the second one does not correspond to physical situations , since it has been shown that the gravitational - radiation driven evolution is too rapid for the viscous forces to synchronize the spin of each neutron star with the orbit @xcite as they do for ordinary stellar binaries .",
    "rather , the viscosity is negligible and the fluid velocity circulation ( with respect to some inertial frame ) is conserved in these systems .",
    "provided that the initial spins are not in the millisecond regime , this means that close binary configurations are better approximated by zero vorticity ( i.e. _ irrotational _ ) states than by synchronized states .",
    "dynamical calculations by wilson et al .",
    "@xcite indicate that the neutron stars may individually collapse into a black hole prior to merger .",
    "this unexpected result has been called into question by a number of authors ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a summary of all the criticisms and their answers ) .",
    "recently flanagan @xcite has found an error in the analytical formulation used by wilson et al .",
    ". this error may be responsible of the observed radial instability . as argued by mathews et al .",
    "@xcite , one way to settle this crucial point is to perform computations of relativistic irrotational configurations .",
    "we have performed recently such computations @xcite .",
    "they show no compression of the stars , although the central density decreases much less than in the corotating case . in the present report , we give more details about the results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and extend them to the compactification ratio @xmath2 ( the results of ref .",
    "@xcite have been obtained for a compactification ratio @xmath0 ) .",
    "we have proposed a relativistic formulation for quasiequilibrium irrotational binaries @xcite as a generalization of the newtonian formulation presented in ref .",
    "the method was based on one aspect of irrotational motion , namely the _ counter - rotation _ ( as measured in the co - orbiting frame ) of the fluid with respect to the orbital motion ( see also ref .",
    "since then , teukolsky  @xcite and shibata  @xcite gave two formulations based on the definition of irrotationality , which implies that the specific enthalpy times the fluid 4-velocity is the gradient of some scalar field @xcite ( _ potential flow _ ) .",
    "the three formulations are equivalent ; however the one given by teukolsky and by shibata greatly simplifies the problem .",
    "consequently we used it in the present work .",
    "the irrotational hypothesis amounts to say that the co - momentum density is the gradient of a potential @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the fluid specific enthalpy and fluid 4-velocity .    beside the physical assumption ( [ e : irrot ] ) , two simplifying approximations are introduced :    1 .",
    "the spacetime is supposed to have a helicoidal symmetry @xcite , which means that the orbits are exactly circular and that the gravitational radiation content of spacetime is neglected .",
    "the spatial 3-metric is assumed to be conformally flat ( wilson - mathews approximation @xcite ) , so that the full spacetime metric reads @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the flat space metric .",
    "the killing vector corresponding to hypothesis ( i ) is denoted by @xmath9 ( cf .",
    "[ f : helic ] ) .",
    "approximation ( i ) is physically well motivated , at least up to the innermost stable orbit . regarding the second approximation , it is to be noticed that ( i ) the 1-post newtonian ( pn ) approximation to einstein equations fits this form , ( ii ) it is exact for arbitrary relativistic spherical configurations and ( iii ) it is very accurate for axisymmetric rotating neutron stars @xcite .",
    "an interesting discussion about some justifications of the wilson - mathews approximation may be found in @xcite .",

( [ e : int_prem ] ) is not merely the relativistic generalization of the bernoulli theorem which states that @xmath31 is constant along each single streamline and which results directly from the existence of a killing vector without any hypothesis on the flow . in order for the constant to be uniform over the streamlines ( i.e. to be a constant over spacetime ) , as in eq .",
