    "one of the salient features of a gaseous bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) is the internal spin degrees of freedom . in spinor becs , namely , in becs with internal degrees of freedom , spin and gauge degrees of freedom couple in various manners , leading to nontrivial properties of spin waves and topological excitations .",
    "for example , ferromagnetic becs have continuous spin - gauge symmetry , thus the circulation of the superfluid velocity is not quantized  @xcite , whereas spin-1 polar becs and spin-2 cyclic becs can host fractional vortices due to the discrete spin - gauge symmetry  @xcite . in recent experiments , _ in situ _ imaging of transverse magnetization has revealed the real - time dynamics of the spontaneous symmetry breaking , spin texture formation , and nucleation of spin vortices  @xcite , opening up a new paradigm for studying the static and dynamic properties of spin textures .    on the other hand , becs with magnetic dipole - dipole interaction ( mddi )",
    "have also attracted much attention both experimentally and theoretically in recent years .",
    "the long - range and anisotropic nature of the mddi is predicted to yield exotic phenomena , such as new equilibrium shapes , roton - maxon spectra , supersolid states , and two - dimensional solitons  @xcite . in particular , when the bec has spin degrees of freedom , the mddi is predicted to develop spin textures , even when the mddi is much weaker than the contact interaction  @xcite .",
    "this work is motivated by experiments done by the berkeley group  @xcite , where small magnetic domains were observed to develop from a helical spin structure in a spin-1 @xmath0rb bec .",

    "the authors use a unit vector to describe the local magnetization in the ferromagnetic phase . here",
    "we use a single complex scalar variable instead of a unit vector to describe the local magnetization and treat both the spin - gauge coupling and mddi .",
