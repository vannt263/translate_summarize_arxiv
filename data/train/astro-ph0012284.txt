    "it is commonly assumed by astronomers that inflation predicts a scale - invariant ` harrison - zeldovich ' ( h - z ) spectrum of scalar density perturbations , @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "adams et al .",
    "( 1997 ) realized that the spectrum may not be even _ scale - free _ because the rapid cooling of the universe during primordial inflation can result in spontaneous symmetry breaking phase transitions which may interrupt the slow roll of the inflaton field for brief periods .",
    "this is in fact inevitable in models based on @xmath4 supergravity , the phenomenologically successful extension of the standard model of particle physics and the effective field theory below the planck scale . during inflation , the large vacuum energy breaks ( global )",
    "supersymmetry giving otherwise massless fields ( ` flat directions ' ) a mass of order the hubble parameter @xcite , causing them to evolve rapidly to the asymmetric global minima of their scalar potential .",
    "such ` intermediate scale ' fields are generic in models derived from superstring / m - theory and have gauge and yukawa couplings to the thermal plasma so are initially confined at the symmetric maxima of their scalar potentials .",
    "consequently it takes a ( calculable ) finite amount of cooling before the thermal barrier disappears and they are free to evolve to their minima @xcite . when a symmetry breaking transition occurs , the mass of the inflaton field changes suddenly ( through couplings in the khler potential ) , temporarily violating the slow - roll conditions and interrupting inflation ( adams et al .",
    "thus the density perturbation is expected to have a ( near ) h - z spectrum for the first @xmath5 e - folds of expansion followed by one or more sudden departures from scale - invariance lasting @xmath6 e - fold . in order for such spectral features to be observable in the lss or cmb , it is of course necessary that they occur within the last @xmath7 e - folds of inflation , corresponding to spatial scales going up to the present hubble radius @xmath8 .",
    "since the density perturbation can be observed on scales from the hubble radius down to @xmath9 , corresponding to about 8 e - folds of expansion , it would be not unreasonable to expect at least one such spectral break to be seen today .",
    "there are several arguments ( reviewed in the appendix of @xcite ) that on scales @xmath10 , which are at most weakly non - linear , the apm galaxy power spectrum @xmath11 @xcite is an _ unbiased _ ( or moderately linearly biased ) tracer of the mass .",
    "the linear power spectrum recovered under this assumption from @xmath11 is well fitted in this range by @xcite:@xmath12^{1.6}}$ ] where @xmath13 . here",
    "we will also use the common convention : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the primordial spectrum of matter fluctuations and @xmath16 is the ( dimensionful ) normalisation constant . from the expressions above we estimate @xmath15 to be : @xmath17^{1.6 } } , & \\mbox{$k_1 \\leq k \\leq k_2$,}\\\\    a_2 k , & \\mbox{$k_2<k$ , } \\end{array } \\right .",

    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the recovered primordial spectrum ( [ pkprim ] ) for two choices of @xmath30 corresponding to the scdm model ( @xmath31 ) and a low density variant .",
    "note that the @xmath32 reconstruction has significantly less power than a scale - free h - z spectrum on scales @xmath33 , while the @xmath34 reconstruction is closer to a h - z spectrum but has relatively more power .",
    "thus the latter possibility does _ not _ give a good fit to the boomerang / maxima data with the value ( given above ) of the baryon density from big bang nucleosynthesis ( the reader is referred to @xcite for further comments on this ) .",

    "however a robust expectation is that @xmath41 because the field undergoing the symmetry - breaking phase transition evolves exponentially fast to its minimum .",
    "the ratio of the amplitudes @xmath42 is determined by the ( unknown ) superpotential couplings of the field undergoing the phase transition but is expected to exceed unity ( i.e. there is a decrease in the power ) .",

    "the tabulated values are smaller than the values we would obtain when using a h - z primordial spectrum , since the @xmath27 values for these cosmological models are quite high which , according to the apm data ( see figure 1 ) , implies a decrease power for the relevant scales . in figure [ fig8 ]",
