    "the scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) technique by use of scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) has become important for studies of low temperature physics in recent years .",
    "the sts is a powerful method to investigate local electronic density of states ( ldos ) of material surfaces with high spatial ( @xmath0 nm ) and energy resolutions ( @xmath1 mev ) at cryogenic temperature below 10 k. potentially , there are many applications in that temperature range , for example , unconventional superconductors with low transition temperatures ( @xmath2 ) , quantum nanostructures on semiconductor surfaces , @xmath3 . in principle",
    ", we can expect better performance of sts at lower temperatures because of smaller thermal broadenings of tunnel spectra and thermal expansion coefficients of materials .",
    "so far , several stms that work at sub - kelvin temperatures have been constructed ; for example , @xmath4he refrigerator based stms ( @xmath5 k ) @xcite and dilution refrigerator ( dr ) based stms ( @xmath6 k ) @xcite .",
    "however , due to technical difficulties , none of the existing dr - based stms has the _ full _ ultrahigh vacuum ( uhv ) compatibility with which one can prepare clean sample surfaces _ in situ_. in other words , samples are limited only to cleavable materials or those with chemically inert surfaces for so far constructed stms based on dr .    in this article",
    ", we describe details of design , construction and test results of a versatile ultra - low temperature stm ( ult - stm ) which we have constructed recently @xcite .",
    "it works at triple extreme conditions , @xmath7 , at very low temperatures down to 30 mk , in high magnetic fields up to 6 t and in uhv .",
    "it has also the following unique features : one can ( 1 ) prepare clean sample surfaces in a uhv chamber , ( 2 ) load the samples and tips to an stm head keeping low temperature and uhv conditions , and then ( 3 ) cool them back to near the base temperature within 3 hours .",
    "therefore , the ult - stm has a variety of applications without being restricted only to cleavable materials such as layered ones bound by the van der waals force .",
    "it has been successfully used , for example , in sts measurements of landau quantization in two - dimensional electron systems at surfaces of semiconductors @xcite and graphites @xcite and of surface electronic states in a spin - triplet superconductor sr@xmath8ruo@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "for sample / tip exchange , we adopted the bottom - loading mechanism , instead of the ordinary top - loading one because of the following technical reasons .",
    "( 1 ) one can shorten the access length for a sample / tip transfer rod .",
    "( 2 ) a specially designed dr with a large - bore central access for top - loading is not necessary .",
    "uhv chambers for sample / tip preparations and evaluations are located on floor of an experimental pit of 1.5 m deep .",
    "the cryostat is hung from an anti - vibration table and connected with the uhv chambers at the bottom ( fig .",
    "[ overview ] ) .",
    "the central part of the cryostat is a commercial dr @xcite with a super - insulated dewar .",
    "the volume of liquid helium reservoir ( 74 liters ) is large enough to maintain the base temperature for almost 3 days without refilling liquid helium .",
    "a 6 t superconducting magnet with a 90 mm bore diameter is immersed in the liquid - helium bath and surrounds a uhv can ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "all electronic equipments such as a current preamplifier @xcite and a controller @xcite for stm measurement are located in an rf - shielded box / room in order to eliminate electrical noises from outside .",
    "overview of the ult - stm .",
    "the thick arrows denote the loading path of samples and tips . ]",
    "central part of the cryostat .",
    "the stm head is located in the uhv space separated from the vacuum space for dr ( light grey region ) . ]",
    "a photo and a cross - sectional view of the stm head @xcite are shown in fig .  [ stmhead ] .",
    "the main body of the head is made of hard silver ( ag(@xmath10 99 at.%)+cd ( @xmath11 1 at.% ) ) and silicon silver ( ag@xmath12si@xmath13 ) rather than copper or copper - based alloys to prevent large nuclear - spin heat capacities in high magnetic fields at very low temperatures .",
    "these silver - based alloys have better mechanical strength compared to pure metals and proper thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a sample stage , sample holder and tip holder are made of high purity copper for better thermalization and moderate mechanical strength .",
    "they are thermally linked to the mixing chamber ( mc ) of dr through annealed silver foils and wires ( see next section ) .",
    "the coarse approach of tip towards sample surface ( z - coarse approach ) is obtained by the _ stick and slip _ motion with piezo actuators .",
    "two of the actuators hold an inner ceramic tube , which contains a single - tube piezo scanner , on three sides of the triangular cross - section .",
    "the speed of z - coarse approach is 60 @xmath14 m/s with an application of pulses of @xmath15150 v at 0.5 khz at temperatures below 4 k.    the tip holder is fixed to one end of the piezo scanner with an m3 screw .",
    "the maximum xy scan area of the scanner is 1.5@xmath161.5 @xmath14m@xmath17 below 4 k , while 4.5@xmath164.5 @xmath14m@xmath17 at room temperature .",
    "the sample holder is also screwed into the sample stage with m12 .",
    "samples are glued onto the sample holder with silver epoxy . for thermometry",
    ", a ruo@xmath8 chip - resistor is attached to the sidewall of sample stage .",
    "photo ( left ) and cross sectional drawing ( right ) of the stm head . ]",
    "the uhv space for the stm head is separated from the vacuum space for dr .",
    "therefore , the inner vacuum can ( ivc ) is made of thin - wall stainless steel tubes ( 0.5 mm thick ) and welded bellows ( 0.12 mm thick ) to reduce heat conduction from one end at 4 k to another at the base temperature ( see fig .  [ cryostat ] ) .",
    "the stm head is rigidly supported from the bottom of the ivc and thermally connected to the mc with three support rods made of copper ( 8 mm in diameter and 168 mm long ) .",
    "the stm head is surrounded by a copper radiation shield with a demountable bottom cap which is thermally anchored to the mc .",
    "the sample and tip are thermally anchored independently to the mc with additional well - annealed high - purity silver thin - foils and -wires .",
    "mylar sheets ( 25 @xmath14 m thick ) are inserted between the sample stage / tip holder and the silver thermal links for electrical isolation .    in order to minimize the access length for bottom loading",
    ", we made a specially designed attachment ( _ thermal isolation tail _ ) which separates the uhv space from the vacuum space for the dewar inside the outer vacuum can ( ovc ) ( see fig .",
    "[ cryostat ] ) .",
    "the thermal isolation tail consists of three coaxial cylinders to minimize heat leaks from higher temperature sides .",
    "several parts of the inner and outer cylinders are made of thin - wall stainless - steel tubes ( 0.5 mm thick ) and flexible tubes ( 0.15 mm thick ) .",
    "the middle cylinder made of copper is thermally anchored to the neck of the dewar ( @xmath18 k ) . between the cylinders , 3050 layers of aluminized mylar sheets ( super - insulation )",
    "are inserted for radiation shielding .",
    "two demountable baffles thermally anchored to 5 k and 80 k shield radiation through the access line from the bottom .    to reduce heat leaks through electrical lead wires , we used two different kinds of wires in the ivc ; a co - axial cable ( inner conductor : superconducting nbti wire of 0.1 mm in diameter , outer conductor : cuni tube of 0.6 mm in diameter ) for tunnel current detection or the bias voltage application and superconducting nbti twisted - wires ( each 0.10 mm in diameter ) for the high voltage application to the piezo actuators . in the uhv space ,",
    "all the wires are converted to insulated copper twisted - wires which are thermally anchored to the mc .      the uhv chamber @xcite consists of three parts : ( 1 ) load - lock chamber , ( 2 ) preparation / analysis chamber , and ( 3 ) precooling chamber ( see fig .  [ overview ] ) .",
    "the actual procedure of sample / tip preparation is as follows . at first",
    "we introduce a new sample or tip into the load - lock chamber and evacuate it below 10@xmath19 pa by a turbo molecular pump .",
    "the tip can be cleaned by electron beam heating , if necessary .",
    "then it is transferred to the preparation / analysis chamber with a magnetic transfer rod .",
    "we can prepare a clean sample surface here by resistive heating and/or argon ion sputtering in a uhv environment ( @xmath20 pa ) achieved with an ion pump and a titanium sublimation pump ( 1600 @xmath21 ) .",
    "the surface quality can be analyzed by low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) .",
    "after the surface preparation , the sample / tip is transferred to a copper platform in the precooling chamber .",
    "here it is cooled by liquid nitrogen or liquid helium flow down to 100 k or 7 k , respectively .",
    "the sample cleavage can be done at various temperatures between 7 and 300 k by pushing a small post glued on top of the sample with a blade in this chamber .",
    "finally , the precooled sample / tip is transferred to the stm head .",
    "the whole cryostat is suspended from the anti - vibration table with air springs , dampers ( vertical direction ) and rubber stacks ( horizontal direction ) .",
    "mechanical resonance frequencies of this system are 1.5 hz in the vertical and 2.0/2.5 hz in the horizontal directions , respectively .",
    "four support pillars of the table are filled with sand for vibration damping .",
    "vibrational and acoustic noises generated by vacuum pumps for dr operation are eliminated by installing them on a rigid frame with rubber springs and dampers in an acoustic shielded box .",
    "soft bellows are inserted in pumping lines near the top of the cryostat .",
    "especially , t - shaped bellows are used for the still pumping line ( 76 mm in diameter ) of dr . to increase the rigidity of the dr unit in the ivc",
    ", we inserted additional thermal isolation supports between different temperature stages below the 1 k pot .",
    "figure [ tipchange ] shows time evolutions of temperatures of the precooling stage and stm head during the sample / tip exchange procedure . before inserting the sample / tip",
    ", we first stop the @xmath4he circulation of dr .",
    "although the stm head is warmed temporarily up to about 10 k by the insertion , it quickly cools back to 2 k due to a large heat capacity of @xmath4he@xmath22he mixture liquid in the dr unit . by restarting the @xmath4he circulation",
    ", it cools back below 70 mk in only 1.5 hours .",
    "it takes about 15 hours more to reach the lowest temperature below 30 mk . the quick turnaround back to near",
    "the base temperature within 3 hours in total is one of extraordinary features of this ult - stm .",
    "time evolutions of temperatures of the precooling stage and stm head during the sample / tip exchange procedure . ]      to demonstrate the basic performance of ult - stm , we carried out test measurements using a 2h - nbse@xmath8 sample .",
