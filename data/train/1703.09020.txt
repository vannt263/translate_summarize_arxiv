    "cosmological inflation plays an essential role in addressing various cosmological issues  @xcite as well as generating the primordial perturbations  @xcite .",
    "although the idea of inflation leads to a successful picture in modern cosmology , the underlying particle physics is still unclear . among various possibilities ,",
    "one of the most attractive scenarios is extending the gravity sector .",
    "the starobinsky inflation  @xcite is one of the most successful models along this line , and the higgs inflation  @xcite , in which a nonminimal coupling between the higgs field and the ricci scalar is introduced , has also persisted to date .    over the past few years",
    ", our understanding on the behavior of these inflation models has been significantly developed : the discovery of attractor .",
    "it has been found that a large class of models with a general form of nonminimal coupling to gravity , including the higgs inflation , has similar inflationary predictions .",
    "generalization of such models has been made (  universal attractor \"  @xcite or  induced inflation \"  @xcite ) , and their attractor behavior is now called  @xmath0-attractor \"  @xcite . on the other hand , the recently proposed  @xmath1-attractor \"  @xcite has revealed a generic feature of attractors appearing in the models with a kinetic pole , which coincide with @xmath0-attractor with a certain choice of model parameters  @xcite .    in this _ letter _ , we revisit inflation models with the nonminimal coupling .",
    "we first propose a new class of models which is featured by the climbing of the inflaton up the potential hill by considering a specific behavior of the nonminimal coupling .",
    "we point out that this class of models has attractor behavior , and discuss its relation with known attractors in a general way .",
    "then we give a concrete example of such models using the natural inflation - type potential  @xcite with a nonminimal coupling , and show that the inflationary predictions come well within the region consistent with planck observation  @xcite .",
    "we also point out that our setup can be applied to a broad class of inflaton potentials which have multiple degenerate vacua .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hillclimbinggeneral ] we give general discussion on the attractor behavior in inflation models with the nonminimal coupling . in sec .",

    "we finally conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "let us start with general discussion on attractor solutions in inflation models with the nonminimal coupling .",
    "throughout the paper , we focus on the following single - field inflation setup : @xmath2 , \\label{eq : sj}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the reduced planck mass , and @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the ( jordan - frame ) inflaton , ricci scalar and potential , respectively .",
    "hereafter the subscript @xmath7 indicates the `` jordan frame '' .",
    "also , the factor @xmath8 in front of the kinetic term @xmath9 is an arbitrary function of @xmath4 , which we retain for generality of the following argument .",
    "in addition , @xmath10 is an arbitrary function which takes positive values in the case of our interest . under the weyl rescaling @xmath11 ,",
    "the ricci scalar transforms as @xmath12 \\label{eq : r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with which the action ( [ eq : sj ] ) becomes @xmath13 , \\label{eq : se}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the potential is given by @xmath14 , and @xmath15 here let us suppose that the second term dominates the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ke ] ) .",
    "such a setup occurs _",
    "e.g. _ when @xmath16 for @xmath17 or when @xmath18 .",
    "then the kinetic term in the action ( [ eq : se ] ) reduces to  @xcite @xmath19 now let us assume that @xmath20 evolves from @xmath21 to @xmath22 during inflation . in the present universe without loss of generality . ]",
    "if we take @xmath23 with @xmath24 being a constant which determines the potential height at @xmath21 , this potential realizes a plateau for @xmath21 and a vanishing cosmological constant in the present universe . in terms of the einstein - frame inflaton",
    ", one may identify @xmath25 to make the kinetic term canonical , and then the potential becomes @xmath26 this potential realizes the spectral index @xmath27 and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath28 , @xmath29 in large-@xmath30 limit with @xmath30 being the @xmath31-folding number .",
    "it is known that a large class of inflation models predicts eq .",
    "( [ eq : nsrxi ] ) , which includes the higgs inflation @xmath32  @xcite and its generalizations such as  universal attractor \" @xmath33  @xcite or  induced inflation \" @xmath34  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the class of models which have this attractor behavior in the inflationary predictions ( [ eq : nsrxi ] ) have been dubbed as  @xmath0-attractor \" .      here",
    "we take a closer look at the arguments in the previous subsection . in discussing @xmath0-attractor ,",
    "we have assumed that the inflationary regime occurs at @xmath21 . in this _ letter _",
    ", in contrast , we consider    * inflation at @xmath36 .",
    "this distinction is important from a model - building point of view , as we see in the rest of this subsection and also in the next section with a concrete example .    to investigate the properties of such inflation models ,",
    "let us first consider the requirements to realize a vanishing cosmological constant in the present universe .",
    "assuming that @xmath20 is monotonic for the inflaton values of our interest , we write down the potential in terms of @xmath20 : @xmath37 with @xmath38 being some constants and @xmath39 being the leading exponent of @xmath20 which dominantly affects the inflationary predictions . note that we have not included negative powers of @xmath20 , in order to keep the flatness of the potential .",
    "the vanishing cosmological constant is realized by the same line of argument is possible for @xmath21 as well .",
    "one may write down the potential as @xmath40 with @xmath41 being some constants and @xmath42 being the leading exponent . here",
    "we have not included positive powers of @xmath20 because such terms spoil the flatness of the potential for @xmath21 .",

    "@xmath45 the slow - roll parameters @xmath46 and @xmath35 are given by @xmath47 where we respectively define @xmath48 and @xmath49 as @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and thus the inflaton rolls slowly when @xmath20 becomes sufficiently small .",
    "the attractor behavior of the inflationary predictions with the potential ( [ eq : veeta ] ) can be calculated as @xmath52 in large-@xmath30 limit .",
    "it should be noted that the resultant @xmath28 is different from eq .",

    "( [ eq : nsreta ] ) by adopting a similar expansion to the potential ( see footnote  [ fn : xiexpand]).-attractor has been made by setting @xmath53 where @xmath54 can be other than unity .",

    "[ sec : hillclimbingexample ] , this class of inflation models realizes @xmath55 easily , and therefore we distinguish them from @xmath0-attractor by calling them  @xmath35-attractor \" in the following .",
    "there is another important reason to distinguish between @xmath0- and @xmath35-attractors : application to existing inflaton potentials . to see this ,",
    "let us consider the inflaton behavior in the jordan frame .",
    "the jordan - frame potential is given by @xmath56 during inflation .",
    "this means that , in the class of inflation models which is featured by @xmath36 , the inflaton _ climbs up the potential hill _ due to a gravity effect .",
    "if one considers applying such a gravity effect to existing inflaton potentials , one sees that the existence of @xmath35-attractor can help the predictions of inflation models with multiple potential minima by modifying the inflaton behavior .",
    "we call such inflation models with @xmath35-attractor behavior _ hillclimbing inflation _ in the rest of the _ letter_. we will illustrate this point in sec .",
    "[ sec : hillclimbingexample ] with a concrete example .    before moving on to the next topic ,",

    "while they are based on a specific type of inflation models , we stress that this class of inflation can be seen in a rather broader range of models having multiple vacua in the inflaton potential , as we see in the next section .      here",
    "we comment on the relation with @xmath1-attractor , which was discovered in the studies of superfonformal inflation  @xcite and later developed to the current form  @xcite .",
    "its action is given by  @xcite @xmath58 with non - negative potential @xmath59 .",

    "canonical normalization of the inflation field @xmath61 leads to @xmath62 the potential can generically be expanded as @xmath63 with @xmath64 being some constants and @xmath42 being the leading exponent as in the previous subsections . though usually @xmath65 is assumed in calculating inflationary predictions in this class of models  @xcite , which holds true for _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath66 , we do not restrict ourselves to such a special case .",
    "the inflationary predictions for the potential ( [ eq : veexpandalpha ] ) approach @xmath67 in large-@xmath30 limit .",
    "the correspondence between @xmath0- or @xmath35-attractors and @xmath1-attractor is easily seen if one notice that the pole structure and the leading exponent dominantly determine the inflationary predictions  @xcite : @xmath1-attractor , whose action is given by eqs .",

    "we have studied their attractor behavior and investigated its relation with known attractors , and as a result , we have proposed  @xmath35-attractor \" .",
    "we have also discussed a possible realization of this type of models with the natural inflation potential , and shown that the inflationary predictions are affected by the existence of the attractor .",
    "though in this _ letter _ we have restricted ourselves to an example with the natural inflation , our discussion is also applicable to various types of models which have multiple vacua with vanishing vacuum energy . for example , it would be interesting to investigate the possibility of realizing the hillclimbing inflation when the sm higgs has another degenerate vacuum around @xmath98  gev , as suggested by the multiple - point principle  @xcite . as another interesting possibility , the hillclimbing inflation would take place even if the inflaton potential in the jordan frame is not bounded from below as long as the conformal factor becomes sufficiently small at a certain relevant scale .",
