    "spontaneous imbibition , namely the rise of a liquid in a capillary tube and more generally in a porous solid , is a ubiquitous phenomenon that has received a lot of attention over the years because of its crucial importance in many industrial processes ( oil recovery , ink printing , textile dyeing , etc ... ) as well as in agriculture and biological sciences . in spite of the complexity of real porous media ( in particular their disordered structure@xcite )",
    ", it is often observed that the distance of penetration of the liquid inside the solid increases asymptotically as the square root of time , as predicted by the classical lucas - washburn ( lw ) equation@xcite that describes the fluid behavior in a single capillary . on the macroscopic scale ,",
    "the @xmath0 law results from the balance between a constant capillary driving force due to the pressure drop across the liquid / vapor meniscus and an increasing viscous drag . in recent years , in relation to the rapid development of nanofluidic devices , the applicability of these macroscopic concepts in strongly confined geometries has attracted much interest , on both the experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite sides .",
    "the main conclusion of these studies is that the lw equation still works in capillaries with diameters of a few molecular sizes , the prediction being almost quantitative in the case of a simple lennard - jones fluid@xcite .",
    "this is quite remarkable as the continuum hydrodynamic description of the fluid is expected to break down at very small length scales .    in the case of complete wetting , molecular dynamics ( md ) and lattice - boltzmann simulations@xcite",
    "have also reported the presence of microscopic films moving ahead of the main capillary front and following also a @xmath0 law , but with a different prefactor than that of the main front .",
    "such precursor films are commonly observed in spreading droplet experiments and several theoretical models have been proposed to reproduce their diffusive behavior@xcite . in the case of imbibition",
    ", wetting films can significantly affect the dynamics of the gas - liquid interface@xcite and it is generally expected that they reduce the viscous drag , which of course is a crucial issue in microfluidics .",
    "some aspects of the problem , however , are not as well understood and deserve more systematic investigations .",
    "in particular , one would like to better understand the experimental conditions required for the appearance of the films , the influence of the solid wettability on their behavior , and how they compete with the meniscus for the liquid coming from the reservoir .",
    "these are complex issues , due to the coupling of hydrodynamic and non - hydrodynamic modes in the vicinity of the contact line .",
    "ideally , a theoretical study should require a full atomistic description of the system , but the very different length scales involved in the problem make it computationally very demanding .",
    "an important simplification consists in adopting a coarse - grained ( or mesoscopic ) lattice - gas description , as is done in the lattice - boltzmann method which indeed appears as an efficient tool for modelling capillary filling@xcite . in the present work , we further simplify the problem by treating the dynamical evolution of the fluid in configurational space only , the effect of the hydrodynamic modes being simply incorporated in effective parameters : only diffusionlike mechanisms are explicitly included .",
    "this minimal model , however , does account for liquid conservation which is the key ingredient at the origin of the constant slowing down of the imbibition front .",
    "a similar approach underlies the recent phase - field models of imbibition in disordered porous solids@xcite .",
    "the study of such systems is the next step on our agenda@xcite , and its theoretical treatment indeed requires the above simplifications . here",
    ", we describe spontaneous imbibition in a slit - pore by using a dynamic ( lattice ) mean - field theory ( dmft ) which is essentially the mean - field version of the kawasaki spin exchange dynamics .",
    "this theory is consistent with the treatment of thermodynamics at the mean - field level and it has already proven useful to model the dynamics of adsorption / desorption phenomena in nanopores@xcite .",
    "although we shall mainly consider the case of primary imbibition , when a liquid invades a dry capillary and precursor films appear in the complete wetting regime ( which is the situation considered in the recent simulation studies@xcite ) , we shall also briefly investigate the case where the liquid advances over pre - existing thin films ( prewetted capillary ) which is encountered in many actual situations , in particular in experiments with nanoporous solids@xcite .",

    "periodic boundary conditions are applied in the @xmath5 direction . the liquid reservoir ( in blue )",
    "is located at the left side of the pore.,width=340 ]    we consider the case of a slit pore schematically represented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . before describing the dynamic mean - field approach ,",
    "we first briefly recall the macroscopic description that leads to the lw @xmath6 law . as pointed out in the introduction , the dynamics of spontaneous imbibition under steady conditions ( and neglecting evaporation , gravity , and inertial effects@xcite )",
    "is governed by the balance between the capillary driving force due to the laplace pressure across the liquid / gas meniscus and the viscous drag of the liquid . in a slit geometry",
    "the meniscus is cylindrical and the laplace pressure is given by @xmath7 where @xmath3 is the width of the slit , @xmath8 is the surface tension of the liquid - gas interface and @xmath9 is the contact angle between the liquid and the solid walls ( assuming that in the long - time limit one can replace the dynamic contact angle by its static value ) . for an incompressible fluid ,",
    "this gives rise to a constant gradient pressure over the whole imbibed region , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the position of the meniscus inside the pore at time @xmath12 ( neglecting the internal structure of the interface ) .",
    "for a parabolic fluid - velocity profile normal to the walls ( hagen - poiseuille laminar flow ) , the viscous drag implies that the average velocity of the front is proportional to @xmath13 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the fluid viscosity and @xmath16 is the pore permeability .",
    "this leads to the differential equation @xmath17 which after integration gives @xmath18 the progression of the liquid inside the pore is thus described by a diffusive law with an effective diffusion coefficient that scales like the pore width .",
    "since the viscous drag is smaller in larger pores , the liquid progresses faster , as indeed observed experimentally .",
    "our presentation of dmft closely follows that of refs.@xcite and we refer the reader to these recent papers for more details ( see also ref . @xcite and the comprehensive review@xcite ) .",
    "this mean - field version of the kawasaki spin exchange model was first applied to the study of phase separation and surface enrichment in solid binary alloys@xcite . more generally , it is appropriate to describe systems with a diffusionlike behavior .",
    "the fluid inside the pore is modeled as a simple cubic lattice gas with hamiltonian @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the occupancy variable at site @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) and the first sum runs over all nearest - neighbor pairs associated with fluid sites while the second sum runs over the fluid sites within the layers adjacent to the two walls ( the pore walls being aligned with the @xmath23 planes of the cubic lattice ) ; @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the nearest - neighbor fluid - fluid and solid - fluid attractive interactions , respectively , and the wettability of the pore walls is thus controlled by the parameter @xmath26 .",
    "the corresponding bulk lattice gas has a symmetric coexistence curve @xmath27 with chemical potential @xmath28 , independent of temperature t.    this type of lattice - gas model has been extensively used in the literature to study adsorption phenomena and phase transitions on substrates and in confined geometry ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . here , for simplicity",
    ", the effect of the solid is felt only in the layers immediately adjacent to the pore walls , as in the recent applications of dmft to capillary condensation and evaporation@xcite .",
    "this is of course a simplification of the actual physical situation , where one typically has a long - ranged van der waals interaction which decays as a power - law with the distance from the surface@xcite .",
    "note also that we do not include any effect of surface corrugation in our calculation , although they may play an important role at low temperature .",
    "these two effects can be introduced in the theoretical treatment at the price of increasing numerical complexity . in the present set - up",
    ", the system is homogeneous in the @xmath5 direction parallel to the walls and is effectively two - dimensional .    within the master equation approach@xcite",
    ", one can write down an exact equation for the temporal evolution of the mean site occupancy variable@xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the probability to find the occupancy configuration @xmath31 at time @xmath12 . assuming that the transport is due to a hopping process between nearest - neighbor sites corresponding to a kawasaki exchange dynamics",
    ", this evolution equation can be written as @xmath32 where the summation runs over nearest neighbors of site @xmath21 and the flux @xmath33 from site @xmath21 to site @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 with @xmath36 the transition probability for transitions from site @xmath21 to site @xmath34 for a configuration @xmath31 . through the monte carlo method with metropolis transition probabilities",
    ", one could obtain an explicit realization of this dynamical process . in the dmft ,",
    "one instead uses a mean - field approximation and merely replaces the occupancy variables by their ensemble average ( which amounts in particular to assuming that the occupancy variables are dynamically uncorrelated ) .",
    "this yields @xmath37 and the evolution equation for the site densities becomes @xmath38\\ ] ] with transition probabilities @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 the parameter @xmath42 is an elementary jump rate which sets the time scale .",
    "we take the same @xmath42 for the  bulk \" sites and the  surface \" sites adjacent to the pore walls , thereby implying that the diffusion coefficient for a single molecule does not depend on the solid - fluid interaction , which is an additional approximation@xcite .",
    "the above dynamics could also be interpreted as resulting from a coarse - grained approximation of the full hydrodynamic treatment .",
    "in such an interpretation , the parameter @xmath42 incorporates in an effective way some average information about the hydrodynamic modes and could for instance be taken as proportional to the ratio of the permeability to the viscosity @xmath43 , with an explicit dependence on the pore width @xmath3 ( see above ) .",
    "however , in what follows , we neglect such remains of the hydrodynamic treatment and consider @xmath42 as independent of @xmath3 .",
    "( as a result , we do not expect to recover the proper trend for the front velocity as a function of the pore width and shall not study this aspect of the problem . )    as discussed in refs.@xcite , eq .",
    "( [ evol ] ) may be recast into the discrete version of a cahn - hilliard@xcite or dynamic density functional theory@xcite equation .",
    "the characteristic feature of the dmft is that the mobility coefficient has an explicit expression and is related to the local site densities via the metropolis transition probabilities .",
    "it is also worth noting that a coarse - grained continuity equation with a current @xmath44 proportional to the gradient of a chemical potential ( _ i.e. _ a generalized cahn - hilliard equation with a ginzburg- landau type free energy ) is at the core of the phase - field models that have been developed recently for studying spontaneous and forced - flow imbibition in disordered porous solids@xcite . in such a continuum ( mesoscopic ) approach , the dry and wetted states are considered as two  phases \" of the system ( @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the locally conserved field ) and the influence of disorder on the capillary force and the viscous drag are included in a locally random , but concentration - independent , mobility .",
    "hydrodynamic effects are thus hidden in this effective quantity .",
    "an important feature of the dmft , which will allow us to make a connection between the properties of the solution of the evolution equation and the adsorption isotherms in the same system , is that the site densities obtained from the minimization of the _ static _ helmholtz free energy @xmath47 $ ] in the canonical ensemble ( or from the minimization of the grand - potential @xmath48 in the grand canonical ensemble ) are steady - state solutions of eq .",

    "this value was small enough to ensure the stability of the solution in all cases and it actually corresponds to a very small variation of the site densities ( which leads to a serious technical problem and makes the numerical calculations rather time - consuming ) . for the presentation of the results ,",
    "we have used a larger time scale , @xmath55 .",
    "most of the results presented in this section correspond to the case of a  dry \" capillary , where the liquid in the reservoir is initially in equilibrium with the vapor in the pore at @xmath56 .",
    "this is realized by fixing the density of the fluid at the saturated liquid density @xmath57 in the first ( left ) layer in the @xmath2 direction and at the saturated vapor density @xmath58 in the rest of the pore .",

    "( [ evol ] ) and the liquid enters the pore .",
    "this is the case considered in the recent md simulations@xcite where the capillary walls are initially taken lyophobic and then switched to lyophilic at @xmath59 . as in these simulation studies , the pore in our set - up has its right end closed by a wall that prevents the fluid from escaping .",
    "an alternative set - up consists in starting from a  gas \" configuration inside the pore with the adsorbed films along the walls already formed . we shall also briefly consider this second situation as it is as well encountered in experiments with nanocapillaries@xcite .",

    "this illustrates the fact that the same states are encountered during imbibition and adsorption processes , the possible metastability of a state with respect to capillary condensation being irrelevant dynamically .",
    "one could thus interpret the jump associated to the passage of the precursor front as a _ dynamic _ layering transition that occurs when @xmath159 ( or @xmath170 ) reaches a certain critical value ( for example , @xmath171 for @xmath151 ) . in this interpretation ,",
    "the speed of the precursor is directly related to the time needed to reach this critical density . since the initial density in the layer increases with the pore width , as noted above",
    ", this time gets shorter and the precursor moves faster as @xmath3 increases , which is indeed observed in our calculations .",

[ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] with [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] shows that this behavior is also observed in our calculations , but this is now due to the fact that the meniscus no more competes with the precursor film for the liquid coming from the reservoir .",
    "the diffusion coefficient for the total uptake on the other hand is smaller than in the previous set - up ( note that the product @xmath172 is almost the same in the two cases because eq .",

    "to summarize , we have investigated spontaneous imbibition in a narrow slit pore in the framework of a dynamic lattice mean - field theory that explicitly includes liquid conservation but neglects momentum transport .",
    "the theory is able to reproduce the main characteristic feature of imbibition in the quasistatic regime , namely the constant slowing down of the interface described by the macroscopic @xmath0 lucas - washburn law .",
    "when the capillary is initially dry and the solid - fluid interaction is sufficiently attractive ( so that the static contact angle is zero ) , we have found that thin precursor films move ahead of the meniscus , following also a @xmath0 law , as also reported by recent simulation studies@xcite .",
    "the jump in the average fluid density in the pore that is associated to the passage of the precursor front may be interpreted as a dynamic layering transition , whose existence can be predicted from the corresponding adsorption isotherms . due to mass conservation ,",
    "the meniscus and the precursor compete for the liquid coming from the reservoir , which induces a nontrivial dependence of the speed of the interface on the strength of the solid - fluid interaction . on the other hand , the total fluid uptake increases monotonously .",
    "this contrasts with the simpler behavior observed in a capillary where thin films adsorbed on the pore walls are pre - existing : in this case , both the speed of the meniscus and the fluid uptake increase with the solid - fluid interaction and rapidly saturate in the complete wetting regime .",
    "the extent to which the above predictions may be tested in actual experiments or in simulations remains an open question .",
    "we have emphasized that the system length is an issue that must be carefully treated in simulations when precursor films are present . at a different level , since our treatment has drastically simplified the complexity of the problem , the phenomena revealed by our calculations may be hidden or significantly altered . for instance , we have neglected a possible dependence of the molecular friction coefficient on the strength of the solid - fluid interaction in the first layers adjacent to the pore walls .",
    "this dependence has been invoked to explain the nonmonotonic variation of the film spreading rate on solid substrates with different surface energies@xcite .",
    "this could be included in the present theory by modifying the jump rate parameter @xmath42 in the first layer ( for instance , by taking @xmath173 where @xmath174 is some constant ) . by reducing the speed of the precursor for large @xmath66 , this would in turn accelerate the speed of the meniscus .",
    "the absence of hydrodynamics is of course another very serious limitation if one wishes to go beyond a mere account through an effective elementary time scale . in principle",
