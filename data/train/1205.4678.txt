    "it is well known that general relativity ( gr ) based on the einstein - hilbert action ( without taking into account the dark energy ) can not explain the acceleration of the early and late universe .",
    "therefore , gr does not describe precisely gravity and it is quite reasonable to modify it in order to get theories that admit inflation and imitate the dark energy .",
    "the first tentative in this way is substituting einstein - hilbert term by an arbitrary function of the curvature scalar @xmath1 , this is the so - called f@xmath19 theory of gravity .",

    "the dependence on @xmath2 can take source from the introduction of exotic imperfect fluid or from quantum effect ( conformal anomaly ) .",
    "in this theory , the equations of motion show the presence of an extra - force acting on the test particles , and the motion are generally non - geodesic .",

    "the @xmath0 models that are able to reproduce the fourth known types of future finite - time singularities have been investigated @xcite .",

    "thus , the dominant term in ( [ josiane ] ) reads @xmath300 here , one can distinguish two cases : ( @xmath301 and @xmath302 ) and ( @xmath303 and @xmath304 ) .",

    "in this work we discussed the viability of an interesting alternative gravitational theory , namely , modified @xmath0 theory of gravity , where @xmath1 is the curvature scalar and @xmath2 the trace of the energy momentum tensor . for our purpose",

    "depending of having @xmath274 or @xmath120 , and according to the fact that the present stage of the universe may be characterized by the @xmath174cdm model , we distinguished two sub - models for the first one .",
    "thus for @xmath274 and @xmath119 , the first model reduces into @xmath166 , where @xmath172 and @xmath173 , while for @xmath120 and @xmath125 , the model reduces into @xmath319 , where @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
