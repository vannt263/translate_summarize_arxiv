    "one of the important purposes for the studies of the @xmath0 scattering is to understand the @xmath1 interaction , since the isospin zero @xmath1 amplitude or @xmath2-neutron amplitude can be obtained only through the @xmath0 scattering . recently some experimental studies@xcite have suggested that the pentaquark resonance @xmath3 with a narrow width might be excited in this isospin channel , although its existence has not been confirmed yet .",
    "as the @xmath2 meson is built from a @xmath4 quark state , it can not form the conventional three - quark resonance with a nucleon .",
    "so the pentaquark resonance must have the exotic structure such as a @xmath5 quark state and the coupling with the @xmath1 system is expected to be weak .",
    "in fact , the width of the @xmath3 has been found to be less than 1 mev@xcite through the analysis of@xmath6the @xmath0 reaction .",
    "therefore the @xmath1 system is the weaker interacting system compared with other meson - nucleon systems such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 which have the strong couplings with resonant particles .",
    "the @xmath0 scattering at low energies is much simpler than the @xmath9 and @xmath10 scatterings since the pion - absorption in the @xmath9 scattering and the conversion to @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the @xmath10 scattering occur even at the threshold . at incident",
    "kaon momenta below 600 mev / c , where the pion production does not occur , the @xmath0 system has only three reactions , i.e. , the elastic scattering @xmath13 , the breakup reaction @xmath14 and the charge exchange reaction @xmath15 .",
    "thus the analysis of the @xmath0 scattering at low energies is suited to rigorously examining the validity of various theoretical models@xcite .",
    "one of them is the three - body calculation by the faddeev method@xcite where the multiple scattering effects have been estimated accurately .    because of the weak @xmath1 interaction , the single scattering impulse approximation is able to successfully describe the total cross sections at incident momenta ( @xmath16 above @xmath17500 mev / c which are obtained via the optical theorem .",
    "furthermore the elastic differential cross sections at the low momentum transfer can be explained even at lower energies .",
    "however , the single scattering impulse approximation explicitly violates the unitarity at incident momenta below @xmath17200 mev / c , where the integrated elastic cross section is found to be larger than the total cross section@xcite , and fails to describe the breakup differential cross section at the forward kaon scattering angles@xcite .",
    "this means that the multiple scattering effects should be incorporated in a theory to describe the @xmath0 scattering consistently , particularly , at low energies . if the pentaquark resonance @xmath3 would exist , one could see the signal in the cross sections of the @xmath0 reactions at @xmath18 @xmath19450 mev / c . in this energy region , the multiple scattering effects are expected to still have a non - negligible contribution@xcite and thus have to be considered in the study of the @xmath3 resonance .",
    "in this paper we will investigate the @xmath0 scattering by using the optical potential defined in the multiple scattering theory of watson@xcite .",
    "our optical potential consists of the first - order and second - order terms .",
    "the second - order optical potential is constructed to include the multiple scattering corrections such as the kaon rescattering , the pauli correction and the n - n interaction .",
    "one of the features of this approach is that it does not violate the unitarity .",
    "since this formulation has a simple structure , furthermore , the calculation is more easily performed than the faddeev calculation .",
    "we will examine how our optical potential works for the @xmath0 scattering and demonstrate the importance of the multiple scattering effects . to do so",
    ", we calculate the energy dependence of the total cross sections , integrated reaction cross sections and elastic cross sections and then compare our calculations with the data .",
    "we show that our approach predicts the data successfully as the faddeev method and especially the second - order optical potential is needed to describe both the data and the faddeev calculation at low energies .  indeed , the cross section calculated with only the first - order optical potential is not consistent with the faddeev calculation at low energies in spite of the weak @xmath1 interaction .",
    "our present work is the first application of the optical potential including the second - order term to the @xmath0 scattering .",
    "the optical potential up to second order is also obtained from the kerman - mcmanus - thaler ( kmt ) @xcite theory .",
    "we will discuss the relation between our approach and the kmt one .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : we present our formalism in sec.2 . in sec.3",
    "we show our calculations for the total , elastic and inelastic cross sections and compare them with the data and the faddeev calculation . in sec.4",
    "we summarize our work .",
    "to calculate the cross sections of the @xmath0 scattering , we use the optical potential derived from the multiple scattering theory .",
    "there are two formulations for the multiple scattering theory , i.e. , the watson@xcite and the kmt@xcite theories , which give the identical transition amplitude if any approximations are not used . in this work",
    ", we will employ the watson theory because the physical interpretation of the optical potential is clear .",
    "our optical potential will be constructed to incorporate the multiple scattering corrections such as the rescattering , the pauli effect and the n - n interaction .",
    "to do so , the second - order optical potential is considered in addition to the usual first - order optical potential .",
    "now we start from making a brief review of the watson formulation .    for the scattering of a positive kaon from a identical nucleons ,",
    "the transition amplitude @xmath20 is a solution of the lippmann - schwinger equation@xmath21 where@xmath22 here @xmath23 is the total energy , @xmath24 is the kaon kinetic energy and @xmath25 is the hamiltonian of the target nucleus .",
    "the two - body potential @xmath26 describes the interaction between the kaon and _",
    "_ i__th nucleon . @xmath27is a projection operator onto the antisymmetric subspace of the hilbert space .",
    "as far as one works in the antisymmetric subspace , the operator @xmath28 _ _  _ _ is not necessary in eq.([2.1 ] ) since @xmath20 and @xmath29 _ _  _ _ are symmetric operators . for later convenience ,",
    "however , it is inserted explicitly in eq.([2.1 ] ) .",
    "now we introduce a projection operator @xmath30 which projects onto the nuclear ground state and @xmath31 is defined by@xmath32 by using these operators , eq.([2.1 ] ) is rewritten in terms of the optical potential @xmath33 as@xmath34 where @xmath33 is given by@xmath35 with @xmath36 the kaon - nucleon t matrix @xmath37 in eq.([2.6 ] ) is defined by@xmath38    to evaluate the optical potential @xmath33 , we define another kaon - nucleon t matrix @xmath39 such that@xmath40 where the kaon propagates in the space of both antisymmetric and non - antisymmetric states of the nucleus .",
    "the relation between many - body operators @xmath37 and @xmath39 is@xmath41 here the operator @xmath42 projects onto the pauli - violating states . the second term of eq.([2.9 ] ) appears to remove the contribution of the transition to the pauli - violating states and the ground state from @xmath39 .",
    "if the term proportional to @xmath30 is neglected , the coherent rescattering is overcounted in the calculation of eq.([2.4 ] ) .    before constructing our model ,",
    "let us discuss the relation between the watson and kmt formulations . in the kmt theory ( see appendix ) , the following many - body operator @xmath43 is used to define the optical potential : @xmath44 where the projection operator @xmath30 does not appear since the coherent rescattering is counted in a different way .",
    "the relation between the operators @xmath37 and @xmath43 is given by @xmath45 the first - order optical potentials are given by @xmath46 for the watson approach and @xmath47 for the kmt approach , respectively .",
    "within this first - order expansion , the two approaches give the identical transition amplitude as pointed out in ref.@xcite .",
    "even if further approximations are assumed , this is still correct as far as the relation ( [ 2.9 - 2 ] ) holds . in the actual calculations",
    ", however , one usually uses the impulse approximation where @xmath37 and @xmath43 are replaced by the free two - body t matrix @xmath48 . in this case , the relation ( [ 2.9 - 2 ] ) does not hold and therefore the two approaches give different transition amplitudes .",
    "in fact , it has been shown from the studies@xcite of the pion - deuteron scattering that the kmt first - order optical potential is superior to the watson one .",
    "so it is necessary to go beyond the first - order optical potential in the impulse approximation and take into account the second term of eq.([2.9 ] ) in order to get the reliable results within the watson formulation .",
    "there are several models taking account of this term . in the delta - hole model@xcite , the second term of eq.([2.9 ] )",
    "is incorporated by adding a fock term to the delta - hole propagator . in the model of ref.@xcite ,",
    "the channel - coupled equations are derived from eq.([2.9 ] ) and are solved to get the first - order optical potential . in our work , we will expand the t matrix @xmath37 of eq.([2.9 ] ) in terms of @xmath39 and consider it to second order .",
    "now we construct the optical potential which will be used in our calculations . by substituting eq.([2.9 ] ) into eq.([2.6 ] ) , the optical potential @xmath33 can be given in terms of @xmath39 by@xmath49 which is explicitly written up to second order in @xmath39 .",
    "we note that the term including the operator @xmath42 does not appear in the second - order term of eq.([2.11 ] ) , because the matrix element of @xmath50 between the nuclear antisymmetric states vanishes .",
    "we now consider the deuteron as the target nucleus and introduce additional approximations to derive the optical potential in our approach . in the impulse approximation ,",
    "@xmath39 ( @xmath51 ) is replaced by the free two - body t matrix @xmath48 defined by@xmath52 with@xmath53 where @xmath54 ( @xmath51 ) is the kinetic energy of _ _",
    "i__th nucleon and @xmath55 is the collision energy for the kaon-__i__th nucleon subsystem . in our approach ,",
    "the effect of the nucleon - nucleon ( n - n ) interaction is taken into account because it is important at low energies and particularly it leads to the non - negligible final state interaction in the breakup reaction . since @xmath25 in eq.([2.2",
    "] ) is equal to @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the n - n interaction , the many - body green function @xmath58 can be expressed in terms of the two - nucleon t matrix @xmath59 as@xmath60 with@xmath61 where the collision energy of the two - nucleon subsystem is @xmath62 .",
    "thus the many - body operator @xmath39 is expressed as@xmath63 substitution of eqs.([2.14 ] ) and ( [ 2.16 ] ) into eq.([2.11 ] ) yields@xmath64 where@xmath65 here @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the first - order and second - order optical potentials , respectively .",
    "the higher - order potentials are neglected in our calculation .",
    "the second - order potential consists of three terms as@xmath68 where @xmath69 describes the double scattering , and @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the n - n scattering and the coherent rescattering terms , respectively . the quantity @xmath72 represents the effect of the modified n - n scattering where some contribution of the n - n bound state is excluded .",
    "we notice that in the vicinity of the n - n bound state pole at @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the kinetic energy of the center of mass of two nucleons , we may write,@xmath76    here we consider the relation between the watson and kmt transition amplitudes , i.e. , @xmath20 and @xmath77 .",
    "let us assume that the corresponding optical potentials are @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( see appendix ) , respectively .",
    "these transition amplitudes are expanded in powers of @xmath33 or @xmath80 as @xmath81 using the above equations , the amplitudes @xmath20 and @xmath77 can be rewritten in powers of  @xmath48 .",
    "then one finds the following relation,@xmath82 @xmath20 is equal to @xmath77 up to second order in @xmath83 .",
    "if the second term on the right side of eq.([2.20 - 3 ] ) would be small , the two approaches would give approximately the identical transition amplitude .",
    "we have numerically checked that this is true for the @xmath0 scattering .",
    "we note that @xmath84 at kaon momenta above @xmath17500 mev / c where the single scattering impulse approximation works well .",

    "however , at @xmath198 400 mev / c , the full calculation for the total cross section does not agree with the data . such discrepancy can be understood from the comparison of the total cross sections given by eq.([3.2 ] ) ( see the dotted lines in fig.1 and fig.5 ) .",
    "the total cross section represented by the dotted line in fig.5 is slightly larger than that in fig.1 , although both of the lines almost agree with the data .",
    "once the effects of the multiple scattering and the fermi motion are included in the calculation , however , this tendency leads to significant difference between the two calculations of the total cross sections shown in fig.1 and fig.5 .",
    "the single scattering impulse approximation is able to describe the @xmath0 data at incident momenta above @xmath17500 mev / c but explicitly violates the unitarity below 200mev / c and furthermore fails to explain the breakup reaction cross section at the forward kaon scattering angles .",
    "accordingly the single scattering impulse approximation is not satisfactory for explaining the @xmath0 scattering .",
    "our purpose was to examine how consistently the optical potential describes the @xmath0 scattering .",
    "this approach does not violate the unitarity unless an unphysical potential is used .",
    "another advantage of the optical potential is that the calculation is straightforward compared with the faddeev method .",
    "we constructed the optical potential consisting of the first - order and second - order terms .",
    "the second - order optical potential includes the double scattering term and the modified n - n scattering term .",
    "the first - order and second - order potentials were evaluated without any factorization in the momentum integration .",
    "this potential was used to calculate the total , integrated elastic and elastic differential cross sections at incident momenta below 800 mev / c .",
    "we found that our optical potential approach is able to explain both the faddeev calculation and the data consistently and especially the second - order optical potential plays an essential role at low energies .",
    "it was demonstrated in our calculations that the multiple scattering effects such as the coherent rescattering , the double scattering and the modified n - n scattering have an important contribution to the cross sections at low energies in spite of the weak @xmath1 interaction .",
    "this importance may be related to the fact that the wave - length of @xmath2 is comparable to the distance between two nucleons in the deuteron . at low energies ,",
    "therefore , the multiple scattering effects should be taken into account when one extracts the on - shell @xmath1 amplitudes from the @xmath0 data .",
    "this was confirmed through the comparison of the calculations obtained using two kinds of @xmath1 phase shifts .",
    "it is interesting to examine whether our approach is applicable for other reactions arising from the strong elementary interaction such as a @xmath199 scattering and a @xmath10 scattering .",
    "furthermore our optical potential approach could be used to study the effect of the pentaquark resonance @xmath3 in the @xmath0 scattering and especially learn how the effects of the multiple scattering affect the suppression of the resonance peak in the @xmath0 cross sections .",
    "our optical potential has been derived from the watson multiple scattering theory .",
    "similarly , the optical potential up to second order can be formulated based on the kmt multiple scattering theory as shown in appendix .",
    "we have numerically tested the difference between two approaches . within the first - order optical potential approach",
    ", the result by the watson formulation does not agree with that by the kmt formulation . in the latter calculation ,",
    "the integrated elastic cross section becomes larger than the total cross section at low momenta .",
    "this does not mean that the imaginary part of the kmt first - order optical potential is positive at low energies , but this is due to the factor @xmath200 appeared in the kmt formulation .",
    "when the second - order optical potential is taken into account , however , the two approaches give almost the identical cross sections .",
    "it was found from our numerical estimate that the difference was a few percent or less except near the threshold",
    ". therefore our conclusions in this paper are not changed by which formulation is chosen .",
    "the author would like to thank m.hirata for useful discussions .",
    "we will derive the optical potential from the kmt multiple scattering theory .",
    "the transition amplitude @xmath20 of eq.([2.1 ] ) is rewritten as@xmath201 where@xmath202 in order to get the kmt optical potential @xmath80 , we introduce the operator @xmath203 defined by @xmath204 in the kmt formulation , all equations are derived in the antisymmetric subspace of the hilbert space .",
    "consequently , the operators of @xmath43 , @xmath203 and @xmath205 are independent of @xmath206 . with the help of the relation @xmath207 , eq.([a4 ] ) can be expressed as@xmath208 where@xmath209 similarly , eq.([a2 ] ) is written as@xmath210 where@xmath211 the scattering operator @xmath20 is obtained by solving eq.([a6 ] ) , if the optical potential @xmath80 is given . with the help of eqs.([a6 ] ) and ( [ a9 - 1 ] ) ,  the operator @xmath80 can be written in terms of @xmath43 as@xmath212    now we build the first - order and second - order optical potentials using eq.([a12 ] ) .",
    "the operator @xmath43 can be written in terms of @xmath39 as eq.([2.9 - 1 ] ) in sec.2 . here",
    "the operator @xmath39 is defined by eq.([2.8 ] ) . by substituting eq.([2.9 - 1 ] ) into eq.([a12 ] ) , the operator @xmath80 can be expressed in terms of @xmath39 as@xmath213 we note that an intermediate state in the operators @xmath80 and @xmath39 is either an antisymmetric state or a non - antisymmetric state .",
    "eq.([a13 ] ) displays the kmt optical potential to second order in @xmath39 , which corresponds to the watson optical potential of eq.([2.11 ] ) .",
    "now we consider the optical potential @xmath80 used in the calculation of the @xmath0 scattering .",
    "using the same procedure mentioned in sec.2 , we obtain the final expression@xmath214 with @xmath215 where the operators @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath48 are defined in sec.2 ."
