    "in the past ten years , the rosat and asca observations of galaxy clusters have revealed that there exist tight correlations between the total gravitating mass of clusters ( @xmath6 ) and the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath7 ) and the temperature ( @xmath8 ) of the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) ( e.g. david et al . , 1993 ; white , jones & forman 1997 ; markevitch 1998 ; wu , xue & fang , 1999 ; horner , mushotzky & scharf 1999 ; etc . ) .",
    "presence of such relations has been also motivated by both the theoretical studies and the @xmath9-body numerical simulations .",
    "a close comparison of the theoretical / simulated results and the observed data can therefore provide valuable constraints on the prevailing cosmological models and even on the nature of dark matter which dominates the mass distribution and the dynamical evolution of clusters .",
    "however , in addition to its dependence on the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis , an accurate determination of @xmath6 often suffers from instrumental limitations , especially in those faint and distant clusters .",
    "this compares with the icm temperature measurements which can be relatively easily performed through the x - ray spectroscopy in most clusters .",
    "consequently , a well - established @xmath0  relation can instead be used as a powerful cluster mass estimator . in particular ,",
    "based on the @xmath0  curve , one is able to link the observable quantities with the theoretical press - schechter mass function , which appears to be crucial for the determinations of the cosmological parameters using the cluster abundances at different redshifts .    within the framework of pure gravitational infall ( e.g. , lilje 1992 ) ,",
    "the cluster mass and the gas temperature should scale simply as @xmath10 , where the index @xmath11 is almost unrelated to the different settings of the cosmological parameters .",
    "this self - similarity has been justified by cosmological @xmath9-body simulations ( evrard et al .",
    "1996 ; bryan & norman 1998 ; eke et al .",
    "1998 ) , and has also been tested by numerous observations .",
    "for example , hjorth et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have inferred the cluster mass from the weak and strong lensing for 8 clusters and confirmed such a tight mass - temperature relation .",
    "neumann et al .",
    "( 1999 ) analyzed the rosat pspc and hri data of 26 clusters and estimated the cluster mass by fitting the x - ray brightness profiles with the isothermal @xmath2-model , coupled with the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption .",
    "for a sub - sample of 15 targets whose temperature are available , they achieved a result consistent with @xmath12 .",
    "however , it should be noticed that in the above observational analyses , only high - temperature ( @xmath13 kev ) clusters are involved . as has been realized in many recent studies ( e.g. mohr , mathiesen & evrard 1999 ; ponman , cannon & navarro 1999 ) , the influence of energy feed - back into icm in the low - temperature clusters / groups can become more significant than that in the high - temperature systems .",
    "consequently , the self - similarity may break at the low - temperature end .",
    "indeed , this has been confirmed in nevalainen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) using a small sample of 9 clusters ( 6 clusters at @xmath14 kev and 3 groups at @xmath15 kev ) . from the asca and the rosat temperature profiles ,",
    "the authors have found that for the whole sample @xmath6 scales as @xmath16 , which is apparently steeper than the theoretical prediction , whereas @xmath17 still holds if the low - temperature groups are excluded .    in the scenario of preheated icm , such a similarity break",
    "can develop naturally in the low - temperature clusters / groups . a robust constraint on the break temperature ( @xmath18 ) can be obtained in principle by the observations of the @xmath7-@xmath8 or @xmath19-@xmath8 relations , which will in turn yield valuable information about the heating processes in the early phase of cluster formation . in the recent analysis of nevalainen",
    "( 2000 ) , only a lower limit of 1 kev could be set to @xmath20 due to the temperature gap between @xmath21 kev in their sample . on the other hand ,",
    "ponman et al .",
    "( 1999 ) evaluated the entropy of icm in different systems and argued that @xmath20 could be as high as @xmath22 kev . yet , this seems to be inconsistent with the finding of horner et al .",
    "( 1999 ) that the similarity of @xmath0  may continue until @xmath23 kev .    in this paper",
    ", we report our study of the @xmath0  relation using a combined sample of 22 galaxy clusters observed with rosat and asca .",
    "the radial x - ray surface brightness profiles are derived and fitted with different models .",
    "based on the best - fit parameters , the total gravitational masses scaled to the virial radius and the icm entropies at the cluster central regions are calculated under the assumption of isothermality . throughout this paper , we employ the mekal model ( mewe , kaastra & liedahl 1995 ) to calculate the thermal emission from the plasma with a mean metallic abundance of 0.4 solar , and set the hubble constant to @xmath24 km s@xmath25 mpc@xmath25 .",
    "our sample ( table [ tbl : targets ] ) consists of 22 galaxy clusters , whose redshifts range from @xmath26 to @xmath27 . at this distance range , the effect of cosmic evolution can be ignored .",
    "rosat pspc data archived at the institute of high energy physics ( beijing ) are analyzed . in general , the observations are chosen in such a way that targets are located near the center of fov , which makes it easier to study their diffuse x - ray emission as a whole .",
    "all the targets are sufficiently bright with their 210 kev flux being at least several @xmath28  @xmath29 . thus , with sufficient exposure times",
    ", high signal - to - noise ratio can be achieved .",
    "we selected targets that all demonstrate relatively good circular symmetry in their x - ray morphology , and contain no distinct substructures .",
    "such systems may have been undisturbed for rather a long time , for which the assumption of spherical symmetry is more reasonable .",
    "we have searched in the literature for the emission weighted asca temperatures for our targets . essentially , we choose the temperatures obtained when the central cluster regions are excluded .",
    "this is to avoid the complication due to the additional cool emission component ( e.g. buote 2000 ) .",
    "when the error bars of the temperatures are asymmetric , we adopt the values of the larger sides . among the targets",
    ", a262 has the lowest temperature at @xmath30 kev , and a2029 is the hottest one at about 10 kev .",
    "it appears that the sample almost covers the whole temperature range of clusters .",
    "the galaxy groups with even lower temperatures at @xmath15 kev are not included in this work .",
    "we have extracted the radial x - ray surface brightness profiles for the targets by directly using their 0.52 kev count rates ( figure [ fig : f1 ] ) .",
    "two approaches are adopted to analytically approximate the observed @xmath1 : the @xmath31 fit via the conventional @xmath2 model and the @xmath31 fit via the theoretically expected @xmath1 tracing a priori given dark matter density profile . for the latter , we use the cusped nfw profile and the empirical burkert profile with a definite core radius .",
    "if both galaxies and icm are assumed to be isothermal and trace the common gravitational potential in a cluster , the icm density @xmath32 can be represented by the so - called @xmath2 model when the galaxy distribution is assumed to follow the king profile ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) : @xmath33^{-3\\beta/2}.\\ ] ] this density profile can also be obtained by inversion of the observed @xmath34 in form of @xmath35^{-3\\beta+\\frac{1}{2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the core radius and @xmath2 is the slope parameter . here , we use @xmath37 to represent the three - dimensional radius and @xmath38 for the two - dimensional radius , both measured from the cluster center .",
    "the total cluster mass within radius @xmath37 can be derived from the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption as @xmath39      the second model we apply is the nfw profile , suggested by the high resolution @xmath40body simulations ( navarro , frenk , & white 1995 ) : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the halo density , @xmath43 is the scale radius , @xmath44 is the critical density of the universe , and @xmath45 is the characteristic density contract , respectively . in 1998 , makino , sasaki & suto derived an analytic form of gas distribution from eq([eq : nfw ] ) by assuming ( a ) spherical symmetry , ( b ) hydrostatic equilibrium , and ( c ) that the icm is an ideal gas : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a dimensionless constant . with eq([eq : nfwgas ] ) , we can straightforwardly calculate the icm x - ray emission and predict the corresponding x - ray surface brightness profile @xmath48 .",
    "fitting this theoretically expected @xmath48 to the x - ray observed one , we will be able to check the goodness of fit by the nfw profile and simultaneously fix the free parameters @xmath43 and @xmath45 .",
    "finally , we obtain the total cluster mass through @xmath49.\\ ] ]      many recent observations , mainly based on the measurements of the rotation curves of dwarf galaxies , have shown that galactic halos may have flatter cores rather than the cusped density profiles such as the nfw profile . indeed",
    ", such flat cores may develop if the dark matter particles are weakly self - interacting ( e.g. , spergel & steinhardt 1999 ; burkert 2000 ) .",
    "an empirical density form for such halos is proposed by burkert ( 1995 ) : @xmath50 in which @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the central density and core radius , respectively .",
    "although eq([eq : burkert ] ) was originally suggested for dwarf galaxies , it should also work for clusters , if the dark halos are self - similar .",
    "indeed , the recent simulations of yoshida et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have shown that eq([eq : burkert ] ) is applicable to clusters , provided that the halo particles are indeed self - interacting .    following makino et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we derive the radial gas distribution as @xmath53              - 2k_{0 } { \\rm arctg}\\left(\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right )                 \\left(\\frac{1}{r}+\\frac{1}{r_{0}}\\right )                  \\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "then , in a similar way to the nfw profile , we can predict the resulting x - ray surface brightness profile as a result of thermal emission and compare it with x - ray observations .",
    "this would allow us to check the goodness of fit and work out the free parameters in the burkert profile and hence , the total cluster mass .",
    "we find that the goodness of fit of @xmath1 is almost indistinguishable between the @xmath2 model and the nfw model ( table [ tbl : fits ] ) , but is apparently worse for the burkert model for which @xmath55 are larger by a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "we demonstrate one example ( a2199 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] by plotting the residuals of the fittings for the burkert profile .",
    "it is apparent that the model provides a significant overestimate of @xmath1 at about @xmath56 and an underestimate at the adjacent regions .",
    "the situation is quite common in our fittings , implying that the burkert model tends to give a core which is too flat .",
    "consequently , the failure of the burkert profile in the fittings of @xmath1 essentially excludes this empirical model in our mass estimates of clusters below .",
    "based on the best - fits with the @xmath2 model and the nfw model , we calculate the total cluster mass within the virial radius @xmath57 , which is defined as the radius where the mean cluster density is @xmath58 times of the critical density of the universe . as can be seen in table",
    "[ tbl : fits ] , the values of @xmath57 are typically in the range 1.53.5 mpc which are apparently larger than the observable radii of the clusters .",
    "here we estimate @xmath57 for each cluster using the extrapolated mass profile .",
    "the uncertainties in mass are calculated by taking into account the corresponding measurement errors in both the temperature and the surface brightness profile .",
    "it is found that the resulted mass errors are always dominated by the errors of the surface brightness profile .",
    "this last point is crucial because the estimates of virial radius and total cluster mass depend on gas temperature through equation ( 3 ) .",
    "an apparent correlation between @xmath59 and @xmath60 may arise if the errors of the gas temperature are relatively large .",
    "the mean error level for our cluster sample is about 20% , which is consistent with the predictions in the numerical studies .",
    "the resulting mass and temperature relation is plotted in figure [ fig : f3 ] .    for the entire sample ,",
    "we find that the best - fit mass - temperature relations are @xmath61 both of the relations are steeper than the theoretical prediction of @xmath62 . since such steepness has been suggested as a result of the pre - heating of icm , which could be more remarkable in the low - temperature systems , we have excluded the low - temperature clusters one by one to examine beyond which break temperature the similarity is restored .",
    "we find that when those clusters at @xmath63 kev are excluded , the @xmath0  scaling become self - similar again with @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath2 and nfw model , respectively .",
    "this result agrees well with the one found by ponmann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who discovered that in icm at @xmath66 kev the gas entropy is significantly higher than achievable through gravitational collapse alone .",
    "recently , tozzi & normal ( 2000 ) used a generalized model to simulate the x - ray properties of the clusters .",
    "their @xmath0  in the low density , cold dark matter universe with an initial entropy @xmath67 erg @xmath29 g@xmath68 is again in good accordance with our results , showing that the emission weighted temperature of the @xmath69 kev clusters are about 25% higher than what is predicted by the self - similar scaling .    in order to confirm our result of @xmath18 obtained via the @xmath0",
    ", we calculate the icm entropy at @xmath70 and illustrate the entropy - temperature distribution in figure [ fig : f4 ] , where we use the entropy variable @xmath71 .",
    "it appears that there is a clear tendency of the entropy increase for clusters at @xmath72 kev , suggesting again that @xmath18 should be between 3 and 4 kev .",
    "we have analyzed the archival data of rosat pspc pointing observations of 22 galaxy clusters with gas temperatures ranging from 2 to 10 kev .",
    "the radial surface brightness profiles are extracted from the 0.52 kev count rates , and are fitted with the @xmath2 model , the nfw model , and the burkert model , respectively .",
    "we have found that the goodness of fit is indistinguishable between the @xmath2 model and the nfw model , but is significantly worse for the burkert model .",
    "for the latter , the simple reason is that the burkert model tends to present too flat a core .",
    "if the burkert model can be used to describe the gravitational potential wells in both the galactic halos and cluster halos within the framework of the self - interacting scenario , we may conclude that the cross - sections of dark matter particles may vary with halo sizes .",
    "yoshida et al . ( 2000 ) have recently arrived at the similar conclusion by analyzing their @xmath9-body simulations .",
    "based on the best - fit parameters of the @xmath2 model and the nfw model , we have calculated the cluster mass within the virial radius ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "an examination of the @xmath0  shows that the @xmath0  is steeper than the self - similarity prediction unless the clusters at @xmath73 kev are excluded .",
    "a further study of the icm entropy as a function of the temperature shows that an entropy floor is likely to present in the clusters cooler than @xmath14 kev .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the break temperature of the self - similarity is at about 34 kev .",
    "we have noticed that based on a more complicated sample with spatially resolved temperature profiles , finoguenov , reiprich & bhringer ( 2000 ) have arrived at a similar conclusion .",
    "finally , our @xmath0  may be moderately affected if the intracluster gas deviates from the simple isothermality .",
    "indeed , previous studies have arrived at conflicting results regarding the radial temperature gradients in clusters . for examples ,",
    "irwin & bregman ( 2000 ) and tamura et al . (",
    "2001 ) claimed an essentially flat temperature profile , while markevitch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and kaastra et al .",
    "( 2000 ) reported a noticeable decline of gas temperature at large radii .",
    "however , according to the recent analysis of finoguenov , reiprich & bhringer ( 2000 ) , it is unlikely that the @xmath0  can be significantly altered even if the temperature gradient is taken into account .",
