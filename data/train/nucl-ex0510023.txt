    "we have previously observed that @xmath0 , @xmath1 and charged hadron yields are significantly suppressed especially for the high @xmath3 region ( @xmath3 @xmath7 @xmath8 gev / c ) in au+au collision at 200 gev compared with p+p collisions.@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite since there is no suppression in d+au collisions at high @xmath3,@xcite it is understood that the suppression occurs due to the final state interaction at the collision such as the gluon radiation in the hot dense matter .",
    "another evidence for the suppression being a final state effect comes from the non - suppression of the direct photon yield in au+au collisions.@xcite to understand the character of the suppression more , the comparison between different system size ( p+p / d+au / cu+cu / au+au ) measurements has been studied , and an extended @xmath3 reach to 20 gev / c has been afforded by the long run4 au+au dataset .",
