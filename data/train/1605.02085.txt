    "the length of the mirror was 80  mm and the width was 20  mm .",
    "the mirror was placed on a non - conductive surface and contained in a helium flow chamber having an entrance and exit windows made of kapton@xmath67 film .",
    "the metallic working surface of the mirror served as the first electrode while a separate second grounded electrode was placed inside the chamber above the mirror at a distance of about 20 mm .",

    "the x - ray beam incident on the mirror was delivered by a si ( 111 ) double - crystal monochromator ( dcm ) .",
    "the dcm was detuned to suppress high - order si bragg reflections at high photon energies .",
    "the electric current between the electrodes in the flow chamber was measured using a source meter with applied bias voltages of @xmath68 200 v. the observed maximum electric currents ( at the photoemission peak ) were @xmath55  10  -  80 na with greater values at higher photon energies .",
    "electric current in the absence of x rays ( i.e. , dark current ) was @xmath27  100  pa .",
    "the root mean square fluctuations in the measured signal were about 20  pa . a calibrated solid state detector was placed behind the flow chamber to measure the reflected x - ray flux ( mirror in the beam ) and the incident x - ray flux ( mirror out of the beam ) .",
    "the size of the incident beam was set to @xmath69  mm@xmath70 ( vertical@xmath71horizontal ) using x - ray slits placed upstream of the mirror chamber .",
    "the incident beam was centered on the surface of the mirror .",

    "the absence of saturation at the positive potential ( +  200  v ) suggests that the potential is insufficient to recapture all the electrons in the system .",
    "we note that in the case of pd mirror studied earlier @xcite full charge collection was observed for both positive and negative potentials .",
    "detailed explanation of this phenomenon requires consideration of energy spectra of the emitted photoelectrons and their energy transfer to he atoms via collision processes . for the purpose of linearity of detection of the integral photoelectron yield it was sufficient to ascertain the saturation at -  200  v in the present case .",

    "one of the main disadvantages of xrr is that spatial separation of the incident and the specularly reflected radiation becomes problematic in very grazing incidence ( @xmath74  1  mrad ) at high photon energies ( @xmath75  20  kev ) .",
    "reliable detection of the specularly reflected radiation requires @xmath76-@xmath77 geometry and a large dynamic range of the radiation detector .",

    "<S> however , the absorption contrast between pt and cr remains substantial which explains reduction in the intensity of spectral peaks at @xmath47 and @xmath60 .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> our findings demonstrate that structure of buried layers can be studied with hard x - rays , yet , without detection of the reflected radiation . </S>",
    "<S> instead , integral photoelectron yield is detected using simple voltage - bias - driven collection of generated electric charges above the surface of the studied material . </S>",
    "<S> it should be mentioned that the approach is rather general and is not limited to the case where the top layer represents a conductive material . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , self - detection of x - ray standing wave - effects have been observed on non - conductive materials such as diamond ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . </S>",

    "<S> , it can be useful for quantitative evaluation of surfaces in enclosed geometries where implementation of the conventional @xmath65 xrr arrangement is not possible . </S>",
    "<S> potentially , the use of very hard x - rays at very grazing incidence is feasible since contrary to xrr no effort is required to isolate the reflected radiation from the incident x - rays . </S>",
