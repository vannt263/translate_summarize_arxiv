    "working directly on the output of detector reconstruction programs when performing data analyses is an established habit amongst particle physicists . nevertheless , at the experiments of hera and lep it turned out to be an advantage to have uniform access to calorimeter energy depositions , tracks , electrons , muons etc .  which requires a new level of abstraction on top of the reconstruction layer",
    "examples of physics analysis packages providing this level are h1phan and alpha of the h1 and aleph experiments .",
    "noticed effects were , amongst others , that + a ) users could relatively quickly answer physics questions , + b ) the physics analysis code was protected against changes in the detector reconstruction layer , + c ) and finally the management liked the fact , that the relevant reconstruction output had been used in the analysis .    while previous programs were designed to provide a rather complete view of the event originating from a single @xmath0 or @xmath1 scattering , a next generation package is challenged by hadron collisions with @xmath2 simultaneous events .",
    "this implies a large number of possible interpretations of the triggered events and sometimes requires the analysis of dedicated regions of interest .",
    "the `` hysics nalysis epert '' toolkit ( pax ) is a data analysis utility designed to assist physicists in these tasks in the phase between detector reconstruction and physics interpretation of an event ( fig.[fig : pax ] ) .",
    "the alpha - version of pax was presented at the hcp2002 conference @xcite . in this contribution",
    "we introduce the beta - version .",
    "( 16.5,5.0 ) ( 0,1 ) ( 8,3 . )",
    "( 6.5,0 . )",
    "( 12.5,0.5 )",
    "the design of the next generation physics analysis utility pax has been developed according to the guidelines listed below :    1 .   the package is a utility tool box in a sense that the user has full control of every step in the program execution .",
    "2 .   the programming interface should be as simple and intuitive as possible .",
    "this minimizes the need to access the manual and thereby increases the acceptance in the community .",
    "furthermore , simplicity enables also physicists with limited time budget or limited knowledge of object oriented programming to carry out complex physics analyses .",
    "3 .   the package supports modular physics analysis structures and thus facilitates team work .",
    "the complexity of todays and future analyses makes team work of many physicists mandatory .",
    "4 .   existing physics analysis utilities can be connected .",
    "examples are tools for fourvector gymnastics which are available in general form ( e.g.  in the clhep library ) , other examples are histograms , fitting routines etc",
    ". 5 .   the physics analysis package can be used consistently among different high energy physics experiments .",
    "many use cases are to be taken care of .",
    "the following list is certainly not complete : 1 .",
    "access to the original data of the experiment is possible at each stage of the physics analysis .",
    "this enables detailed control of all analysis steps , and access to experiment - dependent information and related methods .",
    "2 .   when studying events of a monte carlo generator , relations between generated and reconstructed observables are accessible at any stage of the analysis",
    "this allows the quality of the detector reconstruction to be studied in detail .",
    "3 .   without significant code changes ,",
    "a complete analysis chain can be tested with different input objects such as reconstructed tracks , generated particles , fast simulated particles etc .",
    "relations between reconstructed physics objects ( tracks , muons , etc . ) and vertices are available , as well as hooks for separating multiple interactions .",
    "the decay chains with secondary , tertiary etc .",
    "vertices can be handled in events with multiple interactions .",
    "information of different objects can be combined , e.g. , tracks and calorimeter information .",
    "7 .   a common challenge in data analysis",
    "are reconstruction ambiguities which need to be handled .",
    "administration of these ambiguities is supported .",
    "the user finds assistance in developing analysis factories with multiple physics data analyses carried out simultaneously .    to cope with these challenges ,",
    "the advantage of using an object oriented language is obvious . for the convenience of connecting to other packages",
    ", c++ was the language of choice for the realisation of pax .",
    "the basic unit in pax is a view of the event which we call `` event interpretation '' .",
    "the event interpretation is a container used to store the relevant information about the event in terms of collisions , vertices , fourvectors , their relations , and additional values needed in the user s analysis .",
    "the corresponding class is denoted _ paxeventinterpret _",
    "( fig.[fig : eventinterpret ] ) .",
    "the user books , fills , draws , copies , advances the event interpretation , and has the ultimate responsibility for deleting it .",
    "when the user finally deletes an instance of _ paxeventinterpret _ , instances of objects which have been registered with this event interpretation  collisions , vertices , fourvectors , etc .",
    " are also removed from memory .",
    "( 10.0,6 ) ( 0,0 )    a copy of an event interpretation is a physical copy in memory .",
    "it is generated preserving all values of the original event interpretation , and with all relations between collisions , vertices , and fourvectors corrected to remain within the copied event interpretation .",
    "in addition , the histories of the individual collisions , vertices , and fourvectors are recorded .",
    "the copy functionality simplifies producing several similar event interpretations .",
    "this is advantageous typically in the case of many possible views of the event that differ in a few aspects only .",
    "although the event interpretations do not know of each others existence , recording the analysis history of collisions , vertices and fourvectors requires intermediate event interpretations to exist .",
    "therefore , we recommend to delete all event interpretations together after an event has been analysed .",
    "besides the features mentioned , the _ paxeventinterpret _ also defines an interface to algorithms such as jet algorithms , missing transverse energy calculations etc .",
    "this eases the exchange of algorithms within , or between analysis teams .",
    "pax supports three physics quantities : collisions , vertices , and fourvectors .",
    "three classes have been defined correspondingly .",
    "the class _ paxcollision _ provides the hooks to handle multi - collision events ( fig.[fig : eventinterpret ] ) .",
    "vertices and fourvectors are defined through the classes _ paxvertex _ , and _",
    "paxfourvector_. since the user may need to impose vector operations on them , both pax classes inherit from the clhep classes _ hep3vector _ , and _ heplorentzvector _ , respectively .",
    "their functionalities are available to the user .",
    "the _ paxvertex _ and _ paxfourvector _ classes contain additional functionality which mainly result from features proven to be useful in the previously mentioned h1phan package .    for all physics quantities the user can store additional values ( data type _",
    "double _ ) needed by the analysis via the class _ paxuserrecord_. these values are registered together with a key ( data type _ string _ functioning as a name ) , which must be given by the user .",
    "relations between collisions , vertices , and fourvectors are handled by a separate class called _ paxrelationmanager _",
    "( fig.[fig : relation ] ) .",
    "here we followed the design pattern _ mediator _ @xcite .",
    "examples for relations to be handled between physics quantities are fourvectors which originate from the primary vertex , an incoming fourvector to a secondary vertex , or connections between multiple collisions and their vertices etc .",
    "( 10.0,6 ) ( 0,0 )    when physics quantities are copied , the copied instance carries a pointer to the previous instance .",
    "an example would be a fourvector which is copied together with an event interpretation . in this way",
    ", the full history of the fourvector is kept throughout the analysis .",
    "the relation manager also allows parts of the event to be excluded from the analysis .",
    "an example would be a lepton which needs to be preserved while applying a jet algorithm .",
    "this locking mechanism is build in the form of a tree structure which enables sophisticated exclusion of unwanted event parts .",
    "for example , locking a collision excludes the vertices and fourvectors connected to this collision ( fig.[fig : lock ] ) . in the case of locking a secondary vertex",
    ", pax will lock the decay tree starting at this vertex .",
    "( 10.0,3.5 ) ( 0.5,0 . )",
    "note that when locking a fourvector @xmath3 , all fourvectors related to @xmath3 through its history record are locked as well .",
    "the same functionality applies to collisions and vertices . unlocking the fourvector",
    "@xmath3 removes the lock flag of all physics quantities related to @xmath3 through the decay tree , or the history record at the time the unlock command is executed .    for some applications , the user may want to inquire additional information on a physics quantity which is only contained in an experiment specific class",
    "an example is a _",
    "instance originating from a track of which the user wants to check the @xmath4 probability of the track fit .",
    "the relation manager allows to register instances of experiment specific classes which led to a _",
    "paxcollision _ , _ paxvertex _ , or _",
    "paxfourvector _ instance . to enable such relations , a template class _ paxexperiment@xmath5 _ has been defined which allows registration of arbitrary class instances . applying the c++ _ dynamic@xmath6cast _ operator",
    ", the user can recover the original instance , and access all member functions of the experiment specific class .",
    "pax uses the template class _ map@xmath5 _ from the standard template library ( stl ) @xcite to manage pairs of keys and items in a container .",
    "the user record in fig.[fig : eventinterpret ] is an example of such a container for pairs of data type _ string _ and _",
    "double_. for accessing a certain item , optimized stl algorithms search the _ map _ for the corresponding key and provide access to the item .",
    "all _ paxcollision _ , _ paxvertex _ , and _ paxfourvector _ instances carry a unique identifier of type _ paxid _ which is used as the key in the _ paxcollisionmap _ , _ paxvertexmap _ , and _ paxfourvectormap _ of an event interpretation ( fig.[fig : eventinterpret ] ) .",
    "pointers to the collision , vertex , and fourvector instances are the corresponding items . in this way , fast and uniform access to the individual physics quantities is guaranteed .    for users not familiar with stl iterators",
    ", we provide the _ paxiterator _ class which gives a simple and unified command syntax for accessing all containers in pax .",
    "the pax user guide is available on the web @xcite .",
    "in addition to a paper version of the manual , we provide a fast navigator web page which can be used as a reference guide .",
    "the pax package is explored by the karlsruhe cdf group in top quark analyses .",
    "example feynman diagrams of signal and background processes relevant to top analysis in the so - called electron plus jet channel are shown in fig.[fig : feynman_top ] .",
    "( 10.0,7.0 ) ( 0,3.5 ) ( 4.5,3.5 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 4.5,0 )      the cdf detector reconstruction program provides already excellent reconstruction algorithms for the calorimeter , track finding , electron identification etc . to further advance these results",
    "we fill them into instances of the _ paxeventinterpret _ class ( fig.[fig : eventinterpret ] ) .",
    "examples are the calorimeter energy measurements , the tracking output , jet searches , and electron , muon , and photon identification . for the graphical representation of the different event interpretations in fig.[fig : eventcombine ] we use the root package @xcite .",
    "the lines indicate the direction of the fourvectors , and the lengths correspond to their energies . in order to optimize the energy measurements and take into account the advanced particle identification algorithms of the reconstruction software",
    ", we combine different results into a single event interpretation .",

    ", the histograms vertical axis shows the reconstructed transverse energy sum as a function of the true transverse energy sum .",
    "the latter was determined from the generated hadrons and leptons , excluding neutrinos .",
    "the algorithm provides a good measurement of the event total transverse energy .      to optimize separation of signal from background processes",
    ", we set up an `` analysis factory '' based on the pax event interpretation concept . in the top quark factory , every event is examined with respect to different processes which include electroweak and strong production of top quarks , as well as w- and z - production ( fig.[fig : feynman_top ] ) .",
