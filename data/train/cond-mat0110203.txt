    "multifractal measures are normalized distributions lying upon fractal sets .",
    "such measures appear naturally in a variety of nonlinear - physics context , the most well studied being natural measures of chaotic dynamcial systems @xcite .",
    "other well studied examples are the voltage distribution of random resistor networks @xcite . in this paper",
    "we address the harmonic measure of diffusion limited aggregates @xcite , which is the probability measure for a random walker coming from infinity to hit the boundary of the fractal cluster .",
    "this was one of the earliest multifractal measures to be studied in the physics literature @xcite , but the elucidation of its properties was made difficult by the extreme variation of the probability to hit the tips of a dla versus hitting the deep fjords . with usual numerical techniques",
    "it is quite impossible to estimate accurately the extremely small probabilities to penetrate the fjords .",
    "contrary to harmonic measures of conformally invariant fractals like random walks and percolation clusters whose multifractal properties can be solved exactly @xcite , the present multifractal measure posed stubborn barriers to mathematical progress .",
    "the multifractal properties of fractal measures in general , and of the harmonic measure of dla in particular , are conveniently studied in the context of the generalized dimensions @xmath1 , and the associated @xmath5 function @xcite .",
    "the simplest definition of the generalized dimensions is in terms of a uniform covering of the boundary of a dla cluster with boxes of size @xmath8 , and measuring the probability for a random walker coming from infinity to hit a piece of boundary which belongs to the @xmath9th box . denoting this probability by @xmath10 ,",
    "one considers @xcite @xmath11 where the index @xmath9 runs over all the boxes that contain a piece of the boundary .",
    "the limit @xmath12 is the fractal , or box dimension of the cluster . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the well known information and correlation dimensions respectively @xcite .",
    "it is well established by now @xcite that the existence of an interesting spectrum of values @xmath1 is related to the probabilities @xmath10 having a spectrum of  singularities \" in the sense that @xmath15 with @xmath16 taking on values from a range @xmath17 .",
    "the frequency of observation of a particular value of @xmath16 is determined by the the function @xmath5 where ( with @xmath18 ) @xmath19    the understanding of the multifractal properties and the associated @xmath5 spectrum of dla clusters have been a long standing issue . of particular interest are the values of the minimal and maximal values , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , relating to the largest and smallest growth probabilities , respectively .",
    "the minimal value of @xmath16 is relatively easy to estimate , since it has to do with the scaling of the harmonic measure near the most probable tip .",
    "while the often cited turkevich - scher conjecture @xcite that @xmath22 satisfies the scaling relation @xmath23 is probably not exact , it comes rather close to the mark . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximal value of @xmath16 is a much more subtle issue .",
    "as a dla cluster grows the large branches screen the deep fjords more and more and the probability for a random walker to get into these fjords ( say around the seed of the cluster ) becomes smaller and smaller .",
    "a small growth probability corresponds to a large value of @xmath16 .",
    "previous literature hardly agrees about the actual value of @xmath21 .",
    "ensemble averages of the harmonic measure of dla clusters indicated a rather large value of @xmath24 @xcite . in subsequent experiments on non - newtonian fluids @xcite and on viscous fingers @xcite , similar large values of @xmath21 were also observed .",
    "these numerical and experimental indications of a very large value of @xmath21 led to a conjecture that , in the limit of a large , self - similar cluster some fjords will be exponentially screened and thus causing @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "if indeed @xmath25 , this can be interpreted as a phase transition @xcite ( non - analyticity ) in the @xmath26 dependence of @xmath1 , at a value of @xmath3 satisfying @xmath27 .",
    "if the transition takes place for a value @xmath28 then @xmath21 is finite .",
    "lee and stanley @xcite proposed that @xmath21 diverges like @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the radius of the cluster .",
    "schwarzer et al .",
    "@xcite proposed that @xmath21 diverges only logarithmically in the number of added particles .",
    "blumenfeld and aharony @xcite proposed that channel - shaped fjords are important and proposed that @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mass of the cluster ; harris and cohen @xcite , on the other hand , argued that straight channels might be so rare that they do not make a noticeable contribution , and @xmath21 is finite , in agreement with ball and blumenfeld who proposed @xcite that @xmath21 is bounded .",
    "obviously , the issue was not quite settled .",
    "the difficulty is that it is very hard to estimate the smallest growth probabilities using models or direct numerical simulations .    in a recent letter @xcite",
    "we used the method of iterated conformal maps to offer an accurate determination of the probability for the rarest events .",
    "the main result that was announced was that @xmath21 exists and the phase transition occurs at a @xmath26 value that is slightly negative .",
    "in the present paper we discuss the results in greater detail , and offer additional insights to the geometric interpretation of the phase transition . in sect .",
    "2 we summarize briefly the method of iterated conformal maps and explain how it is employed to compute the harmonic measure of dla with unprecedented accuracy . in sect .",
    "3 we perform the multifractal analysis and present the calculation of the @xmath5 curve . in sect .",
    "4 we discuss a complementary point of view of the scaling properties of the rarest regions of the measure , to achieve in sect .",
    "5 a geometric interpretation of the phase transition . sect .",
    "6 offers a short discussion .",
    "consider a dla of @xmath33 particles and denote the boundary of the cluster by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an arc - length paramterization .",
    "invoke now a conformal map @xmath36 which maps the exterior of the unit circle in the mathematical plane @xmath37 onto the complement of the cluser of @xmath33 particle in the @xmath38 plane . on the unit circle @xmath39 the harmonic measure",
    "is uniform , @xmath40 .",
    "the harmonic measure of an element @xmath41 on the cluster in the physical space is then determined as @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "note that in electrostatic parlance @xmath44 is the electric field at the position @xmath45 .",
    "thus in principle , if we can have an accurate value of the conformal map @xmath36 for all values @xmath46 we can compute the harmonic measure with desired precision .",
    "we will see that this is easier said than done , but nevertheless this is the basic principle of our approach .",
    "we thus need to find the conformal map @xmath36 .",
    "an excellent method for this purpose was developed in a recent series of papers @xcite .",
    "the map @xmath47 is made from compositions of elementary maps @xmath48 , @xmath49 where the elementary map @xmath48 transforms the unit circle to a circle with a semi - circular  bump \" of linear size @xmath50 around the point @xmath51 .",
    "we use below the same map @xmath48 that was employed in @xcite . with this map @xmath47 adds on a semi - circular new bump to the image of the unit circle under @xmath52 .",
    "the bumps in the @xmath38-plane simulate the accreted particles in the physical space formulation of the growth process .",
    "since we want to have _ fixed size _ bumps in the physical space , say of fixed area @xmath53 , we choose in the @xmath33th step @xmath54 the recursive dynamics can be represented as iterations of the map @xmath55 , @xmath56 it had been demonstrated before that this method represents dla accurately , providing many analytic insights that are not available otherwise @xcite .      in terms of computing the harmonic measure we note the close relationship between eqs.([defharm ] ) and ( [ lambdan ] ) .",
    "clearly , moments of the harmonic measure can be computed from moments of @xmath57 . for our purposes here we quote a result established in @xcite , which is @xmath58 to compute @xmath59 we rewrite this average as @xmath60 where @xmath35 is the arc - length of the physical boundary of the cluster . in the last equality we used the fact that @xmath61",
    ". we stress at this point that in order to measure these moments for @xmath62 we _ must _ go into arc - length representation .    to make this crucial point clear we discuss briefly what happens if one attempts to compute the moments from the definition ( [ lamdq ] )",
    ". having at hand the conformal map @xmath63 , one can choose randomly as many points on the unit circle @xmath64 $ ] as one wishes , obtain as many ( accurate ) values of @xmath57 , and try to compute the integral as a finite sum .",
    "the problem is of course that using such an approach _ the fjords are not resolved_. to see this we show in fig.1 panel a the region of a typical cluster of 50 000 particles that is being visited by a random search on the unit circle , with 50 000 samples . like in direct simulations using random walks ,",
    "the rarest events are not probed , and no serious conclusion regarding the phase transition is possible .",
    "= 6truecm = 6truecm    another method that can not work is to try to compute @xmath65 by sampling on the arc - length in a naive way .",
    "the reason is that the inverse map @xmath66^{-1}(s)$ ] can not resolve @xmath67 values that belong to deep fjords .",
    "as the growth proceeds , reparametrization squeezes the @xmath67 values that map to fjords into minute intervals , below the computer numerical resolution . to see this ,",
    "consider the following estimate of the resolution we can achieve in the physical space , @xmath68 or equivalently @xmath69 on the left hand side we have the resolution in the physical space relative to the fixed linear size of the particles . with double precission numerics we can resolve values of @xmath70 and since we know that the values of @xmath71 can be as small as @xmath72 inside the deepest fjords ( and see below ) , we see that @xmath73 therefore the resolution in the physcial space which is necessary to achieve a meaningful probe of the deep fjord is highly inappropriate .",
    "the bottom line is that to compute the values of @xmath74 effectively we must use the full power of our iterated conformal dynamics , carrying the history with us , to iterate forward and backward at will to resolve accurately the @xmath67 and @xmath57 values associated with any given particle on the fully grown cluster .    to do this",
    "we recognize that every time we grow a semi - circular bump we generate two new branch - cuts in the map @xmath75 .",
    "we find the position on the boundary between every two branch - cuts , and there compute the value of @xmath57 .",
    "the first step in our algorithm is to generate the location of these points intermediate to the branch - cuts @xcite .",
    "each branch - cut has a preimage on the unit circle which will be indexed with 3 indices , @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "the index @xmath77 represents the generation when the branch - cut was created ( i.e. when the @xmath77th particle was grown ) .",
    "the index @xmath8 stands for the generation at which the analysis is being done ( i.e. when the cluster has @xmath8 particles ) .",
    "the index @xmath78 represents the position of the branch - cut along the arc - length , and it is a function of the generation @xmath8 . note that since bumps may overlap during growth , branch - cuts are then covered , cf .",
    "[ largex ] .",
    "therefore the maximal @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "= 6truecm    after each iteration the preimage of each branch - cut moves on the unit circle , but its physical position remains .",
    "this leads to the equation that relates the indices of a still exposed branch - cut that was created at generation @xmath77 to a later generation @xmath33 : @xmath80 note that the sorting indices @xmath81 are not simply related to @xmath82 , and need to be tracked as follows .",
    "suppose that the list @xmath83 is available .",
    "in the @xmath33th generation we choose randomly a new @xmath84 , and find two new branch - cuts which on the unit circle are at angles @xmath85 .",
    "if one ( or very rarely more ) branch - cut of the updated list @xmath86 is covered , it is eliminated from the list , and together with the sorted new pair we make the list @xmath87 .",
    "next let us find the mid - positions at which we want to compute the value of @xmath57 .",
    "having a cluster of @xmath33 particles we now consider all neighboring pairs of preimages @xmath87 and @xmath88 , that very well may have been created at two different generations @xmath77 and @xmath89 .",
    "the larger of these indices ( @xmath89 without loss of generality ) determines the generation of the intermediate position at which we want to compute the field .",
    "we want to find the preimage @xmath90 of this mid - point on the unit circle , to compute @xmath91 there accurately . using definition ( [ trick ] )",

    "we see that now all the particles are probed , and every single value of @xmath91 can be computed .",
    "to compute these @xmath91 accurately , we define ( in analogy to eq.([trick ] ) ) for every @xmath95 @xmath96 finally @xmath91 is computed from the definition ( [ lambdan ] ) with @xmath97    we wish to emphasize the relevance of this equation : the problem with the coarse resolution that was exposed by eq .",
    "( [ resolution ] ) occurs only inside the deepest fjords .",
    "we note however that the particles inside the deep fjords were deposited when the clusters were still very small . for small clusters",
    "the resolution of the fjords does not pose a difficult problem .",
    "therefore , when we evaluate the derivative @xmath75 inside the deepest fjord at a point @xmath98 , we make use of the fact that @xmath99 and write the derivative in the form @xmath100 on the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ prod ] ) we see that within our limited numerical resolution @xmath98 , @xmath101 and the correponding values of @xmath57 are almost identical whereas for the righthand side this is not the case . by keeping track of the branch cuts",
    "we improve the precision inside the fjords dramatically . in other words ,",
    "the large screening inside the fjords is simultaneously the problem and the solution .",
    "the problem is that we can not use the standard approach in evaluating @xmath102 .",
    "the solution is that for a point @xmath98 inside the deepest fjords we always have that @xmath99 and therefore the evaluation ( [ prod ] ) helps to improve the resolution .    in summary ,",
    "the calculation is optimally accurate since we avoid as much as possible the effects of the rapid shrinking of low probability regions on the unit circle .",
    "each derivative in ( [ prod ] ) is computed using information from a generation in which points on the unit circle are optimally resolved .",
    "the integral ( [ mean ] ) is then estimated as the finite sum @xmath103 .",
    "we should stress that for clusters of the order of 30 000 particles we already compute , using this algorithm , @xmath91 values of the order of @xmath72 . to find the equivalent small probabilities using random walks would require about @xmath104 attempts to see them just once .",
    "this is of course impossible , explaining the lasting confusion about the issue of the phase transition in this problem .",
    "this also means that all the @xmath5 curves that were computed before @xcite did not converge . note that in our calculation the small values of @xmath91 are obtained from multiplications rather than additions , and therefore can be trusted",
    "having the accurate values @xmath91 we can now compute the moments ( [ lamdq ] ) .",
    "since the scaling form on the rhs includes unknown coefficients , we compute the values of @xmath59 by dividing @xmath105 by @xmath106 , estimating @xmath107 results for @xmath59 for increasing values of @xmath33 and @xmath108 are shown in fig .",
    "[ tau ] , panel a.    = 7truecm = 7truecm    it is seen that the value of @xmath59 appears to grow without bound for @xmath26 negative .",
    "the existence of a phase transition is however best indicated by measuring the derivatives of @xmath59 with respect to @xmath26 . in fig .",

    "it is quite possible that larger clusters would have indicated slighly more negative values of @xmath3 , ( and see below the results of different methods of estimates ) , but we believe that this value is close to convergence . the fact that this is so can be seen from the @xmath5 curve which is plotted in fig . [ alfalfa ] .",
    "= 7truecm    a test of convergence is that the slope of this function where it becomes essentially linear must agree with the @xmath26 value of the phase transition .",
    "the straight line shown in fig.3 has the slope of -0.18 , and it indeed approximates very accurately the slope of the @xmath5 curve where it stops being analytic .",
    "the reader should also note that the peak of the curve agrees with @xmath112 , as well as the fact that @xmath113 is also @xmath114 as expected in this problem .",
    "the value of @xmath6 is close to 20 , which is higher than anything predicted before .",
    "it is nevertheless finite .",
    "we believe that this function is well converged , in contradistinction with past calculations .",
    "an alternative way to the multifractal analysis is obtained by first reordering all the computed values of @xmath91 in ascending order . in other words , we write them as a sequence @xmath115 where @xmath116 is an ordering of the indices such that @xmath117 if @xmath118 . the number of samples we consider is usually large and therefore the discrete index @xmath119 might be treated as a continuous index @xmath120 and @xmath57 as a non - decreasing function of @xmath121 , @xmath122    we next consider the distribution of @xmath123 , which is calculated by the usual transformation formula @xmath124 using the distribution of @xmath57 we now do the following rewritings , @xmath125 in fig .

    "needless to say this alos implies that @xmath123 scales according to eq.([pscales ] ) . by averaging over 16 clusters of size n=20000",

    "the power law is characterized by an exponent @xmath135 .",
    "this is consistent with a phase transition for @xmath139",
    "at this point we would like to interpret the origin of the phase transition , which in light of the last section stems from the power law behavior of @xmath123 for small values of @xmath57 .",
    "we first identify the region on the cluster that supports the low values of @xmath57 that belong to the power - law tail of @xmath123 .",
    "consider again fig .",
    "[ lscl ] . the point denoted above as @xmath134 defines the maximum value for which we see a power law in @xmath57 vs. @xmath121 .",

    "[ angles ] shows an example of such a fjord . for each fjord",
