    "the description of galaxy formation and evolution becomes far more complicated if one considers that a galaxy is not an isolated island universe .",
    "many observations have shown that galaxies are in fact parts of groups , clusters and super - clusters , and that their properties are correlated with the environment in which they live .",
    "several authors have shown that the local and the large - scale environments play an important role in determining many galaxy properties , such as star formation rate , gas content and morphology @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed by theorists to account for these effects , such as ram pressure stripping , mergers and tidal effects @xcite .",
    "more than half of all stars in the local universe are found in massive spheroids ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to derive the assembly history of the bulk of the stellar mass in the universe",
    "it is thus fundamental to understand how and when the early - type galaxies ( hereafter , etgs ) built up their mass .",
    "several studies at @xmath2 indicate that the most massive galaxies in the field ( @xmath3 ) may also be the oldest at a given epoch @xcite .",
    "other studies have shown that the massive early - type cluster galaxies have evolved mainly passively since @xmath4 and that , since then , field galaxies have evolved as slowly as cluster galaxies @xcite .",
    "these studies imply an epoch of massive early - type galaxy formation at redshifts well beyond @xmath5 . at earlier epochs ,",
    "an abundance of dusty and star forming galaxies are found , which appear to be the progenitors of massive etg @xcite .",
    "contrary to what is observed in low redshift clusters , observations of @xmath6 proto - clusters have shown that the quiescent red sequence , which traces the passively evolving ellipticals , has yet to appear @xcite .",
    "this supports a paradigm where a more rapid evolution in denser environments is occurring a @xmath7 .",
    "more recent studies @xcite reveal the appearance of the red sequence of galaxies by @xmath8 , although with a large scatter .",
    "thus , galaxy cluster samples at @xmath9 provide a key link to the more active epoch at @xmath10 where proto - clusters around powerful high redshift radio galaxies are not yet populated by passively evolving etg @xcite .",
    "cluster galaxies have evolved and were more luminous and bluer at high redshift ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "other observational results , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , suggest that by @xmath7 we are entering the star formation epoch of massive etgs , leading us to ask whether the properties of etg at intermediate redshift are consistent with this interpretation . on the basis of these studies ,",
    "the evidence seems not only to indicate an epoch of massive early - type galaxy formation at @xmath11 but also that in the range @xmath12 , the environmental effects start to become more substantial .",
    "in fact , the most distant clusters known to date ( all at @xmath13 ) provide the strongest test of model predictions .",
    "relevant investigations include the observation of the aftermath of an off - axis merger in xmmxcs2215.9 - 1738 @xcite at z=1.45 , a tight red sequence of etg at @xmath14 @xcite , a slowly evolving @xmath15-band luminosity function at odds with hierarchical merging scenarios @xcite , and a tight and slowly evolving fundamental plane ( hereafter , fp ) out to z=1.25 @xcite have been found .",
    "intriguingly , @xcite have found that galaxies in a proto - cluster environment at @xmath16 have mean stellar masses and inferred ages that are @xmath17 times larger than identically selected galaxies outside of the structure .",
    "a long - standing prediction of hierarchical models is that etg in the field are younger for a given mass than those in cluster cores , since galaxy formation is accelerated in dense environments @xcite .",
    "studies at low redshift , using chemical abundance indicators @xcite or the analysis of fossil record data via line strength indices @xcite suggest that star formation in low density environments was delayed by 1 - 2 gyr .",
    "fp studies at @xmath18 have shown that massive etg in the field and in clusters ( @xmath19 ) share the same fp evolution ( @xmath20 vs. @xmath21 ) and have approximately similar ages ( within @xmath22 gyr ) and star formation histories ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "fp studies have also shown that @xmath20 ratios of massive cluster and field etg evolve slowly and regularly and that there is evidence that low - mass galaxies evolve faster than high - mass galaxies ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "this so - called _ downsizing _ effect is at odds with earlier semi - analytic model predictions @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , although it can be reconciled in the most recent versions based on @xmath23 cosmogony @xcite and assuming that dry - mergers between non star - forming etg may occur and build up the massive early - type galaxy population @xcite .",
    "the majority of the above mentioned studies have focused on rest - frame optical and/or infrared spectrophotometric data .",
    "however , the optical spectrum remains largely unaffected by moderate amounts of past or recent star formation .",
    "more recently , deep optical surveys ( e.g. fires @xcite , goods @xcite , combo-17 @xcite , musyc @xcite ) have provided access to the rest - frame uv spectrum beyond @xmath24 , enabling more in - depth studies of the etg population .",
    "studies of local etg have revealed the existence of relatively young stellar populations .",
    "such fossil record observations of absorption line - strengths @xcite find that stellar populations younger than @xmath25gyr ( i.e. which must have formed between @xmath26 and the present - day ) are common in etgs .",
    "furthermore , a significant fraction of z @xmath27 etg show relatively blue nuv - optical colors @xcite , within extended disks @xcite , indicating star - formation over the past gyr .",
    "the inferred recent star - formation amounts to only @xmath28% of the total stellar mass . in a more recent study , @xcite have also shown that a significant fraction of @xmath29 etg show relatively blue nuv colors , indicating star - formation over the past 1 gyr . at slightly higher redshift ,",
    "spectroscopic studies at @xmath30 have shown that both the brightest etg of rdcs1252.9 - 2927 @xcite and the massive etg in the gdds fields @xcite show evidence for recent ( i.e. , within 1gyr ) star - formation on the basis of prominent post - starburst features in galaxy spectra ( e.g. , @xmath31 absorption line ) .    however , since little is known about the dependence on the environment of the recent star - formation rates ( hereafter , sfr ) in etg at @xmath32 , in this work , we complement our modeling of galaxy spectral energy distributions ( hereafter , seds ) , from nuv to nir , presenting result of deep observations of etg in cluster and field obtained with _",

    "we will return to this point when discussing our results in  4.2 .      the new observations with _ vlt_/vimos in the @xmath0-band",

    "we note that the @xmath731 mag difference in depth between the two data - sets is not only due to the difference in the total allocated time , but also to the larger galactic extinction at the location of the cl1252 cluster ( @xmath74 , compared to the one at the cdfs location , @xmath75 ) . assuming an extinction following the @xcite relation",

    "it is evident from this figure that it might become very hard to distinguish different model parameters with sed fitting studies based on rest - frame optical and infrared photometry only ( i.e. , @xmath105 2700  ) .",
    "however , as we show in fig .",
    "[ sed_model ] , the use of information coming from the rest - frame uv is crucial to distinguish the different parameters of the stellar population modeling ( e.g. ages and @xmath1 ) . as we demonstrate in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ colmod ] , by including available uv rest - frame photometry in the sed fits ( @xmath49-band observed - frame 2000  at @xmath106 ) we are able to break the `` age - sfh degeneracy '' .",
    "note that the rest - frame uv remains also largely unaffected by the `` age - metallicity '' degeneracy , which plagues optical studies @xcite .",
    "hence the extensive panchromatic method we use maintains its age - sensitivity across a large range of masses , ages and @xmath1 , providing more reliable estimates of these parameters compared to those obtained using optical - to - infrared studies .    to account for the average age of the bulk of the stars in a galaxy , we refer throughout this paper to _ star - formation weighted _ ages , @xmath107 , defined as :    @xmath108    assuming @xmath109 as in eq .",

    "typical uncertainties on the mass determination are about @xmath116 ( i.e. , @xmath117 dex ) @xcite .",
    "the reliability of spectrum synthesis models at @xmath118 has long been debated ( @xcite and references therein ) . in the rest - frame nir regime , in early stages of the galaxy evolution , a short - duration thermally pulsating ( tp- ) agb phase is known to be relevant . in @xcite we have shown that pegase.2 @xcite , bc03 , and maraston models ( hereafter m05 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) yield consistent stellar masses ( within typical errors of @xmath119 ) for z@xmath120 etgs .",
    "therefore we do not expect our stellar mass estimates to much depend on the actual stellar population synthesis model adopted . on the other hand , in  4.2",

    "we note that the color and scatter of the sequence predicted by the models indicate that the existence of etg confined to a narrow cmr by @xmath124 is indeed consistent with predictions of hierarchical models including agn feedback .",
    "however , the latter still yield a somewhat flatter slope of the cmr and an excess of red , low - mass galaxies .",
    "these discrepancies constitute a common feature of all hierarchical models , due to the following physical processes : i ) the biasing effect , causing low - mass galaxies residing in high - density environment to collapse earlier ; ii ) the starbursts , present mainly at high - redshifts in biased density environments ( like those originating the clusters ) , triggering early star formation at @xmath125 ; iii ) the  strangulation  effect , namely , the stripping of gas in galaxies with shallow potential wells ( such gas is included in the intra - cluster medium ) .",

    "for comparison , we overplot the kr at @xmath133 found by @xcite ( dotted - dashed red line ) , k - corrected to our rest - frame @xmath49-band .",
    "our galaxies are brighter by 1 - 2mag than at low redshift , a discrepancy that other studies at @xmath134 have also found difficult to explain with the assumption that galaxies undergo only a pure luminosity evolution with redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "it is very clear in fig .",
    "[ andrew ] that the bulk of our galaxies in both samples have much larger densities that their local counterparts . to account for this effect in the context of a plausible formation scenario , semi - analytical modeling ( e.g. @xcite )",
    "suggests that etgs formed in gas - rich mergers can result in very dense stellar cores , as the gas is driven to the center of this `` wet '' ( dissipative ) merger where it very efficiently produces massive starburts .",

    "as we apply the method described in section  3.2 , we are able to directly compare the distribution of star - formation weighted ages in the field and in the cluster . as shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ timing ] , we find the overall relative distribution of cluster and field etg ages to be very similar .",
    "this result implies no significant delay in relative formation epochs is found for etg in either environments .",
    "we find that @xmath144% of massive etgs have ages in the range @xmath145 gyr in both cluster and field .",
    "to investigate the dependence of this result on the actual stellar population synthesis code adopted , we compare our current results ( based on bc03 models ) with those obtained with a set of similar dust - free csps templates built with @xcite models , adopting the same exponentially - declining sfhs of eq .",
    "[ eq : sfhs ] , and assuming solar metallicity and @xcite imf .",
    "the result of the analysis based on m05 models is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ timing ] where we still find the cluster and field relative age distributions to be very similar , despite the fact that the contribution of the tp - agb stars in these models are implemented in a different way .",
    "however , here we find that @xmath146% of galaxies have ages in the range @xmath145 gyr ; m05 models favor slightly younger ages ( @xmath147 gyrs ) for @xmath14820% of etg in both environments .",
    "this effect can be explained by the fact that , at about 1 gyr , m05 models account for a larger amount of 2 @xmath149 flux than bc03 models of the same age , resulting in significantly redder color at younger ages , thus can favor @xmath150 1 - 2gyrs best - fits in a few cases .    to summarize , we find that , regardless of the actual stellar population synthesis code adopted , cluster galaxies ages have the same relative distribution as their field contemporaries : no significant delay in their formation epochs is found , within the errors ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "this result is at variance with some versions of the hierarchical model of galaxy formation and evolution @xcite and with fossil record studies @xcite , but in remarkably good agreement with the ones derived by @xcite and @xcite from the evolution of the @xmath20 ratio .",
    "it should be noted that similar results are found by other works using independent methods and data - sets .    in the top - left panel of fig .",
    "[ quartetto ] we plot for both samples each galaxy age , @xmath152 , as a function of stellar mass .",
    "we note that the age of etg increases with galaxy mass in all environments , which is in agreement with the so  called _ downsizing _ scenario of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "this effect can also be seen in the the top - right panel of fig .",
    "[ quartetto ] , where we plot our galaxies lookback time to formation as a function of their stellar mass , in both environments .",
    "our result is in agreement with the one obtained with an independent method and data - set by @xcite and based on z@xmath153 etg ages estimated from the fp parameters ( see their fig .",
    "3 ) .    despite of the fact that cluster and field galaxy formation epochs are found to be similar ,",
    "it could still be possible that the timescales of their sfh are significantly different .",
    "firstly , the data show that the distribution of cluster and field optical colors is significantly different . as a function of the stellar mass ,",
    "cluster galaxies are found to lie on a very tight red - sequence , while those in the field populate the color - sequence with a larger scatter ( fig .",
    "[ umb_mass ] ) .",
    "secondly , in @xcite we find that the averaged spectrum of the cluster galaxies has a more pronounced 4000 break than that of the field sample .",
    "both these pieces of observational evidence find a natural explanation in the framework of our modeling .",
    "as shown in the bottom - right panel of fig .",
    "[ quartetto ] , as a function of stellar mass , we find that field etg span a larger range of timescales than their cluster contemporaries , which are formed with the shortest @xmath1 at any given mass .",
    "according to our models , cluster etg are found to have experienced more similar star - formation histories . as shown in the bottom - left panel of fig .",
    "[ quartetto ] , cluster etg form a color - age sequence with much smaller scatter than the field ones .",
    "as discussed in  2.1 , we recall that our field sample is more deficient in lower mass objects than the cluster sample because of the different depths of spectroscopic observations .",
    "however , even if the field sample were corrected for completeness , this would likely result in a larger fraction of field etg at low mass , which are the ones that we found with longer @xmath1 .",
    "hence this would amplify the difference between the typical timescales of the two samples , and so not affect our conclusions .",
    "the rest - frame fuv ( @xmath154 ) sed is a crucial range where hot ( @xmath155 ) , massive ( @xmath156 ) , short - living ( @xmath157 ) stars emit most of their light . thus it is a wavelength domain which is very sesnsitive to current or recent star formation .",
    "most of the light from etg is emitted in the optical and the nir rest - frame .",
    "however , the fuv can be used as a good tracer of the residual current star - formation and to trace back , within the last gyr , the most recent episode of star - formation .",
    "about 100myr after star formation ceases , an etg spectrum becomes dimmer and redder .",
    "therefore , the fainter the rest - frame uv emission is , the earlier the star formation must have stopped . over time , the galaxy spectrum fades and slowly reddens as the 4000 @xmath158 break becomes more pronounced .",
    "here we have used the _",
    "vlt_/vimos @xmath0-band observations described in  2.2 to empirically constrain the dependence on the environment of the most recent star formation processes in z@xmath136 etgs .    however , when analyzing uv rest - frame fluxes of massive etg it is important to recall that core helium burning stars on the horizontal branch ( hb ) are known to produce a `` uv upturn '' feature @xcite .",
    "this effect can , in principle , complicate the disentanglement of the contributions to the uv spectrum of the evolved and young stellar populations .",
    "however , the onset of the hb typically takes 9 gyr , meaning that , by z=1.2 ( when the universe is only 5gyr old ) , not enough cosmic time has elapsed for this population of stars to appear . hence the uv flux seen in our sample etg must originate only from young stars .    in fig .",
    "[ uband ] we show @xmath0-band magnitudes ( 1  radius aperture ; rest - frame @xmath159 ) as a function of stellar mass for the etg detected in the field ( filled blue circles ) .",
    "solid lines represent the 1@xmath72 limit magnitudes of both data - sets ( in blue for cdfs , in red cl1252 ) .",
    "dashed lines represent the 3@xmath72 limits .",
    "as already pointed out in  2.2 , the combined effect of shorter total exposure times and higher galactic extinction at the location of cl1252 , directly translates into a @xmath160 deeper @xmath0-band photometry for the cdfs .",
    "a large fraction ( 75 % ) of field etg are ( @xmath161 ) detected in the deep cdfs images .",
    "the observed magnitude of the median stack of these detections is @xmath0=27.46 mag ( blue dotted line of fig .",
    "[ uband ] ) , corresponding to a sfr=0.47 @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "an image of the median @xmath0-band stack of the etgs detected in the field , is displayed in the bottom - left corner of fig .",
    "[ uband ] .",
    "since none of the cl1252 etg is actually detected in our @xmath0-band data , we use their median stack , shown in the middle of fig .",
    "[ uband ] , to provide a robust upper limit of @xmath163 mag for the cl1252 early - type population , which corresponds to sfr@xmath164 .",
    "we note that the non detection of the cl1252 etg can not only be attributed to the shallower @xmath0-band data for the cluster . to prove this we have simulated how the cdfs detected etg would appear in the 1252 data ( more details can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "we randomly placed the 20 @xmath0-band detected cdfs etg ( 0.4 mag dimmed to match the relative difference in galactic extinction ) in the cl1252 maximally exposed region , avoiding objects detected in the @xmath0-band , and repeated this step 30 times .",
    "hence we generated 32 median stacks of 18 simulated galaxies each , picking up at random amongst the cutouts .",
    "aperture photometry ( 1  radius ) on these simulated _ cdfs@1252 _ stacks results in a median value of @xmath0=27.8 mag which is in agreeement with the dimmed inputs of the simulations . in the bottom - right corner of fig .",
    "[ uband ] we show one of these stacks , which would be clearly detected in 1252 . comparing this last value to the upper limit we measured in the cluster data , we can state with confidence that cluster etg are intrinsically fainter by at least 0.5 mag in the observed @xmath0-band than their field contemporaries of similar mass and optical - to - infrared colors .",
    "this observational evidence corroborates the results of our stellar population synthesis analysis described in the previous subsection . in our proposed scenario ,",
    "a generally shorter _ timescale _ of the star formation process among the cluster galaxy population would naturally result in a generally fainter observed @xmath0-band magnitudes compared to the field population at z@xmath136 .",
    "we have obtained photometric parameters : psf - matched aperture magnitudes in 9 bands from fuv to nir rest - frame ; and morphological information : effective radius , average surface brightness , srsic index and average surface stellar mass density for mass - selected samples of 45 cluster and field massive ( @xmath165 ) early - type galaxies at z@xmath58 .",
    "apart from a lower level of spectroscopic completeness for the least massive field galaxies , that we find not to affect our conclusions , our sample has the advantage of being photometrically complete at our mass limit and having galaxy types assigned spectroscopically .",
    "for both samples we also have derived stellar masses , ages , and star formation histories , parameterized as timescales , @xmath1 , of exponentially declining csp model templates built with bc03 and m05 models .      *",
    "cluster and field etg lie on a similarly tight kormendy relation at z@xmath58 .",
    "when compared to the local relation , our galaxies are 1 - 2mag brighter than at z@xmath730 , similar to what has been found by other studies at @xmath166 in the field ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the evolution of the kr can not be explained as pure luminosity evolution and we conclude that etg must undergo a similar size evolution in both environments .    * we find no dependence on the environment of the _ size vs. stellar mass _ relation , or for the _ average surface stellar mass density vs. stellar mass _ relation at z@xmath136 . as a comparison we constrast both of them with the local relations for etg found in sdss .",
    "we find that the bulk of our etg in both samples have much smaller sizes ( and larger densities ) than their local counterparts .",
    "our data therefore indicate a strong size evolution for both the cluster and field galaxies .",
    "* we find no significant delay in the formation epochs of massive etg observed in the cluster and in the field at z@xmath167 .",
    "this result is true robust for models that treat the contribution of the tp - agb stars in very differnt way ( i.e. , bc03 or m05 ) .",
    "however our result is at variance with some versions of hierarchical models @xcite and with fossil record studies @xcite , but is in remarkably good agreement with those obtained from the evolution of the @xmath20 ratio .    * the age of etg increase with galaxy mass in all environments , which is in agreement with the _ downsizing _ scenario .",
    "the site of active star formation must have shifted from the most massive to the less massive galaxies as a function of the cosmic time .",
    "the formation epochs of etg only depends on their mass and not on the environment they live in .",
    "* we present new deep @xmath0-band observations in the rest - frame fuv ( @xmath168 ) for both samples etg .",
    "we detected 75 % of the field etg at z@xmath136 .",
    "the observed magnitude of the median stack of these detections is @xmath0=27.46 mag , which corresponds to a sfr=0.47 @xmath162 .",
    "* none of the cl1252 etg was actually detected in our shallower ( by @xmath73 1 mag ) @xmath0-band data , but we used their median stack image to provide a robust upper limit of @xmath163 mag for the cl1252 early - type population , which corresponds to sfr@xmath164 .",
    "* using simulations , we find that the median stack of the cdfs etg could be clearly detected in the actual cl1252 data at @xmath0=27.8 mag . comparing this value to the upper limit we measured from the cluster data , we can firmly state that cluster etg are intrinsically fainter by at least 0.5 mag in the @xmath0-band than their field contemporaries of similar mass and optical - to - infrared colors .",
    "this observational evidence implies that the last episode of star formation must have happened more recently in the field than in the cluster .",
    "* the data also show two other compelling pieces of evidence that cluster and field sfhs are significantly different : 1 ) as a function of the stellar mass , cluster galaxies are found to lie on a very tight color sequence while the field galaxies populate it with a larger scatter ; 2 ) in a companion paper based on the same data - set , @xcite find that the averaged spectrum of the cluster galaxies has a more pronounced 4000 break than that of the field sample .",
    "* finally we have been also able to explain both these pieces of observational evidences in the framework of our stellar population modeling .",
    "field etg best - fit models span a larger range of timescales than their cluster contemporaries , which are formed with the shortest @xmath1 at any given mass .    while cluster and field galaxy observed at z@xmath136 form at approximately the same time , a high density environment is able to trigger more rapid and homogenous sfhs for the etgs , limiting the range of possible star - formation processes . in low density environments ,",
    "this effect must rapidly fade as etg undergo a much broader range of possible star formation histories .",
    "we also note that this scenario is in very good agreement with the one proposed by @xcite , based on the latest rendition of semi - analytic models ."
