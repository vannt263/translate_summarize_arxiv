    "the low - temperature collective physics of interacting quantum many - body systems often calls for a novel description in terms of emergent degrees of freedom that are not only distinct from those of the original constituents of the system , but describe certain `` fractions '' thereof .",
    "familiar examples include the spin - charge separation in one - dimensional metals @xcite , the electron fractionalization in fractional quantum hall states of two - dimensional electron gases @xcite , as well as the emergence of monopoles in spin ice @xcite or chiral magnets @xcite .",
    "quantum spin liquids in frustrated quantum magnets @xcite provide another important venue for such quantum number fractionalization .",
    "for these spin liquids the theoretical formulation of this phenomenon is often closely linked to a lattice gauge theory description of the quantum magnet ; the spin degrees of freedom typically decompose into spinons coupled to an emergent @xmath1 or z@xmath0  gauge field whose elementary excitations remain deconfined @xcite .",
    "one of the paradigmatic examples of a model harboring a z@xmath0  spin liquid ground state is kitaev s exactly solvable honeycomb model @xcite .",
    "it describes a spin-@xmath2 quantum magnet subject to strong exchange frustration arising from bond - directional interactions of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 labels the three different bond directions of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the low - energy physics of this spin model can be captured in terms of majorana degrees of freedom and a z@xmath0  gauge field .",
    "crucially , the gauge field remains static for the pure kitaev model , and identifying the ground state configuration of the gauge field reduces to an essentially classical problem .",
    "typically this yields a unique ground state with a finite gap for the elementary vison excitations of the z@xmath0  gauge field .",
    "fixing the gauge structure then allows to recast the original spin model as a free majorana fermion model and thus paves the way to a full analytical solution .",
    "the phase diagram of the kitaev model generically exhibits two types of spin - liquid phases . around the limits where one of the three couplings dominates over the other two one finds a gapped spin liquid which , for the two - dimensional honeycomb model , is known to exhibit abelian topological order @xcite . the second phase , which is found for roughly isotropic couplings ( i.e.  , @xmath5 ) is gapless and can generically be understood as a metallic state of the itinerant majorana fermions . for the two - dimensional honeycomb model the itinerant majorana fermions form a graphene - like band structure with two dirac cones @xcite .",

    "this materials - oriented search @xcite has produced various candidate 4d and 5d compounds , most notably na@xmath15iro@xmath16 , @xmath17-li@xmath15iro@xmath16  and rucl@xmath16 , which realize hexagonal arrangements of local , spin - orbit entangled @xmath18 moments that are indeed subject to strong bond - directional exchanges as indicated by recent experiments @xcite .",
    "a byproduct of this experimental search has been the discovery @xcite of the polymorphs @xmath19-li@xmath15iro@xmath16  and @xmath20-li@xmath15iro@xmath16 , which realize three - dimensional arrangements of the spin - orbit entangled moments which retain the _ tricoordination _ familiar from the hexagonal lattice .",
    "this has sparked a surge of interest in three - dimensional variants of the kitaev model which , hitherto , had evaded the attention of the broader community @xcite .",
    "it was quickly recognized that the analytical tractability of the two - dimensional kitaev model largely carries over to the three - dimensional variants , and it has recently been demonstrated that such three - dimensional kitaev models harbor a rich variety of gapless z@xmath0  spin liquids in which the emergent majorana metals form nodal structures which include majorana fermi surfaces @xcite , nodal lines @xcite as well as topologically protected weyl nodes @xcite . the purpose of this paper is to go beyond these initial examples and to impart a more systematic classification of gapless kitaev spin liquids in three spatial dimensions . in particular , we comprehensively discuss how the nature of the emergent majorana metal depends on the underlying lattice geometry .",
    "we do so by considering kitaev models for the most elementary three - dimensional , tricoordinated lattices , i.e.  , lattices that have elementary loops of only one fixed length @xcite . for instance , the well - known honeycomb lattice is the only tricoordinated lattice with elementary loops of length 6 .",
    "however , there are multiple lattice structures with elementary loops of lengths 7 , 8 , 9 or 10 ( and possibly higher ) , which are all three - dimensional .",
    "in fact , such three - dimensional , tricoordinated structures have been comprehensively classified in the work of wells in the 1970 s @xcite . here , we focus on those lattice structures that exhibit equidistant bonds and approximately 120@xmath21 bond angles at every vertex @xcite .",
    "an overview of the so - identified family of three dimensional , tricoordinated lattice structures and their basic properties is provided in table [ tab : lattice_overview ] .",
    "a convenient way to systematically label the individual lattices is to use the so - called schlfli symbol @xmath22 followed by a letter , where @xmath23 is the fixed polygonality ( or elementary loop length ) of the lattice , @xmath24 refers to the tricoordination of the vertices , and the additional letter simply enumerates the lattices for a given schlfli symbol .",
    "it should be noted that some of these lattices are well known in the literature under alternative names .",
    "these include the ( 10,3)a lattice , which has long been known as the laves graph @xcite in the crystallographic literature or as @xmath25 crystal @xcite in the mathematical literature .",
    "it has also been renamed hyperoctagon lattice @xcite by some of the authors of this manuscript in an earlier study .",

    "it is precisely this family of tricoordinated lattice structures that serves as principal input in our quest to comprehensively discuss three - dimensional kitaev models in the following .",
    "we show that these kitaev models harbor a plethora of gapless spin liquids that can be cast as different incarnations of majorana metals whose precise nature can be systematically understood from a basic symmetry analysis .",

    "a summary of our results characterizing the various majorana metals for different lattice geometries is provided in table [ tab : majorana_metals ] .",
    "we do so by listing the nodal manifold of gapless excitations in the band structure of the itinerant majorana fermions .",
    "as can be seen from the table , the various three - dimensional lattice geometries realize multiple examples for the emergence of fermi surfaces , nodal lines , or weyl nodes . as we will lay out in detail in the remainder of the paper , an understanding of the systematics in this table",
    "is closely linked to a symmetry analysis of the kitaev models for the respective lattice geometries ( see in particular sec .  [",
    "sec : symmetries ] ) .",
    "for instance , the occurrence of majorana fermi surfaces for the two lattices ( 10,3)a and ( 8,3)a is closely linked to a non trivial sublattice symmetry for these lattices .",
    "similarly , the emergence of weyl nodes can be understood from a close inspection of time - reversal and inversion symmetry .",
    "for instance , for a lattice with an _ odd _ number of bonds in the elementary loop , such as the ( 9,3)a lattice , time - reversal symmetry has to be broken spontaneously for the emergent majorana degrees of freedom , which in turn allows for the occurrence of weyl nodes . for the lattice ( 8,3)b it is a more intricate interplay of time - reversal symmetry , inversion symmetry , and non - trivial sublattice symmetry that allows for the emergence of weyl nodes in the majorana band structure without breaking time - reversal symmetry _ nor _ inversion symmetry , a situation that can not occur for electronic band structures .",
    "we will discuss these different incarnations of weyl physics in a broader context in sec .",
    "[ sec : weyl ] .",
    "for the two - dimensional kitaev honeycomb model , it is well known that the dirac spin - liquid of the pure kitaev model gaps out into a massive phase with non - abelian topological order when perturbing the spin system with a magnetic field pointing along the 111-direction , i.e.  , by considering a hamiltonian @xmath27 it may , thus , be a natural question to ask whether the breaking of time - reversal symmetry can give rise to gapped phases with non - trivial topological order also for three - dimensional kitaev models .",
    "bearing in mind that the kitaev model can be recast as a free majorana fermion system , one can immediately answer this question in the negative by considering the classification of topological insulators @xcite rooted in the symmetry classification of free - fermion systems @xcite .",
    "in this free - fermion classification scheme , the pure kitaev model falls into symmetry class bdi , while the one with broken time - reversal symmetry of eq",
    ".   belongs to symmetry class d. as can readily be seen from the classification tables of refs .",
    ", there are no topologically non - trivial band insulators in either symmetry class bdi or d for three spatial dimensions  in contrast to two spatial dimensions where symmetry class d allows for this possibility [ and as realized for hamiltonian on the honeycomb lattice ] .",
    "it is , of course , nevertheless an interesting question to ask what effect the breaking of time - reversal symmetry has on the majorana metals for the three - dimensional kitaev models of table [ tab : majorana_metals ] .",
    "the answer is provided in the third column of that table and is discussed in much detail in the remainder of the paper .",
    "generically , we find that the metallic nature per se remains untouched by the breaking of time - reversal symmetry , i.e.  , for no system do we observe a transition into a ( topologically trivial ) massive phase . instead , we find that the nodal structure remains robust under this perturbation for systems that exhibit majorana fermi surfaces or weyl nodes",
    ". the only effect of a ( small ) magnetic field is to either deform the majorana fermi surface or move the positions of the weyl nodes .",
    "a different picture emerges for those lattices where the pure kitaev model exhibits nodal lines . here",
    ", the magnetic field does alter the nodal structure .",
    "for the lattices ( 10,3)b and ( 8,3)c the magnetic field gaps out the nodal line with the exception of two or six nodes , respectively .",
    "these nodes turn out to be one or three pairs of weyl nodes . a symmetry analysis again indicates that another symmetry plays a crucial role in stabilizing this unusual band structure .",
    "it is the presence of inversion symmetry that fixes these weyl nodes to the fermi energy ( at zero energy ) for these lattices .",
    "inversion symmetry is absent for the chiral lattice ( 10,3)c , which also exhibits nodal lines for the unperturbed kitaev model . upon applying a magnetic field",
    "the nodal lines vanish and the system creates six pairs of weyl nodes , which in the absence of inversion symmetry are no longer fixed to the fermi energy and move away from it . the result is the emergence of 12 pockets of majorana fermi surfaces , each of which encapsulates a weyl node . as a result , these fermi surfaces also acquire some non - trivial topological properties from the weyl nodes , as we discuss in further detail in sec .",
    "[ ssec : topfermisurface ] . as such , the kitaev model for lattice ( 10,3)c stands out as the only system where the effect of breaking time - reversal symmetry is to _ increase _ the nodal structure and the associated density of states of the majorana metal .",
    "finally , we briefly comment on the z@xmath0  gauge structure of these models . as we will discuss in more detail in sec .  [ sec : kitaev ] , the assignment of local z@xmath0  gauges ( on the bonds of the lattice ) corresponds to an assignment of z@xmath0  fluxes through the elementary loops in the lattice .",
    "for the two - dimensional kitaev honeycomb model , this correspondence can be used to readily fix the gauge structure of the ground state via a theorem by lieb @xcite , which states that the ground state of the honeycomb model has no fluxes through any of the hexagonal plaquettes ( corresponding to the elementary loops ) .",
    "lieb s theorem can also be applied to three - dimensional kitaev models if the lattice structure exhibits certain mirror symmetries .",
    "as it turns out , only one of the lattices in our family , namely the lattice ( 8,3)b , fulfills this criterion .",
    "it is thus the only lattice for which we can rigorously assign the flux configuration of the ground state . for all other lattices",
    ", we have to resort to alternative ways to identify precisely this ground state configuration of the ( static ) z@xmath0  gauge field . in this study , we have resorted to numerical simulations of this essentially classical problem for finite systems . in general , we find that the result of this numerical procedure is a flux configuration that precisely corresponds to the one indicated by lieb s theorem if it were to apply to the lattice structure at hand .",
    "specifically , all elementary loops of length 2 ( mod 4 ) carry zero flux , while elementary loops of length 0 ( mod 4 ) carry @xmath28 flux .",
    "non - bipartite lattices with elementary loops of odd length are not covered by lieb s theorem at all . for these lattices",
    "we assign the flux configuration using symmetry arguments .",
    "notably , however , for the lattice ( 9,3)a our numerical checks indicate the possibility of low - energy flux assignments that break at least one of the point - group symmetries of the lattice .",
    "such an exotic scenario might also be relevant to lattice ( 8,3)c where the @xmath28-fluxes are subject to geometric frustration .",
    "we have not explored this possibility in full detail in the paper at hand , but instead have provided results for the lowest - energy z@xmath0  flux structure that does not break any point - group symmetries .",
    "we revisit this point in an outlook at the end of the paper .",

    "in particular , if a set of loop operators forms the boundary of a closed volume , the product of their eigenvalues is fixed to @xmath36 .",

    "for each of the lattices considered here , we can identify @xmath38 fundamental loop operators ( per unit cell ) , where @xmath39 is the number of sites per unit cell , from which all other loop operators can be built by successive multiplication .",
    "the hilbert space factorizes into eigenstates of these loop operators ( in the following called `` flux sectors '' ) and we will usually restrict our analysis to a single such flux sector .",
    "another consequence of the volume constraint is that flux excitations , also called visons , always form closed loops ; there are no magnetic monopoles in the corresponding z@xmath0  gauge field .",
    "following kitaev s original solution @xcite , we proceed to represent each spin in terms of four majorana fermion operators @xmath40 with @xmath41 , and @xmath42 denoting the site within the unit cell at position @xmath43 .",
    "the majorana fermion operators obey the usual anti - commutation relations @xmath44 this representation faithfully reproduces the spin algebra within the physical hilbert space defined by @xmath45 as a second step , we regroup the majoranas into bond operators @xmath46 , with @xmath20 being the label of the nearest - neighbor bond @xmath47 .",
    "the bond operators have eigenvalues @xmath34 , which therefore can be identified with an emergent z@xmath0  gauge field .",

    "kitaev models in the first category are those defined for lattices ( 8,3)b , ( 8,3)c , ( 8,3)n , ( 9,3)a , and ( 10,3)b , while the kitaev models for lattices ( 8,3)a , ( 10,3)a , and ( 10,3)c are in the second category 9see also table [ tab : majorana_metals ] ) .",
    "we discuss these two scenarios in further detail in the following two subsections .",
    "we will first concentrate on the case where the weyl nodes for one of our 3d kitaev models sit precisely at the fermi energy .",
    "the majorana energy dispersion relation for these systems is then in precise analogy to those of electronic weyl semimetals @xcite .",
    "these electronic weyl semimetals have garnered considerable attention for their recent observation in taas @xcite and photonic materials @xcite .",
    "an intense experimental effort is currently underway to observe the unusual response of these electronic weyl semimetals to electromagnetic fields such as the chiral anomaly @xcite and unusual negative magnetotransport @xcite .    for electronic systems",
    ", it has been realized early on that weyl physics can emerge by either breaking time - reversal or inversion symmetry @xcite . for the spin systems at hand it turns out that different symmetry scenarios are at play that give rise to weyl physics .",
    "primarily , we distinguish three different scenarios with respect to the role that time - reversal symmetry plays . in analogy to the electronic systems",
    ", we can find weyl physics when breaking time - reversal symmetry _",
    "explicitly_. this is the case , for instance , for the 3d kitaev models for lattices ( 10,3)b and ( 10,3)c exhibiting nodal lines in the presence of time - reversal symmetry and a number of weyl nodes when breaking time - reversal symmetry .",
    "this also includes the case of the kitaev model for the lattice ( 8,3)n , for which the emergence of weyl nodes arises from the splitting of a dirac cone upon time - reversal symmetry breaking .",
    "this scenario should be carefully distinguished from the physics that plays out for the kitaev model on the lattice ( 9,3)a where time - reversal symmetry is broken _ spontaneously _ and the system is then found to exhibit weyl physics .",
    "the third and most unusual scenario is the one found for the kitaev model for lattice ( 8,3)b . here , _ neither _ time - reversal nor inversion symmetry are broken , but the system nevertheless exhibits weyl physics , a symmetry scenario that is not possible for electronic systems .",
    "the reason that we can observe weyl physics in the spin system without breaking time - reversal nor inversion symmetry is that the _ projective _ time - reversal and inversion symmetry for the underlying majorana fermions are implemented in a non - trivial way .",
    "in particular , these projective symmetries incorporate momentum shifts by @xmath77 and a pair of weyl nodes at @xmath217 always has a pair of time - reversal partners at @xmath218 ( as long as time - reversal symmetry is intact ) .",
    "second , we note that due to particle - hole symmetry ( inherent on the level of the majorana fermions ) , each weyl point at position @xmath123 ( and energy @xmath219 ) will have a particle - hole partner of opposite chirality at position @xmath220 ( and energy @xmath221 ) .",
    "in contrast to the weyl points in an electronic weyl semimetal , one can not regard these as two independent weyl points .",
    "instead , it is more instructive to think of them as a single weyl point of a _ complex _ fermion ( rather than two weyl points of majorana fermions ) .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that the system at hand does not possess @xmath1 symmetry , but only z@xmath0   symmetry .",
    "thus , if neither time - reversal nor inversion symmetry are broken , we will encounter multiples of _ four _ weyl nodes for the underlying majorana system as it is indeed the case for the kitaev model of lattice ( 8,3)b .",
    "note that while each pair of weyl nodes has a corresponding chiral surface state , their effects cancel out each other exactly and the resulting spin liquid is not chiral . upon breaking of time - reversal symmetry ( e.g. by applying a magnetic field ) the perfect nesting between the two pairs of weyl nodes as well as the exact cancellation of their respective fermi arcs are destroyed .",
    "the lack of @xmath1 symmetry in weyl spin liquids has important consequences for various physical observables .",
    "most importantly , weyl spin liquids will not exhibit the usual chiral anomaly as charge pumping between weyl nodes is intimately connected to charge conservation and thus @xmath1 symmetry . instead ,",
    "weyl spin liquids will exhibit a more subtle incarnation of the chiral anomaly , to be discussed elsewhere .    on a more formal level",
    ", the different roles of symmetries in the weyl physics of electronic and spin systems is reflected in the classification of their underlying free - fermion hamiltonians in the 10-fold way symmetry classification scheme of altland and zirnbauer @xcite . for electronic systems , weyl semimetals",
    "are found in symmetry classes a or aii , corresponding to the breaking of either time - reversal or inversion symmetry , respectively .",
    "in contrast , for the kitaev models at hand , we find weyl physics in symmetry classes d or bdi depending on whether time - reversal symmetry is broken ( explicitly or spontaneously ) or not .",
    "this distinction of weyl physics in electronic and spin systems will likely impact their sensitivity to disorder , a direction that we will pursue in the future .",
    "we now want to turn to majorana metals where the weyl points occur at _ finite _ energy , which necessarily implies that they are encapsulated by a fermi surface .",
    "such fermi surfaces are called topological fermi surfaces in the following , as they are found to inherit some of the topological features of the enclosed weyl points .",
    "the physical properties discussed here are relevant for the lattices ( 10,3)a and ( 8,3)a , as well as ( 10,3)c for broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "let us first note that the chern number of a closed 2d surface is still well - defined , as long as it does not cut through any of the fermi surfaces . further the value of the associated chern number can not depend on whether or not the enclosed weyl point sits at zero energy .",
    "thus , even in the presence of fermi surfaces , we find that the effective two - dimensional hamiltonian defined on an arbitrary closed surface that surrounds a topological majorana fermi surface is that of a topological chern insulator . using the same arguments as above",
    ", we find that in the presence of boundaries the majorana fermi surfaces can not lie isolated in the surface brillouin zone , but must again be connected by ( chiral ) fermi arcs , see fig .",
    "[ fig:10_3_a_fermi_arc ] for an example .         coupling constant from 0 to @xmath222 where the system becomes gapped .",
    "red ( yellow ) dots denote the position of weyl points of positive ( negative ) chirality .",
    "the black dots are pairs of weyl points of opposite chirality . for @xmath223",
    "the weyl points start to split and annihilate at @xmath224 . ]",
    "the fact that weyl nodes can not be gapped out individually readily implies that the same is true for topological fermi surfaces .",
    "in fact , in order to gap them , one usually has to first annihilate their enclosed weyl nodes pairwise . for the lattices ( 10,3)a and ( 8,3)a",
    ", such pair annihilation can be observed when varying the relative strength of the three kitaev couplings . in particular",
    ", we find that pair annihilation occurs at touching points of two fermi surfaces .",
    "these touching points are , in fact , a pair of weyl nodes of opposite chirality . figures [ fig:10_3_a_jz ] and [ fig:8_3_a_jz ] show the evolution of the fermi surfaces along the line @xmath225 with the position of the enclosed weyl nodes denoted by the red ( positive ) and yellow ( negative ) sphere . for the lattice ( 10,3)a",
    ", the weyl nodes have charge @xmath226 and are located at @xmath227 for @xmath228 .",
    "at @xmath229 they split and pair - annihilate with the weyl nodes of opposite charge at @xmath224 .",
    "the resulting trivial fermi surface persists until @xmath222 , where the system becomes gapped .",
    "the behavior for the kiteav model on lattice ( 8,3)a is slightly different .",
    "the fermi surfaces are topological for @xmath228 .",
    "the touching point at @xmath229 marks the pair creation / annihilation of opposite - charge weyl nodes that split for @xmath223 and annihilate with the original weyl points at @xmath230 , see the sequence of fig .",
    "[ fig:8_3_a_jz ] .    .",

    "this results in topologically trivial fermi surfaces for @xmath232 . ]",
    "while our entire discussion so far has concentrated on the pure kitaev model , it is of course interesting to also discuss the effect of additional interactions ( e.g. , heisenberg exchange ) on the nature of the gapless spin - liquid ground state .",
    "such additional terms have in general two effects : the vison excitations of the z@xmath0  gauge field gain dynamics and obtain a dispersion , while the majorana fermions generically become interacting .",
    "the former effect may be ignored for sufficiently small perturbations , as the vison excitations remain gapped .",
    "the effect of interactions between majorana fermions depends crucially on the nature of the gapless modes . for quantum spin liquids with a fermi line or weyl points ,",
    "a scaling analysis as , e.g. , done in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that interaction terms are irrelevant at the kitaev point and that the spin liquid is therefore stable against small perturbations . for quantum spin liquids with a majorana fermi surface ,",
    "interactions turn out to be marginal . a careful analysis for the ( 10,3)a hyperoctagon lattice in ref .",
    "@xcite has shown that time - reversal symmetric interactions generically destabilize the majorana fermi surfaces even for infinitesimal coupling strength , and the surfaces gap out except for an odd number of nodal lines . in the following",
    ", we will briefly review the underlying mechanism and the main features of this instability , which will be referred to as a spin - peierls bcs instability for reasons that will become clear in the following .",
    "for further details we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .    as we have seen in section  [ sec : symmetries ] , a majorana fermi surface can only be stable if time - reversal symmetry is implemented non - trivially , i.e.  , with @xmath233 . combining this relation with particle - hole symmetry , we find that the spectrum necessarily exhibits perfect nesting of the majorana fermi surfaces , @xmath234 .",
    "this perfect nesting for lattices ( 10,3)a and ( 8,3)a is visualized on the left - hand - sides of figs .",
    "[ fig : spinpeierls ] ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively , with the perfect nesting vector indicated by the arrow .",
    "alternatively , we could have chosen to express the system in terms of complex fermions @xmath235 where @xmath236 denote the eigenmodes of the majorana hamiltoninan with @xmath237 for @xmath238 and @xmath239 due to particle - hole symmetry .",
    "the 2@xmath122 majorana fermi surfaces , thus , combine into @xmath122 complex fermi surfaces , and the perfect nesting condition becomes the usual bcs pairing condition @xmath240 , centered around @xmath241 .",
    "note that there is no @xmath1 symmetry in the system .",
    "instead , a non - vanishing pair correlator @xmath242 breaks translation symmetry spontaneously .",
    "the resulting dimerization of the system is reflected , e.g. , in the spin - spin correlations that acquire a staggered component .",
    "due to the spontaneous breaking of translation symmetry , this bcs - type instability shows similar features to the usual spin - peierls instability , except that the dimerization always sets in for infinitesimal interaction strength . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , any additional time - reversal symmetric interaction will , independent of the microscopic details , give rise to this kind of instability . for the kitaev model on lattice",

    "breaking time - reversal symmetry destroys the perfect nesting condition with wave vector @xmath77 , marked by the arrow . ]",
    "one way to stabilize the majorana fermi surfaces is by breaking time - reversal symmetry .",
    "this leads to a deformation of the majorana fermi surfaces ( as illustrated , e.g. , in fig .",
    "[ fig:10a_kappa ] ) that destroys the perfect nesting condition ,",
    "i.e.  , the original nesting vector @xmath77 does not map the two majorana fermi surfaces onto each other any longer .",
    "for the lattice ( 10,3)a , breaking time - reversal symmetry causes elongating / flattening of the surface along the four 111 directions as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : spinpeierls ] ( b ) .",
    "in both cases , translation along @xmath77 does not map the surfaces exactly onto each other .",
    "the resulting mismatch in energy cuts off the bcs instability at low enough temperatures and restores the fermi surface .",
    "the physics of fractionalization , accompanied by the formation of spin - liquid ground states , is beautifully embodied in the kitaev model .",
    "the model is unique in that it allows to precisely track on an analytical level the splitting of the original spin degrees of freedom into majorana fermions and a z@xmath0  gauge field .",
    "this study has explored this phenomenon for three - dimensional kitaev models with a focus on the collective physics of the itinerant majorana fermions , the formation of majorana metals whose nature intimately depends on the topology of the underlying lattice .",
    "we have provided a comprehensive classification of these majorana metals for the most elementary tricoordinated lattices in three spatial dimensions ( summarized in tables [ tab : lattice_overview ] and [ tab : majorana_metals ] ) , which is rooted in an elementary symmetry analysis of the projective time - reversal and inversion symmetries for these lattices .",
    "focusing primarily on the majorana physics , our study already attests to the rich physics of three - dimensional kitaev models , while also pointing to a number of future research directions which we briefly comment on in the following .    on a conceptual level",
    ", it will be interesting to complement the current analysis with a more rigorous study of the physics of the z@xmath0  gauge field for the family of three - dimensional kitaev models at hand .",
    "even for the pure kitaev model , for which the gauge field remains static , the ground state of the gauge field might be somewhat non - trivial for some of the lattices under scrutiny in this study .",
    "in particular , for lattice ( 9,3)a we have found possible evidence that some of the low - energy states or even the ground state of the z@xmath0  gauge field might break some of the point - group symmetries of the lattice . to further elucidate this possibility , a more stringent numerical approach is needed such as the monte carlo sampling approach recently developed by the motome group @xcite .",
    "such an unbiased , ergodic sampling approach would also be helpful in understanding the low - energy physics of the z@xmath0  gauge field for lattice ( 8,3)c , for which we find evidence of geometric frustration in the assignment of z@xmath0  fluxes , possibly leading to an extensive degeneracy of gauge field configurations in the ground state",
    ". it will be interesting to further explore how this possibly somewhat unusual physics of the z@xmath0  gauge field couples back to the formation of a collective state of the majorana fermions .",
    "one key distinction between kitaev models in two and three spatial dimensions is their finite - temperature behavior .",
    "for the three - dimensional kitaev models we expect to observe a finite - temperature phase transition at which the z@xmath0  gauge field orders @xcite .",
    "indeed such a finite - temperature phase transition has recently been observed in monte carlo simulations of the ( 10,3)b hyperhoneycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "generically , this transition is expected to be a continuous phase transition in the inverted 3d ising universality class . however",
    ", this must not be the case for lattice geometries where the zero - temperature physics indicates a breaking of time - reversal and/or point - group symmetries in addition to the z@xmath0  symmetry associated with the gauge theory",
    ". it will be interesting to numerically explore whether these systems exhibit a _",
    "single _ continuous finite - temperature phase transition , at which simultaneously multiple symmetries are broken spontaneously . if so , they will establish remarkable instances of lattice models whose critical behavior evades a description in terms of the landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) paradigm .",
    "in fact , such unconventional finite - temperature transitions in kitaev models might provide the most `` natural '' instances of non - lgw criticality in three - dimensional systems , which so far has been explored in the context of classical dimer @xcite and loop @xcite models  somewhat more artificially constructed systems that have no direct realization in a microscopic setting .",
    "complementary to this study of the gapless spin liquids arising for roughly equal coupling strength @xmath5 in three - dimensional kitaev models , it should be compelling to systematically investigate the gapped spin liquids which arise when one of the three couplings dominates over the other two .",
    "in particular , it will be interesting to go beyond initial studies of the ( 10,3)b hyperhoneycomb lattice @xcite and see whether some of these gapped phases give rise to non - trivial loop statistics @xcite .",
    "another important avenue will be to study the effect of disorder in these three - dimensional kitaev models .",
    "such an analysis is of particular interest for the weyl spin liquids found in a number of lattice geometries ( see table [ tab : majorana_metals ] and the discussion in sec .  [",
    "sec : weyl ] ) . what sets these weyl spin liquids apart from their electronic counterparts is their respective symmetry classification in terms of the ten - fold way classification scheme of free - fermion systems @xcite .",
    "weyl semimetals in electronic systems can arise from breaking either time - reversal or inversion symmetry , putting these systems into symmetry classes a or aii , respectively .",
    "in contrast , weyl physics in majorana systems ( which per se exhibit particle - hole symmetry ) can arise from breaking time - reversal symmetry ( akin to the electronic system ) but also without breaking of time - reversal symmetry _ nor _ inversion symmetry , putting the majorana systems into symmetry classes d or bdi , respectively .",
    "it will be interesting to identify to what extent disorder physics in weyl semimetals is sensitive to the underlying symmetry class .",
    "one of the most salient future research directions will be to go beyond the pure kitaev model and to study the physics arising from additional spin exchanges such as a heisenberg exchange .",
    "these magnetic interactions have two effects .",
    "they render dynamics to the z@xmath0  gauge field , allowing the elementary vison excitations to disperse through the lattice . at the same time",
    "these additional spin exchanges also induce interactions between the majorana fermions , possibly destabilizing the majorana metal of the pure kitaev model as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : spin - peierls ] on the spin - peierls instability of majorana metals with a majorana fermi surface @xcite .",
    "finally , we hope that our study highlighting the rich physics arising from fractionalization in three - dimensional kitaev models will provide further stimulus to the ongoing search for materials realizing spin - orbit entangled @xmath18 mott insulators with strong bond - directional kitaev - type exchanges",

    "while certainly not the focus of the current study , we might offer some minimal guidance for this experimental search in noting that one prerequisite facilitating the emergence of strong bond - directional kitaev exchanges is the occurrence of double exchange paths between the spin - orbit entangled moments on the tricoordinated lattice structure @xcite .",
