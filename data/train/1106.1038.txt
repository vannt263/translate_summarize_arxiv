    "the cocircuit graph is a natural combinatorial object associated with an oriented matroid . in the case of spherical pseudoline - arrangements , i.e. , rank 3 oriented matroids , its vertices are the intersection points of the lines and two points share an edge if they are adjacent on a line .",
    "more generally , the topological representation theorem of folkman and lawrence  @xcite says that every oriented matroid can be represented as an arrangement of pseudospheres .",
    "the cocircuit graph is the 1-skeleton of this arrangement .",
    "cordovil , fukuda and guedes de oliveira  @xcite show that a a cocircuit graph does not uniquely determine an oriented matroid .",

    "this characterization is strengthened by felsner , gmez , knauer , montellano - ballesteros and strausz  @xcite and used to improve the recognition algorithm of  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a generalization and strengthening of the characterization of sign labeled cocircuit graphs of uniform oriented matroids of  @xcite to general oriented matroids . after introducing the necessary preliminaries in the next section , we prove the main theorem in the last section .",

    "in order to prove theorem  [ thm : main ] we need two lemmas . the first one is about tope graphs of oriented matroids .",
    "tope graphs of oriented matroids are a special class of _ antipodal partial cubes _",
    "we will make use of a particular consequence of this :                      ( i)@xmath80 ( ii ) : let @xmath81 be a covector of rank @xmath82 and @xmath14 cocircuits in @xmath54 $ ] .",

    "the graphs @xmath94 are all contained in @xmath95 $ ] and @xmath76-connected by lemma  [ lem : tope2 ] .",
    "consecutive @xmath94 and @xmath96 intersect in at least @xmath97 vertices , because their intersection is a tope of a one - element - contraction minor of @xmath88 .",
    "together menger s theorem ( see e.g.  @xcite ) yields that the graph @xmath98 is @xmath99-connected .",
    "in particular there are @xmath99 internally disjoint paths connecting @xmath100 and @xmath101 in @xmath95 $ ] and thus the analogue holds for @xmath0 and @xmath102 in @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "hence @xmath54 $ ] is @xmath103-connected .",
    "( iii)@xmath80 ( i ) : we have to show that ( c3 ) holds for @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath79 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath105 be a crabbed @xmath57-path .",
    "since adjacent cocircuits have empty separator , there must be @xmath106 with @xmath26 .",
    "since @xmath105 is crabbed @xmath107 also satisfies @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "it shall be mentioned that the `` ( i)@xmath80 ( ii)''-part of the proof is only a slight generalization of a result in  @xcite .",
    "but there the characterizing quality of ( ii ) was not noted .",
    "furthermore we remark that the connectivity in ( ii ) is best - possible , since in uniform oriented matroids @xmath108 has exactly @xmath78 neighbors in @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "even if the cocircuit graph does not uniquely determine the oriented matroid , theorem  [ thm : main ] might lead to an effective recognition algorithm for cocircuit graphs of general oriented matroids , as its uniform specialization did in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , if one is given @xmath43 with edge set @xmath109 it is possible to check ( iii ) in @xmath110 , see part 5.c . of the algorithm in  @xcite .",
    "in contrast the naive algorithm to check ( c3 ) takes @xmath111 .",
