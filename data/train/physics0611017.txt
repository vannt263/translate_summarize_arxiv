    "<S> we have developed a self consistent technique to predict the behavior of plasmon resonances in multi - component systems as a function of wavelength . </S>",

    "<S> our approach is based on viewing the mixing of 3 components as the mixing of 2 binary mixtures , each in the same host . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained excellent predictions of the experimental optical behavior for mixtures of ag : cu : sio@xmath0 and alloys of au - cu : sio@xmath0 and ag - au : h@xmath0o , suggesting that the essential physics of plasmonic behavior is captured by this approach .    </S>",
    "<S> accurate control and prediction of plasmonic behavior in metal nanoparticles in various configurations are expected to realize future ultra - high density integrated photonic devices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , plasmonic effects in metal nanoparticle waveguide arrays and metal - dielectric interfaces have been used to transport electromagnetic energy below diffraction limited dimensions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> glasses containing metal nanoparticles exhibit intensity dependent refractive index values several orders of magnitude greater than that of silica glass due to dielectric and quantum confinement effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these enhanced effects , occurring due to surface plasmon effects at the interface of the metal and the dielectric , could allow various use of linear and nonlinear optical responses of mixtures @xcite , provided appropriate materials are selected @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimental observations have also demonstrated that composites containing multiple metals show multiple plasmonic peaks as well as dependence of such peaks on metal fraction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the large optical nonlinearities , the waveguiding capability and multiple - wavelength sensitivity offered by plasmon behavior makes it an important area of study with potential applications to optoelectronics , sensing , etc . </S>",
    "<S> _ in this letter , we develop and demonstrate a self consistent technique to accurately predict the effective dielectric constant of multi - component systems and apply it to ternary nanocomposites for which reliable experimental data are available _ </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> _    the accurate prediction of the optical properties of nanocomposites made from multiple optical materials is an outstanding problem in current research . </S>",
    "<S> this is primarily because the effective permittivity is not uniquely determined by the optical properties of the individual components but also requires knowledge of the composite microstructure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> previous theoretical work in this area has focused primarily on estimating the effective permittivity of two - component mixtures where one of the components is a dielectric and the other is a metal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are numerous models that predict the effective permittivity of _ two _ component composites @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there are already established rigorous bound for the values of the permittivity in such composites @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , these models have not been extended to or applied towards interpreting the behavior of multi - metal composites and typically multi - parameter fitting routines have been used to reproduce experimental data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but such fitting approaches are of limited use in predicting the fundamental behavior of unexplored nanocomposite systems and hence , are not generally applicable tools for new product design . </S>",
    "<S> recently it was shown that the problem of calculating the bounds for a multicomponent system can be reduced to the determination of the convex - hull generated in the complex plane when the volume fraction of each component act as a barycentric coordinate for the hull @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the limitations of this approach is that it can be used only for obtaining the loosest bounds which are the wiener bounds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these loose bounds can not predict the location of the plasmon resonances in frequency space for a simple two component system . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the resonance enhancement of the absorption takes place at @xmath1 and is in contradiction to the well known condition for the resonance at @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the volume fraction of the metal , @xmath4 is the dielectric permittivity of the host and @xmath5 is the real part of the dielectric permittivity of the metal or inclusion .    here </S>",
    "<S> we report a self consistent technique that accurately predicts the plasmonic behavior , including peak positions , shifts and shapes , in multi - metal mixtures and/or alloy nanocomposites without the need for any fitting parameters . </S>",
    "<S> our approach begins with the fact that for a two component nanocomposite the tightest lower bound on the dielectric permittivity can be expressed through the bergman - milton formula @xcite , ( which is based on restricting the values of the effective dielectric permittivity in the complex plane using suitably defined conformal mappings ) as : @xmath6}\\right]^{-1}\\label{eq : bergmilton}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the volume fractions of the constituent materials with relative permittivity @xmath9 and @xmath4 respectively , and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath11 takes the values @xmath12 . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath13 because it corresponds to the exact maxwell garnett mixing rule @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the upper bound corresponds to the complementary mixture and is not of interest to us .    </S>",
    "<S> the central idea of this paper is to use eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : bergmilton ] in a self consistent fashion within the effective medium approximation to calculate the effective permittivity of a three component or ternary nanocomposite . </S>",
    "<S> we begin with the hypothesis that a three component system formed by @xmath9 , @xmath14 and the host @xmath4 can be viewed as a mixture of two components , each having an effective permittivity @xmath15 and @xmath16 calculated using eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : bergmilton ] . in this mixing process </S>",
    "<S> the average electric field within the composite is held fixed at every stage of mixing . </S>",
    "<S> the constraint in the volume fraction is introduced while calculating the individual effective permittivities while the final effective permittivity is calculated using _ equal _ volumes of each mixture . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> notice that @xmath4 , which represents the dielectric permittivity of the host matrix , is common to both mixtures . </S>",
    "<S> this simple binary mixing rule , depicted graphically in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : schematic - of - mixing ] , can be stated as follows : _ the effective permittivity of an n - component mixture can be determined by mixing n-1 binary mixtures , each comprising of a host and a distinct metal , with the host being common to the n-1 pairs_. in this letter we focus on applying this mixing rule to ternary systems for which experimental data exists .    in order to test the validity of our hypothesis we have calculated the optical absorption coefficient of ternary composites containing multi - metal and/or alloy nanocomposites using experimental data for the individual permittivities of the metals obtained from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the binary mixing rule was applied to the formation of nanocomposites made from mixtures of two metals , as shown in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : schematic - of - mixing](a ) , and for alloys , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : schematic - of - mixing](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also introduced a modification to the imaginary component of the permittivity of each metal in order to account for the enhanced rate of electron scattering due to particle size - dependent effects by modifying the drude model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this was accomplished by expressing the imaginary component in the high frequency limit as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the bulk plasmon resonance frequency of the metal , and @xmath19 is an effective relaxation time given by : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the bulk relaxation time of the electron , @xmath22 is the speed of the electrons close to the fermi surface , and @xmath23 is the nanoparticle diameter . the second term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : taueff ] takes into account the collision rate of the electron with the metal walls for spherically shaped particles .    in order to compare our predictions to previous experimental measurements , we identified multi - metal composites for which experimental observations of the plasmonic behavior are available including the three parameters required for the calculations , namely : ( i ) the average metal particle size ; ( ii ) the length of the sample which determines the absorption , and ( iii ) the composition of the metal particles . </S>",
    "<S> based on this , we compared theoretical predictions with the experiments of magruder and co - workers on _ ag and cu _ _ mixtures _ in sio@xmath0 @xcite , by battaglin and co - workers on _ au - cu alloys _ in sio@xmath0 @xcite and by moskovits and co - workers on _ colloidal solutions of au - ag alloy nanoparticles _ in h@xmath0o @xcite . in our calculations , the optical absorption in a silica glass or water matrix </S>",

    "<S> @xcite measured the behavior of the plasmonic peaks as a function of the volume fractions of the individual metals in a composite of ag and cu in sio@xmath0 . here , the various ratios of the metal ions were achieved by sequential ion implantation . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting composites had particles with a mean size of _ d = 30 _ nm for ag and cu in ratios of 9:3 , 6:6 , and 3:9 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the central observations were that : ( i ) a dominant peak , attributed to ag , shifts from ~410 nm to 440 nm as the ag concentration was increased ; and ( ii ) a second weak peak near ~575 nm appeared as the cu concentration increased . using the above values for the particle diameter and individual metal concentrations along with the experimental values for @xmath22 and @xmath21 for cu and ag we calculated the effective permittivity using the mixing rule developed above and estimated the plasmonic behavior of this system . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite ( symbols ) with the results of our predictions ( lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> the theory , without the use of any fitting parameters , predicts the position of the plasmon peaks as well as the shift occurring due to change in ag concentration . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations predicted a shift from 417 nm to 452 nm with increasing ag concentration . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation also accurately captured the appearance of the second peak at 572 nm with increasing cu concentration . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the widths of the individual peaks , which is extremely sensitive to particle size , were fairly well represented by our model . </S>",
    "<S> the peak widths were a consequence of the correction introduced to the electron scattering time based on the particle size .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : battaglin ] we compare model predictions with the data of battaglin et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in which the plasmonic behavior was studied as a function of alloy concentration and particle size for au - cu alloys in sio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> equal ratios of au and cu were implanted and then subjected to different annealing conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the as - deposited sample contained an alloy with au@xmath0cu@xmath30 composition ( with the remaining cu in atomic state ) and average particle size of @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the sample annealed in h@xmath0 had a au@xmath30cu@xmath32 alloy with an average particle size of @xmath33 while the sample annealed in air contained primarily au nanoparticles of @xmath34 diameter , with the cu preferentially found as an oxide in the near surface of the samples . </S>",
    "<S> for the theoretical calculations we first created the appropriate alloys using the mixing rule ( depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : schematic - of - mixing](b ) ) and then the final composite based on the volume fraction of the alloy and the experimentally assigned particle diameters . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : battaglin ] , with experimental data as symbols and theory as lines . </S>",
    "<S> once again the theory accurately predicts the peak positions and shift for this alloy system without the need for any fitting parameters .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : moskovits ] we compare the theoretically predicted and experimentally observed behavior of colloidal solutions containing au - ag core - shell nanoparticle alloys of various compositions in a water matrix , as measured by moskovits and co - workers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their primary conclusions were : ( i ) a single plasmon peak appeared for the core - shell structures and this peak shifted with changing au - ag concentration . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior was attributed to the formation of an alloy in the shell whose composition changed with varying au - ag fraction ; and ( ii ) the trend could be fitted by applying a multi - parameter fitting routine to obtain the best fit based on summation of lorentzian peaks . </S>",
    "<S> we applied our mixing rule to first create the appropriate alloy ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : schematic - of - mixing](b ) ) with the particle diameters taken from @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting theoretical behavior is shown as lines in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : moskovits ] . </S>",
    "<S> the theory again predicted quite well the shift in the position of the plasmon peak with varying alloy composition .    in conclusion , we have developed a self consistent technique to determine / predict the effective permittivity of ternary composites containing mixtures and/or alloy nanocomposites using the milton - bergman lower bound expression for two component composites . </S>",
    "<S> we have successfully tested our theory against previously studied experimental systems comprising mixtures of multi - metal nanoparticles and/or alloys of ag : au : sio@xmath0 , ag - cu : sio@xmath0 , and au - cu : h@xmath0o . </S>",
    "<S> this approach predicts quite accurately the peak position and shift of plasmonic behavior in these mixtures and alloys by utilizing experimentally available optical parameters @xcite and without the need for any fitting . </S>",
    "<S> this result clearly indicates that our mixing approach captures the essential physics of plasmonic behavior in these multi - component systems . </S>",
    "<S> this calculation can readily be extended for nanocomposites with more than three components . </S>",
    "<S> however , at this point , no experimental data exists to validate the calculations for such systems . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the shape of the plasmon peaks could also be fairly well reproduced by utilizing a simple correction to the relaxation time of the electrons that accounts for the enhanced scattering at the metal boundary as the particle size is reduced . </S>",
    "<S> this model allows for further corrections due to quantum confinement effects as the particle size gets reduced below the 10 nm size scale @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach could be of great value towards predicting optical properties in terms of plasmonic behavior as a function of volume fraction , particle size and alloy composition in multi - component mixtures and could guide the assembly of nanocomposites with tailored optical properties @xcite .    </S>",
