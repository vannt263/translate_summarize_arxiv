    "many of the most powerful insights in the study of fluid turbulence are rooted in the idea of an energy cascade where the chaotic process of transferring energy to smaller scales allows the small scales to become universal and independent of the details of the forcing mechanism at the large scales . however",
    ", careful examination of many small scale statistics in different flows has shown that the reality of turbulence is quite a bit more complicated .",
    "some statistics such as the scaling exponents of eulerian and lagrangian structure functions are nearly identical in different flows  @xcite .",
    "but other small scale statistics such as the coefficients in scaling laws  @xcite or the scalar derivative skewness  @xcite show dependence on the properties of the large scales up to the largest reynolds numbers measured .    a traditional approach to deal with dependence on the large scales",
    "has been to classify flows , and allow that there might be differences between categories of flows such as free shear flows ( jets , mixing layers , _ etc _ ) , wall bounded shear flows ( boundary layers , channel flows , _ etc _ ) , or isotropic turbulence ( wind tunnel grid turbulence or numerical simulations in a box with periodic boundary conditions , _ etc _ ) . a careful empirical comparison of statistics between different flows could then show which properties of the small scales are truly independent of the large scales .",
    "recent developments in experimental tools have allowed for the measurement of small scale lagrangian statistics  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to flows designed for eulerian measurements such as hot - wire anemometry , lagrangian measurements do not require large mean velocity in order to use taylor s frozen flow hypothesis .",
    "in fact the opposite is desired since small mean velocity allows a particle to be tracked in an observation volume for the longest possible time .",
    "this has led to significantly different flow designs for lagrangian measurements .",
    "many new flows have been introduced which have complex large scales and are difficult to place into traditional categories which were originally meant for flows designed for hot - wire anemometry .",
    "two widely used examples of flows with low mean velocity are counter rotating disks  @xcite and oscillating grids  @xcite .",
    "a yet newer generation of flows are currently under study including the random jet array  @xcite , corner stirred tank  @xcite , lagrangian exploration module ( lem ) , and radial acoustic jets which each have unique large scales .    initial work on lagrangian measurements in flows with complex large scales and a small mean velocity has primarily assumed that the small scale statistics of interest are independent of the large scale forcing of the flow .",
    "this assumption has been tested in several cases by thorough quantitative comparison of small scale statistics in different flows .",
    "comparison of acceleration probability distribution functions ( pdf ) in direct numerical simulations ( dns ) and counter rotating disk experiments are found to be flow independent  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the scaling exponents of the lagrangian structure functions have been compared between dns and experiment , and found to be in close agreement  @xcite .",
    "much more work is needed to determine the degree to which the large scales of different flows affect various lagrangian statistics .    however , there is a more direct way to evaluate whether the small scales in a flow are independent of the large scales : the small scale measurements can be conditioned on a measurement of the state of the large scales .",
    "two previous studies have shown strong dependence of the small scales of eulerian structure functions on the instantaneous velocity , which is dominated by the large scales .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite extensively study interactions between the large scales and inertial range scales in two high reynolds number wind tunnel flows .",
    "strong correlations between the large scales and the velocity structure functions are found at all length scales .",
    "they interpret this as being consistent with the correct application of kolmogorov theory with a fluctuating energy injection at the large scales .",
    "sreenivasan and dhruva  @xcite measured eulerian velocity structure functions from atmospheric boundary layer data for @xmath2 , some of the largest reynolds numbers ever measured .",
    "they find that the structure functions conditioned on the large scale velocity show a strong dependence , and they show that dns and grid turbulence measurements show almost no dependence .",
    "they attribute the dependence to large scale shear , and show how to remove the effect to improve power law scaling .",
    "there is evidence that other small scale statistics show conditional dependence on the large scales .",
    "the acceleration variance shows a strong dependence when it is conditioned on the large scale velocity  @xcite .",
    "one challenge in discussing interactions between large scales and small scales is the very non - universal nature of the large scales .",
    "each flow has a unique set of large scales , which may depend on time , geometry , or driving parameters .",
    "so it has been difficult to isolate the aspects of the large scale flow that are affecting the small scales .",
    "anisotropy is the aspect that is best understood .",
    "extensive work has identified persistent anisotropy at small scales even at very high reynolds numbers  @xcite , and analysis using spherical tensor decomposition has placed this problem on solid footing  @xcite . however ,",
    "this is not the only effect of the large scales . here",
    "we wish to distinguish two additional aspects of the large scales that are particularly important .",
    "inhomogeneity is the spatial variation of statistics .",
    "large scale intermittency is temporal fluctuations on time scales longer than the eddy turnover time , @xmath3 .",
    "both inhomogeneity and large scale intermittency often occur together in real flows , but are distinct properties since flows can be conceived that have each without the other . for example , a homogeneous turbulent flow in dns can have large scale intermittency by having the energy injection varied in time . in this paper",
    "we present a comprehensive set of measurements of the dependence of eulerian and lagrangian velocity structure functions conditioned on the large scale velocity .",
    "we use a flow between two oscillating grids which is relatively homogeneous in the central region , but has large inhomogeneity near the grids .",
    "this allows us to isolate the signatures of different properties of the large scales .",
    "we find clear signatures of inhomogeneity , but a significant part of the dependence of the structure functions on the large scale velocity seems to be the result of large scale intermittency . a better understanding of this dependence on non - universal large scales will help in the identification of universal statistics , and the comparison of different flows .",
    "this work is based on optically tracking passive tracer particles seeded in a turbulent flow agitated by two oscillating grids as shown in fig .",

    "turbulence was generated between two identical octagonal grids oscillating in phase in an octagonal plexiglas tank that is 1m@xmath5 1m@xmath5 1.5 m and filled with approximately 1,100 liters ( 300 gallons ) of filtered , degassed water .",
    "the grids have 8 cm mesh size , 36% solidity , and were evenly spaced from the top and bottom of the tank with a 56.2 cm spacing between grids and a 1 cm gap between grid and tank walls .",
    "the stroke was 12 cm peak to peak , powered by an 11 kw motor .",
    "a typical grid frequency was 3 hz , but was raised to 5 hz to investigate reynolds number dependence .",

    "particle density could greatly increase with the planned addition of two more cameras  @xcite .",
    "one difficulty of oscillating grid flows is that vibrations from the oscillatory drive can couple to the camera supports and degrade imaging accuracy .",

    "these data were acquired using 3d ptv ( particle tracking velocimetry ) measurements using two bassler a504k video cameras capable of 1280 @xmath5 1024 pixel resolution at 500 frames per second ( a data rate of approximately 625 mb per second per camera ) .",
    "recording such a high data rate is a significant technological hurdle .",
    "a typical system would store data in 4 gb of video ram , so that one run would last just 7 seconds before waiting approximately 7 minutes for the data to download to hard disk .",
    "we use an image compression circuit to threshold images in real - time so that only pixels above a user defined brightness limit are regarded as particle data and retained while the dark background pixels are discarded  @xcite .",
    "this technique produces a dynamic data compression factor of 100 - 1000 , which enables continuous data collection and storage to hard disk .",
    "our first implementation of the image compression circuits have faced two major challenges .",
    "first , the simple thresholding compression reduces particle center accuracy .",
    "however , particle finding accuracy is typically degraded by only 0.1 pixel , which is typically less than the uncertainty in particle finding from unthresholded images . secondly , because frame number information was created and recorded separately on each computer , any operating system delay can lead to frames lost and timing mismatch between the cameras . for the measurements in this paper ,",
    "frame number errors were corrected in post processing .",
    "updated versions of the image compression circuit have solved this problem by including camera frame number in the data stream the computers record .",
    "particles are illuminated using a 532 nm pulsed nd : yag laser with 50 w average power .",
    "the beam was expanded to create an illumination volume approximately 7 cm @xmath0 4 cm @xmath0 5 cm .",

    "a reasonable suspicion might be that the observed dependence is a kinematic correlation , meaning that particle pairs with large velocity may also have a large velocity difference simply because the same measurements are used in both cases .",

    "however , several lines of evidence indicate that kinematic correlation does not account for the majority of the dependence we observe .",
    "first , note that two independent random samples with identical gaussian distributions have a difference that is uncorrelated with the sum , so that the conditional dependence seen in fig  [ fig : sreenigraph_wo_sreeni_center ] would be flat .",
    "this remains true for velocity differences and sums from gaussian random fields .",
    "both of these results can be obtained by considering the joint pdf of the two samples , and then rotating 45 degrees to the coordinate system of sums and differences .",
    "because the samples are interchangeable , the sum and difference axes have to be principle axes of the joint gaussian pdf , and the conditional variance of the difference is independent of the sum .    of course , turbulent velocities are not joint gaussian . however , from the kinematic relations in the literature we have not been able to derive predictions for the conditional structure functions that we consider or for the correlation @xmath81 that would capture the main conditional dependence we see .",
    "to make an experimental estimate of the effect of kinematic correlations , we conditioned the velocity differences on several other quantities . for each particle pair",
    ", we calculated the longitudinal and transverse components of the average velocity of the particles , denoted @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively .",
    "we then conditioned the longitudinal structure functions on the longitudinal and transverse pair velocities instead of conditioning on the pair vertical velocity .",
    "the idea here is that while conditioning the longitudinal structure functions on the longitudinal component ( @xmath82 ) could have a kinematic correlation , conditioning on the transverse component ( @xmath84 ) should have no kinematic correlation .",
    "we found that conditioning on ( @xmath82 ) had a roughly 30% larger effect on the structure functions than conditioning on ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "conditioning on @xmath57 should have less kinematic correlation than conditioning on @xmath82 .",
    "so more than 70% of the effect remains unexplained by kinematic correlation .",
    "we conclude that while kinematic correlation may possibly make a significant contribution to the conditional dependence , the majority of the effect comes from the large scales .",
    "an immediate concern when discussing large scale effects is if the oscillating grid flow has a reynolds number insufficient for adequate scale separation , and it is this which leads to contamination of the small scale statics by the large scales .",
    "evidence points to large scale dependence not being caused by limited reynolds number .",
    "the comparison in fig .",
    "[ fig : sreenigraph sreeni_data_center ] shows that atmospheric boundary layer data  @xcite with very large reynolds number ( @xmath85 ) has nearly the same dependence on the large scales as our flow .",
    "increasing the reynolds number in our flow makes very little difference .",
    "additionally , all length scales collapse to nearly the same functional form indicating that limited separation of scales is not the primary factor . taken together ,",
    "these lead us to the conclusion that merely high reynolds number alone is not enough to create small scales that are statistically independent of the large scales .",
    "our flow is somewhat anisotropic .",
    "the ratio of vertical to horizontal velocity standard deviations is 1.5:1 in the center .",
    "the effects of large scale anisotropy on the small scales has been studied extensively  @xcite , but it is not a major factor in conditional dependence studied here .",
    "we have analyzed our data by averaging over particle pairs with all orientations , so when the structure functions are conditioned on a quantity with no preferred direction like the velocity magnitude ( figure  [ fig : sf2_rbins8_zvelbins15_rms_center 3hz ] ) there should be very little contribution from anisotropy .",
    "in fact , we find that the conditional dependence on velocity magnitude is even stronger than the dependence on the vertical velocity component .",
    "we also observe the conditional dependence remains when conditioned on other quantities without preferred directions like @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "we conclude that anisotropy of the large scales is not a significant cause of the conditional dependence we observe .",
    "sreenivasan and dhruva  @xcite attribute the strong conditional dependence of the eulerian structure functions on the large scale velocity to shear in the atmospheric boundary layer . in making this argument",
    ", they show an important piece of information in their figure 6 which shows conditioned structure functions in homogeneous turbulence from both dns and wind tunnel grid turbulence .",
    "the conditional statistics in these homogeneous and isotropic flows show no apparent dependence on the large scale velocity .",
    "however , we conclude that shear is not the fundamental property responsible in our flow since the oscillating grid flow has a much lower shear but produces much the same dependence on the large scale velocity .",
    "the mean velocity gradient normalized with the eddy turnover time is 1.2 in the center of our flow and we estimate it is in the range of 5 or greater for their atmospheric boundary layer data",
    ". there must be some other properties that exist in the shear flow , but also are important in our flow with small shear .",
    "our data clearly shows the role that inhomogeneity plays in the observed large scale dependence .",
    "our eulerian and lagrangian data near the grid in figs .",
    "[ fig : sreenigraph bottom 3hz ] and [ fig : lsreenigraph_wo_sreeni_bottom ] show that the structure functions depend greatly on the origin of the fluid being swept into the observation volume .",
    "fluid coming from energetic regions of the tank have larger structure functions than fluid coming from more quiescent regions .",
    "inhomogeneity is directly responsible for the shift of the minimum in fig .",
    "[ fig : sreenigraph bottom 3hz ] away from zero vertical velocity . in the center of the tank ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sreenigraph_wo_sreeni_center ] ) , the inhomogeneity is much smaller , but it could be responsible for part of the curvature since both fluid coming downward and fluid coming upward would be coming from more energetic regions symmetrically .",
    "however , inhomogeneity alone does not account for all of the large scale dependence observed .",
    "there is also a significant contribution from large scale intermittency , and it is possible that this is the dominant contribution in the center of the tank .",
    "large scale intermittency has been difficult to quantify .",
    "it can be defined as any temporal fluctuations in the large scales that occur on timescales longer than the eddy turnover time , @xmath3 .",
    "fernando and desilva @xcite show large scale intermittency can exist in an oscillating grid flow depending on boundary conditions .",
    "we have observed clear signatures of large scale intermittency in our flow .",
    "although we use their recommended boundary conditions , the velocity distribution in the center of the flow is slightly bimodal indicative of switching between two flow states .",
    "this effect is more prominent in preliminary data we took for grid spacings of 66 cm and 100 cm than it is in the data for 56.2 cm presented in this paper .",
    "our measurements show a dependence of the conditional structure functions on the large scale velocity that can not be fully attributed to inhomogeneity , and large scale intermittency appears to be the most likely cause .",
    "the clearest evidence for this comes from conditioning the structure functions on the horizontal components of the large scale velocity , @xmath86 and @xmath87 instead of on the vertical component , @xmath57 .",
    "the horizontal midplane ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 directions ) is much more homogeneous than the vertical axis ( z direction ) .",
    "yet , the structure functions conditioned on @xmath87 or @xmath86 show a large scale dependence that is only moderately smaller than for the @xmath57 condition ( 85% and 72% of the dependence seen in @xmath57 ) .",
    "if the inhomogeneous direction shows similar conditional dependence on the large scales as the homogeneous directions show , then it seems that a large part of the conditional dependence must come from fluctuations in the large scales , and not directly from inhomogeneity .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite attribute large scale intermittency as a crucial component of the large scale dependence they observe .",
    "more work is needed to isolate the effects of large scale intermittency on small scale statistics in turbulence .",
    "we have largely ignored considerations of power law scaling which has been a focus of much of the previous work on this subject .",
    "because of the relatively low reynolds number of our experiment , we can not make sensitive tests of scaling .",
    "however , our data provides a plausible picture about how the large scales should affect power law scaling .",
    "if the data in fig .  [ fig : sreenigraph_wo_sreeni_center ] collapses to a single curve , then the dependence of the conditional structure functions on @xmath24 and @xmath90 are separable and the large scale dependence will have no effect on the scaling exponents of unconditional structure functions . when this type of plot does not collapse as in figs .",
    "[ fig : sreenigraph bottom 3hz ] and  [ fig : lsreenigraph_wo_sreeni_bottom ] , then the power law scaling will be affected by the large scales .",
    "we study a flow between oscillating grids with 3d particle tracking and a novel real - time image compression system in order to quantify the effects of various properties of the non - universal large scales on the inertial range and small scales .",
    "we measured the mean and variance of the velocity as a function of distance from the grids .",
    "the oscillating grid motion has produced a weak mean flow as well as a region near the grid with high velocity variance that falls off quickly to a very homogeneous , lower velocity variance , region in the center .",
    "this profile has been key in the determination of the role of inhomogeneity .",
    "conditional statistics were employed in order to measure the large scale effects .",
