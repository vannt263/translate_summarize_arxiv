    "21 has a flat radio spectral index , and is highly polarized ( green  2000 ) . it is a 1.3  diameter plerion ( @xmath5  1.9  pc at a distance of 5.0  kpc ) in the radio , infrared , and in x - rays ( prior to ; becker and szymkowiak 1981 ) .",
    "early  observations ( slane  2000 ) revealed a low - surface brightness extended component interpreted as the missing snr shell . 21 shares similar properties to 3c 58 and ctb  87 , plerions having a spectral break at low frequencies and classified as plerions of the _ second kind _ ( woltjer  1997 ) .",
    "bock , wright , & dickel ( 2001 ) have however recently questioned the spectral break in 21 . in this paper , we highlight the  observations . more details about the analysis ( including  and observations ) and interpretation of our results can be found in safi - harb  ( 2001 ) .",
    "in fig .  1 , we show the   images of 21 in the soft and hard energy bands . with _",
    "rosat _ and previous radio observations , only the bright 40  radius core is detected .",
    "allowed the discovery of a faint extended component ( fig .  1 ,",
    "left ) making the snr at least twice as big as previously thought . in fig .  2 ,",
    "the hardness ratio map ( 2.410 kev over 0.52.4 kev ) shows that the central core is harder than the extended component ( in agreement with our spectral analysis below ) .",
    "moreover , the extended component is harder in the northern quadrant , with brighter knots and filamentary structures .",
    "we perform a spatially resolved spectroscopy of the plerion using a 72 ksec exposure with @xmath6 acis s3 .",
    "the spectrum of the inner core is extracted from a circle of radius @xmath7=40@xmath8 ( with rings of 5 \" thickness ) .",
    "for the extended component , we extract a spectrum from 50@xmath8150@xmath8 .",
    "all spectra are best described by a power law with the photon index , @xmath9 , steepening away from the bright center from 1.5 to 2.7 ( @xmath0=2.2@xmath110@xmath2  @xmath3 ) .",
    "we rule out thermal models for the extended component .",
    "collisional equilibrium ionization ( cei ) models , such as @xmath10 , yield poor fits ( @xmath11@xmath51.15 ) .",
    "non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) models , such as @xmath12 , are unlikely since they yield a very low ionization timescale , and an interstellar column density , @xmath0 , much lower than that derived for the snr ( table  1 ) .",
    "furthermore , we find no evidence of line emission from the filaments and knots .",
    "their spectra are well fitted with a power law model .",
    ".spectral parameters of the fits to the low - surface - brightness extended component using acis - s3 observations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the extended component is non - thermal  in agreement with observations ( warwick  2001 ) .",
    "the softening of the spectral index away from the core could be explained by synchrotron losses . unlike other plerions , 21 is the only candidate whose x - ray size is bigger than its radio size .",
    "deep radio observations ( recently performed with the vla ) will allow us to search for the radio counterpart of the extended x - ray component and the missing snr shell .",
    "since 21 is bright and heavily absorbed , a significant fraction of its flux would be scattered by dust ( r. smith , private communication ) .",
    "future work should include modeling a dust scattering x - ray halo .",
