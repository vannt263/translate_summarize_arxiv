    "the supersolid ( ss ) phase that simultaneously exhibits a superfluid ( sf ) phase and a density - wave order has been studied , since it was first proposed theoretically @xcite . although its existence is still controversial , a non - classical moment of inertia of solid @xmath0he in vycor glass that suggests its existence was recently reported @xcite .",
    "ss phases may also exist in optical lattices .",
    "cold atoms in optical lattices are new experimental systems in which theoretically modeled hamiltonians can be more distinctly simulated experimentally with no disorders .",
    "for instance , an optical lattice system , as described by a bose  hubbard model @xcite , distinctly showed the phase transition between the sf phase and the mott insulator ( mi ) phase @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent observations of the long - range dipole  dipole interaction in @xmath1cr atoms @xcite may lead to the realization of the ss phase .",
    "the simplest lattice model with a long - range interaction is the extended bose  hubbard model with a nearest - neighbor interaction : @xmath2 here @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 denote the transfer integral between nearest - neighbor sites , the repulsive intra - site interaction , and the repulsive inter - site interaction between nearest - neighbor sites , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath6 @xmath7 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator at the site @xmath8 . in this study",
    ", we assume that the lattice is bipartite and consists of sublattices @xmath9 and @xmath10 and that the number of nearest - neighbor sites is @xmath11 .",
    "the extended bose  hubbard model that prohibits ( allows ) multiple boson occupations at one site is called the hard - core ( soft - core)-extended hubbard model .",
    "several analytical and numerical methods exist for studying the ground state of the extended bose ",
    "hubbard model .",
    "the strong - coupling perturbation theory @xcite has been applied to obtain the phase boundary between the sf and non  sf phases .",
    "at least in the absence of the nearest - neighbor interaction @xcite , the phase boundary determined by this theory agrees perfectly with that determined by quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations @xcite .",
    "however , this theory can neither distinguish between the sf and ss phases nor describe discontinuous transitions even if they exist .",
    "in contrast , the mean field ( mf ) approximation and equivalent gutzwiller approximations @xcite can distinguish between the sf and ss phases and describe discontinuous transitions @xcite , although their validity is limited for high dimensions .",
    "for the hard - core model at half filling ( @xmath12 ) , both the mf approximation @xcite for the mapped xxz model and two - dimensional ( 2d ) qmc studies @xcite identified the first - order sf ",
    "solid transition and no ss phase .",
    "the mf approximation @xcite also showed that the transition from the sf phase to the checker - board solid phase is of the first order , and at the transition point @xmath13 , the ss phase ; solid phase ; and ps phase in which the ss phase and the solid phase coexistx are all degenerate .    on the other hand ,",
    "later qmc studies @xcite showed that the ss phase is unstable against ps away from half filling . for the soft - core model , both gutzwiller approximations @xcite and qmc simulations @xcite have shown that checker - board ss phases can be stable against the ps .",
    "however , the details of the two types of study differ .",
    "the gutzwiller studies showed stable ss phases for both broad filling and half filling , but the ps issue is not a concern in these cases .",
    "in contrast , the 2d qmc studies did not show the ss phase at half filling but identified ss phases above half filling ; however , the system energy as a function of boson density was found to be concave below half filling , which indicates a possible ps instability @xcite .",
    "a later 2d qmc study @xcite showed more distinctly that the ss phase is unstable against ps below half filling by exhibiting the negative compressibility @xmath14 .",
    "this situation is somewhat similar in one dimension ( 1d ) . both qmc",
    "@xcite and density - matrix renormalization group @xcite studies have been performed in 1d .",
    "the ss phase was found only above half filling as in the 2d case but ps did not occur @xcite .    in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) cubic lattice , yamamoto and coworkers @xcite found some region of the parameter sets where the ss phase is stable below half filling in qmc calculations , which is consistent with a mf phase diagram on the @xmath15@xmath16 plane for @xmath17 .",
    "hence , it is interesting to study the 3d system further .",
    "on the other hand , other previous calculations assumed a grand canonical ensemble and did not directly include the possibility that the system can be separated into two phases . as a result",
    ", the phases comprising the separate phases were not directly shown . however ,",
    "if we start with a canonical ensemble and explicitly include the possibility that the system can be separated into phases , we can precisely describe the phase diagram with a fixed boson number for the entire system .",
    "such calculations might also be easily considered using the grand canonical ensemble if we explicitly assume that the total free energy of the system is @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 is the ratio of the areas of the ss phases , and we neglect the surface energy between the ss and solid phases .",
    "however , if we minimize the free energy at the chemical potential @xmath20 , we can obtain only @xmath21 or 1 , but not an intermediate value @xmath22 except for @xmath13 at which the ss and solid phases are degenerate [ @xmath23 .",
    "that is , the solid and ss phases can not be in the ground state at the same time , and a separate phase including two states can not be obtained for @xmath24 . to obtain a separate phase , we must tune the chemical potential from @xmath20 to @xmath25 ; furthermore , we must try to find a @xmath19 that satisfies the boson number condition @xmath26 .",
    "these calculations become more complicated when the number of possible phases is large ( sf , ss , mi , and several solids ) .",
    "this issue , in which ps can be obtained only on the phase boundary point(s ) or curve(s ) in the phase diagram but not for a finite region , generally occurs when we employ intensive variable(s ) such as chemical potential in thermodynamics .",
    "the most popular case is the gas  liquid transition , where ps occurs only on the phase boundary curve in the pressure  volume plane for a given temperature .",
    "however , if we employ particle number , volume , and internal energy as thermodynamic variables , which are extensive quantities , we can obtain a finite region of pss on the particle density  energy density plane .",
    "in this study , we study the ground - state properties of the extended bose  hubbard model on a bipartite lattice based on the gutzwiller approximation in a canonical ensemble ; hence , we do not have to tune the chemical potential of ps .",
    "we study a wide parameter regime and present three main figures for the phase diagram on the particle density  nearest - neighbor interaction plane .",
    "our phase diagrams for small , intermediate , and large transfer integrals differ significantly .",
    "the other main topic is the solid order parameter @xmath27 [ @xmath28 : the boson density on the @xmath29 sublattice ] , which is also of interest and also depends strongly on the transfer integral .",
    "we employed the linear programming method @xcite to minimize the total energy for a particular boson number . following this method",
    ", we can simultaneously determine the ps region , the phases that comprise the separate phase , and the ratio of each phase to the entire system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows , section ii introduces our calculation method , and secs .",
    "iii and iv present the hard - core and soft - core bose ",
    "hubbard models , respectively .",
    "section v describes the effect of an improved calculation on the energy of the solid and mi phases .",
    "section vi discusses the conclusions based on our results .",
    "finally , the appendices explain the details of several perturbative calculations , the results of which are compared with the numerical results from the gutzwiller approximation .",
    "we employ the following gutzwiller approximation for the ss and sf phases : @xmath30 . here , @xmath31 is a variational wave function at the site @xmath8 .",
    "we assume a bipartite lattice with sublattices @xmath9 and @xmath10 and a checker - board symmetry for the ss phase .",
    "the variational wave function is assumed to be @xmath32 if the site @xmath8 belongs to the @xmath29 sublattice .",
    "@xmath33 is written as a linear combination of states @xmath34 with @xmath35 bosons as @xmath36 .",
    "the variational parameters @xmath37 are determined so as to minimize the energy expectation value .",
    "we use powell s method @xcite to numerically optimize the variational parameters . if the result of the optimization shows @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the phase is ss ; however , if @xmath40 , the phase is sf ( @xmath8 and @xmath41 are non - negative and positive integers , respectively ) .",
    "the first inequality for the ss phase corresponds to the existence of a finite density difference between sublattices @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath42 ( i.e. , the checker - board density order ) . here",
    "@xmath43 is the expectation value of the boson density at the @xmath29 sublattice .",
    "the second inequality implies that the phase is not solid . for the soft - core model , in principle , the sum of @xmath35 must be taken from @xmath44 to @xmath45 ; however , we take the sum from @xmath44 to @xmath46 , which is sufficient for our calculation when @xmath47 . for the hard - core model , by definition , we consider only the two states @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the energy expectation value per site is calculated by the gutzwiller variational wave function as @xmath50 furthermore , we assume that the energy per site of the mi phase with @xmath15 bosons per site is @xmath51 and that of the solid phase with @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) bosons per site on the @xmath9(@xmath10 ) sublattice is @xmath54 where @xmath28 is a non - negative integer . in particular , for the solid phase when @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( the s@xmath57 phase ) , @xmath58 ; for the solid phase when @xmath59 and @xmath56 ( the s@xmath60 phase ) , @xmath61 .",
    "these energies correspond to those obtained from the gutzwiller variational wave function with @xmath62 for the mi phase and @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) for the solid phase . because we neglect the surface energy between different phases by assuming the thermodynamic limit , the system s total energy per site is @xmath66 for the boson number condition @xmath67 here @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( where @xmath70 , ss , mi , and solids ) are the energies and boson number densities , respectively , of all possible phases and @xmath71 represent the of area or volume ratio of the phase @xmath8 in the entire system . following the linear programming method @xcite",
    ", we can minimize @xmath72 as a function of @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "only one @xmath73 value ( corresponding to the uniform phase ) or two @xmath73 values ( corresponding to ps ) are automatically chosen to be nonzero as a result of minimizing @xmath72 because only one additional condition , the boson number condition , exists .",
    "for simplicity , however , we neglect the possibility of the separated phase that splits into the sf and ss phases , which is highly unlikely . hereafter , we represent the separated phase consisting of phases x and y as the ps(x + y ) phase .",
    "in the hard - core - extended hubbard model , we prohibit multiple occupations at a site and define the gutzwiller variational wave function as @xmath74 at half filling , @xmath75 according to the normalization condition of the wave function , and @xmath76 according to the boson number condition .",
    "if we set @xmath77 , then @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "hence , the system energy per site is @xmath80.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath81 , then @xmath82 or @xmath83 and the phase is s@xmath57 ; however , if @xmath84 , then @xmath85 and the phase is sf .",
    "hence , the sf",
    " s@xmath57 phase transition occurs at @xmath86 and is discontinuous .",
    "this result agrees with those of previous studies @xcite .",
    "away from half filling , we can obtain the sf  ss phase boundary by a perturbative calculation setting @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the optimized value when we assume the sf phase ( @xmath89 ) and @xmath90 represents infinitesimal quantities that describe the possible ss instability ( see appendix a.1 for details ) .",
    "the result is @xmath91 that is , the energy of the ss phase is lower ( higher ) than that of the sf phase for @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "@xmath94 is invariant under @xmath95 because of the particle  hole symmetry of the hard - core model .",
    "we also obtain the phase boundary between the sf phase and the ps(sf + s@xmath57 ) phase , which consists of the sf and the s@xmath57 phases by another perturbative calculation , assuming that the ratio of the s@xmath57 phase to the entire system is infinitesimal ( see appendix a.2 for details ) .",

    "we numerically compared the energy of the ss and ps(sf + s@xmath57 ) phases by using the gutzwiller variational wave function as explained in the introduction .",
    "we found that the ps(sf + s@xmath57 ) and ss phases are degenerate for @xmath92 within the numerical error . the phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "1 . the numerical phase boundary agrees with eq .",
    "[ perturbation1 ] within the numerical error and the phase transitions are continuous as the perturbative calculation assumed",

    "we also confirmed that both @xmath96 ( the ratio of the s@xmath57 phase ) in the ps(sf + s@xmath57 ) phase and @xmath27 in the ss phase are finite for @xmath92 [ figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) ] .",
    "as @xmath15 approaches @xmath97 , @xmath96 increases rapidly as a function of @xmath98 , because at half filling , no ss phase occurs and the sf ",

    ", we primarily examine the ss phase at half filling .",
    "we compare the critical value of @xmath5 for the ss ",
    "s@xmath57 transition with that of the sf  ss transition because if the former is larger than the latter , we can obtain the ss phase between the sf and s@xmath57 phases .    by a perturbative calculation with an infinitesimal ss component added to the s@xmath57 phase",
    ", we obtain the critical value of @xmath5 for the ss  s@xmath57 transition by a power - law expansion of @xmath100 : @xmath101 ( see appendix b.1 for details ) .",

    "we verified these results numerically .",
    "figure 3 shows the phase boundaries obtained by the above - mentioned perturbative calculations ( dashed and dot - dashed curves ) and the full numerical calculations ( solid curves ) .",
    "a stable ss phase appears between the sf and s@xmath57 phases .",
    "both the ss ",
    "s@xmath57 and sf  ss phase boundaries determined by perturbative calculations agree well with those determined by the full numerical calculations ( especially at small @xmath100 as expected ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the interaction dependence of @xmath27 . here , @xmath105 is the critical value for the sf  ss transition at each value of @xmath100 .",
    "a finite @xmath106 less than unity shows the density order of the ss phase , whereas @xmath107 corresponds to the sf(s@xmath57 ) phase .",
    "we found that @xmath106 continuously becomes finite at the sf  ss phase transition .",
    "it changes more rapidly for smaller @xmath100 .",
    "this demonstrates that the ss phase disappears and the sf - s@xmath57 discontinuous transition occurs in the hard core limit @xmath108 .",
    "on the other hand , 2d qmc calculations at half filling @xcite showed that the sf phase directly transitions to the s@xmath57 phase and no ss phase appears .",
    "however , @xmath100 might not be sufficiently large to allow the ss phase to be easily found there , and a qmc simulation ( as a matter of course , not only 2d but also 3d ) for a large @xmath100 has a possibility for finding the ss phase .      in this section , for comparison with the results of the full numerical calculations ,",
    "we calculate the results of the following three perturbative equations for the phase boundary ( see appendices a , b.2 , and b.3 for details ) .",
    "perturbation 1 is eq .",

    "we employ a limited hilbert space with @xmath111 , where @xmath112 , 1 , and 2 .",
    "hence , results obtained by perturbations 2 and 3 are expected to be better than those obtained by perturbation 1 .",
    "however , perturbations 2 and 3 require a numerical calculation to minimize the sf energy in the limited hilbert space .",
    "we begin by analyzing the phase diagram for a small transfer integral @xmath100 .",
    "figure 5(a ) shows the phase diagram for @xmath113 , which resembles that of the hard - core model .",
    "namely , the upper bound of @xmath114 for the sf phase has a minimum value near half filling , which is similar to that of the hard - core model with particle - hole symmetry .",
    "ps occurs for large @xmath114 below half filling , and the separated phase is the ps(sf + s@xmath57 ) phase , as in the hard - core model .",
    "however , the ss phase appears above half filling .",
    "these properties agree with those obtained in a 2d qmc study with @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "figure 5(a ) plots the result of perturbation 1 ( dot - dashed curve ) .",
    "it agrees almost perfectly with the full numerical calculation ( solid curve ) except at large @xmath15 where the sf  ss phase boundary disappears because the ps(ss + s@xmath60 ) phase appears there [ see also fig .",

    "5(a ) around @xmath116 .",
    "both perturbation 2 for the sf  ss boundary curve and perturbation 3 for the sf  ps(sf",

    "therefore , they also agree almost exactly with the full numerical calculations except at large @xmath15 .    figure 5(b ) shows that pss also appear above half filling but the region is very small compared to that obtained by 2d qmc @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the ps(ss + s@xmath60 ) phase and the intricate structure of the phase diagram are non - trivial ; however , the two ss phases that sandwich the ps(ss + s@xmath60 ) phase have different characteristics : one having a smaller zv / u resembles the sf phase and the other having a larger zv / u resembles the s@xmath60 phase , as we will see below through @xmath117 .",
