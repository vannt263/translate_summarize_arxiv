    "a method that has become standard  @xcite is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](c ) : straight lines are continued from each backbone terminus to the same point on a sphere surrounding the curve ( we refer to this as _ sphere closure _ ) . each point on the closure sphere gives a closed curve of specific knot type , which may be the ` unknot ' , equivalent to the trivial circle .",

    "an advantage of this new method is that it allows a more subtle refinement of the knot distribution associated with an open curve , as the inclusion of virtual knots can better capture the conformations of backbones where tangling is evident but no single knot type dominates .",

    "we will present results on knotting in terms of the fractions of directions giving different knot types under sphere or virtual closure .",
    "[ fig : fig2 - 2](a)-(b ) demonstrate this structure for an example protein chain , by colouring the sphere according to the knot types found in each direction from both of the closure methods , while ( c ) and ( d ) show the same results in an ( area - preserving ) mollweide projection of the sphere area such that its entire surface is visible ; this projection is preferred in later figures . in the sphere closure map ( c ) , many of points are unknotted ( grey ) , yet 59% give a trefoil knot @xmath3 , which therefore dominates and so this backbone was determined by @xcite to be @xmath3 knotted .",
    "the smaller islands where closures form more complex knots make up less than 7% of the sphere area . in the corresponding virtual closure map ( d ) ,",
    "the virtual knot @xmath24 is associated with much of the area identified as @xmath7 or @xmath3 in ( c ) , now appearing in 54% of different projections .",
    "this curve therefore has strong virtual character , and its virtual knot type reflects the ambiguity of the open curve between the unknot and trefoil knot .",
    "we now present the results of our survey of knotting in the protein data bank ( pdb )  @xcite , using both sphere closure and virtual closure . following the methodology of the knotprot database  @xcite",
    ", we constructed a minimal set of distinct chains from the 121,532 structures recorded in the pdb , analysing only each sequence unique chain in a given protein and rejecting chains containing artefacts .",
    "we additionally restrict attention to chains that have not been made obsolete by more recent measurements .",
    "the pdb records for some of the remaining proteins have broken chains ( where the chain conformation is uncertain ) , which we close with straight lines .",
    "this gives a total of 159,518 protein chains for analysis .",
    "for each chain , we close / project to 100 different points on the sphere ( approximately uniformly distributed following the method of  @xcite ) , considered sufficient for reasonable numerical confidence at acceptable computational cost  @xcite .",
    "the sphere closure analysis of knotprot found 946 knotted chains , including 871 trefoil ( @xmath3 ) knots , 45 occurrences of @xmath25 , 27 of @xmath6 and 3 of @xmath26 ( at time of comparison : sep 16 ) .",
    "our corresponding analysis gives instead @xmath27 knotted chains , including 894 of @xmath3 , 48 of @xmath25 , 27 of @xmath6 and 3 of @xmath26 , but does include all but one of the knotprot - identified chains , leaving 27 additional knot detections .",
    "these discrepancies appear to arise from small differences in methodology , particularly in rare occasions where very severe chain breaks are present ; 17 of our extra detections are considered knotted by one or both of the alternative protein knots databases pknot  @xcite , or protein knots  @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider that our sphere closure methodology accurately detects protein knotting for the purpose of comparison with virtual closure .    in the above results ,",
    "the knot associated with an open chain is the most common single knot type occurring over sphere closure in different directions ( i.e.  the modal average ) .",
    "although this methodology is natural , this can miss certain interesting cases ; for instance , a chain closing in different directions to 40% unknot , 30% @xmath3 and 30% @xmath25 would be considered unknotted , despite giving some knot for the majority of closure directions .",
    "such cases are much more frequent under virtual closure , as many more knot types are possible , and the resulting maps are correspondingly more complex as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 - 2 ] .",
    "we therefore introduce new classes of knotting associated with open chains , based on the definition that an open chain is _ unknotted _ only if it appears to be @xmath7 in over 50% of closure directions ; it is otherwise considered knotted , in some sense . for sphere closure ,",
    "if a single ( nontrivial ) knot type occurs in at least 50% of directions we call this _ strongly knotted _ , while if the sum of different nontrivial knot types occurs for at least 50% of directions , but no single type does , we call this _",
    "weakly knotted_. this does not significantly affect the 972 protein knots discussed above ; almost all ( 968 ) are strongly knotted by these definitions , with 7 further chains being weakly knotted .",
    "the choice of threshold at 50% is somewhat arbitrary , and the number of curves identified as unknotted rises ( falls ) as it is increased ( decreased ) .        under virtual closure",
    ", the different projections may include a mixture of virtual and classical knot types .",
    "we refine the distinction of strong and weak knotting to distinguish some major categories of knot character , calling a chain _ strongly classically ( virtually ) knotted _ where a single classical or virtual knot type appears in more than 50% of virtual closures from different projection directions ( e.g. strongly trefoil knotted or strongly @xmath28 knotted ) .",
    "a chain is instead _ weakly classically ( virtually ) knotted _ if no knot type is so individually common , but a combination of different classical ( virtual ) knot types alone contributes to over 50% of projection directions ( e.g. 30% @xmath29 , 30% @xmath24 and 40% @xmath7 is weakly virtually knotted ) . in all other cases ,",
    "no specific classification dominates , and we call the curve _ weakly totally knotted_. all of these weak classes represent knots with significant topological character that is not consolidated in forming a single deep knot . examples of protein chains according to these classifications are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3_1](a)-(d ) , and the identifications may vary significantly from the results obtained by sphere closure : ( a ) is strongly classically knotted according to both analyses ; ( b ) was unknotted on sphere closure but is strongly virtually ( @xmath24 ) knotted on virtual closure ; ( c ) was strongly @xmath3 knotted on sphere closure but is weakly virtually knotted on virtual closure ; and ( d ) was strongly @xmath3 knotted on sphere closure but on virtual closure is weakly totally knotted .",
    "altogether we find 1258 protein chains falling into one of these topological classes , 283 more than in our sphere closure analysis .",
    "the mix of their different classifications is summarised in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3_1](e ) . as with the sphere closure analysis , most of these protein chains",
    "are strongly classically knotted ( 727 cases , all of which were also strongly classically knotted under sphere closure , and mostly the knot @xmath3 ) , and weak classical knotting is still negligible ( 2 cases , 7 under sphere closure ) .",
    "strong virtual knotting is much less common , occurring in 41 cases , 30 previously considered unknotted under sphere closure .",
    "these are cases where two classical knot types compete with comparable area contribution under sphere closure , and in all but one case the competition is between @xmath7 and @xmath3 ; the virtual knots are therefore strongly @xmath24 knotted ( the remaining example is @xmath30 between classical types @xmath7 and @xmath6 ) .    the remaining protein chains are weakly knotted in some form ; 343 are weakly virtually knotted ( around a third of which were not topologically interesting under sphere closure ) , and 145 are weakly totally knotted ( most of which were dominated by a classical knot under sphere closure ) .",
    "the new detections here represent curves that can not be easily identified with a single classical knot type because their conformations are similar to multiple classical knots .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3_1](c ) , whose knot types under sphere closure suggest little of the complexity evident in its virtual closure map ; this feature is typical of the weak virtual knots , which for this reason include most of the new chains that appeared unknotted under sphere closure .",
    "these knots may be interpreted as being rather shallow , as small modifications to the chain can relatively significantly affect the maps .",
    "the weakly totally knotted chains are similar but with the classical knots a little deeper in the chain , as in the example of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3_1](d ) , where the clarity of the chain s trefoil knot character is muted but not removed under virtual closure .",
    "these various classifications of strong and weak knots form a loose way of capturing the forms of knotting and tangling exhibited in protein backbone curves , with physical implications for the depth of the knots in the chain .",
    "the distribution of these classes is uneven amongst the protein chains ; for instance , all 46 examples of @xmath25 under sphere closure remain strongly @xmath25 knotted under virtual closure , suggesting consistently small virtual character .",
    "knotting is also not equidistributed amongst different protein classes : fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3_1](f ) shows a breakdown of the the different classes of knotted open chain by protein chain name , for families in which knotting has previously been observed to cluster  @xcite , as well as families where new virtual character appears .",
    "virtual knotting appears significant amongst carbonic anhydrases , in which the knots are known to be rather shallow , and all knots found under virtual closure also appear under sphere closure .",
    "in contrast , the virtual knots amongst synthases are almost all newly identified , with previously discovered strong classical knots being deep enough to remain unchanged by the analysis .",
    "further , the families of hydroxylases and gallate dioygenases contain several examples of virtual knotting , and neither family showed any evidence of knotting under sphere closure .",
    "it is unsurprising that the levels of topological complexity are consistent among members of the same protein families , as they arise from consistent features in their secondary and tertiary structures , but it is important that virtual knotting has its own distribution among protein chain names , distinct from that of classical knotting .",
    "the virtual closure technique for describing knotting is applicable to any open space curve , but the the presence of virtual knots relies on particular geometric characteristics of the curve .",
    "it is unclear if proteins express these in a generic fashion , or if virtual knotting is a particularly good ( or bad ) descriptor of their backbone chains , and for comparison we perform a preliminary analysis by sphere closure and virtual closure for other families of random open curves .",
    "these are drawn from two statistical ensembles : open random walks , and open subchains of hamiltonian walks on a cubic lattice . in order to investigate the new information provided by virtual knotting we use a simplification of the scheme in the previous section , considering an open curve as ` knotted ' if over 50% of directions yield a knot on sphere closure ( i.e. either strong or weak classical knotting ) , and ` virtually knotted ' if over 50% of projection directions are virtually knotted ( i.e. either strong or weak virtual knotting ) .",
    "virtual closure is a useful technique for ensembles where the virtual knotting probabilities are comparable to or higher than closure knotting probabilities , otherwise most curves will take the same strong knot type under both analyses .",
    "the main parameter against which knotting is compared is _ closing distance fraction _",
    "( cdf)the distance between the curve s endpoints divided by its total length  which varies from 0 for a closed loop , to 1 for a straight line .",
    "random walks consist of a sequence of random linear steps , whose limiting , long - length statistical behaviour is that of brownian motion .",
    "their geometry and topology is quite well understood ; for sufficiently long walks , the statistics are independent of the specific model , tending towards the characteristic brownian fractal behaviour  @xcite .",
    "the probability of knotting in closed random walks has been well investigated  @xcite .",
    "random walks tend not to be a good model for proteins , but nevertheless are good models for other physical systems  @xcite , and are a convenient comparison model for knotting of open chains in the absence of physical constraints .",
    "[ fig : rws](a ) shows the statistics of knotting upon sphere and virtual closure for a set of random walks with 100 steps generated via the method of  @xcite , with inset showing a sample random walk .",
    "the advantage of this particular ensemble is that the cdf can be directly controlled , but for all distances knotting is significantly more common than virtual knotting ( this is most probable around a cdf of 0.025 , where about 5% of the random walks are virtually knotted , but even at this value classical knotting is at least 3.5 times as common ) .",
    "this qualitative result appears to hold for random walks of very different lengths ( not shown ) .",
    "these results are not surprising as knots in random walks can easily be small , localised deep within the chain .",
    "this contrasts strongly with the equivalent results for proteins , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rws](b ) , which combine all protein chains from the previous section despite their backbones being of many different lengths ( from tens to thousands of angstroms and up to @xmath313300 carbon atoms in the backbone chain ) .",
    "the comparatively small number of protein chains mean the statistics are only useful for qualitative comparison .",
    "nevertheless , virtual knotting appears far more likely relative to classical knotting , possibly becoming more dominant around a cdf of 0.025 .    unlike random walks",
    ", protein backbones are characterised by relatively compact geometries ( such as the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : rws](b ) ) , and aspects of this this can be reproduced by simple mathematical models of random chains . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rws](c ) , we give the results for one such model : a subchain of a hamiltonian walk  @xcite , that is , a path on a cubic lattice of fixed size , visiting every vertex once and every edge no more than once .",
    "such curves form a confined , folded structure due to the strict boundaries of the finite lattice .",
    "the geometry and topology of proteins are best approximated when the hamiltonian segment is much shorter than this , such that the lattice confinement is not strong , and random lattice walks of this type can be efficiently generated up to lattice side lengths of at least 10  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : rws](c ) shows the knotting and virtual knotting sampled from @xmath32 random hamiltonian subchains with length 75 on a cubic lattice of side length 6 , with these parameters chosen to approximate the knotting probabilities in fig .",
    "[ fig : rws](b ) . here",
    "the virtual knotting is strong relative to closure knotting , comparable to proteins but very unlike random walks , and the probability of virtual knotting exceeds that of classical knotting across the small range @xmath33 cdf @xmath34 .",
    "this trend appears to be highly robust to different parameters ; even if the lattice is saturated , such that knots are very common , virtual knotting exceeds classical knotting over approximately the same range .",
    "these results emphasise that virtual knotting is a generic feature of certain geometrical classes of curves , arising from relatively weak geometric constraints even in the absence of the physical complexity of protein chains .",
    "we have shown that the backbones of protein chains , as well as other open curves , can be described topologically in terms of virtual knotting . through the method of virtual closure of projections ,",
    "open chains are found to have a much wider set of topological classes than the classical knots in closed curves , and we have found many examples of different virtual knot types , in projections of protein chains .",
    "nevertheless , virtual knotting dominates relatively few proteins , and the virtual knot types which do occur are only a small fraction of the possible virtual knots . in some cases",
    "this can be thought of as representing a more nuanced characterisation of ` almost ' knotted curves , softening the binary distinction between knotting and unknotting imposed by traditional closure methods . in the analysis of proteins",
    "the most dominant virtual class is the weak virtual knots , where no single knot type is most prevalent but less than 50% of projected diagram directions are unknotted .",
    "these curves are the most topologically ambiguous , and can not be associated with a definite knot type .",
    "protein chains express several geometrical properties that might be expected to encourage virtual knotting : as they fold they curve and twist into relatively small , chemically bound structures such that their projections have many crossings ; the endpoints of the protein backbone are often within or near the surface of the structure , such that projections in different directions produce distinctly different knot diagrams ; and the physical limits on their curvature and overall tangling mean that knots are rarely unambiguous local structures but inherently involve the entire protein chain .",
    "this is not true for random walks , and indeed virtual knotting was found to be less significant in them , although hamiltonian subchains , which do have some of these properties , were found to be particularly strongly virtually knotted .",
    "we expect that virtual knotting analysis will be most relevant in other systems of open curves with compact configurations . a mechanism that might encourage virtual knots in physical systems is tight confinement , such as that of a curve confined within a sphere ( e.g.  dna within a viral capsid  @xcite ) but also between less confining barriers such as adjacent planes  @xcite , which might privilege certain projection directions .    under the virtual closure analysis",
    ", a single chain can project to many different classical and virtual knot types , which we have summarised by emphasising ` strong ' dominating single knot types , or the ` weak ' classes of mixed classical and virtual knot types .",
    "although this captures some differences in the tangling of open curves , it ignores the rich structure of knot types in the projected map , other details of which may be necessary to understanding the 3d spatial conformation of the open chain . including virtual knots may be important to understand these maps , not only because the number of possible types is increased , but also because they generally occur in between classical knot types ( seen clearly in figs  [ fig : fig2 - 2 ] and  [ fig : fig3_1](b)-(d ) ) , even in chains which are mostly unknotted . this extra discriminatory ability would be useful in any classification of open curve geometry according to these deeper projection correlations , and could also apply to any investigation of topological character over time in dynamic systems , capturing the intermediate stages between unknotting and unambiguous classical knotting .",
    "although we have focused our discussion on the statistics of virtual knotting in protein backbone chains , the analysis only requires that the curves are open - ended ; virtual closure is a refinement rather than an alternative to existing methods of analysing knotting in open curves , and can be applied anywhere in place of sphere closure of the open chain .",
    "this could include other aspects of protein knotting , such as slipknotting in which knots appear in subsections of the curve before disappearing as the rest of the curve ` unthreads ' itself  @xcite .",
    "many examples of slipknotting have been found in proteins  @xcite , and tracking the knot type across subchains of the full protein backbone produces a slipknotting fingerprint .",
    "extending these methods to include virtual knots via virtual closure would be natural , as virtual knots would typically occur at transitions between different classical knot types .",
    "the methodology also can be further extended , for example to systems of multiple open curves under similar average closures which extend in the same fashion to the theory of virtual links ( and potentially to a wider class of virtual knot types ) , and may even extend to other knot - like objects such as protein lassos  @xcite .",
    "* knot detection by sphere closure of open curves . * for each open chain ( here , a protein backbone or random walk ) , each direction ( point on a sphere around the curve ) is associated with a type of knot . for the sphere closure analysis ,",
    "the endpoints of the open curve are closed by extending them ` to infinity ' in this direction , giving a closed curve of a specific classical knot type . in practice",
    ", the 3d chain is projected in the plane perpendicular to this direction , then the diagram closed with a straight line that passes _ over _ every intervening arc of the diagram .",
    "each open curve is projected and analysed in 100 approximately uniformly distributed closure directions , chosen using the algorithm of  @xcite .",
    "previous work has verified that 100 closure directions is usually sufficient to determine the significant statistical behaviour of closures in different directions  @xcite , and so alternative approximately - uniform samplings should reproduce the same statistics . for each projection",
    ", the resulting knot diagram is algorithmically simplified using reidemeister moves ( see supplementary note 1 ) , then the knot type identified through the calculation of knot invariants as described in the main text .",
    "the invariant used is the modulus of the alexander polynomial , @xmath35 , evaluated at each of @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , computed using a standard scheme  @xcite .",
    "the alexander polnomial is used because it can be calculated in polynomial time in the number of crossings of a knot diagram ( more discriminatory invariants are harder to calculate ) , but it is still sufficient to distinguish unambiguously knots with up to at least 8 crossings ; more complex knots may have invariants taking the same values , but these complex conformations are rare and never dominate in protein chains ( for instance , the next knot with the same alexander polynomial as the trefoil knot @xmath3 has 13 crossings , and no simpler knot agrees at the roots of unity we consider either ) . for simple knots this choice of three evaluation values is just as discriminatory as the full alexander polynomial , but more convenient for numerical calculation .    * knot detection by virtual closure of open curves .",
    "* for the virtual closure analysis of open curves , the selection of projection directions proceeds according to the above method , but the projected diagram in a given direction is closed instead with virtual crossings and simplified algorithmically using both classical and virtual reidemeister moves ( see supplementary note 1 ) .",
    "the same 100 projection directions are used ( and 100 directions appear sufficient to distinguish knot types as in the sphere closure analysis ) .",

    "classical knot theory deals with embeddings of the circle , @xmath47 ( i.e.  closed , non - intersecting curves ) , in three - dimensional space @xmath48 .",
    "any given embedding has a distinct _ knot type _ , which is invariant under ambient isotopies ( it may change only when the curve passes through itself ) .",
    "it is usual to represent knots using a 2-dimensional planar _ knot diagram _ , which can be thought of as a plane projection of the three - dimensional space curve , annotated with the extra information of which strand passes over the other at each self - intersection of the diagram ( called a _ crossing _ ) .",
    "all the information about the three - dimensional knot type is contained in such a diagram , and smooth deformations ( i.e.  ambient isotopies ) of the three - dimensional space curve lead to smooth isotopies of the knot diagram , which may change the configuration of the crossings . in two - dimensional knot diagrams ,",
    "the changes are represented by combinations of _ reidemeister moves _ as in supplementary fig .  [",
    "fig : supp_fig_1](a ) ; applying these local moves in conjunction with _",
    "planar isotopies _ of the knot diagram can transform between any two diagrammatic representations of the same knot , and equivalently any ambient isotopy of a closed three - dimensional space curve is corresponds to a combination of planar isotopies and reidemeister moves in any projection of the knot .",
    "the standard tabulations of knots , in _ knot tables _ as discussed in the main text , are ordered according to their _ minimal crossing number _ @xmath0  the smallest number of crossings a diagram of the knot can have .",
    "for instance , the trivial circle can be projected to a plane without self intersection ( i.e.  no crossings ) , and so has minimal crossing number @xmath10 and is labelled @xmath7 .",
    "there are no knots with @xmath11 , and one with @xmath4 , the trefoil knot , denoted @xmath3 .",
    "the labelling @xmath1 continues , where @xmath2 is an arbitrary index amongst knots with the same @xmath0 .",
    "these labels are standard , following original tabulations up to @xmath49 published over 100 years ago , with more recent extensions using consistent indices  @xcite .",
    "some simple knots from these tabulations are shown in fig .",
    "@xmath7 ( the _ unknot _ ) , then @xmath3 , @xmath25 , etc .",
    "the knots appearing in knot tables are _ prime knots _ ; _ composite knots _ , made up of two or more prime knots tied in the same curve , are also possible and are tabulated according to the composition of their prime factors  @xcite .",
    "all the tools of knot theory apply equally to composite knots , but they do not occur significantly in any known protein chain , and are not considered further here .",
    "it is natural to follow the curve of a knot , which endows an _ orientation _ to the knot ( choosing an orientation is an arbitrary choice that does not affect the results of topological calculations ) . observing the relative orientation of the strands at a crossing",
    "determines the _ sign _ of the crossing , either positive or negative .",
    "a crossing has the same sign even if the curve s orientation is reversed .",
    "the minimal diagram of a figure-8 knot @xmath25 has two positively signed crossings and two negatively signed , and in fact is isotopic to its mirror image . on the other hand , all three crossings of the minimal trefoil knot @xmath3 have the same sign , and are all reversed on its mirror image .",
    "knots such as the trefoil are thus _ chiral knots _ , and this chirality not directly represented in the tabulation ( i.e.  there are two enantiomeric trefoil knots which can not be be smoothly deformed into one another ) .",
    "other chiral knots are @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath26 in fig .",
    "2(a ) of the main text ; the others are achiral .",
    "we do not distinguish between chiral knot pairs in our analysis , although knot invariant quantities such as used to distinguish knots below could be used to do so .",
    "in practice the knot type of a space curve is determined as follows .",
    "first the curve is projected to a 2d knot diagram , which contains all the topological information in its ordered set of signed crossings along the curve .",
    "several topological notations representing this information are standard  @xcite ; we use below the _ gauss code _",
    ", constructed from an arbitrary starting point and orientation for the curve . as each new crossing",
    "is encountered along the curve , it is labelled @xmath50 in order as it is encountered .",
    "the gauss code is the ordered list of these crossing numbers as they occur along the curve , together with whether the curve passes over or under the intersecting strand , represented by using a positive number in the former case and negative in the latter ( this is not the same as the crossing sign ) ; each crossing must be encountered exactly twice before reaching the original starting point , once positive and once negative .",
    "for instance , a gauss code for a minimal diagram of the trefoil knot @xmath3 is @xmath51 , and for a minimal figure-8 knot @xmath25 is @xmath52 .",
    "it is obvious that changing the starting point on the curve cyclically permutes the crossings encountered , but all the gauss codes obtained this way , or by changing numeric labels ( as long as each crossing retains a unique label ) represent the same knot diagram .",
    "the gauss code written in this way also does not specify the chirality of the original three - dimensional curve , this information is contained in the local twisting of the two strands around one another and is sometimes included in extended gauss code notations .",
    "crossings which can be removed by reidemeister moves i and ii can be easily identified in a gauss code ; if crossing @xmath53 occurs adjacent to itself , @xmath54 then it can be removed by reidemeister move i , and if @xmath55 ( or @xmath56 ) , then crossings @xmath57 can be removed by reidemeister move ii .",
    "all knot diagrams can be represented by gauss codes , but in fact not all gauss code sequences represent knot diagrams ; for instance , the sequence @xmath58 appears to be a consistent gauss code of only two crossings , which can not be simplified by reidemeister moves , and no knot has @xmath11 . on attempting to draw a diagram with this code , one finds it would be necessary for there to be one extra crossing to allow the curve to return to its starting point .",
    "in fact , this is the gauss code of the open diagram shown in fig .",
    "2 ( e ) of the main text , and gauss codes for open diagrams , and their relation to virtual knots , is the subject of the next section",
    ".    it can be practically difficult to calculate the knot type of a diagram coming from a projection of a complicated 3d space curve , which may have many more crossings than its minimal number @xmath0 .",
    "these crossings would represent local geometrical or biochemical features that do not affect the overall knot type ; the knot diagrams found from closures of protein backbones often contain several hundred crossings .",
    "our knot identification proceeds first by algorithmic simplification via removal of crossings , repeatedly applying reidemeister moves i and ii where they would remove crossings locally ( supplementary fig .",
    "[ fig : supp_fig_1](a ) ) , as discussed above .",
    "there is no known efficient method to produce minimal knot diagrams in this way as reidemeister move iii may also be essential to simplify the diagram but does not directly reduce the crossing number . in the case of protein backbones ,",
    "this occasionally produces minimal diagrams but in most cases tens to hundreds of crossings remain .",
    "the knot types of the simplified diagrams are calculated using _ knot invariants _ , quantities that depend only on the knot type but are calculated from the geometrical information of the curve , i.e.  they can be calculated from only the information in a gauss code and their value is invariant to reidemeister moves .",
    "much of mathematical knot theory is devoted to the study of knot invariants , and many types are known .",
    "for instance , the minimal crossing number discussed above is a knot invariant  @xcite , but there is no simple algorithm to calculate it directly from a presentation of a knot .",
    "the minimal crossing number also demonstrates that most invariants do not perfectly distinguish knots  @xcite , as multiple different knots can clearly have the same number of crossings in their minimal projections ; for instance , both @xmath5 and @xmath6 in fig .",
    "2(a ) have @xmath59 .",
    "more discriminatory invariants exist but are generally relatively difficult to calculate .    for knot identification we use knot invariants that can be calculated efficiently ( ideally in low order polynomial time in the number of crossings ) , while still discriminating knots sufficiently well .",
    "in particular , we choose invariants which leave no ambiguity between the knots common on closure of proteins such as those in fig .",
    "2(a ) of the main text .",
    "some protein closures produce complex knots whose knot type can not be uniquely identified using these efficient invariants , but these occur only rarely and do not impact our analysis . for classical knots , we employ only the _ alexander polynomial _ @xmath13 , which can be found as the determinant of a matrix whose rows and columns relate to the crossings of a projected diagram and can be easily constructed from a gauss code  @xcite .",
    "computing symbolic matrices numerically is relatively slow , and we instead use the values of @xmath35 evaluated at roots of unity @xmath36 , @xmath60 and @xmath38 , such that the calculation can be performed using floating point arithmetic ( this does not introduce appreciable error ) . each of these is individually a lesser knot invariant , but together they have discriminatory power comparable to the full alexander polynomial up to at least 11 minimal crossings ( certainly sufficient for the relatively simple knots that appear in protein chains ) .",
    "many knot invariants , including the alexander polynomial , are available from standard online resources including the knot atlas  @xcite for all knots with up to 15 crossings , and knotinfo  @xcite for a wider selection of invariants up to 12 crossings .",
    "supplementary table  [ table : supp_tab_1 ] shows values of @xmath13 at the roots of unity used above , for each of the simple knots that appear most commonly in protein chains .",
    "_ virtual knots _ are an extension to the theory of classical knots  @xcite which classify all topological objects formed of ordered crossings , which generalises the theory of knot diagrams while keeping a sense of isotopy through reidemeister moves .",
    "in particular , this includes those orderings which can not be realised as plane projections of ( closed ) space curves in @xmath48 . they can be thought of as the objects represented by the set of _ all _ gauss codes , including sequences such as @xmath58 , which does not correspond to any closed knot diagram , as discussed above . in this sense , they provide a natural framework to describe _ open _ diagrams , with endpoints that can not directly be joined , so do not correspond to classical knots but have knot - like structure in their sequence of ordered crossings .    many concepts from classical knot theory naturally generalise to virtual knots , such as the distinction between prime and composite virtual knots ( including composites with classical and virtual components ) .",
    "virtual knots are tabulated according to their minimum classical crossing number @xmath0  @xcite , and they are denoted here as @xmath9 , following the tabulation of  @xcite , as described in the main text .",
    "the simplest nontrivial virtual knot , @xmath24 , has @xmath11 , and gauss code @xmath61 .",
    "there are many more prime virtual knots for @xmath62 than classical knots ; complete tabulations only extend to virtual knots up to @xmath59 .",
    "there are also up to three distinct chiral symmetric partners of a given virtual knot ( compared to at most one partner of opposite chirality for classical knots ) : a mirror reflection of the diagram preserving the classical crossing signs , an inversion where all classical crossing signs are flipped , and the combination of both mirrors . as with the classical knots , we identify all chiral partners of the same virtual knot type as equivalent .",
    "@xcite presents two further equivalent interpretations of virtual knots , both of which illustrate properties discussed in the main text .",
    "the first , convenient for diagrammatic representation , draws virtual knots as classical knot diagrams ( without endpoints ) but augmented with an additional crossing type at self intersection , the _",
    "virtual crossing _",
    ", denoted by a circle around the intersection ( e.g. fig .",
    "2(b ) of the main text ) .",
    "virtual crossings do not have a sign and do not contribute to topological calculations , so the gauss code follows only by considering the virtual diagram s classical crossings and ignoring virtual crossings entirely . in such virtual diagrams ,",
    "virtual crossings can be manipulated by suitable generalisations of the classical reidemeister moves , which can affect the configuration of virtual and classical crossings but do not change the virtual knot type ; these moves are shown in supplementary fig .",
    ". in particular , virtual reidemeister moves i and ii can change the number of virtual crossings , and minimal virtual crossing number is an invariant of virtual knots ; those with minimum virtual crossing number zero are the classical knots , which make up a subset of the generalised , virtual knots .",
    "we describe a knot here as virtual if the minimum number of virtual crossings is greater than zero .",
    "the other interpretation of virtual knots is as closed knot diagrams drawn on surfaces with topology different to the standard plane of projection ( equivalent to its one - point compactification , the 2-sphere ) , i.e.  drawn on handlebodies with nonzero genus .",
    "any virtual knot can be drawn as a knot diagram without virtual crossings on a surface of sufficiently high genus  @xcite .",
    "the virtual crossings previously described are then interpreted as a consequence of projection from the handlebody to a plane , in which case the virtual crossings are intersections of two strands from different bridges of the handlebody ( likewise , a virtual knot diagram with virtual crossings can be made a knot diagram on a handlebody by replacing each virtual crossing with a handle which one strand passes ` along ' and the other ` under ' the handle ) .",
    "the minimum genus of any handlebody on which the virtual knot can be drawn defines the _ virtual genus _",
    "( hereafter referred to as the genus , although this is distinctly different to the genus referred to in classical knot theory  @xcite ) of the virtual knot , and is therefore 0 for classical knots while any virtual knot must have genus at least 1 .    here",
    ", we are considering 2d open diagrams as virtual knots , and these interpretations of virtual knots relate directly to virtual closure of open diagrams ( formed by projection of open 3d chains ) considered in the main text .",
    "the virtual closure of an open knot diagram corresponds to adding a closing arc between the open diagram s endpoints , where all intersections of this arc with the rest of the diagram make virtual crossings .",
    "all closure arcs are equivalent as they may be transformed to one another using virtual reidemeister moves ; the gauss code only depends on the original open diagram , and does not change when the virtual crossings are altered .",
    "in fact , the virtual reidemeister moves can be interpreted in terms of the endpoints of open diagrams , shown in supplementary fig .",
    "1(c ) in which the moves are effectively equivalent to different choices of closure .",
    "it is possible to consider the open diagram in these terms alone ( i.e.  the open diagram is subject only to the three classical reidemeister moves , but the endpoints are forbidden to pass over or under a strand creating ( or removing ) new crossings , supplementary fig .",
    "1(d ) , otherwise the open diagram could be untangled to the trivial open curve ) ; this would produce a _ classical knotoid _",
    "@xcite , a topological object that encodes information about the topology of the open curve , but whose classes are not isomorphic to the virtual knots  @xcite . representing knotoids by virtual knots loses some information  for instance it may not be clear , from a virtual diagram , which arc at a virtual crossing is the virtual closure arc ( i.e.  multiple , distinct knotoids give the same virtual knot ) .",
    "however , in our analysis , we opt to work with virtual knots since their tabulation , invariants and other properties are a lot better developed and understood than for knotoids , and therefore are more convenient for application without new mathematics . only a small amount of information is apparently lost through the ambiguity of knotoids as virtual knots , which does not appear to unduly limit topological analysis ; this can be considered as a similar simplification to ignoring the chirality of knots .",
    "since all the virtual crossings resulting from virtual closure necessarily occur sequentially along the same arc , the genus of virtual knots obtained by closing open diagrams is at most one . that is , all the virtual crossings of the diagram may be removed by adding a single handle to the surface on which it is drawn , in between the endpoints of the open curve , and along which the closing arc runs .",
    "not all genus one virtual knots can be represented in this way such that their virtual crossings occur sequentially ; an example is shown in supplementary fig .",
    "2(a ) , whose two virtual crossings can never be adjacent even under the application of ( virtual ) reidemeister moves , although the knot can be drawn on a genus one surface sich as the planar diagram shown in supplementary fig .",
    "the class of virtual knots that can be obtained from closures of open knot diagrams is therefore subset of genus one virtual knots , whose minimal presentations pass around the torus exactly once in one generator direction , and at least once in the other .",
    "this is related to the homology of the curve as drawn on a genus one handlebody : for any such diagram we can associate an index with the number of times a curve wraps around the torus in each direction , and for a virtual knot these homology indices must be of the form @xmath63 for @xmath64 ( although this condition is not on its own sufficient due to the presence of more complex topologies with the same overall homology ) .",
    "we therefore refer to the virtual knots appearing as virtual closures of open curves as _ minimally genus one virtual knots_.    the virtual knots of genus one were studied and tabulated by  @xcite .",
    "their description involves a virtual knot invariant that is a generalisation of the kauffman bracket polynomial with two variables @xmath65 and @xmath66 , calculated from the virtual knot diagram as drawn on the 2-torus .",
    "each possible bracket smoothing of this diagram , @xmath67 , is associated with a factor of @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the number of circles of nontrivial homology in a given smoothing .",
    "the polynomials for all minimally genus 1 virtual knots therefore have the form @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is a function of the knot which does not depend on @xmath66 , and this property therefore allows all minimally genus one knots to be readily identified .",
    "the minimally genus one virtual knots of up to @xmath12 , in the genus one table  @xcite are , in the notation of that work : @xmath72 , @xmath3 , @xmath25 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 . in the complete virtual knot table",
    "@xcite , the diagrams which are explicitly minimally genus one are : @xmath24 , @xmath28 , @xmath79 , @xmath30 , @xmath80 , @xmath42 and @xmath81 . after comparing knot invariants between the two tabulations , we were unable to find a partner in  @xcite for the minimally genus one @xmath79 ( i.e.  it appears to be an erroneous omission )",
    ". thus , from  @xcite we could identify three further minimally genus one virtual knots than the complete table , with this property also confirmed via the kauffman bracket method ; these correspond to @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 in  @xcite ( up to chiral mirrors ) .",
    "this relationship would be difficult to see by direct inspection of the diagram , and supplementary fig .",
    "[ fig : supp_fig_3 ] demonstrates the equivalence of the different presentations for @xmath84 , via a combination of virtual reidemeister moves and planar isotopies .",
    "all other minimally genus one examples agree in the two tables , and we believe that this completes the full set of minimally genus one virtual knots with up to four classical crossings .    just as with classical knots , we identify virtual knot types by calculating virtual knot invariants ( which are , in many cases , generalisations of classical invariants , such as the kauffman bracket polynomial already discussed ) . typically it is more computationally expensive to discriminate virtual knots than classical knots of the same minimum crossing number @xmath0 .",
    "the basic procedure of invariant calculation is similar to that of classical knots , although now virtual crossings may also be algorithmically removed via virtual reidemeister moves i and ii . this does not directly affect the classical crossings , but may allow more of them to be removed .",
    "the alexander polynomial has a number of extensions in virtual knot theory ; we work with the two variable _ generalised alexander polynomial _",
    "@xmath85  @xcite . as with classical knots ,",
    "the calculation is significantly faster evaluated at constant values of @xmath67 and @xmath86 , and we use the combinations ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) , ( @xmath39 , @xmath38 ) and ( @xmath41 , @xmath38 ) .",
    "however , in contrast to classical knots , the generalised alexander polynomial is not enough to distinguish the two simplest virtual knots possible from open curves , @xmath24 and @xmath28 , as well as some other simple virtual knots ( the next are @xmath82 and @xmath80 , but although they are relatively simple these do not contribute significantly to any of our analysis ) .",
    "when necessary ( but primarily in the case of @xmath24 and @xmath28 ) , we resolve this ambiguity using the _ jones polynomial _",
    "@xmath21  @xcite , which is a classical knot invariant that extends to virtual knots without modification .",
    "since computation of the jones polynomial takes exponential time in the number of crossings  @xcite , we compute it only at the constant @xmath44 ( sufficient to distinguish @xmath24 , @xmath28 , etc . ) , and only when our chosen values of @xmath85 are not sufficiently discriminatory to identify the virtual knot .    virtual knot invariants for each of the virtual knots with up to four classical crossings can be found in the online knot table of  @xcite or , for the kauffman bracket variant explained above , in  @xcite .",
    "supplementary table  [ table : supp_tab_1 ] further shows the values of @xmath46 and @xmath87 for each of the minimally genus one virtual knots in these tables , which together are clearly sufficient to distinguish all relevant knot types ."
