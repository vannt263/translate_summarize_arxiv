    "the most prominent difference appears in the antiferromagnetic ( af ) region near the mott insulator , where the af order disappears with a small amount of carrier concentration ( @xmath9% ) in a hole - doped cuprate la@xmath10sr@xmath11cuo@xmath12 ( lsco ) , while in an electron - doped cuprate nd@xmath10ce@xmath11cuo@xmath12 ( ncco ) the af order persists up to @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite a difference in magnetic properties is also seen in inelastic neutron scattering experiments : lsco shows incommensurate spin structures for a wide range of @xmath14 ,  @xcite while in ncco there is no incommensurate structures but commensurate ones are observed .",
    "@xcite it is also an important difference that a spin - gap behavior observed in the underdoped region of hole - doped cuprates by the nuclear magnetic resonance experiments is not reported in electron - doped cuprates .",
    "@xcite    differences in the electronic properties between the hole- and electron - doped cuprates are also observed in other experiments .",
    "the optical conductivity obtained from reflectivity measurements exhibits a pseudogap feature at around 0.2  ev in the af phase of ncco ,  @xcite but there is no such a feature in lsco with the same carrier concentration .",
    "the occurrence of the pseudogap in the optical conductivity is correlated with the strong temperature dependence of the hall coefficients and a metallic behavior in the @xmath15-axis resistivity . from angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes )",
    "experiments , it is clearly observed that hole carriers doped into the parent mott insulators first enter into the @xmath16 points in the brillouin zone and produce a fermi arc ,  @xcite but electron carriers are accommodated at around @xmath17 and @xmath18 and then the fermi surface is formed in the superconducting region .",
    "@xcite the doping dependence of core - level photoemission also shows different behaviors of the chemical potential shift between ncco and lsco .",
    "@xcite these experimental data indicate the difference of the electronic states between hole- and electron - doped cuprates .",
    "the electronic states and magnetic properties in the electron - doped cuprates have been theoretically examined by many groups , focusing on the comparison with the hole - doped ones .",
    "@xcite among them , the present author has studied a @xmath0-@xmath1 model with the second - neighbor hopping @xmath2 and third one @xmath3 ( a @xmath0-@xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath1 model ) .",
    "@xcite by applying the numerically exact diagonalization technique based on the lanczos algorithm to small clusters , the dynamical spin structure factor , optical conductivity , single - particle spectral function , and thermodynamic properties have been calculated , and it has been pointed out that the difference of af correlations caused by the presence of @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a prime source of the contrasting behaviors in the electronic states between the hole- and electron - doped cuprates .    in small clusters used in our previous works ,  @xcite the momenta defined were discrete in the momentum space , since periodic boundary conditions ( bc ) were used .",
    "thus , momentum - dependent quantities such as the single - particle spectral function suffer from the discreteness .",
    "two - particle correlation functions also suffer from the finite - size effects under the periodic bc , because the two - particle operators are described as the convolution of the single - particle operators that are defined discretely in the momentum space .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to introduce a method that overcomes such discreteness and to clarify whether such a method changes the conclusions derived from small cluster calculations under the periodic bc . in this paper , we introduce twisted bc for a 20-site square @xmath0-@xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath1 cluster .",
    "the introduction of the twist can make the momenta defined continuous in the brillouin zone , and thus we overcome the difficulty of the discreteness in the spectral function .",
    "@xcite for two - particle correlation functions , we introduce an averaging procedure over the twisted bc .",
    "this procedure is known to reduce finite - size effects .",
    "@xcite therefore , results obtained under the twisted bc are expected to provide new information that has not been obtained under the periodic bc .",
    "the quantities examined in this paper are , in addition to the single - particle spectral function , several response functions in terms of spin and charge , i.e. , the dynamical spin correlation , two - magnon raman scattering , and the optical conductivity , together with several static correlations .",
    "being consistent with the previous works under periodic bc ,  @xcite we find that af spin correlation remains strong in electron doping , in contrast to the case of hole doping , in the presence of the second- and third - neighbor hoppings @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this leads to a remarkable electron - hole asymmetry in the dynamical spin structure factor and two - magnon raman scattering .",
    "the single - particle spectral function also show dramatic differences between hole and electron dopings .",
    "along the nodal direction , i.e. , the @xmath19-@xmath20 direction , a quasiparticle band in the hole - doped system is gapless at the fermi level as expected , while in electron doping the band is gapped up to the concentration @xmath7 .",
    "the gap is found to be correlated with the strength of af correlation , indicating that the gap is magnetically driven .",
    "the spectral function around the antinodal region , i.e. , @xmath4 region , shows contrasting behaviors : a gap appears in hole doping but not in electron doping , leading to a fermi - arc behavior only in the hole - doped system .",
    "the gap is found to be sensitive to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as is the case of the nodal gap in electron doping .",
    "such a fermi arc behavior has not been detected under the periodic bc . in the optical conductivity",
    ", a pseudogap clearly appears in the electron - doped system after the averaging procedure over the twisted bc .",
    "the origin of the pseudogap is attributed to the strong af correlation in the spin background .",
    "the gap is found to have the same magnitude as that in the spectral function along the nodal direction , indicating the same origin . in terms of pairing of carriers ,",
    "we examine the @xmath8-wave pairing correlation function .",
    "the pairing is found to be enhanced in the underdoped region of electron - doped system and also in the overdoped region of hole - doped one , being consistent with previous studies under the periodic and open bc .",
    "@xcite since the quantities examined have fewer finite - size effects as compared with those under the periodic bc , we can make a more precise comparison between these results and experimental data . from the comparison , we discuss similarities and differences between them as well as their implications .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "<S> we systematically examine the asymmetry of the electronic states in the hole- and electron - doped cuprates by using a @xmath0-@xmath1 model with the second - neighbor hopping @xmath2 and third one @xmath3 ( the @xmath0-@xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath1 model ) . </S>",
    "<S> numerically exact diagonalization method is employed for a 20-site square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we impose twisted boundary conditions ( bc ) instead of standard periodic bc . for static and dynamical correlation functions , averaging procedure over the twisted bc </S>",
    "<S> is used to reduce the finite - size effect . </S>",
    "<S> we find that antiferromagnetic spin correlation remains strong in electron doping in contrast to the case of hole doping , being similar to the case of the periodic bc . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a remarkable electron - hole asymmetry in the dynamical spin structure factor and two - magnon raman scattering . by changing the twist , </S>",
    "<S> the single - particle spectral function is obtained for all momenta in the brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> examining the spectral function in detail , we find a gap opening at around the @xmath4 region for 10% doping of holes ( the carrier concentration @xmath5 ) , leading to a fermi arc that is consistent with experiments . in electron doping </S>",
    "<S> , however , a gap opens at around @xmath6 and persists up to @xmath7 , being correlated with the strength of the antiferromagnetic correlation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the magnitude of the gaps is sensitive to @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> a pseudogap is also seen in the optical conductivity for electron doping , and its magnitude is found to be the same as that in the spectral function . we compare calculated quantities with corresponding experimental data , and discuss similarities and differences between them as well as their implications . </S>"
