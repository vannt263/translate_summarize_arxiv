    "a reliable method for estimating the black - hole masses of high - redshift quasars would provide crucial new information for understanding the nature and cosmological evolution of quasars . in this paper",
    "we address this problem by deriving a virial black - hole mass estimator based on rest - frame uv observables which is capable of producing reliable quasar black - hole mass estimates from optical spectra out to redshifts of @xmath5 .",
    "currently , the most direct measurements of the central black - hole masses of powerful active galactic nuclei ( agn ) come from the reverberation mapping studies of 17 seyferts and 17 pg quasars by wandel , peterson & malkan ( 1999 ) and kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) respectively . by measuring the time - lag between the variations of the agn continuum and the broad h@xmath1(4861",
    " ) emission line , these long - term monitoring programmes have delivered direct measurements of the radius of the h@xmath1emission region from the central ionizing source ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the time lag between the continuum and h@xmath1variations ) . by combining these measurements with the assumption that the fwhm of the h@xmath1line reflects the virialized bulk motion of the line - emitting material , it is then possible to produce the so - called virial estimate of the central black hole mass ( see wandel , peterson & malkan 1999 for a full discussion ) .",
    "although the virial mass estimate is potentially subject to many uncertainties ( eg .",
    "krolik 2001 ) , comparison with the predictions of the completely independent relation between black - hole mass and host - galaxy stellar velocity dispersion have shown the two to be in excellent agreement ( ferrarese et al .",
    "2001 , gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) .    unfortunately , because of the many years of monitoring required , it is unrealistic to expect that reverberation mapping measurements can be obtained for large samples of quasars , even at low redshift .",
    "however , the existing reverberation mapping of low redshift agn has revealed a correlation between @xmath8 and the monochromatic agn continuum luminosity at 5100 ( eg .",
    "@xmath9 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) . by exploiting this correlation to estimate @xmath8",
    "it is possible to produce a virial black - hole mass estimate from a single spectrum covering the h@xmath1emission line .",
    "this technique has recently been widely employed to investigate how the masses of quasar black holes relate to the properties of the surrounding host galaxies ( eg .",
    "mclure & dunlop 2002;2001 ; laor 2001 ) and the radio luminosity of the central engine ( dunlop et al .",
    "2002 ; lacy et al .",
    "however , because of the atmospheric restrictions and relative observational expense of near - infrared spectroscopy , the vast majority of previous studies have relied on optical spectroscopy of the h@xmath1region .",
    "unfortunately , this effectively enforces a redshift upper limit of @xmath10 , with the vast majority of studies concentrating on samples at @xmath11 .",
    "an ideal solution to this problem would be to calibrate a rest - frame uv emission line and continuum measurement such that it becomes possible to produce a virial black - hole mass estimate for high - redshift quasars from relatively straightforward optical spectroscopy .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to provide the required uv calibration .",
    "there are two strong , permitted , broad uv lines which are candidates to replace h@xmath1 in the virial black - hole mass estimate ; civ(1549 ) and mg ii(2798 ) .",
    "we note here that vestergaard ( 2002 ) recently derived a uv virial black - hole mass estimator using the civ fwhm and the continuum luminosity at 1350 .",
    "although civ does have the advantage of being accessible with optical spectroscopy at the very highest redshifts ( @xmath12 ) , where mgii is redshifted into the near - infrared , there are a number of reasons to believe that mgii represents a better substitute for h@xmath1 over the redshift range @xmath13 .",
    "the main reason for adopting mgiias the uv tracer of blr velocity is that , like h@xmath1 , mgii is a low - ionization line .",
    "furthermore , due to the similarity of their ionization potentials , it is reasonable to expect that the mgii and h@xmath1 emission lines are produced by gas at virtually the same radius from the central ionizing source , an assumption which is supported by the good agreement between the mgii and h@xmath1 fwhm ( see section 5 ) .",
    "this has two important consequences .",
    "firstly , it allows us to directly adopt the reverberation mapping determinations of @xmath8 when calibrating the correlation between @xmath8 and 3000 continuum luminosity .",
    "secondly , because the line - widths of mgiiand h@xmath1should trace the same blr velocities , we are able to simply substitute the fwhm of mgiifor that of h@xmath1 in the virial mass estimator .",
    "there is one further practical advantage which favours mgiiover civ as the uv substitute for h@xmath1 . due to the fact that mgiibecomes accessible to optical spectroscopy at @xmath14 , both h@xmath1and mgiican be observed in a single optical spectrum within the redshift interval @xmath15 .",
    "consequently , it is therefore possible to directly compare the results of the new uv virial mass estimator against those of the established optical virial mass estimator for objects at intermediate redshifts .",
    "this test is performed in section [ lbqs ] using data for the large bright quasar survey ( forster et al .",
    "2001 ) and the radio - selected molonglo quasar sample ( baker et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the structure of this paper can be summarized as follows . in section [ virial ]",
    "we briefly review the main aspects of the virial black - hole mass estimate , before proceeding in section [ samples ] to describe the properties of the sample of low - redshift agn with reverberation mapping results . in sections [ radius ] and",
    "[ proxy ] this sample is used to calibrate the relation between broad - line radius and 3000 continuum luminosity ( @xmath16 ) and to demonstrate the viability of adopting mgiias a direct substitute for h@xmath1 in the virial black - hole mass estimator .",
    "our final calibration of the uv black - hole mass estimator is presented in section [ uv ] . in section [ lbqs ] the effectiveness of the new uv black - hole mass estimator",
    "is demonstrated by application to members of the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ) and the molonglo quasar sample ( mqs ) for which both h@xmath1and",
    "mgiifwhm measurements are available .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section [ conc ] .",
    "all cosmological calculations presented in this paper assume @xmath17 kms@xmath18mpc@xmath18 .",
    "the underlying assumption behind the method of estimating agn black - hole masses from the width of their broad emission lines is that the motion of the line - emitting material is virialized . under this assumption",
    "the width of the broad lines can be used to trace the keplerian velocity of the broad - line gas , and thereby allow an estimate of the central black - hole mass via the formula : @xmath19 where @xmath8 is the blr radius and @xmath20 is the keplerian velocity of the blr gas .",
    "recent evidence to support the keplerian interpretation of agn broad - line widths has been presented by peterson & wandel ( 2000 ) and onken & peterson ( 2002 ) .",
    "these authors demonstrate , at least for several seyfert galaxies which have been well studied for reverberation mapping purposes , that the fwhm of various emission lines follow the @xmath21 relation expected for keplerian motion .",
    "it is important to note that it is not clear that the virial condition is satisfied for the high - ionization civ emission line .",
    "substantial evidence exists in the literature that civ may be produced in some form of outflow , as is suggested by the systematic blue - shift of civ compared to h@xmath1 ( eg . marziani et al .",
    "1996 ) .      in eqn [ mass ] the velocity of the blr gas is taken as @xmath22  @xmath23  @xmath24(fwhm ) , where @xmath25 is a geometric factor which relates the h@xmath1fwhm to the intrinsic keplerian velocity . due to the fact that there is currently no consensus on the geometry of the blr in radio - quiet quasars",
    "it is conventional to set @xmath26 .",
    "however , it is clear that if agn broad lines are in general produced in a more disc - like configuration , evidence for which has been found in radio - loud quasars by numerous authors ( eg .",
    "wills & browne 1986 ; brotherton 1996 ; vestergaard , wilkes &  barthel 2000 ) , then @xmath25 will be inclination dependent .",
    "indeed , in mclure & dunlop ( 2002 ) evidence was presented that the h@xmath1fwhm is inclination dependent in radio - quiet quasars , and more consistent with the orbits of the h@xmath1emitting material having a flattened disc - like geometry than being randomly orientated . however , even in the scenario where the fwhm of h@xmath1and mgiiare entirely orientation dependent , inclination will only have a significant effect on the virial black - hole mass estimate for those objects within @xmath27 of the line of sight .",
    "if quasars are taken to be distributed randomly within @xmath28 of the line of sight ( barthel 1989 ) then this will only effect some 10% of objects .",
    "consequently , for the purposes of providing a generally applicable uv black - hole mass estimator we adopt @xmath29 throughout this paper .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "after successfully calibrating the @xmath16 relation , the second required element of the uv black - hole mass estimator is to calibrate the mgiifwhm as a substitute for h@xmath1 . as discussed in section",
    "[ intro ] , the principle reason for adopting mgiias the uv h@xmath1proxy is that it is a strong , fully - permitted , low - ionization line , and as such should provide the best uv analog of h@xmath1 .",
    "moreover , because the ionization potentials of h@xmath1and mgiiare very similar , the two lines should both be emitted at approximately the same radius from the central ionizing source .",
    "fortunately , this assumption can be tested directly using the 22 objects from the rm sample for which we have mgiifwhm measurements .",
    "if mgiiand h@xmath1are being produced at the same broad - line radius then , if the blr is virialized , we should see a 1:1 relation between mgiifwhm and h@xmath1fwhm .",
    "fig [ mg2-hb_rm ] shows mgii fwhm versus h@xmath1 fwhm for the 22 objects from the rm sample with mgiifwhm measurements .",
    "the solid line in fig [ mg2-hb_rm ] shows an exact 1:1 relation between mgiiand h@xmath1fwhm .",
    "it can be seen that , with the exception of ngc 4051 , the objects in the rm sample are perfectly consistent with mgiiand h@xmath1tracing the same blr velocity .",
    "the clear outlier , ngc 4051 , is a well studied example of a narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) .",
    "the h@xmath1fwhm for this object has been determined by numerous authors and is consistently found to be around 1000 kms@xmath18 ( eg .",
    "wandel , peterson & malkan ( 1999 ) find h@xmath1fwhm=1170 kms@xmath18 ) .",
    "however , from our line - fitting of iue archive spectra we find a strong broad component to the mgiiemission line with fwhm=2790@xmath30kms@xmath18 .    in fact , several previous studies have found that the uv emission lines of nls1 possess strong broad components which are not seen in their balmer lines ( eg .",
    "rodrguez - pascual , mas - hesse & santos - lle 1997 , zheng et al .",
    "this suggests that mgiimay actually provide a better estimate of the blr velocity of low - ionization gas in nls1 , where the balmer lines could be biased , at least in part , by inclination effects .",
    "irrespective of the reason why ngc 4051 is an outlier in fig [ mg2-hb_rm ] , we can safely exclude it from a regression fit to the mgii- h@xmath1fwhm relation .",
    "the reason for this is that we are principally interested in providing a uv black - hole mass estimator for high redshift quasars , the vast majority of which have h@xmath1fwhm @xmath31 kms@xmath18 .",
    "the dotted line in fig [ mg2-hb_rm ] shows the bces bisector fit which is equivalent to a relation of the form : @xmath32 which is clearly consistent with a linear relation . in the light of this result",
    ", an exact 1:1 relation between the mgiifwhm and h@xmath1fwhm is assumed in the next section for the final calibration of the uv black - hole mass estimator .",
    "having determined in the previous two sections the @xmath33 relation and the 1:1 scaling between h@xmath1fwhm and mgiifwhm , we are now in a position to derive our uv black - hole mass estimator . in fig [ test ]",
    "we show the reverberation mapping black - hole mass estimate versus the new uv mass estimate , which uses the @xmath16 relation to estimate @xmath8 and the mgii fwhm to trace the blr velocity .",
    "it is clear from fig [ test ] that mrk 335 is an outlier . as with ngc 4051 ,",
    "mrk 335 is another example of a nls1 .",
    "the reason mrk 335 is an outlier in fig [ test ] is that the fwhm of the variable component of its h@xmath1line determined from reverberation mapping is only 1260 kms@xmath18 ( wandel , peterson & malkan 1999 ) , while from our line - fitting of iue archive spectra we detect a strong broad component in the mgiiline with fwhm=8605 kms@xmath18 .",
    "our line - fitting results for this object are in excellent agreement with those of zheng et al .",
    "( 1995 ) who detected a broad mgiicomponent of fwhm=8218 kms@xmath18 . again , as mentioned in the previous section , it appears a possibility that for at least some nls1 s the width of the h@xmath1emission line may not be a reliable tracer of blr velocities .",
    "of course , it is also possible that mrk 335 may simply be a genuine outlier .",
    "the solid line in fig [ test ] is the bisector fit to the data , excluding mrk 335 , and has the form : @xmath34 @xmath35 again , consistent with a linear relation .",
    "consequently , our final calibration of the uv mass estimator has the form : @xmath36 where the off - set of @xmath37 is adopted to ensure a mean @xmath38:@xmath39 ratio of unity . in terms of a useful formula",
    "the best fitting calibration of the uv black - hole mass estimator is therefore : @xmath40 for completeness we have also re - derived the optical ( h@xmath1 ) virial black - hole mass estimator using our re - analysis of the @xmath41 relation in section [ radius ] . as expected , the correlation between @xmath38 and @xmath42 is also consistent with being linear ( @xmath43 ) which , in the same fashion as for the uv estimate , leads to : @xmath44      having arrived at the final calibration of the uv black - hole mass estimator it is of obvious interest to assess the accuracy with which it can reproduce the full reverberation mass estimate .",
    "excluding mrk 335 , the mean difference between the reverberation and the uv estimator is : @xmath45 where the quoted uncertainty is the standard deviation ( @xmath46 ) and not the standard error .",
    "therefore , provided the rm sample is representative of broad - line agn in general , we conclude that the uv black - hole estimator provided by eqn@xmath30[final ] can reproduce the reverberation black - hole mass to within a factor of 2.5 @xmath47 .",
    "for the same sample the uncertainty on the optical estimator given in eqn [ optical ] is a factor of @xmath48 .",
    "having derived the desired black - hole mass estimator in the previous section , we next assess its performance when applied to the spectra of the lbqs and the radio - selected mqs . if the new uv black - hole mass estimator is to be used in the analysis of high - redshift quasars , it is clearly important to ensure that it does not produce results which are biased with respect to the usual optical ( h@xmath1 ) estimator .",
    "therefore , our intention in this section is to simply test how the new uv mass estimator ( eqn [ final ] ) compares to the usual optical mass estimator ( eqn [ optical ] ) when applied to those objects from the lbqs and mqs for which both the appropriate uv ( @xmath49 , mgiifwhm ) and optical ( @xmath50 , h@xmath1fwhm ) data are available .    due to the fact that the lbqs is optically selected , while the mqs is a complete radio - selected quasar sample , applying the uv black - hole mass estimator to both samples allows us to ensure that eqn [ final ] is equally applicable to both radio - quiet and radio - loud quasars .",
    "the lbqs consists of 1058 optically - selected quasars in the redshift range @xmath51  @xmath52  @xmath53 ( see hewett , foltz & chaffee ( 1995 ) for a full description ) .",
    "a comprehensive study of the optical continuum and emission line properties of 992 quasars from the lbqs has recently been published by forster et al . (",
    "2001 ) . in this section",
    "we use data from forster et al . for a 99-object sub - sample with reliable measurements of both mgiiand h@xmath1fwhm and continuum fluxes at 3000 and 5100  . this sub - sample",
    "comprises 68% of the 145 lbqs objects in the redshift range @xmath54 within which both mgiiand h@xmath1fall on the lbqs spectra .",
    "the molonglo quasar sample is a complete , radio - selected , sample consisting of 111 quasars in the redshift range @xmath55  @xmath56  @xmath57  @xmath58 with a 408 mhz flux density greater than 0.95 jy ( kapahi et al .",
    "optical spectra for 79 mqs quasars were published by baker et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , together with a preliminary analysis of their emission line properties .",
    "we are currently engaged in an automated study of the optical and uv emission lines from the mqs optical spectra ( kindly provided by j. baker ) , from which it has been possible to reliably measure the mgiiand h@xmath1fwhm for 29/38 objects where the mqs spectra include both emission lines . unlike the lbqs , baker ( 1997 ) has shown that many mqs objects display substantial reddening in their optical spectra . as a result , the continuum luminosities of the reddest mqs objects were de - reddened using the smc extinction curve of pei ( 1992 ) , assuming an intrinsic continuum slope of @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) which was found by baker ( 1997 ) to be typical of the least reddened mqs objects .      in fig [ mg2-hb ]",
    "we show the optical black - hole mass estimator plotted against the new uv black - hole mass estimator for a combined sample of 150 objects , comprising 99 from the lbqs , 29 from the mqs and the 22 objects of the rm sample .",
    "also shown is the bces bisector fit to the lbqs and mqs objects which has the form :    @xmath61    @xmath62    which , as expected , is perfectly consistent with a linear relation . in fig [ ratio ]",
    "we show a histogram of @xmath63 for the 128 objects from the lbqs and mqs .",
    "the solid line shows the best - fitting gaussian which has @xmath64 .",
    "these results , in combination with those of section [ uv ] , lead us to conclude that compared to the traditional optical black - hole mass estimator , the new uv estimator provides results which are unbiased and of equal accuracy .",
    "although a full analysis of the black - hole masses of the lbqs and mqs samples is beyond the scope of this paper , we will briefly comment here on one obvious feature of fig  4 .",
    "it is immediately apparent from fig [ mg2-hb ] that the mqs quasars are confined to the highest black - hole masses . in fact , 27/29 of the mqs quasars have black - hole masses @xmath65 , adopting either the uv or optical mass estimator .",
    "in contrast , only 17% of the 99 lbqs quasars have uv and optical black - hole mass estimates which are both @xmath66 .",
    "naively this would appear to suggest that there is a clear division in black - hole mass between the radio - selected mqs and the largely radio - quiet lbqs .",
    "however , because the wavelength coverage of the lbqs spectra only extends to @xmath67 , compared to @xmath68 for those of the mqs , the need to include both mgiiand h@xmath1on the spectra introduces a considerable redshift bias into the two sub - samples under investigation here . due to the differences in wavelength coverage",
    "the mean redshift of the lbqs sub - sample is @xmath69 , while that of the mqs is @xmath70 .",
    "consequently , the members of the mqs sub - sample are on average more optically luminous than those of the lbqs sub - sample , with an average luminosity of @xmath71 compared to @xmath72 . therefore , with reference to the @xmath73 relation",
    ", we would expect that , simply due to this luminosity bias , the average black - hole mass of the mqs sub - sample would be a factor of @xmath74 larger than that of the lbqs .",
    "however , in reality the average black - hole mass of the mqs sub - sample is @xmath75 whereas that of the lbqs sub - sample is more than a factor of 6 lower at @xmath76 ) mass estimator although , as expected from fig [ mg2-hb ] , the black - hole mass difference is comparable if the uv mass estimator is adopted ( @xmath77 dex ) ] .",
    "the origin of the additional factor of three difference in the average black - hole masses is a highly significant difference in the distributions of h@xmath1and mgiifwhm .",
    "for example , the average mgiifwhm of the mqs sub - sample is a factor of @xmath78 greater than the average mgiifwhm of the lbqs sub - sample .",
    "the equivalent factor for h@xmath1fwhm is @xmath79 .",
    "the application of a kolmogorov - smirnov test returns a probability of @xmath80 that the two h@xmath1fwhm distributions are drawn from the same parent distribution ( @xmath81 for the mgiifwhm distributions ) .",
    "it is important to note that the differences in the fwhm distributions of the two samples do not appear to be related to the previously mentioned redshift / luminosity bias .",
    "an application of the partial spearman rank correlation test ( macklin 1982 ) reveals no significant correlations between h@xmath1fwhm , redshift and @xmath50 or mgiifwhm , redshift and @xmath82 .",
    "in fact , these results are in good agreement with previous studies of the black - hole masses of radio - quiet and radio - loud quasars which were not subject to a redshift / luminosity bias . in their study of a sample of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars with a matched redshift - luminosity distribution at @xmath83 ,",
    "mclure & dunlop ( 2002 ) found the average black - hole mass of the radio - loud quasars to be a factor of @xmath84 larger than their radio - quiet counterparts , albeit with a large overlap .",
    "likewise , laor ( 2000 ) found a clean separation in black - hole mass within the pg quasar sample , with the radio - loud quasars being confined to @xmath85 . in contrast , from their study of the first bright quasar survey ( fbqs ) , lacy et al .",
    "( 2001 ) concluded that the apparent gap in the quasar black - hole mass  radio - power plane is in fact filled by previously undetected radio - intermediate quasars .    in either case , it is clear that genuinely powerful , low - frequency selected , radio - loud quasars harbour central black - hole masses drawn from the extreme end of the agn black - hole mass function . at present",
    "it is not clear whether the low frequency of radio - quiet quasars with @xmath86 is real or , alternatively , is due to an inclination selection effect whereby the line - widths of optically selected quasars are biased to low values by a preference for selecting objects close to the line of sight .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the black - hole masses of high redshift radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars , the correlation between black - hole mass and radio power and the evidence for the role of inclination effects will be presented in a series of forthcoming papers ( mclure et al .",
    "2002 , in prep ) .",
    "finally , we note that our finding that the fwhm of h@xmath1and mgiiin the powerful radio - selected mqs objects are exclusively restricted to @xmath87 kms@xmath18 is of interest in the context of recent work on the location of radio - loud and radio - quiet agn in so - called eigenvector  1 space ( marziani et al .",
    "2001 ) . in their study marziani et al .",
    "concluded that powerful radio - loud quasars appear to be restricted to h@xmath1fwhm @xmath88 kms@xmath18 , in excellent agreement with our analysis of the mqs spectra .",
    "a new technique for estimating the central black - hole masses of high - redshift quasars using the mgiifwhm and 3000 quasar continuum luminosity has been presented .",
    "the new technique has been calibrated using a sample of 34 low redshift agn with black - hole mass measurements based on long - term reverberation mapping experiments .",
    "the reliability of the new technique , with respect to the established optical virial black - hole mass estimator , has been tested using published data for the lbqs together with the results of a new analysis of the emission line properties of the mqs .",
    "the main conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows :    * the correlation between @xmath8 and monochromatic 3000 continuum luminosity is found to display less scatter than that between @xmath8 and 5100 monochromatic continuum luminosity . *",
    "the correlation between @xmath8 and 3000 continuum luminosity is found to be consistent with a relation of the form @xmath89 , as expected for a constant ionization parameter in all agn , irrespective of luminosity * the fwhm of mgiiis found to be an effective substitute for the fwhm of h@xmath1 .",
    "the relationship between the two fwhm is found to be perfectly consistent with an exact 1:1 scaling . * combining the @xmath90 relation with the fwhm of mgiiproduces a virial black - hole mass estimator based on rest - frame uv observables which is capable of reproducing black - hole masses determined from reverberation mapping to within a factor of 2.5 ( @xmath2 ) * an application to objects from the lbqs and mqs demonstrates that the new uv black - hole mass estimator produces results which are unbiased , and of equal accuracy to the established optical ( h@xmath1 ) black - hole mass estimator .",
    "* we therefore conclude that the new uv black - hole mass estimator is ideal for determining quasar black - hole masses in the redshift range @xmath91 via optical spectroscopy alone .",

    "<S> a new technique is presented for determining the black - hole masses of high - redshift quasars from optical spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the new method utilizes the full - width half maximum ( fwhm ) of the low - ionization mgii emission line and the correlation between broad - line region ( blr ) radius and continuum luminosity at 3000 . using archival uv spectra </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the correlation between blr radius and 3000 luminosity is tighter than the established correlation with 5100 luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is found that the correlation between blr radius and 3000 continuum luminosity is consistent with a relation of the form @xmath0 , as expected for a constant ionization parameter . using a sample of objects with broad - line radii determined from reverberation mapping it </S>",
    "<S> is shown that the fwhm of mg ii and h@xmath1 are consistent with following an exact one - to - one relation , as expected if both h@xmath1 and mgii are emitted at the same radius from the central ionizing source . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting virial black - hole mass estimator based on rest - frame uv observables is shown to reproduce black - hole mass measurements based on reverberation mapping to within a factor of 2.5 ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the new uv black - hole mass estimator is shown to produce identical results to the established optical ( h@xmath1 ) estimator when applied to 128 intermediate - redshift ( @xmath3 ) quasars drawn from the large bright quasar survey and the radio - selected molonglo quasar sample . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that the new uv virial black - hole mass estimator can be reliably used to estimate the black - hole masses of quasars from @xmath4 through to the peak epoch of quasar activity at @xmath5 via optical spectroscopy alone .    </S>",
