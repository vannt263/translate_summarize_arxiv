    "according to nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , the evolution of the state of an isolated quantum system is described by a deterministic unitary transformation , governed by the schrdinger equation .",
    "the behaviour of the state of a quantum system following the measurement of an observable is less well understood , however , and has been the subject of much debate . in quantum measurement theory it is usually assumed that when the measurement of an observable with a discrete spectrum is carried out on a system prepared in a prescribed initial state , then the state reduces randomly to one of the eigenstates of the observable being measured .",
    "this is the so - called projection postulate of von neumann @xcite , which was later generalised by lders @xcite to handle the case of a measurement of an observable with a degenerate spectrum .",
    "the lders postulate has the virtue of being unambiguously applicable whether or not the initial state is pure , and whether or not the eigenvalue spectrum is nondegenerate .",
    "stochastic extensions of the schrdinger equation have been increasingly attracting attention as plausible dynamical models for state vector reduction in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "in such models , the schrdinger equation is generalised to take the form of a special type of stochastic differential equation on hilbert space .",
    "for example , given a hamiltonian @xmath0 and a commuting observable @xmath1 with a discrete spectrum , there exists a natural stochastic differential equation generalising the schrdinger equation with the property that starting from a given initial pure state , the system evolves randomly in such a way that asymptotically it reaches one of the eigenstates of @xmath1 with the correct quantum probability .",
    "more generally , given a compatible family of observables @xmath2 @xmath3 , each of which commutes with @xmath0 , then a similar result holds , with an asymptotic reduction to one of the common eigenstates of the given family of observables . for recent reviews outlining the development of this approach , with extensive references ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyse in some detail the statistical laws associated with stochastic extensions of the schrdinger equation , and to show in particular how the projection postulate in the general form due to lders can be derived as a consequence of the dynamics .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sections 2 and 3 we review the von neumann and lders versions of the projection postulate . in section 4",
    "we present a reasonably self - contained account of the basic principles of stochastic state reduction , along with a brief synopsis of the relevant mathematical tools of stochastic analysis .",
    "for the purposes of illustration we consider primarily the case of an energy - based reduction model , for which the associated dynamics are given by the stochastic differential equation ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) , though most of the relevant mathematical and physical ideas can be readily generalised to the class of reduction processes noted above , based on a compatible family of observables that commute with the hamiltonian .    throughout the discussion we emphasise",
    "the role of martingale methods as an aid to the advancement of our understanding of quantum phenomena . in particular",
    "we show that the expectation of the hamiltonian , which fluctuates during the course of the reduction process , is a martingale , and its variance is a supermartingale .",
    "the martingale property satisfied by the expectation of the hamiltonian can be viewed as a kind of weak conservation law for the energy , generalising the ehrenfest relation . in section 5",
    "we use the doob - kolmogorov maximal inequalities to obtain a set of upper and lower bounds on the fluctuations of the energy during the reduction process , and show that the magnitude of a typical fluctuation is roughly of the order of the initial energy uncertainty .",
    "we also demonstrate that the process followed by the squared energy uncertainty is given by the conditional variance of the terminal value of the energy .    in sections 6 and 7",
    "we derive the projection postulate , and prove that the collapse to the general lders state occurs with the appropriate probability , whether or not the initial state is pure and whether or not the eigenvalue spectrum is degenerate .",
    "then in section 8 we study the implied evolution of the density matrix for a given initial state , not necessarily pure , and derive an exact time - dependent solution for the lindblad equation associated with the reduction .",
    "we conclude in section 9 by introducing a change - of - measure technique to solve the stochastic differential equation for the dynamics of the state vector , thereby constructing an explicit unravelling of the lindblad equation .",
    "let us consider a quantum system which , for mathematical simplicity , we shall assume is characterised by a finite dimensional hilbert space @xmath4 of dimension @xmath5 .",
    "suppose that @xmath6 is an observable for which the corresponding hermitian operator acting on @xmath4 is denoted @xmath1 .",
    "our interest here is in providing a clearer understanding of what happens if the observable @xmath6 is measured when the system is in a given pure state , corresponding to a ray through the origin in @xmath4 .",
    "first we shall examine the more straightforward case where @xmath6 has a nondegenerate spectrum , and the eigenvalues of @xmath1 are given by the numbers @xmath7 for @xmath8 , with the property that @xmath9 for @xmath10 .",
    "the eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath7 will be denoted @xmath11 , so that @xmath12 .      according to the _ projection postulate _ , when a measurement of @xmath6 is made , the state vector undergoes a transition @xmath15 to one of the eigenstates of @xmath1 .",
    "this occurs for a specified value of @xmath16 with the probability @xmath17 and the result of the measurement in that case is the eigenvalue @xmath7 . the associated transition latexmath:[$|\\psi_0\\rangle\\mapsto",
    "a more precise way of stating this is that when the observable @xmath6 is measured , the initial pure state @xmath13 transforms to a ` mixture ' , i.e. , a random state @xmath19 with the property that @xmath19 is given by the eigenstate @xmath11 with the probability @xmath20 .",
    "the fact that @xmath21 is a mixture reflects our ignorance of what the result of the measurement process will be . when the observable @xmath6 is measured , we can be confident that the result is one of the values @xmath7 , and that the new state is the eigenstate represented by @xmath11 , but we can not say in advance which one it will be . this is what is meant by saying that the result of the measurement is random .    the density matrix @xmath22 associated with the random state @xmath19 and the probability distribution @xmath20",
    "is given by the expectation of the random projection operator @xmath23 associated with @xmath19 .",
    "in other words , we have @xmath24 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum_{n=0}^{n } \\pi_n |f_n\\rangle\\langle f_n| . \\label{eq:2.2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath25 denotes expectation with respect to the distribution @xmath20 .",
    "the mixture @xmath19 typically carries more information than the density matrix @xmath22 alone , because if one is given @xmath22 , then in general there are many different mixtures that correspond to it @xcite .",
    "the significance of the density matrix @xmath22 is that if @xmath26 is any other observable , not necessarily compatible with @xmath6 , and we measure @xmath26 after we measure @xmath6 , then the expected value of @xmath26 is @xmath27 & = & \\sum_n \\pi_n \\langle f_n|{\\hat g}|f_n \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & = & { \\rm tr } \\sum_n \\pi_n |f_n\\rangle\\langle f_n|{\\hat g } \\\\",
    "\\label{eq:2.3 } & = & { \\rm tr}{\\hat\\rho}{\\hat g } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 denotes the trace operation .",
    "an alternative way of facilitating the description of the density matrix associated with the measurement outcome for an observable @xmath6 is to introduce the projection operator @xmath29 associated with the eigenvalue @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath6 is measured , the state @xmath13 is transformed to @xmath30 if the measurement outcome is known to be @xmath7 , for which the corresponding probability is @xmath20 .",
    "an analogous transformation holds for the corresponding density matrix @xmath31 here we use the notation @xmath32 to signify the density matrix before the measurement , and @xmath33 to signify the density matrix after the measurement .",
    "more generally , if @xmath6 is measured but the outcome is _ not _ known , then @xmath32 transforms according to the scheme latexmath:[\\ ] ] and @xmath32 is the density matrix corresponding to the random initial state .",
    "this result is consistent with our earlier expression ( [ eq:6.14 ] ) for the solution of the lindblad equation , and illustrates the fact that the change of measure technique is indeed highly effective as a calculational tool for quantum state reduction models .",
