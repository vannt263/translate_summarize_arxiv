    "the spectrum of the stochastic background of gw s generated by a cosmological network of cosmic strings ranges over many decades of frequency and has been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite . until recently , it has been tacitly assumed that the gw background generated by cosmic strings was nearly gaussian .",

    "@xcite , we mentioned that kink discontinuities on cosmic strings also give rise to non - gaussian gwb s .",
    "the simultaneous consideration of gwb s emitted by cusps and by kinks is important because , though cusps tend , generically , to form on _ smooth _ strings a few times per oscillation period @xcite , they might be absent on `` kinky '' strings ( i.e. continuous , but non differentiable strings ) . on the other hand",

    "as we shall see , these occasional sharp bursts might be detectable by the planned gw detectors ligo / virgo and lisa for string tensions as small as @xmath0 , i.e. in a wide range of seven orders of magnitude below the usually considered gut scale @xmath6 .",
    "in this section we discuss the amplitude of the gw emitted by an arbitrary stress - energy distribution @xmath7 as seen by an observer in the `` local wave zone '' of the source , i.e. at a distance @xmath8 from the source which is much larger than the gw wavelength of interest , but much smaller than the hubble radius . for this purpose",

    "we can compare three different gw amplitudes of relevance for the pulsar experiment : ( i ) the amplitude of individual bursts having a recurrence rate @xmath557 ( instead of the @xmath558 recurrence rate considered above for ligo or lisa ) , ( ii ) the rms amplitude of our confusion background ( [ eq6.16 ] ) , and ( iii ) the rms amplitude of the usually discussed full integral ( [ eq6.14 ] ) which includes both rare bursts and overlapping ones .",
    "we find    [ eq6.17 ] @xmath559    in computing the integrals ( [ eq6.14 ] ) and ( [ eq6.16 ] ) we have here used ( for better accuracy ) an improved estimate of the space density of loops , @xmath560 , eq .",
    "( [ eq5.1 ] ) . indeed ,",
    "numerical simulations indicate that , beyond the scaling @xmath561 one must add an extra factor related to the parameter characterizing the density of long strings .",
    "this factor is different in the radiation era and in the matter era . in the notation of @xcite",
    "this extra factor is @xmath562 in the radiation era , and is @xmath563 during the matter era . in other words , a better estimate of @xmath560",
    "is obtained by multiplying the estimate ( [ eq5.1 ] ) by the function [ eq6.18 ] c(z ) = 1 + 9 z / ( z+z_eq ) which interpolates between 1 in the matter era and 10 in the radiation era .",
    "note that , in terms of the contribution ( per frequency octave ) of gw s to the present energy density , @xmath564 , or , better , of their fractional contribution to the closure density , [ eq6.19 ] _ gw ( f ) = 6 g t_0 ^ 2 _ gw ~  ( f t_0)^2 h_rms^2 ( f ) , the results ( [ eq6.17 ] ) yield [ eq6.20 ] _ gw^confusion ( _ fid , f_c^psr ) = 2.99 10 ^ -7 , [ eq6.21 ] _ gw rms^usual ( _ fid , f_c^psr ) = 1.57 10 ^ -6 .",
    "the usually considered @xmath565 is 5.25 times larger than the physically meaningful confusion noise !",
    "this large discrepancy comes from the fact that @xmath566 includes the time - average contribution of rare , intense bursts , which are in general , not relevant for a pulsar experiment ( if they are so rare that they do not occur during the actual duration of the experiment ) .    from this consideration",
    ", it would seem to follow that the usual way to use pulsar data to set limits on @xmath456 ( i.e. the comparison between the theoretically predicted @xmath567 and the observational constraint on a gaussian @xmath568 ) is seriously affected by the present work .",
    "it would also seem that the correct way to set limits on @xmath569 from pulsar data consists simply in replacing @xmath570 by our new , significantly smaller , @xmath571 .",
    "then the value ( [ eq6.20 ] ) suggests that even cusp- ( rather than kink- ) dominated backgrounds , with @xmath459 ( as the one considered in the equations above ) generated by string tensions @xmath456 of order of @xmath572 might be compatible with pulsar constraints at the @xmath573 level .",
    "[ in view of the crudeness of our estimates we shall not try here to give any precise limit on @xmath456 from @xmath574 . ]    however , eqs .",
    "( [ eq6.17 ] ) show that the situation is actually somewhat more complex than that .",
    "indeed , eq .  ( [ eq6.17a ] ) shows that the ( observationally relevant ) @xmath575 bursts have an amplitude comparable to the full confusion noise ( which sums many overlapping , small signals ) .",
    "[ this comes from the fact that the confusion integral ( [ eq6.16 ] ) is dominated by its lower limit . ]",
    "therefore a significant part of the difference between @xmath576 and @xmath577 comes from not very intense , but not very rare bursts .",
    "[ note , however , that the dominant contribution in @xmath578 comes from the very intense , very rare bursts , with recurrence time @xmath579 . ] in other words , eqs .",
    "( [ eq6.17 ] ) show that , within the frequency bandwidth @xmath580 relevant for pulsar timing , the gw signal @xmath581 is a complicated superposition of a nearly gaussian noise ( of variance @xmath582 ) and of a small number of occasional random bursts , occurring on the @xmath583 time scale and of amplitude comparable to @xmath584 .",
    "in addition , there might also occur ( on longer time scales ) some larger bursts .",
    "this situation shows that one needs to reanalyze from scratch the pulsar limits on @xmath456 by dealing explicitly with the statistical properties of such a complicated mix of signals , i.e. by tackling seriously the strongly non gaussian nature ( involving an important quasi - poissonian component ) of @xmath581 within the pulsar timing bandwidth .",
    "until such an analysis , using our new results on the nature of the string gw background , is performed one can not draw secure limits on @xmath456 from pulsar observations .",
    "we expect , however , that the result of such an analysis will be , to a good approximation , equivalent to replacing @xmath585 by our new @xmath586 ( which is about five times smaller than @xmath585 when @xmath587 , and about four times smaller when @xmath588 ) . in particular , we expect that our results make a gut - like value @xmath4 now compatible ( even with many cuspy loops ) with present pulsar data .    leaving to future work such an analysis , we content ourselves by comparing in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the variation with @xmath354 of the cusp burst signal ( for @xmath459 and @xmath589 ) , the confusion gw amplitude @xmath590 ( @xmath557 ) , and the usually considered total rms amplitude @xmath591 .",
    "contrary to what happened in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we see now that the burst signal and the confusion signal are of comparable orders of magnitude in a wide range of values of @xmath592 .",
    "note also that @xmath578 is a significant overestimate of @xmath576 when @xmath593 , i.e. @xmath594 , which includes the gut case which has been traditionally of most interest for cosmic string research . in view of the subtlety we just mentionned concerning the data analysis of pulsar experiments we did not indicate in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] a precise `` one sigma '' level for the sensitivity of the pulsar experiment .",
    "[ a rough guess , using eq .",
    "( [ eq6.19 ] ) with @xmath595 is @xmath596 . ]",
    "switching from a defensive attitude ( pulsar limits on @xmath569 ) to an optimistic one ( detection of gw by pulsar experiments ) , and forgetting for a moment the subtlety of the fact that @xmath597 ( i.e. assuming that @xmath598 gives a good first estimate of the gw amplitude to be compared to the timing precision of pulsar experiments ) , it is striking to notice on fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that @xmath598 is a very flat function of @xmath354 , so that a modest improvement in the sensitivity of pulsar experiments ( due either to a longer time span or to the discovery of an intrinsically more stable pulsar ) might allow one to detect the confusion noise coming from a string network down to @xmath599 ( i.e. @xmath600 ) .",
    "evidently one should keep in mind that fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is drawn for an average cusp number @xmath459 . assuming a smaller value of @xmath377 , or even @xmath601 and considering only the smaller kink signals , will make it much more difficult for pulsar experiments to probe the existence of cosmic strings .",
    "we have studied in detail the amplitude , frequency spectrum , waveform and rate of occurrence of the high - frequency gravitational wave ( gw ) bursts emitted at cusps and kinks of a cosmological network of oscillating loops .",
    "our main tool in studying the waveform has been the factorization ( [ eq2.18 m ] ) of the fourier transform of the emitted gw amplitude .",
    "this factorization allowed us to conveniently extract from the waveform its physically meaningful , gauge - invariant content .",
    "[ this is why our waveforms differ from previous results @xcite which did not notice the gauge nature of the leading terms . ] in the time domain these waveforms correspond to power - law `` spikes '' @xmath602 ( @xmath603 for cusps ; and @xmath604 for kinks ) of linearly polarized gw s , with some smoothing of the center of the spike on time scales @xmath605 , where @xmath238 is the loop oscillation period and where @xmath188 is the misalignement between the center of the beam and the direction of emission .",
    "we estimated the rate of occurrence and the distribution in amplitude of the gw bursts emitted at cusps and kinks by using a simple model for the cosmic string network .",
    "when comparing our results with observations , one should keep in mind the simplifying assumptions involved in our model : ( i ) all loops born at time @xmath141 were assumed to have length @xmath606 with @xmath607 and @xmath608 .",
    "it is possible , however , that the loops have a broad length distribution @xmath609 and that the parameter @xmath354 characterizing the typical loop length be in the range @xmath610 .",
    "( ii ) we have also assumed that the loops are characterized by a single length scale , with no wiggliness on smaller scales .",
    "short - wavelength wiggles on scales @xmath611 are damped by gravitational back - reaction but some residual wiggliness may survive , thereby modifying the amplitude and the angular distribution of the gw bursts from cusps and kinks .",
    "( iii ) in many of our estimates we assumed the simple , uniform estimate ( [ eq5.1 ] ) for the space density of loops .",
    "this estimate is probably accurate in the matter era but is expected to be too small by a factor @xmath612 in the radiation era @xcite . in section  [ sec6 ]",
    "where the contribution to the confusion background of the radiation era was crucial we corrected the estimate ( [ eq5.1 ] ) by including the redshift - dependent factor ( [ eq6.18 ] ) .",
    "( iv ) finally , we disregarded the possibility of a nonzero cosmological constant which would introduce some quantitative changes in our estimates .",
    "as a general comment , let us recall that , though we tried to keep the important `` @xmath229 factors '' , our estimates have systematically neglected factors of order unity .    in our view",
    "the most important astrophysical results of the present investigation are the following : ( 1 ) the clear recognition of the strongly non gaussian nature of the string - generated gw background .",
    "the slow decrease with frequency of the gw burst signals means that there are occasional sharp bursts that stand above the `` confusion '' gw noise made of the superposition of the overlapping bursts .",
    "( 2 ) gw bursts from cusps might be detectable by the planned gw detectors ligo / virgo and lisa for a wide range of string tensions even if the average number of cusps per string oscillation is only @xmath470 . in spite of the argument",
    "@xcite that string reconnection can inhibit cusps ( which are generic for smooth loops @xcite ) , we find it plausible that @xmath470 or at least a few @xmath613 of the loops in the network will feature cusps . in view of the crucial importance of the average number of cusps for detection by ligo we recommend that new simulations be performed to determine this quantity .",
    "( 3 ) even if the number of cusps turns out to be very small , our estimate of the gw amplitude emitted by the ubiquitous kinks show that the space borne gw detector lisa has the potential of detecting gw bursts from kinks in a wide range of string tensions .",
    "( 4 ) finally , we show the need of a reanalysis of the constraints on @xmath456 derived from pulsar timing data . indeed , for such low frequencies the usual estimate , eq .",
    "( [ eq6.14 ] ) , of the gw stochastic background ( which neglects its non gaussianity ) seems to be quite inadequate because it averages on very rare , intense bursts .",
    "we have introduced a new , more relevant quantity , the confusion noise , eq .",
    "( [ eq6.16 ] ) , which averages only over the overlapping bursts . in the first approximation",
    ", we expect that the usually derived pulsar timing data limit on a gaussian stochastic background ( often expressed as a limit @xmath614 ) will entail essentially the same limit on the _ confusion _ part , eq.([eq6.16 ] ) , of the gw stochastic background , i.e. we expect that the real pulsar limit on @xmath2 will be the weaker constraint @xmath615 .",
    "our rather crude approximations do not allow us to transform this relaxed limit in a precise limit on @xmath2 .",
    "however , we expect that our results render a gut - like value @xmath616 compatible with pulsar data , even if @xmath617 ( and probably easily compatible with @xmath616 if @xmath377 is @xmath618 or less )",
    ". however , we emphasized that there are still occasional bursts that complicate the analysis and call for an improved treatment .",
    "until such a careful analysis is done , together with a precise estimate of the number of cusps in a string network , one can not use pulsar data to set precise limits on @xmath456 .    for a review of string properties and evolution , and references to original work ,",
