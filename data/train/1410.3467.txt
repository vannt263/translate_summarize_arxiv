    ", we explore one such channel by investigating whether or not sufficient @xmath0-process material can be synthesized in the first star clusters formed within the first @xmath4 after big bang via dynamically assembled merging compact binaries @xcite . to answer this question",
    ", we first estimate the formation rate of nuclear star cluster in the early universe as well as their structural properties , which we use to compute detailed estimates of the rate of compact object encounters within such systems ( section [ sec : ass ] ) . from the stellar binary merger rate , we then derive the amount of @xmath0-process material assembled in the early universe using the typical mass production rate per event , which is addressed in detail for compact binary encounters in section [ sec : rp ] .",
    "discussion and conclusions are presented in section [ sec : dis ] .",
    "the basic assumption of our modeling is that compact star clusters can be formed at the center of high-@xmath1 dark - matter halos with virial temperature @xmath5 and non - zero but very low metallicity @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , under these conditions disk fragmentation can be suppressed and gas efficiently funneled by the toomre instability in the innermost few parsecs where it forms a star cluster ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .    to estimate the formation rate of early forming compact and high - density star clusters , we derive the formation rate of dark matter ( dm ) halos meeting the criteria above from the simulations of @xcite , which focus on early chemical enrichment of three milky way - like halos with dm mass @xmath7 .",
    "the simulations have been carried out using @xmath8 dm particles in a comoving volume of @xmath9 , with dm mass resolution of @xmath10 .",
    "the dm only simulation is post - processed with the star formation and chemical enrichment model described in @xcite and @xcite , which includes treatment of metal outflows and radiative feedback in the lyman - werner bands to regulate population iii formation @xcite .    because , as shown in section  [ sec : rates ] , the encounter rate in the core of the first star clusters declines significantly at redshifts @xmath11 ( mainly due to a decrease in the central density ) , we focus only on systems formed before then , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . by @xmath12 , a total of @xmath13 clusters",
    "are expected to be formed in a region that will collapse by @xmath14 in a milky way  like halo .",
    "this number is higher by a factor of about two when compared to the formation rate of similar objects in a random region of the universe , owing to the enhanced dm halo formation rate induced by the over dense environment ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "overall our simplified approach provides a robust estimate of the formation rate of halos capable of hosting dense star clusters .",
    "for example , feedback at @xmath15 is unlikely to affect gas in halos with @xmath16 k. this leaves the leading source of uncertainty in the details of star formation in such halos , which are very challenging to model from first principles ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , as a first characterization , we describe the internal properties of first stellar clusters at @xmath17 following @xcite . from fig .  4 in @xcite we derive the characteristic stellar mass @xmath18 and half - mass radius @xmath19 for the central star clusters as a function of their formation redshift .",
    "while the core density during initial stages of cluster evolution is fairly uncertain and dependent upon the initial conditions , as a basic estimate , based on direct n - body modeling experiments @xcite , we assume a typical core to half mass radius ratio @xmath20 and a core to characteristic stellar mass ratio @xmath21 , corresponding to a pre - core collapse cluster with a @xmath22  @xcite profile . with the model ( in virial equilibrium )",
    ", we derive the central velocity dispersion from the cluster mass and radius : @xmath23    having an estimate for the mass and velocity dispersion of a cluster ( fig .",

    "next , we estimate the fraction of these nss that are retained in the cluster core . the core retention fraction is affected by ns natal kicks , binary and mass segregation .",
    "we assume that the progenitors of nss are generally in binaries , since massive stars are expected to form with high binarity @xcite , and use the model of ( * ? ? ?",
    "12 ) to estimate the retention of nss formed in clusters with different escape velocities .",
    "we consider a maxwellian kick distribution , @xmath36 , with @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which are the fastest kick distribution studied by @xcite . since that study concludes that even with their optimistic assumptions they might underestimate actual retention fraction ( section 7 in @xcite ) , our approach is fairly conservative .",
    "we assume a cluster escape speed @xmath39 as derived from the king density profile . in what follows",
    "we will assume that 50% of the retained nss are unbound from their parent binary while 50% remain bound , as roughly found by @xcite for the range of cluster s escape velocities derived here .",
    "mass segregation can enhance the number of nss and ns - progenitors in the core relative to the cluster mean . from n - body simulations with stellar evolution ( macleod et al . 2015 , in preparation ) , we see that mass segregation of the ns progenitors is efficient ( core density increased by @xmath40 ) , but the core density of nss is increased only by @xmath41 , owing to the redistribution following natal kick .",
    "we thus apply this latter correction factor ( that is @xmath42 ) to map global to core retention fraction ( @xmath43 ) , which is then shown in panel d of fig .",
    "@xmath44 for fast kicks ( @xmath38 ) at all redshifts , while for the distribution with slower kicks @xmath45 at @xmath46 , decreasing to @xmath47 by @xmath48 .      to calculate the encounter rate within the cluster we assume nss are distributed homogeneously within the core , with fractional number @xmath49 , total number density @xmath50 , and binary fraction @xmath51 .",
    "we further assume that the stars follow a maxwellian velocity distribution function with dispersion @xmath52 .",
    "we calculate a fiducial encounter rate @xmath53 for individual clusters provided a distance of closest approach @xmath54 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ,    @xmath55    to estimate the rate of single - single ns encounters , we multiply by the single ns fraction squared , @xmath56 , where the factor of @xmath57 avoids double counting pairwise encounters . to estimate binary - single encounters",
    ", we must include a factor @xmath58 . to form a binary by transferring orbital energy to internal stellar oscillations",
    ", we adopt the cross section for tidal capture formalism described in @xcite and @xcite , which in the case of nss give @xmath59 @xcite . to compute the cross section for binary formation by gw radiation , we follow @xcite .",
    "that is : @xmath60 this is significantly larger than @xmath61 .",
    "although , as we show in section  [ sec : rp ] , tidal capture encounters eject significantly more @xmath0-process material .    finally , we consider encounters between one binary containing a ns with a single ns leading to an exchange , and subsequent formation of a ns - ns pair . using exchange cross sections from @xcite , the cross section for a @xmath62 ns to exchange into a binary given an equal mass companion is @xmath63 .",
    "if the eccentricity is sufficiently high , the pair will merge on a short timescale @xcite . to calculate the cross section for the formation of ns binaries with lifetime less than 1 gyr ,",
    "we use the lifetime estimate @xmath64 and assume thermal distribution of eccentricity , @xmath65 , following the exchange @xcite .",
    "thus , for any binary semimajor axis , @xmath66 , there is a critical eccentricity @xmath67 above which newly formed binaries will merge in less than 1 gyr .",
    "the fraction of binaries with @xmath68 is thus @xmath69 and scales as @xmath70 .",
    "the resultant cross section scales weakly with binary semimajor axis , @xmath71 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", the integrated cross - section can be expressed as @xmath74 in equation  [ eq : colrate ] . , or a turnoff age of @xmath75myr ) then the effective exchange cross section is reduced @xcite , but if an exchange occurs , the resultant binary is typically tighter by a factor of @xmath76",
    ". both of these effects play a role in determining the cross section for rapidly merging ns binaries . under these assumptions",
    "@xmath77 , a factor of @xmath78 smaller than equation [ rmin3body ] . ]    equipped with @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , we can calculate the binary assembly rate @xmath53 for individual clusters ( equation  [ eq : colrate ] ) as a function of their formation redshift , which , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , sets their structural properties .",
    "the rates for tidal , gw captured and dynamically formed binaries within individual clusters are given in panel a of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where we assume @xmath82 . as expected , tidal encounters are very rare and the rate is dominated by binary - single interactions , which have been proposed as viable merger channel by several studies @xcite . in this work we ignore binary - binary encounters and their exchange products , which will represent , at most , a contribution of order unity to the binary - single encounter rate .",
    "an estimate of the integrated encounter rate @xmath83 over all the milky way central star clusters present at high @xmath1 can then be made under the assumption that each cluster contributes to the encounter rate from its redshift of formation until its dissolution .",
    "conservatively , we assume that dissolution happens @xmath84 after cluster formation , although some clusters may well survive for longer and therefore provide additional contribution to the encounter rate ( @xmath85 ) and we note that compact binaries will survive cluster tidal dissolution if that happens before the merger . ] .",
    "our estimate of @xmath83 for dynamically formed binaries as a function of @xmath1 is shown in panel b of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . from this panel",
    "it is possible to compute the total number of mergers ( which will follow within 1 gyr after binary capture ) in the milky way by integrating the rate over time . in panel c of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we also plot for clarity the fraction of high-@xmath1 star clusters that experienced a merger as a function of @xmath1 derived by dividing the number of expected mergers by the number of clusters present . to calculate the total amount of @xmath0-process material synthesized in these clusters we need to combine the rate calculations presented here with an estimate of the mass production rate per event .",
    "it is to this issue that we now turn our attention .",
    "the physical conditions that characterized the decompressed ejecta from compact binary mergers @xcite are compatible with the assembly of an @xmath0-process pattern that is generally consistent with solar system abundances @xcite .",
    "the most recent numerical studies of circular ( i.e. , zero - eccentricity ) compact binary mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows that they eject about @xmath86 of @xmath0-process material @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these circular mergers , eccentric mergers ( i.e. , with finite eccentricity ) can result in tidal tails that will synthesize significantly larger masses of @xmath0-process rich material @xcite .",
    "but in order for them to offer a consequential enhancement to standard circular mergers , the synthesized @xmath0-process mass should be higher by a factor of about @xmath87 when compared to circular @xmath0-process production .",
    "this requirement can be written as @xmath88    for the two binary members to come together and eventually merge , they must lose orbital angular momentum and energy .",
    "this can be achieved through gravitational wave emission , or mass ejection , or a combination of both .",
    "the tidal interaction provides an efficient mechanism for merging by ejecting a small amount of mass through the formation of tidal tails that carry a great deal of angular momentum to a large radius . in the case of a tidal capture ,",
    "it is easier to dynamically unbind matter to infinity and , as a result , the amount of mass ejected is larger than in a merger by about one order of magnitude . in the case displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , @xmath89 with @xmath90 . since @xmath91",
    ", circular binary mergers arising from binary exchange1/108 of the exchanges will result in eccentric merging binaries @xcite . ] and gw capture should dominate the @xmath0-process mass production in high-@xmath1 stellar clusters . in what follows",
    "we thus neglect the contribution of eccentric mergers .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the final elemental abundances in the tidal tails of a merging neutron star binary from @xcite are compared with those of an eccentric binary resulting from the tidal capture of a neutron star by a black hole , both using the fps equation of state @xcite .",
    "the model results are also compared with observed elemental abundances of the cemp-@xmath0 star cs 22892 - 052 @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the nuclear composition in the tails is followed using the nuclear reaction network described in @xcite , but symmetric fission has been assumed .",
    "all models assumed @xmath92 .",
    "the models lack light @xmath0-process elements due to the extremely neutron - rich conditions encountered in the tidal ejecta and because we do not follow the disk formed after merger @xcite .",
    "for the second and third @xmath0-process peaks , our abundance distribution is reasonably consistent with that seen in cemp-@xmath0 stars @xcite .",
    "the origin of the remaining discrepancy is likely due to the unsettled nuclear physics employed , in particular to the uncertainties in the fission rates and daughter distributions , and because @xmath93 is unconstrained by the merger models used in this work .",
    "having established the amount of mass of @xmath0-process material produced by both mergers and tidal captures we can now proceed to determine the relevance of dynamically assembled binaries in enriching cemp-@xmath0 stars with eu .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the cumulative mass of @xmath0-process material as a function of @xmath1 synthesized in binary mergers , as calculated from the results shown in fig .",
    "typical model uncertainties of @xmath94 are shown as the blue shaded region .",
    "for comparison we have plotted the contribution of type ii sn , calculated assuming a mass production rate of @xmath95 , which is the average mass required per event in order for core collapse to be solely responsible for the @xmath0-process in the milky way @xcite . in accordance with the higher level of scatter of [ eu / fe ] in relation to [ @xmath96/fe ] ,",
    "which is most pronounced at values below [ fe / h]@xmath97 - 2.0 , we have assumed that only a 5% of all type ii that produce @xmath96-elements also yield @xmath0-process elements @xcite .",
    "fig ,  [ fig5 ] shows that in high-@xmath1 clusters , albeit with large uncertainties , dynamically assembled mergers could be potentially as important as type ii sne . because they happen only in a few clusters ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , we expect high concentrations of @xmath0-processes in locations where a binary merger happens compared to a case where type - ii sne are assumed to be the main source of the @xmath0-process .",
    "we estimate that ns - ns merger blastwaves do not carry enough energy and momentum to escape their host minihalo .",
    "however , the short halo assembly time at high-@xmath1 implies that there is significant mixing because of halo mergers , leading to an enhancement of @xmath0-process by a factor @xmath98 ( for @xmath99 ) in a few percent of the stars formed at @xmath100 .",
    "this can help explain the large star - to - star bulk scatter in the concentrations of heavy elements with respect to the lighter metals in cemp-@xmath0 stars @xcite .",
    "studies of element abundances in the oldest and most fe deficient stars in our galaxy have concluded that , because neutron - star binary timescales are long ( @xmath101 myr ) , only sne could have contributed to @xmath0-process synthesis at the earliest times ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , recent hydrodynamical simulation studies have shown that assuming a relatively small time interval between the formation of the galaxy and appearance of stars with [ fe / h]@xmath102 is not accurate @xcite and that in fact neutron star mergers offer a favorable alternative to type ii sne as the @xmath0-process site .",
    "for cemp-@xmath0 stars , which are considered the chemical descendants of population iii stars @xcite , any @xmath0-process enhancement must happen on a timescale shorter than that of pollution from a second generation of stars .",
    "dynamically assembled binaries resulting in a short - lived merger can fit these requirements better than the standard compact mergers , whose formation timescale is determined by binary stellar evolution and is estimated to be @xmath101 myrs @xcite .",
    "their production rate in high-@xmath1 clusters , as calculated in section  [ sec : rates ] , could attain a sufficiently high value for compact binary mergers to still be a potentially viable source of heavy @xmath0-process material in cemp-@xmath0 stars .",
