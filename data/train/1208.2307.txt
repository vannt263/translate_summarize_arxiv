    "kicked off by the experimental observation of the graphene quantum hall effect @xcite , fascination with massless dirac fermions is mounting , where they appear not only in graphene but more generically in various systems such as organic metals @xcite , cold atom systems in optical lattices @xcite and molecular graphene @xcite . among these systems ,",
    "the number of massless dirac fermions is always even for solid state materials , which is called the ",
    "fermion doubling \" @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "manipulation of dirac cones into single cones has been theoretically considered @xcite , which may be realizable in optical lattices where the hall conductivity is detectable experimentally @xcite .    inspired by these ,",
    "we explore here the effect of disorder for the landau levels of massless dirac fermions , in particular in the absence of the fermion doubling .",
    "specifically , the effect on the @xmath0 landau level , which is essential to the anomalous hall effect of massless dirac fermions , is examined from the viewpoint of the fermion doubling and the symmetry of the system . in our previous work @xcite , we have shown that the @xmath0 landau level of the honeycomb lattice ( graphene ) becomes anomalously sharp even in the presence of disorder , if the disorder respects the chiral symmetry and is spatially correlated over a distance exceeding a few lattice constants .",
    "conversely , we have also pointed out that when the disorder is spatially uncorrelated , the @xmath0 landau level is broadened just like the other landau levels , even if the chiral symmetry is respected by the disorder .    to explore the single - to - double dirac cone crossover , here we consider a two - dimensional lattice model having two dirac cones which are shifted in energy with each other as in the model proposed by watanabe et al .",
    "we examine numerically the effect of disorder with this lattice model , and have found that , even if the disorder is uncorrelated in space , the @xmath0 landau levels start to become anomalously sharp as the two dirac cones are energetically shifted .",
    "notably , the anomalous sharpness in the absence of the fermion doubling occurs when the disorder respects the chiral symmetry for each cone .",
    "in fact , a potential disorder , which breaks the chiral symmetry , washes out the sharpness .",
    "we adopt here a two - dimensional square lattice with the following nearest - neighbor ( nn ) @xmath1 and the next nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) @xmath2 transfer integrals , @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the lattice points and @xmath5 the unit vector in @xmath6 direction with all lengths measured in units of the lattice constant . to realize shifted dirac cones some transfer energies have to be complex , and here the nnn transfer is pure imaginary .",
    "although complex transfer integrals may seem unrealistic , they can be realized in cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite . in the absence of a magnetic field ,",
    "the hamiltonian in the momentum space is expressed as @xmath7\\ ] ] where @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 with the primitive vectors taken to be @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in this model",
    ", we have two dirac cones at @xmath13 with energies @xmath14 , so that the two dirac cones are shifted in energy from each other when the strength @xmath2 is non - zero .",
    "a magnetic field is introduced by taking the peierls substitution @xmath15 , where the summation of the phases @xmath16 along a closed loop is equal to the magnetic flux enclosed by it in units of @xmath17 .",
    "we introduce a random component @xmath18 for the nn transfer integral @xmath19 that has a gaussian distribution with variance @xmath20 and is _ uncorrelated _ in space @xmath21 .",
    "still , this disorder preserves the chiral symmetry for each dirac cone .",
    "the bond disorder considered in our previous work @xcite is equivalent to the present disorder in the limit of zero correlation length .",

    "is shown in fig.[fig2 ] , where both @xmath0 and @xmath24 landau levels are split as the two dirac cones are energetically shifted with the increase of @xmath2 .",
    "remarkably , the @xmath0 ( zero - mode ) landau level for each cone becomes anomalously sharper with @xmath2 even in the presence of disorder , while the @xmath24 landau levels remain broadened . for comparison",

    "the magnetic flux piercing each square plaquette is @xmath26 and the strength of disorder @xmath27 .",

    "we have numerically investigated the effect of disorder on the landau levels of the massless dirac fermions with and without the fermion doubling .",
    "we have clearly shown that , if the chiral symmetry for dirac cones is respected , the zero energy ( @xmath0 ) landau level becomes anomalously sharp in the absence of the fermion doubling even when the disorder is uncorrelated in space .",
    "since the shift in energy of the dirac cones suppresses the mixing between the dirac points due to the disorder scattering , the present result implies that the broadening reported for uncorrelated disorder in the honeycomb lattice ( graphene ) @xcite is due to the mixing between the two dirac fermions with opposite chirality .",
