    "in recent years there has been significant interest in the pion and kaon _",
    "photo- _ and _ electroproduction _ off the nucleon .",
    "several excellent experimental programs exploring these reactions in the _ resonance region _ have been performed at mami , mit bates , bnl , and jefferson lab . to extract the resonance properties from the experimental data a number of sophisticated tools",
    "have been developed over the past decade .",
    "most widely exploited are the _ partial - wave _ photoproduction _ solutions _ said  @xcite and maid  @xcite , _ k - matrix models _",
    "@xcite , and _ dynamical models _ , such as dmt  @xcite , the model of sato and lee  @xcite , gross and surya model  @xcite , and a number of others  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a new dynamical model for _ pion photoproduction_. it is an extension of our model of pion - nucleon ( @xmath9n ) interaction  @xcite to include the electromagnetic interaction in a way consistent with the watson theorem  @xcite and current conservation .",
    "the framework is based on solving a bethe - salpeter type of equation for the scattering amplitude in the channel space spanned by @xmath0 and @xmath1 states . as in the @xmath9n case we use the _ equal - time _ ( instanteneous ) quasipotential reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "the driving force of the equation to lowest order in interactions is given by single - particle exchange graphs .",
    "here we will restrict our discussion to the force given by the single nucleon , pion , @xmath3- and @xmath10-meson , and @xmath11(1232)-resonance exchanges .",
    "in comparing with other approaches based on the hadron - exchange dynamics we note that they differ mainly in the use of relativistic dynamics and the renormalisation procedures .",
    "our model bares close analogies to the relativistic model developed by gross and surya  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to their work , we do not approximate the hadron exchanges in the @xmath12- and @xmath13-channel by a separable interaction . as a result the integral equation for the @xmath0 amplitude can be solved only numerically , and hence the task of solving the model is more technically involved .",
    "our models are also different in the choice of quasipotential reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation  equal - time _ vs. _ pion spectator .",
    "there are important differences of our model with the dmt model .",
    "first of all , the dressed resonance - exchanges in the @xmath14-channel are represented by a breit - wigner form with `` unitarity phases '' which need to be fitted to the condition of watson s theorem . in our model these contributions are generated dynamically .",
    "this has an advantage of satisfying watson s theorem automatically .",
    "also , the resonance parameters , apart from the electromagnetic couplings , are thus fully constrained by the @xmath9n interaction and need not to be fitted separately .",
    "second major difference is again in the choice of relativistic dynamics  dmt model exploits the kadyshevsky quasipotential reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "sato and lee  @xcite apply the hamiltonian approach and the method of unitary transformations which makes it difficult to compare directly to the bethe - salpeter type of approach .",
    "the generic feature that distinguishes the two is that in the quantum - mechanical hamiltonian description the particles are always on the mass shell and intermediate particles are off the energy shell , while in the field - theoretic desription it is the other way around .",
    "another difference is that sato and lee do not perform any renormalizations of the dressed baryon - pole contributions .    in this paper",
    "we shall only briefly present the framework and the results for the photoproduction multipoles .",
    "the results for the pion - photoproduction observables as well as the extension to electroproduction of pions will appear in subsequent publications , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section we briefly summarize the usual arguments for inclusion of the @xmath0 final state interaction in the @xmath9 photoproduction reactions . in sect .",
    "iii we construct the pion - photoproduction potential with emphasis on satisfiyng the gauge - invariance constraints . in sect .",
    "iv the renormalization of the pole terms of the photoproduction amplitude is described . in sect .",
    "v we present some numerical results for the pion - photoproduction multipoles and discussion . sect .",
    "vi concludes the paper .",
    "to include the photon in a way preserving unitarity in the channel space spanned by the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states we consider the following four processes :    lr nn , & n n , + n n , &",

    "the propagators @xmath21 and @xmath22 are , respectively , the pion - nucleon and photon - nucleon two - particle propagators . with the assumption of hermiticity of the potential and time - reversal symmetry which in particular relates the @xmath19 and @xmath18 amplitudes ,",
    "leads to an exactly unitary @xmath23-matrix , @xmath24 , in the defined channel space .",
    "since iterations of the potentials involving the photon give rise to the small electromagnetic corrections , one can simplify the equation by keeping only the leading order in the electric charge @xmath25 .",

    "the parameters have been fitted to the -scattering partial - wave analysis data . in the present work",
    "we obtain the photoproduction amplitude from ( diagrammatically shown in ) using exactly the same quasipotential approach and the amplitude as in ref .",
    "the only free parameters in this calculation will be the electromagnetic couplings of hadrons entering the driving force @xmath26 , all the rest is fixed through the analysis of scattering .",
    "our resulting photoproduction amplitude obeys the _ watson theorem _",
    "@xcite , which relates the phase of the photoproduction amplitude to the elastic phase shift @xmath27 : t _ =    determined in terms of the on - shell @xmath0 amplitude .",

    "the situation is complicated by the fact the the photon couples minimally and hence the vertices fulfill the ward - takahashi ( wt ) identities :    & & q__nn^(p,p)= s_n^-1 ( p ) - s_n^-1 ( p ) , + & & q__^(k,k)=s_^-1 ( k ) - s_^-1 ( k ) .    nonetheless , using these identities , it is easy to see that a cancellation among the nucleon , pion and the kr contact term contributions leads to ( 4 ) q _",

    "therefore , the current is conserved up to the terms proportional to the inverse propagators of the external particles , and hence is exactly conserved when the external particles are on the mass shell .",
    "a problem arises when we would like to include the _ sideways _ form factors , i.e. , cutoff functions dependent on the 4-momentum of the exchanged particle .",
    "obviously , simply introducing them into the pion and nucleon exchange graphs , as we have done it for the potential in  @xcite , will destroy the current conservation .",
    "the cancellation among the graphs does not anymore take place .",
    "the easiest way to implement such cutoff form factors without loss of current conservation is to perform the minimal substitution on the form factors themselves .",
    "we follow essentially the method of gross and riska  @xcite .",
    "we use the fact that our sideways form factors depend exclusively on the momentum of the exchanged particle and hence it makes no difference whether to include the form factor into the vertex function or the inverse form factor squared into the propagator . in the latter case",

    "the results are compared with the data from the partial - wave solutions of berends and donnachie @xcite and said  @xcite .    the electromagnetic coupling parameters used in the calculation are given in table  , with @xmath79 gev , @xmath80 .",
    "only the @xmath11-isobar electromagnetic couplings @xmath81 and @xmath82 were adjusted to for the best description of the resonant multipoles : @xmath83 and @xmath50 . in the figures",
    "we have plotted the results for the central values of these paramaters , given in bold in table  .",
    "the other multipoles are very weakly sensitive to the @xmath11 isobar contribution ( recall that the spin-1/2 backgrounds are absent in our model because of the specific form of the @xmath29 vertex ) .",

    "it is reassuring that without need to fit any parameters we obtained a reasonable agreement with experiment in all the channels .",
    "it is also good to see that the effect of the fsi is small for the charged pion - photoproduction and significant for the @xmath84 channels in analogy with the chiral loop effect of the new let .",
    "thus , our results at threshold are in at least qualitative agreement with chpt .",
    "they also are in reasonable quantitative agreement with experiment , and for the @xmath84 production are even in better agreement than the `` new let '' result .",
    "although , it should be noted that in a more complete calculation , including higher order effects and counter - terms , chpt is in better agreement with experiment than our simple model .",
    "one can of course try to improve the model by including higher - order contact terms in the photoproduction potential .",
    "we however have not done that . our main aim is to apply the model in the resonance region where chpt is not applicable ( yet ) .",
    "in particular , in the @xmath11-resonance region we have been able to extract the coupling constants of the @xmath85 transition .",
    "a quantity of interest here is the ratio of the electric ( @xmath86 ) and magnetic ( @xmath87 ) @xmath85 transition strength : @xmath88 .",
    "the physical significance of these value is attributed to the deformation of the nucleon , see e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in a naive quark model where the nucleon consists of three constituent quarks in the sphere - shape @xmath23 state  the @xmath89 ratio vanishes .    in terms of the @xmath29-vertex parameters in our model",
    "the e2/m1 ratio is defined as ( cf .",
    "appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite ) : r_em= 100% . using the `` bare '' values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 in table  , we estimate this ratio to be r_em^(bare ) = ( 3.8 1.6)% . we should immediately note that this value only seems to be inconsistent with pdg value  @xcite : @xmath90 , the reason being that the pdg analyses define this ratio as the ratio of corresponding resonant multipoles : r_em^(multipoles ) = 100% . in our model",
    "we obtain @xmath91 , and @xmath92 ( in units of @xmath93 ) at the @xmath11 resonance position ( _ i.e. _ , where re@xmath94 re@xmath95 ) .",
    "therefore , we have r_em^(multipoles ) = ( -2.60.6 ) % which is consistent with the pdg value .    the definition , however , is equivalent to only assuming the that the on - mass - shell renormalized values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 are used in .",
    "our result that the `` bare '' e2/m1 ratio is , in fact , small and _ positive _ is in agreement with other dynamical models  @xcite , which allows us to believe that the model - dependence in the extraction of this quantity in a dynamical modeling is rather mild and should be pursued further .",
    "we have extended the dynamical modeling of the pion - nucleon system in the first resonance region  @xcite to the process of pion photoproduction on the nucleon .",
    "such extension is indispensable in testing the @xmath0 dynamics beyond the elastic @xmath0 scattering .",
    "the presented numerical results are obtained in the model which satisfies unitarity in the @xmath96 channel space to the leading order in the electromagnetic coupling , and hence watson s theorem is exactly fulfilled .",
    "we find that the model description of the pion - photoproduction multipoles is in overall agreement with the partial - wave analyses in the region from the threshold up to 650 mev photon lab energy .",
    "we have therefore developed a realistic hadron - exchange model describing the the low and intermediate energy pion scattering and photoproduction on the nucleon in a unitary fashion .",
    "the model treats the quantum effects due to pion - nucleon loops in a lorentz - covariant framework .",
    "it can be extended to higher energies by including more reaction channels .",
    "furthermore , it is fully compatible and complementary to the relativistic meson - exchange models for the few - nucleon system , and hence can naturally be embedded in these models to describe more complicated processes .",
    "the results for the threshold electric dipoles of the charged pion photoproduction are very close to the low - energy theorem ( let ) prediction and in a reasonable agreement with experiment .",
    "in contrast , the electric dipole for the neutral pion photoproduction off the proton , receives a sizable correction due to the final state interaction and which improves the agreement with experimental as compared to lets .",
    "this correction is found to be in a qualitative agreement with the large chiral - loop correction to let known from chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "the two parameters of the @xmath29 vertex , which essentially are the only free parameters of the model , were fitted to @xmath8 and @xmath7 multipoles from the said solution . in future",
    "we plan to extract these parameters directly from experimental data . at present",
    ", the e2/m1 ratio obtained in the model is equal to @xmath97 % for the `` bare '' value and to @xmath98 for the physical value .",
    "this is consistent with other analyses based on dynamical models . the precise value of this ratio is model - dependent as it is sensitive on the details of the @xmath0 final state interaction .",
    "the only possibility to extract this value is a model - independent way would be by using chpt with explicit @xmath11 degrees of freedom .",
    "it would be extremely useful to carry out such analysis .",

    "<S> we present a relativistic dynamical model of pion photoproduction on the nucleon in the resonance region . </S>",
    "<S> it offers several advances over the existing approaches . </S>",
    "<S> the model is obtained by extending our @xmath0-scattering description to the electromagnetic channels . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting photopion amplitude is thus unitary in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 channel space , watson s theorem is exactly satisfied . at this stage </S>",
    "<S> we have included the pion , nucleon , @xmath2-resonance degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 and @xmath4 meson exchanges are also included , but play a minor role in the considered energy domain ( up to @xmath5 gev ) . in this energy </S>",
    "<S> range the model provides a good description of all the important multipoles . </S>",
    "<S> we have allowed for only two free parameters  the photocouplings of the @xmath6-resonance . </S>",
    "<S> these couplings are adjusted to reproduce the strength of corresponding resonant - multipoles @xmath7 and @xmath8 at the resonance position . </S>"
