    "the conclusion is that for low temperatures the effect of @xmath216 is much more important than the effect of h. this is the main reason for the increased violations out of equilibrium . on the other hand , as the temperature increases the effect of @xmath216 vanishes , which is not surprising since the population of each eigenstate tends to @xmath228 , while the effect of @xmath194 remains .",
    "this is the reason why moving away from equilibrium reduces the maximum violation to the lgi for high temperatures .    to justify the numerical calculations , we approximate at first order @xmath229 , that is valid for the limit of @xmath230",
