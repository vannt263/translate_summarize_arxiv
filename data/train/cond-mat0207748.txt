    "fluctuations of the order parameter near the critical temperature @xmath4 are much larger in high-@xmath4 superconductors than in classical low temperature superconductors .",

    "the region of critical fluctuations was estimated from the ginzburg criterion to be of the order of 1k , or more , around @xmath4 , which renders the critical region accessible to experimental investigations.@xcite farther above @xmath4 , one expects to observe the transition from critical to noninteracting gaussian fluctuations which are the lowest order fluctuation corrections to the mean field theory.@xcite    the layered structure of high-@xmath4 superconductors requires some theoretical sophistication .",
    "one could treat these superconductors with various models from three - dimensional ( 3d ) anisotropic to coupled layers lawrence - doniach , or purely two - dimensional ( _ 2d _ ) ones . due to the temperature variation of the coherence lengths",
    "one could even expect a dimensional crossover in some systems .",

    "@xcite most of them used @xmath6 resistivity measurements .",

    "it has been shown that , in a wide temperature range above @xmath4 , the fluctuation conductivity did not follow any of the single exponent power laws predicted by scaling and mean - field theories.@xcite the data in the gaussian regime could be fitted by an expression derived within the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory with a short wavelength cutoff in the fluctuation spectrum .",
    "recently , silva et al.@xcite have proven that the gl approach with an appropriate choice of the cutoff parameter yields result which is identical to that of the microscopic aslamazov - larkin ( al ) approach with reduced excitations of the short wavelength fluctuations.@xcite it has been further shown that the detailed temperature dependence of the fluctuation conductivity was not universal , but sample dependent . in this respect ,",
    "the gl approach has practical advantage since the cutoff parameter can be readily adjusted in fitting the experimental data .",
    "silva et al.@xcite could fit very well the data on a number of thin films in the gaussian region from @xmath4 + 1 k to @xmath4 + 25 k.    when critical fluctuations are studied , it becomes essential to know accurately the value of @xmath4 .",
    "however , the determination of @xmath4 from @xmath6 resistivity measurements brings about some uncertainties .",

    "the correct value of the critical temperature can be determined as an additional fitting parameter in the analysis of the fluctuation conductivity .",
    "usually one assumes that a well defined power law holds in a given narrow temperature range and then determine both , @xmath4 and the critical exponent from the selected segment.@xcite however , the experimental data usually show an almost continuous change of the slope so that the uncertainty in the determination of @xmath4 is an unsolved problem . besides",
    ", the effects of the cutoff have been neglected in the analysis of the data close to @xmath4 .",
    "even though the values of the fluctuation conductivity near @xmath4 are not much affected by the introduction of the cutoff , the slopes can be considerably changed,@xcite and the analysis may become uncertain .    a number of microwave studies have been reported showing clear signs of fluctuations in both , the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath0 conductivity.@xcite the real part @xmath8 of the complex conductivity @xmath9 has a sharp peak at @xmath4 , which is not observed in e.g. nb as a representative of low temperature classical superconductors .",
    "@xcite the salient feature of the @xmath0 case is that the fluctuation conductivity does not diverge at @xmath4 because a finite frequency provides a limit to the observation of the critical slowing down near @xmath4 .",

    "it is also important to note that @xmath8 and @xmath10 have individually different temperature and frequency dependences , even though they result from the same underlying physics . testing",
    "a given theoretical model becomes more stringent when two curves have to be fitted with the same set of parameters .",
    "the expressions for the @xmath0 fluctuation conductivity in the gaussian regime have been deduced within the time dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) theory by schmidt.@xcite using general physical arguments , fisher , fisher , and huse @xcite provided a formulation for the scaling of the complex @xmath0 conductivity as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the correlation length , @xmath13 is the dynamical critical exponent , @xmath14 is the dimensionality of the system , and @xmath15 are some complex scaling functions above and below @xmath4 .",
    "this form of the fluctuation conductivity was claimed to hold in both , the gaussian and critical regimes .",
    "dorsey @xcite has deduced the scaling functions in the gaussian regime above @xmath4 , and verified the previous results of schmidt.@xcite more recently , wickham and dorsey @xcite have shown that even in the critical regime , where the quartic term in the gl free energy plays a role , the scaling functions preserve the same form as in the gaussian regime .",
    "the above mentioned theoretical expressions of the @xmath0 fluctuation conductivity did not take into account the slow variation approximation which is required for the validity of the ginzburg - landau theory.@xcite it was noted long time ago that the summation over the fluctuation modes had to be truncated at a wavevector which corresponded roughly to the inverse of the intrinsic coherence length @xmath16.@xcite the improved treatment with a short wavelegth cutoff was applied in fluctuation diamagnetism,@xcite and @xmath6 paraconductivity far above @xmath4.@xcite this approach was also applied in @xmath6 fluctuation conductivity of high-@xmath4 superconductors where one encounters a large anisotropy.@xcite the introduction of the short wavelength cutoff was found to be essential in fitting the theoretical expressions to the experimental data . in view of the great potential of the microwave method described above",

    "values of @xmath1 larger than @xmath3 were observed experimentally,@xcite but were attributed to an unusually large dynamic critical exponent . also , deviation of the scaling in the variable @xmath17 was observed already at 2 k above @xmath4,@xcite but no analysis was made considering the short wavelength cutoff in the fluctuation spectrum .",
