    "in july 2012 , both the atlas and the cms collaborations have reported the discovery of a new boson with a mass of about 126 gev  @xcite .",
    "this particle has been observed in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes , and those event numbers are compatible with that in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "thus , the new particle is most likely the sm - like higgs boson .",
    "however , this does not necessarily mean that the higgs sector in the sm is correct , because the sm - like higgs boson can also appear in the higgs sector extended from the sm one .",
    "on the other hand , it has been known that there are phenomena which can not be explained in the sm such as neutrino oscillations , the existence of dark matter and baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "these phenomena are expected to be explained in models beyond the sm where extended higgs sectors are often introduced , and their properties strongly depend on the new physics scenario .",
    "therefore , determining the structure of the higgs sector is paramountly important to know what kind of the new physics models exists .",
    "the two higgs doublet model ( thdm ) is one of the most popular and extensively analyzed extended higgs sector .",
    "there are several scenarios of the thdm depending on the type of a discrete @xmath2 symmetry  @xcite which is basically introduced to avoid the tree level flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) ; @xmath3 the cases where the @xmath2 symmetry is unbroken , softly - broken and/or explicitly - broken .",
    "the first case is known to be the inert doublet model  @xcite in which the lightest @xmath2-odd scalar boson can be dark matter . in the second class of the thdm",
    ", there are four independent types of yukawa interactions , depending on the charge assignments of the @xmath2 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the collider phenomenology can be drastically different among the four types of the yukawa interactions  @xcite .",
    "the third scenario where the @xmath2 symmetry is explicitly broken is so - called the type - iii thdm . in this case , a particular yukawa texture is introduced , forcing the non - diagonal yukawa couplings to be proportional to the geometric mean of the two fermion masses  @xcite . as the other way to forbid the tree level fcnc , one can assume that one of the two yukawa matrices is proportional to the other one , which is called as the aligned thdm  @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of the sm - like higgs boson , many literatures appeared in which the higgs boson search data are explained based on the various scenarios in the thdm  @xcite .    apart from the thdm , higgs sectors which contains scalar fields with the isospin larger than 1/2 are also important to be studied .",
    "we here call such a higgs field as an @xmath4 , and also such a higgs sector as an @xmath5 .",
    "the higgs triplet model ( htm ) is one of the simplest exotic higgs sectors in which tiny neutrino masses are generated by the type - ii seesaw mechanism  @xcite . in the htm",
    ", the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the triplet field deviates the electroweak rho parameter from unity at the tree level .",
    "the experimental value of the rho parameter is close to unity , so that the triplet vev is severely constrained .",
    "there have been several models proposed with triplet higgs fields .",
    "for instance , in the georgi - machacek ( gm ) model  @xcite , a real triplet higgs field is added to the htm in order to keep the electroweak rho parameter to be unity at the tree level by taking an alignment of two triplet vev s . in the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the lepton number violating mass in the htm is induced at the one - loop level .",
    "in addition , the supersymmetric extention of the htm has also been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as another example for exotic higgs sectors ,",
    "the higgs quadruplet field is introduced in models proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , in which neutrino masses are generated through higher dimensional operators  @xcite and via the one - loop level  @xcite .",
    "the higgs sector with the scalar quintuplet can be used to be built a two - loop radiative seesaw model  @xcite . recently , the model with the septet higgs field has also been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this talk",
    ", we focus on exotic higgs sectors . to know the @xmath6 of the higgs sector is important not only to probe exotic higgs sectors but also to know the usual higgs sector such as multi - doublet models .",
    "we first discuss the general features of the exotic higgs sectors , and then we consider several concrete models .",
    "there are several striking features in exotic higgs sectors which can be listed as as follows :    1",
    ".   the electroweak rho parameter can deviate from unity at the tree level .",
    "the @xmath7 vertex ( @xmath8 are physical singly - charged higgs bosons ) appears at the tree level .",
    "the @xmath9 vertex does not appear in any higgs sectors at the tree level because of the @xmath10 symmetry .",
    "3 .   the @xmath11 coupling ( @xmath12 is the sm - like higgs boson and @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) can be larger than the sm value .",
    "4 .   an extra global @xmath15 symmetry can accidentally exist in the higgs potential .",
    "let us first define the general higgs sector which contains @xmath16 higgs multiplets @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) with the isospin @xmath19 and the hypercharge @xmath20 to clarify the properties 1 , 2 and 3 listed in the above .",
    "the sum @xmath21 corresponds to the electromagnetic charge @xmath22 , and it should be an integer number .",
    "we assume cp conservation of the higgs sector for simplicity .",
    "the higgs multiplet @xmath17 can be expressed as @xmath23^t , \\notag\\\\ & \\text{with}~\\phi_i^0=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2c_i}}(h_i^0 + v_i+iz_i^0)~\\text{for $ y_i\\neq 0 $ field},\\quad\\phi_i^0=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2c_i}}(h_i^0 + v_i)~\\text{for $ y_i= 0 $ field } , \\label{phi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the vev of the higgs multiplet , and @xmath25 for a complex ( real ) higgs field .",
    "we note that in the higgs field with @xmath26 , the charge conjugation of the singly - charged component field @xmath27 does not correspond to @xmath28 .",
    "the kinetic term in the general higgs sector is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the @xmath31 laddar operator , and @xmath32 is the third component of the isospin operator .",
    "the weak mixing angle @xmath33 is introduced via @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    *",
    "the electroweak rho parameter *    from eq .",
    "( [ cov ] ) , the @xmath36 and @xmath14 boson masses are calculated as @xmath37v_i^2=(246~\\text{gev})^2 . \\label{vev}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the electroweak rho parameter can then be calculated at the tree level as  @xcite @xmath38}{2\\sum_i v_i^2y_i^2}.\\label{rho}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this equation , we can find that the combination of @xmath39 satisfied with @xmath40 is @xmath41 according to the above expression , the possible combinations are ( @xmath42)=(0,0 ) , ( 1/2,1/2 ) , ( 3,2 ) , ( 25/2,15/2 ) , @xmath43 .",
    "thus , usually @xmath44 deviates from unity in exotic higgs sectors except for few special cases as written in just above .",
    "the magnitude of the deviation in @xmath44 from unity depends on the value of the vev of the exotic higgs field .",
    "the experimental value of the rho parameter is give as @xmath45  @xcite so that the vev of the exotic field is severely constrained by the data .",
    "for instance , in the higgs sector with the complex ( real ) triplet field in addition to the usual doublet field , the upper bound for the triplet vev is about 3.5 gev ( 3.8 gev ) with the 95% confidence level .",
    "there is the other way to satisfy @xmath40 even in the higgs sector contained higgs multiplets without the relation given in eq .",
    "( [ rho1 ] ) .",
    "namely , by taking some vev s of exotic higgs fields so as to keep the custodial symmetry , the rho parameter is kept to be unity at the tree level .",
    "the representative example is the gm model where the real and the complex triplet fields are added to the minimal higgs sector , and vev s of the triplet fields are taken to be aligned to keep the custodial symmetry .",
    "the @xmath7 vertex *    in order to discriminate exotic higgs sectors , we need to measure the other observables which are sensitive to the structure of the higgs sector .",
    "a common feature in the extended higgs sectors is the appearance of physical singly - charged higgs bosons @xmath8 .",
    "hence , we may be able to discriminate each higgs sector through the physics of charged higgs bosons . among the various observables related to @xmath8 ,",
    "the @xmath7 vertex is useful to test exotic higgs sectors .",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath7 vertex can be parameterized by introducing @xmath46 in the effective lagrangian @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the @xmath49-th physical singly - charged higgs bosons .",
    "the @xmath46 parameter is calculated at the tree level as  @xcite as @xmath50v_i^2y_i^2\\big\\}-\\frac{1 } { c^2_w\\rho_{\\textrm{tree}}^2 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is given in eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) .",
    "a non - zero value of @xmath52 appears at the tree level only when @xmath48 comes from an exotic higgs field . in multi - doublet models",
    ", this vertex is induced at the one loop level , so that the magnitude of the vertex tends to be smaller than that in exotic higgs sectors  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a precise measurement of the @xmath7 vertex can be used to discriminate exotic higgs sectors with @xmath40 such as the gm model .",
    "the feasibility of measuring this vertex at collider experiments has been discussed in several papers  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the single @xmath8 production from the @xmath53 fusion and the @xmath53 decay of @xmath8 have been analysed at the lhc . in the case with the mass of @xmath8 to be 200 gev and @xmath54 , @xmath55 is required to reach the signal significance to be larger than 2 at the collision energy and the integrated luminosity to be 14 tev and 600 fb@xmath56 , respectively . at the international linear collider ( ilc )",
    ", the @xmath7 vertex can be measured via the @xmath57 process  @xcite . in ref .",

    "the @xmath11 vertex *    so far , we have not observed any new particles other than the  higgs boson \" with the mass of 126 gev , so that focusing on the higgs boson couplings is quite important .",
    "first , we define the sm - like higgs boson @xmath12 whose mass is taken to be 126 gev in extended higgs sectors by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the element of the orthogonal matrix connecting @xmath62 given in eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) and the mass eigenstates for the cp - even scalar bosons .",
    "the @xmath11 couplings are then calculated by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the @xmath11 coupling in the sm , and the factor @xmath65 is expressed by @xmath66r_{ih},\\quad   c_{hzz}^i =   \\frac{2y_i^2 v_i r_{ih}}{\\sqrt{\\sum_j y_j^2 v_j^2}}. \\label{c_hvv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the general higgs sector , the charged ( neutral ) nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) can be separated from physical charged higgs bosons ( cp - odd higgs bosons ) by using the elements of the orthogonal matrices ; @xmath69 if the hypercharge of @xmath17 is @xmath70 and @xmath71 , then @xmath72 should also be included in the vector @xmath27 , and the corresponding matrix element @xmath73 should be added .    from the ng theorem , @xmath73 and @xmath74 satisfy the following relations ; @xmath75 we note that the @xmath76 factor in multi - doublet models is expressed by using eqs .",
    "( [ g_hvv ] ) and ( [ c_hvv ] ) as @xmath77 we can see that the factor is smaller than 1 because of the sum rule @xmath78 ( see eq .",
    "( [ vev ] ) ) in multi - doublet models",
    ". however , this feature @xmath79 does notnecessarily hold in exotic higgs sectors .",
    "we will see a few models with @xmath80 in the next section .",
    "* 4 . global @xmath15 symmetry *    the last feature of exotic higgs sectors listed in the begging of this section is regarded with an extra global @xmath15 symmetry .",
    "let us consider the higgs sector composed from one exotic higgs field @xmath81 in addition to the higgs doublet filed . if @xmath81 has quantum numbers of @xmath82 and @xmath26 or @xmath83 and @xmath84 , the higgs sector has an global @xmath15 symmetry associated with the phase rotation of @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "if this symmetry is spontaneously broken down due to a non - zero vev of @xmath81 , then a massless ng boson appears in addition to the usual three ng bosons @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "a model with such an additional ng boson is phenomenologically unacceptable because the ng boson can couple to the sm particles through a mixing with the cp - odd scalar component from the doublet field .",
    "there are several ways to avoid appearance of the additional ng boson .",
    "for example , this ng boson can be absorbed by the additional neutral gauge boson by extending the global symmetry to the gauge symmetry via the higgs mechanism .",
    "besides , by introducing explicit breaking terms of the @xmath15 symmetry , we can avoid such a massless scalar boson . in the latter way , if we discuss in the renormalizable theory , additional higgs fields are necessary to construct such an explicit breaking term . of course , we can introduce a higher dimensional term such like @xmath85 ( @xmath86 is the doublet higgs field ) to break the @xmath15 symmetry .",
