    "two  dimensional ( 2d ) cp@xmath0 models  @xcite play an important role in quantum field theory since they represent a convenient theoretical laboratory to investigate analytical and numerical methods to be eventually exported to qcd .",
    "this is believed to be possible since these models have several important properties in common with qcd , for instance asymptotic freedom , spontaneous mass generation , confinement and topological structure of the vacuum  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the cp@xmath0 vacuum , like the qcd one , admits instanton classical solutions . the non  trivial structure of the vacuum for the cp@xmath0 models , as well as for qcd , can be probed by defining suitable operators , like the topological charge density and its correlators , and by applying the prescriptions of quantum field theory . yet",
    "most of the observables relevant for the investigation of the vacuum topological structure of a theory are beyond the reach of perturbation theory .",
    "therefore some approximation is needed which works also in the non  perturbative regime .",
    "so far , the most effective and comprehensive tool is represented by monte carlo simulations on a space  time lattice .",
    "the lattice approach for the study of the vacuum structure brings about a very delicate task , that of separating the quantum fluctuations at the level of the lattice spacing from the relevant long  distance topological ones in any given configuration of the thermal equilibrium ensemble .",
    "indeed , trying to assign a topological charge to a thermal equilibrium configuration , treating on the same footing short  distance ( quantum ) fluctuations and long  distance ( topological ) ones , would even prevent the reaching of the continuum limit .",
    "one powerful technique , frequently adopted in the literature to study the topological structure of the vacuum , is the so ",
    "called cooling method  @xcite .",
    "the idea behind the cooling method is that the quantum fluctuations at the level of the lattice spacing of a given configuration can be smoothed out by a sequence of local minimizations of the lattice action , thus leading to a configuration where only the long  distance , topologically relevant fluctuations survive .",
    "when this procedure is performed on a set of well  decorrelated equilibrium configurations , it yields a `` cooled '' equilibrium ensemble on which the expectation values of topological quantities can be determined .",
    "the precise definition of a cooling procedure is however arbitrary to a large extent : the lattice action to be locally minimized can be chosen differently from the one used in the thermalization , the number of cooling steps is a free variable , driving or control parameters of the cooling can be introduced , and so on . comparing the behavior of different cooling methods is an interesting issue , especially when a new cooling strategy is proposed .",
    "the aim of the present work is to get insight into a new cooling method first adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite for the su(2 ) gauge theory and to compare it with two other methods , already known in the literature , namely the `` standard ''  @xcite cooling and its controlled version adopted by the pisa group ( see for instance ref .",
    "the new cooling method , as it will be pointed out in the next section , follows a different strategy with respect to the other two and could possess various interesting features , inaccessible to the other two cooling methods , like for instance preserving instanton  anti - instanton ( i  a ) pairs with interaction energy smaller than a fixable value  @xcite .",
    "the test  field for this comparison will be provided by the cp@xmath0 models , which have all the interesting topological properties of the su(@xmath12 ) gauge theories , but are much easier to simulate on a lattice .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : def ] we introduce the lattice action and the lattice discretization of the relevant topological quantities . in section  [ sec : cooling ]",
    "we describe in detail the three cooling methods . in sections  [ sec:1-inst ] and",
    "[ sec : ia ] we discuss their performance on 1instanton and i  a classical lattice configurations respectively . in section  [ sec :",
    "thermal ] we consider their behavior on thermal equilibrium configurations and find a correspondence between the three cooling techniques . in section  [ sec : topsusc ]",
    "we determine the physical value of the topological susceptibility of cp@xmath13 using the new cooling method and compare the results to those from an alternative approach not based on cooling . finally in section  [ sec : summary ]",
    "we draw our conclusions .",
    "the cp@xmath0 models describe the physics of a gauge invariant theory of interacting classical spins .",
    "the continuum action for the 2d cp@xmath0 model is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the coupling constant and @xmath16 is a @xmath17component complex scalar field which obeys the constraint @xmath18 .",
    "the bar over a complex quantity means complex conjugate and a central dot among vectors implies the scalar product : @xmath19 .",
    "we regularize the theory on a square lattice using the standard discretization : @xmath20 where @xmath21 indicates a generic site of the lattice ; @xmath22 is a u(1 ) gauge field ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 where @xmath15 is the bare lattice coupling constant .",
    "we used the standard action both to generate thermal equilibrium configurations in monte carlo simulations and during the cooling procedure .",
    "the continuum topological charge is defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the antisymmetric tensor with @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the topological charge density which can be written as the divergence of a topological current @xmath29 , @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the last integral in eq .",
    "( [ q : continuum ] ) is calculated on the 2d plane along the circle of infinite radius .",
    "the topological susceptibility @xmath31 is a renormalization group invariant quantity which gives a measure of the amount of topological excitations in the vacuum .",
    "it is defined as the two  point zero  momentum correlation of the topological charge density operator @xmath28 , @xmath32 \\ , | 0 \\rangle\\;.\\ ] ]",

    "@xmath28 is a renormalization group invariant operator .",
    "imposing that @xmath28 does not renormalize in the continuum generally implies a finite multiplicative renormalization @xmath41 on the lattice  @xcite @xmath42 @xmath43 being the lattice spacing .",
    "moreover , the lattice topological susceptibility @xmath44 in general does not meet the continuum prescription given in eq .",
    "( [ prescr ] ) , thus leading to an additive renormalization which consists in mixings of @xmath44 with operators which have the same quantum numbers as @xmath31 , @xmath45 where @xmath46 indicates such mixings .",
    "the extraction of @xmath31 from the lattice thus requires the determination of both the multiplicative and additive renormalizations , @xmath47 and @xmath46 .",
    "this is a feasible task , as will be shown in section  [ sec : topsusc ] , and in this way one obtains the so  called `` field theoretical '' determination of the topological susceptibility .",
    "alternatively one can use cooling to determine the topological susceptibility .",
    "this method will be described extensively in the next section .",
    "the idea is that , by an iterative process of local minimization of the action , the quantum fluctuations at the scale of the ultraviolet cut  off , which are responsible for the renormalizations , are suppressed thus implying @xmath48 and @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ reneq ] ) as the cooling iteration goes on , so that @xmath50 can be extracted directly from the measurement of @xmath44 after cooling , as it will be shown in section  [ sec : topsusc ] .",
    "a cooling step applied on a lattice configuration consists in assigning to every field variable a new value chosen in order to locally minimize the lattice action .",
    "the iteration of this procedure converges to a configuration which should represent a solution of the euclidean classical equations of motion . in the continuum",
    "2d cp@xmath0 models , as well as in the case of 4d su(@xmath12 ) gauge theories , there are classical solutions that belong to a definite topological charge sector , identified by an integer value of the topological charge @xmath51 and by a finite action ( @xmath52 in the case of cp@xmath0 ) . the classical solutions with @xmath53 are called instantons or anti - instantons ( depending on the sign of @xmath51 ) . on the lattice , owing to the artifacts introduced by the discretization of the theory , configurations with non  trivial topology can represent only approximated solutions of the lattice equations of motion .",
    "the common belief is that a moderately long cooling sequence can be able to wash out the quantum fluctuations of a given lattice configuration , so revealing the underlying metastable state with possible non  trivial topology , and that this state is the lattice counterpart of a continuum classical one .",
    "of course , if the cooling is further protracted , the metastable state will eventually `` decay '' into the trivial vacuum . stated in other words , once",
    "the quantum fluctuations have been eliminated and the topological bumps of a configuration ( instantons or anti - instantons ) have been revealed , if the cooling is further protracted then the isolated instantons or anti - instantons shrink , the i  a pairs annihilate and the configuration falls into the trivial vacuum of the lattice theory . in consideration of the above arguments ,",
    "it is clear that a great care is needed in determining when a cooling iteration has to be stopped .",
    "nevertheless , there is no way to prevent the loss of topological signal at lattice scales of the order of the lattice spacing , since topology at these scales can not be distinguished from quantum fluctuations .",
    "it must be pointed out however , that any loss of topological signal due to cooling which occurs at fixed scales in _ lattice units _ becomes irrelevant in _ physical units _ as far as the coupling is tuned towards its critical value , i.e. in the continuum limit , when the lattice spacing @xmath43 tends to zero .",
    "this is not the case only when the instanton size distribution is singular in the short  distance regime , as in the 2d cp@xmath54 model  @xcite .    in the case of the 2d cp@xmath0 models ,",
    "the cooling algorithm amounts to replacing at each lattice site @xmath21 the field variables @xmath16 and @xmath22 by new ones @xmath55 and @xmath56 , chosen in order to locally minimize the lattice action , while the other field variables are left unchanged . a cooling step consists in a sweep through the entire lattice volume in order to apply this local minimization sequentially at every site @xmath21 .",
    "the terms in the action density which depend on @xmath16 and @xmath22 for a given lattice site @xmath21 have the form @xmath57 and @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the respective forces .",
    "it is easy to see that the local minimum of the lattice action is obtained when the new field variables coincide with the corresponding normalized forces : @xmath61 with @xmath62 for a generic complex number or @xmath12component vector @xmath63 ( @xmath16 , @xmath59 , @xmath22 , @xmath60 , etc . ) .",
    "according to the supplementary conditions under which the above replacements are performed , we have different cooling procedures .",
    "the first cooling procedure , which we call `` standard '' , is the one where the replacements @xmath64 and @xmath65 are unconstrained .",
    "the second one , which we call `` pisa cooling '' , is the one where the replacement of @xmath16 and @xmath22 is performed if the distance between the old and the new fields is _ smaller _ than a previously fixed parameter @xmath66 : @xmath67 and analogously for the @xmath68 fields , otherwise the new field is chosen to lie on the @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) plane , at a distance from @xmath16 ( @xmath22 ) exactly equal to @xmath66  @xcite .",
    "the third cooling procedure , called `` new cooling '' in the following , was introduced in ref .",
    "it consists in making the replacement only if the distance between the old and new fields is _ larger _ than a fixed parameter @xmath71 , otherwise the field is left unchanged .",
    "we observe that the three methods follow a different strategy .",
    "in particular , while the pisa cooling acts first on the smoother fluctuations and the number of cooling iterations to be performed has to be fixed _ a priori _ , the new cooling performs local minimizations only if these fluctuations are larger than a given threshold and the iteration stops automatically when all the surviving fluctuations are smoother than the ( lattice ) threshold determined by the dimensionless parameter @xmath71 .",
    "it is easy to see that the new field variables differ from the old ones by terms which , in the continuum limit , are of order @xmath72 , where @xmath43 is the lattice spacing .",
    "therefore the parameter @xmath71 is expected to scale in the continuum limit like a quantity of dimension two .",

    "in the continuum cp@xmath0 models , in the infinite 2d space  time , a 1instanton configuration is a classical solution of the equations of motion characterized by a topological charge one and a finite action ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the explicit form of a continuum 1instanton configuration is @xmath77 with @xmath78 where @xmath63 and @xmath79 are complex @xmath12vectors which satisfy @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the space  time coordinates @xmath82 are the center of the instanton and the real parameter @xmath83 represents a measure of its size .",
    "an `` artificial '' 1instanton lattice configuration can be represented by the discretization of the above continuum configuration on a 2d finite volume lattice with periodic boundary conditions . in particular",
    ", we used the following expressions for the fields @xmath68 and @xmath84  @xcite @xmath85 @xmath86 which correspond to choose @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "actually 1instanton configurations can not exist on a 2d torus even in the continuum  @xcite and they represent only approximate solutions of the classical equations of motion .",
    "this approximation becomes better and better as the ratio @xmath89 decreases . on the lattice ,",
    "this problem would lead to metastability even in the case of an ideally perfect discretization .",
    "however the above  defined artificial 1instanton lattice configurations are enough for our purposes since they will be used only as test configurations for cooling methods and not to extract physical information .",

    "these angles are defined as @xmath94    it is clear that , while the standard cooling acts indistinctly on each lattice site , the pisa cooling and the new cooling deform 1instanton lattice configurations starting from different regions of the lattice .",
    "the new cooling will act first on the region around the center of the instanton , the pisa cooling on the border regions .",
    "therefore it is not obvious whether under the three coolings the configurations will look the same sweep after sweep .",
    "we did therefore the following check : we performed a long ( @xmath95 steps ) iteration of the standard and pisa coolings , following ref .",

    "this size was determined by a very local procedure , namely by looking for the maximum of the lattice action density @xmath98 and using the relation @xmath99 , valid for a 1instanton configuration .",
    "then , starting from the same configuration , we applied the new cooling for @xmath71 as small as @xmath100 and for each configuration obtained during the cooling iteration , we determined again @xmath90 , @xmath97 and @xmath91 .",

    "we interpret the behavior under the new cooling in the following way : as @xmath71 decreases , the cooling erases an even larger amount of quantum fluctuations thus bringing @xmath188 to a maximum . afterwards , for too small values of @xmath71 , the cooling begins to affect also the topological fluctuations and part of the topological signal gets lost .",

    "we see that there is practically no dependence on the smearing level , although error bars strongly decrease with the number of smearing levels . as for the cooling method , we see that there is a satisfying consistence among the results for the different values of @xmath71 and also between these results and those from the field theoretical method .",

    "the three cooling methods under study have been defined in section  [ sec : cooling ] .",
    "they are : the standard cooling ( a local minimization of the euclidean lattice action ) , the pisa cooling ( the same but with local minimizations constrained to be smaller than a given bound ) and a new cooling ( recently introduced in ref .",
