    "in fact , @xmath410 implies that multiplication by @xmath216 on @xmath411 is surjective .",

    "the second lie algebroid cohomology is also the space where the usual brst / bfv anomaly lives ; see @xcite for this in the context of deformation quantization .",
    "the advantage of the present approach is that one has formulae for @xmath325 , so one can in principle check whether it may be canceled .    observe that the conditions of theorem  [ t : noanomaly ] are very strong and by no means necessary . at the moment",
    "we actually do not know a single example where the anomaly shows up , at least locally .",
    "there are examples where the lie algebroid cohomology class of @xmath325 is nontrivial , see @xcite , but in these examples @xmath32 is a point , so there is no problem in quantizing its reduced space ( the problem arises however in the many - brane setting of section  [ s : mb ] ) .    as @xmath429 might be rather poor ( e.g. , just constant functions )",
    ", it might be interesting to quantize the whole lie algebroid cohomology .",
    "assuming that the @xmath1-structure is flat , by theorem  [ fawkes ] the deformed cohomology @xmath355 yields a deformation quantization of @xmath292 iff it is hausdorff , complete and @xmath216-torsion free .",

    "the crucial observation now is that @xmath444 is a nonpositively graded commutative algebra . as a consequence , @xmath445 , @xmath317 , with the differential @xmath446 .",

    "observe that the only vector field in @xmath468 is @xmath114 , so @xmath446 .",
    "the vanishing of the cohomologies in positive degrees implies that we have an @xmath1-structure on @xmath301 $ ] and a surjective map @xmath471 .",

    "however , finding a @xmath476 as above is a highly nontrivial problem , and it is not clear under which conditions a solution may exist .",
    "a very simple case is when @xmath32 consists of a point @xmath71 ( a zero of the poisson structure ) .",
    "a quantization of the inclusion map can then be reinterpreted as a character ( i.e. , an algebra morphism to the ground ring ) of the deformed algebra ( deforming the evaluation at @xmath71 ) .",
    "even in such a simple situation , the existence of a @xmath476 is guaranteed only for @xmath478 @xcite . in higher dimensions",

    "we now turn to the case when more than one coisotropic submanifold is chosen as a boundary condition .",

    "to the interval @xmath480 we associate boundary conditions corresponding to a coisotropic submanifold @xmath481 .",
    "in this section we assume that no anomalies show up .",
    "if the submanifolds are pairwise transverse this amounts to asking that for each of them the anomaly discussed in subsection  [ s : dqcs ] vanishes .",
    "the vanishing of the second lie algebroid cohomology for each submanifold is a sufficient condition by theorem  [ t : noanomaly ] .",
    "notice however that this is only a sufficient condition by no means necessary .",
    "a very simple example is when @xmath8 is symplectic and @xmath194 is lagrangian . in this case",
    "@xmath483 is a point ( assume @xmath194 to be connected ) , so there is no problem in quantizing it .",
    "the bimodule structure associated to @xmath485 can always be found ( upon choosing the star product appropriately ) . on the other hand",
    "the relevant lie algebroid cohomology is the de  rham cohomology of @xmath194 .",
    "another example is the linear case @xmath486 , where @xmath126 is a lie subalgebra of @xmath125 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that there is no anomaly in this case even if the cohomology may be very complicated .",
    "observe however that an example of nonvanishing anomaly has recently been found in @xcite .",

    "whenever a distribution is trivial , we omit underlining the submanifold . observe that @xmath458 is kontsevich s deformation quantization .",
    "with @xmath489 we then denote the @xmath490-module-@xmath491 corresponding to the picture on the left in fig .",
    "[ f : bimod ] ( where the big black dot denotes the point at infinity which has to be sent to the point in the intersection where evaluation takes place ) .",
    "the situation with three coisotropic branes @xmath194 , @xmath492 and @xmath493see the picture on the right in fig .",
    "[ f : bimod]leads to a morphism of bimodules @xmath494 in a neighborhood of a triple intersection .",
    "the construction of the corresponding kontsevich graphs has been analyzed in @xcite . in subsection",
    "[ s : fq ] we discuss a special case",
    ".    one may also consider many branes and , instead of just invariant functions , sections of the corresponding complexes of exterior algebras of normal bundles .",
    "one may hope that this would lead to @xmath1-bimodules and morphisms thereof , but problems seem to arise with four and more branes .",
    "let @xmath79 be a poisson map @xmath495 .",
    "then its graph @xmath496 is a coisotropic submanifold of @xmath497 , where @xmath498 denotes @xmath8 with opposite poisson structure .",
    "we select the two branes @xmath499 and @xmath500 in @xmath497 .",
    "consider the right @xmath501-module structure on @xmath502 , forgetting about its left @xmath503-module structure . since @xmath504 is a subalgebra of @xmath501 and kontsevich s star product has the property @xmath505",
    ", we may regard @xmath502 as an @xmath458-bimodule-@xmath506 .",
    "this bimodule has a distinguished element , the constant function @xmath96 , and the map @xmath507 , @xmath508 is an isomorphism of @xmath370$]-modules ( since it is a deformation of the pullback of the diffeomorphism @xmath509 defined by projection ) .",
    "thus , to every @xmath510 we associate a unique element @xmath511 of @xmath458 by the equation @xmath512 observe that @xmath513 is a deformation of the pullback @xmath514 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that it is a morphism of associative algebras . this way , with the assumption that there is no anomaly , we have found a quantization procedure for poisson maps .",
    "observe that one can exchange the role of @xmath194 and @xmath492 using the symmetry corresponding to reflecting the disk through the line joining the two intersections of the intervals @xmath515 and @xmath516 ( @xmath517 and @xmath518 in fig .",
    "[ f : bimod ] ) . in terms of kontsevich graphs",
    "one gets the same formulae upon changing the sign of the poisson structure ; viz . , we get the same result as before if we take @xmath519 as the ambient poisson manifold .",
    "now suppose we have two poisson maps @xmath520 and @xmath521 . with no anomalies ,",
    "we may quantize @xmath79 , @xmath350 and @xmath522 . the next problem we wish to address concerns the relation between @xmath523 and @xmath524 .    to deal with it we consider the three branes @xmath525 , @xmath526 and @xmath527 in @xmath528 as in fig.[f : bimod ] .",

    "it is possible to check that @xmath168 defines a morphism of @xmath458-bimodules-@xmath537 @xmath538 .",

    "moreover , since @xmath542 is of the form @xmath543 , it is invertible .",
    "now for @xmath544 we have the identities @xmath545 using @xmath546 and the definition of @xmath547 , we get @xmath548 where @xmath549 denotes the star product on @xmath8 .",
    "finally , @xmath550 where @xmath551 is the inverse of @xmath547 w.r.t .  @xmath549 .",
    "we now want to apply the results of the last subsection to the case of a poisson  lie group @xmath552 ; i.e. , a poisson manifold and a lie group such that the product @xmath553 and the inverse @xmath554 are poisson maps .",
    "by kontsevich we have an associative algebra @xmath555 . on the other hand ,",
    "if no anomaly is present , we get a morphism of algebras @xmath556 .",
    "the associativity equation @xmath557 then yields @xmath558 with @xmath559 . in some lucky cases",
    ", @xmath434 might turn out to be @xmath96 ( or at least central ) . in this case",
    "we would have quantized the poisson ",
    "lie group as a bialgebra .",
    "otherwise , one may hope to get the right properties for the `` associator '' @xmath434 in order to get a bialgebra out of it .",
    "finally , observe that we may also quantize the inverse and get a candidate for the antipode .",
    "if relations are preserved , we should get a hopf algebra structure on @xmath555 , i.e. , the corresponding quantum group .    just assuming that anomalies are absent is not enough to get a hopf algebra as relations are preserved only up to conjugation by certain elements .",
