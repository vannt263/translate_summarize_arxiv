    "qcd sum rule ( qcdsr ) is an important nonperturbative method in hadronic physics , introduced by shifman et al .",
    "( svz ) @xcite . due to its qcd based nature and minimally model dependent property",
    ", this semi - analytic approach has become a powerful weapon in the extensive studies on phenomenological hadronic properties .",
    "although fruitful results have been achieved within the framework of qcd sum rules , doubts on the predictive capability of this approach have never disappeared since in the original laplace / borel sum rules , the two external free parameters , i.e. , borel parameters @xmath2 and continuum thresholds @xmath3 , can not be rigorously constrained .",
    "intuitive choices of ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) can not completely exclude subjective factors in determination of the phenomenological outputs .",
    "two main directions have been developed to address the above issues .",
    "first , the sum rule stability criteria @xcite in laplace sum rules ( lsr ) , systematically developed by narison , have been widely and successfully used to study qcd phenomenological properties . in the widely used `` single narrow resonance minimal duality ansatz '' where the hadronic widths are not involved , the mass curves present stability ( if any ) in @xmath2 or @xmath3 at the extremums , where the mass depends weakly on ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) and thus optimal predictions can be achieved if validity of operator product expansion ( ope ) truncation and pole contribution dominance are simultaneously ensured . in the cases",
    "where the @xmath3-stability is absent , the finite energy sum rules ( fesr ) @xcite can complement the systematics of the method @xcite .",
    "the monte - carlo based weighted - least - squares fitting procedure is another quite successful approach to allow reliable sum rule predictions @xcite .",
    "as originally suggested by svz @xcite , the sum rules should be analyzed in a certain range of the borel parameter , called the `` sum rule window '' , in which the ope series reach convergence and the continuum contribution are suppressed . directly following this discussion , leinweber introduced the monte - carlo based weighted - least - squares fitting procedure @xcite in the sum rule numerical analysis . within this approach ,",
    "phenomenological outputs , such as the mass , the decay constant , and the continuum threshold etc .",
    ", can be obtained by minimizing the weighted-@xmath4 function between the ope and phenomenological expressions of the correlation function within the sum rule window .",
    "this method has some obvious advantages :    * the continuum threshold @xmath3 can be determined from the fitting procedure ; * different parametrization models for the hadronic spectral function can be dealt with therefore it is possible to obtain predictions both for hadronic mass and width with an appropriate spectral density ; * uncertainty analyses and dependence of the outputs on the phenomenological input parameters can be provided via the monte - carlo based numerical procedure .",
    "however , as in the original ( as well as many common uses of ) qcd sum rules , the sum rule window can not be rigorously constrained .",
    "the usual imposed conditions , the pole contribution @xmath5 50@xmath6 of total phenomenological expression and the highest dimension operator ( hdo ) contribution @xmath7 10@xmath6 of the total ope , can not always be ensured especially for multi - quark state sum rules where the ope convergence is slower , which makes artificial adjustments of these constraints inevitable .",
    "the hlder inequalities for qcd sum rules , obtained from the requirement that the imaginary part of a correlation function should be positive because of its relation to a hadronic spectral function ( e.g. , physical cross sections for electromagnetic currents ) , were first introduced as fundamental constraints on the sum rules by benmerrouche et al .",
    "@xcite , then were used in many research works on qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "however , these inequalities have mainly been applied in analyses of the simplified `` single narrow resonance minimal duality ansatz '' .",
    "in fact , most hadrons listed in review of particle physics @xcite are resonances rather than stable particles , thus the mass and width are equally important in describing the properties of these hadrons , and equal attention should be paid to them .",
    "some researchers replace the delta function in spectral density directly with a breit - wigner ( bw ) type function in order to obtain information for the hadron width in qcd sum rules @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will introduce a bw type parametrization for the phenomenological spectral function and the rigorous hlder - inequality - determined sum rule window in the monte - carlo based fitting procedure .",
    "we will reanalyze the phenomenological properties of the @xmath0 meson with this new systematic numerical procedure .",
    "a comprehensive study will be presented , including the explicit reexamination of some @xmath1 corrections in the ope where the hlder inequalities are satisfied .",
    "the previous results of these radiative corrections obtained using a projector method in @xcite were not used in the existing numerical analyses @xcite , motivating our independent calculation . ] and uncertainty analysis for the fitting results .",
    "we will conclude the paper by summarizing our calculation and analysis and discussing the possible extension of our approach .",
    "the starting point of qcd sum rules is to calculate the correlation function for a specific current . in this paper",
    ", we consider the light vector current with isospin 1 , i.e. , @xmath9 ( and @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , which has the same quantum numbers as the @xmath0 meson . because of conservation of the vector current",
    ", the correlation function for current @xmath12 can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a lorentz scalar function which can be calculated theoretically using operator - product expansion methods @xcite . the well - confirmed and widely used qcd expression of @xmath15 , including leading - order ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) perturbative terms and lo non - perturbative terms up to dimension-6 condensates reads @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the factorization violation factor which parameterizes the deviation of the four - quark condensate from a product of two - quark condensates .",
    "in addition to these terms , some researchers have also calculated the nlo corrections in @xmath1 to dimension-4 condensates @xcite , which however are not included in the existing sum rule numerical analyses for @xmath0 meson @xcite .",
    "although the results in @xcite suggest these corrections are relatively small , they can play an important role in determining the sum rule window from the hlder inequalities , motivating our independent calculation with a different method .",
    "thus , we calculate these contributions using the external field method in feynman gauge,@xmath18 ) light hybrid states . ]",
    "@xcite to examine the previous results obtained in @xcite .",
    "our results read @xmath19 which is consistent with the previous results in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the whole calculation is much more complicated than the lo calculation , thus for clarity , we give all the related feynman diagrams and explicit results of our calculation in the appendix .    in the following section , we will use @xmath20 to reanalyze the sum rules for the @xmath0 meson , and discuss the effects of these @xmath1 corrections .",
    "to obtain a qcd sum rule which can be used to predict hadronic properties , we first need to borel - transform the theoretical representation of the correlation function , i.e. , @xmath21 . after some calculations , we obtain @xmath22^{1/9 }   \\tau^2 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the borel transformation operator and @xmath24 is the running coupling constant for three flavors at scale @xmath25",
    "we have considered the renormalization - group ( rg ) improvement of the sum rules @xcite and anomalous dimensions for condensates @xcite in eq .  , where @xmath26 is the renormalization scale for condensates .",
    ".   provides the theoretical representation of borel - transformed correlation function , but in order to obtain a qcd sum rule , we still need the phenomenological representation obtained by constructing a phenomenological spectral density model .",
    "if we insert a complete set of one - particle states @xmath27 into correlation function , we will reach a phenomenological spectral density with a delta function @xmath28 , which is widely used in traditional qcd sum rules . however , the ground state of light vector @xmath8 meson , i.e. , @xmath0 meson , is a resonance which is far away from a stable particle , thus it s more appropriate to insert two - particles intermediate states into the correlation function since the two - pion decay mode is the dominant decay mode for @xmath0 meson . by inserting two - pion intermediate states into eq .  ,",
    "e.g. , inserting @xmath29 for correlation function of current @xmath30 , and using the cutkosky s cutting rules @xcite , the phenomenological expression for @xmath31 can be found @xcite : @xmath32^{3/2}|f_\\pi(s)|^2+\\textrm{contribution from excited states},\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the mass of pion , and @xmath34 has been used , where @xmath35 is the electromagnetic form factor which is normalized as @xmath36 . furthermore , since the main contribution to @xmath35 comes from the @xmath0 meson , @xmath35 should have a pole at @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the mass and width of @xmath0 meson respectively .    following ref .",
    "@xcite we use a breit - wigner form function to construct a model for the form factor as follows @xmath40 which meets the above requirement , and is more simple than the gounaris - sakurai parameterized form factor used in ref .",
    "@xcite and the parameterized form factor used in ref .",
    "@xcite . for contribution from excited states ( esc ) in the spectral density",
    ", we still use the same model as traditional qcd sum rules , i.e. , we use a spectral density as follows in this paper : @xmath41 where @xmath3 is the continuum threshold separating the contributions from excited states , and we have omitted the small mass of the pion .    by using the dispersion relation , we can obtain the phenomenological representation for borel - transformed correlation function , which has a following form : @xmath42 then the master equation for qcd sum rule can be obtained by demanding the equivalence between eq .   and :",
    "@xmath43 which can be used to obtain the predictions for @xmath3 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    obviously , because of the truncation of ope and the simplicity of the phenomenological spectral density , eq",
    ".   can not be valid for all @xmath2 , thus one requires a sum rule window in which the validity of the master equation can be established .",
    "usually , a sum rule window is determined by demanding the highest dimension operator contributions be limited to 10% of total ope contributions and the continuum contributions be limited to 50% of total phenomenological contributions @xcite . however , the setting of percentage 10% and 50% is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "benmerrouche et al .",
    "presented a method based on the hlder inequality which provides fundamental constraints on qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "the hlder inequality for integrals defined over a measure @xmath44 @xcite is @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 . since @xmath49 is positive because of its relation to spectral functions ( and in some cases to physical cross sections ) , it can serve as the measure @xmath50 in eq .  .",
    "by placing the contribution of excited states to the ope side , we obtain @xmath51 then the hlder inequality for qcd sum rules can be written as @xcite @xmath52^\\omega   \\left[r^{\\textrm{(ope - esc)}}(\\tau_2,s_0)\\right]^{1-\\omega},\\ ] ] where @xmath53 and @xmath54 were used .",
    "the parameter @xmath55 is defined as @xmath56 , which satisfies @xmath57 . for parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 we demand @xmath60 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we will perform a local analysis on eq .   with @xmath61 .",
    "the only starting point of this inequality is that @xmath62 should be positive because of its relation to physical spectral functions ( including cross sections in the case of electromagnetic currents ) , thus eq .",
    "must be satisfied if sum rules are to consistently describe integrated physical spectral functions .",
    "the hlder inequality can be used to check if a sum rule window is reliable @xcite , or to give extra constraints on some physical quantities @xcite .",
    "it can also be used to determinate the qcd sum rule window @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will use eq .   as the only constraint on the qcd sum rule window : by choosing the maximally allowed region of the hlder inequality , we will determinate a sum rule window directly .    in order to match the two sides of master equation in the sum rule window , a weighted - least - squares method @xcite will be used in this paper . by randomly generating 200 sets of gaussian distributed phenomenological input parameters with given uncertainties at @xmath63 , where @xmath64",
    ", we can estimate the standard deviation @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "then , the phenomenological output parameters @xmath3 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be obtained by minimizing @xmath67 after obtaining @xmath68 , 2000 sets of gaussian distributed input parameters with same given uncertainties will be generated , we will minimize @xmath4 to obtain a set of phenomenological output parameters for each set and the uncertainties of @xmath3 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be estimated based on these results .",
    "in our numerical analysis , we use the central values of input parameters ( at @xmath69 ) from a recent review article of qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "these values read @xmath70 where the factor @xmath17 indicates the violation of factorization hypothesis in estimating the dimension-6 quark condensates .",
    "the size of @xmath17 have been observed in different channels to be 24 @xcite , which is the scale we will consider in our analysis .    before fitting the two sides of the master equation , we should determinate the sum rule window first . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sr1 ] and [ fig : sr2 ] , we plot the region which is allowed by the hlder inequality with @xmath71 respectively . for larger factorization violation factor @xmath17 ,",
    "the allowed region shrinks , however , the main characteristics of the allowed region , such as the existence of a lower bound on @xmath3 , and the bound on @xmath2 , will persist for any value of @xmath17 from 2 to 4 . from fig .  [ fig : sr1 ] and [ fig : sr2 ] , we find that the @xmath1 corrections to @xmath72 and @xmath73 extend the allowed region to a higher @xmath2 region and lower @xmath3 region .",
    "this extension is more obvious in the case with a small @xmath17 . thus according to the hlder inequality ,",
    "the @xmath1 corrections to dimension-4 operator condensates extend the validity of the sum rule master equation . as a comparison",
    ", we also plot the region obtained by demanding hdo / ope @xmath7 10% and esc / total @xmath7 50% with @xmath74 .",
    "however , because of the small order of magnitude , the @xmath1 corrections to dimension-4 operators seem to not have important effects in the determination of the sum rule window from 50%-10% method . whether these corrections are included or",
    "not , the allowed region does not change a lot , thus we do not plot the region for which such corrections are not considered . from fig .",
    "[ fig : srwindow ] , we also observe that the constraint on the upper bound of @xmath2 from the hlder inequality is more strict than the 10% method for @xmath3 providing that @xmath3 is not too large .",
    "however , the constraint on the lower bound of @xmath2 is looser than that from the 50% method , the largest proportion of esc can be 60%-65% of total phenomenological contributions .",
    "we can not obtain a fixed sum rule window from fig .",
    "[ fig : srwindow ] because @xmath3 is not determined at first , thus in practice , we will initially `` guess '' an @xmath3 , then we will obtain a sum rule window @xmath75 $ ] from fig .",
    "[ fig : srwindow ] , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are respectively the lower bound and upper bound of the allowed @xmath2 region with the guessed @xmath3 . after finishing the analysis by using this sum rule window",
    ", we can check our initial choice on @xmath3 with its fitted value and adjust it iteratively until it is consistent with the results of the analysis . after finishing this iterative procedure ,",
    "the sum rule window is completely determined , all outputs will be obtained self - consistently from the final sum rule window .",
