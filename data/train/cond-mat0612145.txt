    "this has been extensively investigated theoretically and has led to a detailed microscopic understanding of the physics of this material . experimentally , there are many probes which are sensitive to various aspects of the anisotropic electronic structure , although there are relatively few which can determine the most fundamental parameters accurately . for example",
    ", measurements of the resistivity can be used to estimate the average mean - free - paths @xmath1 along the two principal crystallographic directions ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , but can not provide @xmath4-resolved information .",
    "knowledge of these @xmath4-dependent parameters and how they vary with doping is important for understanding the superconducting properties of mgb@xmath0 , such as @xmath5 and the upper critical field @xmath6 . in particular ,",
    "a knowledge of how a certain dopant changes the band filling and the scattering rates on the various fermi surface sheets can help in optimizing the superconducting properties for applications .",
    "for example , in order to raise @xmath6 it is necessary to lower the mean - free - path , especially on the @xmath7 sheets of the fermi surface , which have a large superconducting gap , without depressing @xmath5 too much by mixing in states from other parts of the fermi surface where the gap is smaller .",
    "the de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) effect , is a powerful method for determining the fermi surface parameters of metals , providing information about the size and shape of the fermi surface sheets , and the scattering rates and quasiparticle effective masses on these sheets @xcite .",
    "the data are usually interpreted using lifshitz - kosevich ( lk ) theory @xcite .",
    "the main experimental constraint comes from the fact that dhva oscillations are only observable if the quasiparticles complete a significant fraction of a cyclotron orbit before being scattered . in practice ,",
    "high magnetic fields and reasonably pure samples with long mean - free - paths are needed .",
    "this limits the study of doping effects on the electronic structure , since doping is usually achieved by partial atomic substitution which inevitably increases scattering and therefore decreases @xmath1 .",
    "the amplitude of the dhva signal is reduced from its value in a perfectly clean sample by the dingle factor @xcite , @xmath8 .",
    "the damping is increased with shorter @xmath1 and increased average fermi wavevector ( @xmath9 ) of the orbit ( or equivalently as the product of the cyclotron frequency @xmath10 and the scattering time @xmath11 decreases ) .",
    "this can be offset , to some extent , by making measurements at very high magnetic fields @xmath12 , although in practice , we are still limited to dopant levels of a few atomic percent where the increase in scattering is not too severe .    in this paper",

    "[ figamp ] shows the dhva torque amplitude calculated in this way , taking account of the angle dependence of @xmath43 , @xmath68 and @xmath96 .",
    "the calculated amplitude has a series of sharp minima which resemble the single minimum seen in the experimental data .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy in the number and angular location of the minima is most likely due to a small inaccuracy of the lda calculation : a warping approximately 30",
    "t smaller than that predicted by the lda ( at @xmath97 ) would place the first minimum at the experimentally observed angle ( other minima would be shifted to angles where strong damping would prevent their observation ) .",
    "this level of error in the lda calculation is entirely plausible because the value predicted for @xmath19 is @xmath98  t too high before applying a rigid energy shift .",

    "with @xmath101 and @xmath102 . at this angle @xmath103 t , as estimated from the rest of the torque loop .",
    "the substantial irreversibility above this field is probably due to surface superconductivity .",
    "note that this is part of a minor hysteresis loop ; in large samples the torque arising from superconductivity is too large to measure over a complete loop.,width=226 ]    in strongly type ii , high @xmath6 , superconductors , quantum oscillations can often be observed in the superconducting state , i.e. , at fields where superconducting vortices penetrate the sample ( see for example , ref .",

    "fig.[fig : dhvascstate ] shows an example of torque data obtained close to @xmath6 .",
    "quantum oscillations are superimposed on the background torque due to superconductivity , which arises from the anisotropy of the coherence length and pinning @xcite . as is generally found in other materials ,",
    "the dhva frequency remains identical to that in the normal state but the oscillations suffer an additional attenuation beyond the factors accounted for in the conventional lifshitz - kosevich treatment .",
    "the survival of quantum oscillations deep into the superconducting state is surprising for several reasons : ( i ) the vortex state is characterized by an intrinsic field inhomogeneity on the scale of the london penetration depth , ( ii ) pinning of vortices leads to a vortex density gradient and thus field inhomogeneity on the scale of the sample , and ( iii ) the opening of the superconducting gap modifies the low energy quasiparticle spectrum , reducing the number of carriers available to undergo cyclotron motion . despite this , oscillations can sometimes be seen at fields as low as 0.2  @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "a great deal of theoretical work @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) has been performed to establish whether the origin of the oscillations is the same as that in the normal state , and to understand the mechanisms which attenuate the oscillations .",
    "many models attribute the attenuation to the reduction in the ( spatially averaged ) density of states at the fermi energy in the vortex state@xcite , which is related to the orbit - averaged superconducting gap . this is particularly interesting as the size and @xmath4-dependence of the additional damping",
    "might be used to determine the @xmath4-dependence of the superconducting gap .",
    "rigorous experimental tests of the various theoretical models for damping of quantum oscillations in the superconducting state have been hard to perform because such observations are generally made in exotic materials where even the normal state is not well understood : in some cases only a fraction of fermi surface is detected ( even in the normal state ) and the nature of the effective mass renormalization is unknown .",
    "our knowledge of the electronic structure and superconducting properties of mgb@xmath0 , make this an ideal material for performing such a study .",
    "a common way of isolating the additional attenuation is by dividing out other field dependent factors from the original lk expression ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "this additional damping factor , @xmath106 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rs ] for mgb@xmath0 .",
    "the results were found to be similar at all measured angles , apart from changing the field values at which the attenuation begins .",
    "the attenuation has a rather rounded onset , but is quite severe , corresponding to an order of magnitude , at 0.9  @xmath6 .",
    "the value at which attenuation becomes significant is substantially lower than the point at which the torque becomes irreversible .",
    "in fact , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : rs ] , irreversibility extends to much larger fields than is expected from the rest of the superconducting torque loop .",
    "this is most likely due to surface superconductivity @xcite , although some calculations suggest that fluctuation effects may be important in this region @xcite .",
    "the field dependence of @xmath107 was found to be independent of sweep direction , i.e. , unaffected by the irreversibility of the background torque , and was reproduced in other samples with different degrees of vortex pinning .",
    "this suggests that the signal is unaffected by inhomogeneity of the the vortex distribution due to pinning .",
    "following the arguments in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is clear that the small scale field inhomogeneity due to a homogenous vortex lattice also does not produce significant attenuation of the dhva signal in mgb@xmath0 .    in another study of this effect in mgb@xmath0 @xcite , an ac field was superimposed on the main field and modulations in torque were detected .",
    "if vortices are pinned at the sample surfaces , the ac field modulation does not penetrate the bulk of the sample and an additional damping of the observed signal results . the dc field torque method used in the work described here @xcite",
    "is not affected by this problem .",
    "the damping of the dhva signal is closely linked with the onset of superconductivity in the bulk of the sample . in the present case , additional",
    "attenuation seen in the dhva signal is attributed to the finite gap present on the @xmath14 band , which is present even in fields close to @xmath6 .",

    "<S> we review experimental measurements of the fermi surface parameters of pure and al - doped mgb@xmath0 using the de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) effect . in general , the measurements are in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions of the electronic structure , including the strength of the electron - phonon coupling on each fermi surface sheet . for the al doped samples , we are able to measure how the band structure changes with doping and again these are in excellent agreement with calculations based on the virtual crystal approximation </S>",
    "<S> . we also review work on the dhva effect in the superconducting state .    </S>",
