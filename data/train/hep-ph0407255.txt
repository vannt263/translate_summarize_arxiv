    "the pomeron structure can be determined by using the kinematic variables in diffractive dijet events . during run",
    "i , the momentum fraction of the @xmath2 carried by the pomeron was determined using the rps to measure the momentum of the leading anti - proton .",
    "the rps is a fiber detector spectrometer with a 2-m lever arm located approximately 56  m from the interaction point ( ip ) , downstream of the anti - protons ( fig .",

    "the beam polarity at the rps location was reversed with respect to that in run  i , so that the anti - proton beam travels now closer to the rps detector .",
