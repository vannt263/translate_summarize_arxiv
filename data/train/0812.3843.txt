    "in 2001 , the e791 collaboration found a very strong evidence for a light and broad scalar - isoscalar resonance in @xmath0 decays @xcite , confirming the existence of the @xmath16 ( also referred to as the @xmath17 ) .",
    "this pioneering work was soon followed by the authentication of another elusive scalar , the @xmath18 ( or @xmath19 ) , in @xmath20 @xcite . in the past",
    ", several analyses of @xmath21 scattering data already claimed the presence of the @xmath17 in the form of a pole close to threshold and with a large imaginary part @xcite .",
    "however , its manifestation in scattering is subtle and one can consider the e791 experiment as the first solid empirical evidence for this resonance .",
    "the understanding of this pole in @xmath21 scattering has improved considerably thanks to chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite and to dispersion relations , namely roy s equations @xcite ( for recent works see , for instance , @xcite ) . in 2006",
    ", the @xmath17 pole was obtained from a theoretical analysis combining these two ingredients and yielding the accurate result @xmath22 mev @xcite . furthermore , in the last few years , experimental evidences for the @xmath17 in other processes such as @xmath23 @xcite and , notably , from new analyses of @xmath0 decays @xcite have been published .",
    "thus , at present , one can safely state that the @xmath17 is the lightest resonance in the hadronic spectrum .",
    "however , in spite of all theoretical progress , a comprehensive description of the reaction @xmath0 is still to be accomplished .",
    "the reasons are twofold .",
    "firstly , the @xmath24-quark mass lies in an intermediate range of energy , between the realm of light quarks ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) and that of heavy quarks ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "although , on the one hand , decays of light mesons such as the kaon can be treated within the framework of chpt and , on the other , decays of the @xmath30 can be calculated within qcd factorization @xcite , heavy quark effective theory @xcite and soft collinear effective theory @xcite , no such rigorous framework exists for the @xmath31 . secondly , one deals with a three - body final state which renders a full treatment of mesonic final state interactions ( fsi ) most involved .    in the search of a more sound theoretical framework to treat this type of reaction , experimentalists usually fit the dalitz plot for the three - body decay with the isobar model .",
    "schematically , the model consists of a trial amplitude of the form = _ nr e^i _ nr + _ i=1^n _",
    "i , [ atrial ] where the first term in the r.h.s .",
    "corresponds to a non - resonant background and the sum runs over all the @xmath32 resonances that contribute to the decay . in eq .",
    "( [ atrial ] ) , the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 are real constants and the sub - amplitudes @xmath35 ( depending on invariant masses ) whose main ingredients are relativistic breit - wigner functions ( bw ) , represent the propagation and decay of each resonance . in the course of the analysis , e791 discovered that the usual set of @xmath21 resonances was not sufficient to yield a good fit and , therefore , the addition of a new bw was required . leaving its mass and width free to float ,",
    "an improvement of the least square function , @xmath36 , was obtained with the parameter values @xmath37 mev and @xmath38 mev .",
    "these values , however , depend strongly on the specific bw chosen to fit the dalitz plot and , in the literature , one finds various choices of bw propagators .",
    "moreover , this simple description for a very broad resonance close to a threshold , like the @xmath17 , has many deficiencies that are discussed , for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite .    on the theoretical side , a possible way of improving eq .",
    "( [ atrial ] ) consists in replacing the bw functions with expressions based on the knowledge of scattering amplitudes",
    ". this procedure respects unitarity and reveals the relation between scattering and production experiments . using a description of the @xmath1-wave two - body fsi within a unitarized chpt framework @xcite , oller has proposed , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a modified version of eq .",
    "( [ atrial ] ) .",
    "albeit successful , this model does not tackle the weak vertex of the reaction and , consequently , the constants @xmath33 and @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) remain fit parameters .    motivated by the study of cp violation , more detailed versions of eq .",
    "( 1 ) were produced in the context of three - body hadronic @xmath30 decays , in which both the weak and strong interactions are treated : @xmath39 was considered in refs .",
    "@xcite whereas @xmath40 and @xmath41 were treated in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these works ,",
    "the weak decay is evaluated with the help of the effective weak hamiltonian within qcd factorization whereas the hadronic fsi are taken into account by means of unitary @xmath42 and @xmath21 form factors constrained by scattering data and chpt .",
    "these models confront data very well and are precisely the basis of the approach we follow in the present work .",
    "our main purpose is to test the description of @xmath6 pairs in a relative @xmath1-wave state in @xmath0 .",
    "the decay amplitude for @xmath0 is constructed as follows .",
    "we assume that the three - body decay is always mediated by a resonance @xmath5 as suggested by experimental analyses @xcite .",
    "then , for the @xmath43 pairs in an @xmath1-wave state , denoted hereafter @xmath44 , we factorize the decay amplitude @xmath45 using the effective weak hamiltonian within nave factorization . afterwards , the three - body @xmath46 final state is constructed from the intermediate @xmath47 state employing the @xmath21 scalar form factors introduced in ref .",
    "this ensures that our description of fsi is unitary and includes the coupling to the @xmath48 state .",
    "the form factor is based on the experimental scattering phase shifts @xmath49 and @xmath50 previously studied in ref . @xcite . as usual",
    ", we work within the quasi two - body approximation in which interactions of the remaining @xmath51 with the @xmath52 pair are neglected .",
    "this procedure is repeated for @xmath43 in a @xmath10-wave , which is well approximated by the @xmath11 resonance .",
    "finally , two higher mass resonances , the @xmath12 and the @xmath13 , are included phenomenologically using the isobar model .",
    "our final amplitude is then fitted to the signal function employed by the e791 collaboration @xcite ; this comparison is carried out following a scheme presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the present paper completes the description briefly reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ weak ] , we discuss the effective weak hamiltonian and the weak amplitudes employed in our description for the @xmath1- and @xmath10-waves",
    ". the construction of the three - body final state is presented in section [ strong ] , results for our fits are displayed in section [ fits ] and a summary and discussions are given in section [ conclu ] .",
    "our phenomenological description of weak decays involving @xmath1- or @xmath10-wave resonances is based on the effective weak hamiltonian , @xmath53 , which is obtained by integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom of the standard model ( sm ) lagrangian .",
    "the hamiltonian is written as an operator product expansion ( ope ) and reads ^c=1 = _ i v _ c_i ( ) o_i ( ) + , where @xmath54 gev@xmath55 @xcite is the fermi decay constant , @xmath56 are products of ckm matrix elements , @xmath57 are wilson coefficients and @xmath58 local operators entering the ope .",
    "furthermore , @xmath59 is the renormalization scale which , in our case , is taken to be of order @xmath60 . the operators @xmath58 represent the local four - quark weak interaction in the effective theory while @xmath57 describe the hard or short - distance physics and are calculated perturbatively in the full theory , in this case the sm .",
    "the contributions of all particles with mass @xmath61 , such as the heavier @xmath28 and @xmath29 quarks and the @xmath62 bosons , are included in  @xmath57 .    in the present case ,",
    "we need to consider the cabibbo suppressed transition @xmath63 .",
    "consequently , the tree level matrix elements are governed by the coefficient @xmath64 which , in wolfenstein s parametrization @xcite , is of @xmath65 where @xmath66 @xcite . in principle , our amplitudes receive contributions from strong penguins as well but , using the unitarity of the ckm matrix , one sees that these are governed by @xmath67 which is of @xmath68 .",
    "thus , penguin amplitudes are strongly ckm suppressed and can safely be neglected .",
    "this suppression contrasts with the situation found in analogous @xmath30 decays where , since one explores a different sector of the ckm matrix , penguin operators give rise to sizable contributions @xcite .    taking into account only tree operators , the matrix element of @xmath53 for the decay @xmath69",
    "can be written as ^+||d^+ = _ d _",
    "i=1 ^ 2 c_i ( ) ^+|o_i|d^+ ( ) , [ hmatrixel ] where the operators @xmath70 and @xmath71 are given by o_1&= & |d _ c |u d , + o_2&= & |u c |d d .    to deal with the matrix element @xmath72 of eq .",
    "( [ hmatrixel ] ) , we assume that factorization at leading order ( in @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) holds ^+||d^+ = _ d .",
    "[ fac ] in this context , the new coefficients @xmath75 and @xmath76 which arise are expressed in terms of the wilson coefficients @xmath77 and @xmath78 and of the number of colors @xmath79 as a_1 ( ) = c_1 ( ) + c_2 ( ) , a_2 ( ) = c_2 ( ) + c_1 ( ) .",
    "we then have products of non perturbative hadronic matrix elements that assume a decomposition in terms of lorentz invariant form factors . at this point ,",
    "a remark is in order .",
    "since @xmath60 is smaller than @xmath80 by roughly a factor three , non - factorizable contributions of order @xmath73 are larger than in @xmath30 decays .",
    "hence , the factorization approximation may be less reliable for @xmath31 physics .",
    "factorization , however , was applied successfully to two - body @xmath31 decays in the seminal papers by bauer , stech and wirbel @xcite .",
    "later , it was used in the 80 s @xcite and 90 s @xcite to describe three - body hadronic @xmath31 decays and , more recently , in 2001 , dib and rosenfeld @xcite have used the factorization approximation to treat the @xmath81 decay in order to obtain , from the then novel e791 data , the @xmath82 coupling and the form factor for the transition @xmath14 . finally , the transition @xmath83 was recently studied employing the same factorization scheme @xcite .",
    "thus , in spite of the complications introduced by the @xmath24 mass scale , this approach is a reasonable starting point for a phenomenological analysis .",
    "moreover , it enables the description to benefit from the treatment of mesonic fsi developed in the context of @xmath30 decays .      from the available experimental analyses it has become clear that the @xmath21 @xmath1-wave gives the most important contribution to the decay @xmath0",
    "the @xmath17 was found to account for almost @xmath86 of the decays whereas the @xmath3 accounts only for about @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "this picture remains unchanged with the more recent analyses of focus @xcite and cleo @xcite ( see table [ tab : ffs ] for the values extracted from these papers ) .",
    "in addition , there are indications for a sizable component arising from the higher mass scalar resonances @xmath88 and @xmath89 , although the data analyses are not conclusive .",
    "the e791 analysis includes only one state , the @xmath88 , whereas the cleo collaboration claims that both are necessary to yield a good fit within the isobar model . in our model , the @xmath17 and the @xmath3",
    "enter explicitly in the amplitude while one higher mass state close to 1500 mev is accounted for as a pole in the @xmath44 form factor , discussed in section [ strong ] .",
    "the exact nature of scalar mesons , i.e. whether their wave function is dominated by @xmath90 or @xmath91 states , or even glueballs , is not yet elucidated . in the case of the @xmath17 , the situation is even more obscure , since the issue whether it is a pre - existing quark state or dynamically generated by the strong @xmath1-wave @xmath21 interactions is still under debate .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of the @xmath17 in our amplitude in far from obvious . on the other hand , we know that the @xmath17 is an isoscalar state and no indications of a strange quark component in its wave function exists .",
    "thus , we assign to the @xmath17 the minimal quark content compatible with these two facts , namely @xmath92 .",
    "concerning the quark content of the @xmath3 , it is well established that it has a non - negligeable strange component .",
    "higher fock states , e.g. @xmath91 and @xmath93 , may also be important to achieve a comprehensive description of its wave function . in the context of heavy",
    "meson decays , however , there are indications that the @xmath90 component should be dominant @xcite . here",
    ", we consider the @xmath3 as pure @xmath90 while allowing for an admixture of @xmath94 : f_0 = ( u|u + d|d ) _",
    "+ s|s _ , where @xmath95 is the mixing angle . with these definitions",
    ", we can compute the weak amplitude for @xmath96 and @xmath97 decays .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath98 where @xmath99 or @xmath100 and @xmath101 or @xmath27 vanish by @xmath102 invariance .",
    "hence , the decay amplitude has no @xmath103 contribution ( see eq .",
    "( [ fac ] ) ) .",
    "the annihilation topology is likely to be neglected since it contains form factors of light mesons evaluated at high momentum ( @xmath104 ) @xcite .",
    "the weak amplitude is then purely proportional to @xmath105 .",
    "finally , we note that , in the next section , we construct the three - body final state from the intermediate @xmath106 and @xmath107 states with the help of the @xmath21 scalar form factor , thereby properly taking into account the strong fsi in this channel .    the relevant form factor for the transition @xmath14 , denoted by @xmath108 , is defined as , q^(p)||d c|d^+(p_d ) = -i ( m_d^2 - m_^2 ) f^d_0(q^2 ) , where @xmath109 and @xmath110 . furthermore",
    ", with the usual decomposition one has ^+(p)||u",
    "d|0 = i f_p^. it is then straightforward , once factorization has been applied , to write the amplitude for @xmath111 with the help of eq .",
    "( [ fac ] ) ( d^+)= ^+||d^+ = _ d a_1(m_c ) f _ ( m_d^2 - m_^2 ) f_0^d(m^2 _ ) .",
    "[ asigma ] this expression coincides with the one found in ref .",
    "@xcite and can easily be compared with the amplitude for @xmath112 from ref .",
    "@xcite as well .",
    "however , one should note that in refs .",
    "@xcite , the normalization factor @xmath113 is not included in the @xmath17 wave function .",
    "finally , we have computed the strong penguin contributions to eq .",
    "( [ asigma ] ) and we have checked explicitly that they can be neglected due to ckm suppression .    for the decay @xmath114 we obtain the following result ( d^+ f_0 ^+)= _ d a_1(m_c ) f _ ( m_d^2 - m_f_0 ^ 2 ) f_0^df_0(m^2 _ ) [ af0 ] , where we have defined f_0^df_0(m^2 _ ) = f_0^df_0(m_^2 ) .",
    "the evaluation of the amplitude @xmath116 from eq .  ( [ fac ] ) is quite analogous to the previous ones except that the contribution of the colour suppressed tree diagram does not vanish .",
