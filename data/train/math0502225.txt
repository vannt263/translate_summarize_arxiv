    "over the past 35 years affine kac - moody lie algebras have been at the centre of a considerable amount of beautiful mathematics and theoretical physics . as of late , and",
    "perhaps influenced by some of the newest theories in physics , the need seems to have arisen for some `` higher nullity '' generalizations of affine kac - moody lie algebras .",
    "it is still too early to decide what the correct final choice for these algebras will be , but it is fair to say notwithstanding , that lie algebras graded by root systems and extended affine lie algebras ( ealas ) will play a prominent role in the process @xcite .",
    "recall that given a @xmath0-grading @xmath1 of an algebra @xmath2 over a field @xmath3 , the _ loop algebra _ of @xmath4 based on @xmath2 is the subalgebra @xmath5 of @xmath6 $ ] . using this beautiful construction",
    ", v.  kac showed that ( the derived algebra modulo its centre of ) any complex affine kac - moody lie algebras can be obtained as a loop algebra of a finite dimensional simple lie algebra @xcite .",
    "the loop construction makes it clear , among other things , that the affine algebras are objects of nullity one in a sense that can be made precise .",
    "indeed , in eala theory , where the concept of nullity is well - defined , one finds that finite dimensional simple algebras are precisely the ( tame ) ealas of nullity zero whereas affine algebras are precisely the ( tame ) ealas of nullity one @xcite .",
    "it thus seems almost inevitable to ask whether , starting from an affine kac - moody lie algebra and applying the loop construction , one obtains an extended affine lie algebra of nullity 2 .",
    "this and related questions have been investigated in some detail in @xcite . in our work on this topic , as well as in @xcite , it became clear that some advantages are to be had by thinking of loop algebras based on an affine algebra as being obtained from a finite dimensional lie algebra by applying the loop construction _",
    "twice _ ( the advantages stemming from the fact that in this case the `` bottom '' algebra , namely the finite dimensional one , is much simpler than the affine algebra ) . as the reader will have surmised by now , the study of these `` iterated loop algebras '' took on a life of its own and became the subject of the present paper .    in general ,",
    "if @xmath2 is an ( arbitrary ) algebra over @xmath3 , an _ @xmath7-step iterated loop algebra _ based on @xmath2 is an algebra that can be obtained starting from @xmath2 by a sequence of @xmath7 loop constructions , each based on the algebra obtained at the previous step ( see definition [ def : iteratedloop ] ) .",
    "far from being a mere generalization of the loop construction , iterated loop algebras seem to yield interesting mathematical objects in a natural way .",
    "even when the resulting objects are known , the new point of view can be illuminating .",
    "as an example , we see in example  [ ex : quantum ] that algebras representing elements of the brauer group of the ring @xmath8 $ ] are obtained as 2-step iterated loop algebras of @xmath9 .",
    "this information is not apparent if one thinks in terms of single loop algebras of @xmath10)$ ] .",
    "this paper contains a detailed study of the basic properties of iterated loop algebras .",
    "we begin in section [ sec : gen ] by recording some simple properties of the centroid of an algebra . in the rest of section [ sec : gen ] and in section",
    "[ sec : primepfgc ] we define and give the basic properties of a very important class of algebras which for lack of a better name we have simply referred to as pfgc algebras ( nonzero , perfect , and finitely generated as modules over their centroids ) .",
    "the property of being a prime pfgc algebra arises naturally in the study of iterated loop algebras since this property is carried over to a loop algebra ( and hence to an iterated loop algebra ) from its base .",
    "in contrast the property of finite dimensional central simplicity certainly does not carry over in the same way .",
    "after this discussion of pfgc algebras we establish in section [ sec : loop ] some basic properties of ( one step ) loop algebras .",
    "the main results of the paper appear in sections [ sec : iterated ] , [ sec : centroiditerated ] , [ sec : untwist ] and [ sec : permanence ] .",
    "these all deal with properties of an @xmath7-step iterated loop algebra @xmath11 based on a pfgc algebra @xmath2 .",
    "first theorem [ thm : basic ] establishes a long list of properties that carry over from @xmath2 to @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , it is shown ( as mentioned above ) that if @xmath2 is a prime pfgc algebra then so is @xmath11 .",
    "next theorem [ thm : centloopn ] shows that the centroid @xmath12 of @xmath11 is itself an @xmath7-step iterated loop algebra of the centroid of @xmath2 .",
    "the same theorem describes a method of calculating @xmath12 explicitly",
    ". then theorem [ thm : untwist ] shows that @xmath11 can be `` untwisted '' by a base ring extension of @xmath12 that is free of finite rank .",
    "that is , the algebra @xmath11 ( after such a base ring extension ) becomes isomorphic to the iterated loop algebra obtained using only the trivial gradings at each stage .",
    "finally , section [ sec : permanence ] deals with the concept of type of an algebra ( which is motivated by the concept of type in terms of root systems which exists in lie theory ) .",
    "the main result , theorem [ thm : permanence ] , states that type can not change under the loop construction .",
    "each of the main results in sections [ sec : centroiditerated ] , [ sec : untwist ] and [ sec : permanence ] has several corollaries that are discussed in the respective sections . to give one important example ,",
    "we show in section [ sec : permanence ] that if @xmath11 is an @xmath7-step iterated loop algebra based on a finite dimensional split simple lie algebra @xmath2 over a field of characteristic 0 then both @xmath2 and @xmath7 are isomorphism invariants of @xmath11 ( see corollary [ cor : liebase ] ) .",
    "this result will play a crucial role in our forthcoming work on the classification of the centreless cores of eala s of nullity 2 @xcite .    in the last section , section [ sec : twostep ] ,",
    "we look closely at 2-step iterated loop algebras .",
    "if the base algebra is finite dimensional and central simple , these 2-step iterated loop algebras come in two kinds , depending on the structure of their centroids .",
    "we illustrate this fact along with many of the concepts discussed in the paper by describing two examples dealing respectively with lie algebras and associative algebras .",
