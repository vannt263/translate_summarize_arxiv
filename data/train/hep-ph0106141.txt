    "at high temperatures qcd is expected to be found in a new phase , the quark - gluon plasma . while the thermal excitations are hadrons and glueballs at low @xmath0 , the degrees of freedom in the plasma phase are the quarks and gluons .",
    "this new state of matter is believed to have existed during the first microseconds after the big bang , and much of the recent interest stems from the fact such conditions may be produced in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "already the results from cern - sps seem to hint in that direction , and the experiments at higher energies at bnl - rhic have provided a wealth of new interesting results after its first year of running @xcite . to understand and interpret the experimental signatures in terms of the evolution of the initial stage after",
    "a heavy - ion collision is clearly a very challenging theoretical task .",
    "the most convincing theoretical results that a drastic change in the degrees of freedom takes place at a certain @xmath0 come from lattice studies . in the pure glue theory ,",
    "there is a phase transition between the confined and deconfined phases at a critical temperature @xmath1 mev @xcite .",
    "when massless quarks are added , there is similarly a phase transition to a chirally symmetric phase at @xmath2 mev @xcite , where the precise value depends on the number of flavors .",
    "recent lattice simulations also suggest that the chiral transition is simultaneous with the deconfining one @xcite . at physical quark masses",
    "the situation is not completely clear , in the sense that there may not be a true phase transition but only a rapid cross - over @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , lattice simulations have shown that the pressure , divided by the ideal gas result and plotted against @xmath3 , is almost independent of the number of flavors @xcite .    due to asymptotic freedom",
    ", the quark - gluon plasma behaves as an ideal gas at asymptotically high temperatures . up to corrections of the order of 20 percent",
    ", this behavior holds down to temperatures @xmath4 , even though each higher order term in a straightforward perturbative expansion gives widely different contributions in this temperature regime @xcite .",
    "instead , at @xmath5 one needs a resummed effective theory in terms of quasi particles , the htl effective action @xcite .",
    "such an effective description correctly reproduces thermodynamic quantities like the pressure , as measured by the lattice , down to approximately @xmath6 @xcite .    despite this progress , it is of course highly desirable to actually have an analytical description at @xmath7 , close to the critical temperature . since the qcd coupling constant @xmath8 at @xmath9 ( using a renormalization scale @xmath10 ) ,",
    "one is presumably forced to consider effective models that go beyond the fundamental qcd lagrangian . in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "such an effective theory was constructed in terms of the thermal wilson line @xmath11 , @xmath12 , \\label{wilsonline}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 denotes path ordering , @xmath14 is the inverse temperature and @xmath15 the time component of the gluon field , with @xmath16 the generators of the fundamental su(3 ) representation , @xmath17 .",
    "the trace of the wilson line is proportional to the polyakov loop @xmath18 , @xmath19 . in the pure yang - mills theory ,",
    "the polyakov loop is an order parameter for a global z(3 ) symmetry separating the confined and deconfined phases , with @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) above ( below ) the phase transition @xcite .",
    "when dynamical quarks are introduced , @xmath18 ceases to be an order parameter in the strict sense , but the susceptibility of @xmath18 still peaks strongly at @xmath9 @xcite .    in the effective theory @xcite , the pressure of the quark - gluon plasma at @xmath22 is completely due to the condensate of @xmath18 , and below @xmath9 , where @xmath21 , the pressure vanishes .",
    "moreover , the effective potential @xmath23 changes extremely rapidly around @xmath9 . hence ,",
    "as the system cools it may find itself trapped at the wrong value of @xmath24 . by coupling the effective field @xmath18 to hadronic degrees of freedom , e.g. the pions ,",
    "hadrons can be produced as @xmath18 evolves from @xmath20 and subsequently oscillates around @xmath21 .",
    "this scenario is somewhat reminiscent of reheating after inflation @xcite , and much attention has lately been paid to that aspect of the model @xcite",
    ". remarkably , many qualitative features observed at rhic are in accordance with the model predictions",
    ".    however , when it comes to questions related to the change of the expectation value of @xmath18 and particle production around @xmath9 , one has to take into account the variation of @xmath18 in space - time . in this paper",
    "we address the question of radiative corrections to the spatial variation , by considering the leading one - loop qcd contribution to the spatial derivatives of @xmath18 .",
    "previous work @xcite took into account only the classical kinetic term in the ( euclidean ) effective action , @xmath25 .",
    "while such an approach certainly is justified at these preliminary stages , it is important to estimate how much the radiative qcd - effects can affect @xmath26 around @xmath9 , where the qcd coupling constant becomes large . as for the parameters in the potential @xmath23",
    ", they can be fitted by comparing to qcd lattice results and so are well defined at all @xmath0 .",
    "the kinetic term , on the other hand , has to be matched to perturbatively calculated terms in qcd , and could therefore receive large radiative corrections .",
    "the magnitude of the first one - loop qcd correction can then hopefully serve as a guideline to the importance of loop effects , and indicate how reliable the above form of @xmath26 is at @xmath9 .",
    "we want to stress that the radiative corrections to be discussed come from qcd , and not from fluctuations in @xmath26 .    to study the correction to the kinetic term @xmath27",
    ", we first consider the one - loop induced quartic terms in qcd , that contain four powers of the external field @xmath28 and two powers of the external momenta .",
    "these terms contribute to the high @xmath0 , dimensionally reduced qcd effective action @xmath29 @xcite , and apart from providing a correction to @xmath29 they can also be related to the kinetic term in @xmath26 . as a byproduct we obtain some additional derivative interactions in @xmath26 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give the perturbative qcd calculation that corresponds to the leading derivative interactions in @xmath29 . in sec .",
    "iii we make the actual matching from an effective theory in terms of @xmath28 to the one in @xmath18 , and discuss the validity of the results .",
    "we end with our conclusions and an outlook .",
    "our conventions and some technical details can be found in the appendix .",
    "in the high temperature regime , long distance phenomena ( i.e. @xmath30 ) are dominated by the static sector of qcd . at high",
    "@xmath0 it therefore makes sense to use dimensional reduction and integrate out all the nonstatic modes in the theory @xcite . with only the static modes left ,",
    "the full qcd lagrangian is reduced to a three - dimensional theory . in principle",
    "the integrating - out procedure gives rise to an infinite number of interaction terms , but higher dimensional operators become more suppressed by powers of the qcd coupling constant @xmath31 and/or @xmath0 . in full qcd , the following terms in the resulting effective action @xmath29 have been calculated @xcite , @xmath32[d_i , a_0 ]   + g^2t^2\\left ( 1+\\frac{n_{\\ !",

    "such higher dimensional terms have been calculated in the pure yang - mills theory using the background field method @xcite , as well as in qed @xcite , but not in qcd with quarks . in this paper we will use a diagrammatic approach to the four - point function .",

    "as the temperature decreases and approaches @xmath9 the 3d theory becomes less reliable , but there could very well be a temperature region where the effective theory is still valid and the derivative interactions nonnegligible . since the contribution has a rather strong dependence on @xmath42 , a difference between the pure glue theory and e.g. @xmath95 qcd could perhaps be noticed .",
    "from the four - point function , we also found the lowest one - loop qcd correction to the spatial derivative term in the effective theory @xmath26 .",
    "the coefficient is independent of @xmath31 and much smaller than the classical term , the ratio between the two being of the order of @xmath136 at @xmath9 .",
    "this derivation assumes that the strange quark mass @xmath137 can be neglected even at @xmath9 , which of course is an oversimplification , given that @xmath138 .",
    "nevertheless , the influence of @xmath137 is not likely to change the fact that the correction is small even at @xmath9 .    at one - loop",
    ", there is an infinite number of terms that contribute to the coefficient of @xmath27 , to the same order in @xmath31 and @xmath0 , as the four - point function .",
    "this follows from the fact the induced two - derivative interactions , with @xmath139 external fields @xmath28 , is of the functional form @xmath140 , which corresponds to an expansion of @xmath18 to at most order @xmath141 in the term @xmath142 .",
    "some of these higher - dimensional contributions , maybe even the major parts , are already accounted for by rewriting the four - point function in @xmath29 in terms of @xmath18 , as in eq .",
    "( [ gammainls ] ) . in any case , since the four - point contribution is very small , it is reasonable to assume that the higher @xmath139-point functions give even smaller corrections . in that case , eq .",
    "( [ gammainls ] ) should give the correct order of magnitude for the total one - loop correction .    as mentioned earlier , there are also higher loop effects that contribute to the kinetic term in @xmath26 . for example , taking into account the two - loop correction to the diagrams in fig",
    ".  1 gives @xmath143 $ ] .",
    "to understand the reliability of the canonical term it is then crucial to know the magnitude of @xmath144 .",
    "surprisingly , studies of higher loop effects in the 3d effective theory @xmath29 indicate that they only give corrections of the order of 30% at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "if these conjectures can be taken over to the wilson line model , one could in fact expect the derivative term @xmath145 to change by perhaps at most a factor two , with all qcd - corrections taken into account .",
    "of course , this has to be regarded as a highly speculative suggestion at the present stage .    to complete the dynamical scenario",
    "one also needs the time dependence of @xmath18 .",
    "unfortunately , it is yet unclear how @xmath18 generalizes to a real time formulation @xcite . assuming that the form of the spatial derivatives can be extended to a lorentz invariant form , the predictions for pion production and the evolution of @xmath146 will remain almost unchanged @xcite . in particular ,",
    "if the lorentz invariant kinetic term does not change by more than a factor of two , it can easily be compensated by a difference in e.g. the expansion rate of the plasma .    finally , to obtain a decisive estimate of the qcd - effects in @xmath26",
    ", one has to establish either a unique mapping from @xmath29 to @xmath26 , or find a way to determine @xmath26 directly , perhaps numerically .",
