    "relativistic jets are observed from actively - accreting black holes on all scales , from stellar - mass black holes in low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) systems to supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies .",

    "lmxbs provide ideal laboratories to study jets and their connection to the accretion flow as they evolve through their full duty cycles on humanly - observable timescales .",
    "spending the majority of their lifetimes in a low - luminosity quiescent state , lmxbs occasionally go through a much brighter outburst phase ( the result of increased accretion onto the central compact object ) where the jet properties change significantly as the system transitions through a number of canonical x - ray states ( see @xcite for a full review of x - ray spectral states ) .    in a typical outburst , lmxbs",
    "are initially observed in the hard state ( hs ) , which is associated with persistent radio emission from a steady , partially self - absorbed , compact jet that has a flat or inverted , optically - thick radio spectrum ( @xmath7 , where @xmath8 ; @xcite ) .",
    "as the outburst progresses , the accretion rate increases and the system may transit through a number of intermediate states as it approaches the soft state . during the transition to the full soft state the jet emission transforms into discrete , bright , relativistically - moving knots with an optically - thin radio spectrum @xcite .",
    "the compact jet is quenched by at least 2.5 orders of magnitude @xcite as the jet spectral break moves to lower frequencies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and particle acceleration seemingly occurs at different locations within the jet @xcite . at the end of the outburst ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity decreases and the source transitions back to the hard state . in this reverse state transition",
    "the compact jet is gradually re - established ( first switching on in the radio band and then the infrared / optical band ; @xcite ) , indicating the potential build up of particle accelerating structures increasingly closer to the black hole .",
    "the processes that are responsible for launching the jet outflow are poorly understood .",
    "however , there exists a well - studied relationship between the radio and x - ray luminosities in hard state lmxbs , which has been observed for both individual sources ( e.g. gx 339@xmath04 ; ) and the entire sample of bh x - ray binaries ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although recent work has cast some doubt over the universality of the relation @xcite , it is generally described by two distinct power - law tracks in the radio / x - ray luminosity plane , an upper track and a lower , steeper , ` radio - quiet ' track @xcite .",
    "the track followed by a given source does not appear to be connected to any property of the object ( such as spin ; @xcite ) and there is evidence for some individual sources transitioning between the two tracks as their x - ray luminosity fades @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that this bimodal relationship may also exist in agn , supporting the theory that the mechanisms responsible for extracting energy from the accretion flow are similar across the mass scale @xcite .",
    "high resolution , very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations can reveal important information about the changing properties of the jet during an outburst .",
    "directly imaging the jet can determine the orientation of the jet axis , the bulk motion and structure of the jet , and how these change with the evolving accretion flow . while discrete ejecta have been observed in a number of systems in outburst ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "during the initial radio observations of maxij1836@xmath0194 , the system was in the hard x - ray spectral state . in this state ,",
    "the radio spectrum was very inverted ( figure  [ fig : lightcurves ] , bottom panel ) and linear polarisation was observed at levels of a few percent ( figure  [ fig : polarisation ] ) , significantly lower than the maximum expected theoretical levels for a perfectly ordered magnetic field .",
    "synchrotron theory predicts linear polarisation at levels of up to @xmath110% for optically - thick synchrotron emission and up to @xmath172% for optically - thin synchrotron emission in the presence of an ordered magnetic field .",
    "however , these levels have rarely been observed in lmxbs .",
    "for example , like maxij1836@xmath0194 , linear polarisation at levels of a few percent was observed in the hard states of v404  cyg @xcite and gx  339@xmath04 .",
    "the low polarisation implies either that the magnetic field was intrinsically disordered on large scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , possibly due to multiple polarised components ( which are polarised differently ; @xcite ) , a rotation of the polarisation angle within the jet @xcite or faraday rotation within the jet ( see @xcite for further discussion ) .",
    "as the system transitioned to the hims , the radio emission brightened , the radio spectrum flattened , and the linear polarisation remained at a few percent ( although it did increase marginally ) . during this time , the polarisation spectrum steepened slightly ( figure  [ fig : polarisation ] , second panel ) , which the evolution of _ fp _ shows is not just due to the change in the spectral index of stokes  _ i_. while our observations do not allow for a clear interpretation of this result , we speculate that this steepening may have been due to the magnetic field becoming intrinsically more ordered further along the jet ( away from the compact object ) , or less ordered closer to the compact object .",
    "the outburst then failed in the hims and the radio spectrum became more inverted as the source transitioned back to the hard state .    during the initial hard state observations of maxij1836@xmath0194 , the radio spectrum was very inverted , with a spectral index of @xmath28 ( determined from the stokes  _ i _ ) . while x - ray binaries in the hard state typically exhibit flat or slightly inverted radio spectra , where @xmath29 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the radio spectrum of maxij1836@xmath0194 then flattened ( to @xmath31 ) as the system transitioned into the hims .",
    "our results show that during the transition phases of the outburst , the radio spectrum appeared to track the x - ray hardness ( figure  [ fig : alpha_gamma ] ) .",
    "however , during the hard state decay the spectrum of the radio jet continued to evolve while the x - ray hardness remained steady . during this time , the jet spectral break was observed to change by an order of magnitude indicating that the jet properties are still changing significantly ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a flattening of the radio spectrum as the source softens has been observed in some ( but not all ) other systems .",
    "the shape of the spectrum is thought to be dependent on the geometry of the compact jet and the flow of material along the jet ( e.g. the bulk flow velocity along the jet and shocks and turbulence within the compact jet ; ) . at the beginning of its 2003 outburst , the radio spectrum of h  1743@xmath0322 showed a similar evolution to maxij1836@xmath0194 , where the inverted spectrum of the compact jet flattened as the system softened during its transition to the intermediate state @xcite .",
    "maxij1836@xmath0194 reached its softest point in the hims , following which the jet spectrum became more inverted as the system transitioned back to the hard state .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from this small sample , the difference in the evolution of the jet spectrum between systems does not appear to be related to any physical parameter of the system such as inclination angle and black hole mass . while it appears that the evolution of the radio spectrum must be driven by some property of the accretion flow ( that may also be driving x - ray hardness ) , the surrounding environment , or the magnetic field ( that may affect the jet flow and shape ) , our observations",

    "following the transition back to the hard state the x - ray hardness remained steady while the jet continued to evolve . ]",
    "interestingly , while the flux density of the target changed , the fitted size of the compact jet at 8ghz remained relatively constant ( table  [ tab : xband_fits ] ) . according to @xcite ,",
    "the distance of the radio core along the jet axis , @xmath33 , is expected to scale with the observed flux density , @xmath18 , where @xmath34 .",
    "the size of the compact jet , @xmath35 , is expected to scale linearly with the distance of the radio core from the origin @xcite .",
    "therefore , the fitted size of the compact jet should relate to the flux density of the system , where @xmath36 . in our vlba observations",
    "we therefore expect to see the jet change size by a factor of @xmath12.5 at 8ghz .",
    "however , our results show that the jet size remained steady during the outburst ( even as the jet faded significantly ) , which could be due to physical properties of the jet changing as it faded ( such as changes to the opening angle , jet confinement region etc . ) .",
    "the vla observations show that the _ rm _ remained approximately constant throughout the observations ( figure  [ fig : polarisation ] ) , where @xmath37_rm_@xmath3832  radm@xmath39 ( to 1@xmath40 ) .",
    "this result is consistent with values found by @xcite for radio sources along a similar line of sight ( where @xmath41  _ rm _  @xmath25  100  radm@xmath39 ) .",
    "faraday rotation of the linearly polarised synchrotron emission is related to the thermal electron density and magnetic field along the line of sight .",
    "therefore , the stable _ rm _ suggests that the rotation is not dominated by local material ( to the source ) .",
    "the low value of the rm suggests that faraday rotation is most likely not responsible for the low levels of observed linear polarisation .",
    "we find an agreement between the calculated evpa ( @xmath42 ; section  [ sec : results_polarisation ] ) and the observed vlbi jet axis ( @xmath43 ; section  [ sec : vlbi_axis ] ) .",
    "the total jet spectrum is composed of contributions from both the optically - thick and optically - thin regions of each of the individual synchrotron components @xcite .",
    "fractional polarisation is considerably higher in the optically - thin region of each synchrotron component than the optically - thick region ; hence , it is expected that the observed polarisation is dominated by contributions from the optically - thin region of each synchrotron component @xcite and therefore that the evpa will be aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "this implies that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the jet axis in maxij1836@xmath0194 .",
    "a perpendicular magnetic field may arise from shock compression of the magnetic field @xcite , knots or hotspots in the jet @xcite , or a helical magnetic field structure dominating the observed emission @xcite , a consequence of the rotation of the accretion disk from which the jets may be launched @xcite .",
    "a similar alignment between jet axis and evpa has also been observed in the black hole x - ray binaries gx 339@xmath04 , gro j1655 - 40 @xcite and cygnus x@xmath01 ( * ? ? ? * although this measurement is model - dependent ) .",

    "given the low inclination of this system ( between 4@xmath57 and 15@xmath57 ; @xcite ) it is plausible that variable doppler boosting affects the correlation .",
    "we now investigate this possibility .    assuming random inclination angles and highly variable boosting , @xcite tested a model to determine if variable boosting could account for the scatter of the radio / x - ray correlation for the available sample of black holes . with their model",
    ", they were able to qualitatively reproduce both the scatter of the correlation , as well as the ` radio - quiet ' lower branch but noted that the model had its limitations . here",
    ", we use a similar approach to test if the steep radio / x - ray correlation could be explained by variable relativistic beaming . while recent work has cast doubt over the universality of the two well - defined tracks for the radio / x - ray correlation @xcite",
    ", we assume that the intrinsic radio luminosity of maxij1836@xmath0194 lies on the lower canonical hard - state tracks .",
    "we then determine what boosting would be required to account for the observed radio luminosity , testing whether a variable @xmath48 can plausibly account for the steeper than usual correlation .",
    "for the system to lie on the upper track , the radio emission at low x - ray luminosities would need to be significantly deboosted ( while being boosted at higher x - ray luminosities ; figure  [ fig : lrlx_representative ] ) .",
    "deboosted radio emission has been observed in lmxbs ( e.g. xte j1752@xmath0223 ; @xcite ) but is unlikely to have affected our observations due to the low inclination angle of the system .",
    "we assume that the x - ray emission remains unbeamed ( but see @xcite ) and relate the observed beamed radio luminosity , @xmath58 , to the intrinsic radio luminosity , @xmath59 , by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the doppler factor , _ n_=2 ( for a continuously replenished jet ; @xcite ) , and @xmath32 is the spectral index of the radio emission .",
    "the doppler factor is a function of @xmath48 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the velocity of the jet emission as a fraction of the speed of light , and @xmath64 is the inclination of the system ; because @xmath65 , we are then able to calculate the lorentz factor required to shift the modelled intrinsic radio luminosity to that observed .",
    "if we assume an inclination angle of 10@xmath57 @xcite , a source distance of 10 kpc @xcite and a jet axis perpendicular to the plane of the binary , then for @xmath59 to lie on the lower track of the radio / x - ray correlation @xmath48 must change by a factor of @xmath134 during the outburst ( from @xmath661 at the lowest x - ray luminosity to @xmath6734 at the highest ; figure  [ fig : lrlx ] ) .",
    "this result is sensitive to the normalisation of the assumed intrinsic radio luminosity , therefore we have tested a range of normalisations that account for the observed scatter about the lower track .",
    "the maximum values of @xmath48 are higher than previously thought for both a compact jet ( where @xmath682 ; @xcite ) and the transient jet of grs  1915 + 105 ( where 1.6@xmath691.9 ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , due to the low inclination of maxij1836@xmath0194 , the values we estimate are not so high that beaming can be ruled out as an explanation for the steep radio / x - ray correlation .",
    "fitting @xmath48 against x - ray luminosity ( as a fraction of the eddington luminosity for a 10m@xmath70 black hole ) gives @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 100120 . with this result , the bulk lorentz factor becomes larger than @xmath11 above 0.05 percent @xmath71 . for comparison ,",
    "@xcite found @xmath48 becomes @xmath72 above 0.1 percent @xmath71 .",
    "this level of boosting would be expected to have consequences on the observed radio spectrum , which coupled with the radio spectral index may then provide some insight into physical parameters of the jet ( such as the opening angle ) . however , a full modelling analysis would be required to determine the jet parameters which is beyond the scope of this paper .    at a source distance of @xmath168 kpc ,",
    "the radio emission at low x - ray luminosities falls well below the canonical relation ( figure  [ fig : lrlx_representative ] ) and could not be explained unless it was deboosted . due to the low inclination angle of the system",
    ", we do not expect deboosting . therefore ,",
    "if we assume that the steep radio / x - ray correlation is due to a variable lorentz factor , maxij1836@xmath0194 must be at a distance greater than 8kpc .",
    "our results show that relativistic beaming can account for the observed radio / x - ray correlation in maxij1836@xmath0194 .",
    "however , similar to the results of @xcite , if we applied our boosting argument to the full sample of lmxbs we would see the correlation break down at x - ray luminosities @xmath73 percent eddington .",
    "following an outburst , black hole lmxbs generally transition back to the hard state at luminosities between 0.3 and 3  percent eddington @xcite , with a mean value of @xmath12 percent , demonstrating that x - ray luminosities of @xmath73 percent eddington are expected during the hard state decay .",
    "@xcite analysed the radio / x - ray relation of gx  339@xmath04 and v404  cyg and argued that similar lorentz factors are expected between sources .",
    "we therefore conclude that while a variable lorentz factor can explain the unusually steep radio / x - ray correlation in maxij1836@xmath0194 , it can not be universally applied to the broad sample of black hole binaries .",
    "it is possible that the steep correlation is a temporary deviation from the standard track @xcite .",
    "however , when we include data from the 2012 re - flare , we see the source appears to lie on the same steep radio / x - ray track and the steep correlation and does not immediately rejoin the standard track .",
    "this system could simply produce an intrinsically steep correlation ( @xmath12@xmath40 from the steeper track of @xcite , or 4@xmath40 from that of @xcite , but see recent results from @xcite ) , however , this index can not be explained by models of x - ray emission originating as inverse compton from a corona , or being dominated by optically - thin synchrotron emission from the compact jet .",
    "we have presented the full vla , atca and vlba monitoring of maxij1836@xmath0194 during its 2011 outburst . with our intensive radio coverage of the system",
    "we have observed the evolution of the polarised compact jet .",
    "we find that the compact jet was linearly polarised at a few percent during the early , bright phase of the outburst . at later times",
    "we were unable to place any constraint on the linear polarisation from the source .",
    "we determined the vlbi jet axis and found an alignment with the _ evpa _ ( which was calculated from the measured stokes parameters ) .",
    "this implies that the magnetic field was perpendicular to the compact jet axis , possibly due to a helical structure from the rotation of the accretion disk or compression due to internal shocks within the compact jet .",
    "if this alignment is common for all lmxbs then high resolution vlbi observations may not be required to determine the orientation of the jet .",
    "however , further studies are required to gauge whether the _ evpa _ is always aligned with the jet axis . calculating the peculiar velocity from our astrometric observations",
    ", we find that the black hole likely required an asymmetric natal kick during formation to account for its high peculiar velocity . during the decay phase of the outburst we observed an unusually steep radio / x - ray correlation where @xmath74 , much steeper than other black hole lmxb systems .",
    "we test whether the steep correlation may be due to a variable jet lorentz factor .",
    "if we assume that the correlation agrees with the radio quiet radio / x - ray correlation track , the lorentz factor needs to vary from @xmath751 at low x - ray luminosities to @xmath7634 at high x - ray luminosities to produce the observed correlation .",
    "however , this relation is unlikely to explain to the full sample of black hole lmxbs , and it is possible that we are observing a temporary deviation to the standard correlation .",
    "interestingly , data from a re - flare event in 2012 show that the source appears to once again lie on the unusually steep track followed during the 2011 outburst .",
    "if the steep radio / x - ray correlation is due only to a variable lorentz factor , our data require that the source lies at a distance greater than 8kpc .",
