    "there has been considerable recent progress in the study of gamma - ray bursts .",
    "much of this results from the detection of bursts by bepposax with good locations that have allowed the detection of counterparts at other wavelengths .",
    "this has allowed measurements of redshifts that have firmly established that these bursts are at cosmological distances .",
    "however , only a few redshifts are known , so there is still much work to be done in determining the mechanisms that produce gamma - ray bursts .",
    "investigation of time profiles and spectra can shed new light on this subject .",
    "the vast majority of gamma - ray bursts that have been observed have been observed _ only _ by batse .",
    "this data can be classified into three major types : burst locations with relatively large uncertainties , temporal characteristics , and spectral characteristics . here",
    ", we shall examine temporal characteristics of bursts , along with some spectral characteristics .",
    "the temporal structure of gamma - ray bursts exhibit very diverse morphologies , from single simple spikes to extremely complex structures .",
    "so far , the only clear division of bursts based on temporal characteristics that has been found is the bimodal distribution of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 intervals , which are measures of burst durations  @xcite . in order to characterize burst time profiles , it is useful to be able to describe them using a small number of parameters",
    ".    many burst time profiles appear to be composed of a series of discrete , often overlapping , pulses , often with a _ fast rise , exponential decay _ ( fred ) shape  @xcite .",
    "these pulses have durations ranging from a few milliseconds to several seconds .",
    "the different pulses might , for example , come from different spatial volumes in or near the burst source .",
    "therefore , it may be useful to decompose burst time profiles in terms of individual pulses , each of which rises from background to a maximum and then decays back to background levels . here ,",
    "we have analyzed gamma - ray burst time profiles by representing them in terms of a finite number of pulses , each of which is described by a small number of parameters .",
    "the batse data used for this purpose is described in section  [ sec : tts ] .",
    "the basic characteristics of the time profiles based on the above model are described in section  [ sec : results ] and some of the correlations between these characteristics are described in section  [ sec : correlate ] .",
    "( further analysis of these and other correlations and their significance are discussed in an accompanying paper , @xcite . ) finally , a brief discussion is presented in section  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "the batse time - to - spill ( tts ) burst data type records the times required to accumulate a fixed number of counts , usually 64 , in each of four energy channels  @xcite .",
    "these time intervals give fixed multiples of the reciprocals of the average count rates during the spill intervals .",
    "there has been almost no analysis done using the tts data because it is less convenient to use with standard algorithms than the batse time - tagged event ( tte ) data or the various forms of binned batse data .",
    "the tts data use the limited memory on board the cgro more efficiently than do the binned data types because at lower count rates , it stores spills less frequently , with each spill having the same constant fractional statistical error . on the other hand , the binned data types always store binned counts at the same intervals , so that at low count rates the binned counts have a large fractional statistical error .",
    "the variable time resolution of the tts data ranges from under 50  ms at low background rates to under 0.1  ms in the peaks of the brightest bursts .",
    "in contrast , the finest time resolution available for binned data is 16  ms for the medium energy resolution ( mer ) data , and then only for the first 33  seconds after the burst trigger .",
    "the tts data can store up to 16,384 spill events ( over @xmath2 counts ) for each energy channel , and this is almost always sufficient to record the complete time profiles of bright , long bursts .",
    "this is unlike the tte data , which are limited to 32,768 counts in all four energy channels combined . for short bursts ,",
    "the tte data have finer time resolution than the tts data , because it records the arrival times of individual counts with 2  @xmath3s resolution .",
    "furthermore , the tte data also contain data from before the burst trigger time .",
    "one reason why this is useful is that some of the shortest bursts are nearly over by the time burst trigger conditions have been met , so the tts and mer data are nt very useful for these bursts .",
    "figure  [ b01577 ] shows a portion of the time profile of batse trigger number 1577 ( grb 4b 920502b ) that contains a spike with duration shorter than 1  ms .",
    "the data with the finest time resolution , the time - tagged event ( tte ) data , end long before the spike occurs , so the tts data give the best representation of the spike . the binned data with the finest time resolution , the mer data with 16  ms bins , are unavailable for this burst , as are the preb and discsc data with 64  ms bins .",
    "for a poisson process , the individual event times in the tte data and the binned counts in the various binned data types follow the familiar exponential and the poisson distributions , respectively .",
    "the spill times recorded in the tts data follow the _ gamma distribution _ , which is the distribution of times needed to accumulate a fixed number of independent ( poisson ) events occurring at a given rate .",
    "the probability of observing a spill time @xmath4 is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of events per spill and @xmath7 is the rate of individual events .",
    "this probability distribution is closely related to the poisson distribution , which gives the number of events occurring within fixed time intervals for the same process of independent individual events , such as photon arrivals .",
    "we now describe the pulse model used to fit grb time profiles , and the pulse - fitting procedure .",
    "the pulse model we use is the phenomological pulse model of @xcite in this model , each pulse is described by five parameters with the functional form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the time at which the pulse attains its maximum , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the rise and decay times , respectively , @xmath12 is the pulse amplitude , and @xmath13 ( the  `` peakedness '' ) gives the sharpness or smoothness of the pulse at its peak .",
    "pulses can , and frequently do , overlap .",
    "@xcite have used the same functional form to fit averaged time profiles ( atps ) of entire bursts .",
    "we have developed an interactive pulse - fitting program that can automatically find initial background level and pulse parameters using a haar wavelet denoised time profile  @xcite , and allows the user to add or delete pulses graphically .",
    "the program then finds the parameters of the pulses and a background with a constant slope by using a maximum - likelihood fit for the gamma distribution ( equation  [ eq : gamma ] ) that the tts spill times follow  @xcite .",
    "the data that we use in this paper are the tts data for all gamma - ray bursts in the batse 3b catalog  @xcite up to trigger number 2000 , covering the period from 1991 april 21 through 1992 october 22 , in all channels that are available and show time variation beyond the normal poisson noise of the background .",
    "we fit each channel of each burst separately and obtained 574 fits for 211 bursts , with a total of 2465 pulses . in many cases , the data for a burst showed no activity in a particular energy channel , only the normal background counts , so there were no pulses to fit .",
    "this occurred most frequently in energy channel  4 .",
    "in other cases , the data for a burst contained telemetry gaps or were completely missing in one or more channels , making it impossible to fit those channels .",
    "this procedure is likely to introduce selection biases , which can be quantified through simulation . to determine these biases , we simulated a set of bursts with varying numbers of pulses with distributions of pulse and background parameters based on the observed distributions in actual bursts .",
    "we generated independent counts according to the simulated time profiles to create simulated tts data , which we subjected to the same pulse - fitting procedure used for the actual batse data .",
    "the detailed results of this simulation are discussed in the appendix .",
    "we will contrast the results from the actual data with those from the simulations where necessary and relevant .",
    "the time resolution of the tts data can be determined from the fitted background rates and the amplitudes of the individual pulses ( discussed later in subsection  [ sec : amp ] ) , at both the background levels and at the peaks of the pulses .",
    "table  [ tab : res ] , columns  ( a ) show the percentage of bursts in our fitted sample where the time resolution at background levels and at the peak of the highest amplitude pulse are finer than 64  ms and 16  ms , the time resolutions of the more commonly used discsc and mer data , respectively .",
    "the background rates are taken at the time of the burst trigger , and ignore the fitted constant slope of the background .",
    "the rates at the peaks of the highest amplitude pulses include the background rates at the peak times of the pulses calculated with the background slopes .",
    "however , these rates ignore overlapping pulses , so the actual time resolution will be finer since the actual count rates will be higher . note that even at background levels , the tts data always have finer time resolution than the discsc data , except in energy channel  4 where the discsc data have finer time resolution for 32% of the bursts in our sample .",
    "crrrrrr 1 & 100% & 16% & 100% & 80% & 100% & 80% + 2 & 100% &",
    "8% & 100% & 75% & 100% & 68% + 3 & 100% & 3% & 100% & 67% & 100% & 62% + 4 & 68% & 1% & 100% & 30% & 100% & 42% + all & 96% & 8% & 100% & 69% & 100% & 65% +    table  [ tab : res ] , columns  ( b ) show the percentage of individual pulses where the tts data have time resolution finer than 16  ms and 64  ms at the pulse peaks .",
    "again , the count rates include the fitted background rates at the peak times of the pulses but ignore overlapping pulses . for all individual pulses , the tts data have finer time resolution at their peaks than the discsc data .",
    "in this section we describe characteristics of pulses in individual bursts and in the sample as a whole .      the number of pulses in a fit range from 1 to 43 , with a median of 2 pulses per fit in energy channels  1 , 2 , and 4 , and a median of 3 pulses per fit in energy channel  3 .",
    "( see figure  [ npulsech ] . )",
    "the numbers of pulses per fit follows the trend of pulse amplitudes , which we shall see tend to be highest in energy channel  3 , followed in order by channels  2 , 1 , and 4 , respectively .",
    "this appears to occur because higher amplitude pulses are easier to identify above the background , and is consistent with the simulation results shown in the appendix .",
    "@xcite have used the pulse model of equation  [ eq : pulse ] to fit the time profiles of 45 bright , long bursts .",
    "they analyzed the batse preb and discsc data types , which contain four - channel discriminator data with 64  ms resolution beginning 2 seconds before the burst trigger .",
    "for their selected sample of bursts , they fitted an average of 10 pulses per burst , with no time profiles consisting of only a single pulse .",
    "this number is considerably higher than the mean number of pulses per fit for our sample of bursts , probably because their sample was selected for high peak flux and long duration , which makes it easier to resolve more pulses .      to see how attributes of pulses within a burst vary with energy , it is necessary to match pulses in different energy channels .",
    "although burst time profiles generally have similar features in different energy channels , this matching is not straightforward , since the number of pulses fitted to a burst time profile is very often different between energy channels .",
    "we have used a simple automatic algorithm for matching pulses between adjacent energy channels .",
    "this algorithm begins by taking all pulses from the channel with fewer pulses .",
    "it then takes the same number of pulses of highest amplitude from the other channel , and matches them in time order with the pulses from the channel with fewer pulses .",
    "for example , the time profiles of batse trigger number 1577 were fitted with nine pulses in energy channel  3 , and only four pulses in channel  4 .",
    "this algorithm simply matches all four pulses in channel  4 in time order with the four highest amplitude pulses in channel  3 .",
    "while this method will not always correctly match individual pulses between energy channels and will result in broad statistical distributions , it should still preserve central tendencies and yield useful statistical information .",
    "the amplitude of a pulse , parameter @xmath12 in equation  [ eq : pulse ] , is the maximum count rate within the pulse , and measures the observed intensity of the pulse , which depends on the absolute intensity of the pulse at the burst source and the distance to the burst source .",
    "the amplitudes of the fitted pulses ranged from 40 counts / second to over 500,000 counts / second .",
    "( see table  [ tab : amp ] and figure  [ amp ] . )",
    "pulses tend to have the highest amplitudes in energy channel  3 , followed in order by channels  2 , 1 , and  4 , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "the central 68% of the pulse amplitude distributions span a range of about one order of magnitude in each of the four energy channels , with a somewhat greater range in channel  3 .",
    "we will see in the appendix that the fitting procedure tends to miss pulses with low amplitudes , so that the distributions shown may be strongly affected by selection effects in the fitting procedure .",

    "the peak flux is often used as an indicator of the distance to the burst source . since pulses can overlap , the highest pulse amplitude can be less than the actual background - subtracted peak flux .",
    "the batse burst catalogs give background - subtracted peak fluxes for 64 , 256 , and 1024  ms time bins in units of photons/@xmath14/second , for which effects such as the energy acceptances of the detectors and the orientation of the spacecraft and hence the detectors relative to the source have been accounted for and removed .",
    "the batse burst catalog also lists raw peak count rates that are not background - subtracted or corrected for any of the effects described , averaged over 64 , 256 , and 1024  ms time bins in the second most brightly illuminated detector for each burst .",
    "these peak count rates are primarily useful for comparison with the batse event trigger criteria . in some bursts ,",
    "the highest pulses are considerably narrower than the shortest time bins used to measure peak flux in the batse burst catalog .",
    "for these bursts , these peak fluxes will be lower than the true peak flux , and the fitted pulse amplitudes are likely to be a better measure of the true peak flux .",
    "the distributions of the highest pulse amplitudes are shown in table  [ tab : peak_amp ] and figure  [ peak_amp ] . since batse selectively triggers on events with high peak flux , the distributions must be strongly affected by the trigger criteria .",

    "it shows that in fits with more pulses , the minimum pulse amplitude , which can be seen from the left boundary of the distribution , tends to be higher .",
    "this could result in part from intrinsic properties of the burst sources , but may also result at least in part from a selection effect : in a complex time profile with many overlapping pulses , low amplitude pulses , which have poor signal - to - noise ratios , will be more difficult to resolve , while in a less complex time profile , they will be easier to resolve .",
    "this hypothesis appears to be confirmed by the simulation results shown in the appendix .",

    "it shows strong positive correlations between pulse amplitudes and the number of pulses in the fit for all energy channels .",

    "it is given in terms of the pulse parameters and the gamma function by @xmath16 the count fluence is a measure of the observed integrated luminosity of the pulse , which depends on the total number of photons emitted by the source within the pulse and the distance to the burst source .",

    "figure  [ npvsarea ] shows the number of pulses in each fit versus the count fluences of the individual pulses .",
    "it shows that in bursts containing more pulses , the individual pulses tend to contain fewer counts .",
    "we shall see in the next section that pulses tend to be narrower in more complex bursts .",
    "this result for count fluences implies that the tendency for pulses to be narrower is stronger than the tendency for pulses to have higher amplitudes in more complex bursts .",
    "table  [ tab : npvsafw ] , columns  ( b ) show that the corresponding negative correlations between pulse count fluences and numbers of pulses per fit are statistically significant in energy channels  1 and 2 , but not in channels  3 and 4 .",
    "the fits to simulations ( figure  [ sim_npvsarea ] and table  [ tab : sim_npvsafw ] , columns  ( b ) ) do not show the same tendency , so this most likely is not caused by selection effects in the pulse - fitting procedure .",
    "timescales in gamma - ray bursts are likely to be characteristic of the physical processes that produce them . however , since some , and possibly all , bursts are produced at cosmological distances , all observed timescales will be affected by cosmological time dilation , and wo nt represent the physical timescales at the sources .",
    "the most obvious timescale that appears in the pulse decomposition of gamma - ray burst time profiles is the pulse width , or duration .",
    "we shall measure the duration , or width , of a pulse using its full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , which is given by @xmath17 the distributions of the pulse widths , which are shown in figure  [ fwhmch ] and columns  ( a ) of table  [ tab : fwhmnu ] , peak near one second in all energy channels , with no sign of the bimodality seen in total burst durations mentioned above .",

    "we can test the hypothesis that pulses tend to be narrower at higher energies by computing the probability that the observed numbers of pulses width ratios less than 1 will occur by chance if pulse width ratios less than 1 and greater than 1 are equally probable .",

    "qualitatively similar kinds of trends have been shown to be present in individual pulses  @xcite and composite pulse shapes of many bursts  @xcite .",
    "there are , however , some quantitative differences .",
    "for example , we find that there seems to be less narrowing at higher energies ; the pulse width ratios tend to be closer to 1 between energy channels  3 and 4 than for the lower energy channels ( although the statistics are poorer , as with anything involving channel  4 ) , which is the opposite of the tendency found by @xcite . we can use the kolmogorov - smirnov test to determine if the distributions of pulse width ratios are the same between adjacent energy channels .",

    "these show that pulses tend to be narrower in bursts with more pulses .",
    "this may be an intrinsic property of grbs , or it may be a selection effect arising because narrower pulses have less overlap with adjacent pulses , hence they are easier to resolve , so more pulses tend to be identified in bursts with narrower pulses .",

    ". the first kind of correlation may be present among pulses of individual bursts or among the whole population of bursts , while the second kind will not be present among pulses of individual bursts . in order to distinguish between these two kinds of effects , it is useful to examine correlations of pulse characteristics both between different bursts , and between pulses within individual bursts .    it is simplest to find correlations between characteristics of all pulses , but such correlations would combine both kinds of effects , and the statistics would be weighted in favor of bursts containing more pulses .",
    "it is also possible to select a single pulse from each burst , and find correlations between the characteristics of these pulses from burst to burst in order to look for effects arising from the distances to burst sources .",
    "however , if the correlations are taken using the single highest amplitude or highest fluence pulse from each burst , then they could still be affected by correlations of pulse characteristics within individual bursts .",
    "for example , consider a situation where amplitudes and durations of pulses within individual bursts are correlated , and where pulse amplitudes and durations follow a common distribution for all bursts .",
    "in such a case , if we select the single highest amplitude pulse from each burst , we would find a spurious correlation between highest pulse amplitude and duration between different bursts .",

    ", we describe our method and some other correlation results .",
    "one way to find correlations of pulse characteristics within individual bursts is to calculate a correlation coefficient for each burst and examine the distribution of the degrees of correlation , for example to see if the correlation coefficients were positive for a large majority of bursts .",
    "the spearman rank - order correlation coefficient is used for this purpose here . when using the spearman rank - order correlation coefficient , the coefficients for the individual bursts are often not statistically significant because the number of pulses in each burst is not large , even though the coefficents for the different bursts may be mostly positive or mostly negative .",
    "we can test the hypothesis that there is no correlation because in the absence of any correlation , we would expect an equal number of bursts with positive correlations as with negative correlations , so the probability that the observed numbers of bursts with positive and negative correlations could occur by chance if there was no correlation is given by the binomial distribution .",
    "this is the method used here .",
    "this method ignores the strengths of the individual correlations , so it is more sensitive to a weak correlation that affects large numbers of bursts than it is to a strong correlation that affects only a small number of bursts .",

    "we can investigate spectral characteristics by using the _ hardness ratios _ of individual pulses .",
