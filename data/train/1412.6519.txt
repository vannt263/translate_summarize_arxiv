    "quantum correlations @xcite are known to play a crucial role in a wide variety of physical phenomena in ultracold gas , solid state , nuclear magnetic resonance , and other systems @xcite . in the last few years",
    ", quantum coherence and quantum correlations have been claimed to be of relevance in certain biological processes @xcite .",
    "two important biological phenomena in which quantumness may play a role include avian magnetoreception , used by migratory birds for efficient navigation @xcite , and the fenna - mathews - olson ( fmo ) light - harvesting protein complex of green sulfur bacteria , responsible for photosynthesis @xcite . in the latter process , the fmo complex plays the role of the mediator to transfer excitation energy from the light - harvesting chlorosome antennae to a reaction center .",
    "recently , it was argued that the efficient transfer of energy in photosynthesis can not be explained by the classical incoherent hopping model @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "several studies show that quantum coherence is essential in excitation energy transfer in the fmo complex @xcite .",
    "specifically , the dynamics of entanglement under the influence of dissipative environments , both markovian and non - markovian , have been extensively investigated @xcite .",
    "most of the studies in this direction are restricted to bipartite quantum correlation measures ( for exceptions , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , there exist several phenomena in the domain of quantum information and many - body physics which can not signaled and explained by bipartite quantum correlation measures , while multisite quantum correlations provide an adequate description ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "also , recent experimental breakthroughs have ensured that multiparty quantum states can be created and their multiparty quantum correlations can be detected @xcite .",
    "an obstacle in the study of multipartite quantum correlations is the usual unavailability of computable multipartite measures .",
    "one avenue to overcome this difficulty is to work with the class of multipartite quantum correlation measures based on the concept of monogamy .",
    "qualitatively , monogamy of a quantum correlation measure says that among three parties sharing a quantum state , if two are highly quantum correlated , then the third party can only possess a negligible amount of quantum correlation individually with the other two .",
    "note that classical correlations do not satisfy any such monogamy condition .",
    "this qualitative concept of monogamy can and has been quantified @xcite , and leads to multiparty quantum correlation measures , referred to as monogamy scores @xcite .",
    "another strategy to understand multiparty quantum correlations is to look at the collection of the bipartite quantum correlations across different partitions of the system .",
    "this is akin to the concept of entanglement entropy and area law @xcite , where the scaling of entanglement of a part of a many - body system to the rest is used to understand the cooperative phenomena in the system .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the dynamics of monogamy - based multipartite quantum correlation measures , specifically , negativity and discord monogamy scores , as well as collections of quantum correlations in the different bipartitions .",
    "the investigations are carried out for the fully connected network @xcite as well as for the fmo complex . to understand the effects of decoherence in the energy transfer",
    ", the evolution of multiparty quantum correlations are studied through the lindblad mechanism , including dissipation and dephasing effects , with the initial states being close to the antenna .",
    "we find that the behavior of multipartite quantum correlation measures depend both on the initial state as well as the `` nodal '' observer used in the monogamy scores .",
    "the results show that in the fmo complex , the negativity monogamy score is more robust against noise than its bipartite counterpart , irrespective of the choice of the nodal observer and the initial state .",
    "recent findings show that the fmo complex is made of seven inequivalent chromophore sites and a sink @xcite .",
    "we observe a complementary behavior between the dynamics of negativity and discord monogamy scores in the presence of noisy environments , both in the fully connected network model and in the fmo complex .",
    "in particular , we find that in the fmo complex , the modulus of the discord monogamy score possesses much smaller values as compared to the quantum discord present in the constituent bipartite states  the situation is opposite in the case of negativity .",
    "the findings clearly indicate that to detect quantum correlations in the fmo complex , multipartite entanglement measures are more effective than the bipartite ones .",
    "the opposite is true for quantum discord .",
    "moreover the dynamics of quantum correlations allows us to classify the seven inequivalent sites of the fmo complex into three groups , which in turn helps us to predict the structural arrangement of the complex .",
    "interestingly , if we look at collections of the quantum correlations in different bipartitions , and investigate their behavior as they evolve in time , then their relative values indicate the route through which the energy is transformed from the antenna to the bacterial reaction center , as has been estimated in recent observations @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "in this section , we review important abstract network models for quantum transport , where the local sites undergo both local dissipation and dephasing noise , and the excitation transfer to a reaction center is designed via an irreversible coupling to a preferred trapping site @xcite .",
    "this model is a basic framework for light - harvesting complexes as they are typically constituted of multiple chromophores which irreversibly transfer excitations to the reaction center . in order to illuminate the basic phenomena clearly",
    ", it is usual to consider that the relevant complexes are composed of several distinct two - level sites . in a network of @xmath0 sites , an excitation in the site @xmath1 is described as @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the absence of an excitation and @xmath4 represents the presence of an excitation at a particular site . the site @xmath5 is also included , to be treated as a  _ sink _ \" site .",
    "a sink state @xmath6 , indicating that the exciton is trapped to the reaction center , is given as follows : @xmath7 similarly the ground state @xmath8 , that represents the loss of the exciton , is given by @xmath9 the density matrix which characterizes the quantum state of the whole network is @xmath10 the coherent exchange of excitations between sites in the network is governed by a simple hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "the dephasing and the dissipation caused by the environment are modeled using local lindblad terms .",
    "the hamiltonian for the coherent evolution of a network of @xmath0 sites is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the raising and lowering operators respectively for the site @xmath1 , and have the form @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "also , @xmath16 denotes the on - site excitation energy at @xmath1 whereas @xmath17 represents the coupling energy between the sites @xmath18 and @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that the system is affected by two distinct types of noise due to environmental effects : ( i ) dissipation of the exciton that transfers the excitation energy of site @xmath1 to the environment , and ( ii ) a dephasing interaction with the environment that destroys the phase coherence of the system .",
    "both types of noise processes can be described using a markovian master equation with local dephasing and dissipation terms by the following lindblad super - operators : @xmath19 , \\\\",

    "the fully connected network ( fcn ) model is a simple network model which helps us to understand the effects of various environmental effects on quantum transport .",
    "thus , before going over to the more complex fmo dynamics , it is helpful to study this simpler network model .",
    "the fcn is an abstract model in which all the coupling constants in the hamiltonian ( eq .",

    "i.e. , when @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are equal for all sites , an exact analytical solution of the density matrix can be found for arbitrary ( positive ) integral values of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this exact solution provides useful insights into various mechanisms that contribute to the dephasing - assisted transport as well as to the quantum correlations involved .",
    "the fmo complex is a pigment - protein complex which is believed as the main contributor to the ultra - efficient energy transfer from the light - harvesting chlorosomes to the bacterial reaction center in green sulfur bacteria .",
    "it is a trimer of three identical units , each composed of seven bacteriochlorophyll _ a _ molecules lodged in a scaffolding of protein molecules .",
    "generally , it is modeled as a connected network of _ seven _ chromophore sites corresponding to _ seven _ bacteriochlorophyll _ a _ molecules with site - dependent coupling strengths and site energies .",

    "the incoherent part of the dynamics is the same as the network model described above .",
    "work suggests that site @xmath37 and @xmath38 are closest to the chlorosome antenna and are thus most likely to be the initial state of the fmo complex in the dynamics @xcite , whereas site @xmath39 is the preferred site , which is coupled to the reaction center at site @xmath40 ( sink ) @xcite .",
    "we choose the trapping rate , as in @xcite , to be @xmath41 , corresponding to about @xmath42 .",
    "we also assume that the dissipation rates are same for all sites and have the value @xmath43 , corresponding to about @xmath44 .",
    "finally , we set the optimized dephasing rates @xmath21 to be @xmath45 , for time @xmath46 ps , as in ref .",
    "quantum correlations , in the form of entanglement @xcite and quantum discord @xcite , considered to be unique characteristics of quantum systems , are useful resources for many quantum information and computational tasks @xcite . among entanglement measures",
    ", we will mainly focus on the negativity @xcite , which is based on the peres - horodecki criterion of separability @xcite . among other things , negativity has the advantage as it is computable for arbitrary states in arbitrary bipartite dimensions .",
    "quantum discord , is an information theoretic measure of quantum correlations and is in some sense a more fine - grained detector of quantum correlations as compared to entanglement .",
    "the measures are however equivalent , though not necessarily of equal numerical value , for pure bipartite quantum states .    for a bipartite quantum state ,",
    "@xmath47 , the negativity is defined as the absolute sum of the negative eigenvalues of the partial transposed state : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the trace norm of the matrix @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the partially transposed state with partial transposition @xcite being taken with respect to party @xmath50 .",
    "the value of the negativity does not depend on which party the partial transposition is performed .",

    "it has been argued that the monogamy score can act as a measure of multiparty quantum correlation @xcite , obtained by subtracting the `` bipartite contribution '' , @xmath72 , from the total quantum correlation , @xmath73 in the partition @xmath66 . in this paper , we will be using monogamy scores for negativity and quantum discord , and , we will refer to them as `` negativity monogamy score '' and `` discord monogamy score '' , respectively .",
    "first of all , the multiparty measures are then computable either analytically or via efficient numerical procedures",
    ". moreover , negativity and quantum discord fall on different sides of the broad division in the space of bipartite quantum correlation measures into entanglement - separability measures and information - theoretic ones .",
    "the multiparty quantum correlations generated thereof will therefore lead to the identification and understanding of a breadth of features on sharability of quantum correlations in the system considered .",
    "along with using monogamy scores as multiparty quantum correlation measures , we also use collections of quantum correlations in different bipartitions for the same purpose . given an @xmath0-party quantum state @xmath74 , we consider a bipartite quantum correlation @xmath62 , as for the monogamy scores .",
    "we then consider the collection @xmath75 for all @xmath18 .",
    "the collection provides information about how the quantum correlation , @xmath62 , is shared between different single party and the rest bipartitions , and hence gives us an understanding of the multiparty quantum correlation in the entire state .",
    "this is somewhat similar to the concept of area law ( or its violation ) where entanglement of different bipartitions of the entire system is utilized to gather information about the character of a many - body system , including quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will first present our results on bipartite and multiparty quantum correlations in the fully connected network .",
    "then we apply the concept of monogamy of quantum correlations to understand the exciton transport in fmo complexes .",

    ", we have to identify a nodal observer .",
    "the different situations correspond to cases when the nodal observers are located at sites @xmath37 , @xmath83 or @xmath76 .",

    "the population transfer for the clean case can be calculated explicitly , and for large time , i.e. for @xmath92 , it is given by @xmath93 for the @xmath76-site network model , @xmath94 .",
    "so , the rest of the population remains in the network sites and contributes to the quantum correlations and monogamy scores , except for site @xmath76 , for which the bipartite quantum correlations , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , as well as the monogamy scores , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , decay to zero after sufficient time .",

    "note that initially , the sites @xmath38 and @xmath121 receive maximum fraction of the population ( fig . [",
    "fig : popul ] ) and share a maximum amount of bipartite entanglement with the other sites .",
    "it is also noted that when @xmath135 is used as the initial state , @xmath144 initially shows non - monogamous nature . for @xmath123 and @xmath117 as initial states ,",
    "@xmath145 for most of the time interval .",
    "discord monogamy scores ( @xmath129 ) remain negative almost all the time in this case . in this case too , @xmath129 decays quickly as compared to @xmath130 , while @xmath132 lasts longer as compared to @xmath131 .",
    "the above discussions on the dynamics of multipartite as well as bipartite quantum correlations ( @xmath146 and @xmath101 ) with various sites have enabled us to classify the seven sites into three distinct groups , namely group i , consisting of sites @xmath37 and @xmath83 , group ii , with sites @xmath121 and @xmath38 , and group iii , with sites @xmath39 , @xmath133 , and @xmath76 .",
    "the qualitative behaviors of the dynamics of quantum correlations ( multiparty as well as bipartite ones ) for different sites within each group are the same , reflecting the fact that different sites within the same group behave similarly in the dynamics of the fmo complex .",
    "recent studies predict that sites @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the closest ones to the chlorosome antenna @xcite and site @xmath39 is coupled to the reaction center @xcite .",
    "this fact , obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , along with our observation on the dynamics of multipartite as well as bipartite quantum correlations strongly suggest the structural arrangement of the fmo complex .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] shows the schematic structure of the fmo complex , highlighting the group classifications , based on these observations , which match with the results obtained from electron - microscopic studies @xcite .",
    "we will show that these group classifications also support the primary energy transfer pathway in the fmo complex , obtained in the next section .",
    "in the preceding section , we focused on the monogamy scores and their constituent expressions to investigate the multiparty quantum correlations in the fully - connected and fmo networks and classified the chromophore sites into three groups . in this section",
    ", we will consider collections of quantum correlations in bipartitions for the same purpose .",
    "more precisely , we consider the fmo complex and look at the time - evolution of the collections @xmath147 and @xmath148 as functions of time .",
    "we will thereby demonstrate how the dynamics of collections can detect the most probable excitation transfer pathways in the fmo complex .",
    "[ route1 ] shows the dynamics of the quantum discords in the bipartitions @xmath66 for @xmath149 when the initial excitation is at site 1 .",
    "upto @xmath150 ps , the maximum between the @xmath151 at a particular time oscillates between @xmath152 and @xmath153 , starting with @xmath152 for @xmath154 ps . from @xmath150 ps to around @xmath155 ps , @xmath153 becomes the maximum and after that @xmath156 swims up . beyond that",
    ", @xmath157 comes close to @xmath156 and both decay to zero at large time .",
    "such analysis tempted us to infer that the main energy transfer pathway in the fmo complex , when the site 1 was initially excited , is @xmath158 , i.e. , from group i to group iii ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) , which is in consistent with earlier findings @xcite .    similarly , fig . [ route2 ] shows the dynamics of collections of quantum discords in bipartition when the initial excitation is at site @xmath38 . in a similar fashion , as when the initial excitation was at site @xmath37 , the dynamics of @xmath148 , can detect the energy transfer pathway , and which in this case is @xmath159 ( i.e. , group ii to group iii ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) ) .",
    "similar results can also be found with negativity @xmath147 and the monogamy score of negativity squared @xmath160 . for the initial state @xmath109",
    ", it is found that both the routes , mentioned earlier , come into active consideration ( fig .",
    "[ route3 ] ) .",
    "we have presented an analysis of the dynamics of multipartite quantum correlations in light - harvesting complexes modelled by the fully connected and the fmo networks .",
    "several interesting features are shown to be present in the scenario of bipartite vs. multipartite correlations in both the networks .",
    "it is been found that in general , multiparty correlations are more prominent and sustain longer than the bipartite ones for entanglement , while the opposite is found to hold in the case of quantum discord .",
    "the discord monogamy score is negative most of the time irrespective of the nodal observer and the initial state indicating that the quantum state of the fmo complex is similar in behavior to the @xmath161 state @xcite .",
    "another important feature is that the multipartite monogamy score for quantum discord decays faster than that for negativity , whereas the opposite happens for the bipartite contributions therein .",
    "based on the dynamics of bipartite and multipartite correlations , we have categorized the seven chromophore sites into three distinct groups , which enabled us to predict the structural arrangement of different sites in the fmo complex .",
    "finally , we have shown that the dynamics of multipartite quantum correlations , as quantified by collections of quantum correlation in bipartition as well as monogamy scores can detect the primary energy transfer pathways in the fmo complex .",
