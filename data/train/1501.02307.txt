    "multimedia transmission is a main driver for explosive data traffic growth in wired and wireless networks . while decades of research have been conducted in designing reliable multimedia transmission over error - prone channels , multimedia multicast over lossy packet networks is still challenging due highly variable channel conditions among different users , qos constraints and multimedia devices , e.g. , smart phones , tablets , laptops .",
    "scalable video coding ( svc ) @xcite is useful as it layers the source to enable efficient progressive reconstruction at the receiver .",
    "protection against channel impairments can be achieved by using codes that provide forward error correction ( fec ) : reed - solomon @xcite , low density parity check ( ldpc ) @xcite , turbo @xcite and fountain @xcite @xcite , as well as joint source - and - channel coding ( jscc ) @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite . other approaches that exploit source scalability to provide uep use hybrid automatic repeat request or cross - layer optimization @xcite",

    "adaptation of jscc to multimedia multicast is often inefficient in that they cater to the lowest qos user .",
    "a critical aspect of robust multimedia multicast is channel - coding performance .",
    "traditional fixed - rate fec encounters the problem of channel heterogeneity as in the case of reed - solomon ( rs ) codes that are targeted for one specific loss rate @xcite .",
    "_ rateless _ fountain codes @xcite are efficient and flexible for broadcasting or multicasting over erasure channels .",
    "the rateless property enables ( 1 ) a transmitter to generate , as needed , an unlimited number of encoded symbols , and ( 2 ) a receiver to successfully recover any subset of the encoded symbols of size slightly greater than the number of information symbols . raptor codes @xcite due to their high performance and low complexity are fountain codes that have been incorporated into the third generation partnership program ( 3gpp ) multimedia broadcast / multicast services ( mbms ) standard @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "raptor codes have been extensively evaluated for mbms download delivery .",

    "applications to distributed video streaming for relay / cooperation based receiver - driven layered multicasting is found in @xcite , while @xcite and @xcite use fountain codes for distributed video caching via user cooperation . while the raptor code itself is not suited for progressive decoding , multimedia has a hierarchical source symbol priority structure necessitating unequal error protection ( uep ) , sometimes referred to as priority encoding transmission ( pet ) @xcite .",

    "rate - distortion - based optimization can be found in @xcite . rather than incorporate code performance into the optimization ,",
    "these existing optimization approaches generally employ maximum distance separable ( mds ) codes . in this paper , code performance",
    "is taken into account in the uep rateless code optimization .",
    "not surprisingly , uep rateless code design methods have recently appeared . in @xcite ,",

    "however , these previous uep rateless code design approaches @xcite @xcite may compromise performance as they alter the lt code @xcite degree distribution unless the degree distribution is jointly - optimized with uep parameters .",
    "finally , previous approaches to uep optimization for multimedia have focused almost exclusively on providing best - effort qos , i.e. , maximization of an average fidelity measure of video / image quality of end users for a given transmission rate @xcite @xcite @xcite or with rateless codes @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite . as rateless codes",
    "have no pre - determined transmission rate , qos may be achieved by transmitting enough coded symbols to meet users qos demands .",
    "in contrast , our focus is on guaranteed qos optimization , i.e. , minimizing resource usage under the constraints of heterogeneous qos guarantees .",
    "while @xcite and @xcite presented early versions of this approach , this paper provides more complete background , technical detail , a method to simplify constraints , as well as an example video multicasting application .",
    "our main contributions are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "a uep scheme is proposed that uses random interleaving of raptor coders that enables direct application of already optimized standardized raptor codes used for 3gpp mbms @xcite . when applied to multicasting to heterogenous users ,",
    "low bandwidth clients need not receive encoded symbols targeted to high bandwidth clients , which can significantly reduce receiver complexity and time to decode .",
    "2 .   the proposed design , optimized for multimedia multicast to heterogeneous users , contains qos guarantees and factors in rateless code performance . with standardized raptor codes , this guaranteed qos optimization problem is shown to be convex with a simplified solution using karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) optimality conditions .",
    "3 .   through a combination of simulation and analysis , performance of the proposed random",
    "interleaved uep rateless design is compared to other eep and uep rateless coders .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : sysmodel ] describes the system setup and proposed uep rateless code design ; section [ sec : problem formulation ] presents the problem formulations for guaranteed and best - effort qos ; section [ sec : solution ] provides the solution for guaranteed qos .",
    "section [ sec : solution ] transforms the original problem formulation for guaranteed qos into a convex optimization problem where optimal selection probabilities for interleaving are obtained in closed form for certain cases or else numerically .",
    "comparisons with recent uep rateless coding schemes are provided in section [ sec : comparison ] .",
    "a multimedia server that transmits multimedia content simultaneously to multiple users is considered , which may include streaming with strict delay requirements .",
    "multimedia content is divided into multiple coded blocks .",
    "the server first compresses each source block using a pre - defined source coder and then adds error protection to the source information using a rateless , e.g. , raptor or lt code .",
    "encoded symbols are then multicast over a wireless lossy packet network .",
    "user subscribers are classified into @xmath0 classes according to reception capability . for class @xmath1 users , reception capability @xmath2",
    "is defined as the proportion of symbols that the receiver can successfully receive compared to the number of transmitted symbols , @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , in each transmission session , the number of successfully received encoded symbols for each user in class @xmath1 is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of symbols transmitted multiplied by the total transmitted as in @xcite . ] . without loss of generality",
    ", we order the classes according to reception quality , i.e. , @xmath6 . for example",
    ", a class 1 user may represent a mobile cell phone with limited reception quality due to size and power restrictions , while a class 2 user may represent an automobile equipped with larger antenna and higher bandwidth service .",
    "reception capabilities are determined by channel quality and bandwidth between server and receiver , and no distinction is made between overhead incurred by symbol erasures and lost symbol transmission opportunities due to client bandwidth restrictions .",
    "users in different classes may also have different qos requirements , and _ outage qos guarantees _",
    "are used to enable users to recover a given portion of source data with an achieved target probability . without loss of generality , the term _ peak signal - to - noise ratio _ ( psnr ) , a common measure used for visual media quality , is used to denote qos .",
    "let @xmath7 represent the number of information symbols in a raptor - coded source block .",
    "assume the server transmits @xmath8 encoded symbols in order to meet all users qos demands , where @xmath9 is the total transmission overhead for all layers needed to combat losses of the heterogenous users in the multicast system .",
    "for scalability , the coded source block is partitioned into @xmath10 layers in decreasing order of importance : layer @xmath11 contains the most important symbols while layer @xmath10 contains the least important symbols .",
    "for example , in video or image compression terminology , layer @xmath11 might represent the base layer ( bl ) , and layer @xmath12 the first enhancement layer ( el ) .",
    "the number of source symbols in layer @xmath13 is denoted by @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "successful decoding of layer @xmath13 requires layers @xmath16 to be decodable . rather than jointly optimizing the source and channel coders , we focus on optimizing channel coding parameters for a given source coder . therefore , we assume that the values of @xmath17 are provided by a pre - determined scalable source coder .",
    "we propose a randomly interleaved uep rateless encoder structure to provide fec for multimedia multicast as shown in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .",
    "the encoder assumes that source symbols have been allocated to the @xmath10 layers prior to encoding .",
    "encoding is performed by randomly selecting layer @xmath13 with probability @xmath18 for @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "encoded output symbols are generated by the raptor encoder for layer @xmath13 with code dimension @xmath21 , degree distribution @xmath22 and precode @xmath23 .",
    "the overall encoded data stream consists of interleaved raptor - encoded symbols from the @xmath10 encoders . from the above definitions ,",
    "@xmath9 can be lower bounded by @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the code dimension of the selected layer for user class @xmath26 .",
    "the proposed rateless coded scheme uses the random interleaving to achieve uep . while probabilistic encoding has been used in ewf rateless codes in @xcite , as well as in @xcite and @xcite , an advantage of the proposed scheme in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] is that the different layers can be encoded and decoded separately .",
    "in addition , in @xcite and @xcite , degree distributions and selection probabilities need to be optimized jointly , which is a complicated task . a practical advantage of fig .",
    "[ diagram ] when applied to a multicast system for users with different bandwidth constraints , low bandwidth clients need not receive symbols generated from source layers targeting high bandwidth clients , which reduces the complexity and time - to - decode for low bw clients . it is worth noting that one may alter the ordering of the output symbols from the random interleaved uep raptor coder using scheduling algorithms while maintaining the priority of each layer .",
    "investigations along these lines have been recently proposed in @xcite and @xcite . unlike @xcite @xcite , the proposed need not specify a packetization structure ; the scheme may be applied to data packets rather than to symbols .",
    "we consider users that require playback media at a quality no lower than their own qos requirement . since the transmitter has to provide guaranteed qos for all user classes before the start of transmission of the next source block , system delay and throughput for each source block",
    "is determined by the maximum number of transmitted symbols required to satisfy the qos of each individual user class . as delay is a critical issue in multimedia multicast ,",
    "the objective is to provide different levels of qos guarantees according to users requirements while minimizing total transmission overhead @xmath9 :    * problem * @xmath27 ( guaranteed qos ) : @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 represents the psnr of the successfully recovered source data of the class @xmath1 user given @xmath8 transmitted symbols , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote target psnr threshold and outage probability , respectively , for the class @xmath1 user .",
    "the aim is to allocate coding rates across layers through optimization of the probabilities @xmath18 , @xmath33 .",
    "the source ( e.g. , video , image ) coder is assumed to be progressive , so that the reconstruction media quality is determined mainly by the symbol errors in the lowest layer encountered in the recovery process .",
    "let @xmath34 represent the psnr achieved when layers @xmath11 to @xmath13 are successfully recovered by raptor decoding , where @xmath35 . for a given source coder , if the source psnr is represented as non - decreasing function , @xmath36 , of the total number of source symbols decoded by the receiver , then @xmath37 .",
    "for each class @xmath3 , let @xmath38 be the minimum index that satisfies @xmath39 .",
    "in order to satisfy @xmath40 , users in class @xmath1 require the raptor decoder to successfully decode , at minimum , layers @xmath11 to @xmath41 . for a given uep raptor code design , let @xmath42 represent the error probability that the class @xmath1 decoder fails to decode layer @xmath13 given transmission overhead @xmath9 and reception quality @xmath2 . in the most stringent case",
    "when decoding errors across layers are independent , qos requirements of end users can be simplified to @xmath43      while the above formulation focuses on minimizing transmission overhead subject to satisfying guaranteed user qos , this subsection considers transmission overhead that is upper bounded due to delay constraints or cost . for this scenario ,",
    "given a maximum transmission overhead , @xmath44 , the service provider attempts to provide users of different classes with the best possible qos .",
    "the following best - effort qos problem extends that in @xcite by 1 ) considering both constrained and unconstrained cases , 2 ) allowing for allocating different weighting factors to different user classes as well as 3 ) possessing the previously mentioned advantages of the proposed random interleaved uep raptor codes .",
    "the expected psnr of users in class @xmath1 , which serves as a measure of the best - effort qos , can be evaluated as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the psnr achieved when layers @xmath11 to @xmath13 are successfully recovered , where @xmath47 represents the probability that a class @xmath1 user successfully recovers layers @xmath11 to @xmath13 but fails to recover layer @xmath48 .",
    "the optimization balances users of different classes with different channel qualities by assigning weighting coefficient @xmath49 for class @xmath1 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "the choice of @xmath49 depends on both the user class importance as well as the number of users in that class .",
    "the weighted average psnr over all user classes then becomes the objective function :    * problem 2 * : ( best - effort qos ) @xmath52",
    "@xmath53    where @xmath54 in problem @xmath12 , no guaranteed minimum qos is provided . for a given maximum transmission overhead ,",
    "the service provider may instead aim to provide best - effort qos to multiple user classes , but under the additional constraint of a minimum qos guarantee for each user class :    * problem 3 * : ( best - effort qos with constraints on individual classes )    @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 where @xmath47 is given by ( [ plj ] ) and @xmath58 is the minimum layer index that satisfies @xmath39 .",
    "problem 2 is a special case of problem 3 without user qos constraints .    in the next section ,",
    "we show that problem 1.0 can be transformed to an equivalent convex optimization problem when standardized raptor codes are employed . unfortunately ,",
    "while problems 2 and 3 can not be similarly transformed due to the form of the @xmath47 expressions , they can still be solved numerically by searching the @xmath59-dimensional parameter space of @xmath60 , checking the constraints ( [ p3.0-constraint ] ) and the resulting average psnr ( [ p3.0 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath61 , the numerical method is significantly simplified as only @xmath62 $ ] that gives the maximum average psnr needs to be determined .",
    "numerical results and comparisons for problems 2 and 3 are provided later .",
    "in the proposed design , existing high - performance standardized raptor codes can be directly applied , which enable low encoding / decoding complexity and overhead .",
    "details about the pre - code , degree distribution and code construction can be found in @xcite , ( annex b ) .",
    "when standardized raptor codes are employed with maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoding for code dimension greater than @xmath63 , the decoding failure probability , i.e. , failure to decode @xmath64 source symbols after @xmath65 symbols are successfully received , have been shown , through extensive experimentation , to be accurately modeled by @xcite , @xmath66 where constants @xmath67 , @xmath68 . for @xmath69 , eq . ( [ failure prob ] ) underestimates the error probability due to short block length .",
    "one way to improve code performance for layers with fewer symbols is to merge source layers with similar optimized selection probabilities @xmath70 into larger layers .",
    "however , for video the condition @xmath71 is unlikely to occur .",
    "we also remark that standardized raptor codes outperform the recently proposed sw - raptor codes @xcite .",
    "for example , according to fig .",
    "2(b ) of @xcite , the sw - raptor codes have a decoding failure probability of almost @xmath72 with code dimension @xmath73 and overhead @xmath74 while standardized raptor codes have negligible decoding failure probability at the same code dimension and lower overhead @xmath75 according to ( [ failure prob ] ) .",
    "when more general lt or raptor codes using iterative decoding are employed , the decoding failure probability @xmath42 can be approximated by assuming that symbol errors in iterative decoding are mutually independent @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the symbol error probability of a class @xmath1 user decoding layer @xmath13 ( also see ( 3 ) of @xcite ) which can be analytically determined by _ and - or _ tree analysis @xcite . since each layer",
    "is encoded by a separate rateless code , evaluating the symbol error probability of each layer can be consider as a special case of ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) in @xcite where uniform selection is used ( @xmath78 in @xcite ) , and eq .",
