    "late time cosmic acceleration at the present epoch has almost been a de facto phenomenon since the late nineteens .",
    "advances in cosmological observations during the past two decades reveal strong evidences in favour of this accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "these evidences have been brought forth _  la _ independent astrophysical observations like supernovae type ia ( sne ia ) luminosity distance modulus as a function of redshift @xcite , observational hubble data ( ohd ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) shift parameter @xcite and baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) data @xcite .",
    "a good deal of attempts have been taken to explain this accelerated expansion assuming the presence of some exotic fluid , namely _ dark energy _ , in huge abundances in the universe . though there exists a lot of dark energy models",
    "( see for example @xcite and references therein ) with standard as well as exotic ideas ; the canonical and non - canonical scalar fields are the most promising candidates till date .",
    "of late , robert r. caldwell and eric v. linder @xcite categorized these scalar field models in two broad classes namely  freezing \" and  thawing \" dark energy , based on the asymptotic behavior of the scalar field potential . in thawing models ,",
    "dark energy equation of state @xmath0 initially remains at @xmath11 and deviates from @xmath11 near present epoch whereas just the opposite behavior of @xmath0 is witnessed in freezing models .",
    "thawing models , in which we are interested in the present article , are broadly classified into two categories : ( i ) quintessence ( for which @xmath0 moves to @xmath12 ) , and ( ii ) phantom ( where @xmath0 is less than @xmath11 )",
    ". a third possibility has also been explored in which lead to both quintessence and phantom behavior of @xmath0 . in these slow - rolling scalar field models with nearly flat potential , initially the kinetic energy of the field is much smaller than the potential energy .",
    "this is because of the initial large hubble damping which keeps the field nearly frozen at @xmath13 at earlier era i.e. , in radiation and matter dominated eras . due to the expansion of the universe , energy density of the universe decreases .",
    "after the radiation and matter dominated eras , the field energy density becomes comparable to the background energy density of the universe resulting in the deviation of the field from its frozen state , thereby leading to deviation of @xmath0 from @xmath11 .",
    "slow - roll scalar field thawing models can be characterized by different relations between @xmath0 and the scale factor @xmath14 of the universe .",
    "some typical examples of cpl parametrization ( eq .",
    "( [ cpl ] ) ) @xcite , pngb models ( eq .",
    "( [ pngb ] ) ) and algebraic thawing models ( eq . ( [ algethaw ] ) ) are included in the work by e. v. linder @xcite .",
    "the corresponding equation of state parameterizations are respectively given by , @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a parameter which is inversely proportional to the symmetry breaking energy scale and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are two free parameters .",
    "in the present work , we propose a two parameter generalization for this thawing dark energy models as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an arbitrary function of scale factor @xmath14 . in this article , we have chosen @xmath22 as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are two arbitrary parameters . in this context",
    "we would like to mention that choice of @xmath22 can be made otherwise and it would be interesting to see if there exists any observational constrain on the form of @xmath22 which is beyond the scope of this article . with the chosen form of @xmath23 for @xmath26 and",
    "@xmath27 our proposal exactly overlaps with cpl thawing dark energy model @xcite . for @xmath26 and @xmath28 , our proposal leads to pngb thawing dark energy model @xcite which have been studied exclusively for scalar fields dark energy with pngb potential @xcite .",
    "for suitable choice of the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath24 , our model can approximately reflect algebraic thawing @xcite as well .",
    "as it turns out , all the existing ( and probably , upcoming ) thawing dark energy models fall in this broad minimal parametrization with different values of the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath24 .",
    "so , rather than proposing individual models , it is quite reasonable to construct a minimal generic form of parametrization , analyze it and search for possible constraints on the parameters from present - day observations .",
    "this is the primary objective of the present article .",
    "along with this view , we also draw some comparisons among the results obtained for different values of @xmath25 ( i.e. , for @xmath26 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) with different fixed values of @xmath24 and vice - versa .",
    "we further provide justification for this proposed generalized form of thawing dark energy model against the other existing thawing models by comparing them with ours .",
    "moreover , we constrain our model by latest supernova type ia data from union2.1 compilation @xcite , newly released observational hubble parameter data @xcite , cosmic microwave background shift parameter data from wmap 9 year results @xcite and the latest baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) data from sdss - iii data release @xcite . for such analyses we have five parameters in total namely @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath31 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are matter density at present epoch normalized to critical density and hubble parameter at present epoch respectively ) . since the value of @xmath32 ( the normalized radiation density at present epoch ) is very low we do not treat it as a parameter and consider @xmath33 @xcite for numericals .",
    "our analysis also helps in comparing the standard diagnostics with model independent ones , and reveals the pros and cons of each one .",
    "the major conclusions of the paper are as follows :    * existing thawing dark energy models @xcite can be generalized in the form of eq .",
    "( [ ourmodel ] ) as we have presented in this article .",
    "our minimal generalization of thawing dark energy models ( eq .",
    "( [ ourmodel ] ) ) with two parameters @xmath25 and @xmath24 leads to different existing thawing models namely cpl ( @xmath34 ) , pngb ( @xmath35 ) and the algebraic thawing ( suitable choices of @xmath36 ) .",
    "* results obtained for different @xmath25 values ( with different values of @xmath24 ) barely differ from the observational point of view . other way around , we can say that values of @xmath25 ( with different values of @xmath24 ) can hardly affect the best fit values as well as the @xmath37 c.l.s of matter density parameter @xmath3 and hubble parameter at the present epoch @xmath4 .",
    "also the best fit plots for redshift evolution of average deceleration parameter @xmath6 and the growth of matter perturbations in terms of evolution of growth factor @xmath5 with redshift @xmath38 ( best fit plots ) remain unaffected when the values of @xmath25 and @xmath24 are altered accordingly .",
    "therefore it is difficult to provide a unique dark energy eos @xmath0 for the thawing dark energy models as different values of @xmath25 with different values of @xmath24 lead to the same cosmological dynamics . * the best fit values and the @xmath37 c.l.s of eos at the present epoch @xmath31",
    "does leave little trace on model discrimination for thawing dark energy . here",
    "we discuss the fact that the values of @xmath25 and @xmath24 can be constrained by @xmath10 ( @xmath39 ) plots @xcite for thawing dark energy models .",
    "more importantly , best fit @xmath10 plots can also serve as a model discriminator for the thawing dark energy models .",
    "the non - linear @xmath10 plots can be realized for values of @xmath25 other than @xmath40 with different values of @xmath24 .",
    "this is an important issue as pngb and cpl parameterizations can result only in linear @xmath10 plots and recent works on scalar field dark energy models point towards the non - linear @xmath10 plots @xcite . *",
    "most importantly , the model - independent parameters like statefinder pair @xmath41 @xcite and the so called @xmath8 @xcite parameter do play a crucial role in discriminating among different dark energy models .",
    "study of these parameters in the context of our generalized thawing model , therefore , reveals the fact that unlike the standard parameters mentioned in 2nd major conclusion above , these parameters indeed serve as model discriminators for different thawing dark energy models i.e. , these parameters can identify the different values of @xmath25 as well as @xmath24 in our generalized model . + the paper is organized as follows . in the next sec .",
    "we propose the generalization for the thawing dark energy models and mention the standard as well as the model independent parameters .",
    "3 briefly describes the various observational data we used . in the sec .",
    "4 we present the results obtained by the analyses of the various observational data . in the sec .",
    "5 we discuss our results and put forward the conclusions of the present work .",
    "we propose a minimal two parameter generalization for thawing dark energy eos @xmath0 as , @xmath42 where @xmath22 is an arbitrary function of scale factor @xmath14 of the universe .",
    "we study the dynamical universe with radiation , matter and thawing dark energy obeying the proposed eos @xmath0 with @xmath43 .",
    "the proposed choice of @xmath22 here , for the generalized thawing model is motivated by the following findings :    \\i ) for @xmath26 and @xmath27 , our model is exactly same as cpl parametrization ( eq [ cpl ] ) .",
    "\\ii ) for @xmath26 and @xmath44 ( f being the parameter described in sec .",

    "the results with higher values of @xmath25 are shown by the green ( @xmath56 ) and blue plots ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the dotted , solid and dot - dashed lines in these cases corresponds to @xmath57 respectively .      in this section",
    "we discuss the constraints on the model parameters of our genralized thawing dark energy eos as proposed in the work by caldwell @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ nc ] red region shows the allowed region of the parameter space @xmath58 which is allowed for thawing dark energy with our generalized eos .",
    "it is also necessary to point out that our generalized eos can represent dark energy models other than thawing .",
    "the region of @xmath58 parameter space except the red zone represents these models .",
    "this allowance of @xmath25 and @xmath24 values in fig .",
    "[ nc ] is also reflected in fig .",
    "[ w - wexample ] .",
    "as is well - known , any dark energy model must at least probe three parameters directly from observations :    \\i ) the present value of equation of state ( eos ) for dark energy ( @xmath31 )    \\ii ) the present value of matter density ( @xmath3 )    \\iii ) the hubble parameter today ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "nevertheless , dark energy model building today is tightly constrained by several observations , which , taken together , leave out a very narrow window through which the model should pass .",
    "so , from today s perspectives , apart from the above three good old parameters , the supplementary parameters which one needs to address are the following :    the statefinder pair @xmath41 @xcite serves as a geometrical diagnostic to probe the properties of dark energy in a model independent manner .",
    "this pair @xmath41 has been studied extensively in the earlier works @xcite . for the late universe ( @xmath59 ) , which is well approximated by the presence of matter and dark energy",

    "the @xmath70 parameter proposed by sahni @xcite , is another tool to distinguish the dynamical dark energy from the cosmological constant .",
    "the uncertainty in matter density parameter allows significant errors in cosmological reconstructions of dark energy .",
    "@xmath70 parameter can in practice differentiate between the models , independent of the matter density parameter .",

    "the three - point diagnostic @xmath8 @xcite is defined by , @xmath79 for @xmath64 model @xmath80 .",
    "another dimensionless parameter , which is useful for determining the beginning of cosmic acceleration in dark energy model , is the average deceleration parameter @xmath6 , defined as @xcite , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the deceleration parameter .",
    "we use eqs .",
    "( [ r ] , [ s ] , [ om3 ] , [ qaveqn ] ) for evaluating the statefinder pair @xmath41 , @xmath8 and @xmath6 for the case of our generalization of thawing dark energy model .",
    "further more , we investigate the growth factor @xmath5 in the context of this proposed generalized thawing eos . for this purpose",
    "we assume the generalized thawing dark energy models proposed here , are decoupled from the cold matter sector .",
    "this would lead to the effect that the galaxy cluster formation is not directly influenced by the existence of dark energy .",
    "but the presence of dark energy alters the hubble expansion rate which affects the growth of inhomogeneities in the cold matter sector . in the linear regime of matter perturbations , the evolution of the inhomogeneities are governed by the relation @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the matter density contrast with @xmath85 being the matter density .",

    "the growth factor @xmath5 is affected by dark energy models via @xmath91 .",
    "for the purpose of putting constraints on the generalized thawing dark energy eos , we use the latest supernova type ia ( sne ia ) data from the union 2.1 compilation @xcite , observational hubble data ( ohd ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background data ( cmb ) from 9 year wmap results @xcite and boss data from sdss - iii @xcite .",

    "however , in cosmology , with the rapid increase of the number of data points @xmath117 ( we remind the reader that we have used combined dataset ) , eq ( [ bic ] ) shows that the @xmath113 value is always going to increase with introduction of new model parameter(s ) @xmath118 .",
    "this does not essentially mean that the models with least number of parameters are always favored by observations , though it may appear to be so .",
    "for example , we know @xmath64 model ( with the least number of parameters ) @xcite fits the sne ia data only in the low redshift region i.e , for @xmath119 , and in this vein , most of the models pay the price just because they have additional parameters , though they , in fact fair well with observations . on this note it should be mentioned that , as demonstrated in @xcite the above information criteria should better be replaced by bayesian evidence calculation , which gives a value after integrating over all probable states , and hence , does not suffer from any such limitations of aic or bic .",
    "hence , nowadays , most of the cosmological models are relying more on bayesian evidence calculation , rather than @xmath120 or @xmath113 calculation .",
    "we hope to address this issue in near future .",
    "we are in the era of precision cosmology .",
    "observational data are improving day by day .",
    "but these are the error bars that the data come with makes the constraints on the models poor .",
    "therefore it is very necessary to reduce the error bars which can improve the constraints on the model parameters further .",
    "we used type ia supernova data , baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey data , observational hubble data and the cosmic microwave shift parameter data to constrain the models parameters . among all these data supernova data influences the analysis",
    "the most i.e. , the constrained parameters space depend on supernova data to a great extent .",
    "supernovae data are not that precise at the present moment as it comes with large error bars",
    ". improving supernova data can probably give us the improved and satisfactory results in future .",

    "<S> we propose a two parameter generalization for the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) @xmath0 for thawing dark energy models which includes pngb , cpl and algebraic thawing models as limiting cases and confront our model with the latest observational data namely sne ia , ohd , cmb , boss data . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis reveals that the phantom type of thawing dark energy is favoured upto @xmath1 confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> these results also show that thawing dark energy eos is not unique from observational point of view . though different thawing dark energy models are not distinguishable from each other from best - fit values ( upto @xmath2 c.l.s ) of matter density parameter ( @xmath3 ) and hubble parameter ( @xmath4 ) at present epoch , best - fit plots of linear growth of matter perturbation ( @xmath5 ) and average deceleration parameter ( @xmath6 ) </S>",
    "<S> ; the difference indeed reflects in best - fit variations of thawing dark energy eos , model - independent geometrical diagnostics like the statefinder pair @xmath7 and @xmath8 parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we are thus led to the conclusion that unlike the standard observables ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) , the model - independent parameters ( @xmath9 ) and the variations of eos ( in terms of @xmath10 plots ) serve as model discriminators for thawing dark energy models .    </S>",
