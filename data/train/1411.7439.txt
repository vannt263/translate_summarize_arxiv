    "digital devices such as samplers , quantizers , and communication channels play an indispensable role in low - cost , intelligent control systems .",
    "this has motivated researchers to study control problems with limited information due to sampling and quantization , as surveyed in  @xcite . on the other hand , many systems encountered in practice have switching among several modes of operation .",
    "the stabilization problem of switched systems has also been studied extensively ; see the book @xcite , the survey  @xcite , and many references therein .    both sampling / quantization and switching are discrete - time dynamics and often appear in control systems simultaneously .",
    "the authors of @xcite have studied quantized control for markov jump discrete - time systems . in @xcite , the stabilization of markov jump systems with uniformly sampled mode information is investigated . however , for switched systems with deterministic switching signals , most works deal with sampling / quantization and switching separately . based on the result in @xcite ,",
    "our previous work  @xcite has developed an output encoding strategy for switched system under an average dwell - time condition  @xcite but have not considered sampling .",
    "the following difficulty arises from partial knowledge of the switching signal due to sampling : switching can lead to the mismatch of the active modes between the plant and the controller .",
    "accordingly , we need to prepare for another encoding strategy in case switching occurs . for the quantization at the next sampling time ,",
    "an encoding strategy after a switch happens must include the estimation of intersample information , e.g. , the state behavior in the sampling interval , from the transmitted data .    for switched systems with sampling and quantization , _ state _",
    "feedback stabilization has been studied under a slow - switching assumption in @xcite . by contrast , we assume that the information on the quantized _ output _ and the active mode of the plant is transmitted to the controller at each sampling time .",
    "the objective of this paper is to develop an encoding and control strategy achieving global asymptotic stabilization for given state feedback gains .",
    "the detection of switching within each sampling interval requires a dwell - time assumption . on the other hand",
    ", we also use an average dwell - time assumption for the convergence of the state to the origin .",
    "our proposed method can be seen as the extension of @xcite from state feedback to output feedback and also that of @xcite from non - switched systems to switched systems .",
    "a data - rate bound derived from our result is that from  @xcite maximized over all the subsystems .",
    "we organize this paper as follows . in section ii , first we show the switched linear system and the information structure we consider . after placing some basic assumptions , we state the main result .",
    "section iii is devoted to the so - called `` zooming - out '' stage , whose objective is to measure the output adequately . in section iv",
    ", we provide the encoding and control strategy that makes the state converges to the origin , and obtain a bound on the set in which the estimation error can reach when a switch occurs . in section v , we show that the lyapunov stability is achieved . and section vi contains a numerical example .",
