    "in a high energy collision between two hadrons or a photon and a hadron it takes a finite amount of time for the reaction products to evolve to physical particles . during the collision process some momentum transfer between the hadrons or some hard scattering between two of the hadrons constituents leads to the excitation of hadronic strings .",
    "the time that is needed for the creation and fission of these strings as well as for the hadronization of the string fragments can not be calculated within perturbative qcd because the hadronization process involves small momentum transfers of typically only a few hundred mev .",
    "one can perform an estimate of the formation time @xmath4 in the rest frame of the hadron .",
    "it should be of the order of the time that the quark - antiquark ( quark - diquark ) pair needs to reach a separation that is of the size of the produced hadron ( @xmath5  fm ) : @xmath6    during their evolution to physical hadrons the reaction products will react with reduced cross sections .",
    "this is motivated by means of color transparency : the strings and the substrings created during the fragmentation are in a color singlet state and therefore mainly react via their color dipole moment which is proportional to their transverse size . for a collision inside nuclear medium",
    "this means that during their formation time the produced hadrons travel with a reduced scattering probability .",
    "hence the formation time plays an important role in the dynamics of nuclear reactions , e.g. heavy ion collisions , proton and pion induced reactions as well as photon and electron induced reactions on nuclei .",
    "the latter two are of special interest because they are less complex than heavy ion collisions and instead of hadron induced reactions the primary reaction does in general not only take place at the surface of the nucleus but also at larger densities .",
    "experiments at tjnaf and desy , for example , deal with exclusive and inclusive meson photo- and electroproduction at high energies .",
    "large photon energies @xmath7 are of special interest because the formation length @xmath8 in the rest frame of the nucleus can exceed nuclear dimensions : @xmath9 if one chooses the formation time to be @xmath10  fm / c , the formation length     that contribute to incoherent meson photoproduction in simple glauber theory .",
    "the left amplitude alone would lead to an unshadowed cross section .",
    "its interference with the right amplitude gives rise to shadowing.,width=302 ]    in the rest frame of the nucleus will be about 30  fm for a 5  gev pion and about 7  fm for a 5  gev kaon or a 7  gev @xmath11 meson .",
    "these lengths have to be compared with the typical size of nuclear radii , e.g. 2.7  fm for @xmath12c and 7.1  fm for @xmath13pb .",
    "the formation time has therefore a big effect on photonuclear production cross section at high energies .",
    "+ to extract informations about the formation time one needs a realistic description of the final state interactions ( fsi ) of the reaction products .",
    "since photon induced reactions are known to be shadowed ( @xmath14 ) above @xmath15  gev  @xcite , one also needs a way to account for this shadowing effect in photoproduction .",
    "this is straight forward within glauber theory  @xcite but in simple glauber theory the fsi are purely absorptive . a more realistic coupled channel description of the fsi is possible within a transport model .",
    "we use a semi - classical transport model based on the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) equation to describe the fsi .",
    "originally developed to describe heavy ion collisions  @xcite at sis energies it has been extended in later works to investigate also inclusive particle production in heavy ion collisions up to 200  agev and @xmath16  @xcite and @xmath17 induced as well as photon and electron induced reactions in the resonance region  @xcite .",
    "inclusive photoproduction of mesons at energies between 1 and 7  gev has been investigated in  @xcite .",
    "an attractive feature of this model is its capability to describe a large variety of different reaction types .",
    "however it is not clear how to account for coherence length effects such as shadowing in a semi - classical transport model .",
    "a first attempt has been made in  @xcite , in the next section we present a new , better way to implement shadowing in our model .",
    "within our model we can only calculate the incoherent part of the photon nucleus cross section and we use glauber theory to calculate coherent processes such as , e.g. , coherent vector meson photoproduction .",
    "note that the main part of the difference between the nuclear photoabsorption cross section and the incoherent photoproduction cross section at large energies stems from coherent @xmath1 photoproduction . for a detailed discussion of the used transport model and the way how to implement the shadowing effect we refer to @xcite and @xcite . in our model",
    "the reaction of a high energy photon with a nucleus takes place in two steps . in the first step the photon reacts with one nucleon inside the nucleus ( impulse approximation ) and produces some final state @xmath18 . in this process nuclear effects like fermi motion , binding energies and pauli blocking of the final state nucleons are taken into account . in the second step the final state @xmath18 is propagated within the transport model .",
    "except for the exclusive vector meson and exclusive strangeness production ( see  @xcite ) we use the lund string model fritiof  @xcite in our model to describe high energy photoproduction on the nucleon . the particle production in fritiof",
    "can be decomposed into two parts .",
    "first there is a momentum transfer taking place between the two incoming hadrons leaving two excited strings with the quantum numbers of the initial hadrons .",
    "after that the two strings fragment into the observed particles . as a formation time we use 0.8  fm / c in the rest frame of each hadron",
    "; during this time the hadrons do not interact with the rest of the system . since fritiof does not accept photons as incoming particles we use vector meson dominance ( vmd )  @xcite @xmath19 and pass the photon as a massless @xmath1 , @xmath20 or @xmath21 with a probability corresponding to the strength of the vector meson coupling to the photon times its nucleonic cross section .",
    "+     divided by @xmath22 plotted versus the photon energy @xmath7 .",
    "the solid line represents the result of reference  @xcite and the dashed line shows the incoherent part calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : intinc ] ) .",
    "more than 90% of the difference is due to coherent @xmath1 photoproduction.,width=377 ]    in glauber theory shadowing of incoherent meson photoproduction arises from the interference between the two amplitudes depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : glauber ] .",
    "the left amplitude corresponds to the process where the photon directly produces the meson @xmath18 at nucleon @xmath23 .",
    "the second amplitude of order @xmath24 shows the process where the photon first produces a vector meson @xmath25 on nucleon @xmath26 without excitation of the nucleus .",
    "this vector meson then propagates at fixed impact parameter @xmath27 ( eikonal approximation ) to nucleon @xmath23 to produce the final state meson @xmath18 and leaving the nucleus in the same excited state as in the left amplitude .",
    "the fsi of the outgoing meson @xmath18 are usually treated via a purely absorptive optical potential and lead to an exponential damping of the nuclear production cross section @xmath28 $ ] . if one knew the amplitudes @xmath29 and @xmath30 one would just have to replace the purely absorptive fsi by our transport model",

    "( [ eq : aeffdens ] ) . in both cases the nucleons on the front side of the nucleus shadow the downstream nucleons .",
    "this effect is stronger for the @xmath1 component because of its larger nucleonic cross section.,width=529 ]    start from ( [ eq : vmd ] ) and use glauber theory  @xcite to calculate how the single @xmath25 components of the photon change due to multiple scattering on the way to nucleon @xmath23 where the state @xmath18 is produced : @xmath31 here @xmath32 denotes the ( photon energy dependent ) nuclear profile function .",
    "the cross section for the photon to react with nucleon at position @xmath33 inside the nucleus can be deduced via ( [ eq : gamma ] ) from the optical theorem @xmath34 like for the photon in vacuum each term gives the relative weight for the corresponding photon component to be passed to fritiof . when integrated over the whole nucleus one gets from eq .",
    "( [ eq : inccs ] ) the total incoherent photonuclear cross section @xmath35 which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : abscs ] together with the total nuclear photoabsorption cross section as calculated in  @xcite .",
    "more than 90% of the difference between those two cross sections stems from coherent @xmath1 photoproduction . in fig .",
    "[ fig : aeff ] we show how strongly the @xmath1 and the @xmath21 component of a real 20  gev photon are shadowed in pb",
    ". we plot @xmath36 as a function of @xmath37 .",
    "one clearly sees that due to its smaller nucleonic cross section the @xmath21 component is less shadowed than the @xmath1 component at the backside of the nucleus .",
    "this means that strangeness production ( e.g. @xmath38 production ) , where the primary reaction is preferably triggered by the @xmath21 component of the photon , is less shadowed than for instance inclusive @xmath16 production .",
    "this dependence of the strength of shadowing on the reaction type is new compared to the shadowing in  @xcite and can also be seen directly from the second amplitude in fig .",
    "[ fig : glauber ] because of the occurrence of the scattering process @xmath39 at nucleon @xmath23 . + as already mentioned above the purely absorptive fsi of the glauber model are very different from the coupled channel description of a transport model . the transport model we use",
    "is based on the buu equation that describes the time evolution of the phase space density @xmath40 of particles that can interact via binary reactions . in our case",
    "these particles are the nucleons of the target nucleus as well as the baryonic resonances and mesons ( @xmath16 , @xmath41 , @xmath11 , @xmath38 , ... ) that can either be produced in the primary @xmath42 reaction or during the fsi . for particles of type @xmath26",
    "the buu equation looks as follows : @xmath43.\\ ] ] in the case of baryons the hamilton function @xmath44 includes a mean field potential which in our model depends on the particle position and momentum . the collision integral on the right hand side accounts for the creation and annihilation of particles of type @xmath26 in a collision as well as elastic scattering from one position in phase space into another . for fermions pauli blocking",
    "is taken into account in @xmath45 via pauli factors . for each particle",
    "type @xmath26 such a buu equation exists ; all are coupled via the mean field and the collision integral .",
    "this leads to a system of coupled differential - integral equations which we solve via a test particle ansatz for the phase space density @xmath46     production on @xmath13pb at @xmath47  gev .",
    "the meaning of the different curves is explained in detail in the text .",
    "all the curves , except the one with the explicitly given formation time @xmath10  fm / c have been calculated with @xmath48.,width=377 ]    for a system of non interacting particles ( @xmath49 ) this leads directly to the classical equations of motion for the test particles : @xmath50 since the collision integral also accounts for particle creation in a collision the observed outgoing particle @xmath18 can not only be produced in the primary reaction but can also be created by side feeding in which a particle @xmath51 is created first which propagates and then , by fsi , produces @xmath18 .",
    "in addition the state @xmath18 might get absorbed on its way out of the nucleus but be fed in again in a later interaction .",
    "both cases can a priori not be ignored but are usually neglected in glauber models .",
    "exclusive vector meson photo- and electroproduction on nuclei is an ideal tool to study the effects of the coherence length , formation time and color transparency .",
    "it has been investigated at hermes  @xcite at photon energies between 10  gev and 20  gev and @xmath52  5  gev@xmath53 .",
    "+ the calculations for meson production on nuclei are usually done within simple glauber theory  @xcite . as already mentioned above the fsi in glauber theory are usually purely absorptive .",

    "now we can , for technical reasons , perform calculations only for real photons up to an energy of about 7  gev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : exclrho ] we show the results for the mass differential cross section of incoherent @xmath1 photoproduction on @xmath13pb for @xmath47  gev .",
    "the solid line represents a calculation where the primary reaction is @xmath57 .",
    "it already includes the effects of shadowing , fermi motion , pauli blocking and the nucleon potential , but no fsi .",
    "the dotted line shows the effect of the fsi without a formation time of the @xmath1 in @xmath57 .",
    "the simple glauber model yields exactly the same result , which means that fsi processes like ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 where the primary @xmath1 gets absorbed first and is fed into the outgoing channel by a later fsi are negligible . if one assumes a formation time of @xmath10  fm / c for the @xmath1 one gets the result indicated by the dash - dotted line . due to the finite formation time",
    "there is less absorption and the nuclear production cross section increases . if the spectrum looked like this one would in glauber theory",
    "be lead to the conclusion of a finite @xmath1 formation time .",
    "+ however , one will get a similar result with @xmath48 if one allows for other primary reaction besides @xmath57 and uses a coupled channel model .",
    "this can be seen by looking at the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : exclrho ] . in this case one finds that the main part of the additional @xmath1 stem from inclusive @xmath1 production in the primary event , e.g. @xmath60 where the @xmath16 gets absorbed during the fsi .",
    "one could now apply an exclusivity measure like in the hermes experiment @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the 4-momentum of the undetected final state and @xmath63 is the nucleon mass , with -2  gev@xmath640.6  gev .     for exclusive @xmath1 production on @xmath13pb at @xmath47  gev .",
    "the meaning of the different curves is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : exclrho].,width=377 ]    this leads to a decrease of the cross section ( dash - dot - dotted line ) because some of the inclusive primary events are excluded .",
    "if the exclusivity measure was good enough to single out only the exclusive primary events , the curve would coincide with the dotted line and glauber theory would be applicable .",
    "since this is not the case , one still extracts an incorrect formation time when using simple glauber theory .",
    "one therefore needs an additional constraint to make glauber theory applicable .",
    "this becomes clear by examining the differential cross section @xmath65 in fig .",
    "[ fig : exclrho2 ] .",
    "the meaning of the lines are as before .",
    "one can see that for @xmath66  gev@xmath53 the full calculation with exclusivity measure ( dash - dot - dotted line ) gives the same result as the one with the primary reaction @xmath57 and fsi ( dotted line ) .",
    "this means that only in this kinematic region glauber theory can be used . in the hermes experiment",
    "one makes a lower @xmath67 cut to get rid of the @xmath1 stemming from coherent @xmath1 photoproduction . in the case of lead and @xmath47",
    "gev the coherent part can be neglected above @xmath68  gev@xmath53 .",
    "if one wants to apply glauber theory one will need to increase this threshold to approximately @xmath69  gev@xmath53 to suppress contributions from inclusive @xmath1 . +     ( left ) and @xmath3 ( left ) for @xmath12c and @xmath13pb plotted as a function of the photon energy .",
    "the solid line represents the full calculation .",
    "the dash - dotted line shows the result without shadowing of the incoming photon , the dashed line the result without fsi and the dotted line the calculation without formation time.,width=529 ]    one sees that glauber theory can be trusted only under certain kinematic constraints . to describe less exclusive reactions one needs a more realistic description of the fsi . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kaons ] we show the cross section for the reactions @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the photon energy range 1 - 7  gev for @xmath12c and @xmath13pb which has already been investigated in  @xcite .",
    "the solid curve in fig .  [ fig : kaons ] represents the results of the full calculation ( including shadowing , fsi , @xmath10  fm / c , etc . ) . by comparison with the calculation without shadowing ( dash - dotted line )",
    "one sees how important shadowing becomes at high energies . at 7",
    "gev it reduces the nuclear production cross section to about 75% for carbon and 65% for lead .",
    "the importance of a full coupled channel treatment of the fsi becomes clear when looking at inclusive @xmath2 production .",
    "since the @xmath72 quark can not be absorbed in medium the fsi can just increase the @xmath2 production via processes like @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) for example .",
    "this one finds by comparison with the calculation without fsi ( dashed line ) . as a consequence of this",
    ", a shorter formation time will lead to an increase of the @xmath2 production cross section as can be seen from the dotted line .",
    "the reason is that with decreasing formation time the primarily produced pions have a greater chance to produce @xmath2 in the fsi . as already mentioned in the introduction for @xmath10  fm / c the formation length of fast pions is larger than the nuclear dimension , so that they will leave the nucleus without further scattering .",
    "an enhancement of the @xmath2 production cross section due to fsi can of course not be explained by purely absorptive fsi as in simple glauber theory .",
    "the @xmath3 can also be absorbed via processes like @xmath75 .",
    "this effect compensates the production due to fsi in @xmath12c and dominates in @xmath13pb as can bee seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : kaons ] .",
    "we have shown that high energy photoproduction off nuclei offers a great possibility to study the physics of hadron formation .",
    "however , one needs a reliable model of the fsi to extract the formation time from the production cross sections . whereas glauber models allow for a straight forward implementation of the nuclear shadowing effect they usually have the disadvantage of a purely absorptive treatment of the fsi .",
    "as we have shown the latter might lead to a wrong estimate of the formation time if the kinematic cuts are not chosen properly .",
    "a more realistic treatment of the fsi is possible within a coupled channel transport model .",
    "however in such a model it is not totally clear how to account for the shadowing effect .",
    "we have presented a method to account for these coherence length effects which can easily be extended to higher energies and virtual photons .",
    "this will be done in future work so that we can study the effects of formation time and color transparency in particle production in the hermes regime  @xcite .",
    "we will also investigate charm production since we expect the same fsi effect as observed for the @xmath2 also for the @xmath76 .",
    "in addition , we plan to implement a more realistic time dependence of the cross section for the produced particles during their evolution which might again modify the extracted formation time .",
