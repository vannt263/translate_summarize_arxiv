    "however , they are often left out in galaxy modeling as they increase the complexity significantly . as star formation and large - scale galactic dynamics",
    "are influenced crucially by magnetic fields , it is necessary to know how magnetic fields have formed and evolved in time for solving the details of galaxy evolution .",
    "+ various scenarios for the origin of galactic magnetic fields have been proposed .",
    "the first seed fields could have been created in the very early universe - during inflation @xcite or within phase transitions @xcite . however , due to cosmic expansion these fields have become extremely weak at the onset of galaxy formation .",
    "stronger fields are expected from plasma mechanisms like the biermann battery ( @xmath5 g , @xcite ) or from aperiodic plasma modes ( @xmath6 g , @xcite ) . at present day",
    ", galaxies like the milky way have field strengths of approximately @xmath7 g @xcite which means that seed fields must have been amplified over many orders of magnitude during the galactic evolution .",
    "one of the best candidates for amplification is the turbulent small - scale dynamo .",
    "this process converts kinetic energy from turbulence into magnetic energy by randomly stretching , twisting , and folding field lines .",
    "as the dynamo operates , at least initially , on small spatial scales it is very fast @xcite . in the context of galaxy formation",
    "the turbulent dynamo has been studied with semi - analytical models @xcite and also in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "these studies show that equipartition field strengths can be reached on timescales of the order of @xmath8 yr @xcite .",
    "we note , that the ordering of field lines as observed in galactic disks should take place on longer timescales which are typical for large scale motions . for instance",
    "the rotation period of the milky way is @xmath9 yr . + based on the recent studies @xcite showing efficient dynamo amplification in young galaxies , we expect strong galactic fields also in the early universe . to test this theoretical scenario",
    "we can study non - thermal radio emission from cosmic rays .",
    "while these highly energetic particles consist mostly of protons , the electrons are responsible for synchrotron emission due to their smaller mass .",
    "the origin of this emission is the spiral motion of the electrons around the magnetic field lines providing a probe of its strength and structure across a galaxy .",
    "this commonly used method is limited by the availability of information about the cosmic ray electron spectrum @xcite .",
    "theoretical models for the steady - state distribution of cosmic rays that are related to other galaxy properties like the star formation activity are needed to predict the synchrotron emission .",
    "in fact , with these models it is possible to also estimate radio fluxes from galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "+ one hint towards a strong coupling between the different energy components in a galaxy is the far - infrared ( fir)-radio correlation . @xcite",
    "observe this correlation of the fir and the radio luminosity over more than five orders of magnitude .",
    "this tight correlation can be interpreted as a strong coupling between star formation and magnetic fields via cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "the star formation rate is traced by the fir luminosity that results from thermal emission of dust heated by uv radiation from young stars .",
    "for instance , @xcite reports a linear scaling between the bolometric fir luminosity , e.g.  integrated between 8 @xmath10 m and 1000 @xmath10 m , and the star formation rate .",
    "a higher star formation rate is also accompanied by the occurrence of more turbulence @xcite .",
    "this leads to stronger magnetic fields produced by small - scale dynamo amplification .",
    "in addition , with the formation of more stars more supernova explosions occur which produce more cosmic rays in their shock fronts .",
    "we thus expect the non - thermal radio emission to increase with increasing star formation .",
    "the fir - radio correlation is well - tested in the local universe . while until today no clear evidence for an evolution of this correlation has been observed up to moderate redshifts @xcite , a deviation from its present - day shape is nevertheless discussed in literature @xcite .",

    "+ the fir luminosity correlates with the radio luminosity in the local universe @xcite . as the origin of this correlation is a strong coupling between star formation and magnetic fields , the responsible contribution to the radio emission is the non - thermal synchrotron radiation .",

    "the smaller @xmath56 value compared to the linear fits can be traced back to the slope of our curve which does not match the data perfectly .",
    "still as the @xmath56 for our model is high , we can consider it to reproduce the local observations well .",
    "we stress again that the orange curve in figure [ plot_lfir_lradio ] is not based on a fit and that we can not expect a perfect agreement with the data .",
    "while the fir - radio correlation is well tested in the local universe , its evolution with redshift is less clear .",
    "for example , @xcite can not confirm any evolution of the correlation up to @xmath74 for their galaxy sample .",

    "an additional model has been presented by @xcite . with their one - zone galaxy model that includes a detailed cosmic ray description",
    ", they also predict an evolution of the fir - radio correlation with redshift which is most significant for galaxies with low star formation rates . in this section",
    "we use our theoretical model for galaxies , their cosmic rays , and their dynamo - produced magnetic fields to predict this correlation at very high redshift .",
    "+ we employ the model that was derived in section [ sec_model ] to calculate the radio luminosity density as a function of the fir luminosity at different redshifts .",

    "any possible redshift evolution of the dust is not taken into account in this work .",
    "note that the transition from the milky way type regime to the high-@xmath0 starburst regime occurs at @xmath75 which corresponds to @xmath76 .",
    "the resulting @xmath0-dependent correlation is shown in figure [ plot_lfir_lradio ] . with increasing redshift @xmath77 clearly decreases for a given @xmath1 .",
    "this originates from the decreasing energy loss timescale of cosmic ray electrons ( see figure [ plot_timescales_sfr2 ] ) .",
    "the results are fewer cosmic rays thus less synchrotron emission .",
    "moreover , our model predicts the fir - radio correlation to flatten slightly with increasing redshift . in figure [ plot_lfir_lradio ] the difference between a strong and a weak evolution of the gas density ( [ eq_n ] ) with redshift",

    "the most significant difference is the timescale for bremsstrahlung which is smaller by a factor of three in our case .",
    "in addition we include losses by galactic winds that are in our model dominant for a large range of @xmath12 at @xmath3 and low cosmic ray energies ( see figure [ plot_timescales_sfr2 ] ) . above a critical redshift that is defined by the time where @xmath81 becomes smaller then @xmath82 , @xcite",

    "we extend the approach by @xcite and calculate the expected synchrotron emission based on the steady state number density of cosmic ray electrons . in agreement with their prediction",
    "we find that @xmath81 decreases rapidly with redshift and that synchrotron emission is not the dominate loss channel in young galaxies . instead of a breakdown of the fir - radio correlation",
    "we find an evolution in cosmic time where non - thermal radio emission significantly decreases with redshift .",
    "due to our focus on starburst galaxies with strong , i.e.  efficiently amplified magnetic fields , the inverse compton scattering is less relevant than other loss mechanisms , which may change when probing more typical galaxies .",
    "such variations in the overall efficiency in the production of non - thermal synchrotron are not only relevant as probes of the magnetic fields , but also when employing radio emission as a tracer of star formation .",

    "@xcite on the other hand propose an evolution of the fir - radio correlation that is only significant at low star formation rates .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy lies probably in the different models of the density .",
    "while there is a scaling with the star formation rate in both studies ( see our equation [ eq_n ] ) , @xcite do not include a scaling of @xmath24 with redshift . with our scaling of @xmath85 that is motivated from the evolution of the galactic volume ( [ eq_vgal ] ) the timescales of ionization and bremstrahlung decrease strongly with redshift ( see figure [ plot_timescales_sfr2 ] ) .",

    "is directly coupled to the star formation rate density ( see equation [ eq_n ] ) . * with our cosmic ray model and a scaling of the magnetic field strength with the star formation rate that remains similar at high redshift we calculate the galactic synchrotron emission .",
    "the results for a milky way like galaxy and a typical high-@xmath0 starburst are shown in figure [ plot_snu_nu ] .",
    "we compare here the observed synchrotron flux with conservative sensitivity values of current radio telescopes .",
    "we find that detection of non - thermal radio emission is possible up to @xmath4 . especially at high redshift free - free absorption at low and free - free emission at high",
    "@xmath41 makes multi - frequency observations necessary .",
    "* we calculate the radio luminosity density at @xmath99 ghz and estimate the corresponding fir luminosity using the relation to the star formation rate from @xcite .",
    "the resulting fir - radio correlation is presented in figure [ plot_lfir_lradio_newfit ] .",
    "here we compare our theoretical prediction with the observational data of local galaxies from @xcite . without adjusting the parameters of our model we find good agreement with the observational data at @xmath3 .",
    "* we study the evolution of the fir - radio correlation with redshift in figures [ plot_lfir_lradio ] , [ plot_lfirlradio_sfr ] , and [ plot_lfirlradio_z ] . due to the increasing energy losses of cosmic ray electrons the radio luminosity decreases with redshift .",
    "this leads to a smaller fir - radio correlation for younger galaxies .",
    "moreover , the slope of the correlation becomes smaller with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "how much the correlation changes depends strongly on the scaling of the gas density @xmath33 . for @xmath35 our model",
    "predicts a significant evolution of the fir - radio correlation with redshift over the entire range of star formation rates that is already visible at @xmath4 .",
    "if the @xmath0-dependence of the density is weaker , i.e.  @xmath36 , a modification of the correlation could only be detected at @xmath100 .",
    "our theoretical galaxy model should be testable in future radio observations . a current survey with",
    "the jvla is chiles _ _ con pol _ _ which will provide the deepest window into the radio sky up to date .",
    "the survey covers the cosmos field and thus deep observations in various wavelengths are already available .",
    "chiles _ con pol _ will be able to test the fir - radio correlation up to cosmological redshifts . with a high angular resolution and a enormous sensitivity the ska as well as its pathfinders like lofar and askap will be powerful telescopes to observe galactic radio emission in the early universe .",
    "the expected sensitivity of the ska__-mid _ _ is roughly 0.3 @xmath10jy for an exposure time of 8 hours .",
    "the synchrotron emission from typical high-@xmath0 starburst galaxies , like our fiducial galaxy smm j2135 - 0102 , can be detected up to @xmath4 according to our theoretical model for the evolution of cosmic rays and galactic magnetic fields . for longer integration times",
    "the flux sensitivity decreases and radiation from more distant sources can be observed .",
    "for instance an 100 hour integration would push the sensitivity to 0.07 @xmath10jy and magnetic fields at a redshift of 5 and above could be studied .",
    "+ the combination of new radio observations and theoretical models like the one presented in this work will be important for better understanding of galaxies .",
    "in particular , we will gain more insights in the evolution of galactic magnetic fields , cosmic rays , and star formation which are closely coupled .",
