    "the circular polarization of sio maser radiation is observed to be about 3% when averaged over the circumstellar shell of a representative late - type giant .",
    "it reaches a few tens of percent in particular features of this and other late - type giants ( barvainis , mcintosh & predmore 1987 ; kemball & diamond 1997 , hereafter kd ) . in the standard interpretation that circular polarization is due to the zeeman effect",
    ", the magnetic fields would be 10 - 100  g and would cause a pressure that greatly exceeds the expected thermal pressure in the masing gas .",
    "the averaged linear polarization is about 30% . in ordinary optics ,",
    "circularly polarized radiation is created when the electric field of linearly polarized radiation is not along one of the optical axes of the medium in which it is propagating ( e.g. , rossi 1957 ) . in astronomy , circular polarization in starlight is created in this way as a result of the changing orientation of the alignment of dust grains caused by changing directions of the galactic magnetic field ( e.g. , spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "near the convective atmospheres of late - type giants , it seems especially likely that irregularities will occur in the magnetic field structure . to have distinct optical axes ,",
    "the medium must be anisotropic .",
    "the observation of the strong linear polarization of the sio maser radiation indicates that the medium is anisotropic at this frequency .",
    "this anisotropy and hence the linear polarization is almost certainly the result of anisotropic pumping of the magnetic substates caused by an anisotropic angular distribution of the infrared radiation that is involved in determining the populations of the masing states ( western & watson 1983 , 1984 ; nedoluha & watson 1990 ) .    in a previous investigation ,",
    "we ( nedoluha & watson 1994 ) have shown that the rotation of the optical axes necessary for creating the observed circular polarization can be caused by the competition between the magnetic field @xmath0 and the beam of maser radiation .",
    "this occurs when the zeeman splitting parameter @xmath1 in frequency units [ @xmath2(mg)s@xmath3 for these sio masers ] is comparable with the rate @xmath4 for stimulated emission by the maser radiation , and @xmath4 is greater than or equal to the decay rate @xmath5 for the molecular states so that the maser is at least partially saturated ( @xmath6 s@xmath3 is commonly accepted for these sio masers ) .",
    "further exploration of the cause for the circular polarization nevertheless seems to be warranted . even for modest @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath7 is likely instead of the required @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , when @xmath8 calculational methods ( involving density matrices ) are necessary that are unfamiliar in astrophysics . as a result ,",
    "the `` non - zeeman possiblity '' seems to have received less attention than it merits .",
    "when @xmath7 , the physics is straightforward because the relevant equations for the transport of polarized maser radiation are identical with those for ordinary radiation except for the sign of the optical depth .",
    "circularly polarized radiation is then created from linear in a manner that is essentially identical with the familiar results from ordinary optics for likely changes in the orientation of the magnetic field along the line of sight .",
    "the relevant , coupled differential equations of radiative transport for the stokes intensities to describe polarized radiation , including the possibility of a changing magnetic field and anisotropic populations , are given in convenient form by deguchi & watson ( 1985 , esp .",
    "section iiic ) and by wallin & watson ( 1997 ) ( cf .",
    "kylafis & shapiro 1983 ) .",
    "simplifications that are standard result from recognizing that the spectral line breadth is much greater than the zeeman splitting for sio masers .    to understand the potential magnitude of the circular polarization that can be created , first consider the simplified example in which the direction of the magnetic field rotates uniformly along the path of a ray in an unsaturated maser .",
    "because the weak circular polarization can be treated as a perturbation , the analytic solutions for the linear polarization in wallin & watson ( 1997 ) can be utilized . in the unsaturated limit for a fractional linear polarization @xmath9 less than about 1/2 , the fractional circular polarization reduces to @xmath10 when the magnetic field rotates by about one radian along the ray . here , the @xmath11 s are the imaginary and real parts of the line shape function which are similar in magnitude at representative locations within the spectral line except near line center where @xmath12 . for the typical @xmath13 ,",
    "the resulting @xmath14 is in excellent agreement with the average @xmath15 that is observed .    to provide a plausible quantitative description for the variations of the magnetic fields as a basis for assessing in more detail how well these can lead to the observed magnitudes and patterns of the polarizations ,",
    "we adopt a kolmogorov - like dependence for the power spectrum of the magnetic field .",
    "kolmogorov spectra tend to appear in various contexts , including simulations for other astrophysical environments ( e.g. , stone et al .",
    "specifically , we utilize the form @xmath16@xmath17@xmath18 for the power spectrum of the vector potential as a function of wave number @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 corresponds to the strict kolmogorov variation .",
    "the constant @xmath21 is chosen to yield the desired rms value for the field .",
    "representative field configurations ( or `` realizations '' ) are constructed by statistical sampling for these fourier components from a gaussian distribution . a turbulent velocity field , which would likely accompany a turbulent magnetic field ,",
    "is created in the same manner .",
    "these two fields are created independently .",
    "these methods are standard and are described in detail elsewhere ( e.g. , wallin , watson , & wyld 1998 ) .",
    "the magnetic and velocity fields are obtained in this manner at the grid points of a @xmath22 rectangular array .",
    "the coupled differential equations of radiative transport for the stokes intensities are then integrated numerically for rays that propagate parallel to the axis with 256 grid points to give the stokes intensities for the @xmath23 rays that emerge perpendicular to that face of the rectangular volume .",
    "although radiative saturation is not required for creating circular polarization by the mechanism under investigation , we do attempt to include the effects of saturation in at least an approximate way for the minority of rays for which saturation is significant .",
    "we treat each ray as if it is an independent `` linear maser '' .",
    "that is , the radiative intensities used for computing the molecular populations that are needed for the transfer equations of a particular ray are those of the ray itself .",
    "treating saturation does tend to increase somewhat the fractional polarizations .",
    "within the simplifications of this calculation , the results do not depend upon the actual magnitude of the magnetic field , only upon its direction .",
    "four quantities must be specified to perform the calculations  the slope of the power spectrum of the fields as expressed by @xmath24 , the ratio of the rms turbulent velocities to the rms thermal velocity of the sio molecules , the pumping rate averaged over all magnetic substates , and the difference between this pump rate for the @xmath25 and for the @xmath26 magnetic substates ( the anisotropy ) . a power spectrum ( @xmath27 ) that is steeper than kolmogorov seems to yield a somewhat more regular pattern for the map of the linear polarization .",
    "we present computations for a ratio of four for the rms turbulent to thermal velocity .",
    "this turbulence is modest and subsonic since the sound speed is determined mainly by the hydrogen .",
    "including turbulent velocities does not alter significantly the average fractional circular polarization that can be created , but it does provide the opportunity to explore the appearance of the maps and of the spectral line profiles .",
    "the substate averaged pump rate is reflected in the intensity of the maser radiation .",
    "our choice is determined by the requirement that the brightness temperature of the stronger rays be approximately what is typical of the observations ( about @xmath28 k ) .",
    "the anisotropy in the pumping is adjusted so that the computations yield the average linear polarization of one - third that is observed .",
    "the simplification is made that the pumping is independent of velocity and of the orientation of the magnetic field . to be compatible with the observational selection based on intensity ,",
    "we consider approximately the strongest 300 rays for creating our maps and obtaining averaged quantities .",
    "maps of the linear polarization that we calculate based on a representative statistical realization are presented in figures  [ fig1]a and  [ fig1]b .",
    "another simplification in our calculations is the omission of the velocity gradients that would likely be associated with an outflowing wind in these stellar envelopes and would cause the ring structure that is evident in the analogous observational maps ( e.g. , kd ) .",
    "our maps can be viewed as more indicative of a portion ( perhaps one - quarter ) of the observed ring .",
    "the tendency in the observations for the pattern of the linear polarization to vary smoothly despite the turbulence in the magnetic field appears in the simulations , as does the observed occurence of occasional rapid changes in its direction between nearby locations .",
    "the addition of a uniform magnetic field in figure  [ fig1]b does , as expected , increase the tendency for order in the pattern of the polarization .",
    "the tendency for a relatively smooth pattern in the linear polarization despite the turbulence can be understood as a result of the kolmogorov - like form in which the variations with the longest wavelengths ( here , the dimensions of the rectangular volume ) have the largest amplitudes .",
    "the `` richness '' in the possible variations of the polarization characteristics across a spectral line are evident in figures  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] .",
    "ordinarily the profile of the linearly polarized radiation is similar to that for the total intensity , though the position angle can change by tens of degrees and sometimes by much more across the spectral line . in contrast",
    ", the profile of the stokes circular polarization v can either be mostly of one sign and similar in shape to that of the intensity , or it can be an antisymmetric `` s - curve '' ordinarily associated with the zeeman effect . if there were no velocity gradients in our calculations , the v - spectra would always have the shape of the s - curve even though the circular polarization is not due to the zeeman effect .",
    "note that the computed v - spectra are often shifted somewhat relative to the profiles for the intensity .",
    "the main result here is , of course , that fractional circular polarization is calculated without the zeeman effect and is comparable to what is observed for plausible assumptions about the circumstellar environment . in agreement with observations ,",
    "the fractional circular polarization averaged over the maps is about three percent , though it can range up to much larger values at certain locations ",
    "up to more than twenty percent within the spectral line as shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the requirement for the calculation here is that @xmath1 be somewhat greater than the larger of @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( which are comparable for the computations in the figures ) . making the usual assumption that @xmath5 is approximately the inverse radiative lifetime ( 5  s@xmath3 ) for a vibrational transition of the sio molecule then leads to the requirement that the magnetic field be greater than only about 1030  mg for the observed circular polarization , instead of being equal to the 10100  g that would be implied by the zeeman interpretation .",
    "if the magnetic field were weaker than about 10  mg , the optical axes of the medium would not be determined by the magnetic field and their orientations would thus not follow the changes in the directions of the field .",
    "since circular polarization is created from the linearly polarized radiation ( and , specifically @xmath29 in the simplified example in the foregoing ) , a close correlation might be expected between the linear and circular polarization in the radiation of individual masing features .",
    "this is not found to occur in our calculations .",
    "the statistical variations in the velocity and in the magnetic field apparently introduce sufficient scatter that this correlation is effectively destroyed . for the maps as a whole ,",
    "however , the average fractional circular polarization does tend to increase with the average fractional linear polarization .",
    "if circumstellar ( or other ) environments with a large number of masing features occur for which the average of @xmath15 is much greater than the average of @xmath30 , it seems most likely that the circular polarization of these would be due to causes other than those described in this letter .",
    "it would probably be due to the standard zeeman effect .",
    "discriminating between the zeeman and this non - zeeman effect based on the observed spectral line profiles of the polarized radiation does not seem likely since the intrinsic profiles for stokes v due to the two effects are similar ( antisymmetric `` s - curves '' ) .",
    "these intrinsic profiles can be altered in the emergent radiation for both as a result of saturation together with gradients in the velocity and the magnetic field along the line of sight .",
    "finally , we can not exclude the possibility that non - zeeman effects similar to those in this letter can contribute to the observed circular polarization of the 22 ghz water masers ."
