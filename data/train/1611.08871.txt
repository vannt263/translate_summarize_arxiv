    "in proton beam therapy treatment planning , analytical descriptions of the treatment beams are commonly used to determine the dose deposited in clinical patient models .",
    "although monte carlo based methods have become faster during the last few years , there still is a distinct advantage of using more efficient , analytical models when having to perform multiple calculations such as in the process of 4d robust  optimization and adaptive therapy .",
    "this advantage has greater significance in the case of pencil beam based proton therapy , where multiple small beams need to be tracked and calculated . despite all these advantages , analytical algorithms",
    "have been shown to be less reliable in clinically more complex treatments like lung and breast treatments@xcite , which prompted this effort to provide a more accurate description of the dose deposition by a scanned proton beam .",
    "in addition , a more analytical description provides greater insight in the macroscopic process of how a pencil beam behaves physically in a medium as issues such as energy and medium vary .    a pencil beam entering",
    "a medium will generate secondary particles such as scattered neutrons , generated photons , @xmath4rays and large angle scattered protons that produce a _ nuclear halo _ of dose around the central beam axis .",
    "although , in the region away from the central axis , the contribution from a single pencil beam is small , a complex treatment plan is made of many pencil beams and the summation of the lateral contributions could be significant .",
    "the lateral extent of a beam at different depths is illustrated in figure [ depth_change ] .",
    "monte carlo  based calculation showing changes in lateral dose deposition for a pencil beam of nominal energy of 230 mev .",
    "a logarithmic scale is used to better illustrate the difference in contributions from the nuclear halo and the primary particles . ]    the description and treatment of the nuclear halo has been the focus of research by a number of groups who have proposed various methodologies describing the effects in an analytical way .",
    "gottschalk et al .",
    "provided an in - depth analysis of all the physical processes contributing to the nuclear halo , subdividing a pencil beam into a combination of four distinct regions ; core , halo , aura and ( possibly ) spray ; in the pencil beam@xcite .",
    "this approach requires up to 25 different physical parameters to characterise the beam . in most implementations ,",
    "the contribution from the nuclear halo is solved by adding different distributions to a central gaussian distribution describing the core of the pencil beam .    the first proposed solution for the nuclear halo by pedroni et al .",
    "added another , broader gaussian to the core ; a methodology that is implemented in the varian eclipse ( varian medical systems , palo alto , ca ) calculation algorithm@xcite .",
    "the simplicity of this calculation also allowed for faster gpu implementation@xcite . in further refinements of this approach , other groups attempted combinations of gaussian , lorentz ( also known as cauchy ) and lvy distributions@xcite , increasing the complexity of the fitting procedure and necessitating look - up tables for the various parameters . a key insight that enables our novel approach is that each of these methods combine two or more stable functions in their analytical representation . a further clinically used algorithm for pencil beam calculation",
    "is used in raystationtps ( raysearch laboratories , stockholm , sweden ) . in this system",
    ", each spot is modelled as a superposition of 19 gaussian distributions ( 19 sub - spots : 1 at the center , and 6 and 12 positioned at two concentric circles around the center)@xcite .",
    "in this paper we review the concept of stable distributions and show that they can be used to represent the evolution of a proton pencil beam in a medium .",
    "we demonstrate that this approach provides a more accurate description of the pencil beam and is more efficient than the use of normal distributions , or a sum thereof .",
    "furthermore , we show that this parametrization allows interpolation of non  measured energies from measured ( or calculated using monte carlo ) depth profiles .",
    "finally , we implement this algorithm in an open source treatment planning toolkit , matrad@xcite .",
    "stable distributions are a class of distributions which generalize a property of the normal distribution .",
    "namely , they extend the central limit theorem which says that if the number of samples drawn from random variables , _ with or without _ finite variance , tends to infinity , then the measured distribution tends to a stable distribution",
    ". if the variance is finite , the resultant distribution tends towards the normal distribution , a member of the class of stable distributions .",
    "other than for specific cases , these distributions do not possess an analytical representation .",
    "it is therefore necessary to describe them in terms of their characteristic function which always exists for a given stable distribution .",
    "more generally , the characteristic function , @xmath5 , of a distribution is the fourier transform of the probability function , @xmath6 , of that distribution , e.g. : @xmath7 it can be shown that all stable distributions can be characterised as having the same characteristic function , @xmath5 , barring a change in the parameters @xmath8 .",

    "the parameter @xmath13 $ ] determines the shape of the distribution , @xmath14 $ ] is a measure for symmetry , @xmath15 $ ] is a scale factor and @xmath4 a position , or the most probable value@xcite . for a symmetric , zero centred distribution the equation [ cf_long ] reduces to : @xmath16 in an appendix",
    "we show from first principles that this equation represents all symmetric zero  centered distributions that follow the central limit theorem",
    ".    as @xmath17 and @xmath18 can vary continuously there are an infinite number of stable distributions , most of which do not have an analytical representation in real space .",
    "indeed , only for @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is a closed form known .",
    "these correspond to , respectively , the gauss , lorenz , and lvy  distributions .    using this generalization",
    "it is possible to define a class of uni  modal distributions whose properties can be exploited to describe physical random walk processes which combine different physical properties@xcite .",
    "the provision center for proton therapy is currently operational using an iba cyclotron which provides proton beam scanning technique up to a maximum energy of 230 mev . for this work ,",
    "the provision beams from 98 to 230 mev were accurately reproduced by the monte carlo code fluka by adapting the simulated beams to the commissioning experimental beam data@xcite . at each energy , the beam is defined at the surface of the phantom by a two - dimensional normal distribution characterized by position and standard deviation , @xmath23 . using fluka ,",
    "the dose distribution in medium ( water ) is calculated in a 200x200x350 mm@xmath24 cube with 1 mm@xmath24 tally volumes . the calculated dose distribution in each 200x200 slice perpendicular to the beam axis is then considered to be a two  dimensional dose distribution .",
    "generation of secondary particles under the form of gamma s , neutrons and @xmath4rays was enabled .",
    "the simplest approach of analytically predicting the behavior of the dose deposited by a proton beam is based on a gaussian parametrization with the width of the beam defined by a variable standard deviation , @xmath23@xcite .",
    "this implies that at any given depth the lateral dose deposition can be described as : @xmath25    in commercially available algorithms it was seen that this approach did not predict the contributions of pencil beams further away from the beam axis in an adequate way .",
    "indeed in the eclipsetreatment planning software , developed by varian ( varian medical systems , palo alto , ca ) , an additional gaussian term is used to describe this , as proposed by pedroni _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "raystation ( raysearch , stockholm sweden ) also employs such a strategy introducing multiple off axis gaussian contributions . in the remainder of the paper we will only concentrate on the two gaussian solution ,",
    "which is parametrized as follows : @xmath26 with @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "this parametrization implies that to fit the behaviour of a proton pencil beam at a given depth we need to determine three parameters : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "because the majority of stable distributions do not possess an analytic form ; it is difficult to use the classical approach to fit the data .",
    "indeed , the fitting of stable distributions is the subject of scientific research by itself .",
    "we opted to use a maximum likelihood estimation based on pre  computed spline approximations@xcite .",
    "in essence it selects the distributions that match the pre  computed ones the best .",
    "once the parameters are determined , the characteristic function is calculated in complex space and using an inverse fourier transform the actual stable distribution was generated , a straightforward methodology also proposed by mittnik et al.@xcite .    the resulting curve",
    "could then be compared with the monte carlo simulation .    to fit the normal distribution based algorithms , a classical methodology using a least square fit of the analytical function based on a levenberg ",
    "marquardt algorithm@xcite was used .",
    "both the stable and gaussian fit were compared to the monte carlo simulation using pearson s @xmath31 measure .",
    "@xmath32 the @xmath31 value for @xmath33 degrees of freedom then yields the probability that the fitted distribution is different from the simulated one , with @xmath34 being the number of parameters in the fit . for stable parametrization @xmath35 ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , for a double gaussian @xmath36 ( @xmath28 , @xmath28 , and @xmath30 ) .",
    "we denote the @xmath31 value for normal and stable distribution as respectively @xmath37 and @xmath38 .      for all pencil beams with nominal energy ( @xmath39 )",
    "the centrally located transversal distribution is extracted at all available depths ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "subsequently , the normalised stable distribution parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 are determined using the above - mentioned fitting procedure . in a first approximation",
    "we consider the pencil beams to be circularly  symmetric .",
    "finally , the total integral dose at each depth @xmath42 is also calculated .",
    "this procedure yields three parameters which vary as a function of depth and nominal beam energy allowing us to calculate the dose distribution at any depth in a homogeneous medium .",
    "we propose a methodology to determine the beam characteristics of intermediate energies from two provided beam characterisations .",
    "let @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 be the parameters fully describing a proton pencil beam with nominal energy @xmath46 .",
    "then it is possible to calculate the parametrization of an intermediate energy @xmath47 by interpolation of the parametrization of energies @xmath46 and @xmath48 disregarding a scaling in the depth parameter which depends on the range of the given energy .",

    ", we determine the minimal amount of beams we need to fully characterize in order to obtain a full set of data across all nominal energies .",
    "we choose a threshold of 1% error determining the width of the beam ( @xmath18 ) and 3% for the shape ( tailedness ) ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the total deposited energy needs to be correct to 1% dose and 1 mm position .      to allow testing of our parametrised beam model with clinical patient plans",
    ", we implemented the stable distribution dose calculation algorithm in an open source treatment planning system , matrad ( dkfz , heidelberg , de ) .",
    "matrad is written in matlab ( mathworks , natick , ma ) and provides functionality for importing patient data , ray tracing , inverse planning and treatment plan visualisation .",
    "the proton dose calculation component was extended to support a beam model described by a stable distribution , in addition to single and double gaussian models .    to provide radial symmetry of the beam ,",
    "a 2d normalisation is required when computing the lateral profile in a plane of distance @xmath1 into a medium .",
    "if @xmath54 is the value of the stable distribution that describes the 1d beam profile at a distance @xmath55 from the central axis , the 2d beam profile is described by : @xmath56 where , @xmath57 is the distance from the pencil beam central axis and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the parametrization at depth @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath58 is the normalisation required such at the volume under the 2d distribution is unity and is calculated using the shell formula as : @xmath59 as there is no analytical representation in real space for stable distributions except when @xmath17 equals specific values , numerical computation of this integral is required to provide the normalisation . to increase efficiency ,",
    "the integral @xmath58 is pre  calculated for each combination of @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the discrete beam parametrization and is interpolated as required within the dose calculation engine .",
    "figure [ v_variation ] shows that @xmath58 varies smoothly within the relevant range of parameter space .",
    "the 2d normalisation parameter , @xmath58 varies smoothly over the relevant range of the parameter space defined by @xmath17 and @xmath18 and is therefore interpolated as required within the dose calculation engine . ]",
    "the parameters required to fully characterise the knoxville beam at all energies were implemented in : namely , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and the integrated dose at a distance @xmath1 along the beam path .",
    "this implementation allows complex treatment plans to be generated .",
    "figure [ fit1]a ) shows the lateral dose deposition at a depth of 20 cm for a proton pencil beam with nominal energy of 226.08 mev with two parameterizations : the appropriate stable distribution and a double gaussian . from visual inspection of the graph ,",
    "it is clear that the stable distribution provides a better fit to the beam profile at this energy and depth .",
    "the fit of each parameterization is quantified by calculating the @xmath31-values , yielding @xmath60 for a single gaussian distribution ( not plotted ) , @xmath61 for the stable distribution , and @xmath62 for a double gaussian .",
    "this corresponds to a probability of 0 , 1 , and 1 , for the lateral dose distributions to be represented by the respective fits .",
    "figure [ fit1]b ) plots the @xmath38value at each calculated lateral point in the beam profile where a value of 0 is a perfect fit at that point .",
    "this graph shows that each of the three distributions provides an adequate representation of the dose close to the centre of the beam . for the gaussian distribution ,",
    "the @xmath31values for each point quickly deviates substantially , showing that this distribution does not represent the range behaviour adequately beyond @xmath6310 mm .",
    "the double - gaussian fit provides a good estimation of the beam profile to a distance of @xmath6360 mm , however it becomes clear that there is a systematic underestimation of the dose faraway which increases the @xmath31value .",
    "furthermore , this parameterization requires the most variables to describe the system .",
    "the stable distribution provides the best fit of the profile of a proton pencil beam at this energy and depth .",
    "the effectiveness of these systems increases the number of variables needed to describe the system and depends on the region of interest ( i.e. the size of the region taken into account to measure the tail contributions ) .",
    "the behaviour of a proton pencil beam , as commissioned at the provision facility can be parametrised at a given depth and for a specific nominal energy using two parameters from the stable distribution fit : @xmath17 , describing the tail of the distribution and @xmath18 providing the width .",

    "a final parameter is the integral dose @xmath64 deposited at that depth ( fig .",

    "the @xmath17 parameter reflects the increased contribution of interactions with longer range , most likely from scattered protons .",
    "the contribution diminishes due to two factors : 1 ) the decrease of generated secondary protons due to the lower energy of the primary protons , and 2 ) the decrease in energy of the secondary protons .",
    "figure [ interpol ] shows the methodology interpolating the data from two energies to generate data for a third beamlet . in the remaining figures we calculate the maximal error of the parametric representation . due to the non  linearity of the parameters behavior as a function of energy",

    "it becomes clear , for instance , that the scattering properties of combined scanned beams are different depending on the depth of the treated volume , and therefore different dose characteristics and maybe even biological effects can be expected .",
    "this because there might be variations of let depending on the contributions of the halo at various depths .",
    "it also provides a method to describe issues like changes in medium in terms of the used parameters . in a forthcoming study",
    "we have already established that not all parameters behave in the same manner as a function of depth combined with changes in material ( data not shown ) .    in this current study",
    "we considered the pencil beam to be isotropic .",
    "in practise it is possible that that is not the case depending on the geometric properties of the machine used to generate the pencil beams .",
    "for instance , many proton therapy facilities will use spatially sequential magnets to bend the beams in the directions perpendicular to the beam axis in two perpendicular directions to each other .",
    "this results in an ellipsoid spot size due to a different virtual source positions .",
    "the implication is that we have to find a way to combine different stable distributions . in the case of the normal distribution",
    "this is well understood , i.e. combining the variations depending on the mixing angle .",

    "in that case the strong law of large numbers can be replaced by a weaker version : @xmath79 which then becomes a degenerate function if infinite samples are taken , but more importantly , before reaching the degenerate condition the sum tends to the normal distribution , which is the classical form of the the central limit theorem .",
