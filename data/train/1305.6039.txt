    "frustrated magnetism in kagome heisenberg antiferromagnetic systems ( khaf ) has been a major subject in condensed matter physics due to their unconventional , exotic ground states which emerge from the interplay between geometrical frustration and low - dimensional quantum effects.gfm2005,gfm2011 in particular , quantum fluctuations for @xmath15 systems are found to be strong among khaf and can lead to interesting behavior like that of a spin liquid.@xcite theoretical studies on ideal @xmath15 isotropic khaf lattice have demonstrated that it has a resonating valence bond ( rvb)-like disordered ground state.@xcite recent numerical studies @xcite have also predicted that its ground state is a spin liquid with a small spin - gap ( @xmath16 ) of @xmath17 to its triplet excited state ( where @xmath18 is the exchange interaction between nearest - neighbor ( @xmath19 ) spins ) .",

    "more sensitive heat capacity measurement are being planned to clarify this issue .",
    "overall we conclude that the intrinsic origin of this transition is an open question .",
    "the entropy change @xmath161 calculated from the magnetic heat - capacity is about @xmath162 j / mol k cu , which is in good agreement with the expected @xmath163  ( @xmath164 j / mol k ) for @xmath165 systems .",
    "the @xmath166 value at transition @xmath12 is found to be @xmath167 j / mol k cu , which is @xmath168 of the total entropy and the rest of the entropy is released in the paramagnetic region well above @xmath12 , suggesting the presence of frustrated correlations .",
    "the observation of significant entropy well above ordering temperature is generally observed in frustrated spin systems.@xcite additionally , nearly all the entropy change has taken place by the time one approaches ( with decreasing temperature ) the @xmath13 transition .",
    "this is the reason i presume that @xmath169 is a weak transition such as a slight canting from the af ordered state to produce weak fm moment .",

    "however , our magnetic measurements on polycrystalline and single crystal samples show the onset of lro at about @xmath214 k with a change in the spin - order around @xmath158 k. this indicates the existence of significant three - dimensional couplings .",
    "the @xmath2 is found to obey the simple curie - weiss law above @xmath10 k with a curie constant as expected for a paramagnetic system .",
    "however , below @xmath215 k there is a deviation from the curie - weiss behavior though it is well above @xmath216 , which suggests the presence of frustrated spin correlations well above @xmath216 .",
    "this behavior is also consistent with @xmath3 which infers the presence of magnetic entropy well above the magnetic transitions .",
    "we performed electronic structure calculations to determine the relative values and importance of various exchange paths .",
    "our results suggest the presence of various intra - kagome ( @xmath27 and diagonal ) and inter - kagome exchange hopping paths , which then must be responsible for the onset of lro in this system .",
    "detailed neutron diffraction measurements will be helpful to understand more about the nature of spin orderings and magnetic phase diagram of this system .",
