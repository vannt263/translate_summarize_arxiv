    "the description within a physical context of driven non - equilibrium complex systems has frequently been made by considering that their dynamical behaviour is characterised by spatial - temporal fluctuations of some parameter , @xmath0 .",
    "usually , this parameter has been considered to be the ( inverse ) temperature , the dissipation of energy in turbulent flows , the amplitude of gaussian white noise , the _ local _ mean - reverting value or the _ local _ variance . as an example , we mention the standard case of a brownian particle diffusing along an inhomogeneous medium in which temperature ( hence diffusion constant ) fluctuates in both space and time . in this approach , as it can be understood , there are two important time scales : the scale in which the dynamics is able to reach a stationary state ( assuming a fixed value for parameter @xmath0 ) , and the scale at which the fluctuating parameter evolves .",
