    "finite - temperature field theory @xcite is the natural framework for the study of phase transitions , and of the thermodynamic properties of equilibrium states .",
    "applications range from the investigation of the phase structure of the strong and electroweak interactions , and the related applications to the early universe , to the low - energy effective field theories in particle physics and condensed matter systems .",
    "however , finite - temperature field theories often face a major difficulty : the plain perturbation expansion @xcite is ill - defined due to the presence of infrared divergences in the bosonic sector , and often gives meaningless results . in the case of hot qcd ,",
    "for instance , one can say that the domain of validity of the naive weak - coupling expansion is the empty set @xcite .",
    "this challenge stimulated the development of resummation techniques that reorganize the perturbative series , and resum certain classes of diagrams , thereby improving the perturbative expansion ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "some of these techniques amount to using an effective theory in order to separate the scales @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "others use modified quasi - particles as the starting point of the perturbative expansion @xcite , leading to a significant improvement of the convergence of the expansion when the mass of these quasi - particles is properly chosen ( one can also mention refs .",
    "@xcite , where a simple phenomenological model of massive quasi - particles was successfully used in order to reproduce the pressure of the quark - gluon plasma obtained in lattice simulations ) . in other approaches that aim at maintaining thermodynamical consistency ,",
    "one reorganizes the perturbative expansion of the thermodynamical potential around two - particle irreducible skeleton diagrams @xcite .",
    "finally , some of these techniques are based on a systematic use of the hard thermal loop effective action @xcite , i.e. , on the assumption that the htls provide a good description of the quasi - particles in the plasma , and of their interactions .    a somewhat different approach , which can also be interpreted as a resummation of an infinite set of perturbative diagrams , is provided by the semiclassical approximation @xcite .",
    "since the partition function of a given system can be cast in the form of a path integral whose weight is the exponential of minus the euclidean action , an expansion around _",
    "euclidean _ classical solutions is quite natural .",
    "this program has been carried out in the case of one - dimensional quantum statistical mechanics for particles in a single - well potential in @xcite , and also for double wells @xcite . from the mere knowledge of the classical euclidean solutions of the equation of motion ,",
    "the full semiclassical series for the partition function was constructed .",
    "later , these results were generalized to the case of a particle in a central potential in an arbitrary number of dimensions @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "excellent results were obtained , for instance , for the ground state energy and the specific heat , in the case of the quartic potential .    in this paper",
    "we develop a similar semiclassical procedure to compute the partition function for thermal scalar field theories with a single - well potential .",
    "we expand around euclidean classical fields , whose value on the boundaries of the time interval are taken to be independent of space .",
    "these solutions are assumed to be known to all orders in the interaction potential ( either analytically or numerically ) .",
    "then , we incorporate fluctuations around these classical trajectories , as well as space - dependent fluctuations of the boundary value of the classical fields .",
    "all these fluctuations are kept only in a gaussian approximation , although it is in principle possible to go systematically beyond this approximation .",
    "we also provide a diagrammatic interpretation of our results , connecting our formalism to the ordinary perturbative expansion , and identifying the classes of diagrams that are resummed in our approach .",
    "the implementation of the renormalization procedure in this semiclassical treatment is discussed in detail at the end .",
    "since the procedure we propose is infrared finite , we believe it represents an interesting alternative to other rearrangements of perturbation theory at finite temperature . in this paper",
    ", we present the general semiclassical framework for an arbitrary potential .",
    "we leave the application to the case of a scalar theory with quartic self - interactions , and comparisons with other methods to a following publication @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    in section [ sec : class_fluct ] , we discuss the computation of the partition function , starting from its expression in terms of a functional integral , within the semiclassical approximation .",
    "although the main result is , of course , well known , we focus our discussion on the role played by the boundary conditions in euclidean time at finite temperature .",
    "we also recall the diagrammatic interpretation of the integration over quadratic fluctuations around the classical field .    in section [ sec : exp_boundary ] , we present a systematic procedure to incorporate effects from fluctuations of the boundary value of the field in the computation of the partition function .",
    "we explain how one can perform an expansion in those fluctuations in a consistent way , provided that one knows the classical solutions for the problem with constant boundary conditions .",
    "we derive formulas that incorporate the effects of these fluctuations up to quadratic order .",
    "these formulas depend only on the classical field itself , and on a basis of solutions for the equation of motion for small fluctuations around the classical field .    in section [ sec : int_boundary ] , we expand the classical action to second order in the boundary fluctuations , and discuss diagrammatically the meaning of this expansion in terms of the boundary value of the field .",
    "this leads to our final expression for the partition function in terms of quantities that can be straightforwardly obtained in explicit form for a given potential once one knows the classical solution mentioned previously ( at least numerically ) .",
    "this expression , however , still needs to be renormalized .",
    "the renormalization procedure , which resembles the usual perturbative procedure , is discussed in section [ sec : renorm ] .",
    "there , we show how to obtain a finite expression for the partition function through the introduction of only two counterterms in the action , plus the subtraction of the zero point energy .",
    "we present our conclusions and outlook in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "finally , in the appendix , we illustrate the procedure in the case of the free theory .",
    "as mentioned above , the non - trivial example of the quartic potential will be addressed in detail in another publication .",
    "we want to calculate the partition function @xmath3 for a system of interacting scalar fields , making use of a semiclassical approximation .",

    ". it is well known that the gaussian integration over fluctuations above a given background field amounts to calculating the one - loop correction to the effective action .",
    "however , for this correspondence to be valid , one must integrate over _ all the periodic fields _ @xmath28 . in our case ,",

    "a typical diagram included in this quantity is displayed in figure [ fig : log_z_phi ] , in the case of a field theory with a quartic coupling .",
    "it is important to remember that the propagator represented by the dashed line differs from the complete time ordered propagator , because it corresponds to a subset of all the periodic modes .",
    "both the classical action and the determinant in eq .",

    "in fact , the classical solution @xmath21 can be represented diagrammatically as the sum of all the tree diagrams terminated by the boundary field @xmath9 . the easiest way to see",

    "( [ eq : green ] ) , the boundary in the spatial directions does not contribute to the classical field at the point @xmath40 because the free propagator decreases fast enough when the spatial separation increases .",
    "thus , we are left with only a contribution from the boundaries in time . at this point , since the boundary conditions for @xmath21 consist in specifying the value of the field at @xmath41 , while its first time derivative is not constrained , it is very natural to choose a green s function @xmath42 that obeys the following conditions , because the zero modes of this operator form a linear space of dimension 2 .",
    "the conditions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bound_prop ] ) are explicitly realized by  : @xmath43 where we denote @xmath44 . ]  : @xmath45 with this choice of the propagator , we obtain the following formula for @xmath8  : @xmath46_{\\tau^\\prime=-\\beta/2}^{\\tau^\\prime=+\\beta/2 } \\ ; , \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\label{eq : green1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this formula tells us how the classical solution @xmath21 depends on the boundary value @xmath9 .",
    "if the first term in the right hand side  involving the derivative @xmath47 of the potential  were not there , then the relationship between @xmath21 and the boundary value @xmath48 would be linear .",
    "this only happens in a free theory .",
    "when there are interactions , one can solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : green1 ] ) iteratively in powers of @xmath47 .",
    "this expansion can be represented diagrammatically by the sum of the tree diagrams whose `` leaves '' are made of the boundary field @xmath9 .",
    "an example of such a diagram is illustrated in figure [ fig : classfield ] , in the case of a @xmath49 interaction of the fields .",
    "notice that , when the boundary field is small , this sum of trees can be approximated by the zeroth order in the expansion in powers of @xmath47 , which is independent of the interactions .",
    "on the other hand , for large values of @xmath48 , it is important to keep the full sum of tree diagrams that are summed in @xmath21 , because all the terms in the expansion can be equally important .",
    "therefore , we already see an important feature of our approximation scheme : although the quantum fluctuations are only included at the 1-loop level , it treats the boundary field to all orders , allowing a correct treatment even for non - perturbatively large values of @xmath9 .",
    "the integration over boundary configurations that remains to be performed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : z2 ] ) makes the semiclassical approximation for @xmath4 rather involved ; first , we must solve the partial differential equation  ( [ eq : eomc ] ) for an arbitrary @xmath9 , and this will not be feasible analytically in general .",
    "even numerically , this is a very complicated task . besides that , the only functional integral over @xmath48 that one is able to perform analytically is a gaussian integral . in order to circumvent these problems ,",
    "we are forced to perform some further approximations .",
    "one can see readily in eqs .   that the classical equation of motion reduces to an ordinary differential equation in the case where the field @xmath9 on the boundary is a constant @xmath50 .",
    "in this case , the classical solution @xmath51 becomes a function @xmath52 of the time only  : @xmath53 such a simplification of the classical equation of motion would make the problem much more tractable by analytical or numerical methods .",
    "this remark suggests that we decompose the boundary field @xmath9 into a constant part @xmath50 , and a fluctuation @xmath54  : @xmath55 the solution of the classical equation of motion can therefore be expanded in a similar manner  : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is of order @xmath58 in @xmath59 ( there are terms of arbitrarily high order in @xmath59 if the equation of motion is non linear ) .",
    "having done this , we can rewrite the path integral over @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : z2 ] ) as follows  : @xmath60\\ ; e^{-s_{_e}[\\phi_c ] } \\ ; \\left [ { \\rm det}\\,\\left ( a^*[\\phi_c ] \\right ) \\right]^{-1/2}\\ ; . \\label{eq : z3}\\ ] ] notice that the integration over @xmath54 must be performed with the constraint that @xmath61 since the `` uniform component '' ( i.e. , the zero mode ) of the boundary condition is already included in @xmath50 .",
    "an unrestricted integration of @xmath54 would therefore overcount the contribution of this zero mode .    in the following",
    ", we are going to assume that the first term @xmath52 can be determined with an arbitrary accuracy  it can be determined analytically in certain cases , while in general it is obtained by solving numerically an ordinary differential equation .",
    "moreover , the dependence on @xmath62 will always be treated exactly .",
    "only the terms that are of higher order in the fluctuation @xmath59 of the boundary field will be treated in some approximate way .",
    "doing this allows us to preserve the benefits of treating correctly the interaction term when the boundary field is large , since only the fluctuations of the boundary field are assumed to be perturbative .    a natural approximation to obtain the dependence on @xmath59 is to do a gaussian approximation around @xmath63 . as we shall see shortly , in order to find the classical action @xmath64 $ ] at order two in the fluctuation @xmath54 of the boundary , it is enough to obtain the classical solution @xmath21 at order one in @xmath54 .",
    "moreover , to be consistent with the gaussian approximation for @xmath64 $ ] , we only need to evaluate the determinant at lowest order in @xmath54 , i.e. , at order zero .",
    "indeed , the gaussian integration over the fluctuations @xmath59 corresponds to a one - loop correction in the background @xmath62 .",
    "however , as we have seen in the previous section , the functional determinant in eq .",
    "( [ eq : z3 ] ) is already a one - loop correction .",
    "therefore , keeping the @xmath59 dependence in this determinant would give higher loop corrections when we integrate over @xmath59 , but only a certain subset of all the 2-loop corrections would be included .",
    "doing so is not forbidden by any fundamental principle , but it would arguably make the calculation more complicated ; and moreover this would alter the renormalization of the final result . indeed , as we shall see later , by not expanding in @xmath59 the functional determinant in eq .",
    "( [ eq : z3 ] ) , we will eventually obtain an expression whose ultraviolet divergences are precisely those of the one - loop effective action .",

    "( [ eq : eomc ] ) . by dropping all the terms that are of order higher than unity in @xmath67 (",
    "since they are at least of order two in @xmath59 ) , and using the equation obeyed by @xmath62 , we obtain the following ( linearized ) equation for @xmath67  : @xmath69\\phi_1=0\\ ; , \\label{eq : eom1}\\ ] ] with the boundary condition : @xmath70 in the following , we also need the green s formula for the variation @xmath67 of the classical field .",
    "the derivation is very similar to the derivation of eq .",

    "again , this propagator must obey the boundary condition @xmath73 in terms of the fluctuation @xmath59 and of the propagator , the first order correction to the classical solution reads : @xmath74_{\\tau^\\prime=-\\beta/2}^{\\tau^\\prime=+\\beta/2}\\ ; .\\ ] ] notice that , since the background field @xmath62 does not depend on space , the propagator @xmath75 depends only on the difference @xmath76 .",
