    "a certain kind of stellar explosion , known as _ type ia supernovae _ among astronomers , is currently explained by the thermonuclear explosion of an electron - degenerate stellar remnant @xcite .",
    "such an object , which is called a white dwarf , emanates from the burn - out of stars comparable in mass to our sun and is mainly composed of carbon and oxygen .",
    "if the white dwarf has a companion star in close orbit , it can grow by accreting material from the companion . under certain conditions , the white dwarf s mass will steadily increase and finally approach the _ chandrasekhar limit _ , which is the maximal mass that can be supported by the degeneracy pressure of electrons @xcite .",
    "as the temperature and density are increasing , thermonuclear burning of carbon and oxygen gradually sets in .",
    "close to the chandrasekhar mass , the conditions in the core of the white dwarf eventually pass a critical threshold @xcite .",
    "at this point , the rate of thermonuclear reactions rises rapidly , and a runaway is initiated , which incinerates and disrupts the whole star within a few seconds .",
    "the total energy release is of the order @xmath4 @xcite .    the thermonuclear combustion of degenerate carbon and oxygen of density in the range @xmath5 proceeds in the form of a deflagration @xcite .",
    "since the nuclear ash produced by the burning process has less specific weight than the surrounding unprocessed material , it becomes rayleigh - taylor unstable .",
    "since turbulence is subsequently produced , the flames get corrugated and folded @xcite . in consequence , there is a positive feedback mechanism of turbulence enhancing the burning and , according to state - of - the - art numerical simulations , eventually results in an explosion @xcite .",
    "although it can not be ruled out that a transition from the deflagration to a detonation might set in at some stage @xcite , turbulent deflagration plays a crucial role in the theoretical modelling of thermonuclear supernovae in any case .",
    "the subject of this article is the dynamics of flame fronts on length scales much smaller than the size of a chandrasekhar - mass white dwarf . to that end",
    ", an artificial scenario was set up .",
    "a turbulent flow is produced by means of stochastic stirring in a cubic domain subject to periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "thermonuclear burning is ignited in small spherical regions and subsequently evolved by means of the _ level set method _",
    "the complicated network of thermonuclear reactions encountered in a type ia supernova is substituted by the effective fusion of equal mass fractions of @xmath6c and @xmath7o to @xmath8ni and @xmath9he as representative reaction @xcite .",
    "the equation of state is dominated by the degenerate gas of relativistic free electrons .",
    "thus , the approximate relation @xmath10 applies , while the temperature has virtually no influence on the pressure .",
    "this is actually the reason for the runaway , because the negative feedback between heating and expansion in non - degenerate matter is absent .",
    "the exact equation of state has no analytic solution and must be integrated numerically .",
    "moreover , contributions from nuclei , photons and pair electron - positron pair creation at temperatures of the order @xmath11 are taken into account ( section 3.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the fluid dynamics is treated by means of the piece - wise parabolic method ( ppm ) within the framework of the euler equations @xcite .    in the corrugated flamelet regime of combustion , the flame propagation",
    "is affected by turbulence on length scales ranging from the gibson length up to the integral length scale @xcite . in general ,",
    "only the the largest length scales can be resolved in a numerical simulation . in order to account for the wrinkling of the flame surface on length scales smaller than the cutoff scale of a simulation , an effective propagation speed , the so - called turbulent flame speed , must be calculated .",
    "this involves a subgrid scale ( sgs ) model for the local budget of turbulence energy contained in numerically unresolved modes . in this article , we present a numerical study in which different variants of the sgs turbulence energy model are compared ( section 4.3 in @xcite ) . in particular , we adopted a dynamical procedure for the computation of sgs closure parameters .",
    "this procedure was proposed by kim and menon for the application in les of gas turbine combustor flows @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of deflagration is based on thermal conduction , as opposed to a detonation , which proceeds via shock compression . unburned material ( fuel )",
    "is heated in the vicinity of the reaction zone and thereby gets ignited .",
    "once heat generation is balanced by diffusion , the burning zone is propagating at a steady subsonic speed , and pressure equilibrium is maintained across the reaction zone .",
    "basically , this characterises what is commonly known as a _",
    "flame_. for chemical combustion , a distinction is made between _ premixed _ and _ diffusive _ flames .",
    "thermonuclear flames are trivially premixed , because no additional agent , like oxygen in most chemical burning processes , is required .",
    "the local propagation speed of the flame , which is solely determined by microscopic properties , is called the _",
    "laminar burning speed_. the notion of a flame applies , if fluid motions do not significantly disturb the burning process within the reaction zone , i.  e. , the characteristic time scale of burning is much smaller than the kinetic time scale of velocity fluctuations on length scales comparable to the flame thickness @xmath12 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath13 , where the gibson length scale @xmath14 is the smallest length scale on which the burning process is affected by fluid motion @xcite .",
    "the condition @xmath13 thus specifies the _ flamelet regime _ of combustion , which is reviewed in this section . for the thermonuclear combustion in c+o white dwarfs",
    ", it appears that the flamelet description is valid for @xmath15 @xcite . in thermonuclear supernovae ,",
    "most of the burning takes place at significantly higher densities .",
    "the width of the reaction zone , @xmath12 , is determined by the equilibrium between energy generation due to nuclear reactions and the rate of diffusion caused by thermal conduction (   128 in @xcite ) .",
    "the balance between these processes can be expressed in terms of their characteristic time scales , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the former is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the energy generated by the fusion of a unit mass of nuclear fuel , and @xmath20 is the rate of energy release per unit volume . the time scale of conduction , on the other hand , can be expressed as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the mean free path of the electrons , which contribute the major part of the thermal conductivity , and @xmath23 is the speed of sound . setting these two time scales equal , one finds that the _ flame thickness _ @xmath12",
    "is approximately given by @xmath24 defining the _ laminar flame speed _ by @xmath25 , we have @xmath26 the specific energy release for the fusion of @xmath6c and @xmath7o to @xmath8ni is @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the flame speed @xmath28 for the thermonuclear combustion of degenerate carbon and oxygen was computed numerically for a wide range of mass densities and nuclear compositions by timmes and woosley @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath29 and @xmath30 for equal mass fractions of carbon and oxygen at a density @xmath31 .",
    "so far , we have only been concerned with the microphysics of thermonuclear deflagration .",
    "let us now consider the combustion of c@xmath32o fuel in a state of turbulent motion . for brevity , we shall assume the case of steady isotropic turbulence , i.e.  a statistically self - similar hierarchy of vortices or eddies .",
    "each vortex of size @xmath33 has a characteristic velocity @xmath34 and an associated turn - over time @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath34 is small compared to the laminar flame speed @xmath28 , then the flame front will propagate through a region of size @xmath33 in a time much faster than the turn - over time @xmath36 .",
    "hence , the turbulent flow appears to be more or less `` frozen '' with respect to the burning process on these scales . for @xmath37 ,",
    "on the other hand , the front is significantly distorted while it is crossing a vortex of diameter @xmath33 .",
    "hence , there is a threshold scale on which burning decouples from turbulence .",
    "this is the _ gibson length _ @xmath14 , which is defined by @xcite @xmath38 at length scales @xmath39 , turbulence corrugates the flame and thereby increases its surface area .",
    "consequently , turbulence enhances the burning process and the release of heat is growing .",
    "this can be accounted for by introducing a _ turbulent propagation speed _ @xmath40 . in other words , averaging over regions of size @xmath33 , the flame front propagates with an effective speed @xmath40 greater than the laminar burning speed @xmath28 , which specifies the local speed of any portion of the flame smaller than @xmath14 .    for @xmath39 ,",
    "@xmath40 becomes asymptotically independent of @xmath28 .",
    "the fundamental hypothesis applied in this article is that @xmath40 is then given by the magnitude of the turbulent velocity fluctuations @xmath34 . in the framework of the phenomenological kolmogorov theory of isotropic turbulence @xcite",
    ", this velocity obeys the scaling law @xmath41 in the inertial subrange , i.e.  in the range of length scales which are neither affected by the viscosity of the fluid nor large - scale energy injection .",
    "therefore , @xmath42 the relation @xmath43 was first proposed by damkhler , who studied bunsen cones in the laboratory @xcite",
    ". further validation of this conjecture came from numerical studies @xcite . a motivation based on a theoretical analysis in the framework of the level set prescription",
    "was given by peters @xcite .",
    "in early studies of thermonuclear deflagration @xcite , a _ reactive - diffusive _ flame model with artifical diffusion and reaction rates was applied . in this approach , the thickness of the flame is artifically increased over several grid cells and the propagation speed is adjusted to a prescribed value . on the other hand , the _ level set method _ proposed by osher and sethian",
    "@xcite is a front tracking method which describes the interface separating ash from fuel as a genuine discontinuity .",
    "the interface is numerically represented by the set of all points for which a suitably chosen _ distance function _ vanishes , i.e.  the zero level set .",
    "this is a sensible approximation if the physical flame thickness is very small compared to the gibson scale . for the simulation of thermonuclear combustion in type ia supernovae , the level set method was implemented by reinecke @xcite .",
    "let @xmath44 be a signed distance function with the property @xmath45 .",
    "the absolute value @xmath46 is equal to the minimal distance of the point @xmath47 from the flame front at time @xmath48 .",
    "the front itself is given by the constraint @xmath49 , i.e.  it is represented by the zero level set @xmath50 . with the sign convention @xmath51 in regions containing burned material , the unit normal vector pointing towards unburned material is given by @xmath52 .",
    "the time evolution of the front @xmath53 is implicitly determined by the total time derivative of @xmath54 . for a certain point at the front , @xmath55 , we have @xmath56 the speed function @xmath57 is given by the sum of two contributions .",
    "firstly , the advection speed normal to the flame front , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the velocity of the fuel immediately ahead of the front in an eulerian frame of reference . and , secondly , the intrinsic propagation speed @xmath60 of the flame front relative the fuel .",
    "the local equation  ( [ eq : lset_loc ] ) can be formulated globally as well , without constraining the position @xmath47 to the flame surface .",
    "substituting the definition of the normal vector @xmath61 and expressing the speed function in the form @xmath62 , the evolution equation for the level set function at any point in space becomes @xmath63|{\\ensuremath{{\\boldsymbol \\nabla } } } g(x , t)|.\\ ] ] the advection part on the right - hand side can be treated with a finite - volume scheme , for instance , the ppm .",
    "the intrinsic front propagation is usually calculated by means of an entropy - satisfying upwind scheme . in general , non - planar fronts will develop sharp corners and the corresponding level set must be a weak solution : information about the initial conditions is lost , once a cusp has formed , and the subsequent evolution is irreversible .",
    "the corresponding entropy condition can be formulated in the following way : once a certain fluid element is burned , it remains burned thereafter .",
    "in fact , this implies the equivalent huyghen s principle in optics for the propagation of the front over an infinitesimal interval of time ( section  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "finally , in order to preserve the property @xmath45 , the updated distance function has to be corrected after each time step . in the implementation of reinecke , this is achieved by means of _ re - initialisation _",
    "@xcite .",
    "for the complete implementation of the level set technique , both the burned and the unburned state in an intersected numerical cell must be reconstructed from the jump conditions across the front . assuming that there is a volume fraction of unburned material @xmath64 , conservation of momentum imposes the constraint @xmath65 given the finite - volume averages @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    ". the volume fraction @xmath64 can be calculated by linearly interpolating the discrete numerical values of the distance function @xmath68 .",
    "supplementing the momentum equation with the rayleigh criterion , the hugoniot jump condition and the continuity constraint for the tangential velocity components , a non - linear system of equations is obtained .",
    "the solution yields @xmath59 , @xmath69 and the corresponding state variables ( cf .",
    "this procedure of _ in - cell reconstruction _ was indeed successfully implemented for chemical combustion problems @xcite .",
    "however , the deviation of the interpolated front element from the exact smooth solution can introduce significant errors in the reconstructed states .",
    "in particular , it is sometimes impossible to reconstruct physically sound states for degenerate matter , because of the stiffness of the equation of state .",
    "moreover , one faces topological ambiguities for certain configurations .",
    "a pragmatic method is to average over all possible values , whenever one of these rare cases is encountered @xcite .",
    "although rpke _ et al .",
    "_ have recently succeeded with the implementation of in - cell reconstruction for the problem of thermonuclear flame propagation in two dimensions @xcite , generalising the algorithm to three dimensions would be much more challenging .",
    "the difficulties outlined above are avoided with the so - called _ passive _ implementation , where the difference between burned and unburned states is neglected and the advection speed is set equal to @xmath70 .",
    "the discrete values of the velocity and state variables are then interpreted as cell - centred averages .",
    "this is a fair approximation in the limit of moderate density jumps between fuel and ash .",
    "a caveat of using the passive implementation for simulations of burning at low density is the generation of numerical artifacts .",
    "fortunately , these problems are mainly encountered for densities significantly less than about @xmath71 .",
    "apart from the systematic errors introduced by the averaged density and advection velocity , the burning zone is not strictly represented by the zero level set . actually , there is a mixed phase between the regions containing pure ash and fuel , respectively .",
    "the width of the diffusive smearing of the flame is typically a few cells , which is still less than for the reaction - diffusion method .",
    "it was demonstrated by numerous applications in simple test problems as well as large - scale simulations of thermonuclear supernovae that the passive implementation gives a satisfactory representation of the flame fronts at high density and is robust even in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we used the passive implementation for the simulations presented in this article .      on length scales larger than the gibson length @xmath14",
    ", flames are predominantly shaped by turbulence .",
    "if @xmath14 is significantly smaller than the numerical resolution @xmath72 , the computed flame front appears inevitably smoother than its physical counterpart .",
    "consequently , the predicted burning rate would be underestimated , if just the laminar burning speed was substituted for the intrinsic propagation speed @xmath60 in equation  ( [ eq : lset ] ) .",
    "this is where the notion of the turbulent flame speed comes in .",
    "we propose that @xmath73 is given by the local magnitude of unresolved turbulence velocity fluctuations @xmath74 @xcite , albeit the turbulent flame speed , in a strict sense , is an ensemble average .",
    "since the propagation speed can not be less than the laminar flame speed , the simplest relation with correct asymptotic behaviour is @xmath75 the quantity @xmath76 is the subgrid scale turbulence energy and @xmath77 the corresponding speed .",
    "an exact definition will be given in next section .",
    "for brevity , it is understood that @xmath1 denotes the turbulent flame speed at the numerical cutoff @xmath72 in the following .    for @xmath78",
    ", we have the asymptotic relation @xmath79 in the limit of fully developed turbulence .",
    "consequently , the turbulent flame speed becomes independent of the laminar flame speed , and the parameter @xmath80 determines the asymptotic scaling of the turbulent flame speed .",
    "however , it is not quite clear whether the constant of proportionality in the relation between @xmath73 and @xmath81 is just unity or a different value .",
    "empirically , it appears that @xmath82 , where @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath84 in agreement with a constant of proportionality close to unity .",
    "another shortcoming of the maximum relation  ( [ eq : sgs_flame_speed_max ] ) is that it gives a good approximation to the turbulent flame speed in the laminar and the fully turbulent regime , respectively , but not for the transition in between .",
    "if @xmath85 , the relation between turbulent flame speed and turbulence velocity might very well be different .",
    "for example , i m _ et al .",
    "_ mention a quadratic dependence on the turbulence velocity in the case of weak turbulence @xcite . on the other hand , rpke _ et al .",
    "_ report a linear relation even for turbulence velocities which are only marginally larger than the laminar flame speed in two - dimensional numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "however , this result is possibly unsubstantial for the three - dimensional case .",
    "apart from that , the transition from laminar to turbulent burning progresses rather quickly , and a correct description in the intermediate phase is therefore not overly important .",
    "a different turbulent flame speed model was motivated theoretically by pocheau @xcite : @xmath86^{1/n}.\\ ] ] in the scale - invariant regime , with @xmath87 , the asymptotic form @xmath88 is obtained .",
    "et al . _ , chose @xmath89 and @xmath90 for les of gas turbine combustor flows @xcite .",
    "this value was inferred from several laboratory experiments with hydrocarbon / air flames .",
    "however , the data points cover values of the turbulent flame speed of the same order as magnitude as the laminar burning speed only . for this reason",
    ", one must be careful with any extrapolation to the fully turbulent regime , in which @xmath91 .",
    "if @xmath92 , taylor series expansion of the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : sgs_flame_speed_pocheau ] ) yields the _ calvin - williams _ relation , @xmath93 which is consistent with the numerical results of i m _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "apart from calculating the turbulent flame speed , secondary sgs effects can be included in the dynamical equation  ( [ eq : lset ] ) for the level set function @xcite .",
    "this was indeed numerically investigated by i m _ et al .",
    "in particular , they suggested a procedure for the computation of @xmath94 in the fashion of the localised closure for the production parameter @xmath95 , which will be discussed in section  [ sc : sgs_locl ] . whether this is advisable in combination with the passive implementation , where numerical artifacts in the shape of the resolved level set might produce significant spurious contributions , is questionable .",
    "for this reason , it has not been attempted .",
    "in addition , there is a sgs transport term for the level set , which is of the form @xmath96 and effectively introduces _ diffusion _ of the level set due to sgs turbulence .",
    "however , kim _ et al .",
    "_ argued that the contributions arising thereof are not particularly important and , in fact , can not be determined within the available framework of sgs modelling @xcite .",
    "for the determination of the turbulent flame speed according to equation  ( [ eq : sgs_flame_speed_max ] ) or  ( [ eq : sgs_flame_speed_pocheau ] ) , the kinetic energy @xmath0 of unresolved vortices has to be computed .",
    "a dynamical equation for @xmath0 is obtained through decomposition of the conservation law for kinetic energy .",
    "the procedure of decomposing is conceptually based on the notion of filtered quantities . in general , a filter is a convolution operator , which smoothes out fluctuations on spatial scales smaller than the characteristic length of the filter . if a certain numerical solution of the hydrodynamical equations is computed by means of a finite - volume scheme , say , the ppm , then one can associate this solution with the smoothed velocity field @xmath97 , which is obtained by mass - weighted or favre filtering of the exact realisation of the flow : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the smoothed mass density .",
    "the underlying hypothesis is that , if the physical flow @xmath100 were known , there exists a filter @xmath101 with suitable properties such that the favre - filtered velocity field @xmath102 would reproduce the numerically computed velocity field .",
    "corresponding to the smoothed and the fluctuating components of @xmath100 , respectively , one can distinguish the resolved part , @xmath103 , and the subgrid scale part @xmath0 of the specific kinetic energy . in the following",
    ", a formal decomposition of the kinetic energy is devised and the dynamical equation for @xmath0 is formulated .",
    "the non - linearity of the conservation laws necessitates closure relations for several terms in the decomposed equations .",
    "sgs closures and the calculation of associated parameters are discussed in the remainder of this section .      in _ germano s consistent decomposition _",
    ", the sgs turbulence energy is simply defined by the difference between smoothed and resolved kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "this decomposition is equivalent to setting @xmath104 , where the sgs turbulence stress tensor @xmath105 is defined by @xmath106 hence , the sgs turbulence energy is given by @xmath107.\\ ] ] we prefer the germano decomposition , because it yields the conceptually most transparent definition of the sgs turbulence energy and avoids formal difficulties associated with sgs closures .",
    "deviations of the turbulent flame speed in alternative decompositions correspond to higher - order terms which result from secondary filtering of filtered quantities@xcite .",
    "these contributions are likely to be insignificant within the intrinsic inaccuracy of the flame speed model    the sgs turbulence stress tensor @xmath105 enhances the viscous dissipation given by @xmath108 in the equation of motion for the filtered velocity field : @xmath109 here it is assumed that the specific stirring force @xmath110 injects energy on length scales which are large compared to the numerical resolution @xmath72 .",

    "the non - local transport term @xmath120 accounts for the redistribution of turbulence energy by subgrid scale velocity and pressure fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , there are two contributions to the rate of dissipation : @xmath121 is caused by the viscosity of the fluid , while @xmath122 is due to compression effects .",
    "in fact , all of the sgs dynamical terms are _ non - computable _ in terms of resolved quantities .",
    "this is a consequence of the non - linear structure of the hydrodynamical equations , which prohibits complete decomposition . in consequence",

    "we apply the customary turbulent - viscosity hypothesis for the rate of production ( section  10.1 in @xcite ) , the gradient - diffusion hypothesis for turbulent transport ( section  4.3 in @xcite ) and the dimensional closure for the rate of viscous dissipation ( section  13.6.3 in @xcite ) . since pressure effects are small for deflagration in degenerate matter , a rather crude closure for @xmath123 is utilised @xcite .",
    "the final result is the following dynamical equation ( section  3.1.4 in @xcite ) : @xmath124 in particular , an expression analogous to the viscous dissipation term in the navier - stokes equations , @xmath125 is substituted for the anisotropic part of @xmath105 .",

    "these wave numbers , however , are severely affected by numerical dissipation @xcite , and the fluid motion produced by the inverse energy transfer would be rapidly damped out .",

    "the difficulty of determining @xmath142 stems from the fact the rate of dissipation is mostly determined by the fluid dynamics on scales much smaller than the numerical resolution .",
    "therefore , a localised similarity hypothesis is bound to fail .",

    "comparing the left and the middle column of plots in figure  [ fg : stat3d_flame_speed ] , the evolution of the burning process in the simulations which differ only by the coupling of the sgs model to the momentum equation and the treatment of inverse energy transfer appear quite similar .",
    "this can be seen in figures  [ fg : les_nb_energy_evol ] and [ fg : les_energy_evol ] as well , which show contour plots of the total energy per unit mass at different instants of time for both simulations .",
    "however , the burning process proceeds faster in the simulation without backscattering in comparison to the simulation with the fully coupled sgs model . correspondingly , the peak of @xmath234 is delayed in the latter case .    `",
    "les_nb_energy_evol.png `    ` les_nb_q_sgs_evol.png `    the differences in the sgs model are illustrated in figure  [ fg : stat3d_locl ] .",
    "the averages of the production parameter @xmath95 in regions containing , respectively , ash , flames and fuel are plotted in panels ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . if backscattering is included , the mean of @xmath95 within the fuel is initially small . in",
    "the course of turbulence production , the parameter is growing and , eventually , @xmath279 in the statistically stationary regime . on the other hand ,",
    "if backscattering is suppressed , the mean of @xmath95 changes only little in the dominating topological region .",
    "the local values of @xmath95 are fluctuating considerably for @xmath280 .",
    "this can be seen from the strongly oscillating averages of @xmath95 in ash and flames , which initially fill quite narrow spatial regions and encounter varying conditions while being advected by the flow .",
    "the time evolution of the dissipation parameters shown in panels ( c ) and ( d ) , on the other hand , exhibits more or less the same trend . during the first turn - over time",
    ", @xmath142 vanishes identically . at time",
    "@xmath281 , small turbulent vortices begin to form and turbulent dissipation sets in . in statistical equilibrium",
    ", @xmath142 assumes a nearly constant value of about 0.65 for the fully coupled model and 0.75 without backscattering . in the latter case",
    ", a larger dissipation rate compensates the suppressed inverse energy transfer , as one can see from the plots of the mean rate of production and dissipation corresponding to the source terms on the right hand side of equation  ( [ eq : sgs_velocity ] ) in panels ( e ) and ( f ) of figure  [ fg : stat3d_locl ] .",
    "it is obvious that complete coupling significantly reduces the rate of turbulence production .",
    "nevertheless , the mean value of @xmath81 is found to be nearly the same in the statistically stationary regime for both simulations . as mentioned in section  [ sc : sgs_locl ] , we suspect that turbulence production is systematically underestimated by the fully coupled sgs model in combination with the ppm , because the kinetic energy injected through backscattering into modes of high wave number will be quickly dissipated by numerical viscosity .",
    "an impression of the spatiotemporal evolution of @xmath81 is given by the contour plots in figures  [ fg : les_nb_q_sgs_evol ] and [ fg : les_q_sgs_evol ] , respectively .    ` les_energy_evol.png `    ` les_q_sgs_evol.png `    on account of results from laboratory measurements , kim _ et al .",
    "_ argue that pocheau s relation  ( [ eq : sgs_flame_speed_pocheau ] ) with @xmath89 and @xmath282 gives the most accurate prediction of the turbulent flame speed @xcite .",
    "the outcome of running a simulation with the flame speed relation @xmath283 is demonstrated by the statistics in the colum of panels ( c , f , i ) on the very right of figure  [ fg : stat3d_flame_speed ] .",
    "backscattering is also suppressed in this simulation .",
    "now the peak of the burning rate is reached even faster than in the case of the simulation with @xmath262 .",
    "in fact , the bulk of the burning takes place when the level of sgs turbulence is quite low .",
    "accordingly , the plots of contour sections of the specific energy in figure  [ fg : les_nb20_energy_evol ] show that the flame surface is smoother and less corrugated by the flow in the course of the burning process .",
    "the slope of @xmath234 is steepening significantly just for @xmath284 .",
    "this would suggest that @xmath282 is , indeed , a feasible choice . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath84 is favoured by peters @xcite , which yields more or less the same behaviour as in the case @xmath262 . from our current understanding",
    ", we should consider @xmath94 as a parameter of the flame speed model , which is to be chosen within reasonable limits and validated _ a posteriori _ by the results obtained for a particular application .    `",
    "the numerical simulation of thermonuclear deflagration in a box subject to stochastic stirring was utilised as a test problem for the study of flame speed models .",
    "the evolution of the flame front was computed by means of the level set method in the so - called passive implementation .",
    "essentially , an effective flame propagation speed must be calculated , if the gibson scale is small compared to the resolution of the computational grid .",
    "a subgrid scale ( sgs ) model based on the budget of turbulence energy determines a velocity scale which is proportional to the propagation speed of flame fronts in the fully turbulent regime .",
    "some of the closure parameters of the sgs model are locally calculated with dynamical procedures .",
    "thus , we have a semi - localised model .    particularly , we compared two variants of this model . in one case ,",
    "inverse energy transfer from subgrid toward resolved scales was included , in the other case it was suppressed .",
    "inverse energy transfer is also known as backscattering . for a consistent treatment of backscattering ,",
    "complete coupling of the sgs model and the resolved hydrodynamics is indispensable . in combination with the piece - wise parabolic method",
    ", this entails difficulties stemming from the significant numerical viscosity of the scheme .",
    "but we obtained sensible results when suppressing backscattering and applying a simplified sgs model with partial coupling .",
    "depending on the constant of proportionality @xmath80 in the asymptotic flame speed relation , we found the transition from laminar to turbulent burning at noticeably different points in the course of turbulence production .",
    "this transition comes about once the sgs turbulence velocity must exceed the laminar burning speed in a significant volume fraction of the computational domain .",
    "then the nuclear energy generation grows at a much higher rate , and the flame surface develops an intricate structure due to the stretching and folding caused by turbulent vortices . if @xmath94 is about unity , the peak of nuclear energy release appears roughly when the turbulent flow becomes statistically stationary and homogeneous . for larger values of @xmath94 ,",
    "most of the fuel is consumed in advance of turbulence becoming fully developed .",
    "we propose to consider @xmath94 as a control parameter , which regulates the overall rapidness of the burning process .",
    "the semi - localised sgs model presented here is especially suitable for any kind of transient and inhomogeneous turbulent combustion process .",
    "it is the first implementation of this kind of sgs model for an astrophysical application , namely , the numerical simulation of thermonuclear supernovae .",
    "the simulations were run on the hitachi sr-8000 of the _ leibniz computing centre _ the ibm p690 of the _ computing centre of the max - planck - society _ in garching , germany .",
