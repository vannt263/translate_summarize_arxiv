    "nonconservative fields of optical force on optically trapped particles have long been predicted to occur @xcite .",

    "is continuously coupled to particle motion , leading to dissipation and heating even when the particle is localized about a stable point of the force field",
    ".    radiation pressure on trapped particles can be one source of nonconservative forcing . in recent experiments @xcite nonconservative toroidal circulation of optically trapped particles caused by axial radiation pressure",
    "was observed and theoretically analyzed .",
    "recent theoretical work @xcite has shown how , for nonspherical objects , nonconservative motion arises in coordinates of angle and translation .    here",
    "we show that a simple spatial 3d nonconservative force field , circular rather than toroidal , occurs even in the absence of radiation pressure . as a physical model leading to this force",
    ", we describe a sphere trapped by refracting rays . within any such circular - forcing model , and generalizing to an anisotropic trapping force",
    ", we derive the spectrum of motion and the thermal signatures of nonconservative circular forcing .",
    "before narrowing the discussion to optical trapping , we ask what simple generic statements can be made about nonconservative forces .",
    "powerful classification schemes are available from differential geometry @xcite but to use these one must correctly identify forces as fields , not of vectors , but of differential 1-forms .",
    "this means that force components such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 properly take their meaning from the work differential , or work 1-form , @xmath3 which is the integrand for evaluating work along any chosen path .",
    "the 1-form @xmath4 is said to be exact if eq .",
    "( [ forcedef ] ) equals the differential of some potential function , @xmath5 ; otherwise @xmath4 is inexact . for our purposes",
    "an exact 1-form is the same thing as a conservative force .    in euclidean space",

    "but as a 1-form field , eq .  ( [ forcedef ] ) is constrained by darboux s theorem @xcite , which states that every 1-form field @xmath4 can be reduced by some choice of general coordinates ( @xmath6 ) to a shortest canonical form @xmath7 belonging to the sequence @xmath8 in more than three dimensions the list continues with @xmath9 , and so on .    the case @xmath10 , i.e.  @xmath11 , is exact , i.e.  conservative .",

    "it is sufficient to consider a circular pattern of force in some 2d plane containing the equilibrium point .            from another point of view",
