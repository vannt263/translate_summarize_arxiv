    "the motion of particles in disordered environments is important in many contexts , from glass - forming liquids and colloids  @xcite , to biomolecules moving in the crowded environment of the cell  @xcite , to electrical properties of disordered materials  @xcite . in this article",
    ", we discuss subdiffusive propagation in simple one - dimensional models .",
    "while the case of one - dimensional motion may seem simplistic , it is relevant for a variety of model systems : from early studies of electrical transport  @xcite to recently - defined models of glassy behaviour  @xcite , and also to the motion of defects in disordered magnets , to disordered elastic chains and to networks of resistors and capacitors ( see @xcite for reviews ) .    the results that we will present are based around a duality symmetry which relates pairs of discrete one - dimensional models . in a previous study  @xcite , we showed that motion in apparently disparate models can be related exactly , at fixed disorder .",
    "here we generalise those results to a much wider range of hopping models , by treating their master equations in a simple operator formalism .",
    "we also discuss how these results are related to earlier studies of disordered reaction - diffusion systems by schtz and mussawisade  @xcite .",
    "based on the symmetries of the problem , we then introduce a real - space renormalisation scheme in the spirit of that of le doussal , monthus and fisher  @xcite : our scheme is implemented computationally and allows rapid prediction of the propagation in these energy landscapes for fixed disorder , at low computational cost .",
    "the central feature of the renormalisation scheme is that on a given time scale , we have a procedure for decomposing the system into effective trap and barrier regions .",
    "particles within trap regions equilibrate there , while those in barrier regions decay into the effective traps .",
    "the duality symmetry relates trap and barrier regions of pairs of models , and demands that they be treated on an equal footing within the renormalisation scheme . in some sense ,",
    "the renormalisation scheme is connected with the ideas of an energy landscape in these disordered systems  @xcite , but we note that all properties of the energy landscape are here derived directly from the master operator of the stochastic dynamics . in this sense ,",
    "our scheme allows the energy landscape to be derived from the dynamical rules of the system : this is the opposite of the usual situation in which thermodynamic properties are used to infer the routes by which dynamical processes take place .",
    "thus , while our results are clearly restricted to a very simple class of models , it is natural to ask if they might be generalised to higher - dimensional energy landscapes .",
    "the form of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : dual ] we define our models and give the duality relation between their master operators .",
    "the consequences of the duality relation for propagation in these models are discussed in sec .",

    "[ sec : eff ] we explain our effective dynamics scheme ; sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] contains numerical results for specific ensembles of disordered models ; and sec .",
    "[ sec : outlook ] closes with a brief summary and some open questions .",
    "we define a disordered one - dimensional hopping model in terms of rates for hops from site @xmath0 to sites @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which we denote by @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "let @xmath5 be the probability that a particle occupies site @xmath0 at time @xmath6 : the master equation is then @xmath7 for concreteness , we consider a periodic chain of @xmath8 sites , but we are primarily concerned with propagation of particles on infinite chains : that is , we consider the limit of large @xmath8 before any limit of large time . in this limit , propagators will be independent of the choice of boundary conditions .",
    "we also discuss finite chains with reflecting and absorbing boundaries in section  [ sec : bc ] below .",
    "we use an operator notation where the ket @xmath9 represents the state with the particle on site @xmath0 , normalised so that @xmath10",
    ". then , defining the state @xmath11 , the master equation can be written as @xmath12 with @xmath13 \\langle i| \\label{equ : wt1 } \\\\    & = & \\sum_{i=1}^{n }       \\big ( |i+1\\rangle - |i\\rangle \\big ) \\big ( r_i\\langle i| -   \\ell_{i+1}\\langle i+1| \\big ) .",
    "\\label{equ : wt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this section , and wherever we consider systems with periodic boundaries , site @xmath14 is equivalent to site @xmath15 and site @xmath16 is equivalent to site @xmath8 .",
    "this allows terms to be rearranged as e.g.  in going from ( [ equ : wt1 ] ) to ( [ equ : wt ] ) above .",
    "we initially focus on an important special case : we assume that all rates are finite and that @xmath17 .",
    "this ensures that all currents vanish in the long - time limit of the system . under this assumption , we associate an energy with each site , measured _ downwards _ from an arbitrary baseline and determined through @xmath18 .",
    "then , the model respects detailed balance with respect to the distribution @xmath19 , where the sum runs over all sites . with this sign convention",
    ", a site with large positive @xmath20 has a large gibbs weight .",
    "the reason for this choice will become clear below .     by transition state energies",
    "@xmath21 . the rate for hopping from a site is related to the sum of the site energy ( measured downwards as shown ) and the adjacent transition state energy ( measured upwards ) .",
    "( bottom ) on inversion of the potential , the transition state energies become energies of new sites with half - integer indices .",
    "transition rates between these sites are controlled by the energies @xmath20 which now have an interpretation as transition state energies .",
    ", width=226 ]    we now discuss general duality relations between pairs of hopping models . to this end ,",
    "we re - parameterise the transition rates @xmath3 and @xmath4 by defining transition state energies @xmath21 associated with the links between sites : @xmath22 note that site energies @xmath20 and transition state energies @xmath21 are measured with respect to separate arbitrary baselines , so they do not necessarily have to be positive ; but an interpretation in terms of activated hopping processes becomes problematic unless @xmath23 .",
    "two subclasses of these general hopping models have been studied quite extensively in the past  @xcite .",
    "the first subclass is the ( pure ) trap model , which is the case @xmath24 for all @xmath0 , with the @xmath20 being independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) ; the second is the ( pure ) barrier model , which has @xmath25 for all @xmath0 , with the @xmath21 being i.i.d . a duality between pure trap and pure barrier models was discussed in  @xcite , which we now generalise .",
    "the duality relation involves an inversion of the potential , which swaps the meaning of transition state energies and site energies : the various definitions are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : invert_all ] . to present this relation ,",
    "we define an alternative representation of the general hopping model , in which sites have indices @xmath26 ( throughout this article , @xmath0 is always an integer ) .",
    "the hopping rate from @xmath27 to @xmath26 is @xmath28 and the rate for the reverse process is @xmath29 .",
    "the master equation for this process has a similar representation in terms of state vectors @xmath30 , with a master operator @xmath31    if we choose @xmath32 and @xmath33 , then @xmath34 describes the same model as @xmath35 , up to a simple relabelling of sites ( site @xmath0 in @xmath35 is mapped to site @xmath27 in @xmath34 ) . to describe instead the inverted potential of fig .",
    "[ fig : invert_all ] , we choose @xmath36    with these definitions , the duality relation takes a simple form : we define operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 hence , by combining the first expression ( [ eq : s1st ] ) for @xmath39 with the second expression ( [ eq : sbar2nd ] ) for @xmath40 , and _ vice versa _",
    ", one verifies that @xmath41 it follows that @xmath42 and that @xmath43 these two relations express the key duality between the two master operators from which all our other results are derived .",
    "they imply , for example , that @xmath35 and @xmath34 have the same spectrum of eigenvalues : if @xmath44 is a right eigenvector of @xmath34 then @xmath45 is a right eigenvector of @xmath35 with the same eigenvalue .",
    "the exception is the singular case where @xmath46 , which can happen only when the eigenvalue is zero .",
    "an analogous argument can be made in the other direction , showing overall that the nonzero eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors of @xmath35 and @xmath34 are in one - to - one correspondence with each other .",
    "in fact , the structure of ( [ equ : susy ] ) occurs in the context of supersymmetric field theories ( for a discussion of supersymmetry in the language of operators , applied to energy landscapes , see  @xcite ; for a more general introduction , see  @xcite ) .",
    "these hopping models are very simple examples of supersymmetric partners : the spaces @xmath47 and @xmath48 can be interpreted as zero- and one - fermion subspaces of a generalised superspace .",
    "acting to the right , the operator @xmath39 annihilates all elements of @xmath49 and @xmath40 annihilates all elements of @xmath50 so @xmath51 : these operators are the supercharges of the theory . we can then write @xmath52 which allows us to identify the two models as supersymmetric partners .",
    "it is also instructive to consider the continuum limit of our lattice model .",
    "assume that the lattice spacing is @xmath53 , so that the position of site @xmath0 is @xmath54 .",
    "we define continuous functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 and take @xmath57 and @xmath58 . within the continuum limit",
    ", we represent the superspace explicitly , using a basis @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the position and @xmath61 distinguishes the zero- and one - fermion subspaces .",
    "that is , taking fermionic operators @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 , we take @xmath65 and @xmath66 . to make contact with the basis used for the lattice model , we identify @xmath9 with @xmath67 and @xmath30 with @xmath68 . if we then divide @xmath39 and @xmath40 by @xmath69 and take the lattice spacing to zero , we arrive at @xmath70 the master ( or fokker - planck ) operators follow as @xmath71 this makes it obvious that the duality just swaps the trap and barrier parts of the potential , i.e.  inverts the energy landscape . in the case without thermal activation , which corresponds to @xmath72 , the duality reduces to the standard one for diffusion in the potentials @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "one part of this duality was used recently in  @xcite to map boundary - driven steady states with current to current - free equilibrium states .",
    "briefly , if @xmath75 is a steady state probability distribution of @xmath35 in the presence of a boundary field so that @xmath76 , then @xmath77 obeys @xmath78 .",
    "thus , @xmath79 is a steady state of @xmath34 , but the current in this state is @xmath80 .",
    "the same approach also works on the lattice , and indeed the rate transformation ( 182 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite is the same as our ( [ equ : lrlr ] ) .",
    "the total master operator combining the dynamics in the zero and one - fermion spaces can be made hermitian by a standard similarity transformation : with @xmath81 one has @xmath82 using @xmath83 to extract the extra contribution from the one - fermion subspace , one can simplify this to @xmath84\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the ` standard ' case with uniform diffusion constant @xmath72 , the one - fermion term simplifies to @xmath85 and this is exactly the term that was used e.g.  in  @xcite to construct dynamics that ( in one dimension , and in the one - fermion subspace ) converges to maxima rather than minima of the potential .      in the previous section",
    ", we discussed systems with detailed balance and periodic boundaries .",
    "we now discuss how the duality relation applies on finite chains with reflecting or absorbing boundaries .",
    "we note in passing that some of these relations may be generalised both to boundary - driven models and to those with a finite bias acting in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "however , for this work , we restrict ourselves to models without a steady - state current .    in the case of periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "the derivation of our duality relations required that the rates satisfy the global constraint @xmath17 , in order to guarantee detailed balance .",
    "an alternative that avoids this constraint is to use finite chains with reflecting or absorbing boundary conditions . these can be obtained by allowing zero rates in the periodic system . for a system with reflecting boundaries",
    ", we take @xmath86 in @xmath35 . in the notation of energies , we set formally @xmath87 : sites @xmath15 and @xmath8 are then reflecting boundaries because they are separated by an infinite barrier .",
    "this has no effect on the equilibrium steady state , which now satisfies detailed balance whatever our choice for the remaining nonzero rates .",
    "the duality transformation carries through as before , resulting in a system with @xmath88 . in this system",
    "there are no transitions out of site @xmath89 , which is therefore absorbing .",
    "the duality thus relates models with reflecting and absorbing boundaries , and as before these models share the same eigenvalues and their eigenvectors ( for nonzero eigenvalues ) are related through the operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "note that for @xmath34 , the steady state that is reached in the long - time limit has the particle fully localised on the absorbing site @xmath89 .",
    "detailed balance still holds , with e.g. the propagators obeying  ( [ equ : detbal ] ) below ; the balance of transitions in the steady state is trivial because there are no transitions taking place at all .",
    "one can go further by distinguishing whether the absorbing site in @xmath34 is reached from the left ( from site @xmath90 ) or from the right ( from site @xmath91 ) , and accordingly split the absorbing site into two sites @xmath89 and @xmath92 .",
    "the duality relation to the system @xmath35 with two reflecting boundaries then holds as before .",
    "the only difference is that , because the system now has two absorbing sites , the master operator has two zero eigenvalues .",
    "the two corresponding right eigenvectors are localised on the absorbing sites , while the elements of the left eigenvectors give the probabilities that a particle initially on a given site will end up on either one of the absorbing sites ( this will be discussed further in later sections ) .",
    "finally , one may also take an operator @xmath35 with one reflecting boundary and an absorbing site at the other boundary : this can be done by setting @xmath87 and @xmath93 , so that @xmath94 . in the dual model of this system ,",
    "@xmath95 , so that the reflecting boundary at site 1 maps to an absorbing boundary at site @xmath89 and _ vice versa _ for sites @xmath8 and @xmath91 .",
    "so far , our results apply to models in which the steady state has zero current ( that is , periodic chains with global detailed balance , and chains with reflecting or absorbing boundaries ) .",
    "however , there is a slightly modified duality relation that holds even for periodic chains without detailed balance , where the steady state has finite current . instead of factorising @xmath96 as in ( [ equ : susy ] ) ,",
    "one may instead write @xmath97 with @xmath98 and @xmath99 . [ in the continuum limit , one has @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the probability current operator , so the master ( fokker - planck ) equation has the form @xmath102 as usual , where @xmath103 is the probability current , which is linear in @xmath104 .    with these definitions",
    ", one may verify that @xmath105 or equivalently that @xmath106 if detailed balance holds , the relation @xmath107 may be combined with ( [ equ : jddag ] ) to recover ( [ equ : dual_s ] ) .",
    "( one way is to define @xmath108 and to note that @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and by detailed balance @xmath111 . )",
    "we also note that the operator @xmath112 may not be inverted , since @xmath113 .",
    "if one considers for example a periodic chain of @xmath8 sites with an absorbing site 1 and a reflecting barrier @xmath89 , so that @xmath114 , then one may write @xmath115 and @xmath116 with @xmath117 . in that case",
    ", it may be verified that the inverse of @xmath118 does exist , and the duality transformation becomes @xmath119    we note that the transformation operators @xmath112 and @xmath118 do not depend on the disordered rates @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "an invertible transformation that is independent of disorder was used by schtz and mussawisade  @xcite to study a reaction - diffusion model in a similar disordered environment . the duality transformation ( enantiodromy )",
    "@xmath120 used in  @xcite is related to the transformation @xmath118 , and can be used to prove some of the relations for propagators that we discuss in the next section .",
    "however , analysis of the reaction - diffusion model is much more complex than the single particle system considered here . in the following ,",
    "we restrict our analysis to the single - particle case , explaining which results may be obtained by alternative means .",
    "we now consider the propagators of these hopping models . for convenience ,",
    "we first consider periodic boundaries in the case where detailed balance holds .",
    "generalisations to reflecting / absorbing boundaries are straightforward using the approach discussed above ( sec .",
    "[ sec : bc ] ) . for the model @xmath35",
    ", we define the propagator @xmath121 as the probability that the particle is on site @xmath122 , given that it was on site @xmath123 a time @xmath6 earlier : @xmath124 similarly , for the model @xmath34 , we define @xmath125    detailed balance holds for both models so we have , bearing in mind our sign convention for energies , @xmath126 or @xmath127 with a similar relation for @xmath128 .",
    "we now appeal to the duality relation @xmath129 to obtain @xmath130 . using the explicit form of @xmath40 , we arrive at @xmath131 { \\mathrm{e}}^{-e_m } , \\label{equ : gsbar}\\ ] ] from which detailed balance for @xmath35 implies @xmath132 this result generalises eq .",
    "( 5 ) of ref .",
    "equation  ( [ equ : dual_prop ] ) may also be proved directly using the relation  ( [ equ : dual_d ] ) .",
    "hence , this relation between propagators applies on periodic chains , regardless of whether detailed balance holds .",
    "it holds for all times , including cases where the limit of large time is taken at fixed system size .",
    "two comments are in order here .",
    "firstly , a relation similar to  ( [ equ : dual_prop ] ) was proven for propagators in the reaction - diffusion model of  @xcite .",
    "that model has pair annihilation , so we consider an initial state with two well - separated particles .",
    "if one then takes the limit @xmath133 at fixed time , one arrives at two independently propagating particles which can be shown to satisfy  ( [ equ : dual_prop ] ) .",
    "however , the mapping of  @xcite can not be used to prove ( [ equ : dual_prop ] ) for large times and periodic chains of fixed length : in that case , it would be natural to use an initial state with exactly one particle but the mapping then breaks down ( except for specific cases where the periodic chain is broken into segments by absorbing sites and reflecting barriers ) . secondly , for the specific case where the @xmath20 are chosen freely but @xmath24 for all @xmath0 , the relation  ( [ equ : dual_prop ] ) was given in ref .",
    "@xcite , but it is also implicit in  ref .",
    "( in the notation there , it reads @xmath134 and can be derived by inserting eqs .",
    "( 2.15 ) and ( 2.16 ) into ( 2.19 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite and expanding appropriately . )    the equality  ( [ equ : dual_prop ] ) relates differences with respect to the initial site of propagators in the two hopping models .",
    "if the propagator for one model is known , the other can be calculated by successive application of this equation .",
    "an illustration of this relation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dual_illust ] .",
    "we also note that ( [ equ : dual_prop ] ) is symmetric between the two master operators : any set of transition rates can be interpreted either as a model of type @xmath35 or as a model of type @xmath34 . to reinforce this symmetry",
    ", we note that the relation @xmath135 implies that @xmath136 { \\mathrm{e}}^{-e_{m-{\\frac12 } } } \\label{equ : gs}\\ ] ] which is the same relation as ( [ equ : gsbar ] ) , but with the original model @xmath35 expressed in the form @xmath34 and _ vice versa_.    the simple form of ( [ equ : dual_prop ] ) means that we can take the disorder average .",
    "as long as the disorder is translationally invariant , e.g.  if the transition state energies @xmath137 and site energies @xmath138 are taken from two ( possibly different ) translationally invariant distributions , the disorder - averaged propagators @xmath139 will depend only on @xmath140 .",
    "defining then @xmath141 , the relation ( [ equ : dual_prop ] ) becomes @xmath142 .",
    "thus , @xmath143 is a constant ; but @xmath144 and similarly for @xmath145 , so @xmath146 and the constant has to vanish .",
    "one concludes that @xmath147 .",
    "re - instating the notation with separate initial and finite site labels , we have @xmath148 where the last equality follows from left - right symmetry . remarkably , then , the disorder - averaged propagators of the dual models are equal on all scales of length and time . again , this generalises our earlier statement  @xcite relating average propagators in pure trap and barrier models .",
    "a similar result applies for disorder distributions which break left - right symmetry , as long as they remain translationally invariant .",
    "take for example a model described by @xmath35 with site and barrier energies from a translationally invariant distribution , and then modify the rates according to a site - independent prescription , so that the left - going and right - going rates acquire different distributions . with periodic boundary conditions",
    ", translation invariance again holds and we obtain by the same arguments as above @xmath149 with both sides again depending only on the difference @xmath140 .",
    "the same result applies on long chains with reflecting boundaries , as long as we are far away from these boundaries so that translation invariance is not broken .",
    "several effective dynamics and renormalisation schemes have been proposed to approximate propagators for motion in random potentials  @xcite .",
    "the most notable success in this area is the work of le doussal , monthus and fisher  @xcite , which we refer to as dmf .",
    "they considered the sinai model  @xcite , in which the @xmath4 and @xmath3 are independently and identically distributed , so that the site energies @xmath20 follow a random walk in real space . for long time scales in that model , dmf found a renormalisation group ( rg ) scheme that can be implemented analytically and gives exact results for a variety of observables .    later , monthus  @xcite applied a related scheme to the pure trap model , in which @xmath150 and these rates are independently and identically distributed with a power - law distribution @xmath151 .",
    "we refer to this scheme as mon03 : it can be treated analytically and its predictions are exact in the limit of large @xmath152 ( our notation follows that of @xcite : to arrive at the notation of  @xcite , replace @xmath152 by @xmath153 ) .",
    "more recently , monthus and garel ( mg ) derived a general rg scheme  @xcite that is not restricted to one dimension nor to single - particle systems . like the schemes of refs .",
    "@xcite , the mg scheme is effective when disorder is the dominant source of fluctuations .",
    "finally , we recently  @xcite introduced a modified scheme for pure trap and barrier models that respects the duality symmetry  ( [ equ : dual_prop ] ) but requires a computational implementation .",
    "this prescription accounts for effects that were neglected in previous schemes , and reduces to the mon03 scheme in the limits in which that method is exact .    here , we generalise the scheme of  @xcite to general disordered potentials ( in one dimension ) .",
    "we arrive at a method that encompasses the dmf and mon03 methods in the limits when they are exact , and is also consistent with the duality relation  ( [ equ : dual_prop ] ) .",
    "our method also shares features with that of mg , but it respects the duality symmetries discussed above , while the mg scheme does not .",
    "we describe the application of this scheme to models parameterised in the form of @xmath35 , with site energies @xmath20 and transition state energies @xmath21 . for notational convenience ,",
    "we simply denote these master operators by @xmath154 from now on .",
    "the idea of the effective dynamics scheme is to describe motion on long time scales in terms of a coarse - grained set of co - ordinates in which the system evolves slowly .",
    "we have developed two versions of the scheme : in the main text we describe the more physical and intuitive version that also gives the most accurate description of motion in the system . we discuss the justifications of our scheme in later sections ( [ app : eff ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] ) : in particular , the second version of the scheme can be justified more formally , and it gives similar results , but with larger errors for finite @xmath152 .",
    "the scheme is parameterised by a time scale @xmath155 . on that time scale",
    ", we partition the 1d chain into effective trap and effective barrier regions . the coarse - grained slow co - ordinates are the occupancies of the effective traps : @xmath156 we continue to use roman indices @xmath157 for the original site labels of the model , while greek indices @xmath158 label the slow co - ordinates .",
    "thus , @xmath159 and @xmath160 are the leftmost and rightmost sites within effective trap @xmath161 .",
    "the traps form an ordered set along the chain , so we have @xmath162 .",
    "we refer to the regions between these effective traps as effective barriers .    for a given value of @xmath163 , the effective dynamics scheme gives ( i ) an approximation for the propagator @xmath164 and ( ii ) an approximate equation of motion for the slow co - ordinates , valid for times @xmath165 .",
    "in addition , the scheme specifies ( iii ) how the set of effective traps evolves as @xmath163 is decreased towards zero .",
    "physically , the idea is that motion within effective traps is fast , while motion between traps is slow .",
    "assuming equilibration within effective traps , we have for sites within an effective trap region , @xmath166 where we identify the free energy of effective trap @xmath161 : @xmath167 if site @xmath0 is between traps @xmath168 and @xmath161 , that is @xmath169 , then it may relax into either trap before equilibrating there , and we have @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the probability that a particle initially on a site @xmath0 between traps @xmath168 and @xmath161 relaxes first into trap @xmath161 .",
    "these probabilities can be obtained by considering propagation on a chain with absorbing sites @xmath172 and @xmath159 , and calculating the probability of absorption into each of these sites for a given initial site @xmath0 .",
    "the result is @xmath173 with @xmath174 this completes point ( i ) above .",
    "turning to point ( ii ) , the equations of motion for the slow degrees of freedom are @xmath175 with @xmath176 that is , hopping takes place only between nearest neighbours , and the rates are given by the free energies of the effective traps @xmath177 and ` transition state free energies ' @xmath178 .",
    "it remains to discuss point ( iii ) above : how the set of effective traps depends on the time scale @xmath163 .",
    "initially each effective trap contains a single site @xmath0 , and each effective barrier a single transition site @xmath26 .",
    "each stage of our effective dynamics begins by calculating rates for motion from trap @xmath161 : we calculate a renormalised rate @xmath179 associated with the rate @xmath180 , i.e.  with leaving the trap to the right : @xmath181 and similarly for motion to the left @xmath182 notice that @xmath179 is symmetric in @xmath183 and @xmath184 . in a ( renormalised ) landscape similar to that for pure traps",
    ", @xmath183 would be comparable to @xmath180 and so @xmath185 if the other rate ( @xmath184 ) is small .",

    "several cases arise , which are illustrated in the following section , with reference to the example landscape in fig .",
    "[ fig : rg_new ] . here",
    "we give the rules : supposing that the largest rate is @xmath179 , we now remove trap @xmath161 .",

    "it is useful to compare this scheme with the effective dynamics of dmf  @xcite . in that scheme ,",
    "the slow degrees of freedom @xmath248 are simply a subset of the original site occupancies @xmath5 , so each effective trap contains exactly one site : @xmath249 for all @xmath161 .",

    "further , in the dmf scheme , all elements of the approximate propagator are zero or unity : for times of order @xmath257 , the non - zero elements of the approximate @xmath258 for @xmath259 are @xmath260 which can be compared with ( [ equ : rg_int_g ] )",

    "that is the condition in which the dmf scheme is exact , and we conclude that our scheme is also exact in that limit . in fact , our scheme is also exact in the less - restricted limit of well - separated rates given in ( [ equ : eg_rates ] ) , while the dmf method is inaccurate in that case .",
    "the clearest differences between the schemes occur in the propagators .",
    "for example , compring ( [ equ : rg_int_g ] ) with ( [ equ : rg_int_g_dmf ] ) , the dmf scheme ignores the possibility that a particle originally on site @xmath15 may relax onto site @xmath16 at this stage , while such transitions happen with probability approaching @xmath89 if @xmath268 .",
    "additionally , under the same condition @xmath268 , the transition rates @xmath228 and @xmath229 differ between the schemes by a factor close to 2 .",
    "compared to dmf , these rates are smaller in our new scheme , reflecting the possibility that a particle that hops from site @xmath16 to site @xmath15 may return to site @xmath16 before visiting site @xmath218 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , factors such as these must be included in effective dynamics schemes in order to obtain the correct scaling behaviour for models where many of the @xmath21 are approximately equal .",
    "we also compare the scheme given here with that of mg  @xcite .",
    "that scheme states the slow co - ordinates at each stage and their equations of motion , although the explicit propagator @xmath269 among the original sites of the model is not given .",
    "in fact , for one - dimensional hopping models , the ` full ' mg scheme reduces to a simplified version of our scheme , in which effective traps are always simply removed from the list of slow degrees of freedom , but traps are never merged . in the language of sec .",
    "[ sec : rg ] , one always assumes that the landscape has a ` pure trap ' character . in choosing which traps to remove , one takes the parameters @xmath270 , consistent with that assumption .",
    "one may verify that this procedure is exact and coincides with our scheme in the limit where all site energies @xmath20 are well - separated from each other : it is therefore appropriate for systems such as pure trap models .",
    "however , the scheme does not preserve the duality of sec .",
    "[ sec : dual ] : in particular , while it is appropriate for pure trap models , it fails for their duals , which are pure barrier models .",
    "the effective dynamics scheme can be interpreted as a projection of the master operator @xmath154 onto its slow degrees of freedom .",
    "briefly , any master operator can be diagonalised as @xmath271 and its propagator written as @xmath272 .",
    "time scales are ( globally ) well - separated if there is a time @xmath6 such that all of the exponential factors are either negligibly small or close to unity . for times",
    "@xmath6 with that property , the time evolution operator is well - approximated by a projection operator @xmath273 which can be rearranged into the form @xmath274 where the states @xmath275 and @xmath276 have non - negative elements  @xcite .",
    "for the specific case of hopping models , the states @xmath275 indicate the effective traps into which the system relaxes on the time scale @xmath6 , while the vectors @xmath276 indicate the probabilities of relaxing into these states .    for the effective dynamics ,",
    "the key point is that motion on time scales longer than @xmath277 can be well - described by a renormalised master operator @xmath278 , since eigenmodes with @xmath279 that are irrelevant at time @xmath6 are also irrelevant for all longer times [ more precisely , @xmath280 and the error becomes small for @xmath281 . in the effective dynamics",
    "a set of effective trap and barrier regions corresponds to an operator @xmath282 that approximates @xmath283 .",
    "we therefore define the renormalised master operator @xmath284 and we note that a corresponding approximation for the propagator is @xmath285    for consistency with ( [ equ : master_slow ] ) above , the renormalised master operator should take the form @xmath286 where @xmath287 and @xmath288 are vectors associated with trap @xmath161 .",
    "thus , the effective dynamics represent a renormalisation scheme in the sense that the operator @xmath289 maintains the same form as the original master operator  ( [ equ : wt ] ) as the cutoff @xmath163 is reduced .",
    "to obtain such a form for @xmath289 , we take @xmath290 where the @xmath287 and @xmath288 are approximations to slow eigenvectors of @xmath154 .",
    "our scheme as given by equs .",
    "( [ equ : p_slow]-[equ : rla ] ) corresponds to the choice @xmath291 and @xmath292 in [ app : eff ] , we show that the @xmath287 and @xmath288 constructed in this way are indeed good approximations to slow eigenvectors of @xmath154 , under conditions discussed below .",
    "thus , the effective equation of motion ( [ equ : master_slow ] ) corresponds in operator notation to the equation @xmath293 and the approximate propagator of ( [ equ : prop_p1],[equ : prop_p2 ] ) corresponds to @xmath294 .",
    "the quality of these approximations depends on two considerations .",
    "firstly , the validity of the effective equation of motion ( [ equ : master_slow ] ) depends on the extent to which the projection operator @xmath295 approximates @xmath296 .",
    "then , the extent to which the propagator @xmath164 coincides with @xmath297 depends in addition on a separation of time scales , as can be seen from the discussion of ( [ equ : pex ] ) .    we observe that if @xmath298 at all stages in the scheme then the errors associated with the effective dynamics remain small as @xmath163 is reduced , while large errors arise if @xmath295 becomes different from @xmath296 .",
    "the conditions under which the operator @xmath282 represents a good approximation to @xmath283 are discussed in  [ app : eff ] .",
    "some numerical tests are also given in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] .",
    "we summarise here the analytic results of  [ app : eff ] : on long time scales ( small @xmath163 ) we identify the ` fastest relevant rates ' @xmath183 and @xmath180 which are comparable to @xmath163 . for a consistent renormalisation flow , we require that these fast relevant rates are typically much larger than all other relevant rates in their neighbourhood , except that ( i ) fast relevant rates @xmath180 may be comparable either to @xmath183 or to @xmath184 , and ( ii ) fast relevant rates @xmath183 may be comparable either to @xmath180 or to @xmath299 .",
    "( the condition of globally well - separated time scales described above is not required : it is sufficient that eigenvalues for motion in the same spatial neighbourhood should be well - separated . )      to conclude this section , we discuss duality relations for the effective dynamics , restoring superscripts to distinguish between @xmath35 and @xmath34 . if we renormalise an operator @xmath96 according to our scheme , we arrive at a renormalised model that can be written in the form @xmath300 .",
    "the operators @xmath301 and @xmath302 have the same form as @xmath39 and @xmath40 , except that sites @xmath0 are replaced by effective traps @xmath161 , transition states by effective barriers , and energies by free energies .",
    "an important property of our rg procedure is that if we apply it to the dual master operator @xmath303 , we find that this renormalises precisely to @xmath304 .",
    "thus , in addition to the basic requirement that @xmath305 takes the same form as @xmath154 , our scheme also obeys the general duality relation under landscape inversion .",
    "this is of course desirable , as renormalisation schemes should respect all symmetries of the models of interest .    in the illustrations of figs .",

    "[ fig : invert_all ] leads to the same renormalisation flows that would be obtained by starting with the dual of the original model .",

    "thus , supposing that we combine traps @xmath161 and @xmath189 in an rg step on the model @xmath35 , we also remove barrier @xmath191 . in the dual model @xmath34 ,",
    "we remove the trap with index @xmath191 , which corresponds to combining the barrier regions @xmath161 and @xmath189 .",
    "finally , it can be verified that be verified that the rules for merging and removing traps do preserve the duality between @xmath306 and @xmath307 .",
    "a brief comment is in order on the construction of @xmath301 and @xmath315 . from @xmath316 and @xmath317",
    "one might naively identify @xmath318 , @xmath319 ; but this choice does not satisfy the duality requirement that @xmath320 . a little thought shows that one requires instead @xmath321 and @xmath322 . here",

    "we note finally that not only the master operators but also the propagators produced by our rg scheme obey the required duality : the propagators are the matrix elements of the projectors @xmath326 and @xmath327 , and one verifies by direct calculation that @xmath328 in accordance with the general duality relation ( [ equ : dual_prop ] ) .",
    "the renormalisation scheme that we have discussed can be implemented computationally without undue difficulty .",

    "<S> we identify a duality transformation in one - dimensional hopping models that relates propagators in general disordered potentials linked by an up - down inversion of the energy landscape . </S>",
    "<S> this significantly generalises previous results for a duality between trap and barrier models . </S>",
    "<S> we use the resulting insights into the symmetries of these models to develop a real - space renormalisation scheme that can be implemented computationally and allows rather accurate prediction of propagation in these models . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the relation of this renormalisation scheme to earlier analytical treatments . </S>"
