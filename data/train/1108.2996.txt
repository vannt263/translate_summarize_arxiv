    "group testing is a combinatorial scheme developed for the purpose of efficient identification of infected individuals in a given pool of subjects  @xcite . the main idea behind",
    "the approach is that if a small number of individuals are infected , one can test the population in groups , rather than individually , thereby saving in terms of the number of tests conducted .",
    "a tested group is said to be positive if at least one of its members tests positive ; otherwise , the tested group is said to be negative .",
    "each individual from a population of size @xmath0 is represented by a binary test vector ( or signature ) of length @xmath1 , indicating in which of the @xmath1 tests the individual participates .",
    "the test outcomes are represented by a vector of size @xmath1 that equals the entry - wise boolean or function of the signatures of infected individuals .",
    "the reconstruction task consists of identifying the infected individuals based on their test signatures , using the smallest signature length @xmath1 .",
    "the work in  @xcite was extended in  @xcite , where the authors proposed two coding schemes for use in information retrieval systems and for channel assignments aimed at relieving congestion in crowded communications bands .",
    "the coding schemes are now known as superimposed codes , including _",
    "disjunct / zero - false - drop _ ( d / zfd ) and _ separable / uniquely decipherable _ ( s / ud ) codes . for compactness , we henceforth only use the terms disjunct ( d ) and separable ( s ) to describe such codes .",
    "these two classes of superimposed codes were extensively studied ",
    "see  @xcite-@xcite and references therein .",
    "superimposed codes are inherently asymmetric with respect to the elements of the input alphabet : if all tested subjects are negative ( i.e. , zero ) , the output is negative .",
    "otherwise , for any positive number of infected test subjects , the output is positive .",
    "consequently , a zero output carries significantly more information than an output equal to one . for many applications , including dna pooling and other genomic and biological testing methods with low sensitivity",
    ", a test may be positive only if a sufficiently large number of subjects test positive  @xcite .",
    "in particular , a test outcome may be positive if and only if all subjects are infected .    a probabilistic scheme that makes the group test symmetric with respect to the all - positive and all - negative tests",
    "was first described in  @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "these are the only two papers dealing with  symmetric  group tests , although only within a probabilistic setting where the inputs are assumed to follow a binomial distribution .",
    "in addition , the method was only studied for two extremal parameter choices , using a game - theoretic framework in which the player s strategies ( i.e. , reconstruction methods ) are fixed and involve some form of oracle information .",
    "a more recent approach to the problem of a nearly - symmetric group testing was described in  @xcite .",
    "threshold group testing assumes that a test is positive ( or negative ) if more ( or less ) than @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) individuals tested are positive , where @xmath4 .",
    "a test produces an _ arbitrary _ outcome ( zero or one ) otherwise .",
    "the latter feature makes the testing problem highly nontrivial and substantially different from symmetric group testing ( sgt ) .",
    "we are concerned with describing symmetric group testing in a combinatorial setting , extending the concept of symmetry using information theoretic methods and in developing analogues of @xmath5 and @xmath6 codes , termed @xmath7 and @xmath8 codes .",
    "our results include bounds on the size of the test set of symmetric group testing , construction methods for symmetric @xmath5 and @xmath6 codes , and efficient reconstruction algorithms in the absence and presence of errors .",
    "bounds on the size of @xmath7 and @xmath8 codes are based on lovsz local lemma  @xcite and constructive coding theoretic arguments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : info - theory ] contains a short exposition regarding symmetric group testing , while information - theoretic bounds on the number of required tests are derived in noisy and noise - free scenarios . in section  [ sec : ggt ] , a generalization of sgt ( termed _ generalized group testing _ )",
    "is introduced by employing a lower and upper threshold , and information theoretic bounds on the number of required tests are derived .",
    "section  [ sec : superimposed ] introduces symmetric superimposed codes and contains derivations on the bounds on the size of @xmath7 and @xmath8 codes .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : construction ] presents some techniques for constructing symmetric superimposed codes .",
    "the use of sgt was originally motivated by applications in circuit testing and chemical component analysis  @xcite . as an illustrative example , consider the situation where one is to test @xmath0 identically designed circuits using only serial and parallel component concatenation . in the serial testing mode , one can detect if all circuits are operational . in the parallel mode",
    ", one can detect if all circuits are non - operational .",
    "if at least one circuit is operational and one is non - operational , neither of the two concatenation schemes will be operational .",
    "detecting efficiently which of the circuits are non - operational would require a ternary output group testing scheme .",
    "the reasons for introducing symmetric group testing with ternary outputs are twofold .",
    "the first motivation is to provide symmetry in the information content of the output symbols zero and one .",
    "note that in standard group testing , a zero output automatically eliminates all tested subjects from further consideration , which is not the case with the symbol one .",
    "in symmetric group testing , the symbols zero and one play a symmetric role .",
    "the second motivation comes from biological applications in which the sensitivity of the measurement devices is such that it can only provide a range for the number of infected individuals in a pool : for example , the output may be `` 0 '' if less than @xmath3 individuals in the test set are infected , ",
    "1  if more than @xmath9 individuals are infected , and `` 2 '' in all other cases .    throughout the paper",
    "we use the word `` positive '' ( `` negative '' ) to indicate that a tested subject has ( does not have ) a given property . for the asymmetric testing strategy ,",
    "the outcome of a test is negative if all tested subjects are negative , and positive otherwise .",
    "the outcome of a symmetric test is said to be positive ( denoted by `` 1 '' ) , inconclusive ( denoted by `` 2 '' ) , or negative ( denoted by `` 0 '' ) , if all the subjects tested are positive , at least one subject is positive and another one is negative , and all subjects are negative , respectively .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the total number of test subjects , and let @xmath10 denote the defective set with cardinality @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath12 denote the collection of codewords ( or signatures ) corresponding to @xmath10 ; note that the length of each codeword is equal to @xmath1 .",
    "also , let @xmath13 denote the noise - free observation vector ( test outcome ) equal to the _",
    "ternary addition _ of the codewords of the defective set , where ternary addition is defined as follows .",
    "[ def1 ] for a ternary alphabet @xmath14 , we define _ ternary addition _ , @xmath15 , via the rules @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . clearly , ternary addition is commutative and associative .",
    "note that in general the ternary addition operator is more informative than its binary counterpart ; consequently , one expects that the number of required tests in the sgt is smaller than the number of required tests in a similar asymmetric group testing ( agt ) scheme .",
    "we hence focus on finding upper and lower bounds on the minimum number of tests in a sgt scheme that ensures detection of the defective set with probability of error asymptotically converging to zero .      in the noise - free case ,",
    "the observation vector is equal to the superposition of the signatures of defectives , i.e. , @xmath19 where `` @xmath15 '' denotes ternary addition , and @xmath20 stands for the signature of the @xmath21 defective subject .",
    "let the tests be designed independently , and let @xmath22 denote the probability that a subject is part of a given test , independent of all other subjects .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for any @xmath23 , a sufficient number of tests for asymptotically achieving a probability of error equal to zero in the agt setting is lower bounded as @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes all ordered pairs of sets @xmath26 that partition the defective set , such that @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in the above equation , @xmath29 stands for the mutual information between @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; for a single test , @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 ) is a vector of size @xmath34 , with its @xmath35 entry equal to 1 if the @xmath35 defective subject in @xmath36 is in the test and 0 otherwise , while @xmath37 is the outcome of the test .    also , a necessary condition for zero error probability in agt was shown to be of the form @xcite @xmath38 by following the same steps in the proof of the above two bounds , it can be easily shown that the same sufficient and necessary conditions hold for the sgt scheme , except for the fact that the mutual information will evaluate to a different form given the change in the output alphabet .",
    "furthermore , it can be easily shown that for a fixed value of @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , as @xmath42 ; consequently , these bounds are asymptotically tight .    in the following proposition",
    ", we evaluate the expressions for mutual information in and for sgt .    in the noise - free sgt for @xmath43 , @xmath44 where @xmath27 , and where for any @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
