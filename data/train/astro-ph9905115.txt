    "a relatively large number of x - ray sources in globular clusters was first pointed out by katz ( @xcite ) .",
    "these objects are thought to be close binary systems . as a mechanism for the formation of these binaries , the tidal capture of a normal star by a degenerate star",
    "was suggested by clark ( @xcite ) and fabian et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , tidally captured binaries can play an important role in globular cluster dynamics ( e.g. , ostriker @xcite , kim et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a precise mechanism for the dissipational tidal capture process was introduced by fabian et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , and a detailed computation for the amount of energy deposited into oscillatory modes during a close encounter was performed by press & teukolsky ( @xcite ) for an @xmath0 polytropic model .",
    "this work was extended by various authors to other polytropes ( lee & ostriker @xcite ; abbreviated as lo hereafter , ray et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and to realistic stellar models ( mcmillan et al .",
    "some further considerations to the subsequent dynamical evolution of tidal capture binaries are presented by kochanek ( @xcite ) and mardling ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "many numerical simulations for close stellar encounters , whose products include tidal capture binaries , have been performed ( e.g. benz & hills @xcite ; davies et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the interests for tidal capture process have been mainly concentrated on old stellar systems such as globular clusters and galactic nuclei whose densities are known to be very high .",
    "therefore , the cross sections were calculated only for the cases applicable to those systems .",
    "the range of mass in these systems is considerably smaller than that in young stellar systems .",
    "recent advances in infrared astronomy lead to the discoveries of compact young clusters near the galactic center ( okuda et al .",
    "@xcite ; nagata et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which have been also observed in detail using the _ hst _ ( figer et al .",
    "these clusters are found to be as dense as some globular clusters .",
    "the sharp image quality of the _ hst _ also enabled to find star clusters , whose age can be deduced from the population synthesis technique , from galaxies at considerable distances ( e.g. , stlin et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the evolution of young clusters near the galactic center region becomes an important issue in understanding the evolutionary history of the bulge of our galaxy , because these clusters would have rather short evaporation times .",
    "the main reason for fast dissolution is the strong tidal field environment .",
    "the dynamical process is further influenced by close encounters between stars , including tidal captures .",
    "the young clusters found in external galaxies are also of great interest in view of the general evolution of the galaxies .",
    "again , the dynamical evolution and evaporation process are the key in these problems .",
    "two - body relaxation drives the dynamical evolution and close interactions between two stars modify the course of evolution significantly ( see , for example , meylan & heggie @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of tidal interaction during stellar encounter can be incorporated in different ways depending on the methods of the study of dynamical evolution of stellar systems . in direct n - body calculations , one should know exactly when the tidal capture takes place . in statistical methods such as fokker - planck models ,",
    "the capture cross section as a function of other kinematic parameters ( usually velocity dispersion ) is necessary .    in the present research note ,",
    "we present convenient formulae for cross sections for tidal capture between two stars as a function of relative velocity at infinity .",
    "these formulae can be easily incorporated into statistical methods such as fokker - planck models or gaseous models for the studies of dynamics of star clusters .",
    "they will also be useful in making estimates for the interaction rates for a given cluster parameters .",
    "previous studies presented tidal cross sections for the limited ranges of stars .",
    "for example , the mass ratios between encountering stars considered in lo ranged only from 1 to 8 for normal - normal star pairs , and 0.5 to 1.5 for normal - degenerate pairs . also , @xmath1 was assumed and only encounters between the same polytropes were considered in lo , which may not be appropriate for encounters between stars with large mass ratios . while an @xmath2 polytrope may well represent the structure of low - mass stars , the outer structure of intermediate to massive stars ( @xmath3 ) may be better represented by a @xmath0 polytrope .",
    "thus a consideration for the encounter between @xmath2 and 3 polytropes is necessary for encounters with a large mass difference .",
    "here we extend the work of lo to obtain the cross sections for i ) encounters between stars with a very large mass ratio , ii ) encounters with mass - radius relation that deviates from conventional @xmath4 relation ( i.e. , @xmath5/[r_1/m_1]$ ] values other than 1 ) , and iii ) encounters between @xmath2 and 3 polytropes , and present the results in the form of convenient fitting formulae for cross sections and critical periastron distances .",
    "the amount of orbital energy deposited to the stellar envelope is a very steep function of the distance between stars .",
    "the relative orbit can be described as a function of energy and angular momentum .",
    "however , the relative orbit near the periastron passage can be approximated by a parabolic orbit which can be specified by only one parameter : periastron distance @xmath6 .",
    "there exists a critical @xmath6 below which the tidal interaction transforms the initial unbound system into a bound one for a given set of mass and radius pair , and the relative velocity at infinity , @xmath7 .",
    "assuming a parabolic relative orbit for the encounter , press & teukolsky ( @xcite ) expressed the deposition of kinetic energy into stellar oscillations of a star with @xmath8 and @xmath9 due to a perturbing star with @xmath10 and @xmath11 by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the spherical harmonic index , @xmath6 the apocenter radius , and the contribution of the summation behind @xmath14 to @xmath15 is negligible .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath16 is defined by @xmath17 expression for @xmath18 may be obtained by exchanging subscripts 1 and 2 in eqs .",
    "( [ deltae ] ) and ( [ eta ] ) . for @xmath19 and @xmath20 values , we use portegies zwart & meinen s ( @xcite ) fifth order fitting polynomials to the numerical calculations by lo .",
    "tidal capture takes place when the deposition of kinetic energy during the encounter @xmath21 is larger than the initially positive orbital energy @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the reduced mass of @xmath8 and @xmath10 pair .",
    "the critical @xmath6 below which the tidal energy exceeds the orbital energy depends on @xmath7 via @xmath16 .    after obtaining critical @xmath6 by requiring @xmath24",
    ", we can compute the critical impact parameter @xmath25 that leads to the critical @xmath6 ( assuming the orbit does not change in the presence of tidal interaction ) , as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath7 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "the capture cross section , @xmath28 , is simply the area of the target , @xmath29 .",
    "the velocity dependence of cross section is expected to be close to @xmath30 since the second term in the parenthesis of eq .",
    "( [ r0 ] ) is much greater than 1 , and @xmath6 is only weakly dependent on @xmath7 .",
    "the cross section depends on @xmath7 in a somewhat complex way .",
    "however , for the limited range of @xmath31 , it can be approximated as a power law on the tidal capture cross section .",
    "following lo , we provide @xmath32 as a function of @xmath9 and escape velocity at the surface of star  1 , @xmath33 : @xmath34 we obtain constants @xmath35 and @xmath36 by fitting the power law curve to @xmath28 at @xmath37 , which is typical velocity range in the globular clusters and compact young clusters . the galactic nuclei are also thought to be dense enough for tidal interactions , but the direct collision is more probable because of high velocity dispersion ( lee & nelson @xcite )",
    ".    we assumed @xmath38 for the calculation of @xmath39 , but @xmath35 and @xmath36 values are nearly insensitive to the choice of @xmath40 value because the above power law holds for a wide range of @xmath31 near @xmath41 .      for encounters between a normal and a degenerate star , we obtain @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath42 . in this subsection ,",
    "subscript 1 is for the normal star and 2 for the degenerate star . while @xmath35 is a steep function of @xmath43 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nd ] ) , @xmath36 ranges only from 2.24 ( @xmath44 ) to 2.13 ( @xmath45 ) for @xmath2 , and from 2.24 to 2.19 for @xmath0 . thus @xmath46 would be a good choice .",
    "we find that @xmath35 is well fit with a sum of two power law curves : @xmath47 where subscript nd is for normal - degenerate star encounters .",
    "( [ nd ] ) fits our calculated @xmath48 values with a relative error ( @xmath49fit - data@xmath49/data ) better than 4  % .      for encounters between normal stars ,",
    "we consider @xmath43 of 1 through 100 . in this subsection ,",
    "subscript 1 is for less massive star .",
    "encounters between normal stars involve two more parameters , @xmath11 and @xmath10 , but only one parameter , @xmath50 , is enough in adding the second normal star . for @xmath51",
    ", it is found that @xmath36 ranges from 2.12 ( @xmath52 ) to 2.24 ( @xmath45 ) for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and from 2.18 to 2.24 for @xmath0 .",
    "again , @xmath55 would be a good approximation .",
    "[ fig : nn ] shows @xmath35 for three different @xmath56 values .",
    "we find that a simple modification to the form of eq .",
    "[ nd ] can fit @xmath35 as a function of both @xmath43 and @xmath56 : @xmath57 where subscript nn is for normal - normal star encounters , and star  1 has @xmath2 in case of @xmath58=1.5:3 encounters .",
    "( [ nn ] ) fits our calculated @xmath59 values with a relative error better than 10  % .",
    "we expressed @xmath32 in terms of @xmath39 and @xmath9 following lo in sect .",
    "[ sec : formulae ] , but when @xmath60 is expressed in terms of @xmath61 and @xmath11 such that @xmath62 the @xmath56 dependence of @xmath63 becomes smaller than that of @xmath59 . also note that @xmath64 for @xmath65 is nearly the same as @xmath66 with only a slight difference near @xmath67 .",
    "critical @xmath6 for tidal captures is also frequently useful for some studies such as the ones with n - body methods .",
    "one finds the approximate critical @xmath6 as @xmath68 for the velocities that satisfy @xmath69 where the right - hand - side does not vary much from 10 .",
    "heating by tidal capture binaries is incorporated in fokker - planck models by calculating @xmath70 , where brackets indicate the average over velocity . with the maxwellian velocity distribution for stars ,",
    "we obtain @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the root - mean - square relative velocity between two stellar mass groups .",
    "the @xmath32 presented here also includes encounters that will lead to a merge before encountering a third star .",
    "we will not , however , attempt to go over this issue because it is beyond our scope in this research note .",
    "we find that the maximum velocity beyond which @xmath73 is significantly larger than 100  @xmath74 for our parameter regime . in this research note",
    ", we merely gave the cross sections .",
    "the subsequent evolution of tidally captured systems is a very important subject , but is a rather difficult to follow .",
    "if the energy deposited to the envelope of stars can be quickly radiated away before two stars become close , the final orbit of the binary will be a circle whose radius is twice of the initial @xmath6 ( lo ) .",
    "the stellar rotation induced by the tidal interactions during the circularization process can reduce the separation of circularized orbits .",
    "therefore , the tidal products are usually stellar mergers or tight binaries .    however , there are possibilities of resonant interactions between the tides and stellar orbits . in such an environment ,",
    "the tidal energy can also be transferred back to the orbital energy .",
    "the final product of such a case is a rather wide binary , although it is still  hard \" binary in terms of cluster dynamics ( kochanek @xcite , mardling @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the tidal capture could produce dynamically and observationally interesting objects in dense stellar environments .",
    "the cross sections presented here can be useful in estimating the frequencies of such interactions .",
