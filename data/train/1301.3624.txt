    "the large - scale structure of the universe observed via galaxy redshift surveys appears distorted due to the peculiar velocity of galaxies , known as the redshift - space distortions ( rsd ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the rsd breaks the statistical isotropy , and the resultant galaxy clustering exhibits characteristic anisotropies along observer s line - of - sight direction by the two competitive effects , i.e. , kaiser and finger - of - god effects @xcite .",
    "while the latter effect mostly comes from the virialized random motion of the mass ( or galaxy ) in halos , the kaiser effect apparently enhances the clustering amplitude along a line - of - sight direction , and the effect is dominated by the large - scale coherent motion . in particular , the strength of the kaiser effect is simply described by the linear theory , and is characterized by the growth - rate parameter , @xmath2 , defined as @xmath3 , where the quantities @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the linear growth factor and scale factor of the universe , respectively ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the kaiser effect can be used as a useful tool to measure the growth of cosmological structure , and combining the distance measurements , the measurement of rsd offers a unique opportunity to test the gravity theory on cosmological scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note that the galaxy redshift surveys also provide a way to measure the cosmological distance , utilizing the so - called alcock - paczynski effect @xcite . with the baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) imprinted on the large - scale structure as a robust standard ruler , we can thus measure the angular diameter distance @xmath6 and the hubble parameter @xmath7 of distant galaxies at redshift @xmath8 separately through the alcock - paczynski effect ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the large - scale galaxy distribution offers a dual cosmological probe to simultaneously constrain both the cosmic expansion and structure growth , from which we can directly test gravity , and even address the nature of late - time cosmic acceleration ( see @xcite for recent status ) .",
    "this is the main reason why ongoing and planned galaxy surveys aim at precisely measuring the rsd and baos through the clustering statistics of galaxy distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "a pursuit of such a precision measurement poses several challenging issues in theory of large - scale structure .",
    "one important issue is the development of precision theoretical tools to compute the clustering statistics of the large - scale structure .",
    "while the rsd and bao are measured from the galaxy clustering at the scales close to the linear regime of the gravitational evolution , nonlinearity of both the gravity and the rsd is known to play a crucial role in precise estimate of the parameters @xmath2 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to address such an issue and to investigate the extent to which we can accurately compute the redshift - space power spectrum and correlation function based on the perturbation theory ( pt ) . in redshift space ,",
    "a key point is that the applicable range of linear theory prediction is fairly narrower than that in real space , and the corrections coming from the nonlinear clustering and rsd need to be properly incorporated into theoretical predictions even on such large - scales as @xmath11mpc@xmath12 .",
    "this is because , in terms of real - space quantities , the redshift - space power spectrum and/or correlation function can not simply be expressed as the large - scale two - point statistics of the underlying fields and are significantly affected by the small scale physics@xcite .",
    "thus , for a reliable theoretical predictions with a wider applicable range , a sophisticated treatment of both the gravitational clustering and rsd is required .    in our previous studies",
    ", we have proposed an improved model of rsd relevant in the weakly nonlinear regime @xcite ( see @xcite for other improved models or treatments ) .",
    "the model properly accounts of the non - gaussian nature of the rsd based on the low-@xmath0 expansion .",
    "the resulting power spectrum expression differs from the one of the so - called streaming model frequently used in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) with the introduction of additional corrections associated with nonlinear couplings between velocity and density fields @xcite .",
    "a detailed investigation revealed that these corrections can give an important contribution to the acoustic structure of baos which gives rise to a slight increase in the amplitude of monopole and quadrupole spectra .",
    "while the model has been originally proposed for the matter power spectrum , with an improved pt of gravitational clustering as well as an appropriate parameterization of galaxy / halo bias , it has been shown to successfully describe not only the matter but also the halo power spectra in @xmath1-body simulations @xcite .",
    "in this paper , the third of a series on this method , we present consistent pt calculations aiming at giving predictions in both fourier and configuration spaces . in all of our previous works ,",
    "the pt predictions have been done in some heterogeneous ways .",
    "that is , while the improved pt scheme by ref .",
    "@xcite is applied to compute the power spectra for density and velocity fields , the standard pt treatment is partly used to compute the new corrections of the rsd , for which we have only given the predictions based on the leading - order pt calculation .",
    "it is generally known that the standard pt treatment produces an ill - behaved pt expansion that has poor convergence properties ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is indeed the case when we compute the redshift - space power spectrum .",
    "because of the bad uv behavior , the correction terms computed with standard pt eventually become dominant at small scales . then",
    ", a naive computation of the correlation function through the direct integration of the power spectrum ceases to give a physically reasonable answer .",
    "this is one of the main reasons why the previous works have focused on the redshift - space power spectrum , not the correlation function .    here , in order to remedy the bad uv behaviors , we will apply the specific resummed pt scheme referred to as the multi - point propagator expansion or @xmath13 expansion @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this scheme is that the non - perturbative properties , which can be obtained in standard pt by summing up infinite series of pt expansions , are whole encapsulated in the multi - point propagators , with which any statistical quantities including the power spectrum , bispectrum and trispectrum can be built up . in particular , the asymptotic behaviors of the multi - point propagators are analytically known @xcite , and with a help of these analytic properties , a novel regularized treatment has been proposed @xcite , allowing us to consistently interpolate between standard pt results at low-@xmath0 and the expected resummed behavior at high-@xmath0 . in this paper , making full use of the regularized @xmath13 expansion , we are now able to give a consistent calculation for both the power spectrum and correlation function in redshift space",
    ". we will present the results including the pt corrections up to the next - to - next - to - leading order , i.e. two - loop order , and compare those with @xmath1-body simulations in detail . with the calculations at the two - loop order",
    ", we will also discuss the potential impact of the higher - order non - gaussian corrections coming from the rsd .",
    "while the model of rsd has been derived based on the low-@xmath0 expansion , one of the corrections , comparable to the two - loop order in pt expansion , has been ignored in previous studies without any justification . here , we will explicitly quantify the size of this correction , and with a help of the @xmath1-body simulations , we will explore the potential systematics of our model predictions .",

    "@xcite , and discuss several remarks on the perturbation theory ( pt ) treatment in computing redshift - space power spectrum or correlation function .",
    "we begin by writing the exact expression for redshift - space power spectrum .",
    "let us denote the density and velocity fields by @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "owing to the distant - observer approximation , which is usually valid for the observation of distant galaxies of our interest , one can write ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the separation in real space and @xmath18 indicates an ensemble average . in the above expression , the @xmath8-axis is taken as observer s line - of - sight direction , and we define the directional cosine @xmath19 by @xmath20 .",
    "further , we defined @xmath21 , and @xmath22 for the line - of - sight component of the velocity field . here , the function @xmath2 is the logarithmic derivative of the linear growth function @xmath23 given by @xmath24 .",
    "note that the above expression has been derived without invoking the dynamical information for velocity and density fields , i.e. , the euler equation and/or continuity equation .",
    "clearly , the redshift - space power spectrum @xmath25 , given as the function of wavenumber @xmath0 and the directional cosine @xmath19 , can not be derived from the mere two - point statistics of the underlying fields .",
    "if we expand the exponent in the bracket , it can be described by the infinite series of multi - point spectra of density and velocity fields . in order to derive an analytically tractable expression applicable to the large - scale cosmological observations ,",
    "we rewrite the expression ( [ eq : pkred_exact ] ) with @xmath26 where the quantities @xmath27 , @xmath28 are respectively given by @xmath29 we shall rewrite the ensemble average @xmath30 in terms of cumulants . to do this",
    ", we use the relation between the cumulant and moment generating functions . for the stochastic vector field @xmath31",
    ", we have ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath32 with @xmath33 being an arbitrary constant vector , @xmath34 . taking the derivative twice with respect to @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we then set @xmath37 .",

    "\\label{eq : pkred_exact2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression clearly reveals the coupling between density and velocity fields associated with the kaiser and finger - of - god effects .",
    "in addition to the prefactor @xmath40 , the ensemble averages over the quantities @xmath41 and @xmath42 responsible for the kaiser effect all include the exponential factor @xmath43 , which can produce a non - negligible correlation between density and velocity .    based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : pkred_exact2 ] ) , the proposition raised by ref .",
    "@xcite is the following :    * the exponential prefactor , @xmath40 , which is responsible for the suppression of power spectrum due to the virialized random and coherent motion , turns out to mainly affect the broadband shape of the power spectrum ( sec.iii-b of @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the effect of this is known to be significant on bao scales , and seems difficult to treat perturbatively .",
    "thus , we replace the exponential prefactor with general functional form , @xmath44 with @xmath45 being a constant , just ignoring the spatial correlation of @xmath46 . * in the bracket , the exponential factor @xmath43 is very likely to affect the structure of bao in the power spectrum , since the bracket includes the term leading to the kaiser effect in linear regime . at the scale of our interest , the contribution coming from the factor @xmath43 should be basically small , and the perturbative expansion may work well . regarding the quantity @xmath27 as a small expansion parameter , we perturbatively expand the terms in the bracket of the integrand . up to the second order in @xmath27 , we have @xmath47    then , from eq .",

    ", the power spectrum @xmath50 is originated from the term @xmath51 , and it corresponds to the nonlinear generalization of the kaiser formula frequently used in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath52 the functions @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are the auto - power spectra of density and velocity divergence , and their cross spectrum .",
    "the velocity divergence is defined by @xmath56 .",

    "@xcite , it has been neglected . while we basically follow their treatment here ignoring the @xmath59 term , as already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is a priori no longer consistent at two - loop order .",
    "the validity of such an heterogeneous treatment , and specifically the impact of @xmath59 term on the predictions of redshift - space power spectrum will be later discussed in detail ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : discussion ] ) .    in computing each term of the expression ( [ eq : tns_model ] ) with the pt treatment of large - scale structure , we invoke a single - stream approximation , in which the dynamics of large - scale structure is described by the density @xmath14 and velocity divergence @xmath61 .",
    "the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kaiser ] ) is also the outcome of the single - stream approximation , and it is usually valid as long as we are interested in the linear and weakly nonlinear regimes of the gravitational clustering .",

    "the expression ( [ eq : tns_model ] ) with the corrections ( [ eq : a_term ] ) and ( [ eq : b_term ] ) still holds some non - perturbative properties .",

    ", the model has been shown to accurately describe the power spectrum in weakly nonlinear regime .",
    "our rsd model may be regarded as a semi - pt model in the sense that a part of the terms ( i.e. , damping function ) is not perturbatively treated , introducing a free parameter .",
    "nevertheless , with the @xmath13 expansion , the model for the first time gives a consistent and accurate prediction for both the power spectra and correlation functions .",
    "the expression of redshift - space power spectrum in previous section involves not only the real - space power spectra but also the higher - order corrections such as bispectrum .",
    "although our main focus is the weakly non - linear regime of gravitational clustering , the standard pt is known to produce ill - behaved higher - order corrections , that lack good convergence properties .",
    "therefore , practical calculations of redshift - space power spectrum are better made with a resummed pt scheme , improving the convergence of pt expansion on small scales , so that correlation functions can be safely computed . in this paper , we consider the @xmath13 expansion , adopting the prescription for the regularization pt calculation by ref .  @xcite .",

    "this fact leads to a novel regularized scheme , in which the low- and high-@xmath0 behaviors are smoothly interpolated without any ambiguities @xcite .",
