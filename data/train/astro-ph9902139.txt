    "a decay in the orbital period @xmath14 was found ( levine et al . 1993 ) , probably due to tidal interaction between the orbit and the rotation of the companion star , which is supposed to be in the hydrogen shell burning phase .",

    "disk - fed magnetic neutron stars have been predicted to experience spin - up or spin - down episodes due to the torque exerted by the accretion disk . in the magnetically - threaded accretion disk model , first suggested by ghosh & lamb ( 1979a , 1979b ) , the spin - up rate @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the moment of inertia of the neutron star , @xmath34 the accretion rate , @xmath35 the gravity constant and @xmath36 the inner edge of the accretion disk .",
    "the dimensionless torque @xmath37 , which includes the torque contribution from both matter accretion and magnetic stress , is a function of the  fastness parameter \" @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the corotation radius .    with the _",
    "mean _ spin - up rate and x - ray luminosity observed in smc x-1 , equation ( 1 ) has two sets of solutions : ( 1 ) the magnetic moment of the pulsar @xmath40 is less than a few @xmath41 with @xmath42 ; ( 2 ) @xmath40 is around @xmath43 with @xmath44 ( li & van den heuvel 1997 ) .",
    "if the x - ray intensity during the low state , which is lower than that during the high state by a factor of @xmath45 , is due to a reduction in the mass accretion rate , the condition @xmath46 implies @xmath47 .",
    "however , gruber & rothschild ( 1984 ; see also levine et al .",
    "1996 ; wojdowski et al .",
    "1998 ) have suggested the possibility of modulation of the observed x - ray intensity by a tilted , precessing , accretion disk like that in her x-1 ( katz 1973 ) , which would imply that the intrinsic x - ray luminosity or mass accretion rate of the pulsar could be quite steady . in this case",
    "the pulsar magnetic moment may lie between @xmath48 and @xmath43 , though a magnetic moment as high as @xmath49 seems less likely for smc x-1 , because of the following arguments . as seen in fig .",
    "2 , the spin - up rate of the pulsar in 1980s and 1990s varied around its mean value by @xmath50 .",
    "the most straightforward explanation for this change is that the accretion rate has fluctuated by a similar ( or a bit larger ) factor .",
    "if @xmath51 , @xmath36 would be so close to @xmath52 that the pulsar would spin down when the accretion rate decreased by a small factor ( less than 20% ) , contradicted with the steady spin - up observed .",
    "the above arguments are based on the classical accretion torque models , which , however , has encountered difficulties in explaining the period evolution in the x - ray pulsar cen x-3 , which possesses many similarities with smc x-1 .",
    "both pulsars are in a close binary system with a supergiant companion star overflowing its roche - lobe , accreting from a disk ( tjemkes et al .",
    "1986 ) at a high rate , with the x - ray luminosities close to or higher than the eddington luminosity ( nagase 1989 ) .",
    "tidal torque between the distorted supergiant and the neutron star leads to an orbital decay at a similar rate in the two systems ( cf .",
    "white et al . 1995 )",
    ". however , cen x-3 exhibits a pulse period evolution quite different from smc x-1 . prior to 1991 ,",
    "cen x-3 had already been found to show a secular slow spin - up superposed with fluctuations and short episodes of spin - down .",
    "the more frequently sampled _ batse _ data show that cen x-3 exhibits 10 - 100 d intervals of steady spin - up and spin - down at a much larger rate , and the long - term ( @xmath3 years ) spin - up trend is actually the average consequence of the frequent transitions between spin - up and spin - down ( finger et al .",
    "such spin behavior has been found in at least 4 out of 8 persistent x - ray pulsars observed with _ batse _",
    "( bildsten et al .",
    "1997 ) , and is difficult to explain in terms of classical accretion torque models , which would require finely tuned step - function - like changes in the mass accretion rate .    it is interesting to see whether the secular spin - up in smc x-1 actually consists of transitions of short - term spin - up and spin - down , as in cen x-3 . if it is the case , this would indicate a larger instantaneous accretion torque , and hence a higher magnetic moment .",
    "new values for the spin period of smc  x-1 have been determined during recent observations .",
    "these observations clearly show that the steady spin - up of the neutron star has continued .",
    "this makes smc x-1 the exceptional x - ray pulsar in which no spin - down episode has been observed , though it is still unknown whether this spin - up occurs in reality or it is just an apparent superposition of more frequent spin - up and spin - down episodes .",
    "the magnetic moment of the pulsar could be as small as @xmath53 if its spin trend can be described by classical accretion torque models .",
    "detailed timing observations are strongly recommanded to resolve this subject , and will have important implications on the theoretical models for angular momentum transfer between a magnetic neutron star and the surrounding accretion disk .",
