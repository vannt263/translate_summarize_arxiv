    "an extensive air shower ( eas ) is a large number of secondary particles originating from a high energy primary cosmic particle .",
    "a lot of efforts have been made for understanding the structure and development of extensive air showers .",
    "@xcite . for accurate investigation of the eas events we first have to know their direction and core position . the better the measurement of these parameters , the more precise exploring extensive air shower structures .",
    "plane wave front approximation ( pwfa)@xcite is the simplest way for finding direction of eas and spherical front approximation@xcite is a complement approach of it for acquiring more accurate results",
    ". there are various methods for finding core location of extensive air showers such as : maximum likelihood method for large showers @xcite , fitting to the lateral density distribution function @xcite , and its modified form @xcite , and neural network method @xcite .",
    "all these methods , use the particle density information without considering their arrival time information ( ati ) . +",
    "some attempts have been made to use mean arrival time and disk thickness as a measure of the shower core distance @xcite .",
    "measurement of the eas disk structure was first attempted by bassi , clark and rossi in 1953 @xcite and continued later @xcite .",
    "however , recently it has been shown that both mean arrival time and eas front thickness in individual showers fluctuate strongly and can not be a good measure of the distance from the eas axis @xcite .",
    "+ although because of strong fluctuations we can not use ati as a measure of the distance from the core , at least we can use it to provide a statistical analysis about some of eas features . in this paper ati",
    "is used , in addition to the density information ( we use density information only as a measure of distances of each two detectors , in order to find core position and correct determination of eas direction ) .",
    "this method is a new and model independent ( e.g. lateral density distribution function depends on the precision of greisen function ) approach which can be used as an alternative way for finding core locations of extensive air showers .",
    "another feature of this method is its independence of number sensitive detectors ( detectors which are sensitive to the number of crossing particles ) . + in order to examine the capability of the method , corsika @xcite package has been used .",
    "we have developed an algorithm using distances between two particles ( the distance of two detectors which are triggered by the crossing particles , i.e. the on detectors , in an array during an eas event ) for finding the nearest particles to the core among all eas particles . in this algorithm , two common properties of eas core",
    "have been considered : 1- particle density in core neighborhood is more than the other regions ; consequently , distance between two triggered detectors near the core is smaller than those of two triggered detectors far from the core .",
    "2- due to spherical front of eas , in vertical eas , secondary particles near the core region , reach ground level sooner than other particles .",
    "this feature will be valid for inclined showers by correction the inclination angle effects .",
    "for simplicity , we will be investigating vertical eas events at first and then generalizing this method to inclined eass . + a simple approximation method to find the core position is to calculate the center of mass of the on detectors which is relatively a good approximation to find core of those eass whose cores are very close to the center of an array . for enhancement of precision of this method",
    "we have introduced a procedure which improves the capability of the center of mass for finding core position even if the core position is far from the center of the array .",
    "+ an important feature of eass is their spherical front which is approximately a spherical cap .",
    "therefore , particles in the core region reach ground level sooner than other particles",
    ". we can demonstrate this phenomenon by considering this fact that if we select randomly any two secondary particles of an eas , we can see the first particle reaching ground level sooner , and on average is closer to the core position .",
    "figure ( 1 ) shows that by increasing distance between two particles , the average distance of the first particle from the core increase slowly and the average distance of second particle from the core increases rapidly . +",
    "another feature of eass is higher density of particles near the core region .",
    "the smaller distance of two particles from each other , their smaller distances from the core on average .",
    "we checked this feature for electrons and muons separately , and did not observe any distinguishable difference .",
    "previous investigation shows that the arrival time difference between electrons and muons is negligible for distances less than 200 meters @xcite .",
    "the density of secondary particles quickly decreases by increasing the distance of particles from the core region which is opposed to the slow increasing of the average arrival time of particles which is shown in figure ( 2 ) .",
    "a rough investigation shows that random fluctuation of the density of the particles is very much less than their arrival time fluctuations ( particularly far from the core ) .",
    "+ based on these facts , the following procedure for finding the core position is proposed as : + particles ( on detectors ) are indexed based on their arrival time ( trigger time ) , the first arrived particle has the first index @xmath0 and so forth ( we assume that every detector can just detect the first crossing particle and is unable to detect any other particle during an event ) . figure ( 2 ) suggests that if @xmath1 then @xmath2(@xmath3 is the distance of the first particle among @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 from the core and @xmath7 is its ensemble average ) . by this outcome and examining figure ( 1 ) this result can be achieved : @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 ) . if we want to find the nearest particle to the core , selecting the @xmath4th particle seems to be logical , but on the basis of the previous discussion the better choice will be obtained by the following procedure : find the minimum value among @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "assume that the @xmath12 is the minimum value then @xmath5 will probably be the nearest particle to the core position ( notice @xmath13 ) .      in this algorithm , off - core particles",
    "are eliminated and only nearby ones are selected ( as a list ) .",
    "let us assume that there are @xmath14 secondary particles ( on detectors ) in an eas event .",
    "knowing the fact @xmath15 ( @xmath16 are respective particles ) , we form a matrix @xmath17 , whose elements are @xmath10(distance between @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) . in view of the fact that @xmath20 is symmetric , we just consider the upper triangle of the matrix ( without principal diagonal elements ) .",
    "@xmath21 we can find the smallest element ( @xmath22 ) under two conditions :    1 .   if @xmath23 , @xmath24 then @xmath25 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath26 , @xmath13 then @xmath25 .",
    "now we select the @xmath4th particle as the first particle of the list ( because of its arrival time ) .",
    "next in the @xmath4th row we find the biggest element ( @xmath27 ) under the condition :    * if @xmath26 , @xmath13 then @xmath28 .",
    "we should now eliminate the @xmath6th particle as an off - core particle and then the @xmath4th and @xmath6th rows and columns of the matrix @xmath20 . by repeating the same procedure for the new matrix ( @xmath29 )",
    ", we will reach a position in which half of the particles are retained and half of them are eliminated .",
    "now , it is expected that the center of mass of the retained particles is a good measure of the core position . + up to now our discussion was limited to the vertical eass . now",
    "the inclined eass are also examined . in the case of examining inclined eass , ati of particles",
    "are used in addition to their distances from the core .",
    "assume that the @xmath30 and @xmath31 are respectively the the zenith and the azimuth angles of arrival direction .",
    "the coordinates of the particles on the ground level are @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "now , the coordinates of the particles are transformed to a new coordinate system whose @xmath35 and @xmath36 axes are perpendicular to the arrival direction . to fulfill this objective , we select an arbitrary point ( e.g. center of mass of all particles ) then the coordinates of the particles are rotated counterclockwise around the @xmath37 axis through an angle @xmath31 and then the new coordinates are rotated clockwise around the @xmath38 through an angle @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath37 components in the new coordinate system are @xmath39 .",
    "then ati of particles are corrected by @xmath40 ( c is the speed of light ) .",
    "now the inclined showers are examined like the vertical ones .",
    "notice because of the statistical nature of the procedure , the coordinates of the particles are not transformed to the new coordinate system .",
    "+ on the other hand , when our detectors are sensitive to the number of the crossing particles , the algorithm changes as follows : + another matrix @xmath14 is formed whose elements are @xmath41 ( @xmath42 is the number of the detected particles by @xmath4th detector ) in correspondence with @xmath10 element in @xmath20 .",
    "now we first impose maximum @xmath43 condition , then other conditions for finding nearby particles .",
    "assume that @xmath43 has been selected and @xmath44 , then @xmath5 is a nearby particle .",
    "if @xmath45 ati will be a determining factor .",
    "+ the precision of final results of simefic algorithm is very tied to the precision of arrival direction ( ati of particles has a lot of fluctuation and if the arrival direction fluctuation is added to them , the uncertainty increases greatly ) .",
    "hence , we must find arrival direction with high precision .",
    "there are a variety of methods for correction of arrival direction such as : sphere front approximation , use hybrid detectors and so on .",
    "now an alternative method is introduced that can be used in parallel to the other methods .",
    "assume that we have a @xmath46 set ( secondary particles or on detectors ) . by using the simefic algorithm @xmath47 set",
    "number of @xmath47 members is half of the first one . now using pwfa for the @xmath47 set , arrival direction with a rather high precision",
    "can be found .",
    "the reason for better approximation of this technique in comparison with the pwfa for the set @xmath46 is that ati has less fluctuation in near core region than in far region from the core .",
    "the front of an eas is also smoother in near core region than far region . in view of these facts",
    "the simefic method presents a better approximation in contrast to the pwfa for all of the particles .",
    "now we propose a refinement to the simefic method : first finding arrival direction by @xmath47 set , then using this arrival direction as an input parameter for simefic algorithm . again , by using simefic algorithm for the primary set , @xmath46 another set @xmath48 , will be reached . from now on we just use @xmath48 as the output of the simefic .",
    "the geographical coordinates of alborz observatory location ( in city of tehran ) has been imposed in eas simulations ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 and 1200 meters over sea level ) .",
    "geomagnetic field components of tehran are @xmath51 @xmath52 . for simulation of low - energy hadron interactions , gheisha @xcite package and for high energy cases qgsjet01 package have been used .",
    "zenith angles of particles were chosen between @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the compositions of particles have been @xmath55 protons and @xmath56 helium nuclei .",
    "primary particle energy ranges are between 100 tev and 5 pev .",
    "+ the assumed array is an square detector array with an area of @xmath57 composed of @xmath58 detectors on a lattice with a 5-meter lattice constant . since arrays around the world",
    "are chiefly made up of scintillator detectors with high efficiency , they are not sensitive to the position of the secondary crossing particles and we can not exactly realize how many particles have passed through them . therefore , the following assumptions have been applied for the simulation : +    1 .",
    "when the first particle crosses an area of @xmath58 , the detector is triggered .",
    "2 .   the next particles which cross through this hypothetical detector ( second , third particles and etc . )",
    "are not taken into account .",
    "the coordinates of the triggered particles are assigned to the hypothetical detector ( area of @xmath58 ) center .",
    "the center of mass of the on detectors will be as follows : @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "if the coordinates of the eas real core are denoted by @xmath61 , the distance of the real core and the center of mass will be @xmath62 .",
    "+ now the simefic method is used to find eas core ( instead of the center of mass of all particles ) and once again we measure the real core distance from the eas center .",
    "the results are shown in figure ( 3 ) .",
    "it is clear that by increasing the distance of the real core from the center of the array ( we consider the center of the array as the point @xmath63 , the real core in this figure is on the diagonal line on the points @xmath64 , and @xmath4 ranges from 1 to 10 ) the center of mass of all the on detectors is precise only for those eass whose core are near the central part of the array and by increasing the distance of eas core from the center of the array , the error increases gradually .",
    "but in the simefic method the precision even up to 50% of the length of the array is approximately the same .",
    "3000 eass have been averaged for each step .",
    "acceptance condition for eass is triggering at least 4% of detectors of the array by secondary particles .",
    "+ for example , in figure ( 4 ) an eas with core on point @xmath65 is shown . in this figure , detectors accepted by simefic method are shown by the bold circles and the omitted ones by the empty circles .",
    "it is clear that although the shower real core is near the edges of the array , this algorithm has approximately chosen proper detectors .",
    "although some of the detectors which are far from the core and near each other , have not been chosen ( the omission of these detectors is the most important effect of using temporal information ) .",
    "this method is precise up to the point that almost half of the detected particles are symmetrically spread around the core . + in figure ( 5 ) spatial angle between the eas primary direction and the direction which has been found by the simefic method and pwfa have been shown .",
    "it is clear that simefic approximation has approved pwfa significantly . +",
    "now assume that detectors are also sensitive to the number of crossing particles too .",
    "figure 6 also shows simefic results for number sensitive detectors .",
    "in this investigation we have developed a simple method for finding the position of the eas core and the proper correction of the pwfa for finding the eas direction . in addition to the information of the secondary particles positions on the ground level ati is also used .",
    "this method is based on measuring the distances between pairs of particles , choosing particles with the minimum distance and arrival time , omitting particles with the maximum distance(from the core ) and arrival time and using center of mass of chosen particles for finding core location of eas .",
    "+ the essence and scheme of the method envisioned by scrutinization of vertical showers have been formulated for inclined showers . an operational algorithm has been developed and tested on @xmath66 simulated eas events generated by corsika package .",
    "the analysis technique proposed here is adequate for simple eas arrays without number sensitive detectors and has been generalized for arrays with number sensitive detectors .",
    "+ the results of applying the method on the simulated events show that , the eas core location is improved to about the distance between the array s adjacent detectors for an eas whose core falls within central detectors of the array . furthermore , by using the pwfa for the on detectors selected by this method , the spatial angular resolution of the primary direction is improved significantly compared with the case of using pwfa to all on detectors of the array during an event ( figure ( 5 ) ) .",
