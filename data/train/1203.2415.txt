    "in the last decades , quantum control has known significant improvements both at theoretical and practical levels ( cf.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "results have been obtained on existence of controls  @xcite or efficient ways to compute and carry out laser fields that achieve some goals concerning the state of quantum systems  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the design of relevant laser fields plays also a major role when the goal is to identify some properties of the quantum system to be controlled . in this way",
    ", some methods have been designed to identify finite dimensional systems characteristics  @xcite , or to compute discriminant laser fields  @xcite .",
    "note that operator identification in relation to the schrdinger equation has already been studied in the literature . as an example",
    ", we refer to  @xcite for a theoretical result , where no laser interaction is considered .    in this paper , we focus on the case where only one fixed laser is used to identify in finite given time the free hamiltonian and the dipole moment . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", we obtain a local existence result : we prove that the inversion is always possible in the neighborhood of some particular states . as a by - product",
    ", we emphasize some features of the laser fields that enables the identification .    following the local approach we use to obtain this result , we present in a second part , a time discretized setting and fixed - point methods to solve numerically our problem . in particular , a newton method is proposed together with a continuation method that allows us to solve problems where the local assumption does not hold .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the mathematical formulation of our problem is given in section  [ sec : setting ] and a local controllability result is presented in section  [ sec : locrts ] . in section  [ sec : algo ] , we present the algorithms to solve numerically the identification problem . we conclude with some tests in section  [ sec : test ] .",
    "let us finally introduce some notations concerning particular matrix sets that will be used throughout the paper .",
    "given @xmath0 , we denote by @xmath1 and @xmath2 the sets of matrices of size @xmath3 with complex and real coefficients respectively",
    ". then , define @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the adjoint matrix associated to @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the identity matrix of @xmath8 . here , for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we have omitted the dependence of these sets with respect to @xmath9 . in",
    "what follows , we denote by @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote respectively the real and imaginary parts of a complex number @xmath12 .",
    "given a matrix @xmath6 , we denote by @xmath13 its transposed .",
    "fix @xmath14 , and consider a system @xmath15 whose dynamics over @xmath16 $ ] is ruled by the schrdinger equation : @xmath17u(t),\\label{eq : schrod1}\\\\ u(0)&=&u_{init}\\label{eq : schrod2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the matrix of the internal hamiltonian , @xmath19 a laser field , @xmath20 the matrix associated with the dipole moment . for relevant applications , the matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 are not supposed to commute .",
    "the initial state @xmath23 is fixed . in this equation , @xmath24 is given and the pair @xmath25 is searched such that at time @xmath26 , the state reaches a given target state @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath28 in other words , given the mapping @xmath29 the main question that will be investigated in this paper is the surjectivity of @xmath30 .    in our work , the internal hamiltonian @xmath21 is searched as real hermitian ( i.e. symmetric ) matrix .",
    "this is a particular situation as in general it is only supposed to be complex hermitian and not real .",
    "nevertheless , for the applications we have in mind this restriction is very natural since the hamiltonian is a sum of a kinetic operator and a potential , both real .",
    "for the same reasons , we suppose that the dipole moment @xmath22 is real ( hermitian thus symmetric ) but we assume moreover that the diagonal elements are null .",
    "this additional assumption is motivated both by invariance properties ( the diagonal of @xmath21 as matrix commutes with the diagonal of @xmath22 as matrix ) but also by the desire to identify an unique pair @xmath31 since in this way the number of unknowns ( dimension of @xmath32 plus that of @xmath33 ) equals the number of equations ( the dimension of @xmath34 ) .",
    "note that one can easily prove the following conservation property : @xmath35,\\ \\|u(t)\\|_{{\\mathcal}u}=\\|u_{init}\\|_{{\\mathcal}u},\\ ] ] where we have denoted by @xmath36 the norm associated to the scalar product @xmath37 this problem is related to inverse problems in quantum control  @xcite , but unlike previous works , we do not aim here at designing relevant laser fields to identify the pair @xmath31 but rather to investigate the properties of the fields @xmath38 that make equation   invertible and algorithms to compute numerically the corresponding solution operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "in this section , we present some theoretical results about the local inversion of equation  . more precisely , we make use of the calculus of variations to obtain a local inversion theorem .    given a pair @xmath31",
    ", we first introduce the tangent space @xmath39 , which is the space of matrices defined by : @xmath40 we then consider the differential operator of @xmath30 defined by : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is solution at time @xmath26 of the linearized schrdinger equation : @xmath43\\delta u(t)+[\\delta    h_0+\\varepsilon(t)\\delta \\mu]u(t),\\ ] ] and @xmath44 follows equation",
    ".    we will prove that @xmath30 is an onto mapping using the fact that @xmath45 also satisfies this property . this strategy",
    "is motivated by the following known result :    supposed that @xmath46 is an onto mapping , i.e. @xmath47 then @xmath30 is locally onto in a neighborhood of @xmath31 .",
    "we shall prove that @xmath45 is an onto mapping on the neighborhood of all states of the form @xmath48 . to do this ,",
    "we compute explicitly an inverse mapping .",
    "[ th : ontoloc ] given @xmath49 , define @xmath50 as the matrix that diagonalizes @xmath51 in the following way : @xmath52 with @xmath53 the diagonal matrix with coefficients @xmath54 .",
    "suppose that for @xmath55 , @xmath56 then @xmath57 is an onto mapping and its inverse is given by : @xmath58 the matrices @xmath59 and @xmath60 are given by : @xmath61 where the coefficients @xmath62 and @xmath63 of the matrices @xmath64 and @xmath65 are given by :    @xmath66    here @xmath67 are the coefficients of @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we fix @xmath70 and solve @xmath71 + first , one can show the identities : @xmath72 where the variation @xmath73 is defined by the evolution equation : @xmath74\\delta u_0(t)+ [ \\delta    h_0+\\varepsilon(t)\\delta \\mu]u_0(t).\\ ] ] note that such an identity holds also when @xmath75 . since @xmath76 is invertible , showing that   has a solution is equivalent to show that @xmath77 has a solution , with @xmath78 since @xmath70 . a nice property of the trajectory",
    "@xmath79 is that equation   can be solved explicitly .",
    "indeed , let us denote by @xmath80 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , with @xmath81 the coefficients of the matrices @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively .",
    "expanding   gives rise , in the case @xmath85 to @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "+ in the case @xmath89 , one finds that @xmath90 note that the assumption @xmath91 combined with @xmath92 implies that @xmath93 , so that @xmath94 .",
    "the result follows .    in this theorem , we have defined @xmath95 arbitrarily .",
    "this theorem gives a first hint about conditions required to identify @xmath31 .",
    "condition   is weaker to the standard non - degeneracy condition @xmath96 and is in practice often satisfied .",
    "condition   deals with the laser field itself .",
    "it is a non - resonant condition to control the system .",
    "in this section , we present two algorithms to solve  .",
    "the strategy we follow is a direct adaptation of previous results and proofs : we consider local approximations based on fixed point iterative solvers . in our approach ,",
    "a crucial step consists in obtaining an appropriate time discretized version of  . in the first part",
    ", we build such an approximation that enables the exact computation of the derivative of the final state @xmath97 with respect to @xmath31 and derive from this setting a numerical strategy .      in order to simulate numerically equation",
    ", we introduce the following time discretization : give @xmath98 , we denote by @xmath99 the time step and for @xmath100 by @xmath101 and @xmath102 the approximations of @xmath103 and @xmath104 . in order to preserve the unitary property of the matrices @xmath44 at the discrete level",
    ", we use a crank - nicholson scheme ruled by the formula : @xmath105 the corresponding iteration is then given by : @xmath106 where @xmath107 .",
    "+ let us now detail the effect of variations @xmath59",
    ", @xmath60 in @xmath21 and @xmath22 on the sequence @xmath108 .",
    "we have : @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "this finally gives rise to : @xmath111 since the initial value is fixed , we obtain : @xmath112 this result can be seen as a discretized version of   where @xmath22 is not necessarily null .",
    "we insist on the fact that such a result is specific to the crank - nicholson discretization . as far as we know , no other numerical solvers give rise to discretization of   where the variations @xmath59 and @xmath60 are explicit .",
    "we now present some iterative solvers to compute solutions of  .",
    "in the discrete setting , we still denote by @xmath30 the operator : @xmath113 to solve the equation @xmath114 , a newton method would consist in the following iteration : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the iteration index , @xmath117 , @xmath118 .",
    "+ in our case , reads : @xmath119 using  , one can rewrite this equation as follows : @xmath120 where we recall that the unknowns are @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "this equation has generally no solutions , since its left hand side belongs to @xmath123 what is not the case for its right hand side . to solve this problem , we replace @xmath124 by a first order approximation @xmath125 .",
    "two possible choices are : @xmath126 in the numerical tests , the same behavior is observed when using the first or the second definition .",
    "the previous method can be simplified to obtain a procedure where no matrix needs to be assembled and the inverted during iterations . instead of up - dating at each iteration in the pair @xmath31 in the term @xmath127 of formula",
    ", one can keep a constant approximation @xmath128 of the solution .",
    "we denote by @xmath129 the corresponding sequence of states .",
    "the iteration then reads : @xmath130 where @xmath131 is defined in the previous section , see   and  .",
    "note that such an algorithm is actually a time - discretized version of the fixed point used in the proof of theorem  [ th : ontoloc ] , except that here @xmath22 is not supposed to be null .",
    "both previous methods require inversions of linear systems which are not given explicitly in our formulations . to fill in this gap",
    ", we explain here how to assemble the matrices , i.e. to rewrite the equation @xmath132 in terms of linear system . in what follows ,",
    "we denote by @xmath133 the vector representation of a matrix @xmath6 consisting in concatenating vertically its columns . a first step to do",
    "this is to note that the later equation reads as follows : @xmath134 with @xmath135 here , @xmath136 denotes the kronecker product , @xmath137 , the term by term product of two matrices @xmath138 and @xmath139 is denoted by @xmath140 and @xmath141 denotes the matrix of @xmath2 whose coefficients are equal to 1 .    a second step",
    "must then be carried out : since the matrices @xmath59 and @xmath60 are symmetric , one has to consider the columns of the matrices in that correspond to the coefficients of @xmath59 located , e.g. , above the diagonal and the coefficients of @xmath60 located strictly above the diagonal . in the same way",
    ", only the lines of the resulting system that correspond to the coefficients located above the diagonal of @xmath142 shall be considered .",
    "taking the real and the imaginary part of the equations , the resulting system is of size @xmath143 .",
    "the algorithms proposed in section  [ sec : fpm ] are only locally convergent .",
    "the purpose of this section is to present a continuation method that enables to extend their range of application .    as mentioned above ,",
    "numerous methods exist to solve the control problem where the laser term @xmath24 in equation   is unknown and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are given  @xcite .",
    "based on this fact , the method we propose is the following . given an initial guess @xmath144 , find a control @xmath145 such that @xmath146 , the final state associated to @xmath144 correctly approximates @xmath27 .",
    "given @xmath147 $ ] , we define the interpolated fields @xmath148 . a fixed point method as the one presented in section  [ sec : fpm ] can then be applied with @xmath144 as an initial guess to solve the operator control problem with @xmath149 .",
    "our algorithm consists in repeating this procedure by solving iteratively the operator control problem associated to the field @xmath150 using @xmath151 as initial guess .",
    "carrying this procedure up to @xmath152 enables to solve the original problem .",
    "in this last section , we present some numerical results obtained with the algorithms of the previous sections . as a laser term in equation  , we use @xmath153 .",
    "the other numerical data are @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "we first test our newton method . in this way",
    ", we choose randomly a pair @xmath31 , with coefficients in @xmath159 $ ] and compute the corresponding final state @xmath160 .",
    "then , we start the newton procedure with an initialization @xmath161 where @xmath162 are also chosen randomly . an example of computation",
    "is given in the next table .       here",
    ", we refind a pair @xmath31 starting from a @xmath163 random perturbation .",
    "we see that the numerical convergence is obtained after 6 iterations .",
    "note also that the quadratic convergence is observed .      in a second test",
    ", we use the continuation method presented in  [ sec : glob ] to tackle a problem where the algorithms of section  [ sec : fpm ] do not apply . given a target",
    "@xmath27 obtained with the field @xmath24 and a pair @xmath31 that is chosen randomly , we look for the operators @xmath164 and @xmath165 that solve the control problem associated to the field @xmath166 and the target @xmath27 .",
    "+ the direct use of the newton method of section  [ sec : fpm ] does not work : in this case , the algorithm does not converge .",
    "the continuation method enables to solve this problem . using @xmath167 , and 10 iterations of the newton method as inner loop",
