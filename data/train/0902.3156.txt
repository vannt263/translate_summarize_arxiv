    "the study of primary mass composition in the energy range @xmath5 ev is of crucial importance for the understanding of the origin of cosmic rays and of their propagation in the galaxy .",
    "the change from light to heavier composition with growing energy marks the energy limit of cosmic ray acceleration in galactic sources ( sn remnants ) , and of the galactic containment . an opposite change from heavy to light composition at higher energy would testify the transition from galactic to extragalactic sources .",
    "both changes are expected in the energy range of interest in the present investigation . to study the mean composition we use the relation between the logarithm of mass @xmath6 and the depth @xmath2 of the extensive air shower ( eas ) maximum : @xmath7  which is well - known from electromagnetic cascade theory .",
    "@xmath2 is derived for every event from the steepness of the atmospheric cherenkov light lateral distribution function ( ldf ) .",
    "we extend here the simplest method of performing such analysis ( i.e. of relating the average @xmath8 and @xmath9 values ) to the more correct one based on the analysis of the whole @xmath2 distribution .",
    "we summarize the results of the analysis of the tunka-25 experiment , based on 25 stations covering an area of 0.1 km@xmath3 , and therefore tuned to operate between @xmath10 and @xmath11 ev .",
    "both quoted methods show the beginning of composition change from light to heavy at energies above @xmath12 ev . to extend the study to higher energies , higher statistics and",
    "consequently larger sensitive areas and solid angles are needed .",
    "such an array , tunka-133 ( 1 km@xmath3 area ) is now under construction close to its predecessor tunka-25 .",
    "last winter the first part of the new array operated for about during clean moonless nights .",
    "the first results and perspectives of the new array are presented .",
    "the detailed description of the tunka-25 experiment and the procedure of primary energy measurement and @xmath2 analysis from the ldf steepness is given in @xcite .",
    "the methods developed for the analysis provided the relative accuracy of energy to be @xmath1315% and the error of @xmath2 less than 30 g / cm@xmath3 .    , vs. primary energy @xmath15 ( 7632 points).,width=283 ]    , distribution for @xmath16 . line ",

    "simulation for the complex mass composition containing @xmath1370% of light ( p+he ) and @xmath1330% of heavy ( cno+iron ) nuclei , width=283 ]    the experimental plot of the depth of the shower maximum vs. primary energy @xmath15 is shown in fig .",
    "data points are reported for energy @xmath17 ev at zenith angles @xmath18 and for @xmath19 ev at @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , the analysis of possible distortions of the distribution has shown that no systematic errors are introduced in such energy - angular ranges .",
    "the distributions inside narrow logarithmic energy bins ( 0.1 ) have been analyzed .",
    "the analysis was done as follows .",
    "the experimental @xmath2 distribution is compared with the simulated one .",
    "the simulated distribution is constructed from 4 partial distributions for different nuclei groups ",
    "p , he , cno and fe .",
    "partial distributions are simulated with a `` model of experiment '' code assuming the qgsjet-01 model of primary interaction .",
    "the code itself includes all the essential parameter correlations and distributions extracted from corsika and takes into account all the apparatus errors and selection of events .",
    "a detailed description of this code is given in @xcite .",
    "the weight of each group is selected for the best fit of the experimental distribution .",
    "the result for one of the logarithmic bins is shown in fig .",
    "we note that qgsjet-01 provides the best fit of the left edge of the distribution when compared with the other models . in principle",
    "the result of this procedure can give the relative weight of each group of nuclei within the total composition .",
    "but limited statistics and the relatively large width of the partial distribution make it almost impossible to distinguish 2 components inside the light ( proton+helium ) and the heavy ( cno+iron ) groups .        a more stable solution can be obtained for the percentage of light ( p+he ) and heavy ( cno+iron ) nuclei in the primary composition , that provides a stable estimation of the mean logarithmic mass @xmath9 .",
    "the obtained experimental dependence of @xmath9 on primary energy @xmath15 is shown in fig .",
    "3 , together with a theoretical curve derived from @xcite .",
    "one sees that the old method of interpolation shifts @xmath9 systematically by about 0.25 towards heavier composition , compared to the more strict method of the analysis of the full distribution .",
    "the mean value obtained with the second method for the knee range of energies ( @xmath10 ev ) is close to that obtained in the recent balloon experiments for energy about 10 tev @xcite .",
    "the rise of @xmath9 for energies above @xmath12 ev is well visible .",
    "to study the mass composition behavior in the energy range @xmath21 ev , the new array tunka-133 is under construction @xcite .",
    "the array will consist of 133 detectors grouped into 19 clusters each composed of 7 detectors .",
    "the map of the array is shown in fig .",
    "4 . the new array provides much more information than the previous one .",
    "each detector signal is digitized by an fadc with time step 5 ns .",
    "so the waveform of every pulse is recorded , together with the preceding noise , as a total record of 5 @xmath22 duration .",
    "the minimal pulse fwhm is about 20 ns and the dynamic range of amplitude measurement about @xmath23 .",
    "the latter is achieved by means of two channels for each detector extracting the signals from the anode and an intermediate dynode of the pmt with different additional amplification factors .",
    "four clusters operated last winter between november and april .",
    "data have been recorded over 270 hours during clean moonless nights .",
    "the average trigger rate was about 0.3 hz , the number of the registered events was about @xmath24 .",
    "the program of calibration and reconstruction of eas parameters consists of three main blocks .",
    "the first block analyzes the primary data records for each cherenkov light detector and derives three main parameters of the pulse : front delay at a level 0.25 of the maximum amplitude ( @xmath25 ) , pulse area ( @xmath26 ) and full width on half - maximum fwhm@xmath27 .",
    "the second block of codes combines the data of different clusters and provides the relative time and amplitude calibration .",
    "data from various clusters are merged to one event , if the time difference for cluster triggers is less than 2 @xmath22 .",
    "the time and amplitude calibration procedure is the same described in @xcite .",
    "the third block of programs reconstructs the eas core location , primary energy and depth of shower maximum .",
    "the first method of eas core location reconstruction is based on the fitting of the @xmath26 data by the lateral distribution function ( ldf ) with varied parameters of steepness ( @xmath28 ) and light density at a core distance 175 m ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this function was first suggested by the members of our collaboration in @xcite , and it is modified here to include large distance measurements : @xmath30 , @xmath31    here @xmath32 is the core distance ( in meters ) , @xmath33 is a parameter of the first branch of ldf , @xmath34 is the distance of the first change of ldf , @xmath35 is the light flux at the distance @xmath34 .",
    "the second change occurs at the core distance 200 m , @xmath36 is the parameter of the third branch .",
    "this branch is checked till the distance 700 m with corsika simulated events .",
    "these 4 variables are strictly connected with two main parameters of the ldf  density at 175 m @xmath29 and steepness @xmath28 : @xmath37              in addition to the traditional method above described , a new method of eas reconstruction using cherenkov light pulse fwhm has been designed and included into the analysis . to fit the experimental fwhm@xmath27 ,",
    "the empirical width - distance function ( wdf ) is used .",
    "it has a very simple analytic form ( for fwhm @xmath38 20 ns and @xmath39 m ) : @xmath40    fwhm(400 ) is related to the depth of eas maximum @xmath2 , that will therefore be reconstructed for each event by two independent methods : from the ldf steepness @xmath28 and the parameter fwhm(400 ) .",
    "an example of a reconstructed shower is presented in fig .",
    "the ldf and wdf for this event are shown in fig .",
    "6 and 7 , respectively .",
    "the absence of fwhm random fluctuations and a simpler expression for the wdf with respect to the ldf one seems to allow us applying the new method of eas core reconstruction not only inside , but also outside the array geometry , up to a certain distance .    a similar idea of reconstruction of eas core distance using pulse width",
    "was suggested many years ago by john linsley @xcite .",
    "but the use of the idea for charged particle detectors is problematic because of essential random fluctuations of the signal form .",
    "figure 7 shows that in case of cherenkov light random fluctuations do not play an essential role .",
    "we realize that before using such method of core reconstruction , a detailed study of wdf up to core distances 1000  1500 m has to be performed not only with simulation but also experimentally .",
    "a positive result of this study would let us expand the sensitive area of the array by 5  10 times compared with the geometrical area covered by the detectors for energies above .",
    "such sensitive area increase will provide 20  30 events with energies above @xmath4 ev during one year ( 400 h during clear moonless nights ) of observation and ensure an overlapping of the tunka-133 energy range with that of huge installations such as auger .",
    "\\1 . the analysis of @xmath2 distribution obtained with tunka-25 array provides the mean logarithmic mass of primary cosmic rays . for the energy range @xmath41",
    "ev it is close to that obtained in balloon experiments for energies around @xmath42 ev and corresponds to a `` light '' composition @xmath1370% of p+he and @xmath1330% of heavier nuclei . for energies above @xmath12 ev a rapid growth of @xmath9 is observed .",
    "the preliminary results obtained with the first stage of the new array tunka-133 show unique possibilities of the new apparatus recording pulse waveform for each detector .",
    "this will provide more reliable measurement of @xmath2 with two methods in each individual event .",
    "the completion of tunka-133 with its projected area of 1 km@xmath3 , together with the development of the new method of shower core reconstruction from pulse durations , will provide the reliable evaluation of @xmath9 up to @xmath4 ev ."
