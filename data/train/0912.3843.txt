    "the _ minimal spanning tree",
    "_ ( mst ) is a _ topometric _",
    "algorithm useful for searching clusters in a field of points ( or _ nodes _ ) .",
    "it was used by our group for detecting clusters of photons in @xmath0-ray images to obtain a list of candidate sources for the 11-month lat catalog .",
    "the application of mst to lat images , however , is not straightforward and presents some problems , two of which are discussed in this contribution .",
    "the first problem concerns the accuracy of the source coordinates derived from mst , relevant for a safe identification of possible counterparts of @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "the second problem is that of estimating the significance of detection of the `` selected '' source candidates .",
    "we first present a short review of mst : for a more complete description see campana et al .",
    "( 2008)@xcite .    given a set of @xmath1 points , or _",
    "nodes _ ia a multidimensional space , we can compute the set @xmath2 of weighted _ edges _ connecting them : the mst ( zahn , 1971)@xcite is the tree ( i.e. a graph without closed loops ) connecting all the nodes with the minimum total weight @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "for a set of points in a cartesian frame , the edges are the lines joining the nodes , weighted by their length .",
    "we divided the lat sky in a few regions to take into account the presence of the galactic emission and considered the photon arrival directions as nodes in a bi - dimensional graph , the edge weight being the angular distance between them .",
    "then we computed for each region the mst by means of the prim algorithm , that grows a tree connecting in succession the nearest neighbour of each node already in the tree ,    starting from one in the photon list .",
    "1 shows a field of the lat sky , at energies higher than 4 gev , with the mst that connects the events positions .    to extract _ only _ the locations where the photons clusterize",
    ", the following operations can be performed : @xmath4 _ separation : _ remove all the edges having a length @xmath5 , the separation value , defined in units of the mean edge length @xmath6 in the mst ; we obtain thus a set of disconnected sub - trees ; @xmath7 _ elimination : _ remove all the sub - trees having a number of nodes @xmath8 : so we remove small casual clusters of photons , leaving only the clusters having a size over the expected flux limit . after the application of these filters ,",
    "the remaining set sub - trees @xmath9 provides a first list of candidate @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "campana et al .",
    "( 2008)@xcite considered two quantities useful to evaluate the `` goodness '' of the clusters selected by mst : the number of nodes in the cluster @xmath10 and the _ clustering parameter _",
    "@xmath11 , defined as the ratio between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the mean length of the @xmath14-th cluster edges .",
    "the practical application suggested the use , instead of @xmath10 , of the quantity defined as @xmath15 , that we named _ magnitude _ , that combines the effects of the number of nodes with their clustering .",
    "the mst is a 1-dimensional structure embedded in a 2 ( or more)-dimensional space and therefore it can produce poor and not symmetric clusters around the centroid and elongated along the local tree direction .",
    "this pattern does not fit the instrumental psf and these clusters can not be accepted as genuine candidates of @xmath0-ray sources . optimized criteria to rule out these clusters have to be used .",
    "a good estimate of the sources positions in the sky is very important for the identification of possible counterparts .",
    "the simple aritmetic mean of the coordinates of all photons belonging to a selected cluster can fail to provide a satisfactory location for different reasons : ( _ i _ ) the cluster is in a relatively high background region and it extends in a particular direction with some nodes well outside the psf ; ( _ ii _ ) connection and/or proximity with another cluster ; ( _ iii _ ) small number of nodes ; ( _ iv _ ) high number of nodes but moderate clustering .    the estimate of the cluster centroids can be improved by using suitable `` weights '' in averaging the coordinates of the nodes or to select the nodes to be used .",
    "we used some different approaches and verified the one producing the smallest differences with respect to a sample of 150 sources in the 11 month lat catalog positions , chosen with different number of photons and clustering .",
    "the adopted weights for the photon coordinates were : @xmath4 the inverse of a power of the distance to the nearest photon ; @xmath7 elimination of some of the most distant photons from the first centroid .",
    "the mean angular difference between the lat catalog positions ( used as reference ) and those of the mst clusters in the considered sample was 0@xmath16.111 .",
    "the application of the inverse square distance weight gave reduced the mean difference to 0@xmath16.081 while the latter of the above methods gave a slightly greater value around 0@xmath16.095 .",
    "the chosen solution , also convenient for computational time , was that of weighting the distances with power of @xmath17 equal to 2 .",
    "campana et al . ( 2008)@xcite studied the probability distributions of @xmath18 and @xmath19 in uniform random fields generated by a montecarlo extraction of nodes . a straightforward application of these results to the real sky , however",
    ", does not give good estimates of the probability @xmath20 of a chance detection , because of the presence of sources and of the galactic emission , responsible of a not uniform @xmath0-ray background over large spatial scales even at high energies .    to have a more performing significance estimate",
    ", we adopted the strategy of _ localized _ montecarlo extractions .",
    "the wide field over which mst is computed ( say , @xmath21 in galactic coordinates ) , was entirely divided in many small regions ( @xmath22 ) and in each of them we extracted a number of nodes equal to that of the observed events but having a uniform random position inside the small region . in this way we retain  the  initial density distribution over  the original field .",
    "the mst was then    computed for the entire field and clusters were selected with the same filters ; then we derived the distributions of @xmath18 and @xmath23 .",
    "this procedure was repeated many time to improve the histograms of these distributions .",
    "an example , where the distributions in the real field are compared with those obtained from the _ local _ montecarlo simulations .",
    "is given in fig .",
    "2 . note in the real field histograms the `` long tails '' at high values of @xmath18 and @xmath23 corresponding to the @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "the significance of a source can be estimated by the distributions of simulated fields .",
    "the portions of these curves for values higher than a percentile well above the mode ( e.g. 60% ) do not show a large dependence on the density differences and are well represented by exponential laws , as shown in the lower panels of fig .",
    "2 . applying a cut at the 95% percentile to both @xmath18 and @xmath23 distributions ( using the logic boolean or ) we made a strong selection of the clusters in fig .",
    "1 ( right panel ) : practically all small elongated clusters , the majority of them having low @xmath18 or @xmath23 values , were rejected .",
    "only 12 over 55 clusters are selected as possible sources and 8 of them coincide with sources in the lat catalog .",
    "there are few lat sources not found by mst , but they can have soft spectra and the photon number above the 4 gev threshold is too small to produce a significant cluster . finally , there are four selected clusters not confirmed as detected sources in the lat catalog ."
