    "would reach thermodynamic equilibrium with it , where the energy distribution is given by the exponential boltzmann distribution , and the system temperature is equal to the bath temperature .",
    "the temperature of an equilibrium system is manifested in various measurements that can be performed on it .",

    "all results are calculated exactly in the context of our model , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss the generality of these results to other driven dissipative systems .",
    "at its most basic , a dissipative system consists of a set of degrees of freedom , or modes of excitation , which interact among themselves and with the external environment .",
    "when two modes interact with each other , there is energy exchange , with some of the energy being lost to the environment .",
    "external driving may be thought of as the injection of energy into the system s modes from the environment .",
    "our model is constructed as a minimal model including these essential features .",
    "when two particles ( we shall refer to the modes as particles for simplicity ) interact they lose some of their energy and exchange what remains , and when a particle interacts with the environment it is more likely to gain energy rather than to lose .",
    "our model consists of @xmath5 particles with energies @xmath6 , with a constant interaction rate between any two particles in the system . in every interaction",
    "two particles from the system are chosen at random and their energies are summed . in the case of conservative dynamics ( analogous to elastic collisions ) this total energy is repartitioned randomly between the two interacting particles ( as in @xcite ) . for dissipative dynamics with inelastic collisions",
    ", only a fraction @xmath7 of the total energy is repartitioned between the particles and the rest is dissipated out of the system .",
    "thus , @xmath8 is analogous to a restitution coefficient .",
    "the system is coupled to a heat bath so that it may be maintained in a nontrivial steady state .",
    "the interactions are shown diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ fig : model_diag ] , and described in further detail below .     the possible interactions in our model : dissipative two particle interaction ( left ) and conservative system - bath interaction ( right).,width=302 ]    for conservative dynamics ( @xmath9 ) an isolated system ( i.e. , not in contact with the driving bath ) reaches thermodynamic equilibrium with the exponential boltzmann distribution for each particle s energy , @xmath10 , where the temperature equals the average energy per particle @xmath11 ( we measure temperature in units of energy and set boltzmann s constant to one ) .",
    "dissipative dynamics ( @xmath12 ) cause energy to decay , therefore we drive the system by attaching it to a heat bath , constructed as an infinitely large system of particles obeying the conservative dynamics described above , kept in equilibrium at a temperature @xmath13 . the coupling of the dissipative system to the bath is through conservative interactions between a particle chosen at random from the system and a particle chosen at random from the bath ( the system - bath interactions are taken as conservative for simplicity , however dissipative interactions may as well be considered , yielding qualitatively similar results ) .",
    "this contact is characterized by a coupling strength , @xmath14 , defined as the fraction of every particle s interactions with the bath out of all its interactions .",
    "unlike thermodynamic equilibrium , the dissipative system s steady state depends on the bath through both @xmath0 and @xmath15 ( see @xcite which emphasizes the importance of coupling details ) .",

    "the simplicity of our model derives from the fact that every particle in it is described only by its energy , as opposed , for example , to the @xmath24 degrees of freedom per particle in a @xmath25-dimensional frictionless hard sphere gas . by eliminating the momentum and spatial variables and using only the energy ,",
