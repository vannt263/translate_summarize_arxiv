    "the goal of a qkd protocol is to share a random bit sequence not known by the eavesdropper eve , between the legitimate sender alice and the receiver bob .",
    "the fundamental feature of qkd protocols is that the maximum amount of information gained by eve can be determined from the channel estimate between alice and bob .",
    "such a task can not be conducted in classical key distribution schemes .",
    "if the estimated amount is lower than a threshold , then alice and bob determine the length of a secret key from the estimated amount of eve s information , and can share the secret key by performing the information reconciliation ( error correction ) and the privacy amplification . since the key rate , which is the length of securely sharable key per channel use , is one of the most important criteria for the efficiency of qkd protocols , the estimation of the channel is of primary importance .    conventionally in the bennett - brassard 1984 ( bb84 ) protocol @xcite",
    ", we only use the statistics of matched measurement outcomes which are transmitted and received by the same basis , to estimate the quantum channel ; mismatched measurement outcomes , which are transmitted and received by different basis , are discarded in the conventionally used channel estimation methods . by contrast , watanabe _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that by using the statistics of mismatched measurement outcomes in addition to that of matched measurement outcomes , we can estimate a quantum channel more accurately , thereby a higher key rate can be achieved than the conventional one .",
    "however their analysis was only asymptotic , i.e. , they assumed that the number of sample bits for channel estimation is infinite .",
    "hence , for practical use , it is necessary to perform non - asymptotic analysis .    for non - asymptotic analysis of the qkd protocol , scarani _ et al .",
    "_  formulated a lower bound on secure key rate @xcite .",
    "other researches of non - asymptotic analysis was surveyed by cai _",

    "has enough generality , in theory it enables us to calculate not only non - asymptotic key rate based on the conventional channel estimation but also the one based on the accurate channel estimation @xcite for the bb84 protocol . on the other hand , in cai _",

    "@xcite , it was suggested that a lower bound on secure key rate shown by scarani _",

    "_ if it satisfies the condition of _ conservativeness _ , the security of the final key is guaranteed . specifically , even if _ one - sided interval estimation _",

    "second , we show the utility of accurate channel method on the bb84 protocol using finite sample bits . to do this ,",
    "we compare the non - asymptotic key rate based on the accurate channel estimate to the conventional one by numerical computation over the amplitude damping channel and the depolarizing channel .    we stress that the assumption used in this paper is exactly the same as @xcite .",
    "in particular , we assume no prior knowledge of channel nor channel model with the accurate channel esitimation , as well as its asymptotic case @xcite . in the numerical comparison in section",

    "@xcite on the bb84 protocol .",

    "in the conventional channel estimation , eve s worst - case ambiguity is calculated as follows .",
    "let @xmath144 be the worst - case estimate of phase error rate with confidence level @xmath58 , namely @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ one - sided ] ) , then eve s worst - case ambiguity is well - known value @xmath145 @xcite , where @xmath132 is a binary entropy .",
    "the sample size for the accurate channel estimation is about four times as many as that for the conventional channel estimation in our comparison .",
    "this is because we estimate the channel by using measurement outcomes only when both alice and bob choose @xmath5-basis in the conventional channel estimation . while , in contrast , in the accurate channel estimation we estimate the channel by using all measurement outcomes when alice and bob choose the transmission basis and the measurement observable among @xmath5-basis and @xmath3-basis with probability @xmath146 respectively .    in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , eve s worst - case ambiguities with the conventional channel estimation are computed by assuming that empirical distribution @xmath53 is equal to theoretical distribution determined uniquely by @xmath54 of each channel , because the channel corresponding to any @xmath53 always exists . by contrast ,",
    "in the accurate channel estimation , the channel corresponding to measured statistic @xmath53 does not necessarily exist @xcite .",
    "thus we compute eve s worst - case ambiguities by @xmath53 generated with the pseudo - random number generator , to keep fairness of the comparisons .    )",

    "moreover , `` conventional variational '' and `` conventional relative '' are eve s worst - case ambiguities with the conventional channel estimation by @xmath57 and @xmath87 , `` conventional chernoff , '' `` conventional moment , '' `` conventional klar '' are ones by the one - sided confidence interval using respective bounds ( see section [ section - bino ] ) .",

    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , we can see two facts : first , our proposed confidence intervals improve non - asymptotically eve s worst - case ambiguity over the conventional confidence region .",
    "the amount of the improvement by `` conventional klar '' compared with `` conventional variational '' is about @xmath149% at @xmath150 samples in both figures .",
    "klar bound is the larger than chernoff bound and the factorial moment bound , though the differences are small .",
    "in addition , since convergences of these bounds are faster than that by @xmath57 , we can gain a higher key rate for fewer samples in which key rate with @xmath57 is small .",
    "for example from fig .  2 , when the sample size is @xmath151 , we can see that the value by @xmath57 is about @xmath152 , in contrast , the value by klar bound is about @xmath153 .",
    "secondly , eve s worst - case ambiguity with the accurate channel estimation is non - asymptotically much higher compared with all values with the conventional channel estimation over the amplitude damping channel , for example from fig .  1 , when the sample size is @xmath150 , about @xmath154 higher than @xmath57 .",
    "however , from fig .  2 , the accurate estimate is the smallest over the depolarizing channel .",
    "observe that the accurate channel estimation ( with relative entropy ) gives the worse estimate than the conventional channel estimation with relative entropy , for all samples sizes over the depolarizing channels , though their asymptotic limits of @xmath155 are the same as shown in @xcite . in the authors opinion , this is because the accurate channel estimation has to estimate the larger number of parameters and the accuracy of estimate is degraded by the increase in the number of parameters .",
    "note that the number of parameters is 7 for the accurate channel estimation and 1 for the conventional one . on the other hand ,",
    "the accurate channel estimation gives better estimates with larger sample sizes over the amplitude damping channel .",
    "this is because the asymptotic limit of the accurate channel estimation is much larger than the conventional one , as shown in @xcite , while the accurate channel estimation also experiences the degradation by the increased number of parameters with smaller sample sizes as well .",
    "since the asymptotic limit of the accurate channel estimation is always larger than the conventional one if the channel is not pauli one @xcite , the accurate channel estimation is expected to work better when the channel is supposed to be non - pauli and the sample size for channel estimation is large .",
    "the accurate channel method non - asymptotically increases the key rate over the amplitude damping channel .",
    "thus , we should not discard mismatched measurement outcomes in that case .",
    "however , the key rate non - asymptotically depreciates over the depolarizing channel . on the other hand , in the conventional channel estimation , the non - asymptotic key rate shown by scarani _",
    "et al . _",
    "is improved by reconstructing the confidence interval for a channel using the one - sided interval estimation with tail probability bounds .",
    "one - sided intervals can improve the key rate in the following order of tail probability bounds : the variational distance , the relative entropy , chernoff bound , factorial moment bound , klar bound .",
