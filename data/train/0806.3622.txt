    "radiation condition onboard leo spacecrafts is determined , particularly , by the charged particles penetrating from outside of the magnetosphere .",
    "the measure of such a process in any given near - earth space location is a local geomagnetic cutoff rigidity value . in this work we assume , that `` cutoff rigidity ''   phrase denotes an effective vertical cutoff rigidity ( @xmath0 ) , which value is gained from calculated discrete penumbra structure by ordinary technique using white spectra ( for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known , that magnitude of @xmath0 and penetration boundaries position depend on local time and different magnetospheric condition - related parameters  @xcite .",
    "cutoff rigidity value s variations can be measured in experiments or obtained by some type of computation using earth s magnetosphere model . however , usual method for @xmath0 calculation is based on resource consuming trajectory computation technique  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we offer the method to calculate @xmath0 with accounting for local time and main empirical parameters , that characterizes magnetospheric condition , in any point of near - earth s space . for the applications where @xmath0 calculation is often needed ( e.g. transmissions for leos ) our method provides a huge speedup in comparison with direct trajectory computations .",
    "the only things needed for the method are the igrf rigidity in exploring point and rigidity attenuation  @xcite quotient s dependence on empirical parameters .",
    "the first one can be obtained using interpolation in @xmath1 tabulated data ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) , which is regularly updated for coming epochs . and the second can be obtained only once by using particle trajectory computations in corresponding numerical magnetospheric model . in our case",
    "the dynamic paraboloid model  @xcite of earth s magnetosphere was chosen for solution of the problem .",
    "we have adopted in our work the cutoff rigidity attenuation formalism  @xcite , which has already successfully applied  @xcite for transmission calculations using tsyganenko-89  @xcite model .",
    "the rigidity attenuation quotient @xmath2 in our case is calculated as @xmath3 where @xmath4 value corresponds the set of model parameters for non - disturbed magnetosphere condition , and @xmath5 is correspond to some set of varied parameters regarding to quiet ones .    as it was wordlessly postulated in  @xcite , the @xmath2 dependence on point s geographical position",
    "might not be taken into account because it is relatively small .",
    "generally , it seems to be true at least for @xmath6 gv with good enough accuracy ( error s order is about percents even for lowest @xmath7 in this range ) .",
    "hence , the approach of calculating a world - wide @xmath0 grid can be essentially simplified .",
    "the algorithm we propose for obtaining @xmath8 in given point contains 3 stages :    * calculating @xmath1 for the given point ; for practical needs , the interpolation in pre - calculated grid for some altitude @xmath9 is often used , it is especially easy when large amount of results is needed quickly .",
    "the formula @xmath10 can be applied to transform @xmath1 value to new altitude @xmath11 . * calculating a model - dependent cutoff rigidity attenuation quotient + @xmath12 by interpolation in pre - calculated @xmath13 database ( or by extrapolation if @xmath1 value is out of applied basic @xmath1 array , see appendix ) * computing the resulting value @xmath14    table of @xmath1 values for some given altitude @xmath9 is needed to be renewed every 5 years with new igrf epoch coming .",
    "values @xmath4 were obtained by trajectory computations using dynamic paraboloid model with parameter set @xmath15 $ ] ( sequence of variables is according to table [ t1 ] below ) . to compute @xmath13 database which is intended to provide dependence of @xmath16 on parameters and local time @xmath17 , we used the varying of all model parameters in wide enough ranges , comprising extreme , quiet and `` anti - extreme ''  parameter sets .",
    "the multidimensional grid , applied for this calculation , is presented in table [ t1 ] .",
    ".the applied parameter grid . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     values at the edges of this grid were obtained ( approximately ) from  @xcite .",
    "all calculations were performed for local time values @xmath18 and @xmath19 hours .",
    "technical details of calculations are summarized in appendix .",
    "let us now demonstrate some results of cutoff rigidity dependence on local time and model parameters , that have been computed using presented technique .",
    "fig.[f1 ] gives an opportunity to weigh deposit of every model parameter in resulting @xmath0 value for all points of noted above set .",
    "such case of partial dependencies is obtained by fixating all parameters as quiet and excepting the given one .",
    "note , that the role of @xmath20 as @xmath0 depression factor wanes with decreasing of @xmath0 , but the @xmath21 one rises rapidly .",
    "the weight of @xmath22 and @xmath23 seems to be not important for @xmath0 values , at any hand , in presented case of quiet basic values , because they result in @xmath0 changes that are comparable with the value of applied rigidity step size ( see appendix ) .",
    "contrary , decrease of @xmath24 effects in huge @xmath0 grow ( see also fig.[f2 ] ) .",
    "the effect of @xmath25 and @xmath26 here is clear but of moderate magnitude .",
    "fig.[f2 ] shows family of @xmath0 daily variations for three points having normal cutoff values of different order . for the first picture",
    "there are some hours where @xmath0 is negligibly small , so such a point can be accessible for particles of any rigidity .",
    "the middle picture demonstrates the effect of @xmath24  `` anti - extreme ''  setting , leading not only to very high @xmath0 mean values ( for this case ) , but also to the translocation of curve s maximum for time axis s positive direction .",
    "the upper curve on the most right part of fig.[f2 ] exhibits the insufficiency of applied step size for penumbra calculation ( see appendix ) , leading to the underestimation of @xmath0 value for @xmath27 , which causes an ambiguous interpolation results .",
    "however , this effect is rare and too weak to affect resulting transmission , for which calculating presented method was created .",
    "a `` gnarlyness ''  of some presented curves is due to effect of scarce grid , currently imperfect interpolation procedure and scale .",
    "it is does not sufficiently affect the results of applications where much of @xmath0 values to be calculated , because interpolation uses many @xmath13 values and their errors ( which are of order of @xmath7 step size ) are to be evened .",
    "extrapolating parameter values to out of grid ( but not very far ) is also possible and seems to be correct enough to get reliable result .",
    "magnetospheric transmission functions are directly connected with such tasks as leo radiation conditions evaluating and the interpretation of orbital experiment results  @xcite .",
    "because of their importance , it is necessary to be able to account for more empiric factors that affecting transmission . here",
    "we ll give some examples of calculated magnetospheric transmission functions for several ( quiet , disturbed and very extreme ) model parameters sets for iss - like orbit , obtained using presented technique . the essential note",
    "is that , unlike tsyganenko models , the paraboloid one is primordially intended to describe even very extreme conditions , as it is not internally limited by experimental data arrays .",
    "fig.[f3 ] presents some modeled transmissions for @xmath28 km @xmath29 circular orbit under different conditions for long mission duration , where all localities are averaged and transmission curve became smoothed . in comparison with additionally figured transmission , obtained by tsyganenko-89 ( t89 ) model with @xmath30 , it is obviously seen that the paraboloid model gives unapproachable for t89 results in modeling most extreme conditions .",
    "the method we have developing is intended for applications using intensive geomagnetic cutoff calculations , first of all for express magnetospheric transmission calculation for given leo missions , even under changing magnetospheric conditions during flight .",
    "test @xmath0 and transmission calculation , based on the presented technique , is available online by url http://dec1.sinp.msu.ru/vovka/riho ( a simplified version , where transmission calculation is allowed for only static conditions and circular orbits ) .",
    "current version of the method uses the igrf rigidity values table as basic ( in step 1 of scheme ) , although it seems that the best choice would be to apply some other world basic grid , for example , one directly calculated @xmath4 table with using paraboloid model .",
    "nevertheless , it does not understate the attenuation quotient methodology itself , because its drawback in our case is only correspond to relatively small systematic inaccuracies between conditional `` quiet ''  @xmath13 values and igrf ones .",
    "author thanks dr.nymmik for fruitful discussions on the topic of paper , and dr.kalegaev for the provided data and cluster computing facilities .",
    "here we summarize technical moments that are related to the performed @xmath13 trajectory calculations with using paraboloid model .",
    "vertically directed protons were test particles for reverse trajectory calculations of penumbra .",
    "fourth order integration scheme was used for it , with accounting for time changing ( hence , magnetic field ) during particle s modeled flight .",
    "the geomagnetic field there was superposition of igrf epoch 2005 field with dynamic paraboloid model ( version 2004  @xcite ) , with uniform field vector @xmath31 outside of the magnetopause , which position is natively given by the code realizing the paraboloid model .",
    "maximal flying distance was equal to @xmath32 , the particles walked it over during motion were considered as allowed for penetration .",
    "the earth was represented by wgs-82 ellipsoid with atmosphere layer at @xmath33 km above its surface , the particles which fell below it was considered as reentrant . rigidity step size for penumbra calculation was equal to @xmath34 gv . all calculations were performed for altitude @xmath35 km above mean earth s radii @xmath36 km for six selected points in northern geographic hemisphere with basic igrf rigidities @xmath37 gv .        shea m.a . , smart d.f . and k.g.mccraken .",
