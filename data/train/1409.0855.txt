    "following the recombination of the universe probed by the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) at @xmath7 , the universe consisted almost entirely of neutral hydrogen and helium .",
    "the first collapsed structures , stars , and galaxies proceeded to ionize the universe into the state that persists today @xcite .",
    "the faint galaxies that produced the majority of these ionizing photons are currently out of reach of modern instruments @xcite , so the epoch of reionization is a valuable indirect probe of early structure formation .",
    "the time and duration of the reionization process is still under intense observational and theoretical investigation .",
    "the simplest constraint on the epoch of reionization is the measurement of the electron scattering optical depth @xmath8 by cmb experiments , which determines the average column density of electrons between the present day and the recombination epoch .",
    "current measurements of @xmath8 are consistent with an instantaneous reionization at @xmath9 @xcite , but modeling of the reionization process ( e.g. @xcite ) and kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich effect constraints @xcite suggest that it should be extended over @xmath10 .",
    "more model - dependent constraints have been obtained by studying ly@xmath2 absorption in high - redshift quasar spectra , which suggest that the universe has been highly ionized since at least @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "recently , an observed drop in the fraction of broadband color - selected @xmath12 galaxies that show bright ly@xmath2 emission relative to @xmath11 has also been used to infer a substantial increase in the neutral fraction @xcite . proposed",
    "measurements of 21 cm emission from the neutral cosmic web during reionization are a promising probe of the ionization state of the igm @xcite , especially in light of recent advances in foreground suppression ( e.g. @xcite ) , but detection of this emission still eludes current instruments .",
    "the search for a definitive probe of reionization that is accessible to current or near - future instruments continues .",
    "@xcite ( henceforth c08 ) introduced a novel method to study the progression and topology of reionization : emission from the igm during reionization was first investigated by @xcite , although in the different context of recombination emission from the entire igm . ] ly@xmath2 emission from the ionization front ( if ) of a luminous quasar .",
    "while quasars are unlikely to have been an important source of ionizing photons during the reionization epoch @xcite , their ( rare ) ionized bubbles will be the largest coherent structures in the universe during reionization .",
    "c08 showed that the conditions within quasar ifs are ideal for producing ly@xmath2 emission . by definition ,",
    "the if is the narrow boundary between the neutral igm ( with a neutral fraction close to unity ) and the inside of the ionized bubble ( with a neutral fraction close to zero ) .",
    "collisionally excited ly@xmath2 emission is strongest when the number of hydrogen atoms equals the number of free electrons , which occurs inside the if .",
    "also , quasar ionizing spectra are harder than the typically assumed ionizing spectrum of galaxies , and the extra energy of the ionizing photons heats up the gas to 24@xmath13 k. this temperature is hot enough that collisional excitations to the first excited state are efficient , and a substantial fraction of the absorbed energy is released as ly@xmath2 photons .",
    "this ly@xmath2 emission is analogous to ly@xmath2 fluorescence of optically - thick igm clouds at intermediate redshift @xcite , but instead of relying on the static ionized skin of a dense system , the emission can arise from any part of the ( initially ) neutral igm as the if passes through it .    in their fiducial model ,",
    "c08 calculated the ionization and heating of a uniform igm with clumping factor @xmath14 by a quasar at @xmath15 and performed ly@xmath2 radiative transfer to determine whether this ly@xmath2 emission could be observable .",
    "the observed ionized region around a luminous quasar depends strongly on finite speed - of - light effects @xcite which are computationally expensive to include in a radiative transfer code , but they corrected for this effect by re - scaling the timesteps in their simulation depending on the speed of if expansion ( we discuss this method further in section [ sect : causal ] ) . in the end",
    ", they found that the ly@xmath2 emission would appear as faint , large - scale ( a few proper mpc across , @xmath16 several arcmin@xmath17 ) line emission with ly@xmath2 surface brightness @xmath18 erg s@xmath19 @xmath20 arcsec@xmath21 around quasars with luminosities similar to the population known at @xmath22 , which is just bright enough to be barely detectable with current instruments .",
    "we improve on the c08 calculation by performing ionizing continuum radiative transfer through an inhomogeneous igm . as we show in the next section ,",
    "the overall clumping factor of the igm is insufficient to describe the physics of density inhomogeneities in the if .",
    "we also include secondary ionizations by high energy photoelectrons , which significantly modify the shape and temperature of the if , and correct for causal effects when the if is propagating close to the speed of light .",
    "the net result of these effects is a substantial decrease in the expected ly@xmath2 emission , pushing it out of reach of existing instruments .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : analyticdesc ]",
    "we summarize a basic analytic model for if ly@xmath2 emission from an inhomogeneous igm .",
    "in section [ sect : numericalmethod ] we describe our numerical methods including one - dimensional radiative transfer and correction for causal effects . in section [ sect : rtresults ] we describe the resulting ionization and temperature structure of our radiative transfer models in addition to the custom cosmological simulation from which we draw inhomogeneous igm sightlines . in section [ sect : analyticmethod ] we introduce an analytic method , calibrated to our radiative transfer results , that allows rapid , accurate computation of the causal - corrected ly@xmath2 emission along an igm sightline and sheds light on the processes driving the if ly@xmath2 emission .",
    "finally , in section [ sect : lyaresults ] we discuss the results of our ly@xmath2 surface brightness calculation and investigate the detectability of this signal with current and upcoming instruments .",
    "in this work we assume a @xmath23cdm cosmology with @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "to build intuition , in this section we describe the basic physics involved in the ly@xmath2 emission from the if .",
    "in particular , we discuss the dependence of the if ly@xmath2 emission on the local density , which has not been addressed in past work .    for the conditions within a quasar if , @xmath0 k and neutral hydrogen fraction @xmath1 , the collisional excitation rate of ly@xmath2 can be orders of magnitude higher than the recombination rate within the ionized region ( c08 ) . to first order ,",
    "the intensity of ly@xmath2 emission from the if is simply a function of two things : the width of the if , @xmath28 , and the average ly@xmath2 emissivity within the if , @xmath29 .",
    "the width of the if is related to the mean free path of ionizing photons , or @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the effective ionization cross - section of ionizing photons within the if and depends on the shape of the ionizing spectrum . the average energy of ionizing photons within the if is a non - trivial function of the spectral index @xcite , but is mostly constant as a function of time .",
    "thus , along a sightline , the width of the if varies as @xmath32 .",
    "the ly@xmath2 emissivity within the if is a function of both density and temperature : @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the effective collisional excitation coefficient ( c08 ) . assuming a constant temperature and ignoring the details of the @xmath35 profile within the if , we can write @xmath36 . finally , we arrive at the density dependence of the intensity of ly@xmath2 emission for a uniform density medium : @xmath37 . in a scenario where the material within the if is at roughly a single density ,",
    "the ly@xmath2 emission is proportional to density instead of density squared , so the average intensity along a sightline will not necessarily reflect the overall clumping factor of the medium as assumed by c08 .",
    "the previous discussion assumed that the temperature within the if was constant .",
    "however , this is not true in general .",
    "the temperature within the if is largely a result of the competition between photoionization heating and ( predominantly ) collisional cooling processes . at a given radius from the source ,",
    "the heating rate is only a function of the optical depth structure of the if , which should be roughly constant with density , but the collisional cooling rate will scale as @xmath38 . a simple analytic scaling can be derived as follows : assume there is a fixed temperature to which the if would heat the medium in the absence of cooling , @xmath39 , reflecting the energy deposited by photoheating .",
    "the presence of cooling will reduce this temperature by an amount @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the time a parcel of gas is within the if , @xmath42 is the rate of energy loss to cooling , and @xmath43 is the number of gas particles .",
    "the time within the if can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the _ instantaneous _ velocity of the if .",
    "the velocity of the if is determined by the local flux of ionizing photons and density of neutral atoms . for a steady source and assuming constant density within the if we have @xmath46 . because @xmath47 as discussed before , we have @xmath48 . if one further assumes a constant cooling rate within the if dominated by ly@xmath2 excitation , @xmath49 .",
    "thus , @xmath50 . as expected , denser regions cool more due to collisions , and as the if slows down at large radii this effect becomes stronger",
    ". the effect will in general be much weaker than the scaling derived here because the ly@xmath2 emissivity is a very strong function of temperature and will not remain constant . we derive a more accurate scaling of the if temperature in section [ sect : analytictemp ] .",
    "the resulting lower temperature within dense regions further weakens the density scaling of collisional ly@xmath2 emission from the if .",
    "the next step is to consider the inhomogeneous igm .",
    "one way to account for inhomogeneities is to enhance the rate of collisional processes by a clumping factor @xmath51 which can be estimated by cosmological simulations .",
    "this approximation assumes that the region of interest covers a broad range of densities representative of the igm as a whole .",
    "this is likely reasonable for the large - scale roughly spherical extent of the if .",
    "however , along the line of sight to the ionizing source , the if is a relatively narrow structure : @xmath52 proper kpc in width at the mean density of the universe at @xmath53 for a power law ionizing spectrum typical of luminous quasars kpc at @xmath53 ) because the average energy of ionizing photons within the if is @xmath54 . ] . the intensity of ly@xmath2 emission from the if depends on this line of sight profile : when the if passes through a dense region , it becomes narrower , and as discussed above the temperature of the gas may also change . we will show that _ the if resolves clumping in the igm_. this means that a clumping factor approximation overestimates the enhancement due to overdense regions .",
    "instead , the average emission from a wider area that more broadly samples the density field will depend on the relative amount of time spent in low versus high density regions , as well as other effects that we will discuss in section [ sect : lyaresults ] . the amount of time that the if spends in a given overdense region of size @xmath55 will be @xmath56 . if one assumes ( as a simple toy model ) that @xmath55 scales with the jeans length of the gas , then @xmath57 and so @xmath58",
    "thus , the if would spend more time in overdense regions , but not enough to recover the @xmath38 scaling assumed by a clumping factor .",
    "to calculate the time - dependent properties of the if , we developed a one - dimensional radiative transfer model based on the method of @xcite .",
    "we assume a medium consisting solely of hydrogen and helium at their primordial ratios and a single steady source of ionizing radiation .",
    "the radiative transfer model solves the following time - dependent equations governing the abundance of ionized species as a function of time and distance from the ionizing source : @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 are the number densities , ionization rates , and case a recombination rate coefficients ( see , e.g. , discussion in @xcite ) ] @xcite , respectively .",
    "the remaining species are solved by the closing conditions @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the mass fraction of helium .    the ionization rate of species @xmath65 , @xmath61 , consists of photoionization by the central source ( or  primary \" ionization ) ,  secondary \" ionization by energetic photoelectrons @xcite , and collisional ionization by thermal electrons @xcite .",
    "the primary photoionization rate is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the specific luminosity of the ionizing source at frequency @xmath68 with spectral index @xmath69 , @xmath70 is the volume of a spherical shell of width @xmath71 at distance @xmath72 from the source , and @xmath73 is the total optical depth to photons of frequency @xmath68 at distance @xmath72 from the source .",
    "@xmath74 is the probability that species @xmath65 is ionized by a photon with frequency @xmath68 given by @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 is the optical depth of species @xmath65 in a given cell using photoionization cross - sections @xmath79 from @xcite , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "we include secondary ionizations by energetic photoelectrons as a function of electron energy using the results of @xcite ( henceforth fjs10 ) .",
    "the secondary ionization rate is given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 , the fraction of photoelectron energy that goes into secondary ionization of species @xmath65 , is calculated by interpolating the publicly available tables of fjs10 .",
    "much of the remaining photoelectron energy is converted into thermal energy in the gas through collisions , with photoheating rates @xmath84 given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the fraction of photoelectron energy that goes into heating the gas after a photon of frequency @xmath68 ionizes species @xmath65 .",
    "the remainder of the photoelectron energy is released as ly@xmath2 emission , but this emission is unimportant compared to collisionally excited ly@xmath2 that we are interested in .",
    "the calculations by fjs10 assume that all of the interactions of the energetic photoelectrons occur instantaneously .",
    "however , this is not actually the case .",
    "the timescale over which an electron with energy @xmath87 is depleted by collisional ionization of hydrogen is roughly ( fjs10 ) @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the density in units of the cosmic mean at redshift @xmath90 .",
    "we include this timescale in an approximate manner by suppressing the secondary ionization rate in a given grid cell for @xmath91 before the if reaches the cell . to ensure conservation of energy , the energy that would have gone into secondary ionizations is instead directed into heating the gas .",
    "we multiply the fraction of energy going into secondary ionizations @xmath92 by @xmath93 , where @xmath41 is an estimate of the time at which",
    "the if will reach the current cell and @xmath94 is the current time in the simulation .",
    "the energy removed from secondary ionizations is then put into heating by adjusting @xmath95 accordingly .",
    "this approximation causes the temperature and ionization structure to match the no - secondaries model at very early times ( @xmath96 yr ) . over the next few myr it converges to a model following the unadjusted fjs10 rates . a more precise calculation of this effect taking into account the evolution of the time - dependent energy spectrum of electrons would be ideal but is outside the scope of the present work .",
    "the temperature evolution is determined by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the total number density of all species , @xmath99 is the total heating rate , @xmath100 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath101 is the total cooling rate , and @xmath102 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the cooling rate @xmath101 contains contributions from recombination cooling from @xcite , collisional excitation cooling and free - free emission from @xcite , and inverse compton cooling .",
    "we compute the ly@xmath2 emissivity in a similar manner to c08 .",
    "the effective ly@xmath2 collisional excitation coefficient is the sum over all collisional excitations from the ground state that lead to emission of a ly@xmath2 photon , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the collisional excitation coefficient for the transition from the ground state to atomic level @xmath105 and @xmath106 is the fraction of transitions back to the ground state from atomic level @xmath105 that result in the emission of a ly@xmath2 photon @xcite .",
    "we use the updated fits to the collisional excitation rate coefficients of @xcite from @xcite and include excitations up to @xmath107 .",
    "the calculation is discretized into a series of spatial grid cells that , for computational simplicity , correspond to spherical shells around the source .",
    "the physical structure of the if depends on the density field , so to resolve the if equally well at all times , we define the resolution of the spatial grid in terms of a hydrogen column density @xmath108 .",
    "we find that adequate convergence of the ly@xmath2 emission and temperature structure is achieved when @xmath109 @xmath20 , corresponding to a spatial resolution of @xmath110 kpc @xmath111 . in order to avoid wiping out small - scale fluctuations in the density field inside of voids , we require that @xmath112 , so @xmath108 will vary somewhat in underdense regions .",
    "this converged resolution may seem rather coarse  the initial optical depth at the hydrogen ionizing edge across each cell is @xmath113 .",
    "however , the radiative transfer algorithm we use is well - suited to such optically thick cells @xcite",
    "and we confirmed that the temperature and ionization structure have converged .",
    "the integrals over frequency in equations ( [ eqn : firstion][eqn : heating ] ) are computed as a discrete sum over 80 logarithmic frequency bins from @xmath114 to @xmath115 for each neutral ( or partially neutral ) species @xmath65 ( h , he , he ) . in this sense",
    "we do not explicitly follow a single spectrum of photons but instead treat the ionizing spectrum of each species independently ( except for the optical depths @xmath73 and absorption probabilities @xmath74 which include all species ) .",

    "however , while @xmath116 is typically smaller than the light - travel time across the cell , it may be too coarse to accurately integrate the temperature and ionization state equations within the if , so we loop over each cell with a sub - time step defined by requiring @xmath121 for each species @xmath65 and @xmath122 .",
    "we compute the average transmission of ionizing photons through the cell during the sub - time step loop to propagate a time - averaged spectrum of ionizing photons to the next cell . with these strict criteria on the global and sub - time steps ,",
    "we avoid numerical artifacts ( such as , e.g. , the temperature  ringing \" seen in @xcite ) and accurately compute ionization , heating , and cooling within the rapidly evolving if .      the numerical radiative transfer method described in the preceding section",
    "assumes an infinite speed of light for ease of calculation .",
    "this assumption can lead to unphysical effects  most importantly if velocities greater than the speed of light .",
    "previous studies have found that the infinite speed of light calculation is an exact description of the if propagation when observed along the line of sight to the source , and that the rest - frame behavior can be recovered by a simple change of coordinates ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "we follow the discussion in section 2 and assume a simple physical picture for the if where it is a structure of fixed hydrogen column density @xmath209 , @xmath210 , and effective emission temperature @xmath211 that is a function of the if velocity @xmath45 and density .",

    "the simplest model for the temperature within the if would be to assume a fixed value . in the absence of significant line cooling within the front , that would be a good approximation .",
    "however , that is in general not the case , and instead , to first order as in section [ sec : analyticdesc ] , the if temperature can be approximated as @xmath220 where @xmath39 is the maximum temperature to which the gas can be heated while the if passes through it , which depends only on the ionizing spectrum , and @xmath221 is the time that a parcel of gas spends inside the if",

    "this model for the ly@xmath2 emission largely reproduces our radiative transfer results within a factor of a few and contains the most important physics for understanding the if .",

    "there are two dominant aspects to this .",
    "first , the effective number of ionizing photons from the source is increased due to the presence of extra ionizations close to the if .",
    "this is evident in figure [ fig : secondtemp ] , where the model neglecting secondary ionizations has not propagated as far ( the if is located at the steep decline near @xmath224 mpc ) .",
    "second , high - energy photons  pre - ionize \" the surrounding medium , decreasing the effective neutral fraction and thus letting the if travel faster .",
    "we have found that these two effects can be modeled by writing the effective number of ionizing photons as @xmath225 where @xmath226 is several percent larger than the actual value for the input source and @xmath227 is a free parameter of order a few percent per @xmath228 myr for @xmath195 .",
    "this simple model reproduces the size of the ionized region to nearly the spatial resolution of the input density field in most cases , once the new parameters are properly calibrated .",
    "while the first order if temperature approximation of equation ( [ eqn : basict ] ) is reasonable for small @xmath72 and @xmath229 , it completely breaks down when the if slows as it passes through @xmath230 regions .",
    "this is because the cooling rate is a strong function of temperature ( see figure 1 of c08 ) , so the gas within the if will not cool indefinitely at its initial rate .",
    "further intuition can be gained by approximating the excitation cooling rate coefficient @xmath34 as a power law in temperature over the relevant range and then writing down a simple form for the temperature evolution : @xmath231 the resulting temperature of the if can then be approximated by analytically integrating @xmath232 over the time a parcel of gas spends within the if , @xmath233 . assuming an initial temperature @xmath39 , the solution is @xmath234 for our fiducial set of simulations with @xmath235 , we find @xmath236 k , @xmath237 @xmath238 s@xmath19 , and @xmath239 .",
    "this best - fit power law cooling rate function is very similar in character to the input cooling rate in the radiative transfer model , suggesting that this simplified approach to cooling within the if is a reasonable one .",
    "the model described above does not account for loss of ionizing photons to recombinations within the ionized region . in most cases",
    "this will not be important because @xmath240 .",
    "however , sufficiently dense regions ( @xmath241 ) can remain substantially neutral and have residual optical depths at the hydrogen ionizing edge of order unity or higher ( see section [ sect : inhomogresults ] ) .",
    "the if beyond these regions will then proceed more slowly .",
    "we include this effect by reducing the number of ionizing photons available to expand the ionized region by the number of recombinations along the sightline , @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the case a recombination coefficient and we assume the ionized region has @xmath244 .",
    "the temperature of the ionized gas is assumed to be @xmath245 where @xmath246 k is an approximation of the additional heating due to the second ionization of helium based on the results of the radiative transfer model .",
    "this approximation for the igm temperature is very rough , however , as the gas in the full simulation does not remain at a fixed temperature but instead cools due to adiabatic and inverse compton cooling .",
    "fortunately , the recombination rate is not an especially strong function of temperature , so the approximation is not a particularly bad one . some of the systematic error in the recombination rate correction to the propagation of the if is corrected by calibrating the @xmath227 factor described in section [ sect : analytic2nd ] .",

    "finally , ly@xmath2 photons emitted from the if may be scattered by the foreground neutral igm if they have not had a long enough path length to redshift out of line center @xcite . for a photon emitted from the if behind the quasar , the path length will be given by the sum of the causally corrected if radius and the uncorrected if radius .",

    "in figure [ fig : alphasb ] , we compare the predicted plane - parallel surface brightness for a range of input quasar spectra with varying power law index and fixed @xmath295 . like c08 , we find that the surface brightness is sensitive to the quasar ionizing spectrum .",

    "second , while they included a causal correction factor to propagate the if at the correct speed , they did not consider the effect of this causal correction on the intensity of the ly@xmath2 emission ( section [ sect : causal ] ) . as discussed in @xcite , relativistic ifs",
    "are narrower than their non - relativistic counterparts , with a width of roughly the speed of light times the ionization timescale @xmath325  @xmath16  @xmath326 instead of the typical optical depth criterion .",
    "this further decreases the emission at early times .    our less optimistic prediction for if ly@xmath2 emission calls its detectability with current and future instruments into question .",
    "the results in the previous section ignored ly@xmath2 radiative transfer effects which decrease the observable emission by scattering ly@xmath2 photons out of the line of sight .",
    "c08 found that these effects amounted to a factor of 0.58 correction to the plane - parallel calculation , predominantly due to scattering by residual neutral hydrogen inside the ionized region .",
    "they also found that the relativistic motion of the if could reduce the emission by another factor of @xmath175 .",
    "thus , our simplified calculation likely overestimates the ly@xmath2 surface brightness by a factor of @xmath175@xmath327 . keeping this limitation in mind ,",
    "our fiducial value for the observable ly@xmath2 surface brightness is @xmath328 erg s@xmath19 @xmath20 arcsec@xmath21 .",
    "the expected signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) for an observation of a @xmath6 quasar field is @xmath329 where @xmath330 is the covering factor of neutral igm within the field of view , @xmath331 is the ly@xmath2 surface brightness in units of @xmath328 erg s@xmath19 @xmath20 arcsec@xmath21 , @xmath332 is the diameter of the telescope , @xmath333 is the atmospheric transmission , @xmath154 is the system efficiency , @xmath334 is the spectral bin ( @xmath335 km / s ) , @xmath336 is the integration time , and @xmath337 is the observed area of the sky .",
    "the various parameters have been chosen to mimic an observation with the upcoming keck cosmic web imager ( kcwi ; @xcite ) assuming perfect sky subtraction and noise dominated by shot noise of the typical sky background between sky lines on mauna kea .",
    "this low s / n is in spite of the cold , clumpy igm from the hydrodynamic simulations which should overestimate the emission .",
    "similar observations with a future ground - based large aperture instrument such as the thirty meter telescope ( tmt ) could only achieve @xmath338 .",
    "an alternative observing approach would be to attempt a narrowband photometric detection over a wider area .",
    "the potential scale of the ly@xmath2 emission on the sky is a few arcmin@xmath4 , so the relevant @xmath337 can in principle be much larger than the field of view of kcwi or similar spectrographic instruments . in that case , for @xmath339  , @xmath340 , and @xmath341 arcmin@xmath4 in equation ( [ eqn : signal ] ) , we find s / n @xmath342 @xmath330 , which is only a marginal improvement if @xmath330 is comparable between the two cases .    the sky background at 1 @xmath100 m from the ground is dominated by atmospheric emission ( e.g. @xcite ) , so improved s / n could potentially be achieved by observing from space . above the earth s atmosphere ,",
    "the background is dominated by zodiacal light which can be minimized by observing a target at high ecliptic latitude .",
    "for example , the zodiacal light at 1 @xmath100 m near the north ecliptic pole is roughly a factor of 20 smaller than the sky background assumed in equation ( [ eqn : signal ] ) @xcite .",
    "this means that a space - based observation could potentially gain a factor of @xmath343 in s / n , though almost certainly at the expense of telescope diameter .",
    "if quasar if ly@xmath2 emission were detected by future instruments , the brightness would provide a joint constraint on the temperature of the if ( i.e. the shape of the quasar ionizing spectrum ) and neutral fraction of the igm .",
    "additionally , the redshift of the ly@xmath2 line would indicate the current size of the quasar ionized region , placing a constraint on the total number of ionizing photons emitted by the quasar .",
    "maps of this emission would allow study of the tomography of reionization  regions that were initially neutral will light up , while previously ionized regions will remain dark ( c08 ) .",
    "however , given the low expected s /",
    "n , this seems unlikely to be achieved in the near future . based on our calculations ,",
    "a detection of this faint ly@xmath2 emission would require a high degree of igm clumping on scales smaller than the if , a hard quasar ionizing spectrum , or some combination of the two .",
    "our investigation of enhanced clumping with a simulation of a colder igm in the previous section suggests that the former is unlikely . as for the latter , for a s /",
    "n @xmath344 detection with a thirty - meter - class telescope in 40 hours the target quasar must have @xmath345 , ignoring any additional ly@xmath2 radiative transfer effects due to the much wider ifs .",
    "five of the 100 sightlines we considered encountered optically thick absorbers , lls , within @xmath346 myr .",
    "once the if reaches the lls overdensity ( @xmath347 ) , the ly@xmath2 surface brightness plateaus as the if becomes a stationary ionized  skin \" on the surface .",
    "the ly@xmath2 surface brightness varies with lls distance from the quasar as @xmath348 , as one would expect for the  reflection \" of a fixed fraction of the incoming ionizing radiation towards the observer @xcite . while the surface brightness of the llss is much higher than expected for the if as a whole ( @xmath349 mpc@xmath350^{-2}$ ] erg s@xmath19 @xmath20 arcsec@xmath21 ) , the physical size of the associated density peak is only a few kpc across corresponding to @xmath351 arcsec@xmath21 .",
    "this could provide a modest boost to the integrated if emission , but as static features they will be separated in velocity space from the rest of the if fairly quickly .",
    "we stress that this is unlikely to be a very accurate description of the emission from optically thick systems because we do not consider the hydrodynamical effects of photoionization heating ( e.g. evaporation ) .",
    "these systems are analogous to fluorescent ly@xmath2 emission at lower redshift when the universe is fully ionized ( e.g. @xcite ) , and thus do not seem to be a compelling probe of the reionization process .",
    "however , detection of such systems may allow an independent constraint on the number of optically thick absorbers at high redshift and thus the mean free path of ionizing photons .",
    "due to the computational speed of the analytic model , one may envision a method to generate maps of the if ly@xmath2 emission by drawing rays through a three - dimensional cosmological density field .",
    "such a technique would undoubtedly be faster than performing the relativistic ionizing radiative transfer that would otherwise be necessary .",
    "we neglected to pursue this further because the expected signal is too weak .",
    "in this work we have explored the physics of ly@xmath2 emission from quasar ionization fronts in an inhomogeneous igm .",
    "our radiative transfer modeling includes much of the relevant physics and resolves the heating , cooling , and ionization structure of the if as it passes through a varying density field . in an improvement over past work",
    ", we include the effect of secondary ionizations by high - energy photoelectrons and properly account for causality in our infinite speed - of - light simulations .",
    "we have developed a relatively simple analytic framework that allows for rapid computation of ly@xmath2 emission along a sightline through the igm , and we applied this model to a ensemble of 100 sightlines through a hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "the resulting average surface brightness is a factor of 315 fainter than the prediction by c08 , reflecting both the smaller effective clumping factor of the ly@xmath2 emission and causal suppression due to the near - relativistic expansion at quasar relevant timescales ( @xmath352 myr ) .",
    "our analysis assumes that the light from the quasar reaches a completely neutral region of the igm within its lifetime",
    ". this may be unlikely during reionization because the presence of a luminous quasar indicates a biased region of the universe which will likely be ionized early @xcite . in a more realistic scenario where the quasar light does not reach neutral gas for @xmath344 mpc ,",
    "the ly@xmath2 emission would not  switch on \" until the neutral gas is illuminated along the light cone ( @xmath353 myr ) .",
    "additionally , the lack of pre - heating by hard ionizing photons could reduce the emission somewhat .",
    "thus , our results should be seen as optimistic",
    ".    there may be other significant sources of line photons at the very faint level of our prediction for the if ly@xmath2 signal .",
    "for example , scattering of non - ionizing quasar photons from the damping wing of the neutral igm @xcite could be brighter than the if ly@xmath2 signal . in that case",
    ", a narrowband detection of extended emission would not necessarily indicate the presence of an if , although one could still infer the presence of the neutral igm .",
    "the loeb - rybicki halo emission would be much broader in velocity space ( @xmath354 km / s ) , so a spectral observation could in principle disentangle the two .",
    "analogous to the hifs considered here , one might also expect hely@xmath2 emission from heifs during helium reionization at @xmath355 .",
    "heifs are relatively broad ( @xmath356 pmpc ; @xcite ) so in principle the if emission could be brighter . however , heresonance lines require four times as much energy to excite relative to h , so the temperature within the if is not high enough to produce any significant emission .",
    "the detection of ly@xmath2 emission from a quasar ionization front would be  smoking gun \" evidence of the reionization process ( and potentially a useful diagnostic of quasar properties ) .",
    "unfortunately , we have found that the largest existing telescopes fall far short of detecting our predicted signal .",
    "even the next generation of thirty - meter class near - infrared telescopes will struggle mightily to detect these ionization fronts at any reasonable significance ; measurements will require quasars with very hard spectra in relatively neutral environments and extremely long integrations .",
    "the smaller background in space makes a satellite observation easier , but collecting area will likely be a major problem .",
    "nevertheless , should the proper target quasar appear , this is an extremely powerful probe of the reionization epoch .",
