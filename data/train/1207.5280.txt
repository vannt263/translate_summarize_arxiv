    "the ngc 598 ( m33 ) galaxy is a low - luminosity , late - type disk galaxy in the local group .",
    "m33 is observed to be much smaller and less massive than the milky way galaxy , but has much larger gas fraction .",
    "it also shows no signs of recent mergers and no presence of prominent bulge and bar component ( regan & vogel 1994 ; mclean & liu 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , due to its proximity , large angular size , and rather low inclination , m33 is an excellent target for detailed observations of its cold gas , metallicity , the star formation rate ( sfr ) and stellar population , and thus provides an excellent chance for testing the model of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "the star formation ( sf ) law is one of the important ingredients of the model . based on the observed data of a sample of 97 nearby normal and star - burst galaxies , kennicutt ( 1998 ) found a power - law correlation between the galaxy - averaged sfr surface density ( @xmath0 ) and the galaxy - averaged total gas surface density ( @xmath1 ) , which was termed as the classical kennicutt sf law .",
    "later , observations of high spatial resolution ( less than kpc - scale regions ) showed that the sfr surface density correlated stronger with the surface density of the molecular hydrogen ( @xmath2 ) than with that of the atomic hydrogen ( @xmath3 ) and the total gas ( wong & blitz 2002 ; kennicutt et al . 2007 ; bigiel et al . 2008 ; leroy et al . 2008 ) .",
    "it was also shown that the sfr surface density is almost proportional to @xmath2 : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the molecular hydrogen depletion time .",
    "hereafter , equ . [ eq : h2sfr ] is called as the @xmath6-based sf law in this paper .    moreover , the gas outflow process may influence the evolution of m33 .",
    "garnett ( 2002 ) concluded that spiral galaxy with @xmath7 may lose some amount of gas in supernova - driven winds and tremonti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) also confirmed this conclusion .",
    "the results of chang et al .",
    "( 2010 ) indicated that the gas outflow process plays an important role in the chemical evolution of the disk galaxy since it can bring part of newly formed metal off the galactic disk .",
    "they show that the model assuming that the gas outflow efficiency increases as its stellar mass decreases can explain the observed mass - metallicity relation .    the chemical evolution of m33 has been studied by several groups in previous studies ( moll et al .",

    "marcon - uchida et al . ( 2010 ) compared the chemical evolution of the milky way , m31 and m33 .",
    "they found that the model predictions of the milky way and that of m31 were in good agreement with the main features of observations , while the model of m33 failed to reproduce the present - day gas surface density in the inner disk .",
    "the oxygen abundance was also overestimated by 0.25 dex in the whole disk of m33 .    in this paper",
    ", we build a bridge between the observed data of m33 and its star formation history ( sfh ) by constructing a parameterized model of its formation and evolution .",
    "a major update of the model is that we adopt the @xmath6-based sf law and this is maybe the first time for the model of m33 to calculate separately the evolution of the atomic and molecular gas .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the observed features of m33 disk , including the surface brightness , the sfr , the cold gas content and the metallicity etc .. the main assumptions and ingredients of our model are presented in section 3 .",

    "[ fig : diftau ] .    a clear property from fig .",
    "[ fig : abundance ] is that the m33 disk has a sub - solar overall metallicity .",
    "it is consistent with the fact that low mass galaxies have lower metallicity than the high mass system , following the mass - metallicity relation among galaxies ( tremonti et al .",
    "physically , the low metal content in low mass galaxies can be interpreted as the role of either the large gas accretion ( infall ) or the strong galactic winds ( outflow ) , because both can change the metallicity of the galaxy disk and gas fraction ( dalcanton 2007 ) .",
    "since m33 is a low mass system , we have reasons to assume that m33 is undergoing substantial galactic outflow processes during its evolution .",
    "motivated by various observed properties available along the m33 disk , we build a bridge between the observations of m33 and its sfh by constructing a chemical evolution model .",
    "we assume that the disk has been embedded in a dark matter halo .",
    "primordial gas ( @xmath22 ) within the dark halo cools down gradually to form a rotationally supported disk .",
    "the disk is basically assumed to be sheet - like and composed by a series of independent rings with the width of 500 pc .",
    "since radial flows are still in the stage of lacking a well understood description and will bring additional free parameters and uncertainties in the model , we do not consider radial flows in this paper .",
    "the details and essentials of our model are as follows .",
    "the gas infall process has been introduced in the formation model of the milky way disk due to the well - known ",
    "g - dwarf problem \" , which means that the simple  closed - box \" model can not explain the locally observed metallicity distribution function of long - lived stars ( pagel 1989 ) . recent observations , which were detected at 21-cm by westmeier et al . ( 2005 ) , also showed that the m33 disk is still in the process of accreting substantial gas .",
    "we assume that the m33 disk is progressively built up by the infall of primordial gas from its dark matter halo .",
    "for the given radius @xmath23 , the gas infall rate @xmath24 ( in units of @xmath25 ) is assumed to be : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the infall time - scale and it is a free parameter in our model .",
    "the @xmath28 are actually a set of separate quantities constrained by the stellar mass surface density at the present time . in practice ,",
    "we iteratively estimate @xmath28 by requiring the model resulted stellar mass surface density at the present time is equal to its observed value ( chang et al . 2010 , 2012 ) .",
    "the stellar disk of m33 is described by an exponential surface density profile and given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the stellar mass surface density at the present time .",
    "@xmath31 is the cosmic age and we set @xmath32 according to the standard cosmology .",
    "@xmath33 is the central stellar mass surface density at the present time .",
    "@xmath34 is the radial scale - length of the stellar disk and we set @xmath35 . the total stellar mass of the m33 disk is given by @xmath36 we adopt @xmath37 and accordingly we set @xmath38 .    in previous models of the chemical evolution of disk galaxies , the gas infall rate",
    "is widely assumed to be exponentially decreasing with time ( hou et al .",
    "2000 ; chiappini et al . 2001 ; yin et al .",
    "however , because of small initial mass of m33 , the disk may initially accumulate a small amount of gas and its accretion rate may gradually increase as its gravitational potential builds up , and then start decreasing when the gas reservoir is depleted ( prantzos & silk 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , we adopt another form of gas infall rate in this paper .",
    "generally speaking , the gas infall rate we adopted is low at the beginning and gradually increases with time .",
    "it reaches to the maximum value when @xmath39 and then slowly falls down .",
    "we emphasize that the infall time - scale @xmath27 is an important free parameter in our model , which regulates the shape of gas accretion history and then largely influences the main properties of sfh along the disk .",
    "it is well known that almost all stars form in molecular clouds , therefore , it is natural to expect that the sfr correlates more strongly with the molecular gas surface density than with the total one .",
    "indeed , studies of spacial resolved sf law show that the sfr correlates stronger with the surface density of molecular hydrogen rather than that of atomic hydrogen ( wong & blitz 2002 ; bigiel et al.2008 ; leroy et al .",

    "( 2010 ) suggested that it is necessary that the gas outflow efficiency of a galaxy may increase as the galactic stellar mass decreases .",

    "this is mainly due to the fact that , in our model , the setting of short infall time - scale corresponds to a fast gas infall process and high sf process in the early time of the galaxy evolution , and then leads to old stellar population , high metallicity and low cold gas content at the present day . to investigate the influence of gas outflow process on the evolution of m33 , the solid lines in fig .",

    "another interesting point of fig .",
    "[ fig : diftau ] is that the area between the dashed and solid lines almost covers the whole region of the observations , which means that it is possible to construct an evolution model that can reproduce the main features of the observations of m33 disk . considering the observed trends that the inner stellar disk seems to be redder and metal richer than that of the outer region , we adopt the inside - out disk formation scenario , i.e. , a radial dependent infall time - scale @xmath91 and a moderate outflow rate @xmath92 as the viable model , and its results",

    "we emphasize that although the accurate values of free parameters in the viable model are not unique , the main trend that @xmath93 increases from the inner disk to the outer parts are robust .",
    "in fact , this assumption is consistent with the well - known idea that the disk forms inside - out and has already applied in previous models of formation and evolution of disk galaxies ( matteucci & francois 1989 ; boissier & prantzos 1999 ; hou et al . 2000 ; chiappini et al .",

[ fig : age ] . it can be seen that the model predicts a decreasing mean stellar age from the inner disk to the outer region since the short infall time - scale means a large fraction of stars formed at early stage and hence old mean stellar age . indeed",
    ", the ground - based observations of bright stars in m33 suggest that the outer disk of m33 may have formed at late epoch and the sf process may be on - going ( davidge 2003 ; block et al .",
    "2004 ; rowe et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "another method to test the inside - out formation scenario is to measure the radial distribution of the mean age of the stellar populations along the disk .",
    "williams et al .",
    "( 2009 ) presented resolved stellar photometry of four fields along the m33 disk and found that the age of the majority of the stars decreases with increasing galactic distance , which is consistent with our model prediction .",
    "on the other hand , the investigation of stellar age distribution in far outer disk of m33 ( outside the break radius @xmath94 ) shows that the mean age of stars in far outer disk is young ( @xmath95 ) but the age increases with radius ( barker et al .",
    "2007 ; barker et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the explanation of the origin of this reverse age gradient in the far outer disk of m33 is still an open question and needs further investigations .",
    "the sf law is another important components of the model that may largely influence the evolution of m33 . in this paper , we adopt the @xmath6-based sf law instead of the classic kennicutt sf law ( that is , @xmath96 ) in previous studies .",
    "we compare the model predictions when using these two kinds of sf laws in fig .",

    "the results of kennicutt sf law are shown by dashed lines .",
    "other ingredients of the model , including the molecular - to - atomic ratio @xmath42 , are the same as that of the viable model .",
    "it can be seen that the solid lines are clearly distinguished from the dashed lines , especially in the outer disk where the cold gas surface density is low . comparing to the model adopting the @xmath6-based sf law , the model adopting the kennicutt sf law predicts much flatter gradients of metallicity , mean stellar age and color , while steeper gradients of @xmath97 , @xmath84 and @xmath0 .",
    "these results suggest that , comparing to the @xmath6-based sf law , the sfe of kennicutt sf law is higher in the outer regions of the disk .",
    "this means that the cold gas in the outer regions will turn into stars more efficiently , which will result in an older stellar population .",
    "indeed , previous works on the evolution of the milky way and m31 disks have shown that , in order to agree with the observed metallicity gradient and its time evolution well , it is necessary to adopt a modified kennicutt sf law , such as @xmath98 ( boissier & prantzos 1999 ; chang et al 1999 ; fu et al .",
    "2009 ; yin et al .",
    "however , why the sfe should be inversely correlated directly with the galactic radius is not fully understood .",
    "our results show that the model predictions based on the @xmath6-based sf law are more consistent with observed trends , especially the radial distributions of both the cold gas and the stellar population .",
    "in this paper , we construct a parameterized model of the formation and evolution of m33 disk by assuming that the disk originates and grows by the primordial gas infall .",
    "the gas infall rate is described by a simple formula with one free parameter , the infall time - scale @xmath27 .",
    "we also include the contribution of gas outflow . a molecular hydrogen correlated sf law is adopted to describe how much the cold gas turns into the stellar mass .",
    "we numerically calculate the evolution of m33 and compare the model predictions with the observational data .",
    "the main results of our model can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "based on the observed @xmath6 and the sfr , we estimate the depletion time of molecular hydrogen @xmath5 along the disk of m33 .",
    "it is shown @xmath5 does not vary very much with the radius , which suggests that the sfe of m33 is almost constant along the disk .",
    "we also show that the sfe of m33 is higher than the average value derived by leroy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) on the basis of a large sample of galaxies . 2 .",
    "our results show that the model predictions are very sensitive to the adopted infall time - scale .",
    "a long infall time - scale will result in blue colors , low metallicity , high h@xmath81 and hi mass surface densities , high sfr surface density .",
    "we also find that the outflow has relatively little effects on the disk stellar population and cold gas content .",
    "but it has great influence in shaping the abundance profiles along the m33 disk since it takes a fraction of metals away from the m33 disk due to its low mass potential .",
    "4 .   the model which adopts a moderate outflow rate and an inside - out formation scenario , that is , the infall time - scale increases with radius , can be in good agreement with the most of observed constraints of m33 .",
    "our results suggest that the formation of m33 is quiet and it may not form through violent accretion process .",
    "it is shown that the model adopting the kennicutt sf law predicts much flatter gradients of color , metallicity and mean stellar age and steeper gradients of cold gas than that adopting the @xmath6-based sf law .",
    "our results imply that , comparing to the kennicutt sf law , the @xmath6-based sf law would be more suitable to describe the evolution of the galactic disk , especially for the radial distributions of both the cold gas and the stellar population .",
    "we thank the referee for the suggestions to greatly improve this work .",
