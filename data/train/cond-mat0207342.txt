    "solidification processes in materials produce complex microstructural patterns in the interface morphology and composition distribution profile .",
    "the prediction and control of solidification microstructures are important because the properties of the materials are usually dictated by the microstructure .",
    "however the computational prediction of the microstructure has been one of the formidable free boundary problems .",
    "traditional front tracking methods solving the equations of motion of the sharp interface and keeping tracking the interface position in every time steps have been used , but appeared to be not suitable especially when the geometry is complex or in 3d . the phase - field model ( pfm )",
    "has emerged as an effective tool in describing the complex pattern evolution @xcite . in this approach , the phase field @xmath0",
    "is introduced , varying from one value in solid to another value in the liquid across a spacially diffuse interface with a width @xmath1 .",
    "the equations governing the phase field and diffusion field in pfm follow naturally from the definition of the free energy functional of the system and requiring it to decrease monotonically in time .",
    "in particular , karma and rappels asymptotic analysis @xcite at the thin interface limit ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 : thermal diffusivity , @xmath4 : interface velocity ) improved greatly the computational efficiency and made the pfm to be a quantitative computational tool under the real experimental conditions , even though their approach was restricted to the case of pure materials solidification with equal thermal diffusivity and heat capacity in solid and liquid phases .    several pfms for alloys @xcite also have been proposed . to use the alloy pfms as the computational tools that can yield quantitative results under realistic conditions , it is highly desirable to determine the parameters in the pfms at the thin interface limit , not at the sharp interface limit .",
    "as shown by almgren @xcite , however , karma and rappel s asymptotic analysis can not be straightforwardly extended to the alloy pfms because the unequal solute diffusivities and solute partitioning between solid and liquid give rise to anomalous interface effects ; chemical potential jump , surface stretching and surface diffusion .",
    "if the heat capacities and thermal diffusivities are different in solid and liquid , the pfms for pure materials suffer from the same anomalous interface effects .",
    "recently , karma @xcite proposed a new pfm for alloy solidification , which is based on i ) introduction of an anti - trapping flux in the diffusion equation and ii ) assumption of negligible solute diffusivity in solid ( @xmath5 ) , compared with that in liquid ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the anti - trapping flux could be manipulated to not only cancel out the solute trapping current across the interface at low interface velocity , but also eliminate all the anomalous interface effects simultaneously , together with proper choices for some auxiliarly functions .",
    "furthermore the assumption @xmath7 , as in the our previous approach of 1-d thin interface analysis @xcite , make the steady diffusion equation to be integrated without unknown constant , which enable us to find the relationship between the phase - field mobility and the kinetic coefficient at the thin interface limit .    in this study",
    "we propose a simple method for getting rid of the anomalous interface effects in the pfms , which can be straightforwardly extended to the multi - phases or multi - components system .",
    "the anomalous interface effects in pfms originate from the diffuseness of the interface in the diffusion equation , irrespective of the diffuseness in the phase - field equation ; they all vanish when the sharp interface limit is taken for the diffusion equation .",
    "furthermore , the interface width in pfms can be defined differently each other for diffusion field and for phase field ; @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "our approach thus is based on the decoupling the interface widths for both fields within the thin interface limit and pushing the interface width for diffusion field to be minimized .",
    "mathematically this corresponds to the condition @xmath10 , in contrast with the previous thin interface limit @xmath11 @xcite . in spirit , present approach is somewhat similar to the pseudo - front tracking method @xcite proposed recently , where the diffusion equation is solved on the sharp interface and the curvature for the gibbs - thomson equation is obtained from the diffuse interface . in followings ,",
    "we describe our approach in detail and then present computation results on the dendritic growth .",

    "the interface width @xmath59 of phase field is determined by the form of the double well potential @xmath18 in eq .",

    "a parabolic potential @xmath60 is adopted , instead of the traditional form @xmath61 .",
    "the parabolic potential is not new one , but has been used in pfms @xcite .",
    "comparing with the fourth order potential , the parabolic potential gives several benefits as follows ; i ) the equilibrium phase - field profile is given by @xmath62 .",
    "outside of the interface width @xmath63 , the phase state becomes completely either solid or liquid , which is contrast to long smearing of phase field into solid and liquid phases in the pfms with fourth order potential .",
    "this clear cut of interface region suppresses the spurious interaction between interfaces during computation on the system with complex interface geometry ; for example , when two solid / liquid interfaces are approaching each other , the two interfaces remains intact until the distance between two interface becomes less than @xmath64 .",
    "however , in case of the fourth order potential , two approaching interfaces interact each other with spurious long - range attraction and then merges easily into an interface , due to the overlapping of smearing phase fields at liquid between two solids .",
    "ii ) below we will introduce a highly localized @xmath40 form to minimize the anomalous interface effects . however coupling the @xmath40 with the fourth order potential makes the phase - field profile to be less stable in computation with increased grid size , compared with the coupling with the parabolic potential .",
    "iii ) importantly , the parabolic potential is more convenient in extending the phase - field model to multiphase - fields case than the fourth order potential , because combination of the parabolic potentials gives local maxima at the triple junction @xcite . indeed the multi - phases - field model with the parabolic potentials is extensively used recently for quantitative computation of the microstructure under the real experimental conditions @xcite .",
    "the interface width @xmath65 for diffusion field is determined by the function @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) . here",
    "we adopt a simple form ; @xmath66 this form of @xmath40 represents that solute redistribution or latent heat release takes place in a localized region @xmath67 within the interfacial region ( @xmath68 ) of the phase field .",
    "the @xmath69 represents the degree of localization , the smaller the value the more localization of solute redistribution .",
    "the @xmath69 value defines a new interface width @xmath8 with the relationship @xmath70 , and the width is independent of the interface width @xmath9 of phase field .",
    "if we take @xmath71 , then it follows @xmath72 , which has been widely used in previous approaches @xcite .",
    "all the anomalous interface effects become smaller with decreasing @xmath73 and completely disappear at the limit @xmath74 . in reality of numerical computation ,",
    "however , vanishing @xmath65 can not be taken as long as a finite mesh size is used in computations : consider 1d interface moving steadily in computation with mesh size @xmath75 .",
    "if we set @xmath8 ( over where @xmath0 changes from @xmath76 to @xmath77 ) to be smaller than @xmath78 , there can be the moment when the phase - field values on all the grid points are outside the range @xmath79 . during this moment ,",
    "the system loses the existence of the interface region for diffusion field .",
    "even though this phenomena does not lead to the violation of the mass or energy conservation , it plays the role of a very large noise source in computations .",
    "thus the best choice of the width @xmath65 appears to be @xmath80 .",
    "as long as we can not take the limit @xmath81 , we should take care of the anomalous interface effects .",

    "the second condition also can be satisfied by simply putting @xmath90 at @xmath91 .",
    "the last condition however is violated , as long as the conditions ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) are satisfied .",
    "how large the anomalous interface diffusion effect is in this case ? with @xmath92 at @xmath93 and @xmath94 at @xmath95 , the mass balance condition @xcite at the thin interface limit becomes @xmath96 , \\label{10}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the interface velocity , @xmath97 is the diffusion field at the liquid side of the interface . the second term in the right hand side of eq .
