    "the coherent states @xmath0 introduced by glauber  @xcite with respect to problems of quantum optics are eigenstates of the photon annihilation operator @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , their eigenvalues covering the entire complex plane .",
    "since the heisenberg uncertainty relation @xcite is minimized in coherent states , the latter are interpreted as the `` classical '' ones .",
    "the photon distribution function ( pdf ) in the coherent state is the usual poisson distribution , which is a smooth function with a single maximum near the mean photon number .    in nonclassical gaussian states of light",
    "the pdfs possess a number of specific properties related to the effect of quadrature squeezing @xcite .",
    "the pdf for one - mode gaussian states of electromagnetic field was discussed in  @xcite . in  @xcite the single - mode _ correlated _",
    "state of light was introduced , which minimizes the schrdinger - robertson uncertainity relation  @xcite .",
    "the oscillatory character of pdf for squeezed and correlated gaussian light was discussed in  @xcite .",
    "different nonclassical states of light might play an essential role in nonlinear processes  @xcite .    by using different finite or infinite sums of coherent states for a one - mode quantum harmonic oscillator various non - gaussian nonclassical states of light may be constructed .",
    "recently , there have been much interest in the properties and in the generation of so - called `` schrdinger cats ''  @xcite in the context of quantum optics  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these quantum superpositions of the finite or infinite number of coherent states have various nonclassical characteristics emerging due to the quantum interference between summands .",
    "the first example of such kind was constructed in @xcite , where the concept of the even and odd coherent states @xmath8 was introduced .",
    "these states satisfy the equation @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , they manifest such remarkable nonclassical properties as oscillations in photon number distribution , sub - poissonian statistics , and the quadrature squeezing",
    ". the methods of generating and detecting the even and odd states in quantum optics were discussed , e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present article is to study the photon statistics in another representative of nonclassical states : the `` real '' ( rcs ) and `` imaginary '' ( ics ) coherent states ( or `` real '' and `` imaginary cats '' ) . @xmath10",
    "the normalization constant being given by ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 similar superpositions , @xmath13 , were considered from the group - theoretical point of view in  @xcite , where they were called `` charged schrdinger cats '' .",
    "all the states of this family belong to the class of superposition states discussed in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the interference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 leads again to the non - poissonian ( modulated poissonian ) pdf .",
    "evidently , the statistical properties of real and imaginary cat states , as well as the degree of squeezing , depend essentially on both the modulus @xmath5 and the phase difference @xmath14 between @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "it is interesting , however , that the correlation coefficient between the quadrature components identically equals zero .",
    "we obtain the generating function @xmath17 of factorial moments @xmath18 , and use it to find the analytical expressions for the photon means , dispersions , and mandel s @xmath19-parameter .",
    "besides , we calculate the cumulants @xmath20 of the pdf and demonstrate the oscillatory behaviour ( essentially nonclassical ) of the ratio @xmath21 .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 was shown in  @xcite to play an essential role in analysing the particle multiplicity distributions in high energy physics , since in experiments it demonstrates an oscillatory behaviour , which is sensitive to the detailes of the state of particles created in high energy collisions  @xcite .",
    "for the squeezed and correlated states of the electromagnetic field this parameter was discussed in  @xcite . in the present article we concentrate on studying the behaviour of @xmath22 for the schrdinger real and imaginary cat states",
    "using the well known expansion @xmath23 it is easy to derive the corresponding expansions for rcs and ics : @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the vector of the fock space .",
    "the average values of the ladder operators @xmath6 , @xmath28 in real and imaginary cat states are invariant with respect to the hermitian conjugation : @xmath29 consequently , the quadrature operators @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( we assume @xmath32 ) @xmath33 possess the following mean values : @xmath34 for the elements of the quadrature covariance matrix we get @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 the last equality shows that both real and imaginary schrdinger cat states have no correlation between the quadratures .",
    "being rewritten in terms of @xmath5 and @xmath38 , the quadrature variances read @xmath39 @xmath40 the variance of the quadrature @xmath30 always exceeds @xmath41 . as to the quadrature @xmath31",
    ", it is squeezed provided the inequality @xmath42 holds . assuming @xmath43 to be small",
    ", one can expand the summands in powers of @xmath43 .",
    "for the real cat state the limit of the inequality is @xmath44 , for any phase @xmath38 .",
    "the analogous limit for the imaginary cat state is less than zero for arbitrary phase .",
    "thus , there is no quadrature squeezing in the ics when @xmath43 tends to zero . on the contrary",
    ", the squeezing in rcs exists for any @xmath38 up to @xmath45 .",
    "using expansions  ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) one gets the photon distribution functions @xmath46 it is obvious that @xmath47 , being a modulated poissonian distribution , is the sum of three poissonian distributions with complex means , which became the usual poissonian distribution with @xmath48 at real @xmath15 .",
    "oscillations of pdf are demonstrated in figs . 1 and 2 both for rcs ( @xmath49 ) and ics ( @xmath50 ) in the representative cases of @xmath51 ( fig .  1 ) and @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , @xmath53 .    the simplest way to derive the statistical characteristics of the field ( in particular , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) is to differentiate the generating function @xmath56 with respect to the auxiliary real parameter @xmath57 .",
    "then the factorial moments read @xmath58 the factorial moments up to the @xmath59-th order are plotted in fig .  3 for rcs ( @xmath49 ) at @xmath51 and @xmath53 .",
    "the plot of @xmath18 for ics at the same @xmath15 seems similar to fig .",
    "it is clear that in the case of @xmath60 expression  ( [ 17 ] ) tends to the classical ( poissonian ) limit @xmath61 .",
    "nevertheless , the pdfs in both rcs and ics dramatically differ from the poissonian distribution for all values of @xmath5 .",
    "this means , in particular , that the knowledge of a few of the lowest factorial moments is not sufficient to decide whether the statistics is poissonian or not . in the limit @xmath62",
    "the difference becomes clear only for the moments having the orders not less than @xmath63 . in the case of @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    "we have @xmath64 .",
    "the mean photon number equals @xmath65 whereas mandel s",
    "@xmath19-parameter @xmath66 is equal to @xmath67 however , in the case under study this parameter is not suitable for the analysis of the photon statistics , since for large values of @xmath68 it is close to zero , although statistics remains essentially non - poissonian .",
    "actually the equality @xmath69 is only necessary , but not sufficient condition of the poissonian statistics .",
    "more informative characteristics of the photon statistics are the cumulants @xmath70 to find the relation between the moments and cumulants note that @xmath71 thus , @xmath72 putting @xmath73 in  ( [ 21 ] ) one gets the recursive relation @xmath74 followed by another one , which is useful for the numerical calculation of the cumulant of the @xmath75-th order through the cumulants of preceding orders and moments up to the @xmath75-th order , @xmath76 in particular , @xmath77   k_2&=&f_2-f_1 ^ 2,\\\\[3 mm ]   k_3&=&f_3 - 3f_2f_1 + 2f_1 ^ 3,\\\\[3 mm ]   k_4&=&f_4 - 4f_3f_1 - 3f_2 ^ 2 + 12f_1 ^ 2f_2 - 6f_1 ^ 4,\\\\[3 mm ]   k_5&=&f_5 - 10f_2f_3 - 5f_1f_4 + 20f_1 ^ 2f_3 + 30f_2 ^ 2f_1   -60f_1 ^ 3f_2 + 24f_1 ^ 5,\\\\[3 mm ]   k_6&=&f_6 - 6f_1f_5 - 15f_2f_4 + 120f_1f_2f_3 + 30f_1 ^ 2f_4 - 120f_1 ^ 3f_3\\\\   & & -270f_2 ^ 2f_1 ^ 2 + 360f_1 ^ 4f_2 - 10f_3 ^ 2 + 30f_2 ^ 3 - 120f_1 ^ 6 .",

    "4 ( @xmath49 ) to demonstrate the fast ( factorial - like ) divergence of a series of @xmath20 . since the cat states with @xmath80",
    "are inherently nonclassical , the cumulants differ from zero even for small values of @xmath75 . their oscillating behavior is demonstrated in fig .",
    "4 ( @xmath50 ) .    the ratio @xmath21 may be used instead of @xmath19-parameter to evaluate how `` nonclassical '' is a quantum state @xcite .",
    "its oscillatory behavior in rcs and ics with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 is seen from fig .",
    "the strong decrease at higher @xmath75 is also seen : the factorial - like divergence of @xmath20 surpasses the quasiexponential growth of @xmath18 .    the high amplitude oscillations of @xmath21 for cat states with @xmath52 admit a simple explanation : while @xmath18 equals approximately the classical value @xmath61 , the cumulants @xmath81 .",
    "nevertheless , for large @xmath75 the ratio @xmath82 damps even for @xmath52 .",
    "note that the plot of @xmath22 for the imaginary cat state with @xmath52 is symmetrical to the analogous plot for the real cat state with respect to @xmath75-axis .",
    "we have shown that both real and imaginary schrdinger cat states manifest quadrature squeezing and non - poissonian statistics .",
    "the factorial moments of the photon distribution function have proven to be monotonically growing , while the oscillatory factorial divergence to infinity is observed for the cumulants @xmath20 when @xmath83 .",
    "the ratio @xmath82 has been found to be strongly oscillating for small @xmath75 and damping when @xmath75 grows .",
    "these properties confirm the nonclassical nature of the schrdinger real and imaginary cat states .",
    "if one considers the time evolution of quantum states in the case of a harmonic oscillator with unit frequency , then rcs and ics will be transformed as @xmath84 ( with the same complex exponentials in both terms ) .",
    "thus in the time - dependent case the complex parameters of the coherent states determining the superpositions do not preserve the property to be mutually complex conjugated .",
    "however , the phase difference @xmath14 between these parameters is time invariant . since the pdf is also time invariant , it is convenient and natural to choose the initial moment in such a way that the centers of the two coherent states wave packets would be located symmetrically with respect to the real axis",
    ". just this natural choice has been made in the paper .",
    "the multimode generalization of the real and imaginary cat states may be constructed analogously to the multimode generalization of the even and odd coherent states done in  @xcite .",
