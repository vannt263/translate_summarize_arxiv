    "in 1992 the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) technique in real space was invented by s. r. white @xcite and has been mostly applied to the diagonalization of one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum chain spin hamiltonians .",
    "three years later the dmrg method was redesigned by t. nishino @xcite and applied to classical spin 2d models . the dmrg method for the classical models",
    "is based on renormalization of the transfer matrix .",
    "it is a variational method maximizing the partition function using a limited number of degrees of freedom and its variational state is written as a product of local matrices @xcite .",
    "dmrg has been used for many various quantum models .",
    "it provides results with remarkable accuracy for larger systems than it is possible to study using standard diagonalization methods .",
    "the 2d classical systems treated by the dmrg method exceeds the classical monte carlo approach in accuracy , speed , and size of the systems @xcite .",
    "a further dmrg improvement of the classical systems is based on baxter s corner transfer matrix @xcite , the ctmrg @xcite , and its generalization to any dimension @xcite .",
    "applications of the dmrg technique for calculation of the thermodynamic properties in the 2d classical systems has been done by @xcite .",
    "treating of non - symmetric transfer matrices or non - hermitian quantum hamiltonians has also been studied by the dmrg technique @xcite .",
    "it was shown that drmg method yields very accurate estimations of ground state energy of finite quantum chains and free energy of classical strips of finite width with open boundary conditions .",
    "we have developed the dmrg method with periodic boundary conditions for strips of classical spins and shown that , similarly as for quantum chains , it gives these quantities with much less degree of accuracy .",
    "nevertheless , the dmrg method is mostly used for prediction of physical quantities and critical properties of infinite systems in connection with finite size scaling or extrapolation of the results from finite - size systems to infinite ones .",
    "the objective of this paper is to study the dmrg and exact methods with two different boundary conditions for finite strips of various widths and compare their results with known exact results for infinite 2d system .",
    "it is shown that while for the exact diagonalization of finite - strip transfer matrices scaling properties of the system improve , for dmrg approach there exists an optimum width for each degree of approximation . the developed approach is tested on 2d ising model .",
    "paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we mention briefly the dmrg for the open boundary conditions ; sec .",
    "iii contains the modification of the dmrg method for the periodic boundary conditions ; in sec .",
    "iv we present the results obtained by the dmrg method with periodic and open boundary conditions , the exact diagonalization method and show how to determine the optimum strip width for finite - size scaling , and in sec .  v the results will be summarized .",
    "the transfer matrix approach is a powerful method for exact numerical calculation of thermodynamical properties of lattice spin models defined on finite - width strips .",
    "if the width of the strip is too large and the capacity of the computer is exceeded , the dmrg method is found to be useful for an effective reduction of the transfer matrix size . it can be used for calculation of global quantities such as free energy as well as of a spatial dependence across the strip of local quantities , e.g. spin correlation functions .",
    "the properties of an infinite strip of finite width @xmath0 are given by the solution of ` left ' eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues of the transfer matrix equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a set of @xmath0 spins @xmath3 defined on a row and @xmath4 is a set of @xmath0 spins on the adjacent row .",
    "the transfer matrix is a product of boltzmann weights given by the lattice hamiltonian . for non - symmetric transfer matrices besides the left eigenvectors @xmath5 , the right eigenvectors @xmath6 should be calculated , as well .    reducing the size of the transfer matrix the standard dmrg technique proceeds in two regimes : ( 1 ) in the process of iterations , the infinite system method ( ism ) pushes both ends of the transfer matrix further so that each step of the ism enlarges the lattice size by two sites .",
    "the transfer matrix ( superblock ) is constructed from three blocks : left @xmath7 and right @xmath8 transfer matrices ( blocks ) and a boltzmann weight @xmath9 , in particular @xmath10}=t^{(j)}_lw_bt^{(j)}_r,\\ ] ] where the index on the left hand side denotes the number of sites in one row of the whole superblock @xmath11 at the @xmath12th step of iteration .",
    "the boltzmann weight usually is a function of several spins interacting among each other , e.g. for the ising model with nearest - neighbor interactions the boltzmann weight has the form @xmath13    in the first step of the ism ( for details , see @xcite ) @xmath14 is put .",
    "the whole procedure has @xmath15 steps @xmath16 and stops when the desired strip width of @xmath0 sites is reached .",
    "the first steps of the iteration scheme ( [ ism ] ) are exact but if the superblock matrix @xmath11 becomes too large , a reduction procedure , to keep the size of superblock constant , should be introduced .",
    "the first step of ( 4 ) introduces open conditions at the strip boundaries .",
    "if the temperature of the system is lower than the critical one and the strip width is wide enough , the symmetry of the system is spontaneously broken ( order parameter becomes non - zero ) , and after reaching the fixed point of the iteration procedure , the system does not depend on the boundary conditions any more .",
    "the calculations with periodic boundary conditions described in the next section give in this regime the same result as with the free ones .",
    "( 2 ) the finite system method ( fsm ) improves numerical accuracy of ism result by left and right moves ( _ sweeps _ ) according to the following prescription : @xmath17 @xmath18    in the right sweep ( 5 ) the left blocks @xmath7 are calculated in the previous step of the sweep and the right blocks @xmath8 are taken from the previous left sweep ( in the first right sweep from ism ) ; similarly for the left sweep .",
    "the values of local thermodynamical quantities given by particular superblocks in the final sweep ( after the steady state is reached ) are spatially dependent .",
    "the values given by the superblock in the middle of the strip @xmath19 are the closest to the bulk ones . in this sense ,",
    "the best transfer matrix eigenvalues as well as eigenvectors are those of the above - mentioned central superblock .",
    "the two largest eigenvalues are used for further finite - size scaling or extrapolation treatment .",
    "the translational invariance of the infinite lattice is preserved in finite strips with periodic boundary conditions when strip boundaries are connected with bulk intersite interactions . in this case",
    "the strip forms an infinitely long cylinder .",
    "if the radius of the cylinder is small enough , the model can be easily solved by exact numerical diagonalization methods .    in dmrg language , imposing periodic boundary conditions means that we have to introduce properly the connection of both ends of the superblock transfer matrix @xmath11 .",
    "thus , in distinction to open - boundary case the superblock is constructed from two boltzmann weights connecting two blocks at both ends ( see fig .  1 , the rightmost diagram ) .",

    "is enlarged to the desired size ; no degrees - of - freedom reduction is performed and the superblock transfer matrix remains equivalent to the exact one . as depicted in fig .  1 ,",
    "the ism starts with @xmath22 defined on twelve sites where @xmath23 , and one boltzmann weight , i.e. four new sites are added in each of further steps .    if @xmath24 , the number of degrees of freedom should be reduced at each @xmath12th step to keep the order of the superblock matrix constant and equal to @xmath25 .",

    "this procedure uses the left and right transfer matrix blocks to calculate properly the left and right eigenvectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , of the whole superblock for the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "once we have the @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the left and right density matrices can be constructed .",
    "@xmath29 @xmath30 and by its complete diagonalization @xmath31 sets of left and right eigenvectors stored in @xmath32 and @xmath33 matrices , respectively , is obtained ( analogously , for @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) . the indices @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) run over all states of @xmath38-state multi - spin variable @xmath39 and two - state variable @xmath40 . for the last steps of ism and all fsm steps half of the eigenvectors ( corresponding to their lowest eigenvalues )",
    "is discarded from the matrices @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and the information of the system carried by the density matrix is reduced . however ,",
    "remaining eigenvectors ( if @xmath38 is large enough ) usually describe the system accurately because the truncation error @xmath43 defined as @xmath44 is very small ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "@xmath46 , as the eigenvectors are assumed to be normalized .",
    "the matrices @xmath41 and @xmath42 enter the linear transformation as projectors mapping two blocks @xmath47 onto one block @xmath7 through the following procedure @xmath48 application to the right block @xmath8 is straightforward . as it is seen , we calculate the blocks @xmath7 and @xmath8 separately not using the standard mirror - reflection of @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "this procedure is necessary when dealing with anisotropic and/or inhomogeneous systems .",

    "is fixed ( the upper one in fig .  1 ) and the second one changes its position within the interval of @xmath57 lattice sites .",
    "the local physical quantities are calculated at the lattice sites of the fixed boltzmann weight and due to the rotational invariance of the problem are valid for all the rows of the periodic lattice .",
    "it is well known that the dmrg describes better a strip with open boundary conditions than that with the periodic boundary conditions @xcite because the precision of the largest eigenvalue of the superblock matrix is increasing proportionally to @xmath38 for open boundary conditions while for periodic boundary conditions only as @xmath58 .    however , if we are not interested in the largest eigenvalue of a finite - strip transfer matrix but in the estimation of the free energy of the whole 2d lattice ( per spin ) , it is more effective to use a strip with periodic boundary conditions than that with open boundaries , as demonstrated in table  [ fe ] .",
    "the results with @xmath59 practically exactly reproduce the exact values for @xmath60 .",
    "the estimation of the free energy for 2d models performed by dmrg can be improved by increasing the width of the strip . for a given @xmath38",
    "the best results are obtained for @xmath61 , but in this case , for @xmath62 ( i.e. below the critical temperature ) , the symmetry of the system is spontaneously broken .",
    "exact free energy per site @xmath63 was taken from @xcite .",
    "0.2truecm    [ fe ]    the critical temperature and the properties of the infinite 2d system near the critical temperature should be derived from finite - size scaling ideas ( as the finite - width strip is at criticality for @xmath64 only ) .    for calculation of the critical temperature , the phenomenological renormalization approach of nightingale @xcite have been used . here",
    ", the scaling properties of the correlation length , found as logarithm of the ratio of two largest eigenvalues of the exact or superblock matrix , are exploited .",
    "the product of the inverse correlation length @xmath65 and the strip width @xmath0 should not depend on the @xmath0 at critical temperature @xmath66 @xmath67    the accuracy of the approximate critical temperature improves with size of the strip in the case of exact diagonalization . for dmrg calculations",
    "this statement is no longer valid , as for very large @xmath0 the symmetry of the system spontaneously breaks , and the phenomenological renormalization is not applicable any more .",
    "thus , for given order of approximation @xmath38 , there exists an optimum value of the strip width @xmath68 .",
    "this can be estimated from the following considerations : for exact diagonalization or dmrg calculations with @xmath38 close to @xmath69 , the difference of the approximate critical temperature from the exact critical temperature @xmath70 @xcite scales with the width of the strip as follows @xcite : @xmath71 i.e. the ratio @xmath72    the optimum width @xmath68 should be less than @xmath73 for which the ratio of the derivatives @xmath74 ( [ scal ] ) is substantially deviated from the originally linear behavior . in our calculations we have considered the dmrg results to be incorrect for @xmath75 or @xmath76 . in the case of @xmath75 , the precise value of @xmath68 is not too important as the first derivative or change of @xmath66 is very small . near @xmath77 , a sharp drop of the second derivative of @xmath78 to zero is required ; indeed , the change of the distance from the line @xmath79 by more than one order of magnitude takes place within one step of strip - width enlargement .    in fig .",
    "[ pbc_obc ] plots of strip - width - dependent critical temperatures @xmath66 for two different boundary conditions and various block sizes @xmath38 are given .",
    "the estimations of the exact critical temperature for periodic and open boundary conditions were found as the values of @xmath80 if the first or second derivative of @xmath66 changed their signs with respect to the value in the previous step .",
    "the curves for pbc cross the exact value of @xmath81 .",
    "the curve maxima for obc are quite far from it , and by increasing @xmath0 , @xmath82 approaches the exact value very slowly .    the accuracy of the results for periodic boundary conditions ( fig .  [ pbc ] ) is very high already at small values of @xmath38 and exceeds by an order the critical temperature estimation for maximum computer - accessible @xmath38 when using open boundary conditions . the critical temperature for not extremely large @xmath83 is given to seven digits . as the width of the strip can be increased only in discrete steps and the criterion of the optimum strip - width is somewhat vague",
    ", the accuracy of the critical temperature determination should be taken as large as a single step change of @xmath66 .",
    "these accuracy estimations together with deviations of our results from the exact critical temperature are given in table [ tc ] .",
    "it should be noted that only ism was performed in calculations of @xmath66 in figs .",
    "[ pbc_obc ] and [ pbc ] .",
    "the calculations with the fsm has been also done near the @xmath68 but only slight improvements of critical temperature were obtained . in calculation of the thermal critical exponent @xcite a similar accuracy",

    "the dmrg method for classical spin lattice strips with periodic boundaries was developed and applied to 2d ising model .",
    "it was shown that this approach lead to more accurate results for 2d infinite lattice than dmrg with open boundary conditions .",

    "for the ising model it was shown by computations that for these @xmath88 the value of the critical temperature , was for a given @xmath38 closest to the exact one . as our approach does not involve any information about the exact critical temperature @xmath81 or the universality class of the model , we believe that it is applicable to many different classes of spin lattice models .",
