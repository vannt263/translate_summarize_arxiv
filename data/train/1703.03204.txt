    "the galaxy population can be thought of as bimodal , with star forming late - type galaxies populating the so - called blue cloud and passive early - type galaxies preferentially found in the red sequence @xcite .",
    "this bimodality is strongly correlated with the environment , with many studies pointing out a well established morphology - density relation holding in both clusters and the field : the higher the projected surface density of galaxies within an area , the higher is the fraction of early types and the lower is the fraction of late types ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this piece of evidence indicates a role of the environment in shaping galaxy properties .",
    "the detection of a conspicuous population of star forming galaxies in the core of rich and dense clusters at z@xmath50.5 , but absent today @xcite , was the first discovery of a strong decline in star formation with time .",
    "subsequently , several studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown the influence of high density environments on the formation and evolution of galaxies . in an evolutionary scenario in which clusters form and grow through the accretion of field galaxies",
    ", these findings suggest that there should be some active mechanisms able to halt the star formation in infalling galaxies .",
    "several authors proposed many different mechanisms able to shut down star formation in high - density regions ; examples include ram - pressure stripping @xcite , high speed galaxy encounters ( galaxy harassment ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , galaxy - galaxy mergers @xcite , and removal of the warm and hot halo gas ( strangulation ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite proposed that cluster galaxies could be transformed via group pre - processing , during the fall - in group phase .",
    "valuable insights to understand how the star - forming population turns passive can be obtained by studying galaxies that appear to have intermediate properties and may be in the act of transitioning between the two main galaxy populations .",
    "this transition can occur on different time scales depending on the main process inducing the transformations @xcite . however , a clear picture describing the reasons why galaxies turn into passive following different paths and the properties of these galaxies is still lacking .",
    "@xcite , investigating cluster galaxies at intermediate redhsifts , found a large number of spectra showing strong balmer absorption lines and no emission and called them post - starburst galaxies .",
    "these features are typical of stellar populations in which star formation had ended abruptly within the last 1 - 1.5 gyr and therefore should have been affected by some of the aforementioned processes .    since then , extensive spectrophotometric modeling @xcite has found that the presence of strong hydrogen lines in absorption and the concomitant absence of emission lines , indicating no ongoing star formation , can be explained roughly decomposing the spectra into a combination of k giant star ( or early type galaxy ) spectrum and an a star spectrum , such decomposition is at the origin of the name `` k+a '' , often used to describe post - starburst galaxies . in general , a type stars - i.e. new born stars formed within the last 1 gyr whose spectra are characterized by strong balmer absorption lines - dominate the light of a galaxy about 0.5 gyr after star formation stopped and leave their signature on the spectra visible for 1 - 1.5 gyr .",
    "in contrast , o and b stars - more massive stars that die very quickly and emit the energetic photons able to ionize the gas and produce emission lines - have no or very little contribution . this combination can appear as a result of a star - bursting episode observed shortly after the star formation has stopped ( for those galaxies with the strongest balmer lines ) , or as a consequence of normal star formation that has been abruptly ended .",
    "moreover , since a type stars have known lifetimes , the evolution of this population can be used as a quenching clock .",
    "the reason why post - starburst galaxies underwent an episode of star formation that was abruptly stopped is still matter of debate ; any of the mentioned quenching mechanisms acting on a short time scale could trigger a starburst and cease star formation , producing a k+a spectra .",
    "important hints for solving this matter come from the study of the galaxy environments as different quenching mechanisms play different roles in different environments .",
    "galaxy mergers could be the dominant mechanism in the field at low - z , where recent studies found a significant fraction of post starburst galaxies @xcite , but they are less effective in clusters , due to the high velocity dispersions .",
    "the origin of k+a galaxies in clusters is more probably related to the interaction of the infalling population with the hot and dense intra cluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "indeed , as suggested by @xcite , the interaction of a gas rich galaxy with the hot high - pressure icm via ram - pressure stripping might trigger a starburst and then clear the disk of neutral gas stopping star formation .",
    "the most striking evidence for this is perhaps in the coma cluster , where the position of young post - starburst galaxies is strongly correlated with strong x - ray temperature gradients @xcite . while this picture is corroborated by observations of high and intermediate redshift clusters @xcite , in the local universe several works ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) found that post starburst galaxies prefer low density environments and thus asses that cluster specific processes are not likely to be the dominant source of fast quenching .",
    "nonetheless , the few studies that investigated the fraction and properties of the local post - starburst cluster population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) found evidence of truncated star formation in a significant fraction of cluster members . a complete census of post - starburst galaxies in clusters and a homogeneous comparison with the field population is however still lacking .",
    "the main reasons are the paucity of the cluster samples studied and the different selection criteria adopted in these studies that do not allow fair intra - sample comparisons . in addition , local post starburst galaxies are often selected without constraints on the h@xmath6 line , to allow for direct comparisons with high redshift samples , where generally the spectral coverage does not allow to reach the h@xmath6 emission . however , as shown by @xcite and @xcite , such selections suffer from high levels ( @xmath7 ) of contamination from h@xmath8 emitting galaxies .",
    "however , most e+a galaxies at low redshift are located in the field and represent a very low fraction of the overall galaxy population ( 0.2 per cent ; zabludoff et al .",
    "the rarity of e+a galaxies at low redshift means that samples can only be constructed from large galaxy redshift surveys . as a result",
    ", very few local ( v < 5000 km s1 ) examples of field e+as are known .    in this work ,",
    "we exploit a sample of galaxies in clusters drawn from the wide - field nearby galaxy - cluster survey ( wings ) @xcite , and omegawings surveys @xcite .",
    "the combination of the two projects allows us to study the properties of @xmath9 member galaxies in an homogeneous sample at @xmath2 .",
    "this dataset is unique , as none of the other low - z surveys investigate a large sample of clusters and cluster galaxies in such detail .",
    "thanks to the wide area covered by omegawings ( @xmath10 ) , we can investigate cluster members well beyond the cluster virial radius and link clusters with the surrounding population and the field that have been proved to be essential for understanding galaxy transformations @xcite .",
    "we investigate the occurrence and properties of post starburst galaxies in 32 clusters and compare them to those of passive and star forming galaxies .",
    "trends are investigated as a function of both clustercentric distance and global cluster properties , i.e. cluster velocity dispersion and x - ray luminosity .",

    "we base our analysis on the wide - field nearby galaxy - cluster survey ( wings ) @xcite , a multi - wavelength survey of 76 clusters of galaxies with @xmath2 x - ray selected from rosat all sky survey data @xcite , and from its recent extension , omegawings , that includes new observations for 46 of these clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cluster samples cover a wide range of velocity dispersion ( @xmath16500 - 1300 km / s ) and x - ray luminosity ( @xmath17 erg / s ) .",
    "the wings survey is mainly based on optical b , v imaging @xcite that covers a @xmath18 field of view , corresponding to at least about a clustercentric distance of 0.6@xmath19 .",
    "r@xmath20 is defined to be the radius delimiting a sphere with interior mean density 200 times the critical density and is used as an approximation for the cluster virial radius .",

    "these criteria minimize the contamination from background galaxies and include all galaxies on and below the red sequence up to @xmath24 .    combining the data of the two surveys ,",
    "the final spectroscopic sample consists of 22674 spectra in 60 clusters @xcite .    to measure spectroscopic redshifts",
    ", we adopted a semi - automatic method , which involves the automatic cross - correlation technique and the emission lines identification , with a very high success rate ( @xmath25 95% for the whole sample , see @xcite and @xcite .",

    "r@xmath20 was computed from @xmath27 following @xcite and used to scale the distances from the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) .",
    "the spectroscopic catalog has been corrected for both geometrical and magnitude incompleteness , using the ratio of number of spectra yielding a redshift to the total number of galaxies in the parent photometric catalog , calculated both as a function of v magnitude and radial projected distance from the bcg .",
    "galaxy properties have been derived by fitting the fiber spectra with sinopsis ( simulating optical spectra with stellar population models ) , a spectrophotometric model fully described in @xcite .",
    "it is based on a stellar population synthesis technique that reproduces the observed optical galaxy spectra .",
    "all the main spectrophotometric features are reproduced by summing the theoretical spectra of simple stellar populations of 12 different ages ( from 3 @xmath29 to approximately 14@xmath30 years ) .",
    "the code provides estimates of star formation rates ( sfrs ) , stellar masses ( @xmath31 ) , both observed and absolute model magnitudes and measures of observed equivalent widths ( ews ) for the most prominent spectral lines , both in absorption and in emission .",
    "magnitudes were computed by convolving the filters response curves with the spectrum .    due to the configuration of the 2dfdr spectrograph , which is a dual - beam system with two arms overlapping around 5700  , for each object observed with this instrument we obtained two spectra , hereafter called red and blue , which are spliced into the full final spectrum . despite the quite extended overlap",
    ", the region of the spliced spectrum often results quite noisy , due to normalization issues .",
    "while none of the lines used in our analysis ( see sect.[sec : class ] ) fall in the spliced region , the sfrs and mass estimates in such region might be significantly affected by noise , therefore , we fit the continuum only on the blue part of the spectra , ranging from about 3600  to 5700  .",
    "hereafter , we will use stellar masses locked into stars , including both those that are still in the nuclear - burning phase , and remnants such as white dwarfs , neutron stars and stellar black holes .",
    "we note the sinopsis is fed with fiber spectra , ( see * ? ? ?",
    "] therefore all the galaxy properties suffer from aperture effects .",
    "the fiber diameters were 2.16@xmath32 ( aat ) and 1.6@xmath32 ( wht ) , therefore the spectra cover only the central 1.3 to 2.8 kpc of our galaxies depending on the cluster redshift , ( see @xcite for details ) , which correspond to approximately half the typical effective diameter of wings galaxies.1.7@xmath330.2 kpc .",
    "] to recover the galaxy - wide integrated properties , all the derived quantities have been scaled from the fiber to the total magnitude , using the ratio of total to aperture fluxes .    for the wings sample ,",
    "morphological types were derived from v - band images using morphot , an automatic tool for galaxy morphology , purposely devised in the framework of the wings project @xcite .",

    "we remind the reader that at low redshifts , the amount of gas necessary to produce a burst of star formation as a consequence of the interaction of the galaxy with the icm , via ram pressure stripping , is mostly located in low - mass late - type systems while more massive galaxies are mostly early - types and gas deficient @xcite .    similarly to the analysis of galaxy colors , the analysis of the morphologies shows that the majority of psb galaxies can not be recognized when using just a morphological classification , but a detailed spectral analysis is necessary .      in the previous sections",

    "a more detailed analysis of the dependence of the post - starburst fraction on the cluster global properties will be discussed in  [ cl_prop ] .",
    "considering the psbs of different morphological types , we find that overall the incidence of ellipitcals , s0s and late - types does not change with clustercentric distance , suggesting there is no morphological segregation for psbs ( plot not shown ) .",
    "clusters are generally characterized by the presence of substructures @xcite , which implies that merging between clusters and groups is a rather common physical process of cluster formation .",
    "this merging process has been found to affect greatly star formation histories of member galaxies and to eventually induce secondary starburst ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the coincidence of the position of the strongest k+a galaxies and the x - ray substructures in coma found by @xcite strengthens this scenario .        to check whether the presence of sub - structures alters the star formation in cluster galaxies , we compute the fractions of the psb galaxies belonging to these systems .",
    "we use the catalogs of the wings substructures presented by biviano et al .",
    "( in prep . ) , who define substructures and assign member galaxies to potential substructures exploiting the velocity distributions of galaxies in the cluster local density peaks .",
    "30.4@xmath330.4% of the member galaxies belong to substructures and , among these , 6.1@xmath330.4% are psb galaxies and 0.9@xmath330.2% are spsbs .",
    "the percentage of the psbs is slightly lower than the value found for the same population when considering the entire galaxy sample ( 7.2@xmath330.2% ) .",
    "the same conclusion holds for the fraction of psb and spsb galaxies with respect to the active population .",
    "thus , this type of analysis does not reveal a strong psb enhancement in substructures .",
    "we also investigate the fraction of psb , pas and eml galaxies in clusters characterized by different levels of relaxation .",
    "we use the parameter sub defined in biviano et al .",
    "( in prep . ) that depends , among other things , on the fraction of member galaxies belonging to substructures , and consider three types of clusters : relaxed ( @xmath81 ) , partly relaxed ( @xmath82 ) and unrelaxed ( @xmath83 ) . in agreement with e.g.",
    "@xcite and @xcite , we find a higher / lower fraction of eml / pas galaxies in less relaxed clusters than in more - relaxed ones ( 0.344@xmath330.005/0.580@xmath330.005 ; 0.408@xmath330.0084/0.522@xmath330.009 and 0.44@xmath330.01/0.50@xmath330.01 for sub=0 , sub=1 and sub@xmath84 , respectively ) .",
    "even more interestingly , the fraction of psb galaxies also depends on the dynamical state of the cluster , following the trend of the pas population : the psb / psb+eml fractions are 0.179@xmath330.006 , 0.144@xmath85 and 0.12@xmath330.01 for sub=0 , 1 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "this is the opposite of what might be expected , if merging clusters were the most favorable environment for psb production .",
    "part of this trend might be due to the existence of the correlation between psb fraction and @xmath86 ( fig .  7 ) , as the average x - ray luminosity decreases going from more relaxed to less relaxed clusters ( 2.8 , 2.7 and 1.3 @xmath87 for sub=0 , 1 , @xmath84 ) .",
    "moreover , the most unrelaxed clusters are in a sense clusters still in the formation process , in which the galaxy populations are still very similar to the unprocessed population of galaxies in the merging groups / clusters , therefore are still very rich of star - forming galaxies that have not experienced a massive cluster environment yet .",
    "many recent papers @xcite have shown that galaxy populations with different dynamical histories are well separated in the so - called phase space , which links the spatial position of a galaxy in the clusters , in units of r@xmath20 , and its peculiar velocity , @xmath88 , normalized by the velocity dispersion of the cluster @xmath28 . moreover ,",
    "the theoretical phase - space diagram derived from cosmological simulations retains information of the epoch of accretion of a galaxy , that can therefore be estimated based on the location of the galaxy in the diagram @xcite .",
    "the same is unfortunately not possible with observations , given the large uncertainties that induce the different populations to overlap on the plane .",
    "however , it is still possible to retrieve important clues about the dynamical histories of the different galaxy populations in clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , the overall distribution of galaxies in the phase space strongly depends on the infall times : galaxies that where accreted earlier ( i.e. virialized galaxies ) typically occupy a triangular - shaped region while the recently accreted or infalling population permeates all projected velocities and radii . combining this evidence with the well - established correlation between galaxy quiescence and environment ,",
    "pas galaxies are expected to form the majority of the virialized population while eml and psb galaxies should belong to the infall or recently accreted sample .",
    "figure [ pps ] shows the projected phase space obtained combining all clusters together for the different subpopulations separately .",
    "as expected , pas galaxies are typically found in a triangular - shaped virialized region , which corresponds to the low velocity - low distance area , while eml galaxies are more spread in both radius and velocity . the psb population ,",
    "as already discussed , preferentially lie at small clustercentric distances ( r<0.6@xmath19 ) , exhibiting anyway a non negligible spread in velocity .",
    "a 2d k - s test rejects the hypothesis that both psb and eml and , with a slightly less significance , psb and pas galaxies are drawn from the same distribution ( p - values respectively of 0.0 and 0.07 ) , suggesting indeed that these populations are in different stages of their virialization process .",
    "the spsb population can be better distinguished in terms of velocity rather than clustercentric distance : following the general radial trend of psb galaxies , these galaxies have slightly higher velocities(median @xmath89 of 0.67@xmath330.02 and 0.87@xmath330.07 for the psb and spsb population , respectively ) .    ) of each galaxy population ; colors refer to the different populations as described in the labels and as in fig .",
    "[ fig : frac_type ] .",
    "errors are jackknife standard deviations @xcite .",
    "[ fig : veldisp ] ]    to better quantify the differences between the populations , modeling the results presented by @xcite for 75 simulated clusters at z@xmath90 , fig .",
    "[ fig : veldisp ] shows the mean normalized line of sight ( los ) velocity dispersion of each sub - population ( @xmath91 ) in six bins of projected radial distance .",
    "the errors are obtained using the classical jackknife technique @xcite . due to the low number statistics",
    ", the spsb sample is divided only in three bins spanning the same radial range .    by comparison with the analysis of @xcite ,",
    "the different velocity dispersion profiles can be explained according to the dynamical evolution and accretion history of the galaxy populations .",
    "pas and eml galaxies are well separated , the former having low los - velocity dispersion at all radii with respect to the latter that displays , especially in the cluster core , higher values of @xmath28 .",
    "these trends are best reproduced by the virialized population , which was accreted at early epochs ( @xmath92 ) , and by the most recently accreted and backsplash populations , respectively @xcite the profile of the psb population follows the one traced by the pas@xmath93virialized population , while spsbs have remarkably larger velocity dispersions thus belonging to the more recently accreted population .",
    "these findings well fit the scenario in which the strength of the ew(h@xmath71 ) sets a time line with higher values indicating a more recent quenching event . if the spsbs are the consequence of a star - burst prior to a sudden quenching , the violent@xmath93sudden event that triggers the burst seems to happen on first infall ; moderate psbs could originate in the same way but are observed longer time after quenching @xcite .",
    "this result moves in the same direction of @xcite who , investigating the location of different classes of galaxies on the stacked phase space of clusters at z@xmath51 , found that post - starburst galaxies are commonly found at small clustercentric radii with high clustercentric velocities .",
    "so far we have shown how the fractions of the different subpopulations change as a function of the spatial location , both physical and dynamical , within the clusters .",
    "we now examine if and how the fraction of psb galaxies depends on the global properties of the clusters , such as velocity dispersion and x - ray luminosity , both proxy for the system total mass .",
    "it is still unclear whether or not the cluster mass affects the amount of observed star formation .",
    "for example , several studies at high and intermediate redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) find an inverse correlation between star formation and cluster mass , while others ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) assert that no such correlation exists in the nearby cluster population .",
    "all our clusters contain galaxies belonging to all the three main spectral classes , but the population mix in each cluster is quite different . to assess",
    "if these differences arise from a dependence on the cluster halo mass , for each cluster we compute the psb fraction , weighted for completeness , among all galaxies and among the active population . for this analysis",
    ", we restricted the data to an absolute magnitude limited sample .",
    "this should prevent the introduction of possible systematics related to the selection criteria of the cluster sample .",
    "member galaxies brighter than @xmath94 were selected .",
    "this is the absolute magnitude corresponding to the @xmath22 apparent magnitude limit of the most distant cluster .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fraz_global ] where the individual systems , indicated as black points , are shown as a function of velocity dispersion ( left ) and x - ray luminosity ( right ) .    to mark the average trends we group the cluster sample into five bins of @xmath28 and @xmath86 with approximately the same number of galaxies and",
    "show the results as red points .",
    "both fractions ( psb / all and psb / active galaxies ) increase with the mass of the system , more significantly when we consider the x - ray luminosity rather than the velocity dispersion . a spearman test , which assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function , performed on the unbinned data , yields a 99.8%(99.9% ) and 98.1%(99.3% ) probability of a correlation of the psb / all ( psb / active ) fraction with l@xmath95 and @xmath28 respectively .",
    "this result is in line with the findings of @xcite for clusters in the ediscs sample at @xmath96 even if the strength of the correlations for our sample is lower , ( the spearman test yields a 99.1% and 99.7% probability of a correlation with the velocity dispersion of their psb / all and psb / active fractions , respectively ) .",
    "in contrast , it is at odds with the analysis performed by @xcite on the restricted wings sample .",
    "these authors did not detect correlations with either the velocity dispersion or the x - ray luminosity .",
    "discrepancies could be due to several reasons , such as the different selection criteria for post - starburst galaxies ( they did not use the information on the h@xmath97 line ) , the different cut in magnitude , the higher completeness or the larger area covered by our sample .",
    "exploiting the capabilities of the combined wings and omegawings samples , in this paper we have investigated the properties and the spatial distribution of galaxies that are currently star - forming , that have recently interrupted their star formation and that are already passive in clusters at @xmath2 .",
    "our main focus has been on psb galaxies , to shed light on the processes that induce galaxies to undergo this particular phase during their life .",
    "psb galaxies are characterized by intermediate physical properties with respect to the eml and pas galaxies , and are thought to be in a transition phase between these two populations : both their median stellar mass and magnitudes are in between the values found for the other two populations . as expected given the fact that they have no ongoing star formation , psb galaxies present colors similar to the pas galaxies , even though at faint magnitudes they can also be as blue as the eml galaxies .",
    "almost half of the psbs galaxies have been classified as s0s , while the incidence of elliptical and late - type galaxies depends on the strength of the measured ew of h@xmath1 : considering all psbs , the fraction of ellipitcals and late - types is similar , considering only the spsb , late - type galaxies dominate the population",
    ".    the fraction of psb galaxies decreases with increasing distance , suggesting that in the core of the clusters some mechanisms are inducing galaxy transitions .",
    "the same fraction also depends on the cluster properties and it steadily increases with increasing @xmath98 and @xmath28 . moreover ,",
    "psbs do not concentrate as much in the low clustercentric distance - low velocity locus of the phase - space as virialized galaxies do .",
    "this , together with the fact that their velocity dispersion is quite intermediate between that of pas and eml galaxies , especially for the spsb galaxies , could lead to the interpretation that psbs are a combination of galaxies with a mix of times - since infall ( backsplash + virialized ) .",
    "ideally , one should define the virial , infall and backsplash classes following the orbits of the particles using cosmological simulation .",
    "this task is beyond the scope of this work but will be addressed in forthcoming papers .",
    "as found by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , psb galaxies have to be generated by a fast acting mechanism , given that this phase can last approximately 1 - 1.5 gyr .",
    "as already discusses in sec.[intro ] , spectra showing strong balmer absorption lines and no emission are the result of a precise combination of an old stellar population above which a - type stars signatures are well visible .",
    "these stars , formed within the last gyr , dominate the light of a galaxy where a recent star formation activity has ended abruptly and are visible for 1 - 1.5 gyr ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . even though this is a quite efficient channel to transform galaxies from star forming to passive , it is definitely not the only one .",
    "e.g. @xcite have found a population of galaxies in transition on long time scales ( few gyr ) both in the local universe and at higher redshift ( @xmath99 ) . adopting a different approach , following the infall and orbits of galaxies in the vicinity of the 75 most massive clusters in the millennium cosmological simulation , also @xcite support a slow quenching scenario , with a timescale of the order of 0.7 - 2 gyr .",
    "seeking for objects in transition from being star forming to becoming passive , @xcite analyzed the sfr - m@xmath100 relation of local cluster galaxies in a mass - limited sample extracted from the wings+omegawings sample .",
    "they identified a population of galaxies , called _ transition galaxies _ , located 1.5@xmath28 below the field sfr - m@xmath100 relation , whose star formation histories and properties suggest that they have had a reduced sfr for the past 2 - 5 gyr . at least above the mass completeness limit ,",
    "the fraction of transition galaxies strongly depends on environment , being almost negligible outside the virial radius and rising towards the center , making up for almost the 30% of star forming galaxies inside 0.6r@xmath20 . as concluded by the authors , these findings , together with the estimated quenching time scale , are consistent with the hypothesis that the interaction of galaxies with the intracluster medium via strangulation causes a gradual shut down of star formation .",
    "we are now in the position of directly comparing the slow quenching channel characterized by @xcite with the much faster one required to observe the typical post - starburst signatures .",
    "to do so , we consider only galaxies with stellar mass larger than the mass completeness limit of 10@xmath101 used by @xcite .",
    "346 psb galaxies ( 650 once weighted for completeness ) enter the sample , of which only 32 ( 56 ) are spsb . above this limit ,",
    "psbs constitute the 7.3@xmath330.3% of the total population and all the environmental dependencies found for the whole sample persist . for comparison , above the same limit and the same clustercentric distance , 408 ( 780 ) galaxies have been classified by @xcite as in transition , and they constitute 9.0@xmath330.3% of the entire population . by definition , being transition galaxies selected from the star forming population , there is no object entering both samples .",
    "therefore transition galaxies are only slightly more numerous than psb galaxies . starting from the logical assumption that both populations have a common progenitor among star - forming galaxies , and",
    "if we assume that the transition phase lasts for about twice the time ( of the order of @xmath572 gyr ) of the psb visibility ( @xmath51 gyr ) , we conclude that the short timescale star - formation `` quenching '' channel contributes at least two times more than the long timescale one to the growth of the passive population .",
    "figure [ fig : ka_tr ] investigates in detail where these two populations are found within the clusters .",
    "it shows the number of transition and psb galaxies to the total number of galaxies , as a function of clustercentric distance . as done by @xcite ,",
    "two different mass bins are considered here , to also look for trends with stellar mass . for @xmath102 , psb and",
    "transition galaxies present a similar anticorrelation between the fraction of psb and transition objects and distance , even though psb galaxies show a slightly flatter trend , being less numerous than transition galaxies in the core of the clusters and slightly more numerous outside the virial radius .    for @xmath103 , at large clustercentric distances , both populations present trends similar to those at lower masses , but in the cluster cores they present a drop in number .",
    "such drop occurs only in the cluster cores for transition galaxies , at @xmath104 for psbs .",
    "overall , it might be primarily due to the fact that in the cluster cores massive galaxies are already mostly passive , therefore the reservoir for transitioning galaxies is poorer than at lower masses . in addition , the different behavior seen for the two populations could be due to the visibility time - scales of the two populations , with psbs disappearing faster than transition galaxies on the way to the cluster core .    as mentioned in  [ sec : dataset ] , galaxies drawn from the wings sample ( approximately all those located within 0.6 @xmath19 ) , have been morphologically classified .",
    "we can therefore compare the morphologies of psb and transition galaxies in the core of the clusters , to look for signs of a link between galaxy morphology and time scale of quenching .",
    "we consider the mass limited samples .",
    "overall , among psb galaxies , 40@xmath332% are ellipticals , 44@xmath332% are s0s and the remaining 16@xmath332% are late - type galaxies .",
    "transition galaxies have a much more numerous population of s0s , with a remarkable 56@xmath332% at the expense of elliptical galaxies , accounting only for the 28@xmath332% , while 16@xmath332% are late - types .",
    "no strong trends of the morphological mix with distance have been detected .",
    "however , we stress that here we are considering only galaxies in the core of the clusters , and we are not attempting to extrapolate trends at larger distances , where the morphological mix might be different . in addition",
    ", we remind the reader that this analysis is performed above the mass completeness limit of 10@xmath101 and that this cut excludes the vast majority of spsb galaxies from our sample .",
    "this population have been found to have a distinct morphology from the whole population of psb galaxies ( see  [ sec : properties ] ) .",
    "studies regarding slow and fast quenching should necessarily follow different approaches . as far as the post - starburst population is concerned , due to the high precision clock imposed by a - type stars lifetime , there is a general agreement on the time - scales involved ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) and , from these , different mechanisms have been proposed . on the other hand ,",
    "an hypothesis on the physical processes causing the slow quenching of a galaxy has to be made to estimate the time scales involved .",
    "several authors have tried to estimate the quenching timescales of satellite galaxies through different approaches .",
    "@xcite proposed a mass dependent `` delay - then - rapid '' scenario in which star formation is quenched rapidly but only after a delay of 2 - 4 gyr after infall .",
    "as an alternative @xcite presented models where quenching occurs within a smaller radius , approximately @xmath105 , followed by an exponential decline of star formation over 3 - 3.5 gyr .",
    "we found the majority of transition and psb galaxies within the virial radius .",
    "it seems clear from our results that any of the proposed physical mechanisms ( i.e. starvation or ram pressure stripping ) , which alter the star formation of infalling galaxies , is stronger in the central regions of the cluster , where the density and the temperature of the icm ( as well as the velocity of galaxies ) reach their maxima . by comparing the cluster crossing times and the a - stars lifetime",
    ", we could also imagine an evolutionary sequence in which some of the psbs ( the low mass ones , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : properties ] ) descend from spsb galaxies , i.e. the ram pressure starts being effective at larger distances , generating the population of spsb , while at smaller cluster - centric distances we only see the psb galaxies .",
    "however , the comparison of the radial trend of the fractions of psbs and transition galaxies does not allow to definitely ascertain whether the two populations have a different origin .",
    "indeed , considering for example that ram pressure stripping depends , among other things , on the orbit and on the orientation of the galaxy with respect to the icm @xcite , we can depict two different scenarios in which star formation can either be suddenly shut down ( on timescales of the order of @xmath51gyr , @xcite ) or gently and progressively depressed by ram - pressure stripping , and therefore give origin to the two observed galaxy populations .    in the first scenario ,",
    "the resulting quenched population is expected to have psb features , maintaining the original structural properties , since nothing apart from gas loss would disturb its morphology .",
    "recall that the quenching time scale of psb galaxies is imposed by a - type stars lifetime . in the second scenario",
    ", ram - pressure stripping might be the main responsible also for the transition population presented in @xcite . nonetheless , the same population could originate also via strangulation , consistent with a gradual quenching corresponding to an exponential time scale of a 2 gyr or more .",
    "indeed , strangulation is expected to have the effect of removing the outer galaxy gas halo and prevent further infall of gas into the disk . on timescales of few gyr , the star formation would thus exhaust the available gas , quenching the star formation activity .",
    "in addition to ram - pressure stripping and strangulation , other mechanisms might play a role , even though they most likely take place at larger distances form the cluster center .    as discussed for example by @xcite and reviewed by @xcite , quenching from gravitational interaction between galaxies ( i.e. galaxy - galaxy interactions , harassment ) occurs preferentially outside the virial radius , given the high velocity dispersions in the cluster cores that remarkably reduce the probability of pair interactions , with timescales of the order of some @xmath106 yr . moreover , these interactions act on the stellar component , producing selective morphological transformations that we do not observe in the transition or psb populations .",
    "we emphasize that this does not mean that galaxy - galaxy interactions have no effect at all on cluster galaxies .",
    "these processes might eventually become important , but generally after the gas has been removed by other processes .",
    "[ conclusion ] in this work we have resorted to an observed magnitude limited sample of galaxies in clusters drawn from the wide - field nearby galaxy - cluster survey ( wings ) @xcite , and omegawings surveys @xcite to investigate the occurrence and the properties of galaxies of different types in 32 clusters at @xmath2 .",
    "we classified the galaxies according to the different features detected in their spectra ( presence / absence of oii , oiii , h@xmath1 and h@xmath6 ) into passive ( pas ) , post starburst ( psb ) and emission line ( eml ) galaxies .",
    "we have compared stellar population properties and location within the clusters of the different spectral types to obtain valuable insights on the physical processes responsible for the star formation quenching .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows .",
    "* for @xmath3 , pas represent @xmath107% of the cluster population within 1.2 virial radii , eml represent @xmath108% and psbs @xmath109 , 15% of which show strong h@xmath1 in absorption ( > 6 , spsb ) , indication of either a very recent quenching and/or of a strong burst before quenching .",
    "* psbs have stellar masses , magnitudes , colors and morphologies intermediate between pas and eml galaxies , typical of a population in transition from being star forming to passive .",
    "interestingly , 45% of psbs have s0 morphology , @xmath110% are ellipticals and @xmath111% are late types . considering only spsbs , the incidence of late - types increases to @xmath112% with a corresponding drops of ellipitcals , which are only @xmath113% . *",
    "the incidence of psbs slightly increases from the cluster outskirts toward the cluster center and from the least toward the most luminous and massive clusters , defined in terms of @xmath86 and velocity dispersion . *",
    "the dynamical state of the clusters partially influences the incidence of psbs .",
    "while the presence of substructures does not enhance the fraction of psbs , the level of relaxation does : the fraction of psbs is higher in relaxed clusters .",
    "at least part of this trend is due to the correlation between psb fraction and @xmath86 .",
    "* the phase space analysis and the velocity dispersion profiles suggest that psbs represent a combination of galaxies with different accretion histories .",
    "moreover , the psbs with the strongest h@xmath1 are consistent with being recently accreted .",
    "psbs are thought to be galaxies generated by fast acting mechanisms and this phase is expected to last approximately 1 - 1.5 gyr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our analysis suggests that as a galaxy is accreted onto a cluster , at first its properties are not strongly affected , but when it approaches the virialized region of the cluster , processes like ram pressure stripping or other interactions induce either a burst of the star formation with a subsequent fast quenching , or simply a fast quenching .",
    "as the shut off of the star formation occurs , the galaxy changes the features in its spectrum , but variations in color and morphology require longer time scales , therefore psbs appear with a wide range of these properties .",
    "it is important to stress that the majority of those galaxies that are truncated on a short timescale can not be recognized based on color or color+morphology , but only by performing a detailed spectral analysis .",
    "the fraction of psbs is similar to the fraction of galaxies in transition on longer timescales , as defined by @xcite , suggesting that the short timescale star - formation quenching channel , lasting less than half the timescale required to slowly quench star formation , contributes two times more than the long timescale one to the growth of the passive population , therefore processes like ram pressure stripping and interactions are more efficient than strangulation in affecting star formation , at least in clusters .    in other environments , the fraction of psb galaxies and the processes responsible for its existence might be considerably different .",
    "@xcite have found hints of an enhanced fraction of psb galaxies in groups compared to isolated and binary systems , but a complete characterization of the physical processes is still missing . in a forthcoming paper ( paccagnella et al . in prep . ) , we will characterize the incidence of post starburst galaxies in the different environments , contrasting the properties of galaxies in clusters , groups , binary systems and isolated galaxies , to build a complete picture of the assembly of this population .",
