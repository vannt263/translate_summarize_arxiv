    "noise is an important obstacle for the scale - up of quantum information devices  both decoherence due to interactions with an external environment , and the internal control errors inevitable for any information - processing .",
    "the theory of quantum error correction was developed by analogy to classical error - correcting codes to overcome this obstacle @xcite .",
    "quantum error - correcting codes ( qeccs ) store quantum information redundantly in an entangled state of multiple quantum systems ( usually qubits ) , in such a way that errors can be detected and corrected without directly measuring ( and hence disturbing ) the quantum information to be protected . the fact that this can be done at all is quite remarkable , and has opened up the prospect that quantum information processing may become a viable technology in the foreseeable future .    broadly speaking ,",
    "quantum error correction is useful in two main contexts .",
    "the first is quantum computation , where errors that occur during a calculation must be constantly found and corrected to keep them from accumulating .",
    "the qeccs used for this purpose must fit into an overall fault - tolerant scheme @xcite , which puts important constraints on the properties of the codes used .",
    "the other main context is quantum communication .",
    "here it is assumed that the steps of encoding and decoding are largely error - free , and all errors occurs during the transmission of quantum information through a noisy quantum channel .",
    "this is the context we will consider in this paper .",
    "it should be noted , though , that this division is not really sharp : quantum computers may well need to transmit information internally , and quantum communication may be part of a distributed information processing scheme .    in the context of quantum communications , one can explore the effect of different shared resources on the ability to detect and correct errors .",
    "recently , a great deal of work has been done on entanglement - assisted quantum error correction ( eaqec ) , and entanglement - assisted quantum error - correcting codes ( eaqeccs ) . in these schemes ,",
    "the sender ( usually called alice ) and receiver ( usually called bob ) share some number of pure maximally - entangled states , or ebits .",
    "alice can use her halves of these ebits in the encoding procedure , and bob can use his halves in error correction and decoding .",
    "the idea of using entanglement to improve error correction was proposed early in the history of quantum information theory @xcite , but it took a long time for the first steps towards designing practical codes @xcite .",
    "this work has led to a generalized theory of quantum error correcting codes , the entanglement - assisted stabilizer formalism @xcite .",
    "the large majority of work on qeccs has concerned stabilizer codes @xcite , which can be derived from classical linear codes . in this algebraic approach ,",
    "one generally tries to design codes that are able to detect and correct an abstract set of errors acting on single qubits , often based on the pauli operators .",
    "qeccs have the property that any linear combination of correctable errors is also a correctable error .",
    "since the pauli operators form a basis for all single - qubit operators , the ability to correct pauli - based errors implies the ability to correct more realistic models of noise , provided that errors are not too highly correlated between qubits .",
    "the eaqeccs that have mostly been derived so far extend this stabilizer formalism to include a broader class of codes that utilize shared entanglement .",
    "the standard approach to qec finds encoding and recovery procedures which ensure perfect recovery of quantum states passing through sufficiently weak noisy channels .",
    "the disadvantage of this approach is that it may fail when the noise strength , or error probability , is too high .",
    "another approach to qec is to tailor qeccs to a particular model of realistic noise , derived from a detailed model or from experimental measurements @xcite , e.g. , via quantum process tomography @xcite .",
    "the tailored approach to qec attempts to find encoding and recovery operations which are _ optimized _ relative to the particular experimentally measured noise or assumed noise model , in the sense that they maximize the fidelity ( or minimize the distance ) of the encoded output state relative to the input state @xcite .",
    "both worst case and average case performance has been considered in this setting , which usually involves numerical optimization .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it tends to be more robust to variations in the noise strength than the standard approach @xcite .",
    "here we further develop the optimized qec approach by considering , for the first time , entanglement - assisted quantum error correction as an optimization problem .    to formulate the problem for optimization",
    ", we break down quantum error correction into three stages .",
    "first , the quantum state to be protected is encoded .",
    "this procedure appends some number of ancilla qubits in a fixed initial state , and then applies an encoding unitary to the information and ancilla qubits together .",
    "these qubits then pass through a noisy channel ( assumed to be known ) . at the receiver s side , more",
    "ancillas can be appended , and then a decoding unitary is applied .",
    "all the ancillas ( encoding or recovery ) are discarded , and the state of the information qubits is the output .    in standard quantum error correction , the encoding and recovery ancillas always start in a standard state ( usually @xmath0 ) , and are not entangled with each other .",
    "previous work has shown that regular recovery ancillas are redundant in increasing the error correction fidelity @xcite .",
    "that is , given the same number of information qubits and encoding ancillas , the presence or absence of recovery ancillas makes no difference to the channel fidelity .",
    "this matches the properties of stabilizer codes , where decoding can be done unitarily , and there is no benefit in including recovery ancillas .    to formulate the problem for entanglement - assisted codes , we change the initial state of the ancillas , so that noiseless entanglement is shared between the encoding and recovery ancilla qubits .",
    "we show that this additional information can enhance the performance of the recovery ancillas , and increase the error correction fidelity in most cases .",
    "this initial shared entanglement can in principle improve performance in at least two different ways .",
    "it can allow the code to transfer quantum information about the initial state to the recovery block , improving the channel fidelity .",
    "this fidelity increase can in fact lead to perfect error correction for an important class of error channels .",
    "the error correction procedure for this class of channels can be interpreted as teleportation , with only classical information passing through the noisy channel .",
    "however , even in cases where the error correction protocol is not a form of teleportation , we can still get an improvement in performance .",
    "one interpretation of this is that entangled ancillas allow the recovery procedure to extract more information about the errors .",
    "this is analogous to superdense coding , where the use of entanglement boosts the rate of classical communication .",
    "the fidelity increase here shows the importance of relevant information stored in the ancillas in quantum error correction .",
    "the entangled recovery ancillas are fundamentally different than the regular recovery ancillas considered in previous optimization problems , that gave no benefit @xcite .",
    "the optimization procedure here , similar to previous work in this area @xcite , assumes that we know the noise channel .",
    "we assume that a channel identification procedure , such as quantum process tomography @xcite , has been performed prior to the error correction .",
    "it is also possible to optimize performance in cases where the exact channel model is not known , though we do not consider that here .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ problem ]",
    "we formulate the optimization problem in terms of a distance between states that needs to be minimized .",
    "the problem is bi - convex in the encoding and recovery operations , and in sections  [ sec : encoding ] and [ recovery ] we consider how to optimize the encoding for a given recovery , and recovery for a given encoding , respectively . in section  [ ruc ]",
    "we consider the case of random unitary channels , and analyze a simple example for which eaqec has perfect fidelity , via teleportation .",
    "we present numerical examples in section  [ examples ] , where we contrast different correction and optimization scenarios .",
    "these examples illustrate the improved performance of optimized eaqeccs in a setting where perfect fidelity can not be achieved .",
    "we conclude in section  [ conc ] .",
    "certain technical details are presented in appendix  [ d5-proof ] .",
    "a quantum dynamical process is a map from an initial state @xmath1 to a final state @xmath2 . in general the map",
    "@xmath3 does not represent unitary evolution .",
    "however , if we assume a larger closed quantum system that includes the environment ( or bath ) @xmath4 of the system , the total evolution becomes unitary .",

    "( [ channelu ] ) is a hermitian map ( i.e. , it maps hermitian operators to hermitian operators ) @xcite .",
    "when the initial system - bath state is purely classicaly correlated ( formally , has vanishing quantum discord @xcite ) , @xmath3 becomes a completely positive ( cp ) , trace - preserving map @xcite .",
    "this condition is also necessary @xcite . in this case",
    "the evolution can be represented using the kraus operator sum representation ( osr ) @xcite : @xmath13where the operators @xmath14 , known as kraus operators , satisfy the normalization condition @xmath15 ( identity ) .",
    "such maps are powerful tools which can represent different types of noise processes that could be acting on the system .    .",
    "the encoding and recovery ancillas are entangled before the encoding procedure @xmath16 begins , and are represented by @xmath17",
    ". the joint initial system state is @xmath18 .",
    "the recovery ancillas pass through a noiseless channel to the recovery operation @xmath19 .",
    "the information qubits and encoding ancillas pass through a noisy channel @xmath3 .",
    "the output of the recovery procedure is @xmath20 .",
    "the intermediate states @xmath21 ( output of the encoding ) and @xmath22 ( output of the noise channel ) are also indicated.,width=321 ]    we shall assume that the error correction procedures of encoding and recovery , as well as the noisy channel , can all be described using kraus operators .",
    "the entire procedure on the system can then be represented as @xmath23where @xmath16 , @xmath3 , and @xmath19 are the encoding , error and recovery operations respectively .",
    "the density matrices @xmath24 through @xmath25 are the states of the data qubits and the ancillas , i.e. , represent the state of the entire system at different points in time .",
    "the initial system state @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the total system hilbert space , is taken to be a product state between the data qubits , represented by @xmath28 , and the ancillas , represented by @xmath29 , i.e. ,  @xmath30 .",
    "thus @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are , respectively , the hilbert space of the data qubits and of the ancillas .",
    "the ancilla hilbert space further decomposes into an encoding subspace @xmath34 and a recovery subspace @xmath35 : @xmath36 .",
    "we write @xmath37 and otherwise denote the respective dimensions of the various subspaces by : @xmath38note that@xmath39    for most of our discussion we shall assume that all encoding ancillas are pairwise maximally entangled with recovery ancillas prior to the encoding operation , whence @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a maximally entangled state between encoding and recovery ancilla pairs . nevertheless , for generality we shall leave @xmath43 and @xmath44 unless it is necessary to be more specific . later",
    ", in our numerical examples , we shall also consider regular ( unentangled ) encoding and recovery ancillas .",
    "using the osr for each of these operations , the overall evolution is @xmath45where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are the kraus operators of the encoding , error , and recovery channels , respectively , all satisfying the normalization condition : @xmath49all the kraus operators are here represented by square @xmath50 matrices , i.e. , are operators on @xmath51 .",
    "the number of kraus operators for each map depends on the implementation and the basis representation , but the number @xmath52 of error operators is bounded above by @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "we shall assume that the encoding operation @xmath16 is unitary , represented by a single unitary ( kraus ) operator @xmath54 .",
    "the encoded @xmath55-dimensional state is therefore@xmath56since , as illustrated in figure [ ea ] , the encoding does not act on the second half of the entangled pairs ( the recovery ancillas ) , the encoding unitary @xmath54 should be represented as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a @xmath59 matrix , and where @xmath60 .",
    "we shall write @xmath61 to denote the identity operator acting on a subspace @xmath62 , and reserve @xmath63 for the identity operator on the entire system space @xmath51 .",
    "our goal is to implement a close approximation to a certain desired unitary @xmath64 on the entire system space .",
    "more specifically , the purpose of optimization is to design the encoding @xmath16 and recovery @xmath19 for a given error channel @xmath3 such that the overall map ( map ) @xmath65 is as close as possible to some desired unitary @xmath66 .",
    "this goal is different from that pursued in earlier optimization papers ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where the goal was to obtain a good approximation to a unitary @xmath67 acting only on the data qubits .",
    "our present goal is general enough to encapsulate state preservation of the data qubits , e.g. , by implementing , with as high a fidelity as possible , a unitary which swaps the data qubits into the recovery qubits at the end of the process , while leaving the data and encoding qubits in a new pure state which is tensored with the recovery qubits .",
    "indeed , this is essentially what happens in our teleportation example ( section [ ruc ] ) .",
    "channel fidelity or distance are typical measures of performance between two quantum channels @xcite .",

    "there are three matrices of parameters @xmath93 in this expression that are to be optimized .",
    "as stated , this optimization is not convex .",
    "therefore , as first suggested by reimpell and werner @xcite , to identify the optimal values of these parameters , we solve this optimization problem iteratively . starting with an arbitrary initial encoding operation , we first find the optimized recovery operation , which by itself is a convex problem ; we then fix the recovery operation obtained in the previous step , and find the optimized encoding operation , which is also a convex problem ; and so on , alternately optimizing the recovery and encoding operations until the procedure converges .",
    "@xmath94 is an intermediary matrix of parameters that must also be recalculated at each step .",
    "this iteration continues until the distance ( [ dis ] ) stops decreasing .",
    "the details of the procedure at each step are provided in the next two sections .",
    "the design of the optimized recovery operation at each step is not affected by the extra constraints added by introducing entanglement in the error correction procedure .",
    "this is so because optimization of the recovery operation does not depend on the details of the encoding operation .",
    "however , the extra constraints play an important role in identifying the optimized encoding operation , which must be of the desired form @xmath95 .",
    "the encoding ancillas must be initialized in a maximally entangled state  for example , an epr pair . however , the distance measure defined in ( [ dis ] ) is independent of the initial state of the ancilla qubits . to overcome this problem",
    "we add an extra step , an _ entangling _",

    "we note the following matrix differentiation identities , valid for any pair of matrices @xmath105 and @xmath106 with compatible dimensions , with @xmath105 being independent of the elements of @xmath106 : @xmath107 & = & a^{t},\\quad \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial z}\\mathrm{tr}[az^{\\dag } ] = 0 .",

    "there are two operations in ( [ channelu ] ) that are not random unitary .",

    "as shown in figure [ telep ] , he can recover the original state @xmath163 by measuring the state of the first two qubits .",
    "based on the result of the measurement he applies the appropriate pauli operator to the last qubit , his half of the ebit , to recover the original state .",
    "for example , if he measures the first two qubits to be @xmath164 , he should apply @xmath165 to the last qubit to recover the original state .",
    "as an example of a random unitary channel with two unitary operators , we consider the bit flip error channel , or binary symmetric channel , in which bit flip errors occur independently with probability @xmath166 on each qubit .",
    "this channel can be represented as @xmath167where henceforth @xmath168 denote the standard @xmath169 pauli matrices . as shown in figure [ bf ] , this error can be corrected using an ebit as the error - correcting resource .",

    "the encoding acts on the initial data qubit and the first entangled qubit ( the encoding qubit ) .",
    "considering that the error is already in the form ( [ oneu ] ) , we do not need to apply the initial unitary operator here .",

    "convex optimization has rediscovered the protocol of quantum teleportation .",

    "this error channel clearly can not be represented in the form of ( [ twou ] ) .",
    "hence our teleportation argument does not apply here .",
    "there is no choice of basis for which classical information can be sent through this channel error - free .",
    "while entanglement can not enable perfect error correction in this case , it can still increase the useful information about the errors available to the recovery block , and therefore increase the fidelity of the error correction .",
    "figure [ adp ] presents the fidelity of error correction for this channel for different values of @xmath166 .",
    "the only difference between the upper and middle curve is the presence of entanglement . without entanglement , the extra qubit used in the recovery acts as a regular recovery ancilla , and therefore does not increase the fidelity .",
    "the minimum fidelity in both cases occurs at @xmath174 , where the channel is symmetric in @xmath63 , @xmath165 and @xmath175 : @xmath176 .     and",
    "[ adp ] , there is a single data qubit going through the noise channel unprotected ( blue , bottom curve ) , optimally protected by a single encoding and a single recovery qubit in a product state ( blue , middle curve , overlapping red for @xmath177 ) , and optimally protected by an ebit ( red , top curve).,width=340 ]      in this example we consider a particularly simple error model that is widely used to describe noisy quantum systems : the depolarizing channel .",
    "this important channel is often considered to be the quantum equivalent of the binary symmetric channel in classical error correction .",
    "it occurs when the state of the system can be completely mixed by the action of the channel .",
    "the noise is unbiased in the sense that it generates bit flip errors , phase flip errors , or both with equal probability ; this is represented by the map @xmath178the depolarizing channel shrinks the radius of the bloch sphere by a factor of @xmath179 while preserving its shape @xcite .",
    "interestingly , for this error channel the ebit does _ not _ increase the fidelity for @xmath180 .",
    "the optimized fidelity of the channel with and without using an ebit is presented in figure  [ dp ] .",
    "a break point occurs at @xmath181 , when the coefficients in ( [ depolar ] ) become equal .",
    "the fidelities of both cases are the same for @xmath180 , but the ebit can slightly increase the fidelity for @xmath182 .",
    "an observation that may explain this difference is that for @xmath180 we can write @xmath183 , where @xmath184 is the _ twirling _ operation : @xmath185for any valid density matrix @xmath1 . in other words",
    ", with probability @xmath186 the channel replaces the qubit with a maximally mixed qubit . for @xmath182",
    "this interpretation is no longer possible , and it is in this regime that shared entanglement seems to give improvement .",
    "previous work on optimized quantum error correction @xcite . considered the `` standard '' , entanglement - unassisted setting . in this work we addressed , for the first time",
    ", the problem of optimized entanglement - assisted quantum error correction . our methodology is a generalization of the optimization approach developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which involves a bi - convex optimization problem , iterating between encoding and recovery .",
    "our main technical innovation appears in the encoding step , where we introduced a method to account for the constraint of initial entanglement between the encoding and recovery ancillas .",
    "our method returns the optimized channel fidelity for a given noise channel in the presence of shared entanglement between the encoding and recovery block .",
    "we showed that entanglement can substantially increase the error correction fidelity . for specific error channels",
    "this fidelity increase can lead to perfect error correction . in these cases ,",
    "the error correction procedure can be interpreted as quantum teleportation . for cases in which perfect error correction is not possible",
    ", this teleportation interpretation does not apply ; however , our optimization method returns the optimized fidelity for these channels , in most cases showing improvement with the resource of shared entanglement .    for one channel we found no improvement : the depolarizing channel . for the small codes that we considered in this paper , optimized standard quantum error correction performed just as well as optimized entanglement - assisted quantum error correction on this channel .",
    "it is possible that this equivalence between entanglement - assisted and standard quantum error correction will not hold for larger codewords on the depolarizing channel .",
    "larger codewords would use either more ancillas or more ebits in the encoding process .",
    "the possibility that larger codes might show a greater difference is suggested by the fact that a three - qubit codeword with two ebits exists that can correct an arbitrary single - qubit error @xcite , while the smallest standard code that corrects an arbitrary error is of size five @xcite .",
    "however , the performance of _ optimized _ quantum error correction for larger codewords remains a subject for future research .",
    "larger codewords make for a more numerically intensive optimization procedure .    considering that regular recovery ancillas are redundant in the optimized error correction procedure , the results of this paper show that information about errors in the encoded data , transferred to the recovery block through entanglement with the encoded state , can increase the fidelity for many channels .",
    "we expect that results for a wider variety of error channels and larger codewords will continue to bear this out .",
