    "the quasar j1819@xmath03845 exhibits 2035% rms intensity modulations on intra - hour timescales at centimetre wavelengths .",
    "the variations are due to interstellar scintillation caused by plasma thought to be located only @xmath9412pc from earth ( dennett - thorpe & de bruyn 2002 , 2003 , hereafter db03 ) .",
    "for @xmath910pc the @xmath10min scintillations observed in the period december to march each year imply an overall source size of @xmath11as , corresponding to 0.39pc at its redshift of 0.54 ( @xmath12kms@xmath13mpc@xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "the source has exhibited variations every time since they were first observed in 1999 .",
    "this is surprising because it might be supposed that such a compact source , with a brightness temperature exceeding the inverse compton limit , should expand and cease scintillation after several months .",
    "this problem is common to several persistent extreme intra - day variable sources including pks1519@xmath16273 and pks1257@xmath16326 ( macquart et al . 2000 , bignall et al .",
    "2003 ) . at the very least",
    ", one would expect such compact sources to exhibit some degree of structural variability , made evident by changes in the variability characteristics .",
    "the detection of structural changes in intra - hour variable sources is complicated , however , by annual cycles in their variability time scale ( db03 ; bignall et al .",
    "both the amplitude and direction of the scintillation velocity change as the earth s velocity changes relative to the scattering medium as it orbits the sun .",
    "this changes the scintillation direction , which in turn alters the character of the scintillations ( i.e. its power spectrum ) if the turbulence in the scattering medium is anisotropic or if the source structure is asymmetric .",
    "both asymmetries hinder searches for structural variability .",
    "these asymmetries are particularly important for j1819@xmath03845 because its scintillation pattern is anisotropic , with an axial ratio of @xmath17 ( db03 ) .    in this paper",
    "we identify the emergence of a new structure within j1819@xmath03845 at @xmath18 cm by comparing observations taken at identical epochs each year , thus removing ambiguity introduced by the annual cycle between intrinsic source structural evolution and asymmetry in the scintillation pattern . in ",
    "2 we present the lightcurves indicating the emergence of this new structure . in ",
    "3 the lightcurve power spectra are analysed to deduce its properties .",
    "the implications of the discovery are summarised in  4 .",
    "figure [ lightcurvesfig ] shows the lightcurves from observations made over six epochs in the period 2000 - 6 at 4.8ghz with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope .",
    "details of the data reduction procedure are described in db03 .",
    "each observation was made at the same time each year so that the scintillation velocity vector is identical on all occasions ; no lightcurves during the period 2001 - 2 are shown because we do not have good quality lightcurves near the pertinent dates .",
    "the lightcurves exhibit an increase in the degree of small timescale structure in 2004 - 5 compared to those spanning the interval 2000 - 3 .",
    "the power spectra of the variations develop substantial structure at angular frequencies between 0.005 and 0.02 rads@xmath13 , and peak - to - peak variations",
    "shorter than 15mins ( corresponding to structure on a timescale @xmath19mins in the structure function ) are observed in the 2004 - 5 lightcurves .",
    "this corresponds to the highly significant @xmath20rads@xmath13 bumps evident in the 2004 - 5 power spectra .",
    "an additional feature at @xmath21rads@xmath13 is also evident , albeit at a low power , in the 2005 spectrum .",
    "both these bumps are either absent or less evident in the 2000 - 3 and 2006 spectra , although several do possess a significant ` knee ' near @xmath22rads@xmath13 .",
    "analysis of similar power spectra taken on calibrator sources allow us to be confident that the power spectrum is not dominated by telescope noise and systematic effects down to angular frequencies @xmath23rads@xmath13 ( see macquart & de bruyn 2006 ) .",
    "another set of observations taken on 26 - 31 mar over the period 2001 - 6 ( see fig.[marobsns ] for a comparison between mar 2004 - 5 variations with the 21 feb 2004 variations ) shows a similar recent increase in the amount of small scale structure in the lightcurves , but we shall concentrate on the analysis of the february datasets in this paper .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "during 2004 - 5 fast , @xmath24min , variations emerged over the @xmath25min variations normally observed in the lightcurve of the scintillating quasar j1819@xmath03845 . in 2006",
    "the source reverted to variations similar to those in 2000 - 3 .",
    "the changes are best explained in terms of evolution in the source structure .",
    "a double - component source is capable of explaining the power spectra during 2004 - 5 .",
    "the spectral peak at @xmath26rads@xmath13 corresponding to the large amplitude , slow variations and visible in all spectra , is explained by oscillations of the ` fresnel filter ' , from which a @xmath27pc distance to the scattering medium is deduced .",
    "holding the scintillation velocity fixed at the value derived by db03 yields @xmath28 , while fitting also for @xmath29 yields @xmath30pc .",
    "the fast variations in 2004 - 5 are best attributed to oscillations in the source visibility function caused by a double - source structure with a component separation of @xmath31as in 2004 . from a fit to the 2006 spectrum one infers a separation of @xmath32as .",
    "this implies an apparent expansion speed of @xmath33 over the two years separating the two observations .",
    "however , we caution that it is also possible to fit the 2006 spectrum with in a single component , in which case no expansion speed can be derived .    the emergence of these fast variations preceded other changes in the source , namely an increase in the modulation index and then the intrinsic flux density .",
    "the appearance of new structure may be connected with the diffractive scintillation reported at 21 cm ( macquart & de bruyn 2006 ) , but as absolute astrometry is not possible using scintillation techniques one can not determine the angular offset between the components responsible for 6 and 21 cm variations .",
    "the proximity of the scattering screen and the large amplitude of the intensity variations requires the scattering turbulence to possess an amplitude @xmath34 if localized to a region of thickness no more than 0.4pc , 10% of its distance .",
    "this exceeds @xmath35 values deduced from most scattered pulsars ( cordes et al .",
    "1988 ) by over two orders of magnitude .",
