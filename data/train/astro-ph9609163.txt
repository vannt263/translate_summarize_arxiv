    "the presence of ubiquitous x - ray absorption in cooling flow ( cf ) clusters was first discovered by white et al .",
    "( 1991 ) using the _ einstein _ solid state spectrometer ( sss ) , and was later verified using _ exosat _ , _ rosat _ , and _ asca _ ( e.g. allen et al .",
    "1992 ; fabian et al .",
    "the typical observed columns are a few @xmath7 to a few @xmath8  @xmath9 .",
    "searches were conducted at other wavelengths in order to verify the presence of the absorber and to understand its nature .",
    "emission line constraints rule out absorbing gas at @xmath10  k , and thus the absorbing gas must be mostly h  i and/or h@xmath11 . extensive searches for h  i absorption using the 21  cm hyperfine structure line ( e.g. jaffe 1990 ; dwarakanath , van gorkom , & owen 1994 ) and searches for co associated with h@xmath11 ( e.g. odea et al .",
    "1994 ; antonucci & barvainis 1994 ) yielded upper limits typically well below the x - ray columns .",
    "the 21  cm limits are linear with the electron excitation temperature , and may thus be subject to significant uncertainty .",
    "for example , in the case of ngc  1275 , the central galaxy in the perseus cf cluster , the x - ray column obtained by the _ einstein _",
    "sss is @xmath12  @xmath9 ( white et al .",
    "1991 ) , by _ exosat _",
    "@xmath13  @xmath9 ( allen et al . 1991 ) , and by _ asca _",
    "@xmath14  @xmath9 ( fabian et al . 1994 ) . the 21  cm line , however , indicates an h  i column of only @xmath15  @xmath9 ( jaffe 1990 ) .    in this paper",
    "we show that significantly tighter limits on @xmath16 can be obtained using ly@xmath0 .",
    "we first make a short comparison of the absorption properties of ly@xmath0 versus the 21  cm line .",
    "we then apply the results of curve of growth analysis for ly@xmath0 to show that the h  i column @xmath17  kpc away from the center of ngc  1275 is significantly smaller than indicated by the 21  cm line , and demonstrate that improved limits can be obtained with a higher quality uv spectrum .",
    "we end with a short discussion of the implications of the new upper limits on @xmath16 on the nature of the x - ray absorber .",
    "in this section we compare the absorption properties of lyman @xmath0 versus the 21  cm line . in a two level atom",
    "the absorption cross section per atom is : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the oscillator strength , and @xmath20 is the line profile function ( voigt function for pure thermal broadening ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 is the correction for stimulated emission given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the population and degeneracy of level i. the level population is accurately described by the boltzmann ratio since collisions dominate both excitations and deexcitaions , and thus @xmath24 or @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "the value of the line profile function at line center is @xmath27 assuming a gaussian line shape ( i.e. thermal broadening ) , where @xmath28 is the line width and @xmath29 is the doppler parameter ( rybicki & lightman 1979 )",
    ".    table 1 compares the values of the parameters discussed above for ly@xmath0 versus the 21  cm line .",
    ".ly@xmath0 versus 21  cm absorption line parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the ratio of line center absorption cross sections is therefore @xmath30 and since @xmath31  k , ly@xmath0 is @xmath32 times more sensitive to h  i absorption than the 21  cm line , if both absorption lines are optically thin . note that when @xmath33 , the ly@xmath0 line becomes optically thick , and the absorption equivalent width @xmath34 increases only as @xmath35 .",
    "figure 1 presents a comparison of the absorption profiles of the 21  cm line vs. ly@xmath0 for @xmath36  @xmath9 .",
    "note the large difference in absorption ew of the two lines .",
    "jaffe ( 1990 ) measured in ngc  1275 21  cm absorption with @xmath37 and fwhm=477  km  s@xmath3 ( i.e. @xmath38  km  s@xmath3 ) . the expected ly@xmath0 absorption profile for @xmath16 at various @xmath39",
    "is displayed in figure 2 ,    indicating that for all @xmath39 one expects a very broad absorption trough with fwhm@xmath40  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the ly@xmath0 region in ngc  1275 was observed by johnstone & fabian ( 1995 ) , and the observed spectrum is displayed in figure 2 ( velocity scale is relative to 5260  km  s@xmath3 ) . clearly , the absorption predicted based on the 21  cm @xmath16 is not present .",
    "the small trough at the center of ly@xmath0 suggests absorption with ew@xmath41   , or @xmath42  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "johnstone & fabian ( 1995 ) suggested that ly@xmath0 is double peaked , rather than absorbed , in which case the absorption ew would be @xmath43   .",
    "clearly , ly@xmath0 implies a much lower values for @xmath16 than the 21  cm line . to obtain",
    "the @xmath16 implied by ly@xmath0 one needs to calculate ew(@xmath16 ) , i.e. use the standard `` curve of growth '' analysis .",
    "figure 3 displays on the left hand side the ly@xmath0 ew versus @xmath16 for various values of the @xmath44 parameter ( assuming a gaussian velocity distribution ) .",
    "the ew increases linearly with @xmath16 when the line is optically thin , saturating to ew@xmath45 when the line becomes optically thick , and recovering back to ew@xmath46 when the lorenztian wings dominate the absorption ( ` damped ' absorption ) .",
    "the observed absorption ew of 120  km  s@xmath3 translates to @xmath47  @xmath9 , where the upper limit is obtain if @xmath48  km  s@xmath3 , and the lower limit is obtained if @xmath49  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the right hand side curves in figure 3 represent the curves of growth for 21  cm absorption by h  i at @xmath50  k. these curves are identical to those for ly@xmath0 absorption , but shifted by a factor of @xmath51 to the right hand side .",
    "the observed 21  cm absorption ew translates to @xmath52  @xmath9 for a reasonable lower limit of @xmath50  k. the largest column allowed by ly@xmath0 is therefore @xmath4 times smaller than indicated by the 21  cm line .",
    "the apparent contradiction between the 21  cm and the ly@xmath0 columns can be understood if the h  i column is highly non - uniform , and the spatial distributions of the background 21  cm and ly@xmath0 emission are different .",
    "there is observational evidence that both these effects are present in ngc  1275 . according to the 21  cm continuum map presented by jaffe ( 1990 ) most of the continuum originates within @xmath53 of the center .",
    "fabian , nulsen , & arnaud ( 1984 ) discovered with iue that ly@xmath0 is also extended on @xmath54 scale , and the recent hut observations by van dyke dixon , davidsen , & ferguson ( 1996 ) indicate that ly@xmath0 emission of comparable surface brightness extends out to @xmath55 from the center .",
    "evidence for spatially non - uniform absorption is seen on much smaller scales in the vlba observations of walker et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and vermeulen et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , who discovered a free - free absorbed counter jet to the north of the nucleus .",
    "the counter jet is most likely seen through a large column disk of relatively cold gas close to the center of ngc  1275 ( levinson et al .",
    "1995 ) , while the line of sight to the southren jet is clear .",
    "the large @xmath16 indicated by the 21  cm line most likely resides on scales smaller than the @xmath17  kpc scale of the ly@xmath0 emitting filaments .",
    "the low @xmath16 indicated by ly@xmath0 provides a constraint for the @xmath56  kpc scale absorber indicated by the x - ray observations .",
    "the various x - ray telescopes mentioned above indicate an excess absorbing column of @xmath57  @xmath9 , and a covering factor close to unity .",
    "such a column becomes optically thick at @xmath58  kev . at this energy range",
    "o is the dominant absorber ( e.g. morrison & mccammon 1983 ) .",
    "thus , the x - ray spectra merely indicate the presence of an o column of @xmath59  @xmath9 .",
    "the o x - ray absorption is done by the inner k shell electrons , thus the ionization state of the o can be anywhere from o  i to o  vii .",
    "the x - ray and ly@xmath0 constraints imply that whatever is producing the absorption on the @xmath60  kpc scale in the perseus cooling flow cluster must have @xmath61 , i.e. it is drastically different from a neutral , solar abundance absorber , where @xmath62 .",
    "if the absorber has roughly solar abundance then h must be highly ionized with @xmath63 .",
    "can h be so highly ionized ?",
    "the available ionizing flux is far too low for significant photoionization .",
    "collisional ionization requires @xmath64  k , where the upper limit prevents o from being too highly ionized .",
    "however , this temperature range is excluded based on the absence of significant line emission ( e.g. voit & donahue 1995 ) .",
    "it thus appears that the required ionization state of h is ruled out .",
    "the above constraints on @xmath39 assume equilibrium ionization states .",
    "it remains to be studied whether plausible deviations from ionization equilibrium can significantly affect the ionization state of h.    another possibility is that the absorber has practically no h. this would be the case if the absorption originates in o which resides in dust grains embeded in hot gas .",
    "however , the dust sputtering time scales appear too short to explain the absorption in the inner parts of clusters ( dwek et al .",
    "1990 ; voit & donahue 1995 )",
    ".    could most of the h be in molecular form ?",
    "co emission was detected in the perseus cf ( e.g. braine et al . 1995 ) indicating that some of the h is indeed in molecular form .",
    "however , the h  i / h@xmath11 fraction needs to be @xmath65 , while theoretical calculations ( ferland et al .",
    "1994 ) indicate that most of h ( @xmath66% ) would be in atomic form , even in extremely cold clouds embeded in cfs .",
    "it therefore appears that there is no satisfactory model which explains the x - ray absorption together with the new tight limits on @xmath16 obtained from ly@xmath0 .",
    "given the difficulty in finding a plausible explanation for the x - ray absorption , it is crucial to verify that this absorption is indeed real .",
    "this can be achieved by the detection of an o bound - free k edge at the cf cluster redshift ( see sarazin , these proceedings ) .",
    "the edge energy will also indicate the ionization state of the absorber .",
    "this can be achieved with next generation high resolution x - ray telescopes .    on a shorter time scale ,",
    "significantly better constraints on @xmath16 in ngc  1275 can be obtained with hst .",
    "currently , the actual value of @xmath16 in ngc  1275 is uncertain by nearly 4 orders of magnitude , and a much more accurate determination can be achieved through a higher resolution uv spectrum , as demonstrated in figure 4 .",
    "the method described here can be extended to many more cf clusters .",
    "all cf clusters have a large cd galaxy at their center , and these galaxies tend to have a power - law continuum source at their center with significant uv emission which can be used for the detection of ly@xmath0 absorption .",
    "in addition , significant ly@xmath0 emission most likely originates from the emission line filaments present in all cf clusters . for example , hu ( 1992 ) observed 10 cf cluster with the iue , detecting significant ly@xmath0 emission in 7 clusters , thus demonstrating that the method described here can be applied to most cf clusters .",
    "the disadvantage of using the central cd galaxy is that if absorption is detected it may be produced by gas local to the cd or the emission line filaments , rather than the large scale absorber .",
    "the lack of significant absorption can , however , be used to place stringent limits on the nature of the x - ray absorber .",
    "this research was partly supported by the e. and j. bishop research fund , and by the milton and lillian edwards academic lectureship fund .",
