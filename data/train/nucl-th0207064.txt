    "over the last decade , a considerable effort has been made to understand the phenomenon of production of multiple intermediate - mass fragments ( imf ) in individual nuclear reaction events . yet , in spite of this effort , understanding of this process is still far from being satisfactory .",
    "for example , a consensus is still lacking on even such a fundamental issue of whether the fragment production is dominantly a statistical or a dynamical process . to a certain extent ,",
    "such lack of consensus is due to the fact that different models , promoting conflicting production scenarios , appear equally successful in describing select subsets of experimental observations .",
    "the present study is driven by the realization that statistical models that have been used in the interpretation of nuclear multifragmentation data @xcite fail to provide a coherent or satisfactory imf production scenario . among other things ,",
    "they fail to overcome the fundamental difficulty of traditional equilibrium - statistical decay models @xcite in explaining how imf production can effectively compete with nucleon and light - charged particle production , when the imf emission barriers are many tens of mev high , compared to @xmath0 6 mev for protons .",
    "it was the inability of these statistical decay models to explain the imf production rates that gave rise to the attractive speculation that multiple imf production could be a manifestation of the liquid - gas phase transition in finite nuclear matter .",
    "this is so , because one would expect a gas of nucleons enclosed in a container of sufficiently large size to equilibrate under certain circumstances into a mix of nucleons , light - charged particles , and imfs .",
    "this would be a process essentially analogous to condensation of a gas into liquid droplets .",
    "if this were the case , the abundance of imfs could be large and , perhaps , comparable to that observed experimentally .",
    "for many years , speculations regarding the relevance of the liquid - gas transition for what is termed nuclear multifragmentation have driven studies of this latter phenomenon .",
    "so far , however , scrutiny of practical models featuring such a phase transition @xcite has revealed significant gaps in the chain of reasoning leading to the `` prediction '' of an experimentally observable liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "for example , models based on the concept of an existence of a freeze - out configuration @xcite utilize in their formalisms a `` thought '' container with ideally reflecting walls , the boundary of the freeze - out volume .",
    "reflection of any outgoing flux of nucleons and light - charged particles ( lcp ) back into the freeze - out volume , @xcite is crucial for the models allowing particles to eventually form bigger clusters , the intermediate - mass fragments .",
    "however , since there is no known physical boundary defining such a freeze - out volume , or mechanism by which imfs could pass the high saddle of emission barriers , the predicted imf abundance must be considered an artifact of the modelling itself .    similarly severe are shortcomings of approaches utilizing percolation @xcite or fisher s model , @xcite which have recently been applied @xcite to nuclear multifragmentation .",
    "@xcite notably , these models do not even address the issue of the high coulomb barrier inhibiting fragment emission .",
    "the presence of a high barrier is obvious even in the vicinity of the critical point , where the expected matter density ( in the range of 1/3  1/2 of ground - state matter density ) is still high enough to trap any fragment formed inside the expanded nuclear system in very much the same way as it would trap fragments formed at ground state density . in the case of fisher s model ,",
    "largely overlooked remains the fact that , by design , the formalism is limited to events in which there is no more than one cluster present at any time , with the balance of the system being always in a state of a homogenous , monomeric gas of individual molecules . while such `` either - zero - or - one - fragment '' events may be essential in a condensation theory , such as represented by fisher s model , they are of little , if any , interest in the context of nuclear multifragmentation .    a somewhat different statistical approach to explaining high yields of imfs observed in energetic nuclear reactions was adopted in the expanding - emitting source model ( eesm ) .",
    "@xcite this model considers dynamic , isentropic , self - similar expansion of a nuclear system to densities below the equilibrium density proper for the given total excitation energy , where it finds enhanced fragment emission probabilities .",
    "however , as pointed out recently , @xcite the eesm formalism unjustifiably derives most of the ( collective ) energy necessary for a fragment to overcome the coulomb emission barrier , not from a thermal heat bath , as prescribed by weisskopf s approach , @xcite but from a thermally isolated single , compressional degree of freedom .",
    "the above discussion emphasizes the need for an alternative scenario of statistical imf emission .",
    "the present study demonstrates that a simple scenario , closely related to that known from fission studies , offers an explanation of how at moderately high excitation energies , imf emission can compete effectively with nucleon evaporation .",
    "it represents an extension of ideas and formalism presented in a recent publication .",
    "@xcite central to this formalism is the notion of a relatively high entropy associated with the diffuse nuclear surface region ( as opposed to bulk matter ) .",
    "note that it is also the increased surface entropy that enhances the fission probability of a heavy nucleus relative to nucleon evaporation .",
    "this latter enhancement is commonly described in terms of the ratio @xmath1 of level density parameters for saddle and ground - state configurations , respectively .",
    "the formalism adopted in the present study is described in detail in section  [ sec : formalism ] . while this formalism is somewhat schematic , it is believed to capture the essential physics underlying the processes involved .",
    "one benefit of such a schematic treatment is that it provides a direct insight into the phenomena of interest , disregarding a multitude of secondary details demanded by a more rigorous approach .",
    "results of calculations are presented in section  [ sec : results ] , while the conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the present study assumes that an excited nuclear system expands in a self - similar fashion so as to reach a state of approximate thermodynamical equilibrium , where the entropy @xmath2 is maximal for the given total excitation energy @xmath3 , i.e. ,    @xmath4    the functional dependence of entropy on @xmath3 and the bulk nuclear matter density @xmath5 is evaluated using the fermi - gas model relationship    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the level density parameter , @xmath8 is the thermal excitation energy and @xmath9 is the collective compressional energy .",

    "the above equation holds approximately also for finite nuclei if the expansion or compression of these nuclei is assumed to occur in a self - similar fashion .",
    "this is so because for finite nuclei , the little-@xmath7 parameter consists @xcite of volume and surface terms , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , both of which are proportional to @xmath15 under the assumption of self - similar expansion :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are volume and surface coefficients , respectively , independent of bulk nuclear matter density .",

    "the presence of a surface contribution to the level density parameter is of crucial importance in the present study as it describes the part @xmath22 of entropy @xmath2 of the system associated with the diffuse surface domain and is seen to have significant effect on the fragment emission probability .",

    "note that at both these extremal points , the pressure of the system at its surface is zero .",

    "as seen in this figure , already at excitation energies per nucleon of the order of 3 mev / nucleon , fragment emission begins to compete effectively with proton emission and , then , at higher excitation energies , fragment emission becomes the dominant decay mode .",

    "[ fig : z_spectra ] , above the dashed line , reflect dynamical instability with respect to the fragment emission mode .",

    ", it was assumed that the mass number of the fragment is twice the atomic number , i.e. , @xmath72 .",
    "since the magnitude of the effective barrier depends on the excitation energy and , thus , on temperature @xmath40 , and since @xmath40 is a non - monotonic function of @xmath3 , one would expect the fragment emission probabilities @xmath42 to deviate significantly from a simple arrhenius law with an exponential functional dependence on the inverse temperature @xmath73 .",

    "therefore , no simple explanation for such a linearity can be offered at this time , the very rationale behind the construction of such pseudo - arrhenius plots being numerous experimental findings .",
    "@xcite while it may be purely fortuitous , the linear character of pseudo - arrhenius plots predicted by the present formalism seems to be in agreement with experimental observations .",

    "a formalism has been developed to describe quantitatively , albeit in a schematic fashion , a scenario of purely statistical emission of massive fragments from finite equilibrated systems .",
    "the formalism recognizes the importance of thermal expansion of hot matter and considers the stability of such systems at equilibrium nuclear densities .",
    "the important role of surface entropy consists in an effective `` softening '' of the nuclear surface , resulting in enhanced fragment emission probabilities .",
    "the decay scenario underlying this formalism is that of a thermally expanded system with developed thermal fluctuations of the diffuse surface .",
    "within such a scenario , fragment emission is naturally viewed as analogous to fission .",
    "the calculations performed within the framework of the proposed formalism show that , with increasing excitation energy and mostly due to effects of increased surface entropy , the effective barriers for fragment emission decrease and , eventually , vanish . as no equivalent decrease is expected for nucleons and light charged particles , one expects that at high excitation energies , fragment emission competes effectively with nucleon and lcp emission .",
    "the formalism presented here also predicts an occurrence of negative heat capacity in highly excited nuclear systems . it also predicts linear pseudo - arrhenius plots , where the logarithm of the fragment emission probability , @xmath74 , is plotted _ versus _ the inverse square - root of the excitation energy , @xmath76 .",
    "this latter prediction is found in agreement with numerous experimental observations .",
    "@xcite however , as also expected , the formalism predicts non - linear true arrhenius plots , where the independent variable is the inverse temperature , @xmath73 , rather than @xmath76 .",
    "this is so , because the effective emission barriers depend rather strongly on excitation energy ( and temperature ) and , hence , fail to satisfy one of the fundamental prerequisites of the arrhenius law .",
    "the simplicity of the presented formalism should allow one to incorporate it into existing statistical decay codes . for purposes where the ultimate goal is to obtain an agreement with experimental data",
    ", it would be desirable , however , to improve the formalism itself . for example",
    ", one should use more realistic ( and lower ) saddle - point energies , instead of the schematic coulomb energies of touching spheres .",
    "one should also be mindful of differences in equilibration times for nucleon and lcp emission modes , on the one hand , and for different imf emission and fission modes , on the other hand .",
    "it is natural to expect that modes requiring major rearrangement of mass require longer times to equilibrate than modes that do not require such a rearrangement .",
    "consequently , one would expect all imf emission modes to attain equilibrium later than nucleon emission modes , and fission modes to reach equilibrium even later . as a result , early in the decay process , while the imf degree of freedom is approaching equilibrium , one would expect to see `` pre - imf nucleons '' , in much the same way as one sees pre - fission neutrons .",
    "@xcite similarly , one would expect to see pre - fission imf emission in situations when for the same systems at equilibrium , fission would dominate .",
    "importantly , the latter pre - fission imf emission modes may succeed in removing enough charge and excitation energy from the system so as to pre - empt fission altogether - a phenomenon that has recently been observed experimentally ."
