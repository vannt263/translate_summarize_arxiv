    "recent success controlling complex dynamics of nonlinear physical and chemical systems  @xcite has opened the door for the control of biological rhythms . some researchers have speculated about the medical implications of controlling heart - rate dynamics or brain rhythms  @xcite .",
    "however , biological systems typically have characteristics that require special consideration .",
    "for example , biological control studies to date  @xcite have required that the control interventions be unidirectional  only allowing shortening of a parameter .",
    "such a restriction is somewhat analogous to trying to balance a broomstick vertically on one s palm using horizontal hand movements in only one direction .",
    "intuitively , one might expect that such a restriction would limit controllability .",
    "however , as we will demonstrate in this paper , such a restriction introduces some surprising complexity to the stability properties of controlled one - dimensional map systems .",
    "in fact , the unidirectional restriction can actually improve the controllability of some systems  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will show how restricted control can introduce stability zones that do not exist in the unrestricted case .",
    "furthermore , we will show that some of these zones were present in recent cardiac control experiments  @xcite .",
    "finally , we will exploit the structure of the stability zones in robust new control algorithms that automatically adapt the control feedback parameter .",
    "in this study we will consider the control of systems whose dynamics can be described by one - dimensional maps : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the variable to be controlled and @xmath2 is an experimentally accessible system parameter .",
    "the goal is to stabilize the system state point @xmath3 $ ] about an unstable period-1 fixed point @xmath4 $ ] , where @xmath5 , by perturbing @xmath2 by an amount : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the feedback gain parameter .",
    "the advantage of such a control scheme is that relatively little _ a priori _ system information is required to implement control and stabilize @xmath8 .",
    "the only requirement is knowledge of the sign of @xmath9 so that perturbations can be applied in the correct direction .",
    "in fact , knowledge of the value of @xmath8 is unnecessary because the controlled system s fixed point is identical to that of the uncontrolled system .",
    "furthermore , if the fixed point drifts during the course of the control ( as is common for biological systems ) , the controlled system will track the fixed point , provided that the system stays in the stable range of the feedback gain parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the control algorithm of eq .",
    "[ eqn : deltalambda ] is an example of delayed feedback control , a technique that has been used in a variety of modeling and experimental studies  @xcite . in section  [ sec : avnexperiments ] we will present an example of a biological system with constraints that restrict the control algorithm  only allowing unidirectional perturbations of @xmath2 .",
    "the purpose of this study is to examine the implications of such a restriction .",
    "for unrestricted control , in which @xmath10 can be positive or negative , linearizing the controlled system about a fixed point at the origin gives : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the eigenvalues of eq .",

    "the fixed point is stable provided that both eigenvalues fall inside the unit circle .",
    "this condition is met when : @xmath15 for @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "note that the stability zone shrinks to zero for @xmath17 , thereby limiting the applicability of the unrestricted control algorithm to maps with a sufficiently shallow slope ( i.e. , @xmath18 ) at @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath19 there exists no real value for @xmath20 such that the eigenvalues fall within the unit circle .",
    "thus , unstable positively - sloped fixed points can not be stabilized .",
    "restricting the above control algorithm by only allowing shortening of @xmath2 gives the following controller : @xmath21 where    @xmath22    thus , when @xmath23 the control is active ( i.e. , a perturbation is delivered ) , and when @xmath24 the control is inactive ( i.e. , no perturbation is given ) .",
    "the restricted control algorithm of eq .",
    "[ eqn : restrictdeltalambda ] gives the following linearized controlled system : @xmath25 geometrically , the restriction of eq .",
    "[ eqn : cond ] means that perturbations will only be applied if the state point @xmath26 lies above the return - map line of identity @xmath27 .",
    "the dynamical effects of this restriction depend on the sign of the slope at @xmath8 .",
    "typical dynamics of restricted control for negatively - sloped unstable directions ( @xmath29 ) are depicted in fig  [ fig : x_return_a_below_minus1 ] .",
    "this figure shows eight control trials of a linear map with @xmath30 for different values of @xmath20 ; there are four examples of stable control and four examples of unstable control .    figure  [ fig : x_return_a_below_minus1](a ) shows a case in which the restricted control algorithm failed to stabilize the unstable fixed point @xmath8 [ which is located at the intersection of the uncontrolled system map ( solid line ) and the line of identity ( dotted line ) , and is denoted by a solid triangle ] with @xmath31 .",
    "the dot - dash lines correspond to the system maps when @xmath2 is perturbed .",
    "a series of arrows originate at the initial state point and connect consecutive state points ( solid circles , numbered consecutively ) . in this case , the initial state point ( @xmath32 ) is followed by a control intervention , which causes the next iterate ( @xmath33 ) to fall below the line of identity . according to eq .",

    "thus , control is applied every other iterate so that the sequence of @xmath36 is 0101 .... in this case , the fixed point is not stabilized because control fails to direct the system closer to the fixed point ( i.e. , the arrows spiral away from @xmath8 ) .    figure  [ fig : x_return_a_below_minus1](b ) shows control with the same value of @xmath37 , but using a slightly more negative @xmath20 value , @xmath38 . for these parameter settings",

    "the second controlled iterate ( @xmath34 ) is below the line of identity and below the fixed point , thereby producing the 011011 ... sequence . in this case , the fixed point is not stabilized because the control perturbations moved the state point away from the fixed point . however , when @xmath20 is decreased to @xmath44 , as seen in fig .",

    "figure [ fig : x_return_a_below_minus1](g ) shows the stable 00110011 ... case for @xmath45 .",
    "the 00110011 ... sequence becomes unstable as @xmath20 is decreased still further ; figure  [ fig : x_return_a_below_minus1](h ) depicts this case for @xmath46 .",
    "the progression of unstable and stable periodic control sequences continues indefinitely as @xmath20 is decreased .",
    "in fact , the switching parameter @xmath36 imposes the following progression of control sequences as @xmath20 is decreased from zero : unstable @xmath47 , stable @xmath47 , stable @xmath48 , unstable @xmath48 , unstable @xmath49 , stable @xmath49 , stable @xmath50 , unstable @xmath50 , ... , unstable @xmath51 , stable @xmath51 , stable @xmath52 , unstable @xmath52 , where @xmath53 denotes @xmath54 consecutive ones ( control perturbations ) before the sequence repeats itself .",

    "the boundaries of the stability zones can be computed by using the criterion that stable sequences move the system closer to the fixed point after one control sequence . because @xmath55 is the last iterate of the first @xmath61 control sequence and @xmath64 is the last iterate of the first @xmath63 sequence , the stability conditions are @xmath65 and @xmath66 for the @xmath61 and @xmath63 sequences , respectively .",
    "therefore , the boundaries are given by @xmath54 degree polynomials in @xmath20 .",
    "for example , the @xmath67 control sequences are stable for @xmath68 for @xmath69  @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : beta_vs_a_below_minus1 ] depicts the stability zones ( shaded regions ) for @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",

    "these curves mark the optimal parameter values for a given stability region , because the fixed point is reached after a single control sequence @xmath61 .",
    "the striking feature of this analysis is that the domain of control is extended by the restriction of eq .",

    "in fact , fig .  [",
    "fig : beta_vs_a_below_minus1 ] shows that for all @xmath29 , stable control sequences exist for the restricted system .",
    "this is in contrast with the unrestricted system , for which stable control sequences exist only for @xmath73 , as shown by the dashed triangular region marking its stability zone ( according to eq .",
    "[ eqn : unrestzone ] ) .    while there are an infinite number of stable zones corresponding to an arbitrary number @xmath54 consecutive control perturbations , the stability zones are bounded by the curve @xmath74 .",
    "this boundary is computed by recognizing that as @xmath54 approaches infinity , control is always active and @xmath75 for every iterate . thus , the algorithm behaves just like the unrestricted control of eq .",

    "[ fig : x_return_a_above_1](c ) .",
    "such control is successful for a noise - free model system .",

    "thus , @xmath84 marks the boundary between the @xmath51 and @xmath47 sequences .",

    "@xcite , we have studied the control of a particular cardiac conduction interval , known as the atrioventricular ( av ) nodal conduction time , in _ in vitro _ rabbit heart experiments . because of the nonlinear excitation properties of av - nodal tissue , the dynamics of av - nodal conduction can bifurcate from a period-1 regime ( where every impulse propagates through the av - node at the same rate ) to a period-2 regime ( where propagation time alternates in a long , short , long , etc .",

    "the goal in ref .",
    "@xcite was to eliminate the alternating rhythm by stabilizing the underlying period one fixed point @xmath93 .",
    "this was achieved by delivering electrical stimuli to the atrial tissue in order to transiently shorten @xmath92 . because there is no practical way to lengthen @xmath92 , the timing of the electrical stimuli was determined by the restricted controller of eq .",

    "@xcite was not linear , application of the restricted control algorithm resulted in several of the control sequences predicted in the above linear system for @xmath28 .",

    "[ fig : hall_97a_fig](a ) ) , the system shifted to a stable @xmath48 sequence that eliminated the alternation of @xmath1 .",
    "after the fourth perturbation to @xmath92 ( beat 303 ) , the system shifted to a stable @xmath47 sequence .",
    "this shift resulted from the close proximity of the @xmath47 and @xmath48 stable zones ( fig .",
    "[ fig : beta_vs_a_below_minus1 ] ) ; noise or drift in the system can cause such transitions .",
    "figure  [ fig : hall_97a_fig](c ) shows a stable @xmath50 control sequence that eliminated the alternation of @xmath1 in a different rabbit heart using @xmath98 .",
    "( note that the @xmath7 values from distinct trials are independent . )",
    "similar to the sequence transitions in fig .",
    "[ fig : hall_97a_fig](b ) , the system switched to its adjacent stable @xmath49 control sequence shortly after the control was initiated , and later switched back to the stable @xmath50 control sequence .",
    "figure  [ fig : hall_97a_fig](a ) ( unsuccessful ) and ( b ) ( successful ) demonstrate that successful control is dependent on the proper choice of @xmath7 .",
    "such dependence is a critical limitation given that the information required to determine the correct value of @xmath7 ( @xmath37 , @xmath8 , and @xmath99 ) can not be easily determined prior to control .",
    "furthermore , the nonstationarities typical of biological systems imply that the appropriate value of @xmath7 may drift over time , thereby increasing the likelihood of control failure if @xmath7 is fixed . to eliminate the limitations of a fixed @xmath7 value chosen prior to control ,",
    "we have developed a new technique that adaptively estimates @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "this adaptive approach is especially appropriate for applications ( e.g. , cardiac arrhythmia control ) that can not afford control failure of the type shown in the control attempt of fig .  [ fig : hall_97a_fig](a ) .",
    "this new technique exploits the structure of the stability zones to automatically adapt @xmath7 such that @xmath8 is stabilized more robustly . because multiple perturbations away from the fixed point are not desirable",
    ", the optimal stability zone is the @xmath70 zone .",

    "the system subsequently escaped control for about 30 iterates before control was recaptured and maintained until the algorithm was deactivated at @xmath147 .",
    "the adaptive feedback gain algorithm is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cubedrift ] , which shows control of a drifting cubic map with @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "control was activated for @xmath150 .",
    "the fixed point was controlled successfully during this period .",
    "the fixed point location does not change for the drifting cubic map , but the system drifts into the chaotic regime by the end of the control period .",
    "surprisingly , the typical biological restriction of unidirectional control perturbations enhances the controllability of fixed points with @xmath28 in systems described by one - dimensional maps .",
    "because biological systems typically drift over time , dynamic control algorithms must adapt to system nonstationarities .",
    "although the restricted delayed feedback control technique allows for moderate tracking of the fixed point as long as the system remains within a stability zone , it is ill - suited for systems with significant drift . for such systems ,",
    "automatic adaptation of the feedback gain parameter ensures that the drifting system is directed to , and remains within , the largest stability zone .",
    "thus , with the dual benefits of the increased stability of unidirectional restricted control and the adaptability of on - the - fly gain estimation , such control techniques could be of significant value to the control of biological systems .",
    "indeed , a recent set of clinical experiments  @xcite have shown that adaptive restricted control of this type can successfully eliminate the same alternating av - nodal conduction rhythm that was controlled in the rabbit experiments of ref .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that simple modifications of the restricted control algorithm can control fixed points with @xmath19  an impossible task for the unrestricted feedback controller .",
    "thus , this algorithm may also have applicability in physical systems that allow bidirectional perturbations .",
    "this work was supported , in part , by a grant from the american heart association ( 0030028n ) [ djc ] .",

    "_ used an imposed @xmath47 sequence in order to control unstable orbits of laser dynamics .",
    "such a control scheme has the same @xmath47 stability boundaries as our control algorithm with the exception that for @xmath19 their imposed @xmath47 control sequence is stable , rather than semi - stable as with our restricted control .",
    "the advantage of the approach proposed here is that the control sequence information can be used to automatically adapt the gain parameter .",
