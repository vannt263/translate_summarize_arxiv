    "+ + + + + + + + + + +    since the early days of the quantum theory physicists have looked for ways to represent quantum states as probability distributions in the phase space , a procedure in which information about coordinate and momentum representations is encoded in one single function @xcite .",
    "this type of representation , thoroughly employed in classical statistical mechanics , is nowadays widely used to study quantum systems with applications in experimental photonics , quantum information , numerical semiclassical methods and other applied and theoretical fields .    in general",
    ", functions @xmath0 representing probability densities in the phase space satisfy the continuity equation @xmath1 where the divergence is taken with respect to the coordinates @xmath2 and momenta @xmath3 .",
    "this equation defines the probability current @xmath4 and the generation rates @xmath5 for @xmath0 , which can be either positive or negative .",
    "in classical mechanics @xmath6 due to probability conservation , and the equations of motion for the coordinates determine the current @xcite .",
    "for example , in an one - dimensional system @xmath7 where the dots indicate total derivative with respect to time .",
    "classical solutions of the equation ( [ eq : contgeneral ] ) can be obtained from an initial function @xmath0 and are given in terms of the trajectories governed by the equations of motion : @xmath8 ; where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the initial conditions of the trajectory ending at @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the time @xmath11 .",
    "these classical probability functions have two properties : their marginal distributions are the physical coordinate and momentum distributions and they are positive semi - definite , @xmath12 .    the quantum mechanical analog of this formulation uses phase space functions to represent states but the general solutions have different properties from that of the classical ones .",
    "firstly , it has long been known that any quantum function violates at least one of the two classical properties stated before .",
    "for example , the wigner function @xcite has as marginal distributions the wavefunctions of the state in the coordinate and momentum representations but it is not positive , and the husimi function @xcite is positive , but it does not have the wavefunctions as its marginal distributions .",
    "secondly , quantum solutions are not guided by trajectories because it is impossible to assess both coordinate and momentum for a given test particle , even though the quantum functions satisfy the continuity equation and have well a defined probability current @xcite . since authentic quantum trajectories do not exist as in the classical dynamics , in order to characterize both dynamical regimes in the phase space on the same grounds we need to attain the analysis on the probability flow itself .",

    "instead they are built by casting the von neumann equation for the dynamics of the states in some representation , in which the density operator of the state is mapped to the function @xmath0 in the phase space , where a suitable current @xmath4 is obtained . in recent years attention has been drawn to the topological structures the quantum current generates and the relations to its classical counterpart .",
    "so far it has been shown that the wigner current has a strict topological order in the dynamics of its stagnation points @xcite , and in a recent work the same kind of order was explored for the husimi function @xcite .",
    "the husimi function is obtained by averaging the density operator in a basis of gaussian coherent states and it can be interpreted as the probability of measuring the position and momentum of the quantum system within an uncertainty area centered in the basis state .",
    "this function inherits the analiticity of the coherent states , which restricts the dynamics of the stagnation points . in a previous work",
    "@xcite we presented a detailed demonstration of the construction of the husimi current for one - dimensional systems , and we showed that the current adds new topological structures to the dynamics when compared with its classical counterpart .",
    "we also conjectured that these new structures emerge because every zero of the husimi function is also a saddle point of the flow . in this paper",
    "we prove this conjecture and we explore the effects of this topological structures in a toy model .    specifically , we consider transmission through a gaussian barrier and show the connection between the classical and quantum transmission coefficients and the position of the zeros relative to the peaks of husimi function and the classical energy levels .",
    "it has already been observed that the emergence of zeros in the phase space is a signature of quantum interference @xcite ; our work adds another layer of comprehension of this signature by analysing a dynamical feature of the zeros .",

    "the identity operator in the coherent state representation is @xmath34 where the @xmath35 is the displacement invariant volume of the phase space .",
    "a quantum state represented by the density operator @xmath36 can be mapped to a phase space function by means of its average over coherent states : @xmath37 this is the husimi function of the quantum state , also called its @xmath0-symbol . if the state is pure the husimi function is the squared modulus of the wavefunction and is non - negative .",

    "our interest concerns the stagnation points of the flow , those points of the phase space where @xmath65 .",
    "in @xcite it was conjectured that the zeros of the husimi function are also saddle points of @xmath62 .",
    "this means that whenever a zero of the function occurs , there are topological differences between the classical and quantum probability flows induced by these new stagnation points , and the phase space dynamics of these regimes are different . in this section",
    "we prove that this conjecture is true , and we analyse how the existence of the saddle points can change the dynamical behaviour of a system.the quantum current ( [ eq : definitionj2 ] ) , like the classical one , has a gauge freedom under the transformation @xmath66 , for any phase space valued real function @xmath67 .",
    "apart from this gauge , in this work we regard ( [ eq : definitionj2 ] ) as the probability current associated to the husimi function due to its special factorization ( [ eq : factorizationj ] ) shown below .",

    "the point is a saddle of the flow , with an attractive and a repulsive direction ; in the latter , it is a vortex @xcite .",
    "for each stagnation point @xmath68 the topological characterization of the probability current can be done by the index @xmath81 of the flow , which counts the number of times the current rotates completely while we move clockwise around the point . taking a loop @xmath82 around @xmath68 containing no other stagnation point ,",
    "@xmath81 is calculated as the clockwise integral of the angle @xmath83 between the flow and some fixed reference axis in @xmath82 : @xmath84 one counterclockwise rotation of @xmath62 adds @xmath85 , whereas one clockwise rotation adds @xmath86 . in general , for saddle points @xmath87 and for vortices @xmath88 . in this way",

    "the movement of the husimi function is accompanied by the movement of its zeros . in view of the poincar - hopf theorem the total index of the flow",
    "must be conserved during the dynamics , thus the emergency of a saddle point must always be accompanied by the emergency of a non - trivial stagnation point ; for this reason stagnation points exist _ in pairs_.    in @xcite it has been observed that the stagnation points in the pair move closely to each other in the phase space and form a structure similar to the one depicted in figure 1 . since this structure is similar to a dipole with opposite charges , in this work we name it _",
    "topological dipole_. in the next section we analyse a toy model where the presence of the topological dipoles works as a signature of differences between two regimes of transmission across a potential barrier .",

    "it is possible to see a row of zeros in front of the maximum of the husimi function ( marked by an ellipse with the letters rz ) in a region where classical trajectories cross the potential barrier ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "the presence of the zeros causes the quantum flow to be highly distorted with respect to the classical flow .",

    "once again the row of zeros is visible , but this time they are situated in a region near the classical separatrix . below the separatrix , where the husimi function is large and the classical trajectories are reflected back , the zeros distort the flow again , allowing portions of the husimi function to cross it . notice that alongside with the last zero of the row , below the separatrix , is the vortex of the topological pair , allowing the flow to circulate around it and move to the other side of the separatrix .",

    "this particular model exhibited two particular possibilities of relative position , other systems could offer different situations to be explored .",
    "in this work we studied the dynamics of the husimi function and the role of its zeros in producing stagnation points of the corresponding phase space flow .",
    "we showed that the zeros are stagnation saddle points of the quantum probability flow , leading to new topological structures in the current when compared to the classical dynamics .",
    "these new stagnation points of the current are created in pairs due to topological restrictions , with indexes equal to @xmath86 and @xmath85 , so that each pair behaves as a topological dipole with total index equal to zero .    as an example we studied the scattering of a wave packet through a gaussian barrier , where two regimes of transmission can be identified according to the initial average momentum of the particle . for initial average kinetic energy below the barrier",
    "top the classical transmission is greater than the quantum one , whereas the quantum transmission is larger than the classical if the average kinetic energy is above the barrier top . in each case",
    "the relative position of the topological dipoles is different , accounting for the dynamical mechanism behind the differences between the classical and quantum flow .",
    "when the classical transmission is greater than the quantum , the dipoles are located in regions of the phase space where classical trajectories cross the barrier , partially blocking the transmission . when the quantum transmission is greater than the classical , the dipoles are situated near the classical separatrix and they offer a path for probability transmission across it , a classically forbidden mechanism .    the zeros of the husimi function have already been pointed out as signatures of quantum phenomena . understanding how these zeros change the phase space probability flow adds new information about the dynamical mechanisms of quantum phenomena in the phase space .",
