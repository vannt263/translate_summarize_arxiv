    "kac formula @xcite has played a fundamental role in the development of numerical algorithms capable of accounting for the physical properties of quantum systems made up of distinguishable particles . when utilized in tandem with the monte carlo integration technique ,",
    "a powerful method is obtained : the path - integral monte carlo @xcite , which is capable of probing the quantum effects without any untestable approximations .",

    ", @xmath4 is the density matrix for a one - dimensional canonical system characterized by the inverse temperature @xmath5 and made up of identical particles of mass @xmath6 moving in the potential @xmath7 .",
    "the stochastic element that appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq : i1 ] ) , @xmath8 , is a so - called standard brownian bridge , defined as follows : if @xmath9 is a standard brownian motion starting at zero , then the brownian bridge is the stochastic process  @xmath10 , i.e. , a brownian motion conditioned on the event  @xmath11 .",
    "as is well known , a brownian bridge can be realized as the process @xmath12 @xcite . to complete the description of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : i1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : i1p ] ) , we have @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    a problem of direct interest to the chemical physicist is the development of approximations supported on finite - dimensional probability spaces that have fast convergence for smooth enough potentials , as measured against the number of evaluations of the potential function .",
    "most desirably , such approximations should utilize only the potential function in their construction . for reasons of stability ,",
    "they should converge , perhaps at a slower rate , for all continuous potentials that are bounded from below . until recently ,",
    "the fastest method available ( as order of convergence ) has been the trapezoidal trotter discrete path integral method .",
    "the technique is usually derived by means of the lie  trotter product formula and an appropriate short - time high - temperature approximation . the formal asymptotic convergence of the trapezoidal trotter method and of related techniques was extensively studied by suzuki @xcite for bounded operators and by ichinose and tamura @xcite , among others . in particular , results of the last two authors @xcite",
    "show that the symmetric trotter ",
    "suzuki approximation has optimal convergence @xmath15 for sufficiently smooth potentials as far as pointwise convergence of their integral kernels is concerned .",
    "this type of convergence is also implied in the present paper .",
    "on the other hand , the non - existence theorem of suzuki @xcite makes it implausible that faster convergence can be achieved by utilizing short - time approximations constructed as functions of the kinetic and potential operators .",
    "recently , a more general approach has been put forward by the present author @xcite , who argued that , for sufficiently smooth potentials , there might exist direct short - time high - temperature approximations of arbitrary polynomial convergence order .",
    "of course , these short - time approximations are generally not functions of the kinetic and potential operators .",
    "the construction of such approximations is based upon an `` experimental '' theorem on the pointwise convergence of the integral kernels of the lie  trotter product formulas .",
    "although not rigorously proved , this theorem seems quite plausible .",
    "the short - time approximations considered are based on carefully designed finite - dimensional approximations to the brownian motion entering the feynman  kac formula .",
    "basically , the brownian motion is replaced by some discrete - time gaussian process that is supported on a finite - dimensional probability space .",
    "a set of functional equations involving some generalized moments of the gaussian process have been shown to control the order of convergence @xmath0 . because the number of equations increases in an exponential fashion with @xmath0 ,",
    "explicit solutions have been obtained only for @xmath16 .    in the present work ,",
    "we exploit the fact that both the brownian motion and its replacement are gaussian processes and are , therefore , uniquely determined by their covariance matrices .",
    "we thus show how to express the functional equations in terms of the covariance matrices alone .",
    "hopefully , the new equations will prove easier to utilize in a complete mathematical proof of the existence of short - time approximations of arbitrary order . in the appendix",

    "a simple proof of the convergence of this lie ",
    "trotter subsequence is given in the appendix ( see corollary  [ co:2 ] ) , again for continuous and bounded from below potentials .    a second requirement that we ask of the construction given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) has to do with the symmetry of the density matrix , which should reflect itself in the symmetry of the short - time approximation .",
    "as such , we require that the discrete probability measure @xmath43 defining the quadrature technique on @xmath35 $ ] must be symmetric about @xmath44 . also , the finite dimensional process @xmath45 must be invariant under the transformation @xmath46 .",
    "that is , we require the equality in distribution @xmath47 the time symmetry of the process @xmath48 can be enforced , for example , by restricting the functions @xmath41 to the class of symmetric and antisymmetric functions . to understand these requirements ,",
    "notice that the hermiticity of the density matrix stems from the symmetry of the lebesgue measure on @xmath35 $ ] as well as from the time symmetry of the standard brownian bridge @xmath49 , i.e. , the fact that @xmath50 is a brownian bridge equal in distribution to @xmath51 . because the random sum @xmath48 is intended as a replacement for the brownian bridge , it is convenient to introduce the notations @xmath52 thus , the brownian bridge ( motion ) is approximated by a simple gaussian process that is supported on a finite - dimensional probability space .",
    "moreover , only the values of the process for the discrete times represented by the quadrature knots @xmath53 , @xmath54 ,  , @xmath55 are relevant for the construction of the short - time approximation .",

    "this condition is necessary in order to ensure that we recover the original potential @xmath7 , derivatives @xmath67 , or products of such functions from their gaussian transforms , in the limit that @xmath68 ( see theorem  3 of ref .",
