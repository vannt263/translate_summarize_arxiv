    "the kalman filter , or the kalman filtering method , provides an efficient way to estimate the state of a linear dynamical system subject to gaussian white noise @xcite .",
    "it has been widely used in applications such as target tracking , parameter estimation , control theory , signal processing , and other data assimilation tasks .",
    "the kalman filter requires the noise be either gaussian or with finite variance @xcite , and thus it is not applicable to linear systems with non - gaussian noise of infinite variance .",
    "as non - gaussian lvy noise with infinite variance exists ubiquitously @xcite , it is desirable to study the kalman filtering problems under lvy noise . very little",
    "work has been done for this issue .",
    "breton and musiela @xcite presented a scheme for kalman filtering with noise of infinite variance , while assuming the contribution of the jumps are exactly known .",
    "the filter in @xcite is nonlinear and recursive , and thus may greatly limit its application in practice .",
    "ahn and feldman @xcite proposed to minimize the difference between the true state and the filtered observation in the @xmath0-norm .",
    "however , as pointed in @xcite , this method does not really address the kalman filtering problem which consists of combining forecasts and observations .",
    "the method in @xcite focuses on large errors and has a robust performance but high computational cost due to the matrix diagonalization and the operation of the fractional power in each step .",
    "this may also be an obstacle for real - time implementation in practical applications .",
    "note that in practice , each iteration step must be completed during every sampling period , and it is greatly desirable to make the algorithm as fast as possible .    in this paper",
    ", we will present an algorithm , which has the similar computational cost as that of the kalman filter , but can be applied to linear systems with non - gaussian lvy noise of infinite variance .",
    "we consider the following discrete time model with the state equation @xmath1 and the observation equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 , an @xmath4-by-@xmath5 vector , is the state variable , and @xmath6 , an @xmath7-by-@xmath5 vector , is the measurement ( or observation ) variable , @xmath8 represents the modeling error noise , @xmath9 the measurement error noise , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are @xmath4-by-@xmath4 and @xmath7-by-@xmath4 matrices , respectively .",
    "we only consider the cases where @xmath8 is a gaussian noise , and @xmath9 is a non - gaussian lvy noise .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in section 2",
    ", the usual kalman filter is briefly reviewed .",
    "the proposed modified kalman filter is presented in section 3 .",
    "a simulation example is provided in section 4 to illustrate the effectiveness of the modified kalman filter .",
    "a derivation of the kalman filter is briefly reviewed in this section .",
    "some equations and ideas presented in this section will be used to present our proposed modified kalman filter in the next section .",
    "derivations of the kalman filter can be found in many references @xcite .",
    "consider the model as given in ( [ eq_sec1_1 ] ) and ( [ eq_sec1_2 ] ) .",
    "the kalman filtering assumes that both the modeling error noise @xmath8 and the measurement disturbance @xmath9 are gaussian with the following covariance matrix , @xmath12=\\begin{cases } \\mathbf q_k , & \\text{for } \\quad i = k,\\\\0 , & \\text{for } \\quad i\\ne k.\\\\ \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath13=\\begin{cases } \\mathbf r_k , & \\text{for } \\quad i = k,\\\\0 , & \\text{for } \\quad i\\ne k.\\\\ \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let @xmath14 be the priori estimate , which is the estimate of @xmath3 given @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and let @xmath19 be the posterior estimate , which is the estimate of @xmath3 given @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath20 .",
    "it is known that @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 represents expectation and @xmath10 is from ( [ eq_sec1_1 ] ) .",
    "the kalman filter assumes that the posterior estimate is expressed as the prior estimate corrected by the measurement data , @xmath24 for some @xmath4-by-@xmath7 matrix @xmath25 ( so called kalman gain ) .",
    "note that @xmath11 is from ( [ eq_sec1_2 ] ) .",
    "the kalman gain @xmath25 is solved by minimizing @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "note that @xmath27 = \\text{tr } \\ { { \\mathbf p}_k\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 represents the trace operator , and the @xmath4-by-@xmath4 covariance matrix @xmath29 is defined as follows @xmath30.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] define @xmath31.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it follows from ( [ eq_sec2_1 ] ) , ( [ eq_sec2_2 ] ) , ( [ eq_sec2_6 ] ) and ( [ eq_sec2_7 ] ) that @xmath32 substituting ( [ eq_sec2_4 ] ) into ( [ eq_sec2_6 ] ) , we get @xmath33 it follows from ( [ eq_sec2_9 ] ) that @xmath34 solve @xmath25 by letting @xmath35 , we get @xmath36 by ( [ eq_sec2_9 ] ) and ( [ eq_sec2_11 ] ) , @xmath29 can be rewritten as @xmath37 combining ( [ eq_sec2_3 ] ) , ( [ eq_sec2_11 ] ) and ( [ eq_sec2_12 ] ) , we thus have the conventional kalman filter .",
    "this algorithm is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "it is known that the discrete time gaussian white noise can be approximated by the increments of brownian motion per time step , and the non - gaussian lvy noise can be approximated by the increments of the corresponding lvy process per time step . by lvy - ito theorem @xcite",
    ", a lvy process can be decomposed into the sum of a gaussian process and a pure jump process .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the small jumps of a lvy process can be approximated by a gaussian process .",
    "therefore , we can approximately regard a lvy process as combination of a gaussian process and a process with big jumps . for more information about decomposition of a lvy processes ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "these results enable us to decompose a non - gaussian lvy noise into a gaussian white noise plus some extremely large values .    in our proposed filtering method ,",
    "we convert the original lvy noise into a gaussian white noise by clipping off its extremely large values .",
    "let @xmath38 represent the clipped version of the lvy measurement disturbance @xmath9 , and let @xmath39 represent the corresponding clipped observation .",
    "thus @xmath40 in practice , since the measurement noise , @xmath9 , is unknown , we propose to clip the observation @xmath6 instead of @xmath9 in a component - wise way by the following operation : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is some positive threshold value , @xmath43 and @xmath44 represent the @xmath45-th components of the vectors @xmath6 and @xmath14 , respectively , and @xmath46 is the @xmath45-th component of the vector @xmath47 .",
    "note that @xmath42 is determined by the statistical properties of the measurement noise @xmath9 . replacing the observation value @xmath6 in ( [ eq_sec2_4 ] ) with its clipped value ,",
    "we get @xmath48 repeating the same procedure in section @xmath49 to solve the kalman gain @xmath25 by minimizing @xmath50 , we get @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the covariance matrix of @xmath38 defined as @xmath53 in the conventional kalman filter , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are assumed to be known , and as noted in @xcite , it is often a difficult task to estimate the covariance matrices @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "in the modified kalman filter here , we only assume @xmath54 is known and suggest @xmath52 be estimated as follows .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq_sec3_1 ] ) and ( [ eq_sec3_2 ] ) that @xmath56\\left[(\\tilde { \\mathbf z}_k - { \\mathbf h}_k \\bar { \\mathbf x}_k ) - { \\mathbf h}_k ( { \\mathbf x}_k -\\bar { \\mathbf x}_k ) \\right]^t\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\",
    "= & ( \\tilde { \\mathbf z}_k - { \\mathbf h}_k \\bar { \\mathbf x}_k ) ( \\tilde { \\mathbf z}_k - { \\mathbf h}_k \\bar { \\mathbf x}_k ) ^t + { \\mathbf h}_k \\bar { \\mathbf p}_k { \\mathbf h}_k^t.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in deriving the last identity of ( [ eq_sec3_6 ] ) , we have used the fact that @xmath39 and @xmath14 are known values and @xmath57 with ( [ eq_sec3_6 ] ) , ( [ eq_sec3_4 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath58 where @xmath59    combining equations ( [ eq_sec3_2 ] ) , ( [ eq_sec3_3 ] ) , ( [ eq_sec3_8 ] ) , and ( [ eq_sec3_9 ] ) , we obtain the modified kalman filter , as shown graphically in figure [ fig2 ] .    comparing with the conventional kalman filter ,",
    "the proposed filter has an moderately increased computational cost due to the following two operations : i ) the clipping operation for @xmath6 ; ii ) the computation of @xmath60 .",
    "the former operation is implemented by if - else sentence , and the latter is simply a vector - vector outer product .",
    "consider a particle moving in the plane at some velocity subject to random perturbations in its trajectory . the new position at time @xmath61 is equal to the old position at time @xmath62 plus the velocity and noise .",
    "the model can be expressed in form of ( [ eq_sec1_1 ] ) and ( [ eq_sec1_2 ] ) as @xmath63 and @xmath64 where ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) is the position at time @xmath62 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 the velocity , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 are all gaussian white noises with zero mean and unit variance , and @xmath73 and @xmath74 are independent and identically distributed noises consist of two components : i ) a symmetric @xmath75-stable lvy noises with the index of stability @xmath76 and the scale parameter @xmath77 ( see @xcite ) ; ii ) a gaussian white noise with variance of 5 . since the measurement noises , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , have infinite variances , the conventional kalman filter can not be applied to estimate the position @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "so we apply the modified kalman filter proposed in the previous section .",
    "take @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and we apply the modified kalman filtering method to estimate @xmath78 and @xmath79 . in the simulation , the initial a priori estimate of the state , ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) ,",
    "is set to be equal to the observation at time @xmath86 , its error covariance , @xmath87 , is set to be unit matrix , and the threshold value @xmath42 is set to be @xmath88 .",
    "the simulation results are shown in figure [ fig3 ] , where the estimate position error , @xmath89 , defined by @xmath90 is compared with the observed position error , @xmath91 , defined by @xmath92 the results in figure [ fig3 ] are calculated by averaging @xmath93 times of simulations .",
    "it is seen from this figure that the position estimation error is significantly improved by using our modified kalman filter .    in the simulation , we select @xmath42 by the method of trial and error , and it is found that the threshold value @xmath42 is not very picky and @xmath42 can vary from @xmath94 to @xmath95 without significant effects on the performance of the modified kalman filter . determining the optimal @xmath42 , which is crucial for the modified kalman filter , deserves further research and will be left for our future work",
