    "with the data from cern s lep electron - positron collider , desy s hera electron - proton collider and fermilab s tevatron proton - antiproton collider , the standard model ( sm ) has received overwhelming experimental support .",
    "no new physics has been observed essentially at mass below @xmath3 .",
    "thus , it is imperative that the fermilab tevatron , the world s highest energy particle collider , be used for searches of new phenomena .",
    "the cdf and dexperiments have been actively studying their data for evidence of previously unobserved particles .",
    "presented below are the latest results of searches at the tevatron for supersymmetric particles ( chargino , gluino ) , leptoquark bosons and heavy gauge bosons .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite is a _ supersymmetrized _ sm with two higgs doublets , which is one of the most appealing theories proposed to test grand unification @xcite .",
    "conservation of @xmath6-parity requires the susy particles to be produced in pairs and prevents decays of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lightest neutralino @xmath7 ) .",
    "the most distinctive signatures of chargino - neutralino ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) pair production are trilepton events @xcite and like - sign ( ls ) dileptons associated with large missing transverse energy ( @xmath10 plus multi - jets @xcite .",
    "pair - produced @xmath4 decay as @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the striking signature of these events is thus three isolated leptons plus @xmath13 .",
    "the cdf search is based on 100 data .",
    "most of the events are from inclusive @xmath14 and @xmath15 triggers at @xmath16 10 .",
    "the trilepton requirements are @xmath17 11 and @xmath18 5 ( 4 ) for @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , which is the same as in the previous analysis ( based on 19 ) @xcite .",
    "eight events are left which are consistent with the sm background .",
    "a further cut of @xmath19 15 gev is imposed to reduce the background .",
    "there is no trilepton event candidate found , which is consistent with an expected background of @xmath20 for four trilepton ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) modes .",
    "the d  trilepton analysis requires a lower cut of @xmath25 5 , although the events are from several trigger paths ( inclusive @xmath14 and @xmath15 samples and @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 dilepton samples ) .",
    "the acceptance difference due to those trigger thresholds are corrected using a monte carlo simulation .",
    "dalso observes no trilepton event candidate in 14 , which complies with an expected background of @xmath29 for @xmath21 , @xmath30 for @xmath22 , @xmath31 for @xmath23 , @xmath32 for @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "both cdf and dhave a similar constraint inspired by supergravity models @xcite . the cdf analysis @xcite calculates slepton ( @xmath33 ) and sneutrino ( @xmath34 ) masses from @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 using the renormalization group equations  @xcite , while d@xcite uses a minimal supergravity model in isajet @xcite . in those models , chargino and neutralino have three - body decays .",
    "the cdf analysis excludes @xmath38 66 ( 95% c.l . ) at @xmath35 = 2 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 gev ( the region of maximum experimental sensitivity ) .",
    "the cdf limit on @xmath41 ( 66 ) is comparable to the lep1.5 result  @xcite . the d  result is not sensitive to set any mass limits for the isajet model .",
    "limits on @xmath42(4 trilepton modes ) are also obtained : 0.6 pb ( cdf ) and 4 pb ( d ) for 70-chargino .",

    "@xmath43 , so that the trilepton signal is nearly maximized via @xmath44 66% ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) and @xmath45 = 100% .",
    "however , the mass difference of @xmath46 and @xmath7 decreases as @xmath47 increases , so that the total trilepton acceptance as a function of @xmath47 becomes flat at about 5% at 60 and falls off for @xmath48 75 .",
    "figure  [ upp_lim ] shows the 95% c.l .",

    "the points in the figure are the isajet predictions for @xmath50 production in the supergravity model .",
    "the limit on @xmath47 is 73 .",
    "the ls dilepton approach is complementary to the classic multi - jets+@xmath13 analysis in the search for @xmath51 , @xmath9 and @xmath52 production .",
    "the signature arises mainly from @xmath5 production followed by dominant decays of @xmath53 and @xmath54 if @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the final state contains two or more leptons ( from @xmath41 and @xmath56 decays ) , @xmath13 and jets . since the gluino is a majorana fermion ,",
    "there is no charge correlation between these leptons .",
    "such a data analysis begins with a dilepton sample ( @xmath57 12 ( 10 ) ) and subsequently requires @xmath58 25  gev and @xmath59 with @xmath60 15 gev in @xmath61 since the production cross section times branching ratio is small , cdf searched for the dilepton signature without the ls requirement . in 19 , one event ( @xmath62 ) is observed , which is consistent with an expected background of @xmath63 . the lower gluino mass at 95% c.l . is calculated to be 154 for @xmath64 and 224 for @xmath65 at @xmath66 and @xmath40 gev @xcite .",

    "cdf also searches for the third generation leptoquark ( @xmath77 ) in @xmath78 mode , where one of the @xmath79 leptons decays semileptonically and the second @xmath79 has 1 or 3-prong hadronic decays .",
    "the @xmath79-decay lepton ( @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) is required to have @xmath80 20 ( @xmath81 ) .",

    "the charge of the @xmath79 candidate is defined to be the total charge of 1 or 3 tracks and required to be an opposite sign to the lepton charge .",
    "this reduces the qcd background by a factor of @xmath852 .",
    "the azimuthal separation between the lepton and @xmath13 directions should be less than @xmath86 to reduce the @xmath87 + jets events .",
