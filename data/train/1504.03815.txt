    "confinement has a significant effect on fluids when the separation between the confining surfaces is comparable with the characteristic structural length of the confined fluid  @xcite . in simple fluids such pore thicknesses",
    "are of order of ngstrms .",
    "the effects of confinement depend on whether the boundaries are rigid or adaptive . in the latter case mechanical equilibrium between the stress in the solid walls resulting from the swelling or shrinking of the pore , and the solvation force  @xcite induced on the walls by the confined fluid",
    "can lead to contraction or expansion of the pore  @xcite .",
    "similar dependence on the type of confinement is expected in the case of self - assembling systems , but on different length and energy scales  @xcite .",
    "the packing effects of molecules are replaced in this case by the packing effects of micelles , clusters or layers that are much larger and softer . in this work",
    "we focus on colloidal self - assembly in thermodynamic conditions corresponding to self - assembly into clusters or layers in the bulk@xcite .",
    "we study rigid and elastic boundaries , and consider separations of the confining walls comparable with a few structural units .",
    "the adaptive confinement in this case means confining surfaces that are soft and separated by hundreds of nanometers .",
    "important examples of such a confinement exist in organella or in lipid or polymeric vesicles .",
    "one can expect that the shape of the outer membrane and the ordering inside the vesicle or organellum influence each other in a way that depends on the elasticity of the membrane .",
    "we shall consider self - assembly in systems with fixed boundaries and with boundaries with different elasticity , from stiff to very soft .",
    "some of the membranes are permeable , while some other are not .",
    "thus , a question arises if fluctuations of the number of confined particles have any effect on the properties of a self - assembling system confined by rigid or adaptive boundaries .",
    "this question motivates our present study .",
    "we ask how the effects of confinement on the self - assembling system depend on the contact with a reservoir of particles .",
    "the above problems are very difficult for realistic models of self - assembling systems confined by elastic boundaries . in order to gain some first insight ,",
    "however , one can consider simplified models . in this work we consider the simple generic model of the system with competing short - range attraction and longer - range repulsion ( salr ) that can be solved exactly @xcite .",
    "the model was solved exactly and systematically analyzed in the bulk @xcite and in confinement  @xcite in the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) .",
    "recently a procedure to extract full canonical information from grand - canonical results has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in principle , it is possible to apply this technique to our exact gce results .",
    "however , in the current problem the presence of energetic terms and low temperature pose numerical difficulties in the mapping procedure between the results in both ensembles . for this reason we decide to perform mc simulations in the canonical ensemble ( ce ) .",
    "in the case of fixed boundaries we address the question of how the fluctuations of the positions and sizes of the clusters ( their dynamical assembly and dissociation ) are coupled with the fluctuations of the number of particles in the system . in the case of inhomogeneous distribution of particles",
    "it is not a priori obvious that the largest fluctuations in the total number of particles lead to the largest differences between the density profiles in the canonical and grand canonical ensembles .",
    "we shall compare the density profiles and the pressure in the gce and ce ensembles , with the average number of particles in the gce equal to the number of particles @xmath0 in the ce .",
    "we shall pay particular attention to values of @xmath0 that are too small or too large for a given system size @xmath1 for formation of periodically distributed layers of particles that minimizes the system energy .",
    "roughly speaking , in the salr systems the minimum energy is assumed when the individual clusters have the lowest energy ( no intra - cluster repulsion ) , and are separated by the smallest distances corresponding to no inter - cluster repulsion . when the number of particles is too small or too large for a given @xmath1 for formation of the optimal bulk structure , some structural deformations must occur .",
    "our purpose is to compare these deformations and their effect on the mechanical properties in the gce and ce .",
    "adaptive boundaries were studied in ref . [ ] in the case of fixed number of discs surrounded by particles kept by laser tweezers .",
    "the system exhibited bistability ; either hexagonal structure ( and modified boundaries ) or concentric rings of particles occurred .",
    "we observed a different bistability in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we studied particles interacting with the salr potential and confined by boundaries , whose separation could be varied at the cost of elastic energy .",
    "when the average number of particles is too small or too large for given @xmath1 for formation of the optimal bulk structure , some compromise must occur between the excess of the free energy associated with the structural deformations , and the elastic energy cost due to adjusting the size of the compartment to the optimal structure of the confined fluid .",
    "we obtained exact results for a one dimensional ( 1d ) model in gce , and required mechanical equilibrium between the fluid - induced solvation force and the elastic force present when the system shrinks or expands .",
    "we found that when the equilibrium width of the empty container corresponded to the largest stress of the confined colloidal system , two significantly different system sizes were almost equally probable .",
    "the large size fluctuations are accompanied by absorption or evaporation of a whole cluster .",
    "clearly , for fixed number of particles such large size fluctuations are not possible .",
    "hence , the permeability plays an important role in the case of elastic boundaries . in this work",
    "we verify if in the case of fixed number of particles the bistability of the system size can still exist due to some other mechanism .",
    "we present the model and the simulation methods in sec .",
    "the density profiles are described and compared with the results obtained in the gce in sec .",
    "the mechanical properties are discussed in sec .",
    "we compare the dependence of pressure on density in the ce ( fixed @xmath2 and varying @xmath1 ) and in the gce for several fixed values of @xmath1 and varying @xmath3 .",

    "more detailed descriptions of the model and the transfer matrix method used for finding the exact solutions of the model in the gce can be found in @xcite .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattice model and assume an isotropic effective pair interaction potential of the salr type .",
    "the ranges of the competing attractive and repulsive parts are chosen such that small clusters are formed for some range of thermodynamic variables .",
    "namely , we assume that the nearest neighbors attract each other and the third neighbors repel each other , i.e. the effective pair interaction potential is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the energy of attraction , @xmath6 is the energy of repulsion and the unit distance is the particle diameter @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the distance between two sites of the lattice .",
    "such a shape of the effective potential can be found for charged particles in solvents that induce short range attraction between the particles , e.g. for lysozyme molecules in water @xcite or for colloids in a solvent containing short - chain polymers  @xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite we assumed periodic boundary conditions and extensively investigated the spontaneous pattern formation of particles in the bulk . in order to study the effects of confinement on the self - assembled structures , we changed the boundary conditions of the model from periodic to rigid or elastic in ref.@xcite . in the current study",

    "the difference between the two equilibrium widths of the system is equal to the period of the bulk structure in the case of permeable walls , and to half the period of the bulk structure when the number of particles is constrained . since in our 1d system",
    "the energy barrier is @xmath198 , spontaneous changes of the system size may be induced by thermal fluctuations .",
