    "<S> we have found that the minimum energy configuration of @xmath0 charges confined in a disk and interacting via the coulomb potential , reported by cerkaski et al . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is not a global minimum of the total electrostatic energy . </S>",
    "<S> we have identified a large number of configurations with lower energy , where defects are present close to the center of the disk ; thus , the formation of a hexagonal core and valence circular rings for the centered configurations , predicted by the model of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , is not supported by numerical evidence and the configurations obtained with this model can not be used as a guide for the numerical calculations , as claimed by the authors .    in a recent paper , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , cerkaski et al . studied the problem of a finite number of equal charges , interacting via the coulomb potential and confined inside a disk . </S>",
    "<S> this problem has been previously studied by several authors in a series of papers , refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and it can be regarded as a generalization of the well  known thomson problem @xcite ( finding the configurations of minimum energy of @xmath1 equal charges on the surface of a sphere ) . despite the apparent simplicity , both problems provide a serious computational challenge , of increasing difficulty with @xmath1 : in particular , the number of local minima of the total electrostatic energy grows very fast with @xmath1 ( for the case of the thomson problem see for example the discussion in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the identification of the global minimum of a system of @xmath1 charges typically requires extensive numerical calculations : in the absence of a formal criterium to establish whether a given configuration of equilibrium is a global minimum , one has to repeat the numerical calculations several times , keeping @xmath1 fixed , and regard the configuration with lowest energy among those obtained as a probable candidate for a global minimum .    for the case of the disk , erkoc and oymak @xcite </S>",
    "<S> have observed the tendency , for systems with modest number of charges ( @xmath2 ) , to accomodate the charges on concentric rings , empirically deducing the rules for the distribution of charges on the disk ( incidentally , most of the energies reported by these authors in tables @xcite do not correspond to global minima ) . the analysis performed by cerkaski et al . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is a refinement of the work of erkoc and oymak @xcite , and it relies on the hypothesis that charges arrange on concentric rings , for configurations of minimum energy . in this way , </S>",
    "<S> the original problem is reduced to the much simpler problem of calculating the electrostatic energy due to @xmath3 rings , each carrying an appropriate number of charges , uniformely distributed over the ring ; the equilibrium configuration in this case is obtained by solving a system of two equations ( their eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) ) .    to test their model </S>",
    "<S> the authors have performed numerical ( molecular dynamics , md for short ) calculations for systems up to @xmath4 charges . based on this analysis </S>",
    "<S> they conclude that their approach allows one `` to determine with high accuracy the equilibrium configurations of a few hundred charged particles '' . in particular , for @xmath5 their approach `` predicts the formation of the hexagonal core and valence circular rings for the centered configurations '' , with `` an increasing sequence of rings , starting from the center , matching the regular hexagonal pattern '' . for the case of @xmath0 , discussed at length in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the authors observe the formation of an hexagonal structure with rings @xmath6 . fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , that reports a comparison between the model and the numerical md calculations for @xmath0 charges , displays an excellent agreement between the two , with only a small mismatch just outside the hexagonal structure ( the green region in the figure is used to highlight the hexagonal structure ) . the energy reported by the authors for this configuration , which is expected to be </S>",
    "<S> a global minimum of the total energy , is @xmath7 , compared to the energy @xmath8 , obtained with their model , with an error of just @xmath9 .    with the purpose of veryfying the results of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we have carried out extensive numerical calculations , in particular for the case of @xmath10 charges . </S>",
    "<S> the approach that we have implemented allows one to generate configurations with the desired number of charges on the border : in this way we have verified that the lower energies occurr when @xmath11 charges are disposed on the border of the disk , in agreement with ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have thus generated @xmath12 configurations with @xmath11 , starting from initial configurations where the internal charges are randomly distributed , and we have found that @xmath13 of them have energy lower that the value reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest energy among those that we have calculated ( possibly a global minimum ) is @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the histogram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_1 ] illustrates these points . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we have also found that even the configuration with largest energy has an energy slightly lower that the value predicted by the model of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , @xmath16 ( see fig .  [ fig_1 ] ) .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_2 ] we display the configuration with the lowest energy among those calculated ( an hexagonal grid is also plotted , to facilitate the identification of a centered hexagonal structure ) ; note that the color of the vertices , representing the charges , depends on the number of nearest neighbors . studying this figure </S>",
    "<S> , we observe the presence of defects very close to the center of the disk , and of a single , slightly deformed , hexagonal cell ( the yellow region ) , centered at the origin , in sharp contrast with the numerical and theoretical observations of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we have also found that similar behaviors are also observed for the configurations with slightly larger energy .    </S>",
    "<S> we summarize our main findings :    * the occurrence of defects , even very close to the center of the disk , may help to lower the total energy , while disrupting the hexagonal structure ; * all the configurations with @xmath11 that we have calculated have energy lower than the theoretical value obtained in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and about @xmath17 of them has energy lower than the numerical md value of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ; * the use of the model of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite as a guide for the numerical md calculation ( which is also claimed to cut the cpu times by a factor @xmath18 ) , as suggested by the authors , is definitively unjustified . using this approach </S>",
    "<S> , we may expect that the solutions not only will correspond to local minima of the energy , but they will also be strongly biased ( i.e. the more symmetric structures could be favored ) ; * the number of configurations grows very fast with @xmath1 , thus requiring an efficient numerical approach : our program allows to generate configurations with a desired number of charges on the border . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that in this way the performance is drastically improved ;    in light of this findings , the validity of the model of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite must be questioned , particularly for @xmath5 ; it also appear clear the inadeguacy of the numerical calculation of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which has failed to identify a very large number of configurations with energy lower than the one reported by the authors ( about @xmath17 of the configurations that we have calculated have lower energy than the one of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ! ) . </S>",
    "<S> we are not sure whether this problem has been triggered by using the output of the model as a guide for the numerical calculation or if the program used by the authors produced a small number of configurations with @xmath11 .     </S>",
