    "therefore , so is the time elapsed between two orbit resets that lead to cd segments .",
    "hence , in a finite time , there can only be finitely many orbit resets that lead to a cd segment .",
    "putting the two cases together , one concludes that in a finite time there can only be finitely many orbit resets.@xmath63 + we conclude that the addition of postulate [ orbitresets ] to the mathematical model ensures forward existence and uniqueness of solutions for all time .    note that , however , backwards uniqueness is broken by orbit resets , since when an orbit undergoes a reset it joins a regular orbit of the system .",
    "in fact , orbit resets are the only way in which backwards uniqueness is broken in the system .",
    "in this second part of the paper we analyze the dynamics of the system . rather than providing a long and exhaustive characterization , we highlight some of the more interesting features of the system . however , for completeness , we first state a general theorem concerning the forward limit set of the system .",
    "the forward limit set of the system is the set of orbits that are governed exclusively by coupled oscillator dynamics and contact dynamics , in other words , the set of orbits that do not go through any rebound .    since the theorem is quite plausible and the proof is long , we ommit the proof .",
    "it relies on a lasalle standard type of argument .",
    "we just point out that , to use such an argument , invariance of the forward limit set must first be proved .",
    "note that this is not immediate , because for a discontinuous system the forward limit set is not necessarily invariant , as the example below illustrates .    a discontinuous dynamical system with a non - invariant forward limit set .",
    "@xmath198 , where @xmath199 + clearly , the only point in the forward limit set of this system is the point @xmath200 .",
    "however , the forward limit set is not invariant since @xmath200 is not a fixed point of the dynamics . @xmath63 +      in this section we study orbits which contain both cd segments and cod segments but no rebounds , that is , orbits where mass one alternates finite periods against the stop with periods in which it oscillates together with mass two under coupled oscillator dynamics . since mass one must avoid any rebounds , such orbits might seem unlikely",
    ". however they do exist .",
    "it turns out that all such orbits are periodic and consist of exactly two and only two segments , one governed by the contact dynamics , the other by the coupled oscillator dynamics .",
    "we call them 2-phase periodic hybrid orbits .",
    "we start by showing why these 2-phase periodic hybrid orbits are the only possible orbits made of just cd and cod segments .",
    "+ let us track such an hypothetical hybrid orbit , starting with a cd segment .",
    "first note that , following a cd segment , a cod segment can only be joined at a point in the set @xmath201 .",
    "this is so , since these are the exiting points of the cd region ( see chart  [ bigchart ] ) .",
    "let the cod segment be joined at the point @xmath202 , where @xmath169 is a negative number .",
    "now , this point , when evolved under cod in backwards time , comes from the @xmath203 region .",
    "this means that , whether the cod orbit is periodic or quasiperiodic , if the system stays long enough under coupled oscillator dynamics , the orbit will return to the @xmath203 region .",
    "but we know this can never happen , so eventually a rebound or a cd segment must follow that cod segment .",
    "assume a cd segment rather than a rebound follows the cod segment .",
    "this next cd segment can be joined only at a point on the entrance surface of the cd region / exit surface of the cod region . from chart  [ bigchart ] , this must be a point of the form @xmath204 , where @xmath205 is a positive number .",
    "furthermore , because energy was conserved during the preceeding cod segment , we must have that @xmath206 .",
    "next , during the cd segment mass two oscillates as a harmonic oscillator for a fraction of a complete cycle .",
    "if the cd segment started at @xmath207 , it must end at @xmath202 ( see figure [ hypersurface ] ) . at this instant",
    "the orbit as exactly the same initial conditions as at the beginning of the description . therefore everything simply repeats . we conclude that + _ the periodic orbits described above are the only possible orbits that contain both coupled oscillator dynamics and contact dynamics and no rebounds at all .",
    "conservation of energy precludes the possibility of more complicated orbits , periodic or otherwise . _",
    "+ we now turn to the task of explicitly constructing 2-phase periodic hybrid solutions analytically .",

    "the tori to the right of the line are cut by the stop , while the ones to the left of the line are the interior tori .",
    "+    an orbit that starts in a torus that is cut by the stop winds around that torus until it intersects the surface where the torus is cut . at that point , physically ,",
    "a rebound occurs . in the action space ,",

    "it then starts winding around the new torus until it again reaches the surface where the torus is cut , at which point the orbit jumps again to a torus of lower energy .",
    "the jumps are never to one of the interior tori since interior tori form an invariant set . also , because of quasiperiodicity , an orbit in a torus which is cut by the stop can not remain under cod indefinitely without intersecting the @xmath38 surface .",

    "this can be seen in figure [ zoom ] , a zoom of figure [ figurex00 ] near the grazing tori line .",

    "left picture , a different initial condition , @xmath265 , was used . on the top right picture the coefficient of friction was reduced to @xmath266 .",
    "hence , more energy is lost at each impact and within a small number of impacts the system comes very close to a grazing torus . on the bottom left picture ,",

    "we point out that this section s analysis is not pertinent when the cod orbits are periodic rather than quasiperiodic . in that case , there exist cod orbits that never intersect the @xmath38 surface even though they live in tori that are cut by the stop .",

    "we started by showing that applying the standard model in which the system switches between the different types of governing dynamics results in a fundamental problem , namely the existence of a nonzero measure set in the phase space where infinite rebounds occur in a finite time .",
    "this problem was solved by continuing such orbits from the limit point approached by the infinite rebounds .",
    "then , looking at the system dynamics , we found a particularly interesting type of periodic behavior , the 2-phase periodic hybrid orbits , which we described analytically .",
