    "the power density spectra of low mass x - ray binaries show broad band noise components , produced by aperiodic variability , the sum of which typically rises towards lower frequencies ( sometimes flattening below a frequency @xmath1 ) and is often termed red noise .",
    "other power spectrum features are often present , including relatively broad peaks , quasi periodic oscillations , bumps , wiggles and low frequencies excesses ( see _ e.g. _ wijnands & van der klis 1999 for a review ) . in many respects these noise components are similar to those observed in high mass x - ray binaries , containing x - ray pulsators and black hole candidates ( see _ e.g. _ belloni & hasinger 1990 ) .",
    "the continuum component of the red noise is usually modeled by broken power laws and/or lorentzians .    in power spectra of x - ray pulsators",
    "a number of harmonic lines arising from the modulation of the flux due to the neutron star spin is also present . in this case ,",
    "information on the regions giving rise to the aperiodic variability can be extracted from the study of the power spectra ( burderi _ et al .",
    "_ , 1997 , hereafter b97 ; lazzati and stella , 1997 , hereafter ls97 ) . indeed ,",
    "if all or part of the aperiodic variability is produced by matter funneled by the magnetic field lines and accreting onto the magnetic polar caps of the neutron star , a modulation of that part of the aperiodic signal at the spin period would be expected ( harmonic coupling ) . in the power spectra",
    "this would appear as a broadening of the wings of the harmonic lines due the convolution of each harmonic line with the red noise ( burderi , robba & cusumano 1993 ) that produces a rescaled version of the red noise placed at both sides of each harmonic peak .",
    "alternatively , if none of the aperiodic variability is generated in the funneled matter , the periodic and red noise features are expected to be independent of each other and there should be no broadening at the base of the harmonic lines .",
    "a significant broadening in the wings of the harmonic lines was detected in the power spectra of some x - ray pulsators ( b97 ; ls97 ) , indicating that aperiodic variability is modulated at the spin period of the neutron star , _",
    "i.e. _ produced at the neutron star magnetic polar caps .",
    "more recently , a coupling between the period and aperiodic variability of hercules x-1 has been reported ( moon & eikenberry 2001 ) .    in 1998",
    "the first millisecond accretion powered x - ray pulsar was discovered with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) by wijnands & van der klis ( 1998a ) .",
    "the pulsation frequency was @xmath2 hz and showed a periodic modulation at @xmath3 hours testifying to the presence of a low mass companion orbiting the neutron star with a mass function of the secondary star of @xmath4 ( chakrabarty & morgan 1998 ) .",
    "the source was identified with sax j1808.4 - 3658 , a transient first detected with beppo sax in 1996 which displayed type i x - ray bursts and was classified as a low mass x - ray binary at an estimated distance of 4 kpc ( in t zand et al .",
    "this distance has been recently updated to 2.5 kpc ( in t zand et al .",
    "the coherent pulsation was detected during the 1998 outburst when the source was repeatedly observed with rxte from the @xmath5 of april to the @xmath6 of may .",
    "the source reached a peak luminosity of @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 on the @xmath9 of april and then faded gradually below @xmath10 erg s@xmath8 by the @xmath6 of may . throughout this period the x - ray spectrum remained stable , featuring a power law shape with a photon index @xmath11 in the 15 - 100 kev band and a high energy cut - off above about 100 kev , similar to the x - ray spectra of other type i bursters in their low state ( gilfanov et al .",
    "1998 ; heindl & smith 1998 ) .",
    "wijnands & van der klis ( 1998b ) studied the rapid aperiodic variability and revealed the presence of a red noise component in the power spectra flattening below a knee frequecy @xmath12 hz . the periodic modulation was nearly sinusoidal in shape and the power spectra displayed a very pronounced coherent peak at @xmath13 hz .",
    "the possibility of detecting a modulation at the spin frequency in the aperiodic variability depends crucially on the spin frequency : if this is too low , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath14 the broadening of the harmonic line s wings is so wide that it blends in the red noise itself ( b97 ; ls97 ) .",
    "however , for sax j1808.4 - 3658 @xmath15 , which means that the typical duration of the aperiodic variations is many spin cycles , making this source a particularly well suited candidate to search for the presence of a coupling between this red noise component and the periodic variability .",
    "analytic derivations of the power spectrum of a signal consisting of aperiodic variability , a periodic modulation and a coupling of the two was described by b97 and ls97 .",
    "our aim is to use an analytic function to fit the power spectrum of the sax j1808.4 - 3658 to derive the entity ( if present ) of the coupling . in line with b97",
    ", we adopt randomly occurring shots as a convenient description of the aperiodic variability giving rise to the red noise ( shot noise model ) . in this model",
    "the aperiodic variability is produced by a random superposition ( in the light curve ) of shots .",
    "these instabilities might originate in the accretion flow onto the compact object .",
    "we note that we can apply this model without loss of generality , as the coupling effect is independent of the mathematical model adopted to describe the red noise . in the following",
    "we briefly summarize some useful definitions and results from b97 .",
    "our shot noise process @xmath16 is obtained from the random superposition of identical shots occurring at a constant mean rate @xmath17 : the shot magnitude is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the intensity profile of a shot .",
    "this means that the average intensity of the shot component is @xmath20 .",
    "we indicate the power spectrum of the individual shot as @xmath21 .    a signal @xmath22 , as seen by a distant observer , emitted by a rotating neutron star of spin period @xmath23 is , in general , composed by : + a ) a ( constant ) background component @xmath24 ; + b ) an emission ( diffuse ) arising from matter not funneled on the neutron star magnetic caps @xmath25 and therefore not affected by the periodic modulation induced by the neutron star rotation ; + c ) a modulated ( localized ) component arising from matter accreting onto the magnetic poles @xmath26 .",
    "the periodic modulation function @xmath27 , representing the geometric lighthouse effect produced by the neutron star rotation , is a series of identical pulse profiles of period @xmath28 .",
    "expanded in fourier series @xmath29 . in the case of sax j1808.4 - 3658",
    "the pulse profile is almost sinusoidal and we can approximate @xmath30 .",
    "we require @xmath31 , this poses a constraint on @xmath32 and @xmath33 , namely , @xmath34 .",
    "thus we have @xmath35 let us assume that the diffuse and localized emission are each composed of a shot noise component and a constant component : we assume that the shot magnitude @xmath36 and profile @xmath19 is the same for both the shots arising in the localized and in the diffuse regions , while the shot rates are respectively @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 are respectively the constant emission of the diffuse and localized components of the signal .",
    "thus we have : @xmath41 @xmath42 and for the mean total intensity : @xmath43    the power spectra of the signal described above , taking into account the finite duration @xmath44 of the light curves and adopting the normalization of leahy ( 1983 ) is : @xmath45 the first term is the power at zero frequency and is only dependent on the total intensity of the signal .",
    "@xmath46 where @xmath47 is the normalization constant according to leahy and where @xmath48 is the window function .",
    "we note that @xmath49 where the fourier frequencies are computed at @xmath50 .",
    "for this reason @xmath51 has not been included in the fit discussed in ",
    "[ sec : fit ] . the red noise ( rn )",
    "term is @xmath52 where , in the simplest case of a shot noise process obtained from the random superposition of identical shots , @xmath53 , in a more general case @xmath54 is a non negative function normalized to @xmath55 that describes the shape of the red noise .",
    "the harmonic line term is given by : @xmath56 where , because of the almost sinusoidal shape of the sax j1808.4 - 3658 pulse profile , we have taken into account only the fundamental frequence .",
    "the coupling term is : @xmath57 it consists in a rescaled versions of the red noise placed at the harmonic frequencies , the scaling factor is @xmath58 .",
    "the white noise component @xmath59 , induced by counting statistics , has , adopting the normalization of leahy , an expected value of @xmath60 .",
    "the actual value is usually ( slightly ) less than @xmath60 because of detector dead - time effects ( _ e .",
    "g. _ van der klis 1989 ) , thus its value will be determined by the fit of the power spectra , as described in ",
    "[ sec : fit ] .",
    "we define the coupling fraction @xmath61 as the ratio of the arrival rates of the localized shots over the total shot rate .",
    "furthermore we define the pulsed fraction @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are respectively the maximum and the minumum of the modulating function over one period .",
    "with these definitions @xmath65 and we have @xmath66 .",
    "moreover , as @xmath67 always , we have @xmath68 and @xmath69 . therefore the following relation must hold : @xmath70^{-1/2 } + 2 \\sqrt{r } } \\le { \\cal p_{\\it f } } \\le { 4 \\sqrt{r }   \\over \\left [ 1 + 4\\left ( { 1 - \\eta \\over \\eta } \\right ) \\right]^{-1/2 } + 2 \\sqrt{r } } \\label{eq : pf}\\ ] ] in the following section we will determine @xmath71 from the fit of the power spectra and with relation ( [ eq : pf ] ) we will constrain the values of the pulsed fraction in relation to the fraction of coupled shots",
    ".    moreover we will be able to derive a relation between the diffuse component of the signal , as defined above , and the pulsed fraction .",
    "averaging the signal only over the shot noise process we define : @xmath72 thus @xmath73 @xmath74 we can therefore define the `` observed '' pulsed fraction @xmath75 with a little algebra we can derive @xmath76 = @xmath77 . recollecting that @xmath78 we can derive @xmath79 .",
    "we can now define the diffuse fraction as the ratio of the diffuse component over the sum of the diffuse and localized components as @xmath80 . using the relations",
    "above we have @xmath81 .",
    "we will see in the next section how the constraints on the pulsed fraction will have a bearing also on the fraction of the diffuse component .",
    "we used the observations of sax j1808.4 - 3658 performed by the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) during the april - may 1998 outburst ( see table 1 ) .",
    "in particular we examined the data from the proportional counter array ( pca ) ( jahoda et al .",
    "1996 ) which is composed of a set of five xenon proportional counters sensitive to x - rays in the 2 - 60 kev range with a total area of @xmath82 and a @xmath83 fwhm field of view .",
    "we used data collected with @xmath84 time resolution and 64 pha channels which were available for all observations ( except for the april 13 observation which was excluded from our analysis ) .",
    "we first corrected photons arrival times for satellite motion with respect to the solar system barycenter using the bepposax position for the source ( in t zand et al .",
    "1998 ) @xmath85 , @xmath86 @xmath87 .",
    "we then corrected for the orbital motion of the neutron star by using the orbital parameters derived by chakrabarty & morgan ( 1998 ) . for our analysis",
    "we rebinned the data into bins of @xmath88 ( corresponding to a nyquist frequency of @xmath89 hz ) and we used the events from all 64 pha channels .",
    "the resulting lightcurves were used for the subsequent analysis .    for each observation , we calculated consecutive ffts over time intervals of @xmath90 corresponding to power spectra with a frequency range of 0.015625 - 1024 hz .",
    "these power spectra were then averaged to produce a single power spectra for each observation , 16 in all .",
    "the source flux decreased across the observations by a factor of @xmath91 ( gilfanov et al .",
    "the aperiodic variability was determined to change with flux level ( wijnands & van der klis , 1998b ) .",
    "on the other hand , the simple model of the aperiodic variability described in the previous section assumes that the characteristics of the signal do not vary with time .",
    "thus in our analysis we selected and analyzed only the observations in which the source count rate was highest ( between @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) .",
    "in particular we selected the 6 consecutive observations between april 11 and 20 .",
    "examining the power spectra of each observation we consistently find an almost constant value for the red noise intensity and shape .",
    "the shape of the red noise in sax j1808.4 - 3658 was found to be reasonably well described by the sum of three empirical functions : @xmath94 where : @xmath95^{-1 } $ ] and @xmath96 indicates the normalization of each of them .    in order to fit the spectrum efficiently , we logarithmically rebinned the spectrum so that the number @xmath97 of original bins averaged in the @xmath98 new bin follows @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the integer part of @xmath101 .",
    "the region around the coherent modulation peak ( @xmath102 ) was left at the original fourier resolution , while the intervals @xmath103 and @xmath104 , in which the peak broadening would be more important , were ( uniformly ) rebinned by a factor of @xmath105 ( see fig .",
    "the region around the second harmonic of the modulation was excluded ( see above ) .",
    "we used a fitting function : @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 as defined above .",
    "thus @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "in order to check the robusteness of our fit we compared different fitting procedures .",
    "a ) in the first place we have tried a global fit , that is we simultaneously fit the whole range leaving all the parameters of the fit free to vary . then",
    ", keeping fixed the parameters that describe the three empirical functions @xmath113 , namely @xmath96 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , we compare the fit on the whole range leaving @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 free and leaving just @xmath116 and @xmath117 free and forcing @xmath119 , that is imposing the hypothesis of null coupling .",
    "we obtain two values of the @xmath120 with @xmath121 .",
    "b ) in second instance we repeated the procedure we compare the fit before and after freezing @xmath119 only in the region near the armonic line , beetween @xmath122 and @xmath123 hz , the difference in the @xmath120 we obtain is @xmath124 .",
    "c ) last we wanted to check if the effect was still present freezing also @xmath117 , measuring the height of the harmonic line , thus we compared the fit in the same region of case b ) and found that the @xmath125 .",
    "we thus conclude that the region that affects the fit is only the narrow region around @xmath0 hz and a significant coupling is present independently of the detailed fitting procedure .",
    "the values determined for case b ) of the @xmath113 and @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 parameters are listed in tab . 2 along with their errors . from the best fit parameters @xmath118 and @xmath116 we derive @xmath126 .",
    "an f  test calculates the probability that the @xmath127 variation is due to a chance improvement @xmath128 .    with the derived value of @xmath71 , we plot in figure ( [ fig : pf ] ) the two constraints defined by equation ( [ eq : pf ] ) in the @xmath129 ",
    "@xmath130 plane .",
    "the area between the curves defines the allowed region for the parameters .",
    "it can be seen that for any allowed value of the pulsed fraction a fraction of shots between @xmath131 must be modulated at the spin period ( coupled ) .",
    "moreover , even in the most favourable case of @xmath132 localized shots , the modulation has to be @xmath133 in order to account for the broadening detected .",
    "it can be noted that , in our discussion , we have assumed an identical amplitude for the localized and diffuse shots , that is , we have assumed that the blobs originating in the disk survive intact to the polar caps . it might be argued that the magnetic field just scoops off a fraction of each blob .",
    "we examined , for example , a case in which just @xmath134 of each blob is threaded to the neutron star surface . in this scenario",
    "we obtain that nothing much changes in the favourable case of total coupling ( @xmath132 ) , whilst for the maximum value of the pulsed fraction ( @xmath132 ) , a minimum fraction of shots greater than @xmath135 must be modulated at the spin period .",
    "that is , if just a part of each blob is scooped off , then more blobs must be funneled to observe the same effect .",
    "a different constraint can be derived comparing the `` observed '' pulsed fraction value @xmath136 with its theoretical value @xmath137 as derived from eq .",
    "6 above . to compute the value of",
    "the `` observed '' pulsed fraction we have folded the data corrected for the orbital motion modulo the spin period and obtained a pulse profile . adopting the background value for this observation of @xmath138 c / s ( wijnands & van der klis 1998a ) we found @xmath139 .",
    "we can note from fig .",
    "( 2 ) that the pulsed fraction @xmath140 and , recollecting the definition of the fraction of diffuse component @xmath141 we can pose a constraint on @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and so @xmath144 . we can now plot in fig ( 3 ) the diffuse fraction @xmath142 , versus the fraction of coupled shots @xmath129 .",
    "we have shown the presence of a broadening at the base of the harmonic line .",
    "this can be interpreted as the result of a coupling between a fraction ( between @xmath145 and @xmath132 ) of the aperiodic and periodic variability in sax j1808.4 - 3658 .",
    "moreover we have demonstrated that a fraction between @xmath146 and @xmath147 of the total emission arises from a component that is not modulated by the lighthouse effect ( diffuse component ) .",
    "some more stringent constraints can be derived if we assume that the diffuse component originates from an accretion disk and the localized component derives from accretion onto the neutron star surface . as the spin period of sax j1808.4 - 3658 is known , we can compute the corotation radius for this system _ i.e. _ the radius at which the speed of a particle rigidly rotating with the neutron star equals the local keplerian value , @xmath148 cm , where @xmath149 is the ns mass in units of solar masses and @xmath150 is the ns spin in milliseconds . in our case",
    "we get @xmath151 km assuming a mass of @xmath152 . for the accretion",
    "not to be centrifugally inhibited the inner rim of the disc must be located inside the corotation radius .",
    "therefore we have @xmath153 . in the standard scenario of disk accretion onto magnetized neutron stars ,",
    "the accreting matter forms a disk whose inner radius is truncated at the magnetosphere by the interaction of the accretion flow with the magnetic field of the ns . in this case",

    "we have @xmath174 .",
    "since the accretion disc is virialized , its luminosity ( averaged over the shot process ) is @xmath175 .",
    "the total luminosity is @xmath176 .",
    "therefore we have @xmath177 . a lower limit for the inner rim of the accretion disk is @xmath178 and therefore we get the constraint @xmath179 .",
    "this constraint is indicated as a dashed horizontal line in fig .",
    "this immediately gives a lower limit on the fraction of coupled shots @xmath180 indicated ad the dashed vertical line in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "this in turn limits the value of the pulsed fraction below @xmath181 as indicated in fig . 2 by the dashed horizontal line .",
    "an upper limit can be derived from the constraint derived in the previous paragraph @xmath182 that gives @xmath183 .",

    "<S> we conclude that the flux modulated by the spin period shows aperiodic variability similar to the red noise in the overall flux , suggesting such variability also originates at the magnetic caps close to the neutron star surface . </S>",
