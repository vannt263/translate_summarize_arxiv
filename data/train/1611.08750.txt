    "epidemic spreading @xcite is among the most studied processes in networks having applications spanning different disciplines from healthcare , to social sciences and finance .",
    "recently epidemic spreading and diffusion on multilayer networks @xcite are attracting increasing interest .",
    "in fact multilayer networks are ubiquitous and play a very important role in most spreading processes .",
    "for instance multilayer network include transportation networks @xcite along which viruses spread , social online networks responsible for the spread of rumors and behaviour @xcite , and financial networks and infrastructures where cascading failures can occur @xcite .",
    "multilayer networks @xcite are formed by several interacting networks ( called also layers ) .",
    "they can be classified in two main classes : multiplex networks and general multilayer networks .",
    "a multilayer network is a multiplex when all the nodes of any layer are mapped one - to - one to all the nodes of any other layer .",
    "additionally the links across layers only exist between corresponding nodes .",
    "a general multilayer network instead is formed by different networks including intralinks ( links within each layer ) and interlink ( links among different layers ) , with no restrictions on where the interlinks can be placed .",
    "so far several works have studied the susceptible - infected - suceptible ( sis ) @xcite and the susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) dynamics @xcite on multilayer networks .",
    "the sis model has been studied in multiplex and multilayer networks showing that the sis epidemics can become endemic in a multilayer network also if the single layers that form the structure could not possibly sustain the epidemics in isolation @xcite .",
    "interestingly in @xcite an analytic expression of the sis epidemic threshold has been derived in the framework of the annealed network approximation .",
    "the effect that social online networks can have in the actual spreading of a viral epidemic can be actually significant .",
    "this effect can be fully accounted @xcite by a multilayer network perspective by coupling two set of sis - like epidemics ( awareness - unawareness - awareness spreading in the social online network and susceptible - infected - susceptible spreading in the social contact network ) .",
    "it is notable that the multilayer network framework has been also successfully used to characterize the sis dynamics and predict the epidemic threshold on temporal networks @xcite .",
    "the sir model has been investigated extensively on multiplex networks @xcite using the mapping to bond percolation @xcite . the epidemic threshold has been predicted and the effect of different immunization strategies investigated .",
    "nevertheless , until now we do not have a comprehensive framework to study sir dynamics in a general multilayer network where there is an arbitrary number of links across the different layers .    here",
    "we provide exact results for the size of the epidemic outbreak and the epidemic threshold extending the mapping valid for the sir dynamics on single and multiplex network to general multilayer networks .",
    "we provide an exact solution of the bond percolation problem .",
    "although percolation is widely investigated in multiplex networks @xcite and general multilayer networks @xcite , most of the attention has been focusing until now on percolation of interdependent networks while only few works characterize bond percolation @xcite .",
    "here we are providing general results on bond percolation of multilayer networks which go beyond the existing literature on the subject finding closed analytical expressions for determining the percolation threshold .",
    "we are able to identify the key role of correlations in determining the percolation phase diagram of multilayer networks providing closed analytical expressions .",
    "finally we are able to use these results to predict the sir epidemic threshold and the average size of the epidemic outbreak .",
    "we consider the sir epidemic spreading model @xcite in which nodes can be in three possible states : susceptible , infected or recovered .",
    "susceptible nodes can be infected if a neighbouring node is infected .",
    "infected nodes can spread the epidemic to neighbouring susceptible nodes with a probability that depends on the infection rate .",
    "recovered nodes are nodes that have been infected in the past and are effectively removed from the population , i.e. they can not be infected but they can not spread the epidemics either .",
    "the sir model is characterized by a non - equilibrium phase transition occurring as a function of the infection rate . below the phase transition",
    "an epidemics started from a single infected individual remains localized and dies out after infecting an infinitesimal fraction of nodes . above the phase transition instead an epidemic outbreak",
    "is observed and the epidemics affects a finite fraction of all the nodes of the network . on single networks",
    "the sir dynamics is known to allow an exact solution thanks to the mapping of the model to bond percolation @xcite . in multilayer network",
    "the sir dynamics has been explored using the mapping to bond percolation in the case of multiplex networks @xcite . here",
    "we provide an exact solution of the sir dynamics on multilayer networks with arbitrary number of links across the layers .",
    "we consider a multilayer network @xmath0 with @xmath1 layers @xmath2 .",
    "each layer @xmath3 is formed by @xmath4 nodes indicated as @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "the connections of the multilayer network are fully determined by the @xmath7 supra - adjacency matrix @xmath8 of elements a_i , j=\\ {    ll1 & ( i , ) ( j , ) + 0 &    .",
    "every node @xmath5 has a multilayer degree _",
    "i=(k_i^[,1],k_i^[,2 ] ,  , k_i^[,m])where @xmath9}_{i\\alpha}$ ] indicates the number of nodes in layer @xmath10 that are connected to the node @xmath5 , i.e. k_i^[,]=_j=1^n a_i , j .",
    "the sir model over such multilayer network should describe an epidemics that spreads with different infection rates within and across the layers . to this end",
    "we indicate by @xmath11}$ ] the infection rate from a node in layer @xmath3 to a node in layer @xmath10 and we assume for simplicity that the infection rate across a single link does not depends on the direction in which the epidemic spread , i.e. @xmath11}=\\eta^{[\\beta,\\alpha]}$ ] .",
    "we indicate by @xmath12 the rate a which an infected node recovers . with this notation ,",
    "we can derive , following similar steps used for the sir dynamics on single layers @xcite the value of the transmissibility @xmath13}$ ] of the infection across a link going from a node in layer @xmath3 to a node in layer @xmath10 .",
    "this is equal to the probability that an infected node in layer @xmath3 , neighbour of a susceptible node in layer @xmath10 , actually transmits the epidemic to that node . since every infected individual recover at constant rate @xmath12 , the distribution @xmath14 of the lifetime @xmath15 of an infected node is poisson p()=e^- .",

    "having calculated the value of the transmissibility @xmath13}$ ] within and across the layers , we can use the well known result that maps the sir dynamics to bond percolation in a single network @xcite and extend it directly to a generic multilayer network .",
    "therefore the sir dynamics on a generic multilayer network maps to bond percolation where the probability @xmath18 to retain a link going from a node in layer @xmath3 to a node in layer @xmath10 is given by p_=t^[,]=. [ persir ] note that since we have assumed that the infection rate is symmetric @xmath11}=\\eta^{[\\beta,\\alpha]}$ ] we have also @xmath19 . in this mapping",
    "the percolation cluster represent the set of recovered nodes at the end of the epidemics outbreak",
    ". therefore the size of the giant component indicates the size of the outbreak .",
    "consequently the epidemic threshold corresponds to the epidemic threshold of the bond percolation problem .    in this way",
    "the study of sir model on multilayer networks is fully reduced to bond percolation on the same network structure .",
    "bond percolation on multilayer networks is an interesting critical phenomenon in itself characterizing the robustness of the network to random damage .",
    "here we show that bond percolation in multilayer networks with arbitrary number of links across the layers , can be exactly solved as long as the multilayer network is locally tree - like .",
    "this solution will reveal the important effects of correlations in the properties of epidemic spreading in multilayer networks .",
    "given a locally tree - like multilayer network of @xmath1 layers where links between nodes of layer @xmath3 and layer @xmath10 are retained with probability @xmath18 , it is possible to derive the expression of the average size of the giant component using a message passing algorithm .",
    "this approach is a straightforward generalization of the message passing algorithm use to detect the giant component in single networks @xcite .",
    "in fact , the only difference is that the probability to retain a link is now dependent on the classification of nodes in different layers . in this algorithm",
    "the probability @xmath20 that node @xmath5 is in the giant component depends on a set of messages exchanged between neighbouring nodes whose values are determined by a self - consistent set of equations .",
    "let us indicate with @xmath21 the generic message sent from a node @xmath5 to a neighbouring node @xmath22 and representing the probability that node @xmath5 connects node @xmath22 to the giant component whereas the link between node @xmath5 and node @xmath22 has not been removed .",
