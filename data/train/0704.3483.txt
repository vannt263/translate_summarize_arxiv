    "in recent years many theoretical and experimental studies involving dilute mixture of trapped ultra cold gases of bosonic and fermionic atoms have been reported in the literature .",
    "these mixtures provide a convenient way to achieve degenerate fermionic gas by means of sympathetic cooling as the conventional evaporative cooling methods used to obtain bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) are not applicable to fermions . besides this bose - fermi mixtures can be used to study many aspects of quantum statistics .",
    "experimentally , stable bec immersed in a degenerate fermi gas have been realized with @xmath0 in @xmath1 @xcite , @xmath2 in @xmath1 @xcite , and @xmath3 in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the first two bose - fermi mixtures are characterized by positive inter - species scattering lengths or repulsive interaction between bosons and fermions . on the other hand ,",
    "mixture of @xmath3 and @xmath4 give rise to large attractive boson - fermion interaction .",
    "recently , by exploiting fesbach resonance the inter - species interaction has been tuned with a large range positive and negative values .",
    "theoretically , the trapped system of bose - fermi mixture have been studied within the mean - field approximation to determine the bosons and fermion density profiles at zero temperature .",
    "these studies mainly focused on the phenomena of phase separation for repulsive and collapse mixture for attractive boson - fermion interaction respectively have been studied extensively @xcite . beside ground state density profiles",
    "the dynamic properties of bose - fermi mixture like free expansion @xcite and the spectrum of collective excitations @xcite have also been studied .",
    "all these studies have clearly showed that the spectra of collective excitations bear unambiguous signatures of phase transitions that bose - fermi mixtures undergo under appropriate conditions . moreover , for bec it is well established that the frequencies of collective oscillations can be measured with very high precision .",
    "consequently , it is natural to expect that by measuring the frequencies of the collective oscillations of a trapped bose - fermi mixture it would be possible to determine the parameters at which mixture undergo phase separation or collapse .    keeping this in mind we focus our attention on the effect of unequal mass of a bose- ( @xmath5 ) and a fermi - particle ( @xmath6 ) on the frequencies of collective oscillations . at this point",
    "we note that most of the studies on the collective oscillations assumed @xmath7 . in reality , for all the experimental realizations as mentioned above , @xmath8 .",
    "for example , in the case of extensively studied rb - k mixture , @xmath9 . in this paper",
    "we show that @xmath8 leads to significant alteration of the nature and the frequencies of the modes of the collective oscillations over the equal mass case @xcite . in order to calculate the frequencies of collective oscillations we adopt",
    "well established sum rule approach of many - body response theory @xcite .",
    "it has already been shown that the sum rule approach yields quite accurate results for the frequencies of collective oscillations of trapped bose - fermi mixtures @xcite .",
    "using sum rule approach , we derive analytical expressions for the frequencies of monopole and quadrupole modes of oscillations of a bose - fermi mixture with mass of a bose - particle being different from that of a fermi - particle .",
    "our expressions are generalizations of the results of ref .",
    "these analytical expressions for frequencies are then used to determine critical mass ratio @xmath10 at which character of the modes undergoes a change resulting in the modifications of the frequencies significantly .",
    "the content of the paper is as follows . in the next section we present the derivations of analytical expressions for the frequencies followed by a discussion of our results in section iii .",
    "the paper is concluded in section iv .",
    "the basic result of the sum - rule approach @xcite is that the upper bound of the lowest excitation energy is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the @xmath13-th order moment of the excitation energy associated with the excitation operator @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the frequency of excitation . here",
    "@xmath16 is the excitation energy of eigenstate @xmath17 of the hamiltonian @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , eq . ( [ frequency ] ) can be used for computation of the excitation energies by exploiting the fact that the moments @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be expressed as expectation values of the commutators between @xmath14 and @xmath18 in the ground state @xmath21 .",

    "needs to choose an appropriate excitation operator @xmath14 . in this paper",
    "we consider the monopole and the quadrupole modes of the collective oscillations .",
    "the excitation operators corresponding to these modes are defined by @xmath23 where @xmath24 stands for monopole or quadrupole modes , the indices @xmath25 denote bosons / fermions and the functions @xmath26 are given by @xmath27 for monople and @xmath28 for quadrupole modes .",
    "following @xcite we take the excitation operators as a linear combination of @xmath29 and @xmath30 to simulate the effect of mixing of boson and fermion oscillations .",
    "it is written as @xmath31 where the mixing angle @xmath32 lies between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the character of the mode is given by the value of @xmath32 , for example , @xmath35 for the bosonic and @xmath36 for the fermionic modes , @xmath37 for the in - phase oscillation , and @xmath38 for the out - of - phase oscillations of the two types of particles .",
    "the value of mixing angle for each mode is determined by minimizing the corresponding frequency .",
    "the presence of two kinds of particle leads to two types of collective oscillations for each multipole which are orthogonal to each other . out of these two modes",

    ", we first display the frequency and the mixing angle of the monopole mode as a function of coupling strength @xmath94 in fig . 1 for two different values of mass ratio , namely @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",

    "the differences in the behaviour of the mixing angle which characterizes the nature of the mode of the collective oscillations are clearly visible even in the weak interaction regime ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "for example , in the weak boson - fermion interaction regime the monopole mode is dominantly fermionic in nature for @xmath95 , whereas it becomes dominantly bosonic for @xmath96 .",

    "this result has motivated us to investigate the effect of different mass of a bose- and a fermi - particle on the collective oscillations of boson - fermion mixtures . at this stage",
    "it is natural to ask following question : is it that any mass ratio different from unity will change the behaviour of monopole mode of the collective oscillations or there exists a critical value of mass ratio @xmath100 at which change in the behaviour of monopole mode occurs ? in order to answer this question , we focus our attention on the collective oscillations of non - interacting ( @xmath101 ) boson - fermion mixture as we have already seen that effect of non - unity mass ratio is appreciable even for very small values of @xmath102 around zero . moreover , for non - interacting bose - fermi mixture one can derive analytical results for the frequencies and the mixing angle , which makes the analysis more lucid . by using the expression for the frequency of the monopole mode given by eq .",

    "for the interacting case , we obtain the value of @xmath105 by numerically minimizing the monopole mode frequency @xmath106 .",
    "the results of these numerical calculations are also displayed in fig .",
    "1 . we find that for large values of boson - fermion interaction strength both in the positive and the negative directions the monopole mode becomes coherent superposition of bosonic and fermionic oscillations .",
    "the proportion of mixing of these two types oscillations depends on the boson - fermion mass ratio and the interaction strength @xmath102 .",
    "the monopole modes corresponding to both @xmath129 and @xmath130 cases tend toward in - phase oscillations ( @xmath131 ) of the bose - fermi mixture as it approaches either the collapse or the spatial phase separation regimes .",
    "we note here that depending on the ratio of the bose - fermi mass the monopole mode follows either the lower branch characterized by purely fermionic oscillations at zero interaction to the coherent superposition of bosonic and fermionic oscillations for finite values of interaction strength or the upper branch representing purely bosonic to the coherent superposition of bosonic and fermionic oscillations .",
    "consequently , the frequency of the monopole mode show drastically different behaviours for mass ratios below and above the critical limit .",
    "moreover , from the behaviour of the monopole mode discussed above , we note that for a given mass ratio the character of the monopole mode at zero boson - fermion interaction strength can be employed to predict the nature of this mode at finite values of the interaction strength .",
    "for example , another experimentally achieved bose - fermi mixture composed of @xmath0 and @xmath1 has mass ratio @xmath132 , which is less than 1.25 . from the above discussion",
