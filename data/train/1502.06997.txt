    "the main requirement is to create an electronics capable to amplify the signal up to 80 db at 32 khz , and in the same time to maintain low noise level so that the output signal can be measured by ordinary dc voltmeter .",

    "the amplification is 80 db , due to the requirement that the entire circuit has to be placed in a single small metal box .",

    "the benefit of using wider filter in the second module is that it is easy to adjust its center frequency to the frequency of the first resonance amplifier .",

    "results from the measurement are presented in fig .",

    "it is seen that transfer function is linear for input voltages above 100 @xmath49v and has small deviations from the linearity for voltages below 100 @xmath49v .",
    "the nonlinearity in the transfer function at small input signal levels is mainly due to the nonlinearities in the ac - dc converter ad636 .",
    "@xcite    the smallest voltage signal measured with this electronics is 4 @xmath49v , which is much higher than the total noise referenced to the input of the amplifier 25 nv .",
