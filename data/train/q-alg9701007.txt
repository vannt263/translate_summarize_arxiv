    "each of these different units is referred to as a `` zone ''  @xcite . now",
    "the restriction in our theorem implies that @xmath587 and hence that our recurrences essentially act within the zeroth zone of the @xmath391-system only . to obtain @xmath0-supernomial identities which are true for @xmath588 one needs to generalize the @xmath0-supernomials to satisfy the recurrences implied by the full set of zones of the @xmath391-system .",
    "such modified @xmath0-supernomials would thus reflect the complete continued fraction expansion of @xmath3 and not just its integer part .",
    "indeed polynomial boson  fermion identities ( related to the gordon  gllnitz identities ) with finitization parameter @xmath11 beyond zone zero have been found in refs .",
    "it would be an interesting problem to generalize these to identities depending on multiple finitization parameters , using more general @xmath0-supernomials .",
    "another point of interest is the combinatorial interpretation of the bosonic and fermionic polynomials of equations and . for @xmath589 ( @xmath590",
    "these polynomials correspond to one - dimensional configuration sums of solvable lattice models  @xcite . in those cases",
    "we have an interpretation in terms of weighted lattice paths .",
    "another interpretation , in terms of partitions with prescribed hook differences , exists for @xmath246  @xcite . for the general @xmath18-dimensional case , however ,",
    "we have not been able to generalize either of these .",
    "what is possible is to give a simple interpretation in terms of lattice paths when @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , instead of working with lattice paths , we give an equivalent matrix formulation in the following .",
    "fix an integer @xmath591 and define a family of incidence matrices @xmath592 as follows : @xmath593 with @xmath594 the @xmath595 identity matrix and @xmath596 the incidence matrix of the lie algebra a@xmath597 , with entries @xmath598 .",
