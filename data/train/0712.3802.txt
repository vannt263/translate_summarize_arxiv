    "much has been written , in the scientific literature , about the hyperbolicity of billiards in two dimensions . so much that general principles have even been devised for the ` design of billiards with nonvanishing lyapunov exponents ' .",
    "the expression is taken from the title of the 1986 seminal paper by wojtkowski @xcite , in which he beautifully links the question of exponential instability ( i.e. , positivity of a lyapunov exponent ) to a few simple observations from geometrical optics . by means of the powerful _ invariant cone technique _",
    "@xcite , wojtkowski gives sufficient conditions for a planar billiard  to have nonzero lyapunov exponents , this implying a fuller range of hyperbolicproperties via the general results of katok and strelcyn on pesin s theory for dynamical systems with singularities @xcite .",
    "wojtkowski s conditions are rather undemanding for _ dispersing _ and _ semidispersing _ billiards ( i.e. , billiards in a domain @xmath0 , a.k.a .",
    "_ table _ , whose boundary is the finite union of smooth convex pieces , when seen from inside @xmath1 ) , and much more restrictive for _ focusing _ , _ semifocusing _ and _ mixed _ billiards ( that is , cases when @xmath2 is made up ",
    "completely or partially , respectively  by concave pieces ) .",
    "( both in the dispersing and in the focusing case , the prefix semi- means that @xmath2 has some flat parts as well . ) for the latter type of billiards , further work has been done by markarian @xcite , donnay @xcite and bunimovich @xcite ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap .  9 ) for an overview of the subject and @xcite for an interesting variation ) .",
    "if we call _ boundary component _ each smooth piece of @xmath3 , one of the conditions in @xcite is that the inner semiosculating disc at any given point of a focusing boundary component must not intersect other components , or the semiosculating discs relative to other focusing components ( @xcite has a similar condition ) .",
    "this is required in order to implement the so - called _ defocusing mechanism _ ,",
    "which can be loosely described like this : one wants diverging beams of trajectories to keep diverging after every collision with the boundary .",
    "but at a focusing portion of the boundary a diverging beam may be bounced back as a converging beam .",
    "a solution around this problem is to let the converging beam travel untouched for a sufficienly long time until the trajectories focus among themselves and then start to diverge again .",
    "the defocusing mechanism is the closest extension of sinai s original idea of extracting hyperbolicity from the expanding features of dispersing boundaries @xcite . at least to our knowledge",
    ", it has remained unsurpassed since bunimovich introduced it in 1974 @xcite , to become very popular a few years later , when it was used to work out the famous stadium billiard  @xcite .",
    "sticking too much to the standard principles , however , creates a problem and somehow a paradox .",
    "the condition on the semiosculating discs , and each of its later analogues , requires a table with focusing components to have a diameter of the order of the largest radius of curvature among the focusing points of the boundary . to illustrate how this may seem a paradox ,",
    "consider the following example : take a unit square and replace three of its sides with circular arcs of curvature @xmath4 having their endpoints in the vertices of the square . in this paper",
    "we use the convention that the curvature is positive at focusing points of the boundary and negative at dispersing points , so the arcs are convex relative to the interior of the square ; the condition @xmath5 ensures that each pair of adjacent arcs intersects only at the common endpoint .",
    "the resulting billiard  is semidispersing , thus belongs to the standard class and is well - know to be uniformly hyperbolic , bernoulli , and so on @xcite .",
    "now perturb the fourth side into a focusing circular arc of curvature @xmath6 .",
    "now matter how small the perturbation , this new billiard  will never satisfy wojtkowski s principle and is not currently known to be hyperbolic , although it presumably is .",
    "this may not sound too strange .",
    "after all , certain perturbations of dispersing billiards are known to possess elliptic islands @xcite . but",
    "the paradox is that the smaller the perturbation , the less adequate the standard technique ; that is , the closer the billiard  comes to be dispersing , the worse the method applies which is supposed to exploit the dispersing nature of the boundaries .",
    "up until @xmath7 , at which point everything suddenly , and abruptly , works again to the fullest power of the theory of hyperbolic  billiards .    here",
    "we address this problem and , although we can not yet prove that the perturbed square billiard  is hyperbolic , we devise a couple of models that make clear what the difficulties are in extending the current methodology .",
    "these billiards , which are modifications of the example just discussed , are depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig - t1intro ] and [ fig - t2intro ] .",
    "they are indeed two families of billiards , as we are interested in the case when the curvature of the focusing boundary goes to zero .",
    "we define an invariant cone bundle that exploits the fact that the focusing component is nearly flat , and thus almost always acts as a semidispersing boundary .",
    "[ fig - t1intro ]    in any event , we are able to answer the following questions in the affirmative :    1 .",
    "can one design a billiard  whose hyperbolicity is proved via a set of invariant cones that does not use exclusively the dispersing / defocusing mechanism for beams of trajectories ? 2 .",
    "[ pt2 ] can one construct a family of hyperbolic  billiard  tables with a ( nonvanishing ) focusing component whose maximum curvature approaches zero , and such that the area of the table is bounded above ?",
    "[ pt3 ] can one require the diameter to be bounded above as well ?",
    "4 .   are these billiards ergodic ? ( this will be proved in @xcite . )",
    "[ fig - t2intro ]    points [ pt2 ] and [ pt3 ] show , independently of the method utilized , that one can go beyond the apparent implication ` almost flat focusing boundaries imply very large tables ' .",
    "this is the plan of the paper : in section [ sec - prel ] we review the basic definitions of billiard  dynamics . in section [ sec - cones ]",
    "we present and adapt wojtkowsky s theory of invariant cones derived from geometrical optics . in section [ sec - hyp ]",
    "we define the first of our models and choose suitable cones to prove its hyperbolicity . in section [ sec - conf ] we show that the billiard  introduced before can be chosen with a bounded area , and finally we present a second model which has a bounded diameter as well .",
