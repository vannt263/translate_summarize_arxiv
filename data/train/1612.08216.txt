    "theoretical studies of phase - segregated bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) mixtures and the experimental realization of such systems have opened up a new avenue for investigating many interesting properties of inhomogeneous becs , in particular the superfluid dynamics of the interface . on the one hand ,",
    "one has focused on the exploration of hydrodynamic interface instabilities , such as the kelvin - helmholtz instability @xcite , the rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite and the richtmayer - meshkov instability @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", one has studied several characteristics specific to interfaces , such as the interfacial tension @xcite and capillary wave excitations , starting by solving approximately the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equations in two distinct regimes of weak and strong segregation @xcite .",
    "dynamical properties of becs are often studied numerically by solving the time - dependent gp equations with the pseudospectral method or via diagonization of the bdg equations .",
    "dispersion relations can to some extent be determined analytically through a variational method applied to the gp action or by solving the gp equations or bdg equations in asymptotic regimes such as the long wavelength limit .",
    "however , the analytical studies have either been limited to special cases or have ignored the structure of the interface on length scales smaller than or equal to the healing length .",
    "our aim in this paper is to provide a detailed analytical solution of a model which possesses the essential physical ingredients of gp theory , but is different from it and much easier to solve . in ref.@xcite",
    "the model defined through the double - parabola approximation ( dpa ) was shown to be a simple but useful approach for treating _",
    "static _ interfacial problems in phase - segregated becs .",
    "the dpa has even played a constructive role in conjecturing new exact solutions to the gp equations @xcite .",
    "the present paper proposes the _ dynamical _ counterpart of this model . here",
    ", the dpa in combination with the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations allow us to derive analytical expressions for ripplon excitations and their dispersion relation .",
    "these excitations are nambu - goldstone ( ng ) modes associated with the broken symmetries in this inhomogeneous system .",
    "surface phonons ( at an interface ) can be studied in a similar fashion but are not addressed in this paper .",
    "a ripplon is a capillary wave traveling along the interface , causing it to undulate perpendicular to its planar projection , and is recognized as the primary lowest - energy excitation within the bogoliubov spectrum . in a uniform external potential",
    "the dispersion relation of ripplons , in the long - wavelength limit , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the angular frequency and @xmath11 the wave number of the capillary wave , can be obtained by applying a linear approximation to the gp theory leading to young - laplace - like equations .",
    "this result coincidences with the dispersion relation of a classical fluid .",
    "the secondary low - energy excitations are phonons . while bulk phonons correspond to the propagation of the pressure waves within a condensate in bulk , localized surface phonons with dispersion @xmath12",
    "are predicted at the interface , propagating at a speed lower than the speed of sound .",
    "drawing an analogy to mechanical waves , ripplons have an important transverse character , while surface phonons are mainly longitudinal in nature .",
    "let us first recall the familiar frame - work .",
    "we assume a uniform external potential ( which without loss of generality can be set to zero ) and start from the gp lagrangian density @xcite @xmath13 with hamiltonian density @xmath14 + g_{12 } \\lvert\\psi_1\\rvert^2 \\lvert\\psi_2\\rvert^2.\\ ] ] for atomic species @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the wave function of the condensate or  order parameter \" , @xmath17 the atomic mass , @xmath18 the repulsive intra - species interaction strength , @xmath19 the repulsive inter - species interaction strength and @xmath20 the intra - species ( for @xmath21 ) or inter - species ( for @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) @xmath24-wave scattering length .    by introducing the dimensionless quantities , @xmath25 , with @xmath26 the healing length and",

    "next we make a transformation of the dimensionless lagrangian density by writing @xmath37 we then have a lagrangian density in terms of the new order parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 - \\hat{\\mathcal{v } } ( \\phi_1,\\phi_2),\\ ] ] in which the potential @xmath40 takes the form @xmath41 + k \\lvert\\phi_1\\rvert^2 \\lvert\\phi_2\\rvert^2.\\ ] ] recall that for @xmath42 the two components are immiscible and a phase - segregated bec forms @xcite .",
    "we assume that the planar interface ( without excitation ) is located at @xmath43 and the condensates 1 and 2 reside in half - spaces @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "we call the bec mixture _ symmetric _ when the atomic masses are equal , @xmath46 ( a frequently fulfilled condition ) , _ and _ the intra - species interaction strengths are equal @xmath47 ( a special requirement ) . furthermore ,",
    "for a symmetric mixture at bulk two - phase coexistence also the bulk densities are equal , @xmath48 , and so are the chemical potentials . consequently , @xmath49 for a symmetric mixture .",
    "we recall the dimensionless mean - field dpa gp lagrangian density @xcite @xmath50 - \\hat{\\mathcal{v}}_{\\mathrm{dpa}}(\\phi_1,\\phi_2),\\ ] ] where @xmath51 takes the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 . in the labels @xmath15 and @xmath54 comply with the following important convention , which we will henceforth maintain _ throughout this paper _ : @xmath55 this potential is the combination of two paraboloids obtained by the expansions of the potential in gp theory about bulk condensate 1 , @xmath56 , for the half - space @xmath57 , and bulk condensate 2 , @xmath58 , for the half - space @xmath59 . in bulk ,",
    "time derivatives and spatial gradients in the lagrangian density vanish and the minimum of the potential , @xmath60 , is the same as in the gp theory , see @xcite .    by extremizing the action with the lagrangian density with respect to a variation @xmath61 , we obtain the dpa to the time - dependent gp equations , @xmath62 where @xmath63 . these equations are decoupled , which greatly simplifies the problem .",
    "although most terms are linear in the order parameters , there is an important nonlinearity through the nontrivial dependence on the phase of the order parameter .",
    "the equations can also be obtained directly from the ( exact ) gp equations by expanding the amplitudes to first order in the perturbations about their bulk values . to see this , we make use of the original expansions that define the dpa @xcite @xmath64 we observe that keeping contributions of zeroth and first order in the @xmath65 s and @xmath66 s reproduces identically .",
    "alternatively , one can derive these equations  hydrodynamically \" by combining a bernoulli - type of equation and the continuity equation , obtained by taking the variation of the amplitudes and the phases of the order parameters , respectively @xcite .",
    "for a planar interface at @xmath67 , the static interface profiles are real solutions of the form of time - independent stationary states @xmath68 , with @xmath69 , while the ( unperturbed ) system is translationally invariant along @xmath70 and @xmath71 directions . by matching the functions and their first derivatives at @xmath67 and using the boundary conditions @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we obtain @xmath74 note that the second derivative of these profiles is discontinuous at the interface .    after inserting the real and time - independent solutions in , we multiply the equation for condensate @xmath15 by @xmath75 and the equation for condensate @xmath54 by @xmath76 , then add them up and integrate the expression over @xmath77 .",
    "the result is a constant and represents the constant of motion in dpa , i.e. , @xmath78 the value of the constant must be fixed so that the minimum of @xmath51 , given in , is respected in each of the ( homogeneous ) bulk phases .",
    "note that the first term in the lhs of this equation is the sum of gradients squared of the two stationary solutions and is usually called the gradient energy .",
    "considering low - energy interfacial excitations such as ripplons and surface phonons , or even more general excitations , we perturb the complex order parameters about their ( real ) stationary state forms @xmath79 in which @xmath80 is assumed to be a small perturbation of the value of @xmath81 .",
    "this implies that the phase angle @xmath82 of @xmath38 is small ( i.e. , of the order of im@xmath83 ) in regions where @xmath81 is close to its bulk value ( which is unity ) . in gp theory , by taking this perturbation into the gp equations , we can derive the bdg equations to first order in @xmath84 .",
    "alternatively , the bdg equations can be derived by including the variation @xmath85 directly in the gp action , using . for a brief recapitulation of these fundamental equations ,",
    "see appendix  [ sec : gptheory ] .    within the dpa , however ,",
    "a considerable simplification of these bdg equations can be obtained , while keeping  as we shall show  the essential physics of our problem intact .",
    "we derive the dpa to the bdg equations directly as follows .",
    "firstly , we insert the perturbed order parameter into the time - dependent dpa to the gp equations .",
    "this leads to @xmath86 next , this can be rewritten in terms of the perturbations alone if we make the additional assumption that the phase angle @xmath82 is small .",
    "this is valid provided @xmath87 .",
    "since condensate @xmath15 is close to its bulk density in the half - space concerned , this assumption is appropriate within the dpa strategy .",
    "then , to first order in the @xmath84 , @xmath88 with the definition @xmath89 and @xmath90 is considered small ( compared to 1 ) in the usual dpa spirit .",
    "this is a good approximation away from the interface , whereas close to the interface the upper bound is @xmath91 , as can be seen from .    consequently , can be written in the more canonical form , @xmath92 which _ defines _ our dpa model at the level of the bdg equations .",
    "we will see shortly that the correction term @xmath93 in these equations is crucially important to obtain the correct physics ( including the correct  zero modes \" ) within the dpa .    for completeness",
    "we also give the explicit expressions for the modulus and the phase angle of the perturbed wave function to the lowest relevant orders in the perturbation and in the deviations from bulk values , @xmath94 this shows that @xmath95 is of first order in @xmath82 , but of zeroth order in the @xmath65 , whereas @xmath96 is of first order in the @xmath65 ( or smaller ) .",
    "we conclude that terms of order @xmath97 can be neglected , whereas terms of order @xmath98 ought to be kept .    based on these insights",
    "we make the observation that the dpa procedure commutes with the derivation of the bdg equations .",
    "indeed , starting from the exact bdg equations ( see appendix  [ sec : gptheory ] ) and applying and also leads to as we will now show .",
    "the exact bdg equations , derived from gp theory , read @xmath99 \\delta\\phi_j + \\phi_{j0}^2 \\delta\\phi_j^{\\ast } + k \\phi_{j0}\\phi_{j'0 } ( \\delta\\phi_{j ' } + \\delta\\phi_{j'}^{\\ast } ) , \\ ; j=1,2 \\ ; ( j \\ne j')\\ ] ] if we consider the half - space in which condensate @xmath15 is close to its bulk state , we can apply and . applying the dpa we can then safely neglect the second - order quantities @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "this already reduces the equation to @xmath102 \\delta\\phi_j + \\phi_{j0}^2 \\delta\\phi_j^{\\ast } , \\ ; \\mbox{with } \\ ; \\phi_{j0 } = 1 + \\epsilon_{j0}\\ ] ] next we apply and expand , to obtain @xmath103 \\delta\\phi_j + ( 1 + 2\\epsilon_{j0 } ) \\delta\\phi_j^{\\ast}\\ ] ] subsequently we regroup terms and neglect @xmath97 but keep @xmath98 as we have explained .",
    "this leads to @xmath104 \\delta\\phi_j + \\delta\\phi_j^{\\ast}+\\epsilon_{j0 } ( \\delta\\phi_j - \\delta\\phi_j^{\\ast}),\\ ] ] which is identical to the first equation in .",
    "conversely , considering the half space in which condensate @xmath54 is close to its bulk state , prompts us to neglect the second - order quantities @xmath105 and @xmath106 , so that only the following terms remain , @xmath107 \\delta\\phi_j\\ ] ] after writing @xmath108 and keeping only the leading order , since @xmath84 is already of first order in the dpa , this equation reproduces the second equation in , if we take into account the labeling convention .",
    "this completes the alternative derivation of .    following the bogoliubov analysis",
    ", we now write a general @xmath84 as a linear superposition of different fourier - like modes @xmath109,\\ ] ] where the reduced wave vector @xmath110 and reduced frequency @xmath111 for each mode of the surface wave are defined by @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "note that @xmath114 .",
    "note also that for a symmetric bec mixture at two - phase coexistence the reduced frequencies @xmath115 are the same for both condensates .",
    "for an interfacial excitation ( a ripplon or , also , a localized phonon ) propagating along a direction , say @xmath70 , parallel to the topological defect ( i.e. , the interface midplane ) , the problem simplifies to a two - dimensional one , with @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118,\\ ] ]    we define the interface displacement @xmath119 and its dimensionless counterparts @xmath120 through the position along @xmath77 where the order parameters  intersect \" , @xmath121 note that @xmath122 in the absence of an excitation .",
    "the converse need not be true .",
    "for example , interface breather modes are excitations for which we can fix @xmath122 for all times . for a ripplon mode ,",
    "the interface displacement is a transverse wave traveling along @xmath70 .",
    "we consider a ripplon mode of fixed wavelength and study its properties . for concreteness ,",
    "let @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the amplitude of the interface displacement @xmath125 .",
    "importantly , we assume the excitation is small in the sense that @xmath126 .",
    "this means that the healing lengths are large compared to the interface displacement and we anticipate that interface structure plays an important physical role in this regime .    for the order parameters associated with this ripplon",
    "the following form is proposed , @xmath127 featuring the rigid - shift displacement @xmath128 and its dimensionless counterparts @xmath129 .",
    "these are of the same form as , but the amplitudes may differ , i.e. , @xmath130 further , the real function @xmath131 incorporates amplitude fluctuations beyond the bare rigid shift of the static profile already incorporated in the argument of @xmath132 .",
    "the presence of @xmath131 can cause a ( condensate - dependent ) additional shift and also a deformation of the interface and this is the physical reason for a possible difference between the functions @xmath133 and @xmath125 .",
    "finally , the real function @xmath82 contains the phase fluctuations ( relative to @xmath134 ) . for the specific interface displacement consistency of the transverse interface displacement velocity with the phase fluctuation of each component , @xmath135 and satisfaction of the hydrodynamic equation of continuity , for each component ,",
    "@xmath136 imply the following forms to first order in the rigid - shift displacement amplitude @xmath137 , @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are ( real ) functions that are localized about the interface , since a ripplon is a localised ng mode , whose effect decays when we move away from the interface into the bulk .",
    "these functions are related to one another through the continuity equation , which , after scaling the variables , takes the form @xmath141 to first order in the amplitude @xmath137 .",
    "these yet unknown functions @xmath139 and @xmath140 , which in general also depend on @xmath142 and @xmath115 , contain the interesting physics of the excitation . for @xmath143",
    "the interface is merely rigidly shifted with respect to its unperturbed state . for @xmath144 the interface structure may undergo a change",
    "further , the properties and form of @xmath145 are of course crucial for the existence of a superfluid velocity profile .",
    "note that far away from the interface ( in the  far field \" ) , where condensate @xmath15 is present in bulk , we can approximate @xmath146 and the equation of continuity simplifies to @xmath147    we now expand @xmath38 in to first order in @xmath148 and match it with @xmath38 in using the term corresponding to wave number @xmath11 in @xmath84 given in .",
    "this leads to the following results @xmath149 where we have included the subscript @xmath11 in the functions @xmath150 and @xmath151 to anticipate their explicit dependence on the wave number .",
    "note that the separation of the derivative part and the part containing @xmath152 in the equation for @xmath153 is not unique and depends on the precise form of the proposed order parameter function .",
    "in contrast , the expression for @xmath154 is generally valid , since it is merely a tautology featuring the yet unknown function @xmath155 .",
    "the continuity conditions , at the interface ( @xmath67 ) , for these functions and their first derivatives are a nontrivial problem in general .",
    "we will see in the next subsection how these conditions naturally manifest themselves in the dpa model .",
    "we can already anticipate that a discontinuous second derivative in @xmath81 at the interface , typical for dpa profiles , generates a discontinuous first derivative in @xmath156 .",
    "in fact , even a discontinuity in @xmath156 at the interface is possible , and this seems to arise naturally in the strong segregation limit , in which the exact gp interface profile ( as well as its dpa counterpart ) displays a discontinuous first derivative .",
    "we conclude that continuity conditions on @xmath156 have to be examined carefully case by case . since the structure of the interface is by and large determined by the properties of @xmath81 and its first derivative , it is apt to denote the boundary conditions on @xmath156 by  structural \" boundary conditions .",
    "a different situation arises when it comes to @xmath157 . in view of",
    ", the function @xmath155 is entangled with the phase that defines the velocity potential of the superfluid .",
    "the continuity , at the interface , of the first derivative of @xmath155 , is a prerequisite for the fluid mechanical continuity of the transverse velocity of the interface displacement .",
    "therefore , we may denote the requirement of continuity of the first derivative of @xmath157 at the interface by ",
    "hydrodynamical \" boundary condition .",
    "naturally , we require @xmath157 itself to be continuous also ( since a delta - function - like singularity in the transverse velocity would be unacceptable ) .      by substituting @xmath158 with the bogoliubov form corresponding to fixed wave number @xmath11 in into the dpa for the bdg equations ,",
    "we obtain the following dpa for the bdg equations in terms of @xmath156 and @xmath157 , @xmath159 where @xmath160 .",
    "to test the usefulness of these equations , we first apply them to obtain the zero modes within dpa . in the limit @xmath161 and",
    "@xmath162 the dpa bdg equations reduce to @xmath163    we now show that these equations are solved by the functions that are precisely the dpa applied to the exact zero modes of the bdg equations . to see this ,",
    "consider the exact zero modes given in and of appendix a. then write , as usual in the dpa formalism , @xmath164 where the expressions for the supposedly small ( compared to unity ) quantities @xmath90 and @xmath165 can be read off from . at the interface",
    "@xmath90 and @xmath165 can not both be small , but fortunately they are well bounded in absolute value by @xmath166 and @xmath167 , respectively .",
    "now recall that in dpa calculations we neglect contributions of second and higher order in the @xmath65 s and @xmath66 s .",
    "we concentrate first on the nontrivial second equation of , and test a solution of the form @xmath81 .",
    "we get @xmath168 where we have neglected the term of second order in @xmath90 .",
    "the remaining three equations are trivial to test and the solutions are easily identified .",
    "altogether , we find that the dpa bdg equations are solved by zero modes of the form @xmath169 and @xmath170 provided the dpa solutions of the static order parameters are used and calculations are carried out to , and including , first - order terms in the deviations @xmath65 and @xmath66 from bulk values .",
    "returning now to the non - zero modes , we emphasize that the nontrivial second differential equation of embodies the equation of continuity , to first order in @xmath90 .",
    "this can be seen by using the forms and by using also @xmath171 , which is valid to first order in @xmath90 , as follows from for a static solution .",
    "the second equation of therefore represents _ the dpa to the continuity equation _ and is valid for all distances , at and away from the interface .    to make further progress towards the general solutions of the dpa bdg equations , we recall that the correction term in the second equation of contains the factor @xmath172 , which is itself already a first - order correction in the dpa strategy",
    "consequently , here it is sufficient to take into account only the contribution to @xmath157 calculated in the absence of the correction term .",
    "we will deal with this systematically in the frame - work of perturbation theory .",
    "firstly , let us denote by @xmath173 and @xmath174 the  zeroth - order \" solutions of the dpa bdg equations in the absence of the term @xmath175 in .",
    "these equations are solved by the exponentially localized functions @xmath176 in which the exponents are @xmath177 note that the functions @xmath178 and @xmath179 need no superscript because no approximation is made in their differential equations .",
    "we note that the following relations hold among the coefficients ( since exponentials with different decay are , in general , independent ) , @xmath180 there remain 4 undetermined coefficients ( the @xmath181 and the @xmath182 ) for each bec component .",
    "it is instructive to give also the zeroth - order solutions in terms of the @xmath183 and @xmath184 , because some of these are just single exponentials , @xmath185 where the @xmath182 are the same as in and @xmath186    now we are prepared to return to the problem of solving the first two dpa bdg equations in considering the term @xmath175 perturbatively .",
    "note that this term is small in the weak - segregation limit , where @xmath187 is small , but we are interested in using the approximation for all @xmath187 .",
    "therefore we assume @xmath188 to be small and perform a perturbation calculation to first order in the amplitude of this quantity , which we call @xmath189 , i.e. , @xmath190 we therefore expand , @xmath191    our main task now is to find the solutions of the _ inhomogeneous _ system @xmath192 note that we have used the explicit form of @xmath81 in dpa and @xmath193 is given by the second equation of .",
    "the solutions of these  first - order \" equations consist of a particular solution complemented by an arbitrary solution of the _ homogeneous _ system , which is by definition the system but without the last term .",
    "summarizing , we can write the general solution to the first two inhomogeneous dpa bdg equations in formally as follows , to first order in @xmath189 , @xmath194 the superscript @xmath195 refers to the particular solution of the system and the superscript @xmath196 refers to an arbitrary solution of the homogeneous system , which coincides formally with an arbitrary solution of the zeroth - order system .",
    "after inspection of the system we can write the particular solutions in the form @xmath197 where the ( finite ) coefficients @xmath198 and @xmath199 are found to satisfy the following equations @xmath200 this leads to the following expressions , which are useful for @xmath201 , @xmath202    the arbitrary homogeneous solutions present in the  first - order correction \" are of the form @xmath203 note that without loss of generality , we can choose some of the coefficients to be equal to zero . in particular , we have the freedom to choose one of the coefficients in @xmath153 or @xmath154 to set the scale of the excitation .",
    "if we choose to fix @xmath204 , we do not need to introduce any first - order correction to it and can thus set @xmath205 .",
    "this entails also @xmath206 in view of . since",
    ", furthermore , @xmath207 is related to @xmath208 through the same constraint , we observe that the presence of the homogeneous solutions generates only one additional unknown , say @xmath208 .",
    "we now proceed to the discussion of the full solution of our system of 4 differential equations . even though the two pairs of equations are independent , their solutions get coupled through suitable boundary conditions , which reduce the number of undetermined coefficients .",
    "indeed , we must invoke several continuity conditions at the interface .",
    "firstly , for @xmath209 ( excluding the case of total segregation ) it is reasonable to impose _ continuity _ of all solutions at the interface , since the zero modes are continuous at the interface , in gp theory as well as in the dpa , and we aim at building a dynamical dpa with no more singularities than those present in the static dpa .",
    "this leads to the following relations , @xmath210 while the coefficients @xmath181 and @xmath211 of the  zeroth - order \" homogeneous solutions satisfy .",
    "next , we require continuity of the  hydrodynamic \" amplitude , i.e. , the first derivative of @xmath157 , at the interface .",
    "this gives @xmath212 now we are left with ( only ) one undetermined coefficient per bec component , assuming that we fix @xmath204 .",
    "upon inspection of our system of differential equations with these 3 boundary conditions , we conclude that it is not necessary to include an extra homogeneous solution in the first - order perturbation scheme .",
    "the boundary conditions can all be satisfied using just the particular solution as the perturbation .",
    "so we can simplify the analysis and choose @xmath213 , which implies also @xmath214 .",
    "we are now in a position to generate all the modes analytically , within the dpa , for values of the reduced wave numbers @xmath142 and reduced frequencies @xmath115 that are arbitrarily chosen , as long as the exponents @xmath215 and @xmath216 , defined in , are real numbers .",
    "clearly , this mathematical set of modes is larger than the physical subset that satisfies the yet undetermined dispersion relation ( the physical constraint expressing the dependence of the frequency on the wave number ) .",
    "we will turn to the derivation of the dispersion relation later , but for now , we consider the frequencies and wave numbers as independent parameters and present figures illustrating functions @xmath156 and @xmath157 that satisfy all our approximations so far .",
    "the functions are of the form , with 8 coefficients that must satisfy the 7 equations , , , and .",

    "this phenomenon implies a periodic variation of the extent to which phase segregation takes place .",
    "a decrease in the midpoint density is an apparent strengthening of segregation between the condensates , while a midpoint density increase corresponds to more mutual penetration and thus a weakening of segregation .",
    "performing a first - order taylor expansion of the common midpoint densities about the unperturbed midpoint value @xmath332 , we find that the segregation modulation is described by the following result , recalling @xmath333 , @xmath334 is the unperturbed midpoint value .",

    "we verify whether the interface displacement velocity is consistent with the phase fluctuation of each component , as expressed by . for this",
    "it suffices to use for the functions @xmath155 and just the leading term in .",

    "this is indeed the case .",
    "in this paper we have developed a dynamic double parabola approximation , starting from the static dpa model previously studied . to this end , we first derived a dpa to the time - dependent gp equations . from these we derived dpa bdg equations and so defined a model for studying ripplon excitations .",
    "we have also shown that these approximations commute : applying a dpa to the original bdg equations derived from the time - dependent gp equations , leads to the same model . within this model",
    "we established explicit mathematical dpa solutions for ripplons for all distances near to and far from the interface and checked that the formalism allows one to obtain correct zero modes consistent with exact relations in gp theory .",
    "the accuracy of the dpa relies on the assumption that both @xmath341 and @xmath342 be small compared to unity .",
    "these requirements are , strictly speaking , mutually incompatible since the first parameter is only small for strong segregation and the second only for weak segregation . however , the fact that both parameters are bounded from above by unity renders the dpa useful in all segregation regimes .",
    "the usefulness of the dpa was already established for calculating static properties analytically @xcite and it emerges here once more in the context of time - dependent properties and phenomena .    using the dpa solutions for the modes in the long wavelength limit , we derived a family of modes and used that to define a physical dpa ripplon .",
    "for this type of perturbation we derived a dispersion relation @xmath4 directly from the dpa bdg equations combined in integral form and used as a constraint on allowed values for frequencies and wave numbers . in the long wavelength limit",
    "the dispersion relation carries the correct wave number dependence @xmath309 and satisfies the correct mean - field scaling behavior in the weak segregation limit , reproducing the exponent @xmath343 describing the dependence of the square root of the interfacial tension on the interaction strength difference @xmath336 .",
    "the leading term in the dispersion relation features the static interfacial tension derived earlier within the dpa @xcite .",
    "therefore , the dynamic dpa fully embodies the static dpa .",
    "the next - to - leading term in the dispersion relation , of order @xmath5 , is also derived analytically for all interaction strengths @xmath235 .",
    "this term features its own exponent @xmath344 , implying that the correction vanishes faster than the leading term for @xmath345 .",
    "the correction term has to our knowledge not received much attention in the literature , the only exception we know of being a result derived in the strong segregation limit by mishonov @xcite . comparing our correction factor in @xmath314 , which is 1 + @xmath346 in , for @xmath347 , with mishonov s correction factor in @xmath314 , which we estimated to be @xmath348 , would indicate that his correction is significantly larger than ours .",
    "this discrepancy merits further investigation .",
    "the deviation from the @xmath309 dispersion at finite wavelength is a prediction that can be verified experimentally .",
    "state - of - the - art experiments of bec in ( quasi-)uniform optical - box traps @xcite would be the appropriate arena for testing this result .",

    "its magnitude is of order @xmath349 , with @xmath7 the phase velocity and @xmath8 the sound velocity .",
    "the deformation consists of an enhancement of the amplitude of the wave for all types of mixtures . for generic asymmetric mixtures consisting of condensates with unequal healing lengths",
    "@xmath338 an additional modulation is predicted of the common value of the condensate densities at the interface .",
    "this oscillation of the midpoint density is reminiscent of what would happen in the presence of a longitudinal breather mode .",
