    "it has long been recognized that neutron stars ( nss ) may have received large kick velocities at birth .",

    "second , while large space velocities can in principle be accounted for by binary break - up ( see iben & tutukov 1996 ) , many observed characteristics of ns binaries can be explained only if there is a finite kick at ns birth ( e.g. , dewey & cordes 1987 ; yamaoka et al .  1993 ; kaspi et al .  1996 ; fryer & kalogera  1997 ; fryer et al .",

    "in addition , direct observations of many nearby supernovae ( e.g. , wang 2004 ; leonard & filippenko 2004 ) and supernova remnants ( e.g. hwang et al . 2004 ) show that supernova explosions are not spherically symmetric , consistent with the existence of ns kicks .",
    "while the evidence for ns kicks is unequivocal , the physical origin remains unclear .",
    "the proposed mechanisms include hydrodynamical instabilities in the collapsed supernova core , asymmetric neutrino emission induced by super strong magnetic fields and post - natal electromagnetic boost ( see lai 2004 ; janka et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ; see  4 ) .",
    "one of the reasons that it has been difficult to spin down the kick mechanisms is the lack of correlation between ns velocity and the other properties of nss .",
    "the situation has changed with the recent x - ray observations of the compact x - ray nebulae of several young pulsars , which indicate an approximate alignment between the pulsar proper motion and its spin axis ( see lai et al .",
    "2001 ; romani & ng 2003 ) . for a number of ns binary systems",
    ", possible spin - kick relationship can be probed from the observed binary property ( e.g. geodetic precession ; see  3 ) .",
    "it is therefore useful to see whether a consistent picture about ns kicks can be obtained from the two sets of observational constraints .    in this paper",
    "we seek empirical constraints on the kick mechanism .",
    "we are particularly interested in the possible alignment / misalignment between the kick and the angular momentum of the ns , and how such alignment / misalignment depends on the ns initial spin period . in",
    " 2 , we summarize and update relevant observational data on isolated pulsars .",
    "in addition to several young pulsars for which the spin axis can be measured from the pulsar wind nebula , one can also constrain the spin axis from well - calibrated polarization data .",
    "we critically assess the information from such polarization study and demonstrate a correlation between spin axis and proper motion for these pulsars ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "in  3 we discuss constraints on ns kicks in various types of ns binaries .",
    "in addition to several well - studied ns / ns binaries , we also consider other types of binaries , such as pulsar / main - sequence and pulsar / white - dwarf binaries .",
    "we show that in general , the kick direction is misaligned with the ns spin axis .",
    "we discuss the implications of our findings in  4 .",
    "by now a number of statistic studies on pulsar velocity have been carried out ( e.g. , lyne and lorimer 1994 ; lorimer et al .",
    "1997 ; hansen & phinney 1997 ; cordes & chernoff 1998 ; arzoumanian et al  2002 ; hobbs et al . 2005 ) .",

    "an analysis of the velocities of 14 pulsars with parallax by chatterjee et al .",
    "( 2005 ) yields a similar result ( with @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "another recent study of 73 young pulsars by hobbs et al .",
    "( 2005 ) gives a mean 3d pulsar velocity of @xmath8 , consistent with a single gaussian distribution .",
    "despite some early claims , there is currently no statistically significant correlation between the pulsar velocity and the period or the dipole magnetic field strength ( as inferred from @xmath9 ) ( e.g. , lorimer et al .",
    "this lack of correlation is not surprising given the large systematic error in the analysis . from a physics point of view , it is also not surprising : ( 1 ) the observed spin period for young pulsars is 10  ms or longer , much too slow compared to the breakup rotation rate of a ns ( period 1  ms or less ) ; such a slow rotation would not play any dynamically important role in the supernova explosion .",
    "( 2 ) the currently observed dipole field of pulsars is @xmath10  g , much weaker than the @xmath11  g fields required for magnetic field to affect the explosion dynamics or neutrino emission in proto - nss ( see  4 ) .",
    "the lack of correlation between the velocity and the other property of pulsars has been one of the reasons that theoretical models of kicks are not well constrained .",
    "however , recent x - ray observation of compact nebulae around several young pulsars has provided evidence for spin - kick alignment ; these are summarized in  2.1 .",
    "another way of constraining the pulsar spin axis is through radio polarization profile (  2.2 ) .",
    "recent _ chandra _ observations of the pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) have provided evidence for spin - kick alignment for several pulsars ( e.g. , pavlov et al .",

    "the symmetric morphology of the nebula with respect to the jet direction strongly suggests that the jet is along the pulsar s spin axis .",

    "our analysis of the velocity - spin correlation for isolated pulsars (  2 ) shows that kick is aligned with spin axis for many ( but most likely not all ) pulsars ( see table 1 - 2 and fig .  1 ) .",
    "of particular interest is the fact that for pulsars with estimated initial spin periods ( when such estimate can be made ) less than @xmath418  ms , the kick is apparently aligned with the spin axis to within the error of measurements ( typically @xmath419 ; see table 1 ) . if we exclude psr j0538 + 281 ( for which @xmath420  ms ) , the initial spin periods of these pulsars are all less than @xmath421  ms . of course",
    ", we should add the usual caveat that a pulsar might have experienced a phase of rapid spindown before electromagnetic braking begins , so that the actual spin period of the proto - ns may be shorter than the estimated @xmath26 .",
    "on the other hand , our analysis of sn kicks in ns binaries based on the observed spin - orbital property of various ns binaries (  3 ) shows that in a number of systems , the kick must not be aligned with the spin axis of the _",
    "ns progenitor_. how can we reconcile this conclusion with the apparent spin - kick alignment for many isolated pulsars ?",
    "one possibility is that although the kick @xmath207 is misaligned with the spin axis ( denoted by @xmath269 in  3 ) of the he star , it may still be aligned with the spin axis of the ns , since the ns may get most of its angular momentum from off - centered kicks rather than from its he star progenitor ( spruit & phinney 1998 ; see also burrows et al .",
    ". however , in the absence of any `` primordial '' angular momentum from the progenitor , a kick ( of any duration ) displaced by a distance @xmath422 from the center , produces a spin of @xmath423  hz , with the spin axis necessarily perpendicular to the velocity direction .",
    "if the kick is the result of many thrusts on the proto - ns ( spruit & phinney 1998 ) , the relative direction of the net kick and spin depends on how the orientation of each thrust is correlated with each other .",
    "spin - kick alignment is possible in some circumstances , but is by no means a generic prediction of the `` multiple thrusts '' scenario .",
    "if the kick direction is not aligned with the he star spin ( as we show for many ns binaries in  3 ) , it will not be aligned with the ns spin in general , regardless of the origin of the ns spin .",
    "an important clue comes from the psr 0045 - 7319/b - star system : the kick imparted to the pulsar at its birth is misaligned with its spin axis , and the initial spin period has been constrained to be @xmath424  s ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "also , for psr 0737 - 3039 ( with pulsar b spin period @xmath425  s ) and many other ns / ns binaries , as well as for the psr j1141 - 6545/mwd system ( with @xmath426  s ) , the kick is misaligned with the spin axis . in addition , for the psr j1740 - 3053/ms ( with @xmath427  s ) system , the kick and spin may be misaligned .    combining these kick constraints obtained from ns binaries with the information we have about kicks in isolated pulsars , we are led to the following tentative suggestion : when the ns initial spin period is less than a few @xmath428  ms ,",
    "the kick will be aligned the the spin axis ; otherwise , the kick will in general not be aligned with the spin axis , except by chance .",
    "this suggestion , by no means definitive , is consistent with all the observational data on ns kicks in isolated pulsars and in ns binaries which have have analyzed / summarized in  2 and  3 .",
    "\\(i ) _ hydrodynamically driven kicks _ in which the sn explosion is asymmetric ( with the explosion stronger in one direction than the other directions ) , and the ns receives a kick according to momentum conservation .",
    "large - scale convections in the neutrino - heated mantle behind the stalled shock ( at @xmath429  km ) may naturally lead to such asymmetric explosion , particularly when the delay between core bounce and shock revival is sufficiently long to allow for small - scale convective eddies to merge into bigger ones ( scheck et al .",
    "2004 ; see also thompson 2000 ; blondin & mezzacappa 2005 ; foglizzo et al .",
    "sn asymmetric perturbations due to convective o - si burning ( bazan & arnett 1998 ) , amplified during core collapse ( lai & goldreich 2000 ) , may also play a role ( burrows & hayes 1996 ; goldreich et al .  1996 ; fryer 2004 ) .",
    "the kick timescale ranges from 10 s ms to 100 s ms .",
    "obviously , detailed calculations of this class of mechanisms are still uncertain  such a calculation / simulation is an integral part of the general problem of sn explosion mechanism .",
    "\\(ii ) _ magnetic - neutrino driven kicks _",
    "rely on asymmetric neutrino emission induced by strong magnetic fields .",
    "this could arise because the strong magnetic field modifies the neutrino opacities either through standard weak - interaction physics ( e.g. dorofeev et al .",
    "1985 ; lai & qian 1998 ; arras & lai 1999a , b ; duan & qian 2005 ) or through nonstandard physics ( e.g. , fuller et al .  2003",
    "; lambiase  2005 ) .",
    "it could also arise from the dynamical effect of the magnetic field on the proto - ns ( e.g. , the b field can affect the neutrino - driven convection / instabilities , and thus creating dark or hot neutrino spots ; duncan & thompson 1992 ; socrates et al .",
    "all these effects are important only when the magnetic field of the proto - ns is stronger than @xmath430  g. the kick timescales are of order the neutrino diffusion time , a few seconds .",
    "\\(iii ) _ electromagnetically driven kicks _ involve radiation from off - centered rotating dipole , which , for appropriate dipole orientation / displacement , imparts a gradual acceleration to the pulsar along its spin axis ( harrison & tademaru 1975 ; lai et al .",
    "this effect is important only if the ns initial period is @xmath431  ms .",
    "the kick time is of order the initial spin - down time ( @xmath432  s for @xmath433  g and @xmath434  ms ) .",
    "\\(iv ) other mechanisms are possible if the collapsing iron core has large angular momentum .",
    "for example , the combination of rapid rotation and magnetic field may lead to bipolar jets from the sn , and a slight asymmetry between the two jets will lead to a large kick ( e.g. khokhlov et al .  1999 ; akiyama et al .",
    "another mechanism could be that , if a rapidly rotating core fragments into a double proto - ns binary ( current numerical simulation indicates this is unlikely ; see fryer & warren 2003 ) , the explosion of the lighter proto - ns ( after mass transfer ) could give the remaining ns a kick ( colpi & wasserman 2002 ; see also davis et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "it is of interest to use observations to constrain or rule out some of these mechanisms .",
    "since the initial spin period of radio pulsars is @xmath435  ms , ( iii ) and ( iv ) appear unlikely in general .",
    "the observed dipole magnetic field of most radio pulsars lies in the range @xmath436  g , but it is not clear whether most proto - nss can have ( even transient ) magnetic fields stronger than @xmath437  g. so we can not easily rule out ( ii ) .",
    "regarding spin - kick alignment / misalignment , the crucial point is the ratio between the initial spin period @xmath26 and kick timescale @xmath438 . in hydrodynamically driven kicks ( i ) and magnetic - neutrino driven kicks ( ii )",
    ", the primary thrust to the ns does not depend on the ns spin axis .",
    "but the net kick will be affected by rotational averaging if @xmath26 is much less than @xmath439 .",
    "let @xmath440 be the kick velocity that the ns attains in the case of zero rotation , and @xmath441 be the angle between the primary asymmetry and the rotation axis .",
    "the expected components of kick along the rotation axis and perpendicular to it are ( for @xmath442 ) @xmath443 thus the angle @xmath83 between the kick vector @xmath444 and the spin axis is given by @xmath445 .",
    "typically , the spin - kick alignment will be achieved when @xmath446 .",
    "the observed spin - kick alignment for @xmath447 s ms discussed in  4.1 therefore suggests that @xmath438 lies between hundreds of ms to 1  s. such kick timescale is consistent with magnetic - neutrino driven mechanisms or hydrodynamical mechanisms with long - delayed sn explosions .    obviously , this conclusion is far from definitive .",
    "for example , since the primary thrust may be applied at a distance larger than the ns radius , a somewhat more stringent condition on @xmath26 is required to produce spin - kick alignment ( see lai et al .  2001 ) . in another word",
    ", the inequality @xmath448 is a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for spin - kick alignment . also ,",
    "an initial spin period of order @xmath449 s ms could be generated by the sn kick itself ( see above ) .",
    "we have argued ( see  4.1 ) that a kick - induced spin without `` primordial '' angular momentum ( i.e. from the progenitor ) would not in general give rise to spin - velocity alignment .",
    "the situation may be different with even a modest primordial spin .",

    "<S> we study observational constraints on neutron star ( ns ) kicks for isolated pulsars and for neutron stars in binary systems . </S>",
    "<S> we are particularly interested in the evidence of kick - spin alignment / misalignment and its dependence on the neutron star initial spin period . for several young pulsars , </S>",
    "<S> x - ray observations of compact nebulae showed that pulsar proper motion is aligned with the spin direction as defined by the symmetry axis of the nebula . </S>",
    "<S> we also critically examine the measurements of the proper motion and the projected spin axis from a large sample of pulsars with well - calibrated polarization data . </S>",
    "<S> we find that among the two dozen pulsars for which reliable measurements are available , there is a significant correlation between the spin axis and the proper motion . for various ns binaries , </S>",
    "<S> including double ns systems , binaries with massive main - sequence star companion and binaries with massive white - dwarf companion , we obtain constraints on the kick magnitudes and directions from the observed orbital characteristics of the system . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the kick velocity is misaligned with the the ns spin axis in a number of systems , and the ns spin period ( when available ) in these systems is generally longer than several hundreds milliseconds . </S>",
    "<S> these constraints , together with spin - kick alignment observed in many isolated pulsars , suggest that the kick timescale is hundreds of milliseconds to 1  s , so that spin - kick alignment or misalignment can be obtained depending on the initial spin period of the ns . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implication of our result for various ns kick mechanisms . </S>"
