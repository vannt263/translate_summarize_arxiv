    "the vertical coordinate system is adjusted in time following @xmath22 changes , to ensure an optimal spatial discretization , with primitives conserved following @xcite .",
    "the final extension is to allow the geoid plane br([geobrep ] ) to vary in time . in practice",
    "it is a computationally expensive process , and other approaches are more efficient in adjusting extent on the geoid plane , such as activating regions with wetting - and - drying procedures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "an arbitrary repositioning or change in node number within @xmath17 , with a subsequent extrusion through @xmath33 and @xmath34 , does not ensure a conservation of volume .",
    "a simple approach which permits refinement , is to begin with a coarse @xmath20 and associated @xmath17 , whose nodes remain in the discretization throughout a simulation , with extrusion bounds @xmath33 and @xmath34 for any refinements determined by linear interpolation . in this approach the representation of the surface boundary",
    "is selected at initialization and not refined during a simulation in order to conserve volume .",
    "the approach is realized in the implementation shingle , a software library which is written in python , a widely used high - level , interpreted programming language that has been designed to be highly extensible .",
    "python has a small core , with a large standard library and an easily extensible interpreter , making it easy to build up individual components in a hierarchy of automation ( [ tenet : automated ] ) .",

    "computationally demanding solutions can be cached to disk in a compact binary representation using the standard python pickle library .",
    "distribution and sharing of spatial discretization constraints for model intercomparisons , data provenance and a consistency between model setups is addressed in @xcite . since",
    "geophysical spatial discretizations can be reproduced in an automated deterministic way using the interpreter shingle , it is also sufficient and constraint - complete to depend on the self - consistent source data in a standardized format and processing record : of pre - processing operations applied using standard common geospatial tools , the brgeneration operation such as ( [ command ] ) and metric formulae with reference to the interpretors shingleand gmsh .",
