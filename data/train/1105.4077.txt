    "a plethora of cosmological and astrophysical measurements over the last decades has tested the validity of the standard model of big bang cosmology ( a spatially flat friedman  robertson  walker model ) at an unprecedented level of precision .",
    "current observations point to a flat universe in which the mass - energy content includes only 5  % of ordinary matter ( baryons ) while 22  % is a mysterious non - baryonic dark matter  ( dm ) component , whose properties are largely unknown . if it can be identified with some relic , this should be a massive , neutral and sufficiently long - lived particle .",
    "a popular hypothesis , realized in many extensions of the standard model of particle physics  ( sm ) , including supersymmetry  @xcite or extra dimensional models  @xcite , is that the dm is dominated by a single species of weakly interacting massive particle  ( wimp ) .",
    "such wimps could have masses ranging from several gev to dozens of tev , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "direct dm searches look for the recoil energy of target nuclei due to interactions with the dm particles .",
    "wimp scattering on nuclei may happen via spin - dependent interactions ( proportional to @xmath1 , rather than to the number of nucleons ) or via spin - independent scattering ( which grow with @xmath2 and therefore increase dramatically with the mass of the target nuclei ) .",
    "the spin - independent cross section dominates over spin - dependent scattering in current direct dm detection experiments , which use heavy atoms as targets , setting therefore very strong constraints on spin - independent interactions . for dm",
    "capture in the sun , however , the distinction is not so strong as in direct detection searches since a large fraction of the sun s mass is in the form of hydrogen , for which there is no enhancement of the spin - independent cross section . in the following",
    ", we will present our results in terms of spin - dependent dm scattering cross section .",
    "however , in practice , similar neutrino fluxes would be obtained with spin - independent cross section around two orders of magnitude smaller due to its enhancement for the heavier nuclei present in the sun ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "thus , all the results presented here for spin - dependent scattering cross sections can be roughly translated for the spin - independent case with an improvement of around two orders of magnitude .",
    "although there is no confirmed observation of the passage of wimps through a detector , a long standing positive signal in the form of an annual modulation has been reported by the dm search experiment dama / libra  @xcite .",
    "this annual modulation is expected in the scattering of dm particles off nuclei in the detector due to the earth s annual motion around the sun , that modifies the relative velocity of the earth and the dm halo .",
    "the dama / libra collaboration has reported the observation of 13 such cycles , compatible with the expected phase due to the earth s orbit , at @xmath3 .",
    "this observation is , however , not confirmed by other direct search experiments , such as xenon  @xcite and cdms  @xcite .",
    "tension between the two datasets remains even when interpreting the dama / libra results as scatterings of dm particles off the na nuclei , which would point to light dm masses @xmath4  gev with a spin - independent scattering cross section @xmath5  fb close to the threshold of the xenon and cdms sensitivities .",
    "on the other hand , the cogent experiment has also reported an observed excess of events over the expected background  @xcite . as in the dama / libra case ,",
    "the shape of the excess would also be consistent with scatterings of light dm @xmath4  gev , although with somewhat smaller spin - independent scattering cross section @xmath6  fb .",
    "the similarity of the dama / libra and cogent results is very intriguing , although there is some tension between the preferred value of the cross section and there is controversy on whether the two dm hints can be reconciled in the simple spin - independent elastic scattering picture , with analyses pointing to a combined allowed region around @xmath7  gev and @xmath5  fb  @xcite or disfavouring such an explanation  @xcite .",
    "even more tantalizing is the recent announcement of the cogent collaboration of an annual modulation , similar to the dama / libra one , in their observed excess at @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the cresst - ii experiment also observes an excess of 32 events to be compared with an expect background of @xmath9 in the o band  @xcite , corresponding to the lowest energies .",
    "when interpreted as a dm hint , these events could be accommodated with a mass and cross section in the same region as that favoured by dama / libra and cogent  @xcite . while the accumulation of hints favouring light dm with masses of @xmath4  gev and a spin - independent cross section @xmath10  fb is tantalizing , this region is disfavoured by the null results of the xenon and cdms searches .",
    "however , as this region is close to the energy threshold , these results are sometimes questioned since small changes in the energy calibration or efficiencies could indeed reopen the window required for the dm interpretation of dama / libra , cogent and cresst . on the other hand ,",
    "the xenon and cdms experiments have a cleaner signal region , given the stronger background suppression achieved .",
    "therefore , the dama and cogent excesses could be due to a misinterpreted background component .",
    "a very similar situation occurs when interpreting the dama / libra signal through a spin - dependent cross section in the pb range and the null results of the picasso  @xcite , coupp  @xcite and simple  @xcite searches .",
    "clearly , more experiments sensitive to these low dm mass regions are needed in order to settle the present tensions and shed light on the dm puzzle . in this context ,",
    "dm indirect detection methods offer a very attractive complementary probe .",
    "they aim to detect the gamma - ray , positron , anti - proton and neutrino fluxes produced in dm annihilations in regions with dense dm accumulations , such as the galactic center . in the case of neutrinos ,",
    "the higher densities of dm expected to be gravitationally trapped in celestial bodies , such as the sun  @xcite or the earth  @xcite offer a very appealing alternative since , contrary to positrons or gamma - rays , neutrinos can escape the solar interior providing a snapshot of the interaction taking place .",
    "these indirect searches , provide a very complementary tool to direct detection probes since , unlike them , they will not only provide a measurement of the dm mass and scattering cross section , but also information on the different annihilation branching ratios , depending on the particular channel searched for .",
    "bounds on the wimp mass and cross section from the water cerenkov ( wc ) neutrino detector super - kamiokande ( super - k ) have been obtained for different annihilation channels , see ref .",
    "a lot of effort has also been devoted to using neutrino telescopes to detect neutrinos from dm annihilation processes  @xcite . however , these neutrino telescopes are mostly sensitive to @xmath11 and @xmath12 events , and their energy threshold is @xmath13 gev in the muon energy ( which is translated into @xmath14  gev neutrino energy ) .",
    "other neutrino detectors might be necessary to test the dm mass region indicated by dama / libra and cogent via indirect searches . even if super - k is sensitive to low dm masses ,",
    "the energy resolution achieved by the former detector is not as good as for some future facilities .",
    "future neutrino detectors , such as wc , liquid argon ( lar ) , liquid scintillator , or magnetized iron neutrino detector ( mind ) facilities , might be constructed for other physics measurements ( such as neutrino oscillation studies or core collapse supernova neutrino physics ) and could be exploited for indirect dm detection .    as first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , future mind - like detectors currently under development , such as india - based neutrino observatory  ( ino ) , could provide an excellent energy and angular resolution to neutrinos from wimp annihilations in the sun .",
    "in such detectors , the expected degeneracies among the dm mass , annihilation branching ratios , and elastic cross section with nuclei could be resolved , shedding much light on the dm nature .",
    "other detection techniques originally proposed and constructed for long baseline and supernova neutrino studies have also been examined in this context , such as future lar detectors  @xcite as well as current and future liquid scintillator detectors  @xcite .    here",
    "we extend the work of ref .",
    "@xcite by considering both lower dm masses ( @xmath4  gev ) and additional annihilation channels to the @xmath15 and @xmath16 previously studied .",
    "we also consider not only future mind detectors , but also proposed future lar facilities , such as glacier .",
    "both techniques are expected to achieve unprecedented energy and angular reconstruction capabilities at @xmath17  gev neutrino energies .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : section  [ sec : detectors ] describes the mind and lar detector technologies exploited here .",

    "the physics potential of such large detectors is extremely broad .",
    "one of the major aims is the search for proton decay  @xcite , which provides a direct test of grand unified theories .",
    "these large neutrino detectors are also essential for the future accelerator based long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments to explore mixing and cp violation in the lepton sector  @xcite .",
    "applications in astrophysics include precise measurements of supernova neutrinos and the search for new sources of astrophysical neutrinos  @xcite . in this context",
    ", the possibility of observing the neutrinos originated from the annihilation of dm particles in the center of the sun  @xcite and to reconstruct the annihilation process so as to probe the nature of dm is particularly tantalizing and will be the main goal of our study .",
    "these detectors are expected to measure the energy and the direction of the initial neutrino with very high precision which allows to search for dm particles in the mass range of @xmath20  gev , which can not be probed effectively with large neutrino telescopes such as icecube  @xcite .",
    "currently , four different technologies for large underground neutrino detection are being investigated worldwide : wc , unsegmented liquid scintillator , lar time projection chamber ( lartpc ) , and mind .",
    "below we discuss in detail the lartpc and mind alternatives , which can provide the best performance for the searches under study .",
    "indeed , the energy and angular resolution capabilities of wc and liquid scintillator detectors degrade rapidly beyond the quasielastic regime and thus makes them unsuited for the multi - gev energies under consideration .",
    "the assumed characteristics of the detectors used in our numeric simulations are summarized in tab .",

    "[ fig:10measure ] we show the preferred regions of the parameter space in the case of simulated @xmath21  fb .",
    "as expected from the sensitivities , the mind detector is only capable of distinguishing @xmath22 from zero , while the signal for @xmath23 is close to being detectable . on the other hand",
    ", glacier would be able to clearly identify the nature of the dm branching ratios into both @xmath24s and @xmath25s , and being close to the sensitivity needed for detecting @xmath26 at this level .",

    "the solid lines show the glacier ( thick ) and 34  kt lartpc ( thin ) results , while the dotted lines show the mind results .",
    "the results correspond to 10  years of exposure for glacier , the 34  kt lartpc and mind.[fig:10measure ]    the reproduction of the parameters by glacier is remarkable and essentially free of correlations between the different branching ratios .",
    "there is a very small correlation between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , since both of these spectra are both softer than the @xmath31 one ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : fluxes ] ) , but this correlation is almost negligible .",
    "since the different branching ratios of dm could be singled out in an experiment like this , we would gain valuable information on the dm couplings to different particles , which in turn would be of large interest to constrain different models of dm .",
    "this would not be true in , _",
    "e.g. _ , direct detection experiments , which would only be sensitive to the total cross section on the target .",
    "it is important to remark that the discerning capability of the detectors between the different dm annihilation channels stems almost exclusively from their energy resolution and the ability to reconstruct the different spectral shapes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxes ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the capability of the mind detector to separate the neutrino and antineutrino samples does not help with this measurement since the corresponding antineutrino event shapes are extremely similar .",
    "similarly , the information on the neutrino flavour glacier provides is largely irrelevant for the analysis and its ability to detect @xmath32 in addition to @xmath11 only provides an increase in statistics but no complementary information to solve degeneracies .",
    "the slight degeneracy between @xmath22 and the other parameters , in particular for the 10  gev dm mass results for mind , is mainly due to the 10  % systematic error assumed for the atmospheric background simulation and the energy resolution and statistics not being sufficient to tell the spectral shape of the background from a combination of @xmath22 and @xmath33 .",
    "notice that this effect also worsens the sensitivity estimated for the mind detector , since relatively large values of @xmath22 and @xmath33 simultaneously can not be disentangled from a situation with a smaller atmospheric background accommodated within the 10  % systematic allowed .",
    "thus , the sensitivity limits derived here , in particular for the mind detector , are more conservative than the ones presented for super - k in ref .",
    "@xcite since only one branching ratio a time was considered there and in order for the signal to mimic the background a combination of both @xmath22 and a softer channel is necessary , as depicted by the degeneracy in the top left and top center panels of fig .",

    "in this paper we have studied the detection of neutrinos as a possible indirect signal of low mass ( 1025  gev ) dm annihilating in the sun at the next generation of neutrino detectors , as well as the determination of which annihilation channels are present .",
    "due to the results of the dama / libra , cogent and cresst collaborations , this mass range , which is unaccessible to neutrino telescopes due to the low neutrino energy , is of great interest .",
    "we have focused mainly on the lartpc and mind detector technologies .",
    "apart from having good energy and angular resolution capabilities , these two detector types are under consideration for several future neutrino experiments . for the lartpc",
    ", we consider both a 34  kt and a 100  kt version , corresponding to detectors proposed for the lbne and laguna projects , respectively , and for the mind we will consider a 100  kt detector , corresponding to the neutrino factory proposal or an upgraded version of ino .    for the signal rate , we computed the solar capture rate of dm following ref .",
    "@xcite and using the standard bp2000 solar model  @xcite .",
    "our results are presented in the variables @xmath34 ( @xmath28 ) , where @xmath35 is the annihilation branching ratio into @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the total spin - dependent dm - nucleon cross section .",
    "we have not included a systematic error on the signal , since this will mainly be an overall factor due to different capture mechanics and therefore lead to a simple rescaling of the @xmath38 parameters .",
    "the main background to our signal is atmospheric neutrinos , for which we assume a systematic overall normalization error of 10  % . in order to suppress this background , we use the fact that the detectors under study have the capability of measuring the energy and direction of the incoming neutrino and demand that this direction is within the detector angular resolution from the direction of the sun .",
    "our results show that with 10 years data the facilities under study would have a sensitivity to @xmath38 of @xmath39  fb ( c.f",
    ".  tab .",
    "[ tab : sensitivity ] ) with the best sensitivity being achieved for the 100  kt lartpc detector and the worst for the mind technology .",
    "this should be put into context by the current bounds from direct detection experiments , which give @xmath40  fb at 10  gev mass ( picasso  @xcite ) and @xmath41  fb at 25  gev ( coupp  @xcite ) and the region favoured by the dama / libra signal around 10  gev mass and @xmath42  pb . the latest results by simple  @xcite improve on these limits down to @xmath4  fb . the sensitivities to different annihilation channels are essentially independent without correlations among them . for",
    "comparison with current experiments , the mind detector would perform essentially on the level of the current super - k  @xcite data , although the analysis presented here is more conservative , allowing for degeneracies among the different channels and the atmospheric background that were not taken into account by the analysis of super - k data and for which they would be potentially more dangerous , since only a counting experiment with no energy information was assumed in the study . on the other hand , the 100  kt lartpc would out - perform super - k by almost two orders of magnitude . in general , the sensitivities are better for the @xmath43 channel and worse for the @xmath44 channel , due to the spectra being harder and softer , respectively , as well as a lower event rate per annihilation for the @xmath44 channel , and thus leading to different levels of confusion with the soft atmospheric spectrum .",
    "we have also simulated the results for a typical signal when @xmath21  fb for all @xmath45 . as expected from tab .",
    "[ tab : sensitivity ] , it would be challenging for all of the considered experiments to distinguish @xmath33 from zero , while the lartpc detectors would clearly measure @xmath22 and to some extent @xmath23 ( c.f .",
    "[ fig:10measure ] ) .",
    "we point out that the experiments considered have the remarkable ability to tell apart the different annihilation branching ratios exploiting their energy resolution , something impossible with a counting experiment such as the study performed for present super - k data .",
    "this demonstrates the complementarity of dm searches at neutrino detectors compared to other dm probes in the study of the nature of dm .",
    "we conclude that the prospects for improving the limits on low mass dm annihilations in the sun in future neutrino experiments are in general good . although current results for super - k rule out the dama and cogent signals with large branching ratios into channels giving rise to neutrinos , solutions with subdominant annihilation into these channels are still viable and present bounds can be improved by almost two orders of magnitude at a detector with the characteristics of glacier .",
    "furthermore , these future experiments would have some capabilities of measuring the actual branching ratio into different channels by using the shape of the energy spectrum and such a measurement would provide important information on the nature of the dm .",
