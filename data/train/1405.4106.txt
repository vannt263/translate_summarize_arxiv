    "cell membranes are composed of a mixture of different types of lipids including saturated and unsaturated phospholipids , cholesterol molecules , fatty acids , proteins and other inclusionsyeagle_structure_2005 .",
    "membrane properties and biological functions provided by cell membranes are ensured by tuned balance of membrane composition .",
    "when this balance is altered , the cell function can be modified and can even lead to certain diseases@xcite .",
    "many functional properties of lipid membranes are determined by collective phenomena , where many molecules interact with each other and self - assemble in complex arrangements with internal structure and order@xcite .",
    "in particular , a detailed microscopic description of collective phenomena in lipid bilayers may require the study of very large systems comprising of large number of lipid molecules , where atomistic molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations are not yet practical@xcite .",
    "thus , theoretical description of large lipid systems is usually limited to coarse - grained modelsmuller_coarse - grained_2003,muller_biological_2006,venturoli_mesoscopic_2006 , where groups of atoms are represented by effective beads , thus reducing number of degrees of freedom in simulated systems .",
    "it is usually accepted that the coarse - graining provides an adequate and consistent description of equilibrium and structural properties of lipid bilayers@xcite . since lipid molecules are rather short and their conformation space is limited ,",
    "the resulted equilibrium structures are determined by amphiphilic structure of molecule and thus the bilayer composition is not sensitive to details of coarse - graining@xcite",
    ".    combination of coarse - grained molecular models with mean field theories is the next step towards description of even larger lipid systems .",
    "the mechanical and structural properties of lipid bilayers can be successfully modeled within the single chain mean field ( scmf ) theorypogodin_coarse - grained_2010 .",
    "the scmf theory was originally proposedben - shaul_chain_1985,szleifer_chain_1985,ben - shaul_chain_1986 to describe the self - assembly of surfactants into spherical micellesben - shaul_chain_1985,ben - shaul_chain_1986,al - anber_prediction_2005,gezae_daful_accurate_2011 .",
    "computationally expensive calculation of interactions between molecules is replaced by calculation of interactions of a single molecule in different conformations with a mean field , created by other molecules . in this",
    "approach correlations between molecules and fluctuations are neglected , while the output of the theory is equilibrium structures .",
    "this theory gives detailed molecular structure of nanoscale objects self - assembled from relatively short molecules .",
    "since scmf theory describes the systems in equilibrium , the free energy of different self - assembled structures can be obtained directlyben - shaul_chain_1985,szleifer_chain_1985,ben - shaul_chain_1986 , easier than in molecular dynamics ( md ) and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "in addition , modifications of this theory , for example , single chain in mean field simulations@xcite , can describe long - wavelength fluctuations .",
    "in this work we propose a general coarse - grained model for the scmf theory of most common lipids@xcite found in nature that have the same polar head and differ only in the length of their aliphatic tails .",
    "this model is similar in spirit to 10-beads model described in ref . , but is more accurate in description of equilibrium properties of the bilayers and can be applied to a wider range of lipids . to test the performance of our model we compare the free energy of compressed bilayers with md simulation results@xcite obtained within martini model",
    "scmf theory of lipid bilayers@xcite describes lipid molecules in a coarse - grained approximation as a group of connected beads interacting via effective pairwise potentials .",
    "each bead represents several atoms while the number of atoms in the bead depends on the level of coarse - graining .",
    "in contrast to widely used self - consistent field ( scf)@xcite theories , there is no _ a priori _ assumption on the probability distribution of conformations of molecules ; instead , representative sampling@xcite of conformations is generated using monte carlo or rosenbluth methods@xcite .",
    "thus , this method provides more adequate description for short molecules which have non - gaussian probability distribution of conformations , which is the case for lipids .",
    "explicit generation of the sampling allows to split the interactions of the molecules into intra- and intermolecular parts .",
    "intra - molecular interactions can be calculated explicitly for each conformation during the generation of the sampling , while intermolecular interactions are replaced by interactions of each conformation with mean - fields created by other molecules or external fields .",
    "thus , the probability of each conformation @xmath0 is fixed by a given distribution of mean fields , while the mean fields are calculated as averages over all conformations with their probabilities , hence closing the self - consistency loop .",
    "such strategy allows to write a set of self - consistent non - linear algebraical equations , which can be solved numerically .",
    "scmf method applied to lipid bilayers is summarized in ref .",
    ", here we list the resulting expressions .",
    "the probability of each conformation @xmath0 , @xmath1 normalized by the normalization constant @xmath2 , is given by the effective hamiltonian , @xmath3 , which is determined by distributions of the mean fields@xcite , @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the number of molecules in the system ; @xmath6 is the contribution from intra - molecular interactions of a particular conformation @xmath0 ; @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the contributions of each conformation to the fields of interactions of two types of beads , tails ( t ) , heads ( h ) , solvent molecules ( s ) , and excluded volume , in a particular point in space @xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding mean fields created by the molecules are the averages over all conformations with the corresponding probability @xmath12 are denoted by angular brackets .",
    "hence , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the volume of the solvent bead and @xmath15 is the maximum volume fraction , allowed in the system@xcite .",
    "these equations are accompanied by the incompressibility condition ,    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is related to lateral pressure inside the bilayer .",
    "the interactions between the beads of lipids and the solvent are described by potential square well , which includes hard - core repulsion at the distances smaller than the sum of radii of the interacting beads and attraction or repulsion within the interaction range .",
    "this repulsion between the beads of different molecules is determined by the excluded volume field .",
    "these nonlinear equations give distributions of lipids and solvent molecules at equilibrium and the corresponding total free energy of the system .",
    "in addition to the global minimum of the system , the solution of equations may also lead to metastable solutions with higher free energy , which may , in principle , inform on possible metastable states as well as the transition path between stable states .",
    "phospholipid molecules are modeled as a sequence of beads of two types , heads ( h ) and tails ( t ) , as shown in figure [ fig : saturated ] .",
    "all studied lipid molecules have the phosphatidylcholine head which is represented by two h - beads of radius equal to 3.3 @xmath18 ( figure [ fig : saturated]a ) , which are the same for all studied lipids .",
    "the saturated lipids differ only in length of the tails of aliphatic chains ( figure [ fig : saturated]-a ) .",
    "thus , the coarse grained model represents the tails of lipids with hydrophobic t - beads of radius 2.5 @xmath18 , effectively grouping two or four carbon atoms according to the following rules : ( i ) the first t - bead , connected to the head , represents one carboxylate and one carbon group ; ( ii ) next non - terminal t - beads represent four carbon groups ; ( iii ) the terminal t - bead of the tail represents two or four carbon groups , depending on the length of the terminal bond ( 4.5 @xmath18 or 7.5 @xmath18 , correspondingly ) .",
    "the length of the rest of bonds is 7.5 @xmath18 , and there is no restrictions on the angles between them , _",
    "i.e. _ the beads are freely jointed .",
    "the molecules are generated by self - avoiding walk using rosenbluth algorithm , i.e. the beads in the resulting conformations do not intersect .",
    "the solvent molecules are represented by s - beads of radius 2.5 @xmath18 .",
    "the parameters of the model are summarized in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "two types of beads tails ( t ) and heads ( h ) and solvent ( s ) interact through square well potentials : the interaction is equal to zero if the distance between the center of bead is larger than the interaction range , while if the centers of beads are within the interaction range , the interaction between the beads has a constant value listed in the table .",
    "there are only two types of interactions : between two hydrophobic beads tt and between one hydrophilic bead and solvent hs .",
    "since the molecules are modeled as sequence of hard spheres , close packing is achieved for occupied volume fraction @xmath15 smaller than 1 , which is , in fact , a parameter of the system controlling the excluded volume interactions . in the model",
    "it is set to @xmath19 .",
    "the parameters of the model are adjusted through series of simulations with large sampling @xmath20 and resolution .",
    "the simulation box ( width @xmath21 length @xmath21 height ) is set to @xmath22 @xmath18 @xmath23 @xmath18 @xmath24 @xmath18 and the periodic boundary conditions in lateral directions are used .",

    "( i ) one of the tails of popc is shorter than the other ; ( ii ) popc molecule has one and dopc molecule has two double - bonds in the middle of the fatty acid tails .",
    "therefore , tails of popc have different lengths , but tails of dopc are of the same length . as a result , in our model ( figure  [ fig : saturated]-b , c ) the lipid tail with no double bond in popc has the same structure as the tails of dppc , while the tail with hydrogen bond in popc and both tails of dopc have similar structure as dspc . in addition , the bead in the middle of the tail corresponding to double bound has a fixed angle of @xmath25 degrees .        the implementation of fixed angle is illustrated in figure  [ fig : angle ] .",
    "a rotated coordinate system @xmath26 ( red ) centering on the unsaturated bead @xmath27 is defined with respect to a fixed coordinate system @xmath28 , where @xmath29-axis is oriented along the extended line of the bond connecting bead @xmath27 with the bead @xmath30 .",

    "the statistical error of scmf calculations is of the order of 1% for thickness and area and 5.4% for compressibility constant since it is a second derivative of the free energy and thus it requires large sampling to achieve a high accuracy .",
    "the thickness of the bilayers and the hydrophobic core thickness and the distance between heads increase linearly with the length of the tails , which corresponds to the increased molecular volume of the lipids .",
    "the compressibility constant and area per lipid decrease with the length of the tails .",
    "this is attributed to the increase of the tt contact energy per lipid with increased number of t beads .",
    "to analyze such behavior , we use one of the advantages of the scmf theory , namely the direct access to components of the total free energy at equilibrium .",

    "other terms to the free energy , the intra - molecular internal energy and the energy of head - solvent interactions are small and almost constant , thus not shown .",
    "main contribution to the free energy per lipid is the energy of tt contacts , which increases with the number of t beads in the tails , making the lipid more hydrophobic and thus leading to closer packing in the bilayer core region .",
    "the average volume fraction profile of the equilibrium lipid bilayer is shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "it shows the total volume fraction in the bilayer as well as the distribution of heads and tails in the bilayer for three saturated lipids . increased length of the tail leads to the increase of the thickness and increase of the head - to - head distance as reflected in table [ tab:2 ] .          our model of unsaturated dopc and popc lipids",
    "is based on the structure of saturated dppc or dspc lipids which have similar tail length and molecular volume , figure [ fig : saturated ] .",
    "the only difference between saturated and unsaturated lipids is the hydrogen bonds in the middle of the tails .",
    "one possibility is to model double bounds in the tails is to fix the angle as shown in figure [ fig : angle ] and keep all other parameters of saturated lipids model shown in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "such model with no fitting or additional parameters gives reasonable estimates for the structure of the bilayer , thickness of the membrane and hydrophobic core , molecular volume and gives reasonable compressibility constant ( red circles in figure [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "however , the resulting area per lipid is significantly lower experimental values .",
    "this can be explained by underestimated crowding effect induced by disordered packing of tails with fixed angles . but",
    "this packing effect relies on strong correlations between neighboring lipid tails and this effect definitely goes beyond mean field and hence is not present in scmf theory .",
    "in addition , these tails with fixed angle in the middle of the tail is difficult to align in parallel arrays , thus , impeding unsaturated lipids from phase transition to gel phase , observed for saturated lipids of the same structure and same temperature .     in a logarithmic scale .",
    "solid and open squares denote experimental and simulation data by @xcite@xcite , solid triangles are experimental data by @xcite@xcite , solid stars are our simulation results with scmf model.,width=321 ]    fixed angle induces the distortion in the conformations of lipids which results in slightly increased average excluded volume of conformations . according to our numerical estimations based on averaging of the excluded volume of each generated conformation , the increase of the excluded volume is about 5.1% for dopc and 2.6% for popc .",
    "this effect was indirectly incorporated into the model of unsaturated lipid by increasing the volume of the beads by this amount .",
    "this increase of the volume of the beads has led to significantly better correspondence with experimental results as shown in figure [ fig:2 ] and table [ tab:2 ] .",
    "the consequences on the lipid bilayer structure induced by the replacement of dspc by dopc lipid is depicted in figure [ fig:5 ] .",
    "the thickness of the bilayer of unsaturated lipid is lower than that of saturated lipid because the number of lipids in the equilibrium is smaller .",
    "general model for saturated phospholipids is shown to be successful in description of equilibrium thermodynamic properties of single unconstrained bilayers . in order to test this model",
    "further , we consider compressed bilayers .",
    "double bilayer systems can be formed in two distinct experimental situations : ( i ) dehydration of the water layer between the bilayers , when the distance between the bilayers is controlled by hydration level ( the number of water molecules per lipid)@xcite and ( ii ) mechanical compression of two bilayers@xcite , for example , squeezed between two parallel walls ; in this case the control parameter is the distance between the centers of mass of the bilayers .",
    "we choose two popc lipid bilayers placed between non - interacting walls in order to compare with the existing experiment and simulation data .",
    "the height of the box is decreased and the number of lipids in the box is adjusted to find the minimum of the free energy . the number of lipids corresponding to the minimum of the free energy is then corresponds to equilibrium area per lipid .",
    "this is similar in spirit to simulations in grand canonical ensemble , while mechanical and thermodynamic properties of the bilayers are calculated the same way as discussed in previous section .",
    "figure [ fig:6 ] shows a typical volume fraction profile of two compressed bilayers .",
    "in addition , another important property of the bilayer can be calculated , the disjoining pressure at a certain water layer thickness @xmath54 which is given by@xcite @xmath55where @xmath56 is the distance between the centers of the bilayers , @xmath57 is the compressibility modulus@xcite and @xmath58 is the area per lipid of a unperturbed popc bilayer at equilibrium . in turn , @xmath59 denotes the thickness of single        bilayer.@xcite it is equal to the distance between heads of single bilayer at equilibrium , @xmath60 . since our method can directly measure both @xmath60 and @xmath54 , they are directly obtained from the volume fraction profile as will be mentioned later .",

    "<S> coarse - grained model for saturated ( dcpc , dlpc , dmpc , dppc , dspc ) and unsaturated ( popc , dopc ) phospholipids is introduced within the single chain mean field theory . a single set of parameters adjusted for dmpc bilayers gives an adequate description of equilibrium and mechanical properties of a range of saturated lipid molecules that differ only in length of their hydrophobic tails and unsaturated ( popc , dopc ) phospholipids which have double bonds in the tails . </S>",
    "<S> a double bond is modeled with a fixed angle of 120 degrees , while the rest of the parameters are kept the same as saturated lipids . </S>",
    "<S> the thickness of the bilayer and its hydrophobic core , the compressibility and the equilibrium area per lipid correspond to experimentally measured values for each lipid , changing linearly with the length of the tail . </S>",
    "<S> the model for unsaturated phospholipids also fetches main thermodynamical properties of the bilayers . </S>",
    "<S> this model is used for an accurate estimation of the free energies of the compressed or stretched bilayers in stacks or multilayers and gives reasonable estimates for free energies . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed model may further be used for studies of mixtures of lipids , small molecule inclusions , interactions of bilayers with embedded proteins . </S>"
