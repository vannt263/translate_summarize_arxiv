    "relations between the parameters of this effective model and the physical quantities higgs mass and temperature are derived in @xcite .",
    "the interface tension @xmath4 characterises the strength of a first order phase transition .",
    "we apply the tunnelling correlation method @xcite to determine its value for a higgs mass of about @xmath5  gev by studying the inverse correlation length @xmath6 ( given by the correlation function of the higgs operator @xmath7 along @xmath8 ) in an elongated lattice @xmath9 as function of the transverse area @xmath10 .",
    "the scaling of @xmath11 at the critical point is predicted for a @xmath12-model as @xmath13 with @xmath14  @xcite by considering quadratic fluctuations around the kink solution in a semiclassical expansion .",
    "the power of @xmath15 in the scaling law for @xmath11 is eventually modified in higher orders .",
    "more general fits according to @xmath16 give the @xmath0 interface tension @xmath17 ( using @xmath18 for @xmath0 units ) at @xmath19  gev .    as a check for the applicability of this method we have repeated the simulation for @xmath20  gev and obtained @xmath21 in agreement with @xcite .",

    "[ fig : surf ] collects published results for the interface tension ( scaled by critical temperature ) @xmath22 of the @xmath1higgs model . in order to make this useful we had to recalculate the @xmath0 results to @xmath23 conventions ( adjusting to a renormalised gauge coupling 0.58 characteristic for the @xmath23 lattice data ) .",
    "this comparison further supports the validity of dimensional reduction .",
    "knowledge of the mass spectrum of screening states in the symmetric phase is important to describe the high @xmath24 phase by non - perturbative analytic models .",
    "the wave functions may characterise the change between the phases .",
    "first studies have been reported recently @xcite .    to study ground state _ and _ excited states ( and possibly wave functions ) one has to use cross - correlations between operators @xmath25 from a complete set in a given @xmath26 channel . in the transfer matrix formalism",
    "they describe the spectral decomposition ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 being the zero momentum energy eigenstates ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the connected correlation matrix for distance @xmath31 in one of the spatial directions .    on the lattice",
    "one can use only a truncated set of operators @xmath32 which is assumed to allow the extraction of the lowest lying states by considering the eigenvalue problem for @xmath33 . solving instead the generalised eigenvalue problem @xmath34 errors related to this truncation",

    "the wavefunction of state @xmath36 in the given operator basis is found ( at fixed small distance @xmath37 ) to be @xmath38 the components characterise the contribution of the original lattice operators to the ( ground or excited ) state in the @xmath26 channel . using operators of different transverse extension ( eventually only a subset of a used operator set with fixed quantum numbers ) one can derive their relative contribution to an optimised wavefunction .",

    "the following notation is used ( @xmath49 counts the string length in lattice units ) @xmath50    as an example we show the squared wavefunction for ground state and first excitation in the @xmath45-channel in the high temperature phase near to the transition as function of the operator length @xmath49 for a @xmath51 lattice .",
