    "recently , there is a growing interest in the study of 2d gapped dirac materials isoestructural with graphene .",
    "one of these materials is silicene , which is a two dimensional crystal of silicon , with a relevant intrinsic spin - orbit coupling ( as compared to graphene ) , studied theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "other gapped dirac materials are germanene , stannene and pb @xcite . for these systems , the low energy electronic properties can be described by a dirac hamiltonian , like in graphene , but the electrons are massive due to the relative large spin - orbit coupling @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , we will consider the application of a perpendicular electric field @xmath1",
    "( @xmath2 is the inter - lattice distance of the buckled honeycomb structure ) to the material sheet , which generates a tunable band gap @xmath3 ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote spin and valley , respectively ) .",
    "there is a topological phase transition @xcite from a topological insulator ( ti , @xmath6 ) to a band insulator ( bi , @xmath7 ) , at a charge neutrality point ( cnp ) @xmath8 , where there is a gap cancellation between the perpendicular electric field and the spin - orbit coupling , thus exhibiting a semimetal behavior .",
    "a 2d topological insulator was theoretically studied in @xcite and first discovered experimentally in hgte quantum wells in @xcite .",
    "a ti - bi transition is characterized by a band inversion with a level crossing at some critical value of a control parameter ( electric field , quantum well thickness , etc ) .",
    "recently , we have found that electron - hole wehrl entropies of a quantum state in a coherent - state representation provide a useful tool to identify ti - bi phase transitions @xcite .    in this work",
    "we explore the connection between the ti - bi transitions in some 2d dirac materials with the shannon information entropies of the wave packet probability densities in position and momentum spaces and , in particular , with the entropic uncertainty relation .",
    "the uncertainty principle can be quantified in terms of the usual variance - based uncertainty relation , @xmath9 , or alternatively by means of the entropic uncertainty relation @xcite which has been shown to be more appropriate in different physical situations @xcite .",
    "if we define the position and momentum densities of a state @xmath10 as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , with @xmath13 the position and @xmath14 the momentum wave packets , the entropic uncertainty relation is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the dimension of the position and momentum space and where @xmath17 is the so called shannon information entropy of a density @xmath18 .",
    "the equality is reached when the wave packets in position and momentum spaces are gaussians .",
    "the shannon information entropy measures the uncertainty in the localization of the wave packet in position or momentum spaces , so that the higher the shannon entropy is , the smaller the localization of the wave packet is ; and the smaller the entropy is , the more concentrated the wave function is . besides we will consider the relative or kullback - leibler entropy to characterize the topological - band insulator transitions ( see section [ klsection ] ) in these materials .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "firstly , in section [ hamilsec ] , we shall introduce the low energy hamiltonian for some 2d dirac materials ( namely : silicene , germanene , stantene , ... ) .",
    "then , in section [ entropysec ] , we will characterize topological - band insulator transitions in silicene in terms of the entropic uncertainty relation . in section [ klsection ] ,",
    "the connection between the relative entropy and the topological - band insulator transitions is studied . in section [ numsec ]",
    "we use the heisenberg uncertainty relation to characterize the ti - bi phase transition .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks will be given in the last section .",
    "let us consider a monolayer silicene film with external magnetic @xmath19 and electric @xmath20 fields applied perpendicular to the silicene plane .",
    "the low energy effective hamiltonian in the vicinity of the dirac point is given by @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath5 corresponds to the inequivalent corners @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) of the brillouin zone , respectively , @xmath26 are the usual pauli matrices , @xmath27 is the fermi velocity of the dirac fermions ( see table [ tabla ] for theoretical estimations in si , ge and sn ) , spin up and down values are represented by @xmath28 , respectively , and @xmath29 is the band gap induced by intrinsic spin - orbit interaction , which provides a mass to the dirac fermions .",
    "we are considering the application of a constant electric field @xmath20 which creates a potential difference @xmath30 between sub - lattices .",
    "the value @xmath2 appears in table [ tabla ] for different materials .",
    "the values of the spin - orbit energy gap induced by the intrinsic spin - orbit coupling has been theoretically estimated @xcite for different 2d dirac materials that we show in table [ tabla ] .",

    "these data have been obtain from first - principles computations in @xcite ( @xmath31 and @xmath2 ) and @xcite ( @xmath27 ) . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the eigenvalue problem can be easily solved . using the landau gauge , @xmath32 , the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the @xmath33 and",

    "we will do all the numerical analysis in silicene but the results will be valid just replacing the corresponding parameters in table [ tabla ] .    as already stated , there is a prediction ( see e.g. @xcite ) that when the gap @xmath45 vanishes at the cnp @xmath46 , silicene undergoes a phase transition from a topological insulator ( ti , @xmath6 ) to a band insulator ( bi , @xmath7 ) .",
    "this topological phase transition entails an energy band inversion .",
    "indeed , in figure [ energias ] we show the low energy spectra [ especteq ] as a function of the external electric potential @xmath47 for @xmath48 t. one can see that there is a band inversion for the @xmath49 landau level ( either for spin up and down ) at both valleys .",
    "the energies @xmath50 and @xmath51 have the same sign in the bi phase and different sign in the ti phase , thus distinguishing both regimes .",
    "we will observe a similar `` inversion '' behavior in entropic and variance - based uncertainty relations for the hamiltonian eigenstates [ vectors ] , thus providing a quantum - information characterization of the topological phase transition .",
