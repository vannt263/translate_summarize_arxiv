    "it is a common feature of several euclidean field theories of physical interest that spatially inhomogeneous , i.e. nonconstant field configurations have a lower value of the action functional than homogeneous ones .",
    "this means that , at least semiclassically , the inhomogeneous configurations are likely to dominate the functional integral and thus to determine the quantum vacuum state @xmath3 . in this case",
    "we expect that the essential features of the true vacuum state can be understood by an expansion in the quantum fluctuations about a set of configurations with a position - dependent , non - translational invariant value of the field variable . in the quantum vacuum",
    "this `` condensation '' of spatially inhomogeneous modes contributes to certain expectation values @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a scalar operator constructed from the derivatives of the fundamental fields in such a way that it is sensitive to the nonvanishing kinetic energy of the contributing configurations .",
    "( for instance , in a scalar model , @xmath6 . ) we shall generically refer to such contributions as `` kinetic condensates '' .",
    "they are to be distinguished from the familiar translational invariant `` potential condensates '' characterizing the conventional higgs mechanism which is triggered by a nonzero but constant scalar field expectation value .    in this context",
    "one should distinguish two different physical situations .",
    "if the degenerate minimum of the effective action corresponds to configurations which are not invariant under some global symmetry like translations or rotations such a symmetry is spontaneously broken and only the remaining unbroken symmetry can be used for a classification of the spectrum of excitations .",
    "this spectrum will typically contain massless `` goldstone - excitations '' . in this case one",
    "typically has an order parameter whose expectation value breaks the symmetry , in addition to the invariant kinetic operators mentioned above . in the second case",
    "the dominant configurations break a local symmetry .",
    "then it is well known that there is no true spontaneous symmetry breaking and no nonzero expectation value of a noninvariant order operator exists .",
    "also the `` goldstone - excitations '' are absent from the physical spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , we have learned from the higgs - mechanism in the electroweak standard model that a language in terms of `` spontaneous symmetry breaking '' can be very useful .",
    "this spontaneous symmetry breaking manifests itself in nonperturbative contributions to invariant operators for `` kinetic condensates '' .",
    "a typical example of a kinetic condensate is the gluon condensate in qcd .",
    "while the classical yang - mills action @xmath7 is minimized by @xmath8 , already the one - loop effective action assumes its minimum for @xmath9 .",
    "the savvidy vacuum @xcite tries to model the true ground state as a covariantly constant color magnetic field .",
    "the effective action of this state is indeed lower than that for @xmath8 .",
    "it is known , however , that the savvidy vacuum is unstable in the infrared ( ir ) , and it has been speculated that the dominant configurations may be spatially inhomogeneous ( perhaps domain - like ) in order to provide an ir cutoff at a scale set by @xmath10 .",
    "those nontrivial properties of the qcd vacuum are parametrized receive also perturbative contributions which are not related to `` kinetic condensates '' .",
    "we do not discuss here the difficult problem how they can be separated from `` kinetic condensates '' .",
    "] by @xmath11 and similar condensates of more complicated gauge- and lorentz - invariant operators .",

    "in fact , decomposing the metric as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a fixed reference metric , we obtain @xmath15=-\\frac{1}{16\\pi g}\\int d^4x\\,\\sqrt{\\bar{g } } \\,e^{2\\phi}\\,\\left[\\bar{r}+6\\,\\bar{g}^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\bar{d}_\\mu\\phi\\,\\bar{d}_\\nu \\phi\\right]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this shows that @xmath16 can become arbitrarily negative if the conformal factor @xmath17 varies rapidly enough so that @xmath18 is large . leaving aside for a moment the well known problems in setting up a consistent theory of quantum gravity , it is tempting to speculate that the theory cures this instability caused by the unboundedness of @xmath16 in a dynamical way .",
    "nonconstant @xmath19-modes could condense in such a way that the resulting quantum vacuum state is stable and constitutes the absolute minimum of some yet unknown _ effective _ action functional .",
    "the expectation value of the metric in this state should be close to the metric for flat space ( which is not the minimum of @xmath16 ! ) .",
    "also , operators like @xmath18 , appropriately covariantized , should acquire nonzero expectation values .",
    "this would indicate that the true vacuum arises from a `` dynamical stabilization '' of the bare theory due to the condensation of nonconstant @xmath19-modes .",
    "a further model in which the existence of a variant of the `` kinetic condensate '' has been speculated about is liouville field theory @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the expectation value of its operatorial equation of motion reads @xmath20 provided it is possible to make the operator @xmath21 well defined and that the regularized operator is still positive definite , @xmath22 implies that @xmath23 is nonzero and , as a consequence , that the vacuum @xmath3 is not translational invariant .    in the examples mentioned above the determination of the vacuum state",
    "is a formidable task which has not been mastered yet . in the present paper",
    "we shall therefore study the formation of a `` kinetic condensate '' within the framework of a scalar toy model .",
    "on the one hand , this model is simple enough to be treated analytically , on the other hand it is found to have the feature of a `` dynamical stabilization '' which we hope to occur in qcd and in quantum gravity .",
    "the model is formulated in @xmath1 euclidean dimensions .",
    "it contains a massless complex scalar field @xmath24 with a conventional @xmath25-self interaction but with a higher - derivative kinetic term : @xmath26 = \\int d^dx\\,\\left\\{\\chi^*\\,\\omega(-\\box)\\,\\chi + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\,|\\chi|^4\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the kinetic operator @xmath27 is taken to be @xmath28 so that in momentum space @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a constant with the dimension of a mass . on a euclidean spacetime where @xmath31 , the kinetic operator is positive for @xmath32 but negative for momenta between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "it has a minimum at @xmath35 where it assumes the value @xmath36 , see fig .",
    "the action ( [ a1 ] ) has a global u(1)-invariance under phase rotations @xmath37 with a constant @xmath38 , and it is invariant under the euclidean poincar group iso(@xmath1 ) of rigid spacetime translations and rotations .",
    "we will see that in this model the rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken whereas a modified translation symmetry is preserved . as a classical statistical system in @xmath39 dimensions or the ( zero temperature ) ground state of a quantum statistical system ( @xmath40 )",
    "this models the spontaneous formation of two - dimensional layers which break the rotation symmetry .",
    "an effective translation symmetry rotates the phase factor of the complex field @xmath19 by @xmath41 as one translates from one layer to the next . in two dimensions it corresponds to the spontaneous generation of line - like structures .",
    "we emphasize that the microscopic action has rotation and translation symmetry , in contrast to lattice models .",
    "our model therefore describes situations where already a tiny perturbation of these symmetries results in nontrivial geometric structures .",
    "the model shares some essential features with the conformal sector of a gravitational model of the type @xmath42=\\int d^dx\\,\\sqrt{g}\\{\\alpha\\,r+\\beta\\,r^2\\}$ ] , for instance .",
    "( here `` @xmath43 '' stands for any invariant quadratic in the riemann tensor . ) the euclidean classical action of this model is bounded below , in contrast to the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "it is therefore a good starting point for the definition of a euclidean functional integral if the problems of uv regularization can be mastered .",
    "the einstein - hilbert term @xmath44 leads to a negative contribution to the kinetic term of the conformal factor of the metric , which dominates at small momenta , while the @xmath43-term gives rise to a positive contribution dominating at large momenta .",
    "the instability at small and the stability at large momenta is modelled by the ansatz ( [ a4 ] ) with @xmath30 playing the role of the planck mass .",
    "the `` wrong sign '' @xmath45-term in ( [ a4 ] ) induces an instability of the naive vacuum with @xmath46 towards the formation of a spatially inhomogeneous ground state because the system tends to lower its euclidean action by making the kinetic action @xmath47 as negative as possible .",
    "thus we expect that the vacuum of this model is dominated by nonconstant field configurations whose typical momenta are of the order of the scale @xmath30 .",
    "we shall see that this is actually the case .",
    "the true vacuum configuration @xmath48 of any theory can be found from its ( standard ) effective action @xmath49 $ ] by solving the `` dressed '' field equation @xmath50 . in this paper",
    "we consider @xmath51 as the zero - cutoff limit of the effective average action @xmath52 $ ] , a type of coarse grained free energy with a variable infrared ( ir ) cutoff at the mass scale @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "it satisfies an exact renormalization group equation , and it interpolates between the classical action @xmath54 and the standard effective action @xmath55 . for our model",
    "we shall determine the renormalization group trajectory @xmath56 in the leading order of the semiclassical expansion which , as we shall argue , provides a qualitatively correct picture already .",
    "the functional @xmath52 $ ] has the same u(1 ) and iso(@xmath1 ) symmetry as the classical action .",
    "in particular , the bilinear term of @xmath57 has the same structure as the one in @xmath58 but @xmath59 is replaced by the dressed inverse propagator @xmath60 . in fig .",
    "[ f13 ] we have plotted our result for @xmath61 . quite remarkably , due to the renormalization effects , the kinetic term has become positive semidefinite even for a vanishing `` background field '' @xmath19 .",
    "for all modes with @xmath62 it `` costs '' energy ( action ) to excite them . by including renormalization effects these modes",
    "have been stabilized in a dynamical way . on the other hand ,",
    "modes with @xmath35 can be excited `` for free '' .",
    "this indicates that those modes might be unstable towards the formation of a condensate .",
    "to    we shall analyze this phenomenon in terms of a family of generalized momentum dependent effective potentials @xmath63 which are obtained by evaluating @xmath52 $ ] for plane - wave arguments @xmath64 .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath65 and @xmath62 all @xmath66 s have their minimum at @xmath67 so that the corresponding modes do not acquire a vacuum expectation value .",
    "for @xmath35 the situation is different : in the limit @xmath65 the potential @xmath68 develops a flat bottom which signals a nonzero expectation value , i.e. a condensation of the plane - wave modes with momenta @xmath69 . here",
    "@xmath70 is an arbitrary unit vector .",
    "indeed , for small but nonzero @xmath53 the absolute minimum of @xmath71 occurs ( within our approximation ) for @xmath72 in the mode @xmath35 .    in leading order",
    "we find the following expectation value of the fundamental field : @xmath73 it is characterized by the phase @xmath74 and the vector @xmath70 .",
    "this means that the above expectation value leads to a spontaneous breaking of both the u(1 ) and the iso(@xmath1 ) symmetry .",
    "for the translations in the directions @xmath70 only a remaining symmetry corresponding to combined transformations of the form @xmath75 is left unbroken , where @xmath76 represents a real , constant parameter . for such combined transformations the symmetry breaking from the spacetime translations",
    "is compensated by an appropriate phase rotation so that @xmath77 . the case @xmath78 , @xmath79 integer , is special in the sense that no compensating phase rotation is needed to achieve invariance",
    ". therefore we obtain a symmetry with respect to discrete spacetime translations given by @xmath80 as was already mentioned above the spontaneous breaking of the iso(@xmath1 ) symmetry to this discrete symmetry is analogous to the spontaneous formation of layers in statistical systems where the transformation ( [ w5 ] ) describes a translation from one layer to another .",
    "we emphasize that the layer structure involves the internal degrees of freedom whereas u(1 ) invariant operators have translationally invariant expectation values due to the combined effective translation symmetry .    by analyzing the spectrum of small fluctuations about the vacuum configuration ( [ w0 ] ) we find that all those fluctuations are stable .",
    "this dynamical stabilization of an apparent tree - level instability is formally analogous to what happens in the familiar situation of an ordinary kinetic term `` @xmath81 '' along with a symmetry breaking potential @xmath82 . in this case",
    "the naive vacuum @xmath46 is unstable because of the negative mass term , and shifting the field by a constant is sufficient to reach the true vacuum . in our model",
    "the analogous `` shift to the new vacuum '' is more involved since the field variable is shifted by an explicitly @xmath83-dependent field .",
    "the various candidates for the `` vacuum field configuration '' can be distinguished by their contribution to the expectation value of @xmath84 .",
    "clearly @xmath85 for the perturbative vacuum , while we find for the ground state ( [ w0 ] ) @xmath86 this is a translational invariant `` kinetic condensate '' quite analogous to the gluon condensate in qcd .",
    "the condensate ( [ i2 ] ) is nonanalytic in the coupling @xmath87 , i.e. it could not be seen in any finite order of perturbation theory .",
    "the remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows . in section",
    "[ 2 ] we discuss the classical vacua , i.e. the degenerate absolute minimum of the functional @xmath88 $ ] , and we determine the spectrum of small fluctuations about those field configurations . in sections [ 3 ] and [ 10 ] we review some aspects of the average action approach , and we discuss the phenomenon of `` classical renormalization '' .",
    "it is well known that in theories where standard perturbation theory about the trivial vacuum @xmath46 is applicable the lowest order ( i.e. , classical ) approximation of the loop expansion yields @xmath89 and , more generally , @xmath90 .",
    "we shall see that for unstable theories such as the one investigated here @xmath51 does _ not _ equal @xmath58 plus terms induced by loops .",
    "there are nontrivial renormalization effects even at the classical level .",
    "the reason is that in this case the loop expansion must be performed about the true minimum of the classical action rather than the false vacuum configuration @xmath46 . within the loop expansion",
    "this type of classical renormalization @xcite is refered to as `` instability induced '' @xcite as opposed to the familiar `` fluctuation induced '' renormalization coming from the loops . in order to understand the full quantum theory at a qualitative level it is often sufficient to take the classical renormalization of the effective action into account .",
    "it encodes the physics related to the shift to the true vacuum .    the average action @xmath71 is defined in terms of a functional integral which contains a modified classical action @xmath91 containing the ir - cutoff and source terms .",
    "the semiclassical expansion will be applied to this integral .",
    "therefore we need to know the absolute minimum @xmath92 of this functional . in section",
    "[ 4 ] we derive a sufficient condition for a configuration to be the global minimum of @xmath91 .",
    "this is used in section [ 5 ] in order to establish that for vanishing sources the minimum is constituted by spin waves of the type ( [ w0 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath93 the situation is more complicated and the corresponding discussion can be found in appendix [ acomplete ] .    in section [ 6 ]",
    "we compute the bilinear term of @xmath71 and derive the renormalization group flow of the dressed inverse propagator @xmath94 for vanishing background field . in particular , at the end point @xmath95 , we obtain the full quantum inverse propagator @xmath60 . in section",
    "[ 7 ] we identify regions in field space with no classical renormalization , i.e. configurations @xmath19 for which @xmath52=s[\\phi]$ ] is indeed true in lowest order .",
    "then , in section [ 8 ] , we combine all pieces of information available in order to draw a global picture of the effective average action @xmath71 .",
    "we introduce the momentum dependent potentials @xmath63 and use them to discuss the structure of the true vacuum .",
    "some calculational details are given in the appendices [ d ] , [ c ] and [ e ] .",
    "the conclusions are given in section [ 9 ] .",
    "for every euclidean field theory the field configuration @xmath96 with the smallest possible value of the action @xmath58 is of special importance . for a massless @xmath97-theory with an ordinary kinetic term @xmath98",
    "this configuration is @xmath99 which puts to zero the potential and the kinetic energy separately . in our case",
    "the situation is less trivial because @xmath59 can assume negative values and hence it is able to compensate for positive contributions coming from the potential .",
    "in fact , we shall prove later on in a more general context that the absolute minimum of the action ( [ a1 ] ) is achieved for the `` spin '' wave configurations @xmath100 here @xmath70 is an arbitrary unit vector ( a point on @xmath101 ) and @xmath74 is a free phase .",

    "we found strong renormalization effects which are `` instability induced '' rather than `` fluctuation induced '' .",
    "they are driven by the classical instability of the trivial saddle point in certain regions in the space of field configurations .",
    "this is related to the fact that the global minimum of the euclidean action @xmath88 $ ] is not at @xmath46 .",
    "instead , it is realized by nontrivial spin - wave configurations which form a space @xmath102 of classical vacua . at the level of the _",
    "effective _ theory , we found that the theory stabilizes itself in a dynamical way .",
    "the dressed kinetic operator @xmath476 gives a strictly positive action to all field modes with momenta @xmath373 . for modes with @xmath326 it vanishes .",
    "these modes are stabilized by a `` shift to the true vacuum '' which is similar to what happens in standard spontaneous symmetry breaking with a mexican - hat potential . the modes with @xmath326 form a spatially nonuniform , poincar- and phase - symmetry breaking condensate . within the semiclassical approximation ,",
    "the true vacuum consists of a single spin wave of momentum @xmath30 and amplitude @xmath477 , and is of an obviously nonperturbative nature therefore . the fixed phase and direction of this spin wave lead to a spontaneous breaking of the classical u(1)@xmath478iso(@xmath1 ) symmetry .    in this paper",
    "we only have considered a model without a classical mass term . due to our particular choice of the infrared cutoff @xmath140",
    "generalized results for models with a mass term can easily be infered from our results for nonvanishing @xmath53 .    in the introduction we mentioned that a strong motivation for studying this model is its similarity with euclidean quantum gravity based upon actions such as @xmath479 . for the conformal factor of the metric",
    "such an action contains a negative contribution to the kinetic energy , coming from @xmath44 and dominating at momenta small compared to the planck mass . at large momenta",
    "the action becomes positive and all modes are stable because of the manifestly positive contribution arising from @xmath480 . in view of this analogy",
    "it is plausible to speculate that also quantum gravity dynamically stabilizes the conformal factor by developing a nontrivial vacuum structure , with nonzero condensates such as @xmath481 , so that all excitations about this ground state are stable .    in the scalar model",
    "the semiclassical expansion about @xmath96 , the global minimum of @xmath91 , has led to an effective kinetic operator @xmath60 which has stabilized ( almost ) all modes which were unstable with respect to the classical @xmath59 . in gravity we might expect a similar mechanism to be at work when we expand about the global minimum of @xmath482 .",
    "roughly speaking , leaving finer details of the momentum dependence aside , the @xmath60-curve is obtained from @xmath59 by shifting it upward by a constant @xmath483-term @xmath484 , see fig .",
    "so the dynamical stabilization of the scalar model is essentially a `` mass generation '' .",
    "this mass generation also provides the justification for our loop expansion and retaining the lowest order contribution only .",
    "contrary to the case of massless models with an ordinary kinetic term where the loop expansion does not lead to reliable results @xcite , in our model the mass generation cuts off loops so that the loop correction to @xmath87 , for instance , is negligible .",
    "it is an important question how a similar mass generation would manifest itself in the effective average action for gravity , @xmath485 $ ] , and which type of truncations should be used in order to obtain it from the flow equation @xcite .",
    "it is clear that a naive mass term for the conformal factor is forbidden by general coordinate invariance .",
    "but also local curvature invariants @xmath43 , @xmath486 etc . are of no help because they vanish for flat space and will not lead to an effective action whose minimum is at @xmath487 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the relevant terms in @xmath51 and @xmath71 must be _ nonlocal _ if expressed in a gauge invariant way .",
    "( after gauge fixing , they may be local , nevertheless . ) for instance , a higher dimensional analogue of the @xmath488 induced gravity action @xmath489 , added to the einstein - hilbert term , is known to have flat space as its global minimum @xcite .",
    "hence all fluctuations about this ground state , including those of the conformal factor , are stable",
    ". therefore it would be very interesting to study the renormalization group flow of @xmath485 $ ] using a truncation of the space of actions which includes nonlocal invariants .",
    "work along these lines is in progress .",
    "one may wonder if the analogy between our model and gravity can be put even further . in a gauge fixed version of gravity the local symmetry of general coordinate transformations",
    "may be `` spontaneously broken '' , similar to the higgs - picture for local gauge theories . this language",
    "is usually employed in order to describe spontaneous compactification of higher dimensional theories .",
    "the fact that the minimum of the euclidean action occurs for a non - translationally invariant field configuration then strongly suggests the existence of additional space dimensions , @xmath490 . otherwise , for @xmath40 , the spectrum of excitations may not exhibit the full four - dimensional poincar symmetry , similar to the spectrum shown in fig .",
