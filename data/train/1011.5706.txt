    "in two classic papers  @xcite , by solving the master - slave optical system @xmath2 the author predicted that ultrafast pulses with energies lower than that required to self - sustain soliton shape in the anomalous dispersion regime of an optical medium may preserve their shape , provided an intense copropagating pump of a different color ( i.e. wavelength ) and a longer duration typical of soliton is present . since this key input as well as",
    "the subsequent experimental evidences reported in  @xcite it has become evident that besides their most common applications in long - distance transmission of high - power signals  @xcite , solitons could be prime candidates for controlling light by light  @xcite .",
    "more advanced studies have been carried out in recent years based on numerical simulations , and revealed that due to their unique stability properties solitons provide excellent and reliable guiding structures for reconfigurable low - power signals and re - routinable high - power pulses  @xcite .",
    "particularly attracting is the possibility to construct soliton networks that can be used as nonlinear waveguide arrays , as established in the landscape of recent experiments  @xcite emphasizing the outstanding robustness of the periodic lattices of optical solitons with flexible ( hence controllable ) refractive index modulation depth and period that are induced all - optically . in general , these periodic optical - soliton structures form in continuous nonlinear media where they develop into optically imprinted modulations with some effective refractive index . given the tunable character of the effective refractive index as well as the flexible modulation period , a great number of new opportunities for all - optical manipulation of light can be envisaged since in this case , periodic optical - soliton waveguides can operate in both weak and strong - coupling regimes depending on the depth of refractive index modulation .",
    "transmission techniques exploiting optically - induced waveguiding configurations with solitons are now common in several communication media such as laser  @xcite , photon  @xcite systems and photorefractive semiconductor  @xcite media .",
    "+ the present work aims at extending the phenomenon of signal reconfiguration by strong optical fields to the context of an harmonic cw beam trapped in the guiding structure of a periodic pulse train . as in a previous study  @xcite",
    "we assume that due to the competition between the self - phase modulation ( spm ) and cross - phase modulation ( xpm )  @xcite effects , the low - power probe can be reshaped giving rise to self - sustained optical signals trapped within the guiding structure of the temporal pulse multiplex .",
    "but before it is relavant to stress that the groundstate spectrum of the trapped probe in the case of one - soliton pump has been discussed in details  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is established both analytically and numerically that even in the steady - state regime of the pump propagation the probe groundstate is not well defined at any arbitrary value of the ratio between the cross - phase and self - phase modulation strengths but only for some specific choices of this ratio .",
    "for one particular value of this ratio involving well defined optical structures , it has been found  @xcite that the fundamental mode of the trapped probe groundstate consists of a single - pulse soliton with finite momentum .",
    "very recently , considering the same particular value of the xpm to the spm ratio we pointed out  @xcite that the physics of the pump - probe system turns to be quite rich if the pump is a periodic train of pulses , time - multiplexed at the input of an optical medium as for instance an optical fiber prior to propagation .",
    "namely , we found that in response to this temporal pulse multiplexing in the pump the trapped probe spectrum could burst into a band reflecting distinct possible induced fundamental soliton modes .",
    "+ still the competition between the spm and xpm effects is never of the same order and can change from one optical medium to another , implying quite distinct features and properties of the probe groundstate . in this last respect , for the value of the xpm to the spm ratio considered in our previous study we found  @xcite three distinct soliton modes , and observed that they form a complete orthogonal set of @xmath0 eigenstates two of which were almost degenerate .",
    "+ in the present study we shall go beyond previous considerations in terms of the order of the competition between the xpm and spm effects  @xcite , by considering two new representative but larger values of the ratio of their strengths .",
    "our ultimate goal through such assumptions is to point out an increasingly broadband and highly degenerate spectrum for the induced - soliton states in the probe , so broad and degenerate that the probe field can develop into a soliton quasi - continuum for sufficiently strong xpm effect relative to the spm effect .",
    "the pump - probe system of our current interest is described by the two coupled equations  @xcite : @xmath3 where  ( [ a1a ] ) is the pump equation assumed to describe propagation in a kerr - type optical fiber in the anomalous dispersion regime  @xcite , and  ( [ a1b ] ) is the linear equation corresponding to the harmonic probe .",
    "the quantities @xmath4 and @xmath5 are envelopes of the pump and probe respectively , @xmath6 is the group - velocity dispersion of the probe ( here taken arbitrary to account for possible difference with that of the pump ) , @xmath7 is the spm coefficient generic of nonlinearity in the pump source , @xmath8 in the second equation is the ( temporal ) walk - off between the pump and probe while @xmath9 measures the strength of the cross - phase interaction between the pump and probe . + our main point of focus is the probe equation  ( [ a1b ] ) which , as it stands , requires an explicit knowledge of shape profile of the fundamental mode composing the pump signal . as we are interested in a pump consisting of a train of time - multiplexed pulses , we focus on a classic implementation where the separation between pulses in the soliton train is varied by controlling their mutual interactions , namely via the dispersion - management technique",
    "( see more detailed discussions e.g. in  @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that such a periodic structure of equally separated pulses can well be represented by the sum : @xmath10 where , following parameter definitions in  @xcite , the quantity @xmath11 represents the number of channels in the time domain , @xmath12 is the initial temporal position of a given @xmath13 pulse in the input multiplex while @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the associate amplitude and central frequency respectively .",
    "the input time - multiplexed pulse structure  ( [ a3 ] ) can be reduced to the following single - valued function , using the exact summation rule for @xmath16 functions  @xcite : @xmath17e^{i\\left[\\omega t + \\frac{\\kappa^2\\omega^2}{2 } z + \\frac{q^2 - 2\\omega^2}{2 } z\\right ] } , \\label{a2}\\ ] ] which quite remarkably , coincides with the exact periodic - soliton solution of the pump equation  ( [ a1a ] )  @xcite .",
    "it is instructive specifying that @xmath18 in the above formula is the jacobi elliptic function of modulus @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the amplitude and @xmath21 is the characteristic pulse frequency .",
    "the jacobi elliptic function @xmath18 is periodic in its arguments @xmath22 and for the solution  ( [ a2 ] ) , the temporal period is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the elliptic integral of the first kind . in optical communication such solution",
    "has been claimed  @xcite ) to represents a steady - state structure describing a train of pulses , which equal temporal separation coincides with the period @xmath25 of the @xmath18 function .",
    "it is useful to end the current discussion on properties of the @xmath18 function by remarking that the one - to - one correspondance between  ( [ a2 ] ) and the piecewise multi - soliton signal intensity defined in  ( [ a2 ] ) , can easily be established by setting @xmath26 with @xmath27 an initial position , and constraining all pulses to have common amplitude @xmath14 ( hence common central frequency width @xmath28 ) . + now turning to the probe equation  ( [ a1b ] ) we remark to start that since the nonlinearity here proceeds from the xpm coupling to the pump , it is ready to anticipate arguing that any nonlinear mode emerging in the probe should be induced by the pump signal . therefore , to ensure full account of the steady - state feature of the pump soliton as well as the temporal multiplexing at the fiber entry",

    "moreover , their localized shapes are key asset in our quest for stable long - standing signals with soliton features . in the specific case of equation  ( [ a6a ] ) there are exactly five distinct localized modes that are induced by the soliton trap in the probe groundstate . these five modes , which can be induced simultaneously in the probe for a pump of sufficiently high intensity , form a complete set and the associate spectrum consists of the following eigenstates listed from the lowest to the highest modes ( in terms of the magntitudes of their respective modulation wavectors @xmath45 )  @xcite : + @xmath46 soliton mode : @xmath47 @xmath48 soliton mode : @xmath49 , \\nonumber \\\\   k_2(\\kappa)&= & k_{\\lambda } + \\frac{q^2d}{2}\\,\\left[2(2-\\kappa^2 ) - \\sqrt{1-\\kappa^2(1-\\kappa^2)}\\right ] , \\label{a7c } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath50 soliton mode : @xmath51 , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "according to expressions of the characteristic wavectors of the five soliton modes , this wavector shift is uniform and constant so that the temporal walk - off is not relevant to the generation mechanism of the localized modes , but strictly the competition between the xpm and spm couplings .",
    "+ in figure  [ fig : one ] , we sketched profiles of the intensities @xmath59 of the five soliton modes obtained above for arbitrary values of their normalization amplitudes .",

    ". moreover , as in this last structure where the fundamental signal is pulse shaped , the five modes are pulse - core periodic signals though with distinct periodicities . indeed , the first ( i.e. lowest ) and fourth modes are period - one double - pulse soliton trains , the second is a period - two one - pulse soliton train whereas the third and fifth modes are period - one one - pulse soliton trains .",
    "shapes of the fundamental solitons characterizing the five soliton modes are displayed in the right graphs of figure  [ fig : one ] , they are consistent both with the general analytical expressions  ( [ a7a])-([a7e ] ) when plotted for @xmath62 , and with the following explicit formula obtained from these solutions in the limit @xmath63 : + @xmath64 @xmath65 , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "since modes are characterized by their modulation wavectors within the pump trap and given that the modulation wavector determines the amount of energy cost to the pump for mode formation and stable , we expect the variations of the different @xmath70 obtained above to provide relevant additional insight onto spectral properties of the five modes .",

    "also remarkable are mode degeneracies , in this case we notice that the number of degenerate modes is higher and is expected to increase with increasing value of the ratio of the xpm to the spm coupling strengths .",
    "the induced - phase - modulation ( or cross - phase - modulation ) process has been predicted two decades ago  @xcite , and experimentally observed  @xcite to occur when a low - power signal ( either an harmonic cw signal or a weakly nonlinear signal ) couples to a high - intensity pump signal , the later one providing an optical waveguiding structure and reshaping channel to the first for substantial increase of its lifetime .",
    "however while this process is rather well understood for single - soliton pumps and in the case of relatively weak cross - phase - modulation processes , almost no insight exists about the context of pump signals consisting of periodic networks of temporal or spatial solitons  @xcite .",
    "the main objective of this work was to point out the great variety of spectral properties of pure harmonic cw probes trapped by a pump field consisting of a periodic wavetrain of optical pulses , when different orders of magnitudes of the cross - phase - modulation coupling are considered for the same self - phase - modulation coupling strength .",
    "the principal motivation for carrying out such analysis is the broad range of technological applications behind the possibility to combine , both quantitatively and qualitatively , multi - color soliton signals generated from on single pump field . on the other hand ,",
    "the very large diversity of physical properties expected from optical materials that can be fabricated via current technological means , makes it hard to think of physical contexts where cross - phase - modulation processes will always be far weaker than the intrinsic nonlinearity of pump fields . from these last standpoints",
    "the present study provides new interesting insight onto the general physics of pump - probe systems .",
    "in particular the increasingly large number and variety of possible soliton modes induced by the soliton pump for relatively strong cross - phase - modulation proceses , offers new opportunity to create multi - component vector solitons from optical low - power optical fields via light - induced waveguiding phenomena , thus enriching current designs of engineered ( i.e. artificially created ) soliton networks from reconfigurable non - soliton signals by means of all - optical techniques .",
    "to end , we wish to underline the richness of the fundamental modes emerging from the present study with increasing cross - phase - modulation coupling strength , for a fixed strength of the self - phase - modulation effect .",
    "while some of these modes have already been predicted  @xcite , in the present and our recent  @xcite works their spectral properties , conditions of existence as well as stability have been formally established .",
    "the key insight about these fundamental modes is that they put into play multi - pulse structures that are generated from the same pump , but with different modulation wavectors and hence different instantaneous wavelengths .",

    "<S> solutions of the probe equation give evidence that the competition between the self - phase and cross - phase modulations leads to a broadband spectrum , with the possibility of a quasi - continuum of soliton modes when the cross - phase - modulation coupling is strong enough . </S>"
