    "this paper treats the problem of screening a @xmath3-variate sample for strongly and multiply connected vertices in the partial correlation graph associated with the the partial correlation matrix of the sample .",
    "this problem , called hub screening , is important in many applications ranging from network security to computational biology to finance to social networks . in the area of network security ,",
    "a node that becomes a hub of high correlation with neighboring nodes might signal anomalous activity such as a coordinated flooding attack . in the area of computational biology",
    "the set of hubs of a gene expression correlation graph can serve as potential targets for drug treatment to block a pathway or modulate host response . in the area of finance a hub",
    "might indicate a vulnerable financial instrument or sector whose collapse might have major repercussions on the market . in the area of social networks",
    "a hub of observed interactions between criminal suspects could be an influential ringleader .",
    "the techniques and theory presented in this paper permit scalable and reliable screening for such hubs . unlike the correlations screening problem studied in this paper considers the more challenging problem of partial correlation screening for variables with a high degree of connectivity .",
    "in particular we consider 1 ) extension to the more difficult problem of screening for partial correlations exceeding a specified magnitude ; 2 ) extension to screening variables whose vertex degree in the associated partial correlation graph exceeds a specified degree .",
    "the hub screening theory presented in this paper can be applied to structure discovery in @xmath3-dimensional gaussian graphical models , a topic of recent interest to statisticians , computer scientists and engineers working in areas such as gene expression analysis , information theoretic imaging and sensor networks @xcite@xcite,@xcite .",
    "for example , the authors of @xcite propose a euclidean nearest neighbor graph method for testing independence in a gauss - markov random field model .",
    "when specialized to the null hypothesis of spatially independent gaussian measurements , our results characterize the large @xmath3 phase transitions and specify a weak ( poisson - like ) limit law on the number of highly connected nodes in such nearest neighbor graphs for finite number @xmath4 of observations .",
    "many different methods for inferring properties of correlation and partial correlation matrices have been recently proposed @xcite,@xcite , , , .",
    "several of these methods have been contrasted and compared in bioinformatics applications @xcite , , @xcite similar to the ones we consider in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiments ] .",
    "the above papers address the _ covariance selection _",
    "problem @xcite : to find the non - zero entries in the covariance or inverse covariance matrix or , equivalently , to find the edges in the associated correlation or partial correlation graph .",
    "the problem treated and the solution proposed in this paper differ from those of these previous papers in several important ways : 1 ) as contrasted to @xcite our objective is to screen for vertices in the graph instead of to screen for edges ; 2 ) unlike our objective is to directly control false positives instead of maximizing a likelihood function or minimizing a matrix norm approximation error ; 3 ) our framework is specifically adapted to the case of a finite number of samples and a large number of variables @xmath6 ) ; 4 ) our asymptotic theory provides mathematical expressions for the p - value for each of the variables with respect to a sparse null hypothesis on the covariance ; 5 ) unlike lasso type methods like the hub screening implementation can be directly applied to very large numbers of variables without the need for initial variable reduction .",
    "additional relevant literature on correlation based methods can be found in .    for specified @xmath7 $ ] and @xmath8 ,",
    "a hub is defined broadly as any variable that is correlated with at least @xmath1 other variables with magnitude correlation exceeding @xmath0 .",
    "hub screening is accomplished by thresholding the sample correlation matrix or partial correlation matrix and searching for rows with more than @xmath1 non - zero entries .",
    "we call the former _ correlation hub screening _ and the latter _ partial correlation hub screening_. the screening is performed in a computationally efficient manner by exploiting the equivalence between correlation graphs and ball graphs on the set of z - scores .",
    "specifically , assume that @xmath4 samples of @xmath3 variables are available in the form of a data matrix where @xmath9 .",
    "first the columns of the data matrix are converted to standard @xmath4-variate z - scores .",
    "the set of @xmath3 z - scores uniquely determine the sample correlation matrix .",
    "if partial correlations are of interest , these z - score are replaced by equivalent modified z - scores that characterize the sample partial correlation matrix , defined as the moore - penrose pseudo - inverse of the sample correlation matrix . then an approximate k - nearest neighbor ( ann ) algorithm is applied to the z - scores or the modified z - scores to construct a ball graph associated with the given threshold @xmath0 .",
    "hub variables are discovered by scanning the graph for those whose vertex degree exceeds @xmath1 .",
    "the ann approach only computes a small number of the sample correlations or partial correlations , circumventing the difficult ( or impossible ) task of computing all entries of the correlation matrix when there are millions ( or billions ) of variables .",
    "state - of - the - art ann software has been demonstrated on over a billion variables @xcite and thus our proposed hub screening procedure has potential application to problems of massive scale .",
    "we also note that using the standard moore - penrose inverse is well understood to be a sub - optimal estimator of the partial correlation matrix in terms of minimum mean square error @xcite . to our knowledge",
    "its properties for screening for partial correlations has yet to be investigated .",
    "this paper demonstrates that its potential use in detecting high partial correlations as compared to estimating them",
    ".    no screening procedure would be complete without error control .",
    "we establish limiting expressions for mean hub discovery rates .",
    "these expressions are used to obtain an approximate phase transition threshold @xmath2 below which the average number of hub discoveries abruptly increases . when the screening threshold @xmath0 is below @xmath2 the discoveries are likely to be dominated by false positives .",
    "we then show that the number of discoveries is dominated by a random variable that converges to a poisson limit as @xmath0 approaches @xmath10 and @xmath3 goes to infinity .",
    "thus the probability of making at least one hub discovery converges to a poisson cumulative distribution . in the case of independent",
    "identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "elliptically distributed samples and sparse block diagonal covariance matrix , the mean of the dominating variable does not depend on the unknown correlations . in this case we can specify asymptotic p - values on hub discoveries of given degree under a sparse - covariance null model .",
    "finite @xmath3 bounds on the poisson p - value approximation error are given that decrease at rates determined by @xmath3 , @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and the sparsity factor of the covariance matrix .",
    "to illustrate the power of the hub screening methods we apply them to a public gene expression datases : the nki breast cancer data @xcite .",
    "each of these datasets contains over twenty thousand variables ( genes ) but many fewer observations ( genechips ) .",
    "the screening reveals interesting and previously unreported dependency structure among the variables . for the purposes of exploring neighborhood structure of the discoveries we introduce a waterfall plot of their approximate p - values that plots the family of degree - indexed p - value curves over the range of correlation thresholds",
    "this graphic rendering can provide insight into the structure and significance of the correlation neighborhoods as we sweep the variables over different vertex degree curves in the waterfall plot .",
