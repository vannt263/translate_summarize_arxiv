    "one of the big questions in star formation is what determines the rate of star formation in galaxies ?",
    "another , more pointed way of phrasing this question is to ask why the star formation rate in normal galaxies is so low , and why it varies so strongly , over orders of magnitude from low surface brightness galaxies , through normal galaxies , to starburst galaxies .",
    "the free - fall time for gas at typical interstellar densities is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the mean mass density of the gas , @xmath2 the gravitational constant and @xmath3 the number density , with @xmath4 .",
    "yet galactic ages range up to @xmath5  yr , and star formation continues today . what has delayed star formation sufficiently to allow it to continue ?    in what might be called the standard theory of star formation , magnetic fields are invoked to answer both of these questions .",
    "if fields are strong enough , they can magnetostatically support clouds against collapse .",
    "the star formation rate would then be determined by the rate of ambipolar drift of neutral gas past ions tied to the magnetic field towards the centers of self - gravitating cores @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if the fields are strong enough that the alfvn speed @xmath6 reaches the rms velocity @xmath7 , then strong shocks will be converted to mhd waves . as linear alfvn waves are lossless , it was thought that motions remaining from the initial formation of the clouds might be enough to explain the observation of strongly supersonic motions in molecular clouds @xcite . in this review",
    "i will explain why both of these ideas now appear questionable .",
    "first let us consider the decay of supersonic turbulence as shown in figure  [ decaysix ] .    ,",
    "0.6 and 1.0 on slices through the decaying supersonic hydrodynamic models c and d with initial rms mach number @xmath8 described in @xcite at standard resolution ( @xmath9 ) and high resolution ( @xmath10 ) , where @xmath11 is the sound crossing time of our numerical box .",
    "note that each image is scaled to its own maximum and minimum to enhance morphological features ( from  @xcite ) ]    i call on computations performed with two different methods : eulerian hydrodynamics and mhd on a grid , using the code zeus-3d @xcite , available from the laboratory for computational astrophysics at    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ http://zeus.ncsa.uiuc.edu/lca_home_page.html , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    and lagrangian hydrodynamics using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code derived from that described by benz @xcite and monaghan @xcite , running on special purpose grape processors @xcite , and incorporating sink particles @xcite .",
    "we chose initial conditions for our models inspired by the popular idea that setting up velocity perturbations with an initial power spectrum @xmath12 in fourier space similar to that of developed turbulence would be in some way equivalent to starting with developed turbulence @xcite . observing the development of our models ,",
    "it became clear to us that the loss of phase information in the power spectrum  @xcite allows extremely different gas distributions to have the same power spectrum .",
    "this is particularly important for supersonic flows .",
    "supersonic , hd turbulence has been found in simulations @xcite to have a power spectrum @xmath13 .",
    "however , any single , discontinuous shock wave will also have such a power spectrum , as that is simply the fourier transform of a step function , and taking the fourier transform of many shocks will not change this power law .",
    "nevertheless , most distributions with @xmath13 do not contain shocks .",
    "after experimentation , we decided that the quickest way to generate fully developed turbulence was with perturbations having a flat power spectrum @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "we set up velocity perturbutions drawn from a gaussian random field fully determined by its power spectrum in fourier space following the standard procedure : for each wavenumber @xmath16 we randomly select an amplitude from a gaussian distribution centered on zero and with width @xmath17 with @xmath18 , and a phase between zero and @xmath19 .",
    "we then transform the field back into real space to obtain the velocity in each zone .",
    "this is done independently for each velocity component . for the sph calculation",
    "the velocities defined on the grid are assigned onto individual particles using the `` cloud - in - cell '' scheme @xcite . in all of our models",
    "we take @xmath20 , initial density @xmath21 , and we use a periodic grid with sides @xmath22 centered on the origin .",
    "these parameter choices define our unit system .",
    "our choice of periodic boundary conditions corresponds to the case of free turbulence discussed above , at least initially .",
    "thereafter , the appropriate treatment is less clear .",
    "we next performed resolution studies using zeus for three different cases with no field , weak field and strong field as shown in fig .",
    "[ prlres ] .    , isothermal models .",
    "zeus models have @xmath23 ( _ dotted _ ) , @xmath24 ( _ short dashed _ ) , @xmath9 ( _ long dashed _ ) , or @xmath10 ( _ solid _ ) zones , while the sph models have 7000 ( _ dotted _ ) , 50,000 ( _ short dashed _ ) , or 350,000 ( _ solid _ ) particles .",

    "d ) _ @xmath26 mhd runs with zeus ( from  @xcite ) ]    the weak field models have an initial ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure @xmath27 , while the strong field models have @xmath28 .",
    "we ran the same unmagnetized model with the sph code to demonstrate that our results are truly independent of the details of the viscous dissipation , and so that our lack of an explicit viscosity does not affect our results .",
    "the kinetic energy decay curves for the four resolution studies are shown in fig .",
    "[ prlres ] . for each of our runs we performed a least - squares fit to the slope of the power - law portion of the kinetic energy decay curves .",
    "these results appear converged at the 510% level ; it is very reassuring that the different numerical methods converge to the same result for the unmagnetized case .",
    "we find that highly compressible , isothermal turbulence decays close to linearly in time , with @xmath29 .",
    "adding magnetic fields decreases the decay rate only slightly to @xmath300.850.9 , with very slight dependence on the field strength or adiabatic index .",
    "similar results have been reported by stone , ostriker , & gammie  @xcite and padoan & nordlund  @xcite for compressible mhd turbulence , and by biskamp & mller  @xcite for incompressible mhd turbulence .",
    "the clear astrophysical implication of these models is that even strong magnetic fields , with the field in equipartition with the kinetic energy , can not prevent the decay of turbulent motions on dynamical timescales .",
    "if molecular clouds live for longer than their dynamical time of roughly a megayear , as is generally believed even by those arguing for lifetimes under 10  myr  @xcite rather than the more classical 30  myr  @xcite , then the significant kinetic energy observed in their gas must be supplied more or less continuously .",
    "to compute the energy dissipation from uniformly driven turbulence we initialize the turbulent flow with a narrow band of @xmath31 values , using a top - hat function with roughly the same behavior as the steeply peaked curve used by stone et al .",
    "@xcite in most of their models .",
    "we set the velocity field up as described above  @xcite .",
    "to drive the turbulence , we then normalize this fixed pattern to produce a set of perturbations @xmath32 , and at every time step add a velocity field @xmath33 to the velocity @xmath34 , with the amplitude @xmath35 now chosen to maintain constant kinetic energy input rate @xmath36",
    ". for compressible flow with a time - dependent density distribution , maintaining a constant energy input rate requires solving a quadratic equation in the amplitude @xmath35 at each time step . for a grid with @xmath37 zones on a side ,",
    "each of volume @xmath38 , the equation for @xmath35 is @xmath39 we take the larger root of this equation to get the value of @xmath35 .",
    "the resulting flow is shown in fig .",

    "happily , these are just the length and velocity scales that would be expected from the theory of _ incompressible _ turbulence .",
    "figure  [ ecalfig ] shows     where @xmath44 is the dimensionless driving wavenumber , and the size of the cube @xmath22 for all runs .",
    "the lines have slope of unity , and are fit to the hydro models , yielding the value for the dissipation coefficient @xmath45 ( see equation  [ [ vdiss ] ] ) .",
    "hydrodynamical models are indicated by squares , mhd models by triangles ( from  @xcite ) ]    equilibrium energy dissipation rates for all the models described by mac low  @xcite , compared to the quantity @xmath46 .",
    "a fit to the hydrodynamic models gives a relation with slope 1.02 .",
    "let us define a dimensionalized wavenumber @xmath47 .",
    "a very good approximation is then the linear relation @xmath48 with @xmath45 , where the assumption is made that in equilibrium @xmath49 .",
    "the dependence on the mass of the cube @xmath50 comes strictly from dimensional arguments , as all of the runs shown have the same mass @xmath51 .",
    "the referee of this review points out that @xmath52 , remarkably close to the value of @xmath53 that would be expected by direct application of the theory of incompressible turbulence .",
    "this implies that the density variations average out almost independently of velocity variations .",
    "the mhd models that fit equations  ( [ vdiss ] ) most closely are the strong field cases , with @xmath54 .",
    "the weak field cases appear to follow a relation similar to equation  ( [ vdiss ] ) , but with values of @xmath55 up to a factor of two higher , as shown in figure  [ ecalfigb ] .     on the plasma @xmath56 , the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure .",
    "the dashed line shows the value derived from unmagnetized models .",
    "models with weaker fields appear to have as much as a factor two higher dissipation rate , while strong field models approach the unmagnetized rate ( from  @xcite ) ]    without further computation , it remains unclear how much of the variation seen among the models with the same @xmath56 is due to random fluctuations or the remaining lack of numerical convergence , and how much is real . the higher dissipation seen in the high-@xmath56 , weak - field cases",
    "could be explained by noting that weak fields will be more strongly influenced by the flow , generating more dissipative mhd waves .",
    "we can use these results to discuss whether decaying turbulence can delay gravitational collapse .",
    "this can formally be examined by determining whether the ratio @xmath57 where the turbulent decay time @xmath58 , and the free - fall time @xmath59 for the gas is given by equation  ( [ equ : tff ] ) . because @xmath60 depends not only on the strength of the turbulence , but also on the driving wavelength , the value of @xmath61 also depends on the ratio @xmath62 where the jeans wavelength @xmath63 .",
    "numerical models that i disucss in the next section show that turbulence can not support the gas against collapse at wavelengths longer than the driving wavelength @xcite , so that @xmath64 is necessary for the turbulence to fully support against collapse .    substituting for the values in equation  ( [ tau1 ] ) ,",
    "we can write @xmath65 we can now use equation  ( [ vdiss ] ) for @xmath66 , and , somewhat less accurately , take @xmath67 , noting that this introduces no more than a 2030% error . substituting and using the definition of @xmath68 given in equation  ( [ kappa1 ] ) , i find that the dissipation time scaled in units of the free fall time is @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the rms mach number of the turbulence . in molecular clouds , @xmath71 is typically observed to be of order 10 or higher , while @xmath72 is required for support , so turbulence will decay long before the cloud collapses and not markedly influence its collapse .",
    "now that it is clear that driven turbulence must be present in molecular clouds , we can ask whether it alone is sufficient to support clouds against gravitational collapse .",
    "the virial theorem provides a first way of examining this question . in equilibrium",
    "the total kinetic energy in the system adds up to half its potential energy , @xmath73 . if @xmath74 the system collapses , while @xmath75 implies expansion . in turbulent clouds ,",
    "the total kinetic energy includes not only the internal energy but also the contributions from turbulent gas motions .",
    "if this is taken into account , simple energy considerations can already provide a qualitative description of the collapse behavior of turbulent self - gravitating media @xcite .    a more thorough investigation , however , requires a linear stability analysis . for the case of an isothermal , infinite , homogeneous , self - gravitating medium at rest ( i.e.  without turbulent motions ) jeans",
    "@xcite derived a relation between the oscillation frequency @xmath76 and the wave number @xmath31 of small perturbations , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the isothermal sound speed , @xmath2 the gravitational constant , and @xmath79 the initial mass density .",
    "note that the derivation includes the ad hoc assumption that the linearized version of the poisson equation describes only the relation between the perturbed potential and the perturbed density , neglecting the potential of the homogeneous solution .",
    "this is the so - called ` jeans swindle ' .",
    "perturbations are unstable against gravitational contraction if their wave number is below a critical value , the jeans wave number @xmath80 , i.e.  if @xmath81 or equivalently if the wave length of the perturbation exceeds a critical size given by @xmath82 .",
    "this directly translates into a mass limit .",
    "all perturbations with masses exceeding the jeans mass , @xmath83 will collapse under their own weight .",
    "these and subsequent analytical approaches ( reviewed in @xcite ) make a strong assumption that substantially limits their reliability , namely that the equilibrium state is homogeneous , with constant density @xmath79 .",
    "however , observations clearly show that molecular clouds are extremely non - uniform .",
    "one way to achieve progress and circumvent the restrictions of a purely analytical approach is to perform numerical simulations .",
    "bonazzola et al .",
    "@xcite , for example , used low resolution ( @xmath84 collocation points ) calculations with a 2-dimensional spectral code to support their analytical results .",

    "magnetic fields were introduced in two dimensions by passot , vzquez - semadeni , & pouquet  @xcite , and extended to three dimensions with self - gravity ( though at only @xmath24 resolution ) by vzquez - semadeni , passot , & pouquet  @xcite .",
    "a careful analysis of 1-dimensional computations including both mhd and self - gravity was presented by gammie & ostriker  @xcite , who extended their work to 2.5 dimensions more recently  @xcite .",
    "we use zeus-3d and sph to examine the gravitational stability of three - dimensional hydrodynamical turbulence at higher resolution than before , and include magnetic fields using zeus-3d .",
    "the use of both lagrangian and eulerian numerical methods to solve the equations of self - gravitating hydrodynamics in three dimensions ( 3d ) allows us to attempt to bracket reality by taking advantage of the strengths of each approach .",
    "this also gives us some protection against interpreting numerical artifacts as physical effects .",
    "sph can resolve very high density contrasts because it increases the particle concentration , and thus the effective spatial resolution , in regions of high density , making it well suited for computing collapse problems as shown in fig .",
    "[ khm - fig1 ] .    , shown ( * a * ) at the time when gravity is turned on , ( * b * ) when the first dense cores are formed and have accreted @xmath85% of the mass , ( * c * ) when the mass in dense cores is @xmath86% , and ( * d * ) when @xmath87% .",
    "time is measured in units of the global system free - fall time scale @xmath88 ( from  @xcite),scaledwidth=80.0% ]    by the same token , though , it resolves low - density regions poorly .",
    "shock structures tend to be broadened by the averaging kernel in the absence of adaptive techniques .",
    "the correct numerical treatment of gravitational collapse requires the resolution of the local jeans mass at every stage of the collapse  @xcite . in the current code , once an object with density beyond the resolution limit of the code has formed in the center of a collapsing gas clump it is replaced by a ` sink ' particle @xcite . adequately replacing high - density cores and keeping track of their further evolution in a consistent way prevents the time step from becoming prohibitively small .",
    "we are thus able to follow the collapse of a large number of cores until the overall gas reservoir becomes exhausted .",
    "zeus-3d , conversely , gives us equal resolution in all regions , and allows us to resolve shocks well everywhere , as well as allowing the inclusion of magnetic fields , as shown in fig .",

    "the density greyscale is given in the colorbar .",
    "( from  @xcite),scaledwidth=70.0% ]    on the other hand , collapsing regions can not be followed to scales less than one or two cells .",
    "we must again consider the resolution required for gravitational collapse .",
    "for a grid - based simulation , the criterion given by truelove et al .",
    "@xcite holds .",
    "equivalent to the sph resolution criterion , the mass contained in one grid zone has to be rather smaller than the local jeans mass throughout the computation .",
    "applying this criterion strictly would limit our simulations to the very first stages of collapse , as we have not implemented anything like sink particles in zeus .",
    "we have therefore extended our models beyond the point of full resolution of the collapse , as we are primarily interested in the formation of collapsed regions , but not their subsequent evolution .",
    "thus , in the zeus models , the fixed spatial resolution of the grid implies that strongly collapsed cores have a larger cross - section than appropriate for their mass . in encounters with shock fronts",
    "the probability for these cores to get destroyed or lose material is overestimated .",
    "cores simulated with zeus are therefore more easily disrupted than they would be physically .",
    "sph , on the other hand , underestimates the disruption probability , because sink particles can not lose mass or dissolve again once they have formed .",
    "the physical result is thus _ bracketed _ by these two numerical methods .",
    "we use the same driving method as described above for both the sph and zeus models .",
    "we define an effective turbulent jeans mass @xmath94 by substituting @xmath95 for the thermal sound speed @xmath78 in equation  ( [ eqn : jeans - mass ] ) where we approximate the rms velocity of the flow @xmath96 by @xmath97 .",
    "the turbulent jeans mass @xmath94 must be compared to the total system mass @xmath98 in order to determine whether global stability is reached .",
    "we find that _ local _ collapse occurs even when the turbulent velocity field carries enough energy to counterbalance gravitational contraction on global scales , as shown in fig .",

    "the presence of shocks in supersonic turbulence drastically alters the result from analytic models of incompressible turbulence , as was first noted by elmegreen  @xcite and studied numerically by vzquez - semadeni et al .",
    "the density contrast in isothermal shocks scales quadratically with the mach number , so the shocks driven by supersonic turbulence create density enhancements with @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the _ rms _ mach number of the flow . in such fluctuations",
    "the local jeans mass is _ decreased _ by a factor of @xmath101 and therefore the likelihood for gravitational collapse _",

    "larson  @xcite himself mentioned that the relationships he found might be due to the limitations of the observations .",
    "kegel  @xcite first demonstrated that the observed mean density - size relationship could be due to observational effects , and that the observed and physical values of properties such as radius or volumetric density might be quite different .",

    "this minimum is just given by the density threshold we used in clumpfind .",
    "third , even though the simulations exhibit a large dynamical range in density ( @xmath151 ) , the dynamical range in the mean density - size relationship is small , because in constructing such a plot we choose the clumps around the local density maxima .    in the middle and lower panels of fig .",
    "[ jbp - fig9 ] we show the mean density - size relationship for clumps in simulated observational maps of the same run , integrated along the @xmath152 axis .",
    "the middle panel is the one obtained by using cs(1 - 0 ) , and the lower panel is the relationship obtained by using @xmath142co(1 - 0 ) .",
    "the observed clumps do exhibit approximately the relationship given by larson  @xcite , despite the lack of correlation exhibited by the physical clumps in this model .",
    "we conclude from this demonstration that the observed density - size relationship ( eq .  [ [ rhomean ] ] ) is an observational artifact .",
    "kegel  @xcite suggested one mechanism that appears able to explain our results : only clouds with emission exceeding some intensity threshold will be detected , effectively setting a column density cutoff , rather than the physical density cutoff imposed in the physical density - size relationship .",
    "( this threshold is determined by the noise level in observations , or by some average intensity in the simulated observations ) .",
    "a constant column density cutoff produces a cutoff with slope @xmath153 in the mean density - size plane ( middle and lower panels ) , just as the constant physical density cutoff in physical space produces a flat cutoff .",
    "both support against gravity and maintenance of observed motions appear to depend on continued driving of the turbulence , as i have described . what then is the energy source for this driving ?",
    "motions coming from gravitational collapse have often been suggested , but fail due to the quick decay of the turbulence as described above .",
    "if the turbulence decays in less than a free - fall time , then it can not delay collapse for substantially longer than a free - fall time  @xcite .",
    "protostellar jets and outflows are another popular suspect for the energy source of the observed turbulence .",
    "they are indeed quite energetic , but they deposit most of their energy into low density gas , as is shown by the observation of multi - parsec long jets extending completely out of molecular clouds  @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "as described in the previous section , the observed motions show increasing power on scales all the way up to and perhaps beyond the largest scale of molecular cloud complexes  @xcite .",
    "it is hard to see how such large scales could be driven by protostars embedded in the clouds .",
    "another energy source that has long been considered is shear from galactic rotation .",
    "work by sellwood & balbus  @xcite has shown that magnetorotational instabilities  @xcite could couple the large - scale motions to small scales efficiently . for parameters appropriate to the far outer h  i",
    "disk of the milky way , they derive a resulting velocity dispersion of 6  km  s@xmath134 , close to that observed .",
    "this instability may provide a base value for the velocity dispersion below which no galaxy will fall . if that is sufficient to prevent collapse , little or no star formation will occur , producing something like a low surface brightness galaxy with large amounts of h  i and few stars .    in active star - forming galaxies , however , clustered and field supernova explosions appear likely to dominate the driving , raising the velocity dispersion to the 1015 km  s@xmath134 observed in star - forming portions of galaxies ( see work cited in @xcite for example )",
    ". these explosions will be predominantly from b  stars no longer associated with their parent gas , as they are far more numerous than more massive o  stars , have explosions that are just as powerful , and live long enough ( up to 50  myr ) to either drift away from or ionize their parent clouds .",
    "this provides a large - scale self - regulation mechanism for star formation in disks with sufficient gas density to collapse despite the velocity dispersion produced by the magnetorotational instability .",
    "as star formation increases in such galaxies , the number of ob stars increases , ultimately increasing the supernova rate and thus the velocity dispersion , which will restrain further star formation .",
    "supernova driving not only determines the velocity dispersion , but may actually form molecular clouds by sweeping gas up in a turbulent flow .",
    "clouds that are turbulently supported will experience inefficient , low - rate star formation , while clouds that are too massive to be supported will collapse  @xcite , undergoing efficient star formation to form ob associations or even starburst knots .",
    "we study supernova driving in a magnetized medium numerically , using the riemann framework for computational astrophysics , which is based on higher - order godunov schemes for mhd @xcite , and incorporates schemes for pressure positivity @xcite , and divergence - free magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "( the framework also includes parallelized , divergence - conserving , mhd adaptive mesh refinement @xcite , though no results using that capability are shown here . ) in the models presented here , we solve the ideal mhd equations including both radiative cooling and pervasive heating in a ( 200 pc)@xmath154 periodic computational box , using a grid of 128@xmath154 cells .",
    "we start the simulations with a uniform density of @xmath155 g @xmath156 , threaded by a uniform magnetic field in the @xmath152-direction with strength 5.8 @xmath157 g , a factor of roughly two stronger than that observed in the milky way disk .",
    "this very strong field maximizes the effects of magnetization on the turbulence .    for the cooling",
    ", we use a tabulated version of the radiative cooling curve shown in figure  1 of macdonald and bailey  @xcite , which is based on the work of raymond , cox & smith  @xcite and shapiro and moore  @xcite .",
    "( it falls smoothly from temperatures of order @xmath158  k to @xmath159  k , not incorporating a sharp cutoff at @xmath160  k due to the turnoff of ly@xmath161 cooling . )",
    "in order to prevent the gas from cooling below zero , we set the lower temperature cutoff for the cooling at 100  k. we also include a diffuse heating term to represent processes such as photoelectric heating by starlight , which we set constant in both space and time .",
    "we set the heating level such that the initial equilibrium temperature determined by heating and cooling balance is 3000  k.    we explode sne at a rate of one every 0.1 myr in our box , twelve times higher than our present galactic rate , corresponding to a mild starburst like m82 .",
    "the sne are permitted to explode at random positions .",
    "each sn explosion dumps 10@xmath162 erg thermal energy into a sphere with radius 5 pc .",
    "the evolution of the system is determined by the energy input from sn explosions and diffuse heating and the energy lost by radiative cooling .",
    "an example of the resulting turbulence is shown in figure  [ image ] .",
    "the first theories of the multi - phase ism , such as field , goldsmith , & habing  @xcite , postulated an isobaric medium .",
    "since then , multi - phase models have commonly been interpreted as being isobaric , although mckee & ostriker  @xcite and wolfire et al .",
    "@xcite actually assume only local pressure equilibrium , not global , and mckee & ostriker  @xcite considered the distribution of pressures .",
    "in typical multi - phase models , the heating and cooling rates of the gas have different dependences on the temperature and density , so that the balance between heating and cooling determines allowed temperatures and densities for any particular pressure .",
    "this balance can be shown graphically in a phase diagram , showing , for example , the allowed densities for any pressure ( @xcite ; for a modern example , see fig .",
    "3(_a _ ) of @xcite ) .    in figure  [ press - f5 ] , the thermal - equilibrium curve for the     myrs in the mhd simulation m2 , showing @xmath23 points sampled at intervals of four points in each direction .",
    "note that for each density a wide variation in pressure is seen .",
    "cool gas with @xmath163 is shown in blue , warm gas with @xmath164 in green , and hot gas with @xmath165 in red .",
    "the thermal equilibrium curve for the cooling and heating functions in this simulation is overlaid as a black line .",
    "( the line of points at the very bottom right corresponds to an absolute cutoff in the cooling at 100  k that was enforced on the temperature in this model . )",
    "note that our cooling curve may artificially prevent much low - temperature gas from forming in this model . from @xcite [ press - f5],scaledwidth=100.0% ]    heating and cooling mechanisms included is shown as a black line .",
    "only a single phase is predicted at high densities as our cooling curve did not include the physically - expected unstable region at temperatures of order @xmath166  k  @xcite .",
    "thus , if our model produced an isobaric medium , it would be expected to have a single low - temperature phase in uniform density given by the point at which the thermal - equilibrium curve crosses that pressure level .",
    "( effectively , we would have the hotter two of the three phases proposed by mckee & ostriker  @xcite . )",
    "the scattered points in figure  [ press - f5 ] show the actual density and pressure of individual zones in the model .",
    "many zones at low temperature do lie on the thermal equilibrium curve , but scattered all up and down it at many different pressures and densities .",
    "furthermore , a substantial fraction of the gas has not had time to reach thermal equilibrium at all after dynamical compression .",
    "it appears that pressures are determined dynamically , and the gas then tries to adjust its density and temperature to reach thermal equilibrium at that pressure .",
    "most gas will land on the thermal equilibrium curve when dynamical times are long compared to heating and cooling times .    even if we include the proper physics to allow multiple phases , the behavior observed in our model will lead to all points within the range of pressures available along the thermal equilibrium line being occupied , rather than the appearance of discrete phases ( also see the chapter by vzquez - semadeni et al .",
    "in this volume ) .",
    "unstable regions along the thermal equilibrium curve  @xcite and off it will also be populated , as observed by heiles  @xcite , but not as densely , as gas will indeed attempt to heat or cool to a stable thermal equilibrium at its current pressure .",
    "in particular , cold high pressure regions can be formed dynamically , without the influence of self - gravity , perhaps giving a method for forming molecular clouds with observed properties that are not in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the relation between magnetic and thermal pressure is shown in figure  [ press - f6 ] . in this figure , the relative strength of thermal and magnetic pressure is shown at one time for the magnetized simulation .",
    "the scattering of regions at very low thermal pressure all have substantial magnetic pressures , demonstrating that magnetically supported regions can occur . however , their relative importance is rather low , as shown by the small number of points in that regime .",
    "hot gas can be seen , on the other hand , to be dominated by thermal pressure , with low magnetic pressures .",
    "myrs in the mhd simulation .",
    "we again plotted a subset of @xmath23 points sampled at intervals of four points in each direction .",
    "note that regions of very low thermal pressure have substantial magnetic pressures . from @xcite [ press - f6],scaledwidth=100.0% ]    as we have shown , the supernova - driven models have broad ranges of pressures .",
    "we can quantify this by examining the pressure probability density function ( pdf ) , as shown in figure  [ press - pdfs ] . in both cases , these show roughly log - normal pressure pdfs , very unlike the power - law distributions predicted by the analytic theory derived by mckee & ostriker  @xcite .",
    "the observed distributions rather more resemble the log - normal density distributions suggested by passot & vzquez - semadeni  @xcite .",
    "mac low et al .",
    "@xcite show that the cool gas can actually be modeled quite successfully with this heuristic theory .",
    "* even relatively strong magnetic fields , with the field in equipartition with the kinetic energy , can not prevent the decay of turbulent motions on dynamical timescales far shorter than the observed lifetimes of molecular clouds .",
    "the significant kinetic energy observed in molecular cloud gas must be supplied more or less continuously . *",
    "supersonic turbulence strong enough to globally support a molecular cloud against collapse will usually cause _ local _ collapse .",
    "the turbulence establishes a complex network of interacting shocks .",
    "the local density enhancements in fluctuations created by converging shock flows can be large enough to become gravitationally unstable and collapse .",
    "the probability for this to happen , the efficiency of the process , and the rate of continuing accretion onto collapsed cores are strongly dependent on the driving wave length and on the rms velocity of the turbulent flow , and thus on the driving mechanism . *",
    "interstellar clouds driven on large scales or without even global turbulent support very rapidly form stars in clusters . on the contrary , in gas that is supported by turbulence",
    ", local collapse occurs sporadically over a large time interval , forming isolated stars .",
    "the total star formation efficiency before the cloud dissolves due to stellar feedback or external shocks will probably be low .",
    "thus , the strength and nature of the turbulence may be fully sufficient to explain the difference between the observed isolated and clustered modes of star formation .",
    "* magnetorotational instabilities may provide a base value for the velocity dispersion below which no galaxy will fall .",
    "if that is sufficient to prevent collapse , little or no star formation will occur , producing something like a low surface brightness galaxy with large amounts of h  i and few stars . in star - forming galaxies , however , clustered and field supernova explosions , predominantly from b  stars no longer associated with their parent gas , appear likely to dominate the driving , raising the velocity dispersion to some 1015 km  s@xmath134 .",
    "* in a supernova - driven interstellar medium , we find a broad range of pressures with a log - normal distribution , and a substantial fraction of associated densities far from the thermal equilibrium values .",
    "this limits the predictive usefulness of phase diagrams based on thermal equilibrium , although thermal equilibrium at the local pressure will still be the mildly favored state .",
    "gas pressures appear to be determined dynamically , and each individual parcel of gas seeks local thermal equilibrium at the pressure imposed on it by the turbulent flow .",
    "inferences that molecular clouds must be gravitationally bound because of their high observed confinement pressures are called into question by these results .",
    "regions with densities approaching the overall densities of gmcs , and pressures an order of magnitude above the average interstellar pressure appear in our simulations even in the absence of self - gravity .",
