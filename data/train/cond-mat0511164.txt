    "more than a century after drude @xcite published his pioneering work zur ionentheorie der metalle ( on the ion theory of metals ) , the optical conductivity is one of the most useful tools @xcite to investigate the basic properties of metals .",
    "both the excitation spectrum of metals ( gaps , phonons , magnons , interband transitions , ... ) and the scattering mechanisms leave their distinct traces in transport .",
    "it is surprising that the drude model , which was developed before even the concepts of electrons ( and fermions in general ) had been established , describes much of the phenomenology of low - frequency transport in metals correctly .    in this paper",
    "we will review some basic ( but apparently not very well known ) facts about the conductivity and low - frequency optical properties of clean metals .",
    "we will concentrate our discussion on the lowest frequencies , i.e. on the drude peak at low but finite temperature , and on the @xmath4 optical conductivity at the lowest frequencies .",
    "we will not consider the effects of disorder or phonons but study only the effects of electron - electron interactions in clean fermi liquids .",
    "parts of results discussed here have already been published in ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath4 optical conductivity of d - wave superconductors and metals ) and ref .",
    "@xcite ( clean quasi one - dimensional fermi liquids at low @xmath5 ) .    in a galilean invariant system ,",
    "the electrical conductivity is infinite as the current @xmath6 is conserved , where @xmath7 is the momentum and @xmath8 the electron mass . in a crystal , translational",
    "invariance is partially broken which has two consequences .",
    "first , momentum is not conserved anymore as it can be transferred to the underlying lattice in units of the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath9 ( using @xmath10 ) via so - called  umklapp scattering processes  .",
    "a macroscopic momentum will therefore decay .",
    "second , due to band - structure effects , current is not anymore proportional to the momentum .",
    "even processes which conserve momentum can induce a partial decay of the current .",
    "as we elaborate below , non - umklapp processes will lead to a decay of current components perpendicular to the momentum while the parallel component is not affected .",
    "the rather different role of current and momentum is reflected in the disparate frequency and temperature dependence of the optical conductivity . while the @xmath5 dependence of the dc conductivity is often determined by the decay rate of the momentum ( or of the pseudo - momenta introduced in sec.[momenta ] ) , the finite frequency properties reflect that @xmath11 , as we will explain in detail below .    in the following section we will first explore the role of momentum conservation .",
    "we emphasize that momentum has no unique definition in lattice and that the concept of momentum can and should be generalized e.g. in quasi one - dimensional systems or d - wave superconductors .",
    "we will first investigate temperature and then the frequency dependence of the optical conductivity .",
    "in a one - band model , the electrical current is given by @xmath12 where the momentum sum extends over the first brillouin zone ( bz ) and @xmath13 is the velocity of electrons with creation operator @xmath14 and band energy @xmath15 .",
    "while in single band models the current can simply be obtained from a continuity equation , this is not the case in more complex multi - band models where inter - band matrix elements of the current depend on the details of the underlying microscopic model .",
    "as we are only interested in the conductivity at low frequencies and temperatures , we will not discuss such inter - band transitions in the following .",
    "a )  b )  c )    as the velocity is a periodic function of momentum , @xmath16 , the definition of @xmath17 is obviously independent of the choice of the unit - cell in reciprocal space",
    ". this is , however , not the case for the momentum @xmath18 which depends on the chosen ( first ) brillouin zone . for a given definition of @xmath7",
    ", one can separate all scattering events in non - umklapp and umklapp processes , where the latter are defined by a change of the momentum by a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "the choice of the bz will consequently decide whether a given scattering event is an umklapp process as is shown in fig .",
    "as it is common knowledge that in clean systems only umklapp processes contribute to the dc conductivity and as the physics should not depend on the completely arbitrary choice of the bz , one has to ask which definition of the momentum operator is the correct one .",
    "momentum conservation is only important in situations where @xmath7 decays very slowly .",
    "therefore the relevant momentum is the mode with the slowest decay rate .",
    "this can for example be seen within a simple boltzmann equation ( essentially equivalent argument hold also in situations , where a boltzmann description is not possible , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "after linearization , the boltzmann equation in the presence of an electric field @xmath19 takes ( in units where @xmath20 ) the form @xmath21^{-1}_{\\bm k,\\bm k'}v^i_{\\bm k'}\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial \\epsilon_{\\bm k}}\\label{sigma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the ( diagonal ) optical conductivity tensor , @xmath23 the distribution function linearized around the fermi function @xmath24 , and @xmath25 the well - known @xcite scattering matrix . for a diagonal scattering matrix @xmath26 one recovers the celebrated drude formula . for the models considered in this paper , such a relaxation - time approximation can not be applied as certain eigenvectors of @xmath27 have very small eigenvalues .",
    "physicswise , this is a consequence of the approximate conservation of momentum or pseudo momentum ( see below ) .    let us first consider the well - known case of a fermi liquid with a small fermi surface , where umklapp processes are strongly suppressed . in this case",
    "the inverse of the matrix @xmath27 is dominated by a single eigenvector with a very small eigenvalue .",
    "this eigenvector is with high precision the momentum parallel to the current . introducing the scalar product @xmath28",
    ", one finds in such a situation  @xcite @xmath29 where the variational vector @xmath30 takes at the maximum a value proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "we now use ( [ mm ] ) to generalize the concept of momentum and to resolve the above discussed ambiguities related to the choice of the bz .",
    "first of all , momentum conservation ( modulo reciprocal lattice vectors ) is only relevant if the momentum decays much slower than other eigenvectors of @xmath27 .",
    "for example , for a complex three - dimensional fermi surface both umklapp and non - umklapp scattering rates are proportional to @xmath3 and momentum conservation and its generalizations are therefore not important .",
    "second , when defining the momentum , @xmath32 , one should use the bz which results in the _ slowest _ decay rate of @xmath33 or , equivalently , in the largest value on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ mm ] ) .",
    "third , in many situations it is necessary to generalize the concept of momentum by introducing so - called pseudo momenta @xcite as the relevant eigenvector of @xmath27 is not proportional to momentum defined for any choice of the bz .",
    "consider an arbitrary one - particle operator @xmath34 with the time derivative @xmath35 in the presence of an arbitrary density ",
    "density interaction @xmath36 .",
    "we want to construct an operator @xmath37 which ( i ) does not decay by 2-particle processes close to the fermi surface and ( ii ) has a sizeable overlap [ defined by @xmath38 $ ] with the current in @xmath39 direction .",
    "we therefore require that @xmath40 is finite close to the fermi surface while @xmath41 should vanish for low - energy excitations .",
    "for a small fermi surface , the usual momentum has these properties .",
    "if we are able to construct such a quantity in more complicated situations , we will call @xmath37 pseudo momentum.    such a construction is indeed possible when the low - energy excitations cover only a small part of the bz as it is the case e.g. for quasi one - dimensional metals and unconventional superconductors with point or line nodes . for illustration ,",
    "let us define a set of pseudo momenta labeled by the two integers @xmath42 and @xmath8 ( generalizations are possible ) @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the @xmath39 component of a reciprocal lattice vector . for @xmath45",
    "one recovers the standard momentum .",
    "the sign - function @xmath46 implies that for positive / negative @xmath47 the momentum is measured with respect to the line @xmath48 , i.e. the dashed lines in figs  [ fig1]b and c. these pseudo momenta dominate transport if the relevant low - energy excitations are located close to these lines as can be the case in quasi one - dimensional metals or e.g. a two - dimensional d - wave superconductor with nodes close to @xmath49 .    for the quasi one - dimensional fermi surface shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , two types of scattering processes dominate for low @xmath5 .",
    "forward processes of type i conserve momentum and therefore also the pseudo - momentum @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "umklapp processes of type ii transfer the momentum @xmath44 to the lattice : momentum decays rapidly .",
    "but as two particles move from the right to the left fermi surface the pseudo momentum gets an extra contribution @xmath52 and remains conserved .",
    "more precisely , @xmath37 does not decay by two - particle processes , if all four momenta are in the shaded region of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , i.e. @xmath53 . while the momentum is conserved modulo reciprocal lattice vectors , @xmath54 , the pseudo momentum @xmath55 can decay in quanta of size @xmath56 , for example by process iii shown in fig .",
    "such scattering processes are exponentially suppressed even at moderate temperatures .",
    "we conclude that in cases where the low - energy excitations are located in the shaded areas of fig .",
    "[ fig1]b and c , the boltzmann equation predicts for finite @xmath57 an _ exponentially large _",
    "dc - conductivity which has its origin in the approximate conservation of the pseudo - momentum @xmath50 .    the overlap of electrical current and pseudo momentum @xmath57 , see eq .",
    "( [ mm ] ) , is easily calculated within the approximation scheme underlying the boltzmann approach . by partial",
    "integration one obtains @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the total particle density , @xmath60 the density of a filled band . for an exactly half - filled band one",
    "therefore has @xmath61 and conservation of @xmath50 is _ not _ important but dominates transport for small doping away from half - filling . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that these statements also hold beyond perturbation theory even if a simple fermi liquid description is not possible .",
    "how does the presence of an approximately conserved pseudo - momentum affect the optical conductivity ( a more quantitative version of the following arguments can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , a numerical test in ref .",
    "@xcite ) ? consider the following gedanken experiment illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] : prepare a state with a finite current @xmath62 and switch off the driving electric field at time @xmath63 . as the current",
    "is not conserved , it will decay rather fast with a typical rate which we denote by @xmath64 .",
    "the initial state with finite current will typically also have a finite pseudo momentum [ assuming @xmath65 which will decay at a much slower rate than the current ; @xmath66 .",
    "the slow decay of the pseudo - momentum will , as time goes on , induce a slow decay of the current since a state with finite pseudo - momentum will typically carry a finite current as @xmath67 according to our assumptions .",
    "thus , in the long time limit , a finite fraction , @xmath68 , of @xmath69 will not decay with the fast rate @xmath64 but with the much smaller rate @xmath70 as is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( the effect of exact conservation laws has been studied a long time ago by mazur and suzuki @xcite and more recently by zotos and coworkers @xcite ) .",
    "the slow long - time decay of some fraction of the current leads to a corresponding long - time tail in the ( equilibrium ) current - current correlation function .",
    "therefore , one expects a low - frequency peak in the optical conductivity which carries the fraction @xmath68 of the total weight @xmath71 ( a calculation of @xmath72 within fermi liquid theory is given in ref .",
    "the width of the low - frequency peak is determined by the decay - rate of @xmath37 . as the weight of a peak",
    "is approximately given by its width multiplied with its height , we expect that the height and therefore the dc - conductivity is of the order of @xmath73 .",
    "the qualitative analysis of the boltzmann equation sketched above suggests that the dc conductivity of a clean metal is _ exponentially _ large @xcite , @xmath74 , if the fermi surface is either sufficiently small or sufficiently one - dimensional such that a momentum or pseudo - momentum can be found which does not decay by two - particle scattering processes close to the fermi surface . here , the so - called umklapp gap @xmath75 depends on the detailed shape of the fermi surface .",
    "however , it is not difficult to see that the exponential @xmath5 dependence of @xmath0 ( an often cited result going back to peierls @xcite ) is an artifact of a boltzmann equation which considers only two - particle scattering processes . a low - energy scattering process involving @xmath76 particles can  for sufficiently large @xmath76  transfer momentum to the lattice even for small fermi surfaces .",
    "we therefore have to generalize our discussion to @xmath76 particle scattering events . due to conservation of lattice momentum and particle number",
    ", @xmath77 can be altered only by an amount in quanta of size @xmath78 ( for small fermi surfaces use @xmath45 and @xmath79 such that @xmath80 ) .",
    "therefore , a relaxation of @xmath37 is _ not _ possible if all @xmath81 pseudo momenta @xmath82 involved in an @xmath76-particle scattering process are smaller than @xmath83 . for a given fermi surface ,",
    "the decay of @xmath37 by @xmath76-particle collision at low @xmath5 is possible only for @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the maximal distance of the fermi surface from the plane @xmath86 ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) . in the case of a small fermi surface",
    ", @xmath87 is just the fermi momentum .",
    "the @xmath5 dependence of the decay rate of the ( pseudo- ) momentum arising from an @xmath76 particle scattering event can be obtained from the usual phase space arguments : when a particle of energy @xmath88 decays into @xmath89 particle and hole excitations , one of the energies is fixed by energy conservation , and the remaining @xmath90 energies each have a phase - space of order @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , @xmath91 @xmath92 where the integer @xmath76 is the smallest value consistent with ( [ minn ] ) @xcite .",
    "the prefactor of @xmath70 and therefore also the prefactor in ( [ sigmap ] ) depends in a rather delicate way on the strength and range of the interaction , the screening , and the band - curvature , and the prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ sigmap ] ) will be very large for a weakly interacting system and large @xmath76 .",
    "the crossover from a high - temperature regime where 2-particle scattering dominates to low temperatures can crudely be mimicked by an interpolating formula of the type @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is an effective interaction and @xmath75 the umklapp gap for 2-particle collisions .",
    "we want to stress that the analysis given above is valid both for small fermi surfaces and quasi one - dimensional systems with moderate curvature of the fermi surface .",
    "it holds for interactions of arbitrary strength as long as a fermi liquid description is possible . for practical purposes ,",
    "a very clean system is needed to observe a large exponent @xmath76 as otherwise the ( pseudo ) momentum will decay by impurity scattering . in this case , one recovers the usual @xmath3 correction to the resistivity for the lowest @xmath5 , however with a prefactor which depends on the amount of disorder in the system .",
    "in the previous section , we have discussed the @xmath5 dependence of the conductivity for @xmath95 or more precisely @xmath96 where @xmath70 is the decay rate of the momentum at @xmath95 . in this section",
    ", we consider the small - frequency dependence of the @xmath4 conductivity , or more precisely the limit @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the @xmath95 decay rate of the _ current_. we do not investigate the intermediate regime @xmath99 . for simplicity , we also concentrate our discussion on systems with small fermi surfaces to avoid the complications arising from the numerous crossover scales in the quasi one - dimensional system . in the limit @xmath100 , @xmath4 , the frequency dependence of the optical conductivity of a quasi one - dimensional system with finite curvatures of the fermi sheets",
    "is characterized by the same power laws as a generic three - dimensional metal .    for @xmath101 , @xmath4 and in the absence of disorder , it is possible to calculated the optical conductivity from a straightforward perturbative evaluation of the kubo formula .",

    "( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "the simplifications arising at @xmath4 , @xmath101 can be seen by inspecting the ( generalized ) drude formula @xmath103 where @xmath104 is identified with the total optical weight and @xmath105 is the ( frequency - dependent ) scattering rate . for @xmath95 and @xmath106",
    "the conductivity is a singular function of @xmath107 and therefore an infinite resummation of perturbation theory [ e.g. by solving a boltzmann equation or by inverting the matrix in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) ] is required to calculate @xmath0 .",
    "however , in the opposite limit , @xmath101 and @xmath4 , the scattering rate is small compared to @xmath108 allowing for a straightforward perturbative expansion in the small parameter @xmath109 .",

    "@xmath108 only a thin shell of width @xmath132 contributes for each of the three relevant momentum integrations perpendicular to the fermi surface ( the 4th integral takes care of the @xmath111-function arising from energy conservation and the angular integrations are used to fulfill momentum conservation ) .",
    "if we neglect the velocity prefactors , this leads to an @xmath133 dependence of the integrals which cancels the @xmath134 prefactor .",
    "the velocity prefactors @xmath135 can be approximated by constants of the order of @xmath136 , if the fermi surface is sufficiently large such that umklapp scattering processes can take place . in the presence of umklapp , one therefore obtains the well - known result that @xmath137 note that a constant `` incoherent background '' corresponds according to eq .",

    "we first consider two dimensions and study the size of @xmath135 in the limit @xmath100 . for a simple fermi surface ( without pockets etc . ) , momentum conservation in the limit @xmath100 can only be fulfilled by combining opposite momenta , i.e. by choosing @xmath140 and @xmath141 ( or @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) . as @xmath144 the prefactor @xmath135 vanishes",

    "the frequency dependence of the scattering rate has to be contrasted with the temperature dependence discussed in section [ sec2 ] where we found that @xmath162 is dominated by @xmath76-particle scattering processes with @xmath163 for a small fermi surface .",
    "in a generic clean metal , the frequency and temperature dependence of the optical conductivity arise from rather different physical processes and have in general very little in common .",
    "this can be seen most drastically in systems where momentum conservation ( or its generalization the pseudo - momentum conservation ) dominates transport .",
    "in such a situation , we found @xmath164 while @xmath165 where @xmath163 depends on the size of the fermi surface ( or its curvature in the case of a quasi one - dimensional metal ) .",
    "this disparate behavior can be traced back to the simple fact that momentum and current are two different operators in a lattice system .",
    "the response at finite frequencies depends on the relaxation rate of the current operator .",
    "we have shown that in a three - dimensional metal current can relax efficiently even in the absence of umklapp scattering as a typical low - energy scattering process of two particles changes the current by a finite amount @xmath166 .",
    "the same type of process , however , does not relax the momentum .",
    "we have argued that this implies that a finite fraction of the current  the fraction which is parallel to the momentum  does not relax by this process .",
    "the consequence is that such a process is not effective in determining the @xmath95 relaxation rate at finite temperatures .",
    "the @xmath5 dependence of the dc conductivity is given by the relaxation rate of the ( pseudo- ) momentum and therefore a completely different set of processes .",
    "as the @xmath108 and @xmath5 dependence are completely independent for small fermi surfaces or quasi one - dimensional metals , it is obvious that also in the _ presence _ of umklapp scattering , when @xmath167 there is in general no simple relation between the constants @xmath155 and @xmath168 .",
    "we emphasize this fact since in the experimental literature such a relation has sometimes been claimed to exist @xcite but is actually not observed @xcite .    when discussing the role of momentum conservation on the one hand and umklapp scattering on the other hand it is important to keep in mind that in general the concept of momentum is not uniquely well defined in a lattice .",
    "we have emphasized that in general one has to search for a slow mode . in the case of strongly anisotropic fermi liquids ( or luttinger liquids",
    "@xcite , spin chains and ladders @xcite or superconductors @xcite with point nodes ) this has motivated us to consider so - called pseudo - momenta , see eq .",
    "( [ pseudo ] ) , which can be identified with the momenta of effective low - energy field theories @xcite .",
    "more than a century after the pioneering work of drude the measurement and calculation of the optical conductivity remains an interesting and challenging area of condensed matter physics .",
    "open questions include for example the transport close to quantum - critical points where the role of momentum conservation and umklapp scattering deserves further investigations .",
    "but even in simple fermi liquids it is interesting  both experimentally and theoretically  to study the precise shape of the drude peak in regimes where impurity scattering can be neglected , especially in quasi one - dimensional metals @xcite .",
