    "magnetic systems in the presence of random field are an important class of disordered systems which have been extensively studied for last many years .",
    "these systems are governed by two energies : the exchange interaction between spins which want spins to be correlated and local random field @xmath2 at each site which would make the spins uncorrelated .",
    "thermal frustrations play a secondary role in random field models , since their disordering effect is much weaker @xcite .",
    "one of the very well studied model to understand the effect of random field is the random field ising model ( rfim ) , which was introduced by imry and ma in 1975 @xcite . the pure model ( ising model )",
    "has a continuous transition for all @xmath10 .",
    "the model has been very useful as it has found its physical realizations in many of the condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "hence the model has attracted a lot of attention , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the model has many interesting and intriguing properties .",
    "for example , at the mean field level the phase - diagram of rfim is known to change its character as a function of the random field distribution function . for gaussian distribution",
    ", the transition stays continuous for all strengths of the random field , but for bimodal distribution it exhibits a tricritical point @xcite . in three dimensions though the existence of tricritical point has been widely debated @xcite , with recent numerical simulations suggesting continuous transition even in the strong disorder regime@xcite .",
    "related model is a @xmath0-spin model , in which @xmath0-spins are connected by an exchange interaction @xcite .",
    "pure system has a sharp first order transition for @xmath8 , which can easily be studied in the mean field limit .",
    "the random field version of this model , for @xmath8 , has relatively attracted much less attention in the literature .",
    "this model is a good system to study the effect of local field randomness on sharp first order transitions @xcite .",
    "the model is also of relevance since it is known to have connections with the structural glasses @xcite .",
    "effect of quenched local randomness for systems which undergo continuous phase transition in the absence of randomness is well described by the harris criterion @xcite .",
    "this is possible due to the universal behaviour of the correlation length . on the other hand , even though first order transitions are common in nature , effect of random local disorder on first order transitions is much harder to study theoretically , as the correlation length remains finite and hence the universal behaviour is not expected in these systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we look at the random field @xmath0-spin model on fully connected graphs using the theory of large deviations .",
    "large deviations lend itself naturally to the study of mean field statistical mechanics models @xcite . recently , lowe et al @xcite derived the rate function ( to be defined in section 2 ) for the magnetisation of random field ising model on fully connected graphs using a method based on tilted large deviation techniques @xcite .",
    "their method is much simpler than the earlier approaches @xcite and can easily be generalised to many other random field problems . in this paper , we extend it to solve the random field @xmath0-spin model for arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "note that even though calculations are a straightforward generalisation of @xcite , they are useful as they allow us to study the random @xmath0-spin model fully and hence allow us to look into the issue of understanding the disorder effects near the first order transitions .",
    "besides obtaining the phase diagram in this paper , we also derive a method to obtain the value of quantities like magnetic susceptibility from the rate function .",
    "magnetic susceptibility is an experimentally measurable quantity , and hence is useful to make direct connection with the experimental observations .",
    "we find that in the first order regime of rfim , magnetic susceptibility is a rapidly increasing function of the temperature as one approaches the critical point , even though it does not diverge at the transition point . for @xmath8 ,",
    "it is discontinuous at the transition point , with a typical paramagnetic behaviour in the high temperature phase .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec2 ] , we give the details of the model and calculate the rate function .",
    "we also derive the expression for magnetic susceptibility in this section . in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "we give the phase - diagram obtained by looking at the value of magnetisation , and in section [ sec4 ] , we calculate the magnetic susceptibility for @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "we consider a hamiltonian of the form :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 are ising spins which take values @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the uniform external field and @xmath17 is the site dependent random field taken from a distribution .",
    "the probability of getting a particular configuration @xmath18 for a given realization of @xmath19 is given by :    @xmath20    where , @xmath21 is the partition function of the model for a given realization @xmath19 of the random field and @xmath22 is the inverse of the temperature . in order to get the free energy",
    ", one needs to average the @xmath23 of the partition function over the distribution of random fields .",
    "this averaging over the @xmath23 is a hard problem , and has been done only for a relatively fewer models like the random energy model @xcite .",
    "another approach is the replica approach where the @xmath24 is approximated by the use of the identity @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "one more method which has been found useful to study the mean field spin systems is the large deviation technique .",
    "one can prove the existence of large deviation principle with an explicit rate function for the order parameter of the model and then use it to study the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "recently , for random field ising model ( @xmath1 ) , lowe et al @xcite derived the rate function explictly for the probability distribution of magnetisation . for a sequence of random variables",
    "@xmath26 , the rate function is defined as    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the probability that the given sequence of random variables ( @xmath26 ) , belong to the set @xmath29 . for our model",
    ", @xmath29 can be defined via @xmath30 , _ i.e. _ , all sequences with same value of @xmath31 will have the same probability , as given by the equation above .",
    "note that trying to get the rate function directly , using say gartner ellis theorem @xcite , is quite complicated as @xmath32 is not a sum of @xmath33 independent random variables with respect to the probability measure in eq .",
    "[ eqn_gibbs_measure ] . in order to calculate the rate function lowe et",
    "al @xcite developed a method which mainly involved the following steps :    \\1 .",
    "prove large deviation principle ( ldp ) with respect to a measure @xmath34 , which is a measure on non - interacting spins and hence is easier to average over the quenched field .",
    "use titled ldp to calculate the rate function for the probability distribution of magnetisation in the presence of coupling term from the rate function of @xmath34 .",
    "this method turns out to be very useful especially in the cases where the randomness is not in the the coupling term .",
    "also it gives the full rate function for the probability distribution of the magnetisation , unlike earlier approaches @xcite .",
    "since the average over the spin variables is done over the @xmath34 measure , the method extends straightforwardly to arbitrary @xmath0 for any discrete spin and for any distribution of the random fields .",
    "this is unlike other approaches which for @xmath35 , were doable only for the spherical spins@xcite .",
    "let @xmath36 , for every @xmath37 , be the probability measure on @xmath38 induced by the field @xmath39 .",
    "then @xmath40    we denote by @xmath41 , the product measure @xmath42 , which is a probability measure on @xmath43 .",
    "we first calculate an ldp with respect to @xmath41 .",
    "we can employ gartner ellis theorem for the sum , @xmath44 , as it is a sum of independent random variables under the product measure @xmath41 .",
    "gartner - ellis theorem yields that @xmath45 satisfies ldp with respect to @xmath41 , with a rate function @xmath46 , where @xmath47 now because of the strong law of large numbers , we have @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the expectation value with respect to the distribution of the random fields . for the bimodal distribution of the random field @xmath50 , given by @xmath51,\\ ] ]",
    "the function @xmath49 comes out to be @xmath52.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence we get , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the legendre - fenchel transform of @xmath49 , @xmath55 now @xmath56 , the probability that the sum @xmath57 for a given @xmath22 , @xmath2 and @xmath16 , can be writtem in terms of @xmath41 as follows : @xmath58 where , @xmath59 the tilted ldp @xcite then yields that @xmath45 satisfies a ldp with respect to @xmath56 with the rate function given by @xmath60 let @xmath61.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the function @xmath62 attains maximum at @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "hence the rate function in eq.([eqn_p2_random_rate ] ) becomes @xmath66 where , @xmath67 at a given value of @xmath68 and @xmath16 , the value of magnetisation @xmath69 , which is the average value of @xmath70 , averaged over all spin configurations , will be given by that value of @xmath31 at which @xmath71 is minimum .",
    "hence magnetisation is given by that solution of the equation @xmath72 , which minimises @xmath71 .",
    "rate function defined by eq .",
    "[ eqn_p2_random_rate_final ] , has one local minimum at @xmath73 in the paramagnetic phase and develops multiple minima in the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "this rate function actually looks very similar to the landau free energy functional ( see fig .",
    "[ ratef ] ) .",
    "this is not a priori obvious due to the presence of random field . expanding eq .",
    "[ eqn_p2_random_rate_final ] in powers of @xmath31 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 , gives the following expressions for @xmath1 , @xmath76 and @xmath12 respectively :    @xmath77    @xmath78    and    @xmath79    as expected , the expansion of @xmath80 in the absence of randomness gives the landau free energy functional of the curie weiss model .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath8 , even in the pure case , the @xmath22 dependence is no longer with the lowest power of @xmath31 .",
    "since the expansion is not really useful to get the behaviour near the first order transition ( for which we need to keep terms till all orders ) , we will not use this method to study the phase diagram of the problem in the presence of randomness .",
    "the full rate function contains much more information than just the value of magnetisation .",
    "we can easily use it to extract the magnetic susceptibility of the system .",
    "magnetic susceptibility is the response of the system to external magnetic field ( @xmath81 ) .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the nature of phase transition of @xmath0-spin random field model is qualitatively different for @xmath1 and for @xmath35 . for @xmath82 ,",
    "the random field model has been solved for spherical spins earlier @xcite .",
    "we solve it here for ising spins , and find that for all @xmath4 , for high enough strength of the random field , ising spins do not order into a ferromagnetic phase , even at zero temperature . magnetic susceptibility for these strengths of fields",
    "also shows a non monotonic behaviour , peaking at a finite @xmath22 .",
    "the method can be used starightforwardly to study other random distributions , though for @xmath8 , we do not expect any qualitative difference in the behaviour of the model for different distributions .",
    "we also notice that the nature of fluctuations near the transition point is different for the first order transition when @xmath1 , from that of @xmath8 . for @xmath1",
    "there exists a range of @xmath2 for which even though the system undergoes a first order transition , @xmath83 increases rapidly as one approaches the transition",
    ". it would be interesting to see if the similar behaviour continues in finite dimensions . in three dimension ,",
    "rfim is known to have strong finite size effects which makes it difficult to acertain the nature of transition for the higher strengths of the random field @xcite . besides that , eq . [ eqn_p2_random_rate_final ] can also give us some indications for writing down the correct field theory for the model , which in turn could be useful in understanding the behaviour of randomness near a first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "it should also be possible to extend the method to study the effect of random field in other models like potts and blume - capel model @xcite .",
