    "top quark is an excellent probe for the new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , since it is the heaviest particle discovered so far , with a mass close to the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking scale .",
    "direct evidence for new physics at tev scale may be not easy to find , while indirect evidence , such as modification of sm predictions originated from new physics interaction , are important as well .",
    "a good consideration is to investigate single top quark production process via the anomalous flavor - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) coupling .",
    "the fcnc couplings are absent at the tree level , and occur through loop diagrams within the sm , which are further suppressed by the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani ( gim ) mechanism  @xcite .",
    "therefore , within the sm , single top quark fcnc production is expected to have tiny cross section , and is probably unmeasurable at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "however , the single top quark production induced by the fcnc coupling can be enhanced significantly in some new physics models  @xcite .",
    "top quark will be copiously produced at the lhc ( about @xmath10 per year ) , even in the initial low luminosity run ( @xmath11/year ) @xmath12 top quark pairs and @xmath13 single top quarks will be produced yearly . with such large samples , precise measurements of single top quark production will be available and provide a good opportunity to discover the first hint of new physics by observing the fcnc couplings in the top quark sector .    in this paper , we study the single top quark associated with @xmath0 production induced by fcnc couplings in a model - independent way by using the effective lagrangian . the relevant effective lagrangian up to dimension @xmath14 consists of the following operators  @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the new physics scale , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the field strength tensors of photon and gluon respectively , and @xmath19 are the conventional gell - mann matrices .",
    "@xmath20 are real and positive , while @xmath21 and @xmath22 are complex numbers satisfying @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "present experimental constraints for the @xmath1 fcnc couplings come from the non - observation of the decays @xmath26 at tevatron and the absence of the single top production @xmath27 at hera .",
    "the cdf collaboration has set @xmath28 confidence level ( cl ) limits on the branching fractions @xmath29",
    "@xcite , which corresponds to @xmath30 based on the theoretical predictions of @xmath31 at the next - to - leading order(nlo ) level in qcd  @xcite .",
    "the zeus collaboration also provides a more stringent constraints , @xmath32 at a @xmath28 cl , through the measurements of @xmath33  @xcite using the nlo predictions  @xcite , which can be transferred to @xmath34 .",
    "recently , the most stringent experimental constraints for the @xmath2 fcnc couplings are @xmath35 and @xmath36 given by the d0 collaboration  @xcite , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 given by the cdf collaboration  @xcite , based on the measurements of the fcnc single top production using the theoretical predictions , including the nlo qcd corrections  @xcite and resummation effects  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the observation of @xmath39 process is a clear signal of top quark fcnc interactions , which can be induced by @xmath1 and @xmath2 couplings , since there is no irreducible backgrounds of this process in the sm .",
    "there are already several literatures  @xcite discussing this process using effective lagrangian eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) .",
    "however they were either based on the lo calculations , or the nlo qcd effects are not completely calculated .",
    "so it is necessary to present a complete nlo corrections to the above process , which is not only mandatory for matching the expected experimental accuracy at hadron colliders , but is also important for a consistent treatment of both the top quark production and decay via the fcnc couplings by experiments .    in this paper , we present the complete nlo qcd corrections to the top quark associated with @xmath0 production via @xmath1 and @xmath2 fcnc couplings with their mixing effects at hadron colliders .",
