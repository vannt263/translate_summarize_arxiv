    "current surveys for brown dwarfs are exploring new regimes of temperature , mass , metallicity , age , binarity , and formation environment in order to address a variety of questions regarding objects at low masses and cold temperatures .",
    "for instance , brown dwarfs at low masses constrain the minimum mass of the initial mass function while the youngest brown dwarfs in the protostellar phase offer the most direct insight into the formation process of substellar objects .",
    "the taurus star - forming region ( @xmath1  myr , @xmath2  pc ) has been the target of two recent surveys for low - mass brown dwarfs and protostellar brown dwarfs .",
    "@xcite searched for the former by obtaining near - infrared ( ir ) images of a large sample of molecular cores in taurus and combining these data with optical photometry from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the overlapping area of 1  deg@xmath3 between the ir and optical images",
    ", @xcite identified five new brown dwarf candidates and performed spectroscopy on two of them to assess their nature . using these spectra , they classified one of the candidates , caha  tau  1 , as a young brown dwarf with a spectral type of l2 , which would make it the coolest ( and likely least massive ) known member of taurus @xcite .    in another survey of taurus",
    ", @xcite used archival mid - ir images from the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite to search for protostellar brown dwarfs .",
    "they reported the discovery of a @xmath4 pair of candidates that could comprise a binary system , which were designated as sstb213 j041757.75 + 274105.5 a and b ( henceforth j041757  a and b ) . although spectroscopy was unavailable for these objects",
    ", @xcite concluded that the proper motion of the a component supports its membership in taurus and that the colors of the b component are inconsistent with a galaxy , which is the primary source of contamination in a survey for protostellar brown dwarfs .",
    "we have performed ir spectroscopy on caha  tau  1 and j041757  a to determine whether they are young brown dwarfs .",
    "we also have used the available colors and proper motion measurements for these two objects and the remaining candidates from @xcite and @xcite to determine if they are likely to be substellar members of taurus .",
    "we obtained low - resolution near - ir spectra of caha  tau  1 and j041757  a with spex @xcite at the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) .",
    "we used the prism mode of spex with a @xmath5 slit , which provided a wavelength coverage of 0.8 - 2.5  and a resolution of @xmath6 .",
    "we collected 12 and 16 exposures of caha  tau  1 on the nights of 2010 january 3 and 4 , respectively , and 20 exposures of j041757  a on the night of 2010 january 16 .",
    "the images had exposure times of 90  s and were taken during dither sequences between two positions along the slit .",
    "the observations of caha  tau  1 were performed with the slit rotated to the parallactic angle . for j041757  a , we aligned the slit so that it encompassed the a and b sources simultaneously .",
    "spectra that are not obtained at the parallactic angle are susceptible to wavelength - dependent slit losses , but such losses should be negligible for the observations of j041757 since they were performed at a very low airmass ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "these data were reduced with the spextool package @xcite and corrected for telluric absorption @xcite .",
    "the average signal - to - noise ratios were @xmath8 and 12 per pixel for caha  tau  1 and j041757  a , respectively .",
    "we smoothed the reduced spectra to a slightly lower resolution ( @xmath9 ) to improve these ratios .",
    "the resulting spectra for caha  tau  1 and j041757  a are presented in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "a small portion of the spectrum of j041757  a is not shown because it falls between the atmospheric windows where the telluric correction was very poor .",
    "the detection of j041757  b was too weak for a useful spectrum .",
    "using ir spectroscopy , @xcite classified caha  tau  1 as a young brown dwarf with a spectral type of l2@xmath100.5 .",
    "if j041757  a is a member of taurus , @xcite estimated that it should have a temperature of 15501750  k based on a comparison of its photometry to the fluxes predicted by theoretical evolutionary models , which also corresponds to an l spectral type @xcite . to assess the accuracy of these classifications ,",
    "we begin by comparing our spectra of caha  tau  1 and j041757  a in figure  [ fig : spec ] to a spectrum of one of the coolest known members of taurus , kpno  4 ( m9.5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which has been reddened to roughly match the spectral slopes of the two candidates .",
    "the most prominent features in the spectrum of kpno  4 are the deep h@xmath11o absorption bands .",
    "caha  tau  1 and j041757  a should show h@xmath11o bands that are as strong or stronger as those in kpno  4 if they are l - type members of taurus , but this is not the case . instead ,",
    "caha  tau  1 exhibits weak h@xmath11o absorption that is indicative of a spectral type of m5m6 if it is a dwarf and m3m4 if it is a young staro absorption is stronger in pre - main - sequence objects than in dwarfs at a given optical spectral type @xcite . ] .",
    "the absence of detectable h@xmath11o absorption in the spectrum of j041757  a places constraints of @xmath12m2 ( dwarf ) and @xmath12m0 ( young ) on the spectral type .",
    "the near - ir absorption features from the photospheres of young stars can be diluted by continuum veiling from circumstellar dust emission , but this is not a possible explanation for the absence of strong h@xmath11o absorption for caha  tau  1 and j041757  a since they do not exhibit ir excess emission ( section  [ sec : mid ] ) .",
    "both candidates are much too faint to be members of taurus with spectral types of m3m4 and @xmath12m0 .",
    "thus , we classify them as background stars rather than substellar members of taurus .",
    "in addition to spectroscopy , we have used the available photometry to examine whether the candidates from @xcite and @xcite are likely to be young brown dwarfs .",
    "we have retrieved photometry in the five optical bands of sdss ( @xmath13 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from the sixth data release of the survey @xcite for caha  tau  15 and j041757  a ( the b component was not detected by sdss ) . the calibration of these images is described by @xcite .",
    "we selected the data measured with an aperture radius of @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite measured @xmath15 and @xmath16 photometry for j041757  a and b from archival images from the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "the data for j041757  a from @xcite agree with those from sdss , which suggests that the two photometric systems are similar .",
    "therefore , we have adopted the @xmath15 and @xmath16 photometry from @xcite for j041757  b.    we have compiled photometry at @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 from the two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for caha  tau  1 , 2 , 4 , and 5 , from @xcite for caha  tau  3 , and from @xcite for j041757  a and b. all of these sources also appear within archival images at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 , and 24  that were obtained by the _ spitzer space telescope_. we have measured photometry from these images using the methods that were applied to the known members of taurus by @xcite .",
    "j041757  b becomes increasingly dominant over j041757  a at longer wavelengths , as shown in figure  [ fig : sub ] . to measure photometry at 3.6 and 4.5  for j041757  a , we subtracted a scaled point spread function ( psf ) at the location of j041757  b @xcite .",
    "the a component was not detected in the psf - subtracted images at 5.8 and 8.0  .",
    "the spatial resolution of the image at 24  is too low for resolving j041757  a and b. we have assigned all of the 24  flux to j041757  b since it is much redder than j041757  a at 3.68.0  .",
    "we have adopted the average measurement in a given band if an object was observed at multiple epochs by _",
    "spitzer_. we did not measure photometry from the second epoch of images at 3.6  for j041757  a and b because they were contaminated by cosmic rays .",
    "our measurements of _ spitzer _ photometry for caha  tau  15 and j041757  a and b are presented in table  [ tab : phot ] .      to determine if the candidates from @xcite and @xcite have the appropriate optical colors and magnitudes for low - mass members of taurus , we plot them on a diagram of @xmath15 versus @xmath20 in figure  [ fig : col ] with all known late - type members of taurus ( @xmath21m6 ) that were detected by sdss .",
    "we include in that diagram all other point sources in the sdss images that have photometric uncertainties less than 0.1  mag .",
    "all of the candidates appear below the sequence of known members , which indicates that they are probably field stars or galaxies .",
    "caha  tau 2 , 4 , and 5 were detected in the survey by @xcite and were identified as probable nonmembers for the same reason .",
    "one additional candidate , caha  tau  3 , was encompassed by the images from @xcite , but its signal - to - noise ratio was too low for useful photometry .",
    "young stars that are occulted by circumstellar disks and seen in scattered light can appear anomalously faint for their colors , but j041757  b is the only candidate that shows possible evidence of a disk in its mid - ir photometry ( section  [ sec : mid ] ) .",
    "a diagram of @xmath22 versus @xmath23 is useful for distinguishing between late - type objects and reddened stars at earlier types @xcite .",
    "we show a diagram of this kind in figure  [ fig : col ] for the candidates from @xcite and @xcite , the known late - type members of taurus , and all other sources with errors less than 0.1  mag in the sdss and 2mass images of taurus .",
    "caha  tau  2 is the only candidate that has the appropriate colors for a young object later than m6 .",
    "given its position in @xmath15 versus @xmath20 , it is probably a field m dwarf rather than a low - mass member of taurus .      approximately half of the known brown dwarfs in taurus exhibit red mid - ir colors that indicate the presence of circumstellar disks @xcite .",
    "we can check for this signature of youth in the mid - ir photometry for the candidate brown dwarfs from @xcite and @xcite . according to our _ spitzer _ measurements in table  [ tab : phot ] , caha  tau  15 and j041757  a have neutral colors ( @xmath24 ) that agree with those of stellar photospheres , and",
    "thus do not show evidence of disks .",
    "the remaining candidate , j041757  b , does have a very red ir spectral energy distribution , which was the basis of its original identification as a candidate protostellar brown dwarf by @xcite .",
    "as demonstrated in that study , the mid - ir colors of j041757  b are similar to those of known protostars in taurus .    based on a comparison to extragalactic surveys with _ spitzer _ , @xcite concluded that a single type of galaxy could not account for all of the mid - ir colors of j041757  b. however , we find that the _ spitzer _ colors of this object are fully consistent with those of active galactic nuclei ( agn , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : irac ] , where we show two _ spitzer _ color - color diagrams for j041757  b and a sample of sources that have been spectroscopically classified as agns @xcite from the _ spitzer _ wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "elaisc15 j003603 - 433152 is an example of an agn from swire whose _ spitzer _ colors agree closely ( @xmath25  mag ) with those of j041757",
    "b. we also include in figure  [ fig : irac ] all sources detected in _ spitzer _ images of taurus that have @xmath26>11",
    "$ ] , photometric errors less than 0.1  mag in all bands , and are not known members of the star - forming region @xcite .",
    "this sample contains @xmath27 objects and should be dominated by background sources , mostly agn and other red galaxies .",
    "the mid - ir colors of j041757  b place it within this background population as well .",
    "after examining the colors of j041757  b at optical and near - ir wavelengths , @xcite found that it is redder than galaxies from extragalactic surveys like swire in @xmath28 and @xmath29 $ ] , leading them to conclude that it is not a galaxy .",
    "however , as shown in figure  6 from @xcite , the colors of j041757  b are consistent with a galaxy reddened by @xmath30 , and the presence of extinction is naturally explained by the taurus dark cloud against which j041757  b is projected . indeed , the shape of the spectrum of j041757  a , which is a background star near the same line of sight , exhibits a reddening that corresponds to @xmath31 .",
    "the dust map from @xcite indicates a similar extinction at this position , although its spatial resolution is low ( fwhm=@xmath32 ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite measured proper motions for their candidates and compared these data to proper motions of known taurus members to assess whether they are likely to be members . in this section , we examine the proper motion analysis from each of those studies .",
    "@xcite found that the proper motions of caha tau  1 and 2 agreed with those of the known members of taurus .",
    "however , the motions of the two candidates differed by only 1.3 and 1.9  @xmath33 , respectively , from a simulated population of background giants because of the large proper motion uncertainties . according to @xcite ,",
    "the sizes of the motions of caha tau  1 and 2 were also consistent with those expected for field dwarfs .",
    "indeed , we classified caha tau  1 as a m6 dwarf based on our spectroscopy in section  [ sec : class ] .",
    "@xcite concluded that the uncertainties in the proper motions for the remaining candidates , caha tau  35 , were too large for useful constraints on their membership .",
    "@xcite compared their proper motion measurements for j041757  a and b to the mean and standard deviation of the motions of known taurus members that were computed by @xcite . based on this comparison",
    ", they concluded that j041757  a is a member of taurus while the data for j041757  b are inconclusive .",
    "however , the proper motion data from @xcite are inadequate for identifying likely members in this manner because they include a large number of off - cloud stars that may be unrelated to taurus , which results in a proper motion dispersion that is erroneously large .",
    "when a more reliable census of taurus members is considered , the mean proper motion and radial velocities of the taurus subgroups indicate that the variation among the velocity vectors of the subgroups is rather small ( @xmath1011.5  kms@xmath34 , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , to assess the statistical likelihood of membership for j041757  a and b , we compare their proper motions to the mean motion of the nearest taurus subgroup ( ii ) : @xmath35 , @xmath36 mas / yr @xcite . we assume that the absolute proper motions of j041757  a and b are the same as the relative values measured by @xcite : @xmath37 = @xmath38 , @xmath39 mas / yr for a and @xmath40 , @xmath41 mas / yr for b. when we account for the proper motion errors and the uncertainty in the mean motion of the taurus ii subgroup , and we assume a one - dimensional velocity dispersion of 1  kms@xmath34 ( 1.5 mas  yr@xmath34 ) for bona fide subgroup members , we find that @xmath427% and 3@xmath4310@xmath44% of bona fide members of taurus ii would have motions more deviant than that of j041757  a and b , respectively .",
    "thus , we conclude that the motion of j041757  a is just within @xmath422@xmath33 of the mean motion of the subgroup , but the motion of j041757  b is clearly inconsistent with membership .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath4220% of objects with no proper motion should exhibit measurable proper motions larger than that of j041757  b. thus , the proper motion constraint for j041757  b is statistically consistent with the zero motion expected for a galaxy .",
    "we have used ir spectra , optical and ir colors , and proper motion measurements to examine whether caha  tau  15 @xcite and j041757  a and b @xcite are substellar members of the taurus star - forming region .",
    "we have obtained spectra of two of these sources , caha  tau  1 and j041757  a. the absence of strong steam absorption in their spectra indicates that they are not young brown dwarfs .",
    "we classify caha  tau  1 and j041757  a as reddened background stars with spectral types of m5m6 and @xmath12m2 , respectively .",
    "all of the candidates from @xcite and @xcite appear below the sequence of known members of taurus on an optical color - magnitude diagram , indicating that they are field stars or galaxies .",
    "one of these sources , caha  tau  2 , has @xmath23 and @xmath45 colors that are consistent with a late spectral type ( @xmath21m6 ) , but it is probably a field dwarf given its position in the optical color - magnitude diagram .",
    "six of the candidates do not show excess emission from disks in their mid - ir colors .",
    "the remaining source , j041757  b , has a red spectral energy distribution that is consistent with both a protostar and an agn .",
    "@xcite concluded that this object is too red in @xmath28 and @xmath29 $ ] to be a galaxy , but the reddening of these colors relative to galaxies at high latitudes is easily explained by the taurus dark cloud along its line of sight .",
    "the available proper motion measurements for caha  tau  15 do not provide strong constraints on their membership in taurus .",
    "we estimate a membership probability of 7% for j041757  a by comparing its proper motion to those of known taurus members .",
    "the motion of this object is consistent with a field dwarf , which is how we classify it spectroscopically .",
    "the proper motion constraints for j041757  b are inconsistent with membership in taurus and agree with the absence of motion expected for a galaxy . based on these various data ,",
