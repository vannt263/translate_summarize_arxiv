    "the radial surface brightness profiles of galaxy stellar disks are usually assumed to be exponential in nature , though it is by no means obvious that a galaxy disk _ should _ have an exponential profile .",
    "one of the more successful early attempts to show that an exponential disk could form naturally was by @xcite , who found that an exponential disk forms if the time scales for viscosity and the star formation are comparable ; more recent studies along these lines include @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although early attempts to derive exponential disks from first principles in cosmological simulations yielded disks with excess brightness in the inner profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , more recent experiments in which star formation was taken at least partially into account have been more successful @xcite .",
    "even so , the exponentiality of the radial brightness profile is perhaps best treated as an empirical datum .    in his pioneering paper on galaxy disks , @xcite pointed out that not all disks are simple exponentials .",
    "in particular , he identified two basic types of disk profiles : type i , in which the disk _ does _ in fact show a simple exponential form ; and type ii , where the outer part of the disk shows a purely exponential fall - off , but where the inner part of the profile falls below the inward projection of the outer exponential .",
    "( in both cases , the profile usually rises more steeply in the innermost part of the galaxy ; this is typically assumed to represent the contribution of the central bulge . )",
    "although it has been argued that type ii profiles are simply an illusion generated by excessive dust extinction at certain radii @xcite , so that the actual _ stellar _ profile is still type i , the very existence of type ii profiles in s0 galaxies tends to discount this explanation .",
    "@xcite combined optical and near - ir imaging to show that dust extinction is responsible for only a subset of type ii profiles in intermediate and late - type spirals .",
    "another feature which is sometimes taken to be a general ( or even universal ) property of disks is that of a _ truncation _ of the stellar population at large radii , typically 24 exponential scale lengths ( see , e.g. , the review by * ? ? ?",
    "van der kruit ( 1979 ) and @xcite first drew attention to this phenomenon , which they inferred primarily from the major - axis profiles of edge - on , late - type spirals .",
    "the term `` truncation '' is perhaps misleading , since even the original studies did not argue for a complete absence of stars beyond the truncation radius .",
    "more recently , @xcite used deep images of three face - on spirals to show that the truncation actually takes the form of a change in slope , from the shallow exponential of the main disk to a steeper exponential at larger radii ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "from this perspective , truncations can be seen as another form of freeman s type ii profile , with breaks at fainter surface brightness levels than was typical of freeman s original sample .",
    "theoretical models have ascribed truncations to a feature of the initial collapsing cloud which formed the disk @xcite , or to the effects of a star formation threshold due to changes in the gas density or phase at large radii @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have put forward viscous evolutionary disk models which produce truncation - like features , though the latter authors argue that their truncations would tend to smooth away during the evolution of the galaxy .",
    "the influence of magnetic fields has also been proposed to account for the truncated form of disk edges @xcite , and recent @xmath6-body simulations by @xcite suggest that purely stellar - dynamical effects could be a plausible mechanism .",
    "most of those working on explantations for truncations have implicitly assumed that all disks , or at least the great majority , are truncated .",
    "however , this appears not to be the case .",
    "at least some spirals show a single exponential brightness profile traceable out to eight or even ten scale lengths from the center , with no sign of truncation ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "evidence for a _ third _ general class of disk profiles has been presented by @xcite for early - type disks and by @xcite and @xcite for late - type disks ; an earlier identification of this phenomenon in extreme late - type spirals is that of @xcite . in this class ,",
    "dubbed `` type iii '' ( or `` antitruncation '' ) by erwin et al . , the inner profile is a relatively steep exponential , which gives way to a _",
    "shallower _ surface brightness profile ( which may or may not be exponential itself ) beyond the break radius . this profile is thus something like the inverse of a type ii profile , bending `` up '' instead of `` down '' beyond the break radius .",
    "@xcite showed that something like a type  iii profile could result from star formation if the initial gas disk has the right ( ad - hoc ) radial density profile ; more recently , @xcite argued that minor mergers can produce type  iii profiles .",
    "stellar disks thus seem to be a mixed and somewhat confusing bag : some disks are exponential out to very large radii , some are apparently truncated , some display classical freeman type ii profiles ( if these are indeed really distinct from truncations ) , and some have shallower profiles beyond a certain radius . this diversity is probably telling us something important about galaxy formation and evolution  for example , the outer part of the disk may record useful information about past accretion and interactions or the lack thereof ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it would clearly be useful , however , to have a better understanding of just how often , where , and in what fashion disks deviate from the simple exponential model .",
    "this paper is part of a larger study focused on the outer disks of s0 and early - type spiral galaxies , complementing the study of late - type disks by @xcite .",
    "our aim is to map out some of the actual complexity in galaxy disk profiles , look for patterns and order within this complexity , establish a general taxonomy for disk profiles , and ultimately attempt to understand _ why _ disk profiles behave the way they do . along the way , we hope to test some recent models of star formation in galaxy disks , and lay the groundwork for more general testing of disk galaxy formation models .    here , we present surface brightness profiles and classifications for a sample of 66 s0sb galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are the _ barred _ subset of our early - type sample ( a total of 118 galaxies ) ; the data and analysis for the unbarred galaxies will be presented in a subsequent paper @xcite .",
    "we concentrate first on the barred galaxies  which are the majority of the sample  because they have a unique and useful characteristic : the bar can be used as a measuring rod . as we will show below and",
    "in @xcite , the bar size provides a useful and informative way to analyze type ii profiles in particular , and there are hints of strong connections between the bars and the disk profiles .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the galaxy sample , the imaging observations made , a brief description of the data taken from archives , and the reduction and photometric calibration of the images . in section 3 we explain how we obtained the radial surface - brightness profiles of the galaxies , the comparison of the profiles made with data from different telescopes , and the quality of the profiles taken from sloan digital sky survey images .",
    "section 4 presents the detailed classification scheme for the surface brightness profiles , with illustrative examples . finally ,",
    "in section 5 we show individual profiles for all the galaxies and supply explanatory notes for individual galaxies .",
    "our sample is essentially the same as that presented in @xcite , which in turn was an expansion of a sample originally studied by @xcite .",
    "the expanded sample consists of all galaxies from the uppsala general catalog @xcite which are nearby ( heliocentric redshift @xmath7 km  s@xmath8 ) , northern ( @xmath9 ) , and large ( diameters @xmath10 ) , with hubble types s0sb , and strong or weak bars ( sb or sab bar types from * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter rc3 ) .",
    "because of uncertainties about how consistent hubble types for spirals are between the virgo cluster and the field ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we excluded virgo cluster spirals ( but retained the s0 galaxies ) .",
    "we also removed nine galaxies which did not appear to have bars , despite their sb or sab classification , or which were involved in strong interactions ; see @xcite .",
    "the trimmed sample has a total of 66 galaxies .",
    "this is one more than the sample presented in @xcite because inspection of an @xmath11-band image from the galaxy on line database milano network @xcite shows that ngc  4531 _ is _ in fact barred , though erwin had described it as unbarred based on available optical images .",
    "the galaxies and their global properties are listed in table  [ tab : basic ] .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the sample is restricted to barred galaxies . because we include galaxies with both strong and weak bars , we cover at least two - thirds of local disk galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also have images for the corresponding _ unbarred _ galaxy sample , which are currently being analyzed @xcite .",
    "details of their surface - brightness profiles and similarities with ( or differences from ) the barred galaxies will be discussed in future papers @xcite .",
    "the field s0sa galaxies in our sample were previously studied by erwin & sparke ( 2002 , 2003 ) , who imaged almost all of them in @xmath12 and @xmath0 with the 3.5 m wiyn telescope .",
    "subsequently most of the sab and sb galaxies , as well as the virgo s0 galaxies , were imaged in @xmath12 and @xmath0 with the andalucia faint object spectrograph and camera ( alfosc ) on the nordic optical telescope ( not ) in 2001 and 2002 .    unfortunately , the majority of these images turned out not to be useful for the present study , for two reasons .",
    "first , the small fields of view of the imagers ( @xmath13 for wiyn and @xmath14 for not / alfosc ) meant that the outer disks of many of our galaxies filled most of the ccds .",
    "we have found that light from the stellar disks can often be traced to at least _ twice _ the rc3 @xmath15 diameter . since all of our galaxies have , due to the way the sample is defined , @xmath16 , each galaxy s disk thus extends to at least 4 in at least one dimension ; galaxies with @xmath17 will essentially fill the ccd in at least one dimension ( in both dimensions if the galaxy is close to face - on ) .",
    "this means that there is often little or no area on the image where the sky background can be measured .",
    "second , many of the images proved to have significant scattered light problems , which manifest as backgrounds which are not flat at large distances from the galaxy . from comparison with images having a larger field of view ( see below ) , we suspect that the problematic wiyn images are usually affected by scattered light from nearby bright stars ; images where this was not the case ( and where the galaxy was relatively small ) were still usable . on the other hand",
    ", the not / alfosc images routinely showed large - scale variations out to the borders of the images , even when there were no bright stars in the vicinity . in this case",
    ", we suspect that scattered light from the galaxy itself is the culprit , in part because the pattern of excess light seems to match the orientation of the more elongated galaxies , and because the effect seemed to be independent of lunar phase .    to remedy this problem , we turned to images obtained with the wide field camera ( wfc ) of the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) .",
    "these were taken during two observing runs : 2003 september 1921 and 2004 march 1417 .",
    "conditions were photometric on the first night of the 2003 run and on all four nights of the 2004 run .",
    "seeing varied from 1.01.5 in the 2003 run and from 0.73.4 during the 2004 run ; poor seeing is _ not _ a problem for our analysis , since we are interested primarily in the outer disks , where we must average the light over large spatial areas .    for four more galaxies , we were able to retrieve usable images from the isaac newton group ( ing ) archives ; these were taken either with the int - wfc , the earlier prime focus camera unit on the int , or with the 1 m jacobus kapteyn telescope ( jkt ) .",
    "additional image sources included the bars project @xcite for ngc  4151 and 4596 , and the catalog of @xcite for ngc  5701 . for ngc  4612 , we made use of @xmath0-band images from the 2.4 m mdm telescope at kitt peak ( 1996 march , courtesy paul schechter ) .    finally , we found images for about three quarters of our sample in the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , including data release 5 @xcite .",
    "this provided an additional source of comparison for galaxies already observed , as well as images of _ better _ quality for 22 galaxies ( mainly because the sky background in the sdss images tended to be very uniform ) .",
    "the reduced images were retrieved from the sdss archive ; in cases where a galaxy extended off the top or bottom of a given field , we retrieved the adjacent field(s ) from the same scan and merged them to create larger images including as much of the galaxy as possible .",
    "adjacent sdss fields are sequential products of a given observing run and so can be merged without fear of significant changes in orientation or observing conditions , though secular changes in the sky background can show up as vertical gradients .",
    "table  [ tab : obs ] lists the primary and secondary images used for each galaxy .",
    "the first ( and sometimes only ) image is what we used to extract the surface - brightness profile ; if another image was useful ( e.g. , for photometric calibration or validation of the surface - brightness profile shape ) , it is listed afterwards .",
    "the reduction of images taken with the wiyn telescope has already been discussed by @xcite . here ,",
    "we focus on those images taken with the int - wfc , mdm , not , and the archival ing images .",
    "all images were reduced using standard tools and techniques within iraf , including bias subtraction and flat fielding . during our first set of int - wfc observations ( 2003 september )",
    ", we obtained both dome flats and twilight flats .",
    "test reductions using both sets of flat fields showed that the twilight flats produced significantly flatter backgrounds , so we used twilight flats for those and all subsequent int - wfc reductions .",
    "for all of the galaxies observed with the int - wfc , the central ccd ( chip 4 ) was large enough to include both the galaxy and a significant amount of sky around it , so we reduced the chip 4 images in isolation and did not attempt to construct full image mosaics . although the wfc suffers from strong optical distortions near the edges of its field , the center of chip 4 is close to the optical axis , so galaxy isophotes on that chip are not significantly affected .",
    "multiple exposures were typically offset by only 1020 , so we aligned them prior to coadding with simple linear shifts ; the shifts were calculated using positions of stars near each galaxy .",
    "proper sky subtraction is essential for deriving accurate surface brightness profiles , since under- or over - subtraction can introduce false curvature or obscure existing curvature .",
    "we inspected all images for the existence of 2d structure in the sky background by generating median - smoothed copies of each image .",
    "isolated , small - scale structures ( e.g. , dust - grain halos not removed by flat - fielding ) were masked out , but large - scale gradients , including occasional vertical gradients in sdss images , were removed using the iraf ` imsurfit ` routine .",
    "regions for the fit were selected to be both far from the galaxy and free of contamination by bright stars .",
    "we usually fit the background with a linear function , but occasionally higher - order polynomials were needed .",
    "the main stage of sky subtraction was the determination of the mean sky background level , including the level in the residual images which resulted from ` imsurfit ` processing .",
    "the method we used involved measuring the median level in @xmath18 pixel boxes in regions devoid of bright stars and scattered light , located well outside the galaxy .",
    "since , as we show below , stellar light can often be traced out to at least twice @xmath4 , we were careful to measure the sky background only in regions farther away from the galaxy . the number of regions sampled depended on the image size and the area that was free of bright stars , neighboring galaxies , etc . , but ranged between 40 and 100 .",
    "the final sky level was the mean of these 40100 median values .",
    "the advantage of measuring the sky background this way is twofold .",
    "first , we were able to avoid sampling regions that contain galaxy light or scattered light from bright stars ( the latter were identified by inspection of median - filtered copies of the images ) .",
    "second , it enabled us to compute an estimate of our uncertainty by bootstrap resampling : we re - computed the mean from a resampled set of the median values 500 times , and took the standard deviation of these 500 estimates as our uncertainty @xmath19 .",
    "a possible disadvantage of our technique is that we may occasionally understimate the sky background for the galaxy itself if there are patches of scattered light within the galaxy - dominated part of the image , though we do mask bright stars within the galaxy when we do our ellipse fitting .",
    "a more ideal method for both estimating the background level and the uncertainty thereof might be that used by @xcite and @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "concentric fixed ellipses are used to determine the intensity level as a function of radius from the galaxy center . by extending this to well outside the galaxy",
    ", the intensity will asymptotically approach the background level ; variations from one annulus to the next can be used to determine the uncertainty on the background estimate .",
    "unfortunately , this requires an image which is both very large ( with the galaxy well centered ) and very uniform , whereas a significant number of our images are either not large enough in both dimensions or contain regions affected by scattered light , or both . but",
    "a comparison of background and @xmath19 estimates for 8 sdss images measured using both methods shows that the background measurements typically differ by less than 1.5@xmath19 , and the @xmath19 values themselves agree to within 10% .",
    "following @xcite , we use the sky uncertainty @xmath19 to define a `` critical '' surface brightness level below which we consider our profiles to be uncertain .",
    "we do this by setting @xmath20 , which corresponds to the level at which a 1-@xmath21 error in the sky subtraction would shift the profile by 0.2 mag arcsec@xmath2 ( see the bottom panel of fig .  2 in pohlen & trujillo ) .",
    "this level is indicated on our profile plots by a horizontal dashed line .",
    "for the majority of our profiles , @xmath2227 in @xmath0 , but fainter levels exist : there are seven galaxies with @xmath23 mag arcsec@xmath2 .      with three exceptions , all of our images and surface brightness profiles are calibrated to cousins @xmath0 , either directly via observations of standard stars or the use of published aperture photometry , or indirectly via conversion of sdss zero points from @xmath24 to @xmath0 .",
    "the exceptions  ngc  1022 , ngc  4319 , and ugc  11920  were cases where none of our images were obtained during photometric conditions , and for which we could find no literature calibrations . although we used the sdss @xmath24 filter for many of our own observations ( to reduce the possibility of fringing in the sky background ) , we opted to calibrate all images to cousins @xmath0 .",
    "our images come from a variety of sources , and we used a variety of methods to calibrate them .",
    "the largest set was the direct calibration of our 2003 september and 2004 march int - wfc observations via standard - star observations made during the same night .",
    "for other images , we did the calibrations using short exposures from the photometric int - wfc runs , aperture photometry from the literature , or sdss images , as explained below .",
    "the first night of our 2003 september run at the int , and all four nights of our 2004 march run , were photometric .",
    "standard stars from @xcite fields were observed in both @xmath12 and @xmath24 filters throughout each photometric night .- band observations were made . ]",
    "the photometric calibration was then done by fitting following equations using the ` fitparams ` task from the iraf photcal package : @xmath25 where the instrumental magnitudes are @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the catalog magnitudes from @xcite are @xmath12 and @xmath0 , the zero points are @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the airmass .    for the @xmath0-band calibrations we used a fixed extinction term @xmath31 taken from the carlsberg meridian telescope s nightly extinction measurements .",
    "] we proceeded by first determining color terms ( @xmath32 ) for each night .",
    "we then derived mean color terms for the entire run and then re - determined the zero points ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) using the fixed color terms .",
    "the final values are given in table  [ tab : calib ] .",
    "proper calibration of individual galaxy images using the coefficients derived above requires knowing a galaxy s @xmath33 color .",
    "for some of the galaxies , we used large - aperture colors from the compilation of @xcite ; for others , we determined @xmath33 colors from large - aperture photometry on our @xmath12 and @xmath24 images , iterating until the color values converged .",
    "however , for the majority of galaxies observed with the int - wfc , we were unable to find or derive individual @xmath33 colors , so we assumed the following default colors based on hubble type : @xmath34 for s0 , @xmath35 for s0/a and sa , and @xmath36 for sb .",
    "these values are based on the calibrated colors of other galaxies in our sample , as well as additional unbarred galaxies observed during the same int - wfc observing runs . since an error of 0.1 in @xmath33 translates to a zero - point change of less than 0.01 mag , our calibrations",
    "are not strongly affected by uncertainties in galaxy colors .    for four galaxies observed with the int - wfc under photometric conditions ( plus three additional galaxies not in this barred - galaxy sample ) , we found aperture magnitudes in the literature @xcite .",
    "we used these to test the accuracy of our standard - star calibrations ; the results indicate that our calibrations agree with literature photometry to within 0.1 magnitudes , and usually to better than 0.05 magnitudes .",
    "because most of the previous observations with the wiyn telescope were made under non - photometric conditions , we also observed several of these s0sa galaxies with the int - wfc during the 2004 march run , usually with very short ( 30120s ) exposures .",
    "these were used to calibrate the pre - existing deeper exposures from the wiyn telescope , by matching surface brightness profiles derived from the wiyn and int images using the same fixed - ellipse - fit parameters .",
    "( while it is also possible to calibrate the images by performing matching aperture photometry , several of the deep wiyn images were saturated in the galaxy center . )",
    "we also used this approach to calibrate a deep image of ngc 6654 from a non - photometric night of our 2003 september int - wfc run .    for ngc 2787",
    ", we used archival jkt observations ( from 2001 january 29 ) of ngc  2787 to calibrate our wiyn image of the galaxy .",
    "the jkt observations , originally made by edo noordermeer , were obtained under photometric conditions , and were accompanied by observations of landolt standards . because the standard star observations covered only a limited range of airmass , we used the @xmath24-band extinction measurement from the carlsberg meridian telescope observations .",
    "the wiyn image was calibrated by matching aperture photometry performed on the wiyn image to that performed on the calibrated jkt images .",
    "other galaxy images were calibrated using aperture photometry from the compilation of @xcite ; these are marked with `` ph98 '' in column 6 of table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "we used the ` apphot ` task from the ` digiphot ` package of iraf to perform aperture photometry on our sky - subtracted images , using apertures of the same sizes as in the literature ( we did not use data from apertures with diameters smaller than 20 , in order to minimize possible problems from differences in seeing or centering between our measurements and those in the literature ) .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were compared with the literature values to derive appropriate zero points for the images .",
    "for ngc  4699 and ngc  7743 , the only red photometry in @xcite is the aperture photometry of @xcite , which uses their own @xmath24 filter ( _ not _ the same as the sdss @xmath24 filter ) ; we used their conversion of @xmath37 to @xmath38 . since it is not clear if the `` @xmath0 '' in this conversion corresponds to johnson @xmath0 or cousins @xmath0 , and because there has apparently been little or no follow - up calibration of this filter system , the calibrations for ngc 4699 and ngc 7743 should be considered more uncertain than those of other galaxies .      for five galaxies , we used profiles from non - sdss images but calibrated them using sdss images , as follows .",
    "we measured @xmath39 colors in large apertures centered on the galaxies in the sdss images ( large enough to encompass most of the galaxy while still staying within the image boundaries ) , and used these colors to convert the sdss @xmath24-band zero points ( derived from the headers of the tsfield files accompanying each field ) to cousins @xmath0 .",
    "the conversion used table  7 of @xcite , so that the cousins @xmath0 magnitude is @xmath40 the non - sdss images were then calibrated using matching aperture photometry .",
    "finally , there were 22 galaxies for which we used profiles derived directly from sdss images .",
    "the sdss @xmath24-band",
    "zero points were converted to cousins @xmath0 as we have just described .",
    "in this study we are primarily interested in the question _ what are the radial surface - brightness profiles of stellar disks?_. there are several related questions , such as : _ where and how often are stellar disks truncated ? _ _ what form does a truncation take ? _ _ are features such as bars , rings , and spiral arms simply azimuthal redistributions of the underlying exponential disk ? _ for all of these questions , a key first step is to determine the mean surface brightness as a function of radius .",
    "another reason that the mean ( i.e. , azimuthally averaged ) surface - brightness profiles are important is their potential for testing models of disk formation and evolution .",
    "current models for the formation of exponential disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as for such features as disk truncations or antitruncations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are almost all strictly one - dimensional",
    ".    to obtain our profiles , we used of the iraf task ` ellipse ` .",
    "it is important to distinguish between two related uses of this and other routines which fit ellipses to galaxy isophotes .",
    "the more general fitting is with `` free '' ellipses , where the ellipse position angle ( pa ) and ellipticity are allowed to vary ( as well as , optionally , the ellipse centers ) .",
    "in contrast , one can also fit using `` fixed '' ellipses , where the ellipse center , pa , and ellipticity are held fixed , and only the semi - major axis and intensity are allowed to vary .",
    "if the ellipse shape and orientation are matched to that of the projected galaxy disk , then this is ( almost ) equivalent to averaging on concentric circles for a face - on galaxy .",
    "( there will be differences if parts of the galaxy , such as its bulge , are not flat , or if the disk is very thick and the galaxy is highly inclined . )    even though free - ellipse fits are often used to generate surface brightness profiles for galaxies , there _ can _ be significant differences between profiles generated with free ellipses and profiles generated with fixed ellipses .",
    "figure  [ fig : azavg - model ] shows the different profiles produced by free - ellipse and fixed - ellipse fits for the same image , in this case an artificial galaxy consisting of an exponential disk with , at @xmath41 pixels , a bar which is a purely azimuthal redistribution of the underlying disk : @xmath42 the fixed - ellipse fit ( solid line ) recovers the underlying exponential profile , as we would expect .",
    "however , the free - ellipse - fit profile ( dashed line ) differs in the bar region , because the ellipses alter shape to track the bar - distorted isophotes .",
    "a possible real - world example of this phenomenon is shown in figure  [ fig : n4665 ] for the galaxy ngc 4665 .",
    "an additional reason for using fixed - ellipse fits is the fact that at large radii the s / n becomes so low that the free - ellipse fitting algorithm fails to converge , and the ` ellipse ` program automatically switches to fixed ellipses for larger radii . in this case ` ellipse ` uses the outermost successful ellipse fit as a template for larger radii , and this may not always be a good match to the true disk orientation ( especially if the latter can be determined from , e.g. , kinematics ) .    in order to know what ellipticity and position angle to use for the profile extraction , we of course need to know the orientation of the disk .",
    "we do this using a variety of techniques ( see @xcite , @xcite , and section  [ sec : notes ] for discussions of the determinations for individual galaxies ) , including kinematic determinations if they are available . for most galaxies ,",
    "we rely on free - ellipse fits and the assumption that the outer disk ( specifically , the disk _ outside _ any outer ring ) is intrinsically circular .",
    "note that because most of our profiles can be traced significantly further out than @xmath4 , we sometimes derive outer - disk orientations which are different from those in rc3 or leda , which may be based on intermediate structures such as outer rings .",
    "the final set of fixed - ellipse profiles is presented in section  [ sec : profile - plots ] ( figure  [ fig : profiles ] ) , along with comments on the individual galaxies .",
    "these profiles were generated using logarithmic radial spacing ( the semi - major axis of each successive annulus is 1.03 times larger ) , with the actual intensity being the median of those pixels in the annulus after a sigma - clipping algorithm was applied . in all cases ,",
    "background or neighboring galaxies and the halos of bright stars were masked out ; a typical example of this process can be seen in the upper panel of figure  2 of @xcite , although for this study we used circular and elliptical masks to better match the shapes of galaxies and stellar halos .",
    "we have usable images from at least two different telescopes for 31 of the 66 galaxies in our sample .",
    "( by `` usable , '' we mean that the images are large enough to have measurable sky background outside the galaxy , and the background is reasonably flat and free of complex scattered light . )",
    "this allows us to check the validity of our profiles and our profile classifications : how `` repeatable '' and reliable are our profiles ?",
    "figure  [ fig : comp ] shows one such comparison , for the galaxy ngc  7280 ; figure  [ fig : sdss ] shows more comparisons , concentrating on those involving sdss images .",
    "although small variations in the profiles at large radii are present , in almost all cases the basic shape of the profile is consistent .      as noted in section  [ sec : obs ] , we use profiles derived from sdss @xmath24-band images for 22 galaxies , either because images from other telescopes suffered from small fields of view or scattered light problems , or because no other images were available . at first glance",
    ", sdss images might not seem deep enough for reliable surface - brightness profiles of the faint outer disk ( @xmath43 ) ; after all , the images are from a 2.5 m telescope with effective exposure times of only 54 seconds .    in practice , we have found the sdss images to be surprisingly useful : it is possible to measure reliable ( azimuthally averaged ! ) surface brightness profiles down to at least @xmath44 , and often down to @xmath45 .",
    "@xcite reached a similar conclusion in their analysis of a large sample of sdss - derived profiles .",
    "this appears to be due to a combination of three factors : sdss images are always taken during dark time ; the images are taken in drift - scan mode , which allows for very accurate flat - fielding ; and excellent telescope and camera design which significantly reduces scattered light problems ( gunn et al .",
    "1998 , 2006 ) .    to show how reliable the profiles from sdss images are , figure  [ fig : sdss ] compares profiles from sdss images with profiles from our own deeper observations ( i.e. , longer exposure times with similar - sized or larger telescopes ) . in some cases",
    ", the other images are only marginally deeper ( e.g. , 120s on the 2.5 m int ) , but in others we have combined images with cumulative exposures times of 10 , 20 , or even 40 minutes . as can be seen from the figure , in almost all cases the sdss - based profiles agree very well with the profiles from deeper images . even in cases where the profiles start to diverge at faint surface - brightness levels ( e.g. , ngc  3941 , ngc  4037 , and ngc  5338 ) , the basic nature of the profiles are unchanged : for example , both profiles for ngc  4037 show a downward break at @xmath46 , indicating a type  ii profile .",
    "a similar comparison using very deep images of two galaxies from @xcite is presented in ( * ? ? ? * their fig .",
    "in this section we lay out the classification scheme we have worked out for galaxy surface brightness profiles .",
    "this scheme , summarized in figure  [ fig : scheme ] , can be thought of as having three levels : a purely descriptive classification consisting of three basic types ( i , ii , and iii ) ; a refinement for type  ii profiles based on the location of the break relative to the bar size ; and a final interpretive level applied to type  ii and type  iii profiles . some of this has already been discussed briefly in @xcite , and in more detail by @xcite .",
    "the profile classifications for individual galaxies are given in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "the first level  * type  i * vs.  * type  ii * vs.*type  iii *  is a very general , empirical description of the profile shape outside the bar radius .",
    "this is an extension of the scheme introduced by @xcite , who divided disk profiles into types  i and ii . our innovation  made possible by profiles which extend to fainter surface - brightness levels than freeman had access to  is the identification of _ type  iii _ profiles as a third major class @xcite .",
    "examples of these three basic types are given in figure  [ fig : type123 ] .",
    "* type i profiles * are single - exponential profiles , with the profile continuing out to the limit set by our sky - background uncertainty @xmath47 .",
    "* type ii profiles * contain a break , where the profile bends `` down ''  that is , the profile becomes steeper outside the break . in most cases ,",
    "the profile is exponential both inside and outside the break , with two different slopes ; in a few extreme cases , the profile inside the break is _ not _ exponential ( e.g. , ngc  2859 ) . in some galaxies",
    "the break is quite sharp ; in others it can be an extended region of gradual curvature .",
    "this class includes so - called `` truncations . ''",
    "* type iii profiles * are similar to type  ii profiles , except that the profile bends `` up '' beyond the break  that is , it changes from a steep exponential to something shallower at large radii .",
    "the outer part of the profile ( beyond the break ) is often exponential , but is sometimes curved .",
    "again , the break is sometimes sharp and sometimes gradual .",
    "we also refer to these profiles as `` antitruncations . ''",
    "the next level is a subdivision of the type  ii class , in which we note whether the break is an `` inner '' break or an `` outer '' break , based on where the break takes place _ relative to the bar radius _",
    "( see figure  [ fig : type2io ] ) .",
    "a break which is located near or at the bar radius is an `` inner '' break , which we call * type  ii.i*. a break which happens outside the bar is an `` outer '' break and is called * type  ii.o*. this subclassification obviously depends on the galaxy having a bar whose length we can measure ! in the absence of a bar ,",
    "we are left with a plain `` type  ii '' profile , as used for unbarred galaxies in @xcite .",
    "the final classification stage is an interpretive one , in which we attempt to say something about the _ nature _ , and possibly the cause , of the breaks in type  ii and iii profiles .",
    "note that the use of `` ( ? ) '' after a profile classification in table  [ tab : results ] means that the _ last _ part of the classification is uncertain .",
    "e.g. , `` iii - s ( ? ) '' means that the profile is definitely type iii , but that the spheroid identification for the morphology of the outer light ( section  [ sec : type3 ] ) is uncertain .",
    "first , we observe that many type  ii.o profiles have a break which coincides with an outer ring ( see figure  [ fig : type2olr - vs - ct ] , top panels , for an example ) .",
    "even for those cases where no outer ring is visible ( as in many s0 galaxies ) , the break occurs at @xmath483 times the bar radius , which is where outer rings are usually found ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since outer rings are generally understood to be linked to the outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) of bars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , we call these * type ii.o - olr * profiles ( or `` olr breaks '' ) .",
    "if the olr link is more circumstantial  that is , if there is no outer ring seen in the galaxy , but the break is at @xmath483 times the bar radius ,  then we refer to them as * type ii.o - olr ( ? ) * profiles . more detailed arguments for this classification will be presented in @xcite .        in two galaxies with type  ii.o profiles ( ngc  2273 and ngc  2950 ) ,",
    "the break occurs well _ outside _ what appears to be the outer ring ; see figure  [ fig : type2olr - vs - ct ] , bottom panels . in these cases ,",
    "the break is apparently _ not _ related to the bar s olr .",
    "we therefore consider these to be examples of `` classical truncations , '' so named because they seem similar to the `` truncations '' first seen in edge - on , late - type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "such breaks are usually supposed to be related to star - formation thresholds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we call these profiles * type ii.o - ct*.    in ngc 5338 , the break is at 34 times the bar radius .",
    "although no outer ring is visible in this galaxy , we conclude that this break is outside the probable radius of the olr , and so we classify the profile as type  ii.o - ct ( ? ) . in the case of ngc 4037 ,",
    "the break is at 2.43.1 time the bar radius , and again there is no visible outer ring . because the break is at a low surface brightness level",
    " as is the case for the breaks in ngc 2273 , 2950 , and 5338  it is tempting to consider this another classical truncation .",
    "however , since the break radius is not clearly beyond the limits of plausible olr breaks , the situation is ambiguous ; we leave this galaxy with an unmodified ii.o classification .",
    "finally , we note that we do _ not _ see any examples of the `` type  ii - ab '' ( `` apparent / asymmetric break '' ) profiles that @xcite found in 13% of their galaxies .",
    "they noted that these seemed to occur only in sc ",
    "sd galaxies and not in any of the earlier ( sb  sbc ) galaxies in their sample ; it is apparently due to strong lopsidedness in the outer isophotes .",
    "since all galaxies discussed in _ this _ paper are sb or earlier , this would appear to reinforce their suggestion that the type  ii - ab profile is a late - type phenomenon .",
    "we also define an interpretive subdivision for type  iii profiles .",
    "this is based on whether the evidence indicates that the outer part of the profile , beyond the break , is still part of the disk ( * type iii - d * ) or whether it is due to a more spheroidal component ( * type iii - s * ) .",
    "the distinction between these two subdivisions is explained in somewhat more detail , with illustrative examples , in @xcite .",
    "the clearest signature of a spheroidal component ( type iii - s ) is when the isophotes for an inclined galaxy become progressively rounder at larger radii , and the transition between inner and outer slopes is smooth , not abrupt ( figure  [ fig : type3s ] ) .",
    "this is what one would expect if the light at large radii is coming from a rounder structure , in which the inclined disk is embedded .",
    "cases where the outer light is part of the disk ( type iii - d ) can be identified in two ways . when the galaxy is inclined , the outer light appears to have the same ellipticity as the inner light , suggesting it is still coming from the disk ( figure  [ fig : type3d ] ) . in other cases ( e.g. , face - on galaxies , where both disks and spheroids will produce roughly circular isophotes )",
    ", we can sometimes see clear spiral arms in the outer region , which again are signs that the outer light is still coming from a disk ( figure  [ fig : type3d - spirals ] ) .",
    "one could argue that the type iii - s classification does nt really represent the _ disk _ profile , so that we might just as easily refer to these as , e.g. , `` type i + spheroid '' and reserve `` type iii '' strictly for the disky cases ( what we currently call type iii - d ) . for consistency , however , and because in some cases we can not be certain the outer light _",
    "is _ from a spheroid , we keep the type iii - s term .",
    "the type  i / ii / iii classification scheme , with the associated subtypes , does a good job of capturing the main variations we see in the disk profiles .",
    "nevertheless , nature is nothing if not perverse , and there are at least four galaxies whose profiles are more complicated , combining elements of more than one type .",
    "( pohlen & trujillo 2006 also found examples of composite profiles in their late - type sample . ) these are all cases where the inner part of the profile ( that is , outside the central photometric `` bulge '' and any excess or `` shoulder '' associated with the bar ) has a type  ii character , but at larger radii the profile appears to be type  iii ; see figure  [ fig : composite ] for two examples .",
    "we do _ not _ see any profiles with _ two _ downward - bending breaks , nor do we see any cases of type  iii profiles with truncations .    in some galaxies",
    "( e.g. , ngc  3412 , figure  [ fig : type3s ] ) , the complex profile appears to be a simple case of a type  ii _ disk _ plus light from a spheroid which dominates at large radii to produce the type  iii - s profile .",
    "there are other galaxies where the outer excess light is still part of the disk .",
    "for example , the outer excess light in the profile of ngc  3982 ( @xmath49 ) comes from a region dominated by two blue spiral arms ( figure  [ fig : type3d - spirals ] ) . in all cases ,",
    "we indicate such composite profiles with a plus sign , e.g. , `` type ii.o - olr + iii - d , '' where the first type is the innermost .",
    "there are also some profiles where we have hints of excess light at large radii ( e.g. , ngc  3507 ) , but",
    "the s / n at those radii is too low for us to be absolutely certain . to deal with these cases",
    ", we use a criterion based on the magnitude difference between the point where the apparent outer excess begins ( @xmath50 in the case of ngc  3507 ) and the limiting magnitude from the sky - background uncertainty ( @xmath51 for ngc  3507 ) . if this difference is @xmath52 mag",
    ", we consider the type  iii classification secure and list it in table  [ tab : results ] ; if it is between 0.5 and 1.5 mag , we include a tentative note on the plot ( `` [ + iii ? ] '' in the case of ngc  3507 ) and in the `` notes '' column of table  [ tab : results ] ; if the difference is smaller than 0.5 mag ( e.g. , ngc  3368 or ngc  4267 ) , then we do not consider it a significant detection .",
    "we fit exponentials to portions of the surface - brightness profile which appear approximately linear on the plots . in almost all cases ,",
    "we look for a reasonably linear zone outside the bar region ; in many galaxies , the bar is marked by an excess `` shoulder '' over the exponential profile outside ( see , e.g. , ngc  4245 and 936 in fig .  [",
    "fig : type123 ] ) .",
    "we also exclude clear , extended bumps due to outer rings , on the principle that such features can be treated as excess flux on top of an underlying exponential .",
    "when fitting regions of the profile that extend down to our limiting surface - brightness level @xmath47 , we set the outer limit of the fit at the radius where @xmath53 , except in cases where the profile becomes visibly noisy near that limit , in which case we stop the fit just outside the beginning of the noisy part of the profile .    after isolating the region or regions to fit , we regrid the data to a linear radial spacing using cubic - spline interpolation , and then perform a simple linear , least - squares fit .",
    "we regrid because the logarithmic spacing in the original profile means more data points at smaller radii ; this can bias the fit so that it does not match the outer part of the profile well .",
    "this is not an ideal solution , by any means ; in doing this , we ignore the fact that the data points at smaller radii have higher s / n , and could provide better constraint on the fit if they were properly weighted  at least if the underlying profile were known to be intrinsically exponential . however , local non - exponentiality ( e.g. , due to spiral arms or dust ) at small radii could then bias the fit .",
    "we note that a limited comparison was made by @xcite , who found that exponential slopes for type  i profiles obtained this way generally agreed with slopes determined by @xcite for the same galaxies , even though the latter authors used poisson - noise weighting in their fitting .",
    "for the case of type ii.o profiles , we attempt to fit the parts of the profile both inside and outside of the break in a piecewise fashion , as done by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "pohlen et al.demonstrated that it makes sense to try doing this even when one is dealing with classical truncations in late - type spirals , since the profile outside the break is clearly exponential .",
    "one might , however , ask why we bother fitting two exponentials to some of the more extreme type ii.o profiles , where the inner profile is `` exponential '' only over a relatively short range ( e.g. , ngc  2962 and ngc 3945 ; see also the discussion of ngc  6654 (  vii zw 793  ) in * ? ? ? * ) . we do this because we want to start from a position of agnosticism on the question of when a profile is `` truncated '' or not .",
    "discussions of disk truncation usually assume that `` the '' exponential disk is the part of the profile _ inside _ of the break .",
    "in contrast , the traditional picture of type ii profiles is that the exponential disk is the _ outer _ part of the profile , outside of the break  even if the inner profile is also exponential .",
    "if we resolutely fit _ both _ parts of the profile , inside and outside the break radius , we can use the results as part of a general analysis of type ii.o profiles @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are a small number of type ii.o profiles which are genuinely ambiguous : the break is located at about the right radius for an olr , but the inner profile is fairly steep and extended and so the break is _ also _ plausible as a classical truncation . future analysis  and better development of models which predict the characteristics of broken profiles  may allow us to more cleanly classify such profiles , but in the meantime we adopt a pluralistic approach .",
    "we note that there are only two type ii.o profiles where the profile inside the break ( i.e. , between the bar and the break ) is clearly non - exponential : ngc  2859 and ngc 3982 , not the type  iii break further out . ] ; for these galaxies , we do not report an inner scale length .",
    "note that we do _ not _ fit the outer part of a type  iii profile if we can identify it as type  iii - s , since in such cases the outer part of the profile is often non - exponential ( e.g. , ngc 3941 ) , and in any case we are assuming that it is part of a surrounding spheroid , not an exponential subsection of the disk . ; these are the radii where the outer profiles begin to dominate over the inner exponentials .",
    "] we also do not fit the region inside the break of type  ii.i profiles , since this is within the bar region and is often non - exponential . in this sense , we treat type  ii.i profiles as being similar to type  i profiles : they have a single exponential disk outside the bar .",
    "the results of these fits  the central surface brightness and exponential scale length for each of the exponential fits  are given in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "the inner - profile fits ( or the single fit for a type  i profile ) are denoted by @xmath54 and @xmath55 for the central surface brightness and the exponential scale length , respectively ; the outer - profile fits are denoted by @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "these are _ observed _ values ; we have not applied any corrections for inclination or dust extinction ( intrinsic or galactic ) .",
    "we also do not apply any redshift corrections , but since these galaxies are all at redshifts of 2000 km  s@xmath8 or less , any such corrections would be negligible .",
    "the measurements of the break radius and the surface brightness of the break for type  ii and iii profiles , also listed in table  [ tab : results ] , is explained below .",
    "the break radius in type ii.o and type  iii - d profiles can be estimated by eye from the profiles , or by determining the point where the exponentials fitted to the inner and outer slopes ( `` piecewise '' fits ) intersect .",
    "a somewhat more precise and rigorous approach is to fit the whole profile ( excluding the bulge and bar region ) with a function containing a parameterized break .",
    "we do this using a `` broken - exponential '' function , inspired in part by the broken power - law function known as the `` nuker law '' @xcite used to model hst profiles of galaxy centers .",
    "our broken - exponential function is described in more detail in @xcite , but in brief it consists of two exponential pieces joined by a transition region of variable `` sharpness '' : @xmath58^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha } ( \\frac{1}{\\gamma } \\ , - \\ , \\frac{1}{\\beta})},\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the central intensity of the inner exponential , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the inner and outer exponential scale lengths ( corresponding to @xmath55 and @xmath57 in our piecewise fits ) , @xmath62 is the break radius , and @xmath63 parameterizes the sharpness of the break .",
    "low values of @xmath63 mean very smooth , gradual breaks , while high values correspond to abrupt transitions ; typical values of @xmath63 for our profiles range between 0.1 and 1 .",
    "@xmath64 is a scaling factor , given by @xmath65        the inner and outer scale lengths from the broken - exponential fits generally agree quite well with the piecewise fits : the median difference is 15% , depending on whether one compares inner or outer scale lengths , and whether one is considering type  ii.o or type  iii profiles .",

    "<S> we present a study of 66 barred , early - type ( s0sb ) disk galaxies , focused on the disk surface brightness profile outside the bar region , with the aim of throwing light on the nature of freeman type i and ii profiles , their origins , and their possible relation to disk truncations . </S>",
    "<S> this paper discusses the data and their reduction , outlines our classification system , and presents @xmath0-band profiles for all galaxies in the sample , along with their classifications . in subsequent papers </S>",
    "<S> , we will explore the structure of outer disks as revealed by these profiles , and investigate their possible origins .    </S>",
    "<S> the profiles are derived from a variety of different sources , including the sloan digital sky survey ( data release 5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for about half of the galaxies , we have profiles derived from more than one telescope ; this allows us to check the stability and repeatability of our profile extraction and classification . </S>",
    "<S> the vast majority of the profiles are reliable down to levels of @xmath1 mag arcsec@xmath2 ; in exceptional cases , we can trace profiles down to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we can typically follow disk profiles out to at least 1.5 times the traditional optical radius @xmath4 ; for some galaxies , we find light extending to @xmath5 . for type  i ( single - exponential ) profiles </S>",
    "<S> , this means that we can trace the exponential disk out to 67 scale lengths .    </S>",
    "<S> we classify the profiles into three main groups : type i ( single - exponential ) , type ii ( down - bending ) , and type iii ( up - bending ) . </S>",
    "<S> the frequencies of these types are approximately 27% , 42% , and 24% , respectively , plus another 6% which are combinations of types ii and iii . </S>",
    "<S> we further classify type ii profiles by where the break falls in relation to the bar length , and in terms of the postulated mechanisms for breaks at large radii ( `` classical trunction '' of star formation versus the influence of the outer lindblad resonance of the bar ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also classify the type iii profiles by the probable morphology of the outer light ( disk or spheroid ) . </S>",
    "<S> illustrations are given for all cases . </S>"
