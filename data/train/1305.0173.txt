    "the study of azimuthal anisotropy , based on fourier coefficients , is widely recognized as an important tool to probe the hot , dense matter created in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "these measurements are sensitive to early stage evolution of the system . in a picture of hydrodynamic expansion of the system formed in the collisions ,",
    "these final state momentum anisotropies are expected to rise due to the initial state anisotropy driven pressure gradients and subsequent interactions of the constituents .",
    "specially the differential measurement of azimuthal anisotropy have been found to be sensitive to initial condition , thermalization , the equation of state and transport coefficients of the medium in the heavy ion collisions .",
    "azimuthal anisotropy quantified by the fourier coefficient of the particle distribution can be written as    @xmath4    where @xmath3 is the transverse momentum , @xmath5 is rapidity and @xmath6 is the azimuthal angle of each particle and @xmath7 is the true reaction plane angle , defined by beam direction and impact parameter vector between two colliding nuclei .",
    "the sine terms in the fourier expansion vanish due to the reflection symmetry with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "the reaction plane @xmath7 is not measurable directly a priori , so the fourier coefficients are determined with respect to the estimated participant event planes  @xcite ,    @xmath8    where @xmath9 are the generalized participant event planes at all orders for each event .",
    "the estimated event plane from detected particles is corrected for event plane resolution .",
    "the measured @xmath0 with respect to @xmath9 for reasonable event - plane resolutions are closer to the root - mean - square values  @xcite than the mean values .",
    "the first harmonic coefficient @xmath10 , called directed flow , has two components rapidity odd directed flow generated due to bounce off motion of the nuclei and rapidity even directed flow due to dipole asymmetry in the initial geometry .",
    "the directed flow measurement should suppress the the contribution from global momentum conservation especially at peripheral collisions along with other non - flow contributions .",
    "the rapidity odd @xmath11 component at 200 gev au+au collision is found very small at mid - rapidity and becomes significant at forward rapidity  @xcite .",
    "the rapidity even component @xmath11 recently reported at 200 gev au+au collisions  @xcite form star collaboration is found to have weak rapidity dependence as predicted by some models  @xcite .",
    "the transverse momentum dependence of rapidity event @xmath12 is of interest in the present study .",
    "the second harmonic coefficient @xmath13 , popularly known as elliptic flow have been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "recently higher order harmonics have also gained attention both from theory and experimental community .",
    "these higher order harmonics can provide valuable information about the initial state of the colliding system  @xcite and also provide an natural explanation to the ridge phenomena in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "measurement of these harmonics in different systems and collisions energy helps to further understand the heavy ion physics in general .    in uranium - uranium ( u+u ) collisions",
    ", there is the potential to produce more extreme conditions of excited matter at higher density and/or greater volume than is possible using spherical nuclei like gold or lead at the same incident energy  @xcite .",
    "uranium has quadrupole deformed shape .",
    "so u+u collisions may offer an opportunity to explore wider range of initial eccentricities .",
    "the collisions of special interest are the",
    " ideal tip - tip \" orientation in which the long axes of both deformed nuclei are aligned with the beam axis at zero impact parameter , and the  ideal body - body \" orientation in which the long axes are both perpendicular to the beam axis and parallel to each other at zero impact parameter .",
    "ideal tip - tip \" and  ideal body - body \" collision events allow to test the prediction of hydrodynamical model(s ) by varying the transverse particle density at spatial eccentricity similar to central au+au collisions .",
    "we report here the first @xmath0 measurements in u+u collisions from the star experiment at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at @xmath14 193 gev .",
    "these data were collected during rhic run - xii in the year 2012 .",
    "these measurements are presented as a function of transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) and centrality .",
    "data reported in this proceedings were collected in u+u collisions at @xmath1 = 193 gev in the year 2012 with a minimum bias trigger and the ultra central events were taken with a dedicated central trigger . main detector used in the present measurements is the time projection chamber ( tpc )  @xcite , the primary tracking device at star .",
    "tpc has full azimuthal coverage and uniform acceptance in @xmath15 units of pseudorapidity .",
    "the charged particle momenta are measured by reconstructing their trajectories through the tpc .",
    "the events with the primary collision vertex position along the beam direction @xmath16 within 30 cm of the center of the detector are selected for this analysis .",
    "event vertex is further required to be in the transverse direction within 2.0 cm from the center of the beam pipe .",
    "centrality classes in u+u collisions at @xmath1 = 193 gev are defined using the number of charged particle tracks reconstructed in the time projection chamber(tpc ) within pseudorapidity @xmath17 and passing within 3 cm of interaction vertex .",
    "the uncorrected , i.e. not corrected for acceptance and reconstruction efficiency , multiplicity ( @xmath18 ) distribution for events with a reconstructed primary vertex is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .     in u+u collisions at @xmath1 = 193 gev .",

    "this analysis was carried out on tracks that had transverse momenta @xmath20 gev@xmath21 , passed within 3 cm of the primary vertex , had at least 15 space points in the main tpc acceptance @xmath22 and the ratio of the number of actual space points to the maximum possible number of space points for that track s trajectory was greater than 0.52 .    for any fourier harmonic _",

    "the event plane vector is reconstructed from tracks with transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) up to 2 gev/@xmath31 and within @xmath32 .",
    "for first harmonics(n=1 ) , the weight is taken as ,    @xmath33    and for higher harmonics ( @xmath34 ) the weight is equal to the transverse momentum @xmath35    the @xmath36 and @xmath37 represent event averaged quantities .",
    "the choice of this weight corrects the effect of the momentum conservation and also it cancels out the conventional pseudorapidity asymmetric directed flow  @xcite .",
    "we used scalar product method as well as the event plane method to measure the signal . in the scalar product method ,",
    "the particles with @xmath38 were assigned to one subevent and particles with @xmath39 to the other subevent , separated by @xmath40 gap of 1.0 units between two subevents and at least 0.5 unit with the particle of interest and the subevent to which it is correlated . in order to remove the acceptance effects we applied recentering correction  @xcite to the flow vectors . with unit vector defined as @xmath41 ,",
    "the first harmonic coefficient @xmath0 is evaluated as ,    @xmath42    @xmath43    in the event plane method , the particles with @xmath44 were assigned to one subevent and particles with @xmath45 to the other subevent , so that subevents were separated by @xmath40 gap of 0.2 units .",
    "larger pseudorapidity separation was desired but we are limited by the event plane resolution . in this method , we first evaluate the event plane angle @xmath9 from the event plane vector ( @xmath46 ) and the event plane angle was flattened using a shifting correction method to correct for the detector acceptance effects . the particle correlation with event plane angle @xmath9",
    "is given by ,    @xmath47    @xmath48",
    "results are presented with only statistical errors . in these studies ,",
    "contribution from short range correlation such as bose - einstein correlations , coulomb interactions are studied using a pseudorapidity gap of at least 0.5 units in pseudorapidity between the event vector and the particle of interest using scalar product method .",
    "results from both methods , scalar product with larger psuedorapidity gap and event plane method with smaller pseudorapidity gap are consistent with each other , which suggests that non - flow contribution from short range correlations are small .",
    "to reduce the effects from high @xmath3 particles in the estimation of the event plane , we used @xmath3 weight only up to 2 gev/@xmath31 . the non - flow contribution from the jets / minijets",
    "is not known and might be a significant contributor to the systematic uncertainties especially at peripheral collisions .",

    ", we observe very weak centrality dependence . the initial overlap geometry , which makes the dominant contribution to the elliptic flow , changes from central to peripheral collisions , giving rise to the strong centrality dependence of @xmath13 . for @xmath10 , centrality dependence",
    "is observed only at more peripheral collisions ( 40 - 80% ) where non flow contribution may be significant . the non flow contribution from the momentum conservation effect  @xcite",
    "may hot have perfectly suppressed in peripheral collisions in the measurement of @xmath10 .",
    "the centrality dependence of the geometry fluctuations are not yet understood .",
