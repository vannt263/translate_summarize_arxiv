    "starless cores are often identified through maps of their dust emission at ( sub)millimeter wavelengths , and recent surveys of nearby molecular clouds have increased the number of such objects considerably ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "analysis of the properties of starless cores is often restricted by sparse sampling of their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , uncertain dust emissivities and assumptions about their geometries . as a result , the measured ( sub)millimeter fluxes",
    "are often used in conjunction with assumed values for the dust temperature and/or emissivity to determine core masses , though the systematic errors can be substantial ( a factor of a few ) . with sufficient spectral coverage and knowlege of source geometry",
    ", it should be possible to map the column density , temperature and dust emissivity spectral index in a starless core , though this has yet to be accomplished .",
    "one of the best - studied starless cores is tmc-1c , located in the taurus molecular cloud at an approximate distance of 140 pc @xcite .",
    "previous studies of the dust emission from tmc-1c at 450 , 850 and 1200  have determined that it is cold ( @xmath36 k ) and dense ( @xmath410@xmath5 @xmath6 ) at its center , and becomes progressively less dense and warmer at larger radii @xcite .",
    "the dust - derived mass of tmc-1c is a factor of a few larger than its virial mass , and self - absorbed spectra show evidence for sub - sonic infall @xcite .",
    "the chemistry of tmc-1c is characterized by depletion of co and its isotopologues , as well as depletion of cs and @xcite .",
    "previously reported mass and temperature profiles for tmc-1c are estimated assuming a constant value for the emissivity spectral index ( @xmath7 ) @xcite . however ,",
    "a wide range of values for @xmath8 in other regions have been measured or calculated on theoretical grounds .",
    "for instance , in the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) , an emissivity spectral index of @xmath0 fits the typical far - infrared spectrum well @xcite , while grain growth in protostellar disks results in values of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "since starless cores are in an intermediate stage between the diffuse ism and protostars , one might expect that the dust in a starless core would have an emissivity spectral index in the range @xmath10 , although the timescale of grain growth at densities @xmath11 @xmath6 is several hundred times the free - fall time of a typical starless core @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the growth of icy mantles on dust grains could steepen the slope of the dust sed , and this has been cited as the reason for high values of the emissivity spectral index in parts of the orion ridge ( @xmath12 ) @xcite and in sgr b2(n ) ( @xmath13 ) @xcite . in the cold and dense evironment in tmc-1c , the dust grains could form similar icy mantles , which might drive the emissivity spectral index to values @xmath14 .",
    "in addition to changes in @xmath8 , grain growth by either coagulation or accretion of an icy mantle will change the opacity of the dust grains , @xmath15 .",
    "for instance , evidence that dust opacities are higher in dense cores than in the diffuse ism can be found by comparing gas temperature and dust emission profiles @xcite or by comparing dust and gas emission profiles @xcite . from models of dust coagulation for conditions that are plausible for a starless core , @xcite",
    "show that the dust opacity at 1.3  mm can be a factor of five higher than in a diffuse environment . using 160  data for taurus , @xcite measure an opacity of @xmath16 @xmath17g@xmath18 in the cold cloud ( @xmath19 ranging from 0.4 to 4.0 ) .",
    "the opacity is 2.6 times greater than the diffuse ism opacity @xcite , and provides evidence for higher opacity values in dense regions ( c.f .",
    "laboratory studies of possible dust grain materials have measured the dust emission and absorption properties at far - infrared and longer wavelengths .",
    "for instance , @xcite measured the absorption of silicate grains and found that @xmath20 for grains without an ice mantle , and @xmath21 for grains with an ice mantle .",
    "the steepest spectral indices calculated by @xcite were for fused quartz and olivine with ice mantles , both of which had @xmath22 , close to the extremely steep @xmath23 reported by @xcite . in a study of the millimeter - wave absorption of silicate grains in the temperature range 1.2 - 30  k , @xcite found that the emissivity spectral index depends on the dust temperature and for some materials can vary between @xmath24 , with the largest value for @xmath8 at a temperature @xmath25  k. a temperature - dependent emissivity spectral index was also found by @xcite for cosmic dust analog grains in the temperature range @xmath26  k and a wavelength range @xmath27  mm , with a steeper sed at lower temperatures .",
    "the range of emissivity spectral indices is @xmath28 for the various grain types considered by @xcite . in a study of amorphous silicates in the temperature range",
    "@xmath29  k and wavelength range @xmath30  mm , @xcite also report an anticorrelation between @xmath31 and @xmath8 , with values of the emissivity spectral index between @xmath24 .",
    "based on these laboratory measurements , one might expect that in starless cores like tmc-1c , which have temperatures close to 10  k @xcite , the emissivity spectral index would be close to @xmath32 .",
    "observations of nearby star - forming regions suggest an anticorrelation between @xmath31 and @xmath8 similar to that measured in the laboratory .",
    "for instance , observations of the orion , @xmath33 ophiuchi and taurus molecular clouds at far - infrared and ( sub)millimeter wavelengths by @xcite show that the emissivity spectral index may vary from @xmath34 as the dust temperature rises from @xmath35  k. similarly , in a study of the far - infrared and ( sub)millimeter seds of luminous infrared galaxies , @xcite report that the emissivity spectral index varies from @xmath36 as the dust temperature varies from @xmath37  k. in a study of the starless core l1498 , @xcite find an emissivity spectral index of @xmath38 for an assumed dust temperature of @xmath39  k , consistent with the hypothesis that the cold dust in a starless core has a steep spectral index .",
    "however , variations in the dust properties along the line - of - sight and noise in the observed maps can mimic an anticorrelation between @xmath31 and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , at high densities and low temperatures , grain coagulation will decrease @xmath8 while the possible @xmath31@xmath8 relation will increase the emissivity spectral index .",
    "therefore , it is not at all clear that one should expect the emissivity spectral index to vary significantly in a starless core .",
    "observations of dust emission and extinction in the dark cloud b68 show no evidence for variations in the dust properties @xcite , suggesting that to some extent the various pressures on @xmath8 may cancel out .",
    "in this paper we present maps of the starless core tmc-1c at 160 , 450 , 850 , 1200 and 2100  . by spatially resolving the emission from tmc-1c over a wide range of wavelengths",
    ", we then map the column density , temperature and emissivity spectral index of the dust , which has typically been difficult to do with previous datasets .",
    "the 160 , 450 , 850 and 1200  maps have been presented or described in previous papers @xcite , so here we briefly review the observations and data reduction , and refer the reader to the earlier papers for more details .",
    "the 2100  map has not been previously presented , so it is discussed in detail below .",
    "the spitzer data near tmc-1c derive from the taurus spitzer legacy survey @xcite , a large @xmath40 square degree map of the taurus star - forming region at seven wavelengths ranging from 3.6 to 160  .",
    "see @xcite for an overview of the survey parameters and data processing .",
    "the mips data utilize the fast scan mode with 3 seconds integration time per frame and 5 visits per pixel .",
    "the mips 160  data obtained in fast scan mode mapping does not have enough redundancy to fill in completely all the data gaps due to a dead readout and other effects . to mitigate these data gaps and to preserve the diffuse emission as much as possible , a 3 pixel by 3 pixel ( 15  per pixel ) median filter is applied to the image .",
    "the median filter introduces some image smoothing , increasing the effective angular resolution from 40  to 1 .",
    "in some cases , filtering reduces the surface brightness by 1015% , though the reduction in the map of tmc-1c is only 2% .",
    "analysis of the 160  data in taurus shows there are two main cloud components : emission from the extended cold cloud ( @xmath41  k , @xmath42 ) , and emission from compact cold cores ( @xmath310   k , high @xmath19 ) @xcite .",
    "since our present focus is the high extinction regions sampled by ( chopped ) millimeter data , here we further process the 160  data to remove the spatially extended cloud emission .",
    "following the procedure in @xcite we use iras 100  images to model and subtract the 14.2  k cloud emission .",
    "the resulting 160  image traces the high extinction ridge and looks very similar to the millimeter continuum emission . the median flux removed from original 160",
    "map is 96 mjy / sr , or about 90% of the total flux .",
    "uncertainties in the temperature of the extended cloud component results in a 10% uncertainty in the final 160  map . given the 12% absolute flux uncertainty of mips 160  maps @xcite , we conservatively estimate the absolute uncertainty in the 160  `` cold core '' map to be 20% .      although in previous papers on tmc-1c we used sub - millimeter maps observed and reduced by us @xcite , in this paper we use maps of tmc-1c at 450 and 850  from the new scuba legacy catalogues @xcite .",
    "we choose to use the new maps because they include all of the data taken with scuba @xcite at all epochs and use the most current calibration and reduction methods .",
    "the noise in the maps are 132 and 21 mjy beam@xmath18 at 450 and 850  , respectively , and have resolutions of appoximately 9  and 14 .",
    "the uncertainties in the absolute flux calibration ( primarily due to beam - shape uncertainty and fluctuations of opacity above the telescope during observations and calibration ) , are 20% at 850  and 50% at 450  , as described in @xcite .",
    "we set the zero point of the legacy maps by determining the median flux density in two regions off the core but nearby and subtracting these values ( -0.32 and -0.035 jy beam@xmath18 ) from the 450 and 850  maps .",
    "we observed the 1200  continuum emission from tmc-1c in the autumns of 2002 and 2003 using the mambo-2 array @xcite on the iram 30  m telescope on pico veleta ( spain ) , producing a map with 10.7  resolution .",
    "data were taken with on - the - fly mapping , with the telescope sub - reflector chopping in azimuth by 60 - 70 , and the resultant image was reconstructed using the @xcite algorithm iteratively to properly reproduce large - scale emission .",
    "the noise in map is 3 mjy beam@xmath18 , and the flux calibration uncertainty , as derived from the rms of calibrator observations across pooled observing sessions and the uncertainty in the intrinsic calibrator fluxes , is about 10% . for further details on the 1200  observations and data reduction , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we observed the 2100  continuum emission from tmc-1c in the autumn of 2007 using bolocam on the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) .",
    "data were collected in raster scan mode at a scan speed of 240s@xmath18 , with a step size between rasters of 11 .",
    "each raster was 20  in length , and each of the 105 total scans were separated by 11 .",
    "the resultant map has a coverage of @xmath220@xmath4320with 60resolution .",
    "three sets of observations contain rasters parallel to ra , and the other three contain rasters parallel to dec . data reduction and flux calibration , accomplished through observations of uranus and neptune , was done as described in @xcite .",
    "observations at approximately 2  mm are dominated by sky noise .",
    "although the bolocam pipeline pca cleaning algorithm efficiently removes sky noise , it also removes some of the source flux .",
    "this decreases the peak intensity , introduces negative bowls around bright sources , and reduces the brightness on scales larger than @xmath44 for extended sources .",
    "we recover this lost flux using a mapping algorithm that iteratively subtracts a source model from the real data ( for more description and performance evaluation , see * ? ? ?",
    "this technique is similar to clean @xcite , but works in the image plane , and the real data are used for the source model rather than , e.g. , a gaussian component model . the first source model is formed from the original map , including only regions with signal - to - noise greater than 1.5 .",
    "that source model is subtracted from the original timestream data , which is then re - cleaned and mapped without the source flux . this process is iterated until the source model stabilizes , 10 iterations in this case .",
    "tmc-1c is a faint source , so the correction is relatively small , with the source flux density increasing by up to 30% after iterative mapping .",
    "the noise is the 2100  map is 8  mjy  beam@xmath18 , and the uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration is @xmath220% .",
    "here we estimate the temperature , column density and emissivity spectral index in tmc-1c using our flux density maps at 160 , 450 , 850 , 1200 and 2100  . under the assumptions that the dust is isothermal and characterized by a single emissivity spectral index ,",
    "the flux density per beam in each map can be described as a modified blackbody , given by ,    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and @xmath47    in equation ( [ fluxeq ] ) , @xmath48 is the flux density per beam , @xmath49 is the solid angle of the beam , @xmath50 is the blackbody emission from the dust at temperature @xmath31 , @xmath51 is the mean molecular weight of interstellar material in a molecular cloud per hydrogen molecule , @xmath52 is the mass of the hydrogen atom , @xmath53 is the column density of hydrogen molecules , and a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 is assumed . in equation ( [ kappaeq ] ) ,",

    "* column 6 of table 1 ) and @xmath8 is the emissivity spectral index of the dust . although equations ( [ fluxeq ]  [ kappaeq ] ) are often used to described the observed emission from starless cores , such observations average over a range of dust grain properties .",
    "furthermore , the emissivity ( @xmath55 ) is uncertain by roughly a factor of 2 .",
    "if we had chosen a different value for @xmath55 , this would affect the derived column density , but would have no impact on the derived temperature and emissivity spectral index .",
    "we do not consider variations in @xmath55 in this paper , but instead save this analysis for a future analysis .",
    "the fluxes given in the dust emission maps are derived from the total energy detected convolved with the wavelength - dependent instrumental response and an assumed sed of the emitting source .",
    "the assumed seds in the _ spitzer _ , scuba , mambo and bolocam maps are that of a 10,000  k blackbody , a flat - spectrum source , a flat - spectrum source and a blackbody in the rayleigh - jeans regime , respectively . because we are observing emission from dust , with an assumed sed of a modified blackbody , the quoted flux at the nominal wavelength of each map ought to be corrected .",
    "however , the relatively narrow bandpasses of the detectors results in a modest correction factor .    for each map , we use the instrumental response and our best - guess dust sed of a modified blackbody with @xmath56  k and @xmath0 to find the `` reference '' wavelength of the observations .",
    "the integral of the convolution of the instrumental response and the dust sed are equal above and below this reference wavelength .",
    "@xmath57    where @xmath58 is the flux emitted by the dust at wavelength @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the instrumental response at wavelength @xmath59 .",
    "the reference wavelength , used in our calculations of the dust emission properties , are close to the nominal wavelength of each map , with the biggest difference in the mambo map because of its wide bandpass . in all maps ,",
    "the flux uncertainties are larger than the correction from using the reference wavelength in our calculations rather than the nominal wavelength .",
    "the derived reference wavelengths are given in table [ fluxtab ] .",
    "one way to estimate the dust temperature , column density and emissivity spectral index is to fit modified blackbody seds ( given by equations [ fluxeq ]  [ kappaeq ] ) to the five fluxes ( at 160 , 450 , 850 , 1200 and 2100  ) at each position .",
    "although the resolutions of the maps at 450 , 850 and 1200  are fairly similar ( from 7.5   14 ) , the 60  resolution of the 160 and 2100  maps is not a good match to the others . here",
    "we handle the mismatched beam sizes by making an average sed from the five flux maps to derive the best - fit dust properties ( @xmath31 , @xmath53 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "we first smooth the 450 , 850 and 1200  maps to the resolution of the 160 and 2100  maps by convolution with a two - dimensional gaussian beam .",
    "we then calculate the average flux in those pixels brighter than 3@xmath61 in the 160 , 850 , 1200 , and 2100  maps , and brighter than 2@xmath61 in the 450  map ( which is noisier than the other maps ) .",

    "the noise level in the maps is determined in regions off - source but near tmc-1c ( see figure [ fivefluxplot ] ) .",
    "we then used a @xmath62 minimization routine to fit the five measured fluxes with a modified blackbody sed , finding the values of @xmath31 , @xmath53 and @xmath8 .    in order to determine how noise and calibration uncertainties affect the accuracy of the derived dust properties , we run a simple monte carlo simulation",
    ". in each trial , gaussian random noise of the amount observed",
    "is added to each flux map , and then each map is scaled by a multiplicative factor @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is randomly chosen from a normal distribution of mean zero and standard deviation equal to the absolute calibration uncertainty in each map .",
    "each map is modified by a different scale factor @xmath65 , and this process was repeated 5000 times .",
    "we find that the best - fit dust properties for the average sed over tmc-1c are @xmath8 =  @xmath66 , @xmath31 =  @xmath66 , and @xmath53 =  @xmath66 .",
    "the observed fluxes and best - fit sed are plotted in figure [ singlesedplot ] and the fluxes and uncertainties are given in table [ fluxtab ] .",
    "a fundamental flaw in this analysis is that equations [ fluxeq ]  [ kappaeq ] are only accurate for isothermal dust characterized by a single emissivity spectral index , but tmc-1c is known to be warmer at its edges than at the center @xcite , and it is certainly possible that @xmath8 also changes within the starless core . as shown by @xcite , the incorrect assumption of isothermal dust drives an anti - correlation between the derived dust temperature and emissivity spectral index .",
    "a spurious anti - correlation between @xmath31 and @xmath8 may also arise due to noise in the emission maps @xcite .",
    "an anti - correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath31 is seen in the monte carlo simulation we used to derive the dust properties , as shown in figure [ singlesedplot ] . in the following section we attempt to mitigate the effects of variations in the dust properties on our analysis .",

    "the line - of - sight variations in the dust properties can not be determined without knowledge of the geometry of the core , but variations in the plane of the sky are more tractable . here",
    "we make maps of tmc-1c , first of the temperature and column density while holding the emissivity spectral index constant , and then of all three quantities .",

    ", using new 160 and 2100  maps and an improved reduction of the 450 and 850  maps , we are able to estimate the emissivity spectral index and make an improved analysis of the temperature and column density in tmc-1c .    we find that the spectral index of the dust emission , as calculated by a variety of related methods , is in the range @xmath90 this is consistent with the value of the emissivity spectral index often assumed in studies of starless cores , and is also consistent with laboratory measurements and observations of the behavior of dust grains at low temperatures ( @xmath91  k ) .",
    "however , there is still a relatively large uncertainty in the emissivity spectral index .",
    "using the new estimate of the emissivity spectral index in tmc-1c ( @xmath92 ) , we construct temperature and column density maps , which reach values of @xmath93 and @xmath94 at the position of the dust peak , as shown in figure [ maptdavbetaplot ] .",
    "we find no conclusive evidence that @xmath8 varies within the core , though line - of - sight temperature variations and noise in the flux maps leave open the possibility that the emissivity spectral index is anti - correlated with dust temperature .",

    "<S> in this paper we present a dust emission map of the starless core tmc-1c taken at 2100  . along with maps at 160 , 450 , 850 and 1200  , we study the dust emissivity spectral index from the ( sub)millimeter spectral energy distribution , and find that it is close to the typically assumed value of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we also map the dust temperature and column density in tmc-1c , and find that at the position of the dust peak ( @xmath1 ) , the line - of - sight - averaged temperature is @xmath27  k. employing simple monte carlo modeling , we show that the data are consistent with a constant value for the emissivity spectral index over the whole map of tmc-1c . </S>"
