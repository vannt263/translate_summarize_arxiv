    "based on the idea of a brane - world suggested from string theory@xcite , randall and sundrum proposed an interesting scenario that we may live on either of two boundary 3-branes with positive and negative tensions in the 5-dimensional anti - de sitter space ( ads ) @xcite .",
    "one of the attractive features of the randall - sundrum ( rs ) scenario is that the gravity on the brane is confined within a short distance from the brane even for an infinitely large extra - dimension@xcite .",
    "this applies to the positive tension brane and it is because the ads bulk on both sides of the positive tension brane shrinks exponentially as one goes away from the brane .",
    "since the rs scenario gives an exciting , new picture of our universe , it is clearly important to study various aspects of this scenario to test it or to give constraints on its parameters .",
    "one good example is an analysis done by garriga and tanaka@xcite , in which they have shown that the radion in the original rs scenario acts as a brans - dicke scalar on the branes at the linear perturbation order and the effective gravity is that of a brans - dicke theory with positive and negative brans - dicke parameters on the positive and negative tension branes , respectively , where the values of the brans - dicke parameters are determined by the distance between the two branes . in a previous paper , we have shown that essentially the same situation arises in the case of two de sitter ( ds ) branes embedded in the ads bulk .",
    "however , we have also shown that the radion effectively has a negative mass squared with its absolute value proportional to the curvature of the ds brane , hence is unstable if it can fluctuate by itself without the matter energy momentum tensor .",
    "the phenomenon we shall study in this paper is the quantum fluctuation of this mode , called the quantum radion . to make clear what we mean by the quantum radion , let us describe the mode in more detail .",
    "our brane universe may be displaced from the 0th order trajectory of a homogeneous and isotropic brane . by appropriately fixing the coordinate gauge ,",
    "the displacement perpendicular to the brane can be described by a scalar function on the brane .",
    "assuming there are two branes that are fixed points of the @xmath5 symmetry , it can be shown that only the relative displacement of the two branes is physical , which we call the radion .",
    "there are two distinctively different kinds of displacement of a brane : the `` bend '' and `` fluctuation '' .",
    "the bend is a type of displacement due to inhomogeneities of the matter energy - momentum tensor on the brane .",
    "the trace of the energy - momentum acts as an additional tension of the brane , and the brane must `` bend '' accordingly .",
    "the relative bend is described by the mode of radion that couples with the source on the branes , and it can be written as a functional of the energy - momentum tensor@xcite . in the context of the quasi - localized gravity discussed by gregory , rubakov & sibiryakov@xcite , the role of this type of radion has been extensively studied@xcite . on the other hand , the `` fluctuation '' is a type of displacement that is purely geometrical , which obeys a free wave equation without source .",
    "the relative displacement of this kind is the mode of radion which we shall discuss in this paper .",
    "this mode of radion was studied first by charmousis , gregory and rubakov for the rs branes whose effective radion mass is zero by solving the field equations for the rs branes @xcite and by chacko and fox@xcite for the ds and ads branes whose effective radion mass squared are negative and positive , respectively .",
    "the fact that the radion mass squared is negative ( or zero ) suggests the ( marginal ) instability of the two brane system .",
    "in fact , in the case of the original rs flat two brane model@xcite , the negativity of the brans - dicke parameter on the negative tension brane@xcite can be regarded as a result of this marginal instability . to recover the stability , goldberger & wise introduced a bulk scalar field@xcite that couples to the branes in such a way that the distance between the two branes is stabilized .",
    "however , it should be also noted that the effective brans - dicke parameter on the positive tension brane is positive and it can be large enough to be consistent with experiments for the separation of the branes larger than the ads curvature radius at least at the linear perturbation order@xcite .",
    "hence a stabilization mechanism may be unnecessary if we live on the positive tension brane .",
    "we therefore do not introduce a stabilization mechanism .",
    "we shall work on the system that consists of an @xmath2-dimensional ads bulk spacetime bounded by two branes of constant curvature that are fixed points of the @xmath5-symmetry .",
    "the zero - curvature branes correspond to the flat rs branes@xcite , while the positive - constant curvature branes correspond to the ds branes@xcite .",
    "our main concern is of course the ds brane case , but we treat the flat brane case simultaneously to make clear the similarities and differences between the two cases .",
    "the ds brane case is of particular interest because it gives a good model of braneworld inflation . in the standard 4-dimensional inflation ,",
    "the quantum vacuum fluctuations play a very important role .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask if the quantum radion fluctuations play an important role , if not disastrous , in the braneworld inflation .",
    "it should be mentioned that historically a very similar situation was analyzed by garriga and vilenkin @xcite in which they considered the fluctuations of a thin domain wall in @xmath6 spacetime dimensions . although they assumed the minkowski background , many of the results obtained there apply equally to the present case . in particular",
    ", they showed that the wall fluctuation mode is represented by a scalar field living on the @xmath7-dimensional de sitter space which describes the internal metric on the domain wall , and the scalar field has the negative mass squared @xmath8 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bg ] , we describe the background spacetime and our notation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pert ] , we solve the perturbation equation in the bulk that describes the radion mode .",
    "we find there is a gauge degree of freedom that should be carefully treated in the ds brane case in contrast to the flat brane case where no such subtlety arises . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qradion ] , assuming the dependence on the extra dimensional coordinate that solves the perturbation equation in the bulk , we derive the effective action for the radion and quantize it . in sec .",
    "[ sec : omega ] , based on the result obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec : qradion ] , we evaluate the effective energy density of the radion on the brane which is present at the linear order in the radion amplitude , and estimate its effect by calculating the rms value .",
    "we find the effect remains small for reasonable values of the model parameters even though the radion itself is unstable . in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] , we summarize our results and discuss the implications .",
    "first , we summarize the basic equations of the system and explain our notation .",
    "the system we consider is a @xmath5 symmetric @xmath2-dimensional bulk spacetime with two @xmath0-dimensional branes as the fixed points of the symmetry .",
    "the bulk metric @xmath9 obeys the @xmath2-dimensional einstein equation : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the @xmath2-dimensional gravitational constant , @xmath12 is the @xmath2-dimensional cosmological constant which we assume to be negative , and @xmath13 is localized on the branes .",

    "of course the decay rate @xmath167 does not mean @xmath19 behaves as a dust matter .",
    "the fact that the decay rate is slower than the standard radiation fluid ( for @xmath169 ) is caused by a strong anisotropic stress present in the case of radion .",
    "thus , in this sense , the instability of radion indeed shows up on the brane , but the effect turns out to be rather mild because of the nature of de  sitter space in which the background energy density remains constant in time .",

    "we conclude that the instability of the quantum radion induces a large anisotropic stress on the brane , but because of the rapid expansion of the brane it is not strong enough to give rise to a gravitational instability on the brane .",
    "in the previous section , we have seen that the quantum radion fluctuations do not cause a gravitational instability on the brane .",
    "however , this does not necessarily mean the effect is always small .",
    "in particular , if the rms value of the effective energy density due to the radion field is comparable to the background vacuum energy density of the de sitter brane , the evolution of the brane will be significantly affected .",
    "if we regard our background to represent a braneworld undergoing cosmological inflation , this would imply a significant modification of the braneworld inflationary scenario . in this section , assuming the positive tension brane describes our universe , we consider the cosmological constraints arising from the effect of the radion quantum fluctuations .    to quantify the effect , we consider the power spectrum of the effective energy density , @xmath170 focusing on the positive tension brane , we define the power spectrum @xmath171 of @xmath172 normalized by the background energy density @xmath173 as @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the surface area of the @xmath0-dimensional unit sphere ; @xmath176 .",

    "when @xmath178 is comparable to , or larger than the order of unity , the fluctuation of the brane is non - negligible . if we integrate the above over @xmath146 , we encounter the divergence from large @xmath146 . however , this ultraviolet divergence is the same as the usual one in the minkowski background .",
    "hence , to discard the divergence , we cut off the integration at the hubble horizon scale ; @xmath181 .",

    "we have analyzed the effect of the quantum radion on the brane using the effective einstein equations derived by shiromizu , maeda and sasaki@xcite in which the radion adds an effective energy - momentum tensor at the linear order in the field amplitude . although the radion has the negative mass squared @xmath214 on the de sitter brane where @xmath215 is the hubble parameter , we have found that the corresponding instability does not show up on the brane .",
    "we have noted , however , that the anisotropic stress induced by the radion is unusually large , though it still decays in time as @xmath216 for a fixed @xmath146 , where @xmath217 is the cosmic scale factor and @xmath146 is the comoving wavenumber , and the rms value of the effective energy density for a fixed @xmath146 decays as @xmath167 irrespective of the spacetime dimensions @xmath1 .",
    "focusing on the positive tension de sitter brane with the hubble rate @xmath205 , which models the braneworld inflation , we have estimated the rms total energy density of the quantum radion by integrating over @xmath146 up to @xmath218 .",

    "then the variation of the radion effective action with respect to the 4-metric will give the energy - momentum tensor of a scalar field with a negative mass squared , which would grow and diverge in contrast to the decaying effective energy - momentum tensor we analysed in this paper .",

    "<S> the quantum fluctuation of the relative location of two @xmath0-dimensional de  sitter branes ( i.e. , of @xmath1 spacetime dimensions ) embedded in the @xmath2-dimensional anti - de sitter bulk , which we shall call the quantum radion , is investigated at the linear perturbation level . </S>",
    "<S> the quantization of the radion is done by deriving the effective action of the radion . assuming the positive tension brane is our universe , the effect of the quantum radion is evaluated by using the effective einstein equations on the brane in which the radion contributes to the effective energy momentum tensor at the linear order of the radion amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the rms effective energy density arising from the quantum radion is compared with the background energy density . </S>",
    "<S> it is found out that this ratio remains small for reasonable values of the parameters of the model even without introducing a stabilizing mechanism for radion , although the radion itself has a negative mass squared and is unstable . </S>",
