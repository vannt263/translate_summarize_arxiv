    "supersolids with both diagonal and off - diagonal long - range order are observed in various model , either with or without hard - core constraint.@xcite one obvious necessary condition for the occurrence of supersolids ( sss ) is the presence of a small but finite kinetic energy in competition with a relatively large repulsive interactions .",
    "previous results suggest that the hard - core constraint may destroy supersolid phases by the formation of domain walls , which leads to phase separation instead.@xcite stable supersolid phases in hard - core models are found , however , in systems contain frustrated interactions.@xcite    the extended bose - hubbard model is a typical example that has been proposed to demonstrate a supersold phase within the mean - field approximation @xcite , and is confirmed by quantum monte carlo simulations.@xcite as long as the next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interaction @xmath2 is dominant , hard - core bosons lining up as stripes to reduce potential energy near half filling @xcite ( see fig .",

    "9 focuses solely on the case with no nn interaction @xmath3 and so only the melting of stripe phases are discussed .",
    "the thermal melting behavior of the star supersolid phases near the quarter filling is then largely unknown .",
    "since the star order is characterized by two structure factors , the two broken translation symmetries can , in principle , be restored simultaneously or at two different temperatures .",
    "the latter scenario means the star phase melts into a stripe phase before changes to a normal fluid or superfluid .",
    "it is also worth to examine whether the missing nematic phase in ref .",

    "more interesting is the coexistence of the stripe order and superfluidity , i.e. , the stripe supersolid phase , in the doped system .",
    "most condensed bosons in this exotic states move in the direction parallel to the stripes but superflow in the perpendicular direction is also observed.@xcite the stripe quantum solid proceeds to the superfluid via two second - order transitions , in contrast to the case of vanishing @xmath2 , where transitions from quantum solid to superfluid are discontinuous .",

    "@xmath47 meet at the same transition points independent of the system size . particularly , the resulted transition points from both cumulant ratios are very close to each other and are indistinguishable within the statistical uncertainties of our data .",
    "our data thus suggest a single second - order transition for the melting of the star quantum solid to the normal - fluid phase , or a very narrow intermediate stripe quantum solid in between the phases .     and @xmath26 as a function of temperature for different system sizes ( @xmath31 , @xmath48).,width=283 ]    to further clarify these two scenarios , we suppose there are two second - order phase transitions that restores the translation symmetries sequentially .",
    "we expect both transitions are in the three - dimensions ising universality class as each transition breaks a z@xmath49 symmetry .",
    "therefore the structure factors should follow the finite size scaling law @xmath50 $ ] with @xmath51 and @xmath52 as expected for the ising class.@xcite the data of @xmath53 for different @xmath39 should intersect at the same temperature that determines the value of @xmath54 . by rescaling the temperature to @xmath55",

    "the critical temperature of @xmath26 is found significantly lower than that of the @xmath27 and therefore suggests an intermediate stripe quantum solid phase .",
    "however , the rescaled data collapse well only for @xmath56 but a clear derivation from the scaling law is observed for temperatures below @xmath54 .",
    "this failure of data collapse invalidates the assumption of two transitions of ising type .",
    "therefore it rules out the possibility of a very narrow intermediate stripe quantum solid phase lies between the star quantum solid and normal - fluid phases .",
    "the melting of the star quantum solid to normal fluid is then likely to be a single second - order transition .",

    "the histogram of @xmath22 ( see the inset ) shows the double peaks feature as a clear signature for a first - order transition .",
    "this discontinuous transition reflects the fact that the star order is more than simply breaking another translational symmetry of the stripe order .",
    "it implies the two broken translational symmetries in the star order are not independent and therefore can not be constructed by breaking the translational symmetries sequentially via two second - order transitions .",

    "this sudden suppress of superfluidity is thus unlikely due to the increase in particle number alone , but may be resulted by the coupling of the broken translational symmetries .",
    "this is also in contrast to the supersolid melting in most systems @xcite where the restoration of superfluid symmetry and translational symmetry are largely independent .",
    "this interesting behavior may be related to the intrinsic structure of the star supersolid and further study is needed to gain more insight of this particular phase .    for larger chemical potential , and particle density",

    "the transitions from the super to normal phases that restore the gauge symmetry are of the kt type in nature .",
    "interestingly , the transition temperature exhibits a sudden drop when the star order emerges .",
    "it differs from the usual supersolid that the superfluid @xmath54 behaves largely independent of the crystal order of the system .",
    "futher exploration of the possible coupling between the broken gauge and translational symmetries should provide more insight of this behavior .    for the melting of star order , our result support the scenario of a single second - order transition instead of two ising - type second - order transitions .",
