    "convex mixtures of a maximally entangled state and a maximally mixed state of two two - level quantum systems ( qubits ) represent undoubtedly the most important mixed test states in quantum information theory .",
    "these states , commonly called werner states @xcite , combine quantum entanglement and classical noise in a simple way that allows for the testing of quantum information criteria , concepts and protocols in the mixed - state domain using analytical tools . originally developed as an example of an entangled state which admits a local - realistic model @xcite , i.e. , a state which does not violate any bell - type inequalities , it was shown later that suitable werner states may exhibit hidden nonlocality @xcite and that a werner state admitting a local - realistic model can exhibit nonlocality in the multicopy scenario @xcite . in the context of separability , werner states have been used to demonstrate that separability criteria based on positive partial transposition @xcite or majorization @xcite are strictly stronger than entropic ones .",
    "furthermore , werner states prove to be suitable initial states for entanglement distillation @xcite .",
    "interestingly , not only entangled werner states play an important role in quantum information ; it turns out that separable werner states can carry non - classical correlations , known as quantum discord @xcite , which can serve as an alternative resource for quantum technology , e.g. , in quantum illumination @xcite .",
    "all aforementioned applications relate to the two - qubit werner states .",
    "an important test state is also obtained when we extend the werner state to systems with an infinite - dimensional hilbert space , such as optical modes .",
    "a two - mode analogue of the werner state , the so called continuous - variable ( cv ) werner state , for two modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 is defined as @xcite @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the two - mode squeezed vacuum state , where @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the @xmath6-th fock state of mode @xmath7 , with @xmath8 and squeezing parameter @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the tensor product of two identical thermal states characterized by the parameter @xmath11 . for @xmath12 and in the strong squeezing limit @xmath13 , the state ( [ wernerinf ] )",
    "represents a direct analogy of the original two - qubit werner state by approaching a convex mixture of a maximally entangled state and a maximally mixed state in an infinite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the cv werner state ( [ wernerinf ] ) is a simple mixed non - gaussian state and therefore proves to be an excellent tool for investigating many concepts in quantum information in the mixed - state non - gaussian scenario .",
    "this involves analyses of separability , teleportation and violation of discrete - variable bell inequalities @xcite , as well as for non - classical correlations beyond entanglement @xcite . besides",
    ", cv werner states have been studied also from the point of view of violation of the cv bell inequalities @xcite , quantification of non - gaussian entanglement by negativity @xcite or optimality of gaussian attacks in cv quantum key distribution @xcite . despite considerable progress in understanding many aspects of the cv werner states ,",
    "their basic separability properties are still not fully known .",
    "analysis of their separability has been performed using the positive partial transposition ( ppt ) criterion @xcite .",
    "the criterion says that any two - mode _ separable _ density matrix @xmath14 has a positive partial transpose @xmath15 , which is a matrix with entries @xmath16 from the ppt criterion it then follows that a quantum state is entangled if its density matrix has a negative partial transpose ( npt ) .",
    "the cv werner state ( [ wernerinf ] ) is exceptional because its npt region can be found analytically @xcite .",
    "however , this region may not contain all entangled cv werner states since ppt entangled states may also exist @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a set of all ppt cv werner states and a nontrivial proper subset of separable states have been found .",
    "therefore , there still exist ppt cv werner states for which the separability properties are not known .",
    "in particular , it is unknown whether ppt entangled cv werner states exist .    in the subsequent sections we answer this existence question in the negative .",
    "first , we prove that any ppt @xmath17-dimensional truncation of the cv werner state ( [ wernerinf ] ) is separable for any finite @xmath17 .",
    "we then show that any ppt cv werner state can be approximated in the trace - norm by a sequence of its truncated separable counterparts , which implies its separability .",
    "the separability of the ppt truncated @xmath18 cv werner states is demonstrated by finding explicitly their decomposition into a convex mixture of pure product states , which is inspired by the method @xcite developed for simpler @xmath19 quantum systems .",
    "contrary to intuition , the projectors onto the constituents of the product states comprise a generalized non - gaussian measurement which yields , for a particular example of the partial transpose of a specific ppt cv werner state , a strictly tighter upper bound on quantum discord than photon counting .    the first result of the present paper closes a long - standing open problem about the existence of ppt cv entangled werner states .",
    "the second result shows that more sophisticated non - gaussian measurements are needed to optimally extract non - classical correlations from non - gaussian quantum states on infinite - dimensional hilbert state spaces .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_2 ]",
    "we prove the separability of all ppt finite - dimensional truncations of cv werner states , while section  [ sec_3 ] is dedicated to the proof of the separability of any ppt cv werner state . in section [ discord ]",
    "we show that photon counting does not minimize quantum discord for a certain family of partially transposed cv werner states .",

    "the first step in finding such a decomposition for @xmath44 is to calculate @xmath48 .",

    "nevertheless , the structure of the decomposition for @xmath44 can still inspire us to find a similar separable decomposition for the state @xmath82 .",

    "all infinite sums encountered in the expressions of entropies have been approximated by @xmath252-th partial sum.,width=283 ]",
    "we have shown that all ppt cv werner states are separable . inspired by a method in @xcite designed for @xmath19 systems",
    "we have first decomposed all ppt truncated @xmath18 cv werner states into a convex mixture of product states , thus proving their separability .",
    "next we have shown that the truncated states approximate , in the trace norm , their infinite - dimensional counterparts , which implies separability of all ppt cv werner states .",
    "finally , we have constructed a generalized non - gaussian measurement from the product states of a cv werner state decomposition and shown that the measurement extracts more non - classical correlations than photon counting , as quantified by quantum discord .",
    "the results presented in this paper reveal a similarity between cv werner states and the original werner states since the ppt condition is equivalent to separability for both @xcite .",
    "this fact may also raise the question of whether werner states share a similarity also for distillability .",
    "in particular , one may ask whether , like in the finite - dimensional case , there are npt cv werner states satisfying the reduction separability criterion @xcite , which would be the candidates for currently hypothetical npt non - distillable entangled states @xcite . the answer to this question",
    "is left for future research .",
    "besides , as the ppt cv werner states considered here are also elements of a larger set of ppt states @xcite possessing a similar structure , the present approach can serve as a recipe on how to analyse separability of other states from this set .",
    "we hope that our results will inspire further studies on separability and non - classical correlations in ppt quantum states both in finite- and infinite - dimensional hilbert state spaces .",
