    "at the time of the birth of general relativity ( gr ) , experimental confirmation was almost a side issue .",
    "einstein did calculate observable effects of general relativity , such as the deflection of light , which were tested , but compared to the inner consistency and elegance of the theory , he regarded such empirical questions as almost peripheral . but",
    "today , experimental gravitation is a major component of the field , characterized by continuing efforts to test the theory s predictions , to search for gravitational imprints of high - energy particle interactions , and to detect gravitational waves from astronomical sources .",
    "the modern history of experimental relativity can be divided roughly into four periods , genesis , hibernation , a golden era , and the quest for strong gravity .",
    "the genesis ( 18871919 ) comprises the period of the two great experiments which were the foundation of relativistic physics  the michelson - morley experiment and the etvs experiment  and the two immediate confirmations of gr  the deflection of light and the perihelion advance of mercury .",
    "following this was a period of hibernation ( 19201960 ) during which relatively few experiments were performed to test gr , and at the same time the field itself became sterile and stagnant , relegated to the backwaters of physics and astronomy .",
    "but beginning around 1960 , astronomical discoveries ( quasars , pulsars , cosmic background radiation ) and new experiments pushed gr to the forefront .",
    "experimental gravitation experienced a golden era ( 19601980 ) during which a systematic , world - wide effort took place to understand the observable predictions of gr , to compare and contrast them with the predictions of alternative theories of gravity , and to perform new experiments to test them .",
    "the period began with an experiment to confirm the gravitational frequency shift of light ( 1960 ) and ended with the reported decrease in the orbital period of the binary pulsar at a rate consistent with the general relativity prediction of gravity - wave energy loss ( 1979 ) . the results all supported gr , and most alternative theories of gravity fell by the wayside ( for a popular review , see ref . ) .",
    "since 1980 , the field has entered what might be termed a quest for strong gravity .",
    "many of the remaining interesting weak - field predictions of the theory are extremely small and difficult to check , in some cases requiring further technological development to bring them into detectable range .",
    "the sense of a systematic assault on the weak - field predictions of gr has been supplanted to some extent by an opportunistic approach in which novel and unexpected ( and sometimes inexpensive ) tests of gravity have arisen from new theoretical ideas or experimental techniques , often from unlikely sources .",
    "examples include the use of laser - cooled atom and ion traps to perform ultra - precise tests of special relativity , and the startling proposal of a `` fifth '' force , which led to a host of new tests of gravity at short ranges .",
    "several major ongoing efforts also continue , principally the stanford gyroscope experiment , known as gravity probe - b .    instead ,",
    "much of the focus has shifted to experiments which can probe the effects of strong gravitational fields . at one extreme",
    "are the strong gravitational fields associated with planck - scale physics",
    ". will unification of the forces , or quantization of gravity at this scale leave observable effects accessible by experiment ?",
    "dramatically improved tests of the equivalence principle or of the `` inverse square law '' are being designed , to search for or bound the imprinted effects of planck scale phenomena . at the other extreme",
    "are the strong fields associated with compact objects such as black holes or neutron stars .",
    "astrophysical observations and gravitational - wave detectors are being planned to explore and test gr in the strong - field , highly - dynamical regime associated with the formation and dynamics of these objects .    in these lectures",
    ", we shall review theoretical frameworks for studying experimental gravitation , summarize the current status of experiments , and attempt to chart the future of the subject .",
    "we shall not provide complete references to work done in this field but instead will refer the reader to the appropriate review articles and monographs , specifically to _ theory and experiment in gravitational physics _",
    "@xcite , hereafter referred to as tegp .",

    "[ eep ]    the principle of equivalence has historically played an important role in the development of gravitation theory .",
    "newton regarded this principle as such a cornerstone of mechanics that he devoted the opening paragraph of the _ principia _ to it . in 1907 , einstein used the principle as a basic element of general relativity .",
    "we now regard the principle of equivalence as the foundation , not of newtonian gravity or of gr , but of the broader idea that spacetime is curved .",
    "one elementary equivalence principle is the kind newton had in mind when he stated that the property of a body called `` mass '' is proportional to the `` weight '' , and is known as the weak equivalence principle ( wep ) .",
    "an alternative statement of wep is that the trajectory of a freely falling body ( one not acted upon by such forces as electromagnetism and too small to be affected by tidal gravitational forces ) is independent of its internal structure and composition . in the simplest case of dropping two different bodies in a gravitational field , wep states that the bodies fall with the same acceleration .",
    "a more powerful and far - reaching equivalence principle is known as the einstein equivalence principle ( eep ) .",
    "it states that ( i )  wep is valid , ( ii )  the outcome of any local non - gravitational experiment is independent of the velocity of the freely - falling reference frame in which it is performed , and ( iii )  the outcome of any local non - gravitational experiment is independent of where and when in the universe it is performed . the second piece of eep is called local lorentz invariance ( lli ) , and the third piece",
    "is called local position invariance ( lpi ) .",
    "for example , a measurement of the electric force between two charged bodies is a local non - gravitational experiment ; a measurement of the gravitational force between two bodies ( cavendish experiment ) is not .",
    "the einstein equivalence principle is the heart and soul of gravitational theory , for it is possible to argue convincingly that if eep is valid , then gravitation must be a `` curved spacetime '' phenomenon , in other words , the effects of gravity must be equivalent to the effects of living in a curved spacetime . as a consequence of this argument ,",
    "the only theories of gravity that can embody eep are those that satisfy the postulates of `` metric theories of gravity '' , which are ( i )  spacetime is endowed with a symmetric metric , ( ii )  the trajectories of freely falling bodies are geodesics of that metric , and ( iii )  in local freely falling reference frames , the non - gravitational laws of physics are those written in the language of special relativity . the argument that leads to this conclusion simply notes that , if eep is valid , then in local freely falling frames , the laws governing experiments must be independent of the velocity of the frame ( local lorentz invariance ) , with constant values for the various atomic constants ( in order to be independent of location ) .",
    "the only laws we know of that fulfill this are those that are compatible with special relativity , such as maxwell s equations of electromagnetism .",
    "furthermore , in local freely falling frames , test bodies appear to be unaccelerated , in other words they move on straight lines ; but such `` locally straight '' lines simply correspond to `` geodesics '' in a curved spacetime ( tegp 2.3 ) .",
    "general relativity is a metric theory of gravity , but then so are many others , including the brans - dicke theory .",
    "the nonsymmetric gravitation theory ( ngt ) of moffat is not a metric theory , neither is superstring theory ( see sec . [ newinteractions ] ) .",
    "so the notion of curved spacetime is a very general and fundamental one , and therefore it is important to test the various aspects of the einstein equivalence principle thoroughly .",
    "a direct test of wep is the comparison of the acceleration of two laboratory - sized bodies of different composition in an external gravitational field .",
    "if the principle were violated , then the accelerations of different bodies would differ . the simplest way to quantify such possible violations of wep in a form suitable for comparison with experiment",
    "is to suppose that for a body with inertial mass @xmath0 , the passive gravitational mass @xmath1 is no longer equal to @xmath0 , so that in a gravitational field @xmath2 , the acceleration is given by @xmath3 .",
    "now the inertial mass of a typical laboratory body is made up of several types of mass - energy : rest energy , electromagnetic energy , weak - interaction energy , and so on .",
    "if one of these forms of energy contributes to @xmath1 differently than it does to @xmath0 , a violation of wep would result .",
    "one could then write @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the internal energy of the body generated by interaction @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is a dimensionless parameter that measures the strength of the violation of wep induced by that interaction , and @xmath8 is the speed of light .",
    "a measurement or limit on the fractional difference in acceleration between two bodies then yields a quantity called the `` etvs ratio '' given by @xmath9 where we drop the subscript i from the inertial masses .",
    "thus , experimental limits on @xmath10 place limits on the wep - violation parameters @xmath7 .",
    "many high - precision etvs - type experiments have been performed , from the pendulum experiments of newton , bessel and potter , to the classic torsion - balance measurements of etvs , dicke , braginsky and their collaborators . in the modern torsion - balance experiments ,",
    "two objects of different composition are connected by a rod or placed on a tray and suspended in a horizontal orientation by a fine wire .",
    "if the gravitational acceleration of the bodies differs , there will be a torque induced on the suspension wire , related to the angle between the wire and the direction of the gravitational acceleration @xmath11 .",
    "if the entire apparatus is rotated about some direction with angular velocity @xmath12 , the torque will be modulated with period @xmath13 . in the experiments of etvs and his collaborators , the wire and @xmath11 were not quite parallel because of the centripetal acceleration on the apparatus due to the earth s rotation ; the apparatus was rotated about the direction of the wire . in the princeton ( dicke ) , and moscow ( braginsky ) experiments , @xmath11 was that of the sun , and the rotation of the earth provided the modulation of the torque at a period of 24  hr ( tegp 2.4(a ) ) .",
    "beginning in the late 1980s , numerous experiments were carried out primarily to search for a `` fifth force '' ( see sec .",
    "[ newinteractions ] ) , but their null results also constituted tests of wep . in the `` free - fall galileo experiment '' performed at the university of colorado , the relative free - fall acceleration of two bodies made of uranium and copper was measured using a laser interferometric technique .",
    "the `` et - wash '' experiment carried out at the university of washington used a sophisticated torsion balance tray to compare the accelerations of beryllium and copper toward local topography on earth , movable laboratory masses , the sun and the galaxy.@xcite the resulting upper limits on @xmath10 are summarized in figure 1 ( tegp 14.1 ; for a bibliography of experiments , see ref . .",
    "the second ingredient of eep , local lorentz invariance , can be said to be tested every time that special relativity is confirmed in the laboratory",
    ". however , many such experiments , especially in high - energy physics , are not `` clean '' tests , because in many cases it is unlikely that a violation of lorentz invariance could be distinguished from effects due to the complicated strong and weak interactions .",
    "however , there is one class of experiments that can be interpreted as `` clean '' , high - precision tests of local lorentz invariance .",
    "these are the `` mass anisotropy '' experiments : the classic versions are the hughes - drever experiments , performed in the period 1959 - 60 independently by hughes and collaborators at yale university , and by drever at glasgow university ( tegp 2.4(b ) ) .",
    "dramatically improved versions were carried out during the late 1980s using laser - cooled trapped atom techniques ( tegp 14.1 ) .",
    "a simple and useful way of interpreting these experiments is to suppose that the electromagnetic interactions suffer a slight violation of lorentz invariance , through a change in the speed of electromagnetic radiation @xmath8 relative to the limiting speed of material test particles ( @xmath14 , chosen to be unity via a choice of units ) , in other words , @xmath15 ( see sec .",
    "[ c2formalism ] ) .",
    "such a violation necessarily selects a preferred universal rest frame , presumably that of the cosmic background radiation , through which we are moving at about 300  km / s .",
    "such a lorentz - non - invariant electromagnetic interaction would cause shifts in the energy levels of atoms and nuclei that depend on the orientation of the quantization axis of the state relative to our universal velocity vector , and on the quantum numbers of the state .",
    "the presence or absence of such energy shifts can be examined by measuring the energy of one such state relative to another state that is either unaffected or is affected differently by the supposed violation .",
    "one way is to look for a shifting of the energy levels of states that are ordinarily equally spaced , such as the four @xmath16 ground states of the @xmath17li nucleus in a magnetic field ( drever experiment ) ; another is to compare the levels of a complex nucleus with the atomic hyperfine levels of a hydrogen maser clock .",
    "these experiments have all yielded extremely accurate results , quoted as limits on the parameter @xmath18 in figure 2 . also included for comparison",
    "is the corresponding limit obtained from michelson - morley type experiments .",
    "recent advances in atomic spectroscopy and atomic timekeeping have made it possible to test lli by checking the isotropy of the speed of light using one - way propagation ( as opposed to round - trip propagation , as in the michelson - morley experiment ) . in one experiment , for example ,",
    "the relative phases of two hydrogen maser clocks at two stations of nasa s deep space tracking network were compared over five rotations of the earth by propagating a light signal one - way along an ultrastable fiberoptic link connecting them ( see sec .",
    "[ c2formalism ] ) .",
    "although the bounds from these experiments are not as tight as those from mass - anisotropy experiments , they probe directly the fundamental postulates of special relativity , and thereby of lli .",
    "( tegp 14.1 ) .",
    "the principle of local position invariance , the third part of eep , can be tested by the gravitational redshift experiment , the first experimental test of gravitation proposed by einstein . despite the fact that einstein regarded this as a crucial test of gr , we now realize that it does not distinguish between gr and any other metric theory of gravity , instead is a test only of eep .",
    "a typical gravitational redshift experiment measures the frequency or wavelength shift @xmath19 between two identical frequency standards ( clocks ) placed at rest at different heights in a static gravitational field .",
    "if the frequency of a given type of atomic clock is the same when measured in a local , momentarily comoving freely falling frame ( lorentz frame ) , independent of the location or velocity of that frame , then the comparison of frequencies of two clocks at rest at different locations boils down to a comparison of the velocities of two local lorentz frames , one at rest with respect to one clock at the moment of emission of its signal , the other at rest with respect to the other clock at the moment of reception of the signal .",
    "the frequency shift is then a consequence of the first - order doppler shift between the frames .",
    "the structure of the clock plays no role whatsoever .",
    "the result is a shift @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the difference in the newtonian gravitational potential between the receiver and the emitter .",
    "if lpi is not valid , then it turns out that the shift can be written @xmath22 where the parameter @xmath23 may depend upon the nature of the clock whose shift is being measured ( see tegp 2.4(c ) for details ) .",
    "the first successful , high - precision redshift measurement was the series of pound - rebka - snider experiments of 1960 - 1965 , that measured the frequency shift of gamma - ray photons from @xmath24fe as they ascended or descended the jefferson physical laboratory tower at harvard university . the high accuracy achieved ",
    "one percent  was obtained by making use of the mssbauer effect to produce a narrow resonance line whose shift could be accurately determined . other experiments since 1960 measured the shift of spectral lines in the sun s gravitational field and the change in rate of atomic clocks transported aloft on aircraft , rockets and satellites .",
    "figure 3 summarizes the important redshift experiments that have been performed since 1960 ( tegp 2.4(c ) ) .",
    "the most precise experiment to date was the vessot - levine rocket redshift experiment that took place in june 1976 .",
    "a hydrogen - maser clock was flown on a rocket to an altitude of about 10,000  km and its frequency compared to a similar clock on the ground .",
    "the experiment took advantage of the masers frequency stability by monitoring the frequency shift as a function of altitude . a sophisticated data acquisition scheme accurately eliminated all effects of the first - order doppler shift due to the rocket s motion , while tracking data were used to determine the payload s location and the velocity ( to evaluate the potential difference @xmath21 , and the special relativistic time dilation )",
    ". analysis of the data yielded a limit @xmath25 .    a `` null '' redshift experiment performed in 1978 tested whether the _ relative _ rates of two different clocks depended upon position .",
    "two hydrogen maser clocks and an ensemble of three superconducting - cavity stabilized oscillator ( scso ) clocks were compared over a 10-day period . during this period ,",
    "the solar potential @xmath26 changed sinusoidally with a 24-hour period by @xmath27 because of the earth s rotation , and changed linearly at @xmath28 per day because the earth is 90 degrees from perihelion in april .",
    "however , analysis of the data revealed no variations of either type within experimental errors , leading to a limit on the lpi violation parameter @xmath29 .",
    "this bound is likely to be improved using more stable frequency standards .",
    "@xcite the varying gravitational redshift of earth - bound clocks relative to the highly stable millisecond pulsar , caused by the earth s motion in the solar gravitational field around the earth - moon center of mass ( amplitude 4000  km ) , has been measured to about 10 percent , and the redshift of stable oscillator clocks on the voyager spacecraft caused by saturn s gravitational field yielded a one percent test .",
    "the solar gravitational redshift has been tested to about two percent using infrared oxygen triplet lines at the limb of the sun , and to one percent using oscillator clocks on the galileo spacecraft ( tegp 2.4(c ) and 14.1(a ) ) .",
    "modern advances in navigation using earth - orbiting atomic clocks and accurate time - transfer must routinely take gravitational redshift and time - dilation effects into account .",
    "for example , the global positioning system ( gps ) provides absolute accuracies of around 15 m ( even better in its military mode ) anywhere on earth , which corresponds to 50 nanoseconds in time accuracy at all times . yet",
    "the difference in rate between satellite and ground clocks as a result of special and general relativistic effects is a whopping 40 _ microseconds _ per day ( @xmath30s from the gravitational redshift , and @xmath31s from time dilation ) . if these effects were not accurately accounted for , gps would fail to function at its stated accuracy .",
    "this represents a welcome practical application of gr !    local position invariance also refers to position in time .",
    "if lpi is satisfied , the fundamental constants of non - gravitational physics should be constants in time . table 1 shows current bounds on cosmological variations in selected dimensionless constants . for discussion and references to early work ,",
    "see tegp 2.4(c ) .    [ variation ]    .bounds on cosmological variation of fundamental constants of non - gravitational physics .",
    "for references to earlier work , see tegp 2.4(c ) . [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     _ psr 1534 + 12_. this is a binary pulsar system in our galaxy .",
    "its pulses are significantly stronger and narrower than those of psr 1913 + 16 , so timing measurements are more precise , reaching @xmath32 accuracy .",
    "its parameters are listed in table 6.@xcite the orbital plane appears to be almost edge - on relative to the line of sight ( @xmath33 ) ; as a result the shapiro delay is substantial , and separate values of the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 have been obtained with interesting accuracy . assuming general relativity ,",
    "one infers that the two masses are virtually identical at @xmath36 .",
    "the rate of orbit decay @xmath37 agrees with gr to about 15 percent , the precision limited by the poorly known distance to the pulsar , which introduces a significant uncertainty into the subtraction of galactic acceleration .",
    "_ psr 2127 + 11c .",
    "_ this system appears to be a clone of the hulse - taylor binary pulsar , with very similar values for orbital period and eccentricity ( see table 7 ) .",
    "the inferred total mass of the system is @xmath38 .",
    "because the system is in the globular cluster m15 ( ngc 7078 ) , it will suffer doppler shifts resulting from local accelerations , either by the mean cluster gravitational field or by nearby stars , that are more difficult to estimate than was the case with the galactic system psr 1913 + 16 .",
    "this may make a separate , precision measurement of the relativistic contribution to @xmath37 impossible .",
    "_ psr 1855 + 09_. this binary pulsar system is not particularly relativistic , with a long period ( 12 days ) and highly circular orbit .",
    "however , because we observe the orbit nearly edge on , the shapiro delay is large and measurable , as reflected in the post - keplerian parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "soon after the discovery of the binary pulsar it was widely hailed as a new testing ground for relativistic gravitational effects . as we have seen in the case of gr , in most respects , the system has lived up to , indeed exceeded , the early expectations .    in another respect , however , the system has only partially lived up to its promise , namely as a direct testing ground for alternative theories of gravity .",
    "the origin of this promise was the discovery that alternative theories of gravity generically predict the emission of dipole gravitational radiation from binary star systems .",
    "this additional form of gravitational radiation damping could , at least in principle , be significantly stronger than the usual quadrupole damping , because it depends on fewer powers of the parameter @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the orbital velocity and @xmath8 is the speed of light , and it depends on the gravitational binding energy per unit mass of the bodies , which , for neutron stars , could be as large as 40 per cent . as one fulfillment of this promise , will and eardley worked out in detail the effects of dipole gravitational radiation in the bimetric theory of rosen , and , when the first observation of the decrease of the orbital period was announced in 1978 , the rosen theory suffered a terminal blow ( tegp 12.3 ) . a wide class of alternative theories also fail the binary pulsar test because of dipole gravitational radiation .",
    "on the other hand , the early observations already indicated that , in gr , the masses of the two bodies were nearly equal , so that , in theories of gravity that are in some sense `` close '' to gr , dipole gravitational radiation would not be a strong effect , because of the apparent symmetry of the system ( technically , the amount of dipole radiation depends on the difference between the gravitational binding energy per unit mass for the two bodies ) .",
    "the rosen theory , and others like it , are not `` close '' to general relativity , except in their predictions for the weak - field , slow - motion regime of the solar system .",
    "when relativistic neutron stars are present , theories like these can predict strong effects on the motion of the bodies resulting from their internal highly relativistic gravitational structure ( violations of the strong equivalence principle ) . as a consequence",
    ", the masses inferred from observations such as the periastron shift may be significantly different from those inferred using general relativity , and may be different from each other , leading to strong dipole gravitational radiation damping .",
    "by contrast , the brans - dicke theory , which was the basis for eardley s discovery of the dipole radiation phenomenon , is `` close '' to gr , roughly speaking within @xmath41 of the predictions of the latter , for large values of the coupling constant @xmath42 ( henceforth this notation for the coupling constant is adopted to avoid confusion with the periastron angle ) .",
    "thus , despite the presence of dipole gravitational radiation , the binary pulsar provides at present only a weak test of brans - dicke theory , not yet competitive with solar - system tests .      making the usual assumption that both members of the system are neutron stars , and using the methods summarized in tegp chapters 1012 , one can obtain formulas for the periastron shift , the gravitational redshift / second - order doppler shift parameter , and the rate of change of orbital period , analogous to equations [ e43][e45 ] .",

    "the ligo broad - band antennae will have the capability of detecting and measuring the gravitational waveforms from astronomical sources in a frequency band between about 10 hz ( the seismic noise cutoff ) and 500 hz ( the photon counting noise cutoff ) , with a maximum sensitivity to strain at around 100 hz of @xmath69 ( rms ) .",
    "the most promising source for detection and study of the gravitational - wave signal is the `` inspiralling compact binary ''  a binary system of neutron stars or black holes ( or one of each ) in the final minutes of a death dance leading to a violent merger .",
    "such is the fate , for example of the hulse - taylor binary pulsar psr 1913 + 16 in about 300 m years . given the expected sensitivity of the `` advanced ligo '' ( around 2007 ) , which could see such sources out to hundreds of megaparsecs , it has been estimated that from 3 to 100 annual inspiral events could be detectable .",
    "other sources , such as supernova core collapse events , instabilities in rapidly rotating nascent neutron stars , signals from non - axisymmetric pulsars , and a stochastic background of waves , may be detectable ( for reviews , see ref .",
    "and articles in this volume ) .",
    "detailed observation of gravitational waves from such sources may provide the means to test general relativistic predictions for the polarization and speed of the waves , and for gravitational radiation damping .",
    "several of these tests can be realized using gravitational - waves from inspiralling compact binaries .",
    "the analysis of gravitational - wave data from such sources will involve some form of matched filtering of the noisy detector output against an ensemble of theoretical `` template '' waveforms which depend on the intrinsic parameters of the inspiralling binary , such as the component masses , spins , and so on , and on its inspiral evolution .",
    "how accurate must a template be in order to `` match '' the waveform from a given source ( where by a match we mean maximizing the cross - correlation or the signal - to - noise ratio ) ? in the total accumulated phase of the wave detected in the sensitive bandwidth , the template must match the signal to a fraction of a cycle . for two inspiralling neutron stars , around 16,000 cycles",
    "should be detected ; this implies a phasing accuracy of @xmath70 or better . since @xmath71 during the late inspiral , this means that correction terms in the phasing at the level of @xmath72 or higher are needed .",
    "more formal analyses confirm this intuition.@xcite    because it is a slow - motion system ( @xmath73 ) , the binary pulsar is sensitive only to the lowest - order effects of gravitational radiation as predicted by the quadrupole formula .",
    "nevertheless , the first correction terms of order @xmath39 and @xmath74 to the quadrupole formula , were calculated as early as 1976 ( tegp 10.3 ) .",
    "these are now conventionally called `` post - newtonian '' ( pn ) corrections , with each power of @xmath39 corresponding to half a post - newtonian order ( 1/2pn ) , in analogy with post - newtonian corrections to the newtonian equations of motion.@xcite    but for laser - interferometric observations of gravitational waves , the bottom line is that , in order to measure the astrophysical parameters of the source and to test the properties of the gravitational waves , it is necessary to derive the gravitational waveform and the resulting radiation back - reaction on the orbit phasing at least to 2pn , or second post - newtonian order , @xmath75 $ ] , beyond the quadrupole approximation , and probably to 3pn order .",
    "the generation of gravitational radiation is a long - standing problem that dates back to the first years following the publication of gr , when einstein calculated the gravitational radiation emitted by a laboratory - scale object using the linearized version of gr . shortly after the discovery of the binary pulsar psr 1913 + 16 in 1974",
    ", questions were raised about the foundations of the `` quadrupole formula '' for gravitational radiation damping ( and in some quarters , even about its quantitative validity ) .",
    "these questions were answered in part by theoretical work designed to shore up the foundations of the quadrupole approximation,@xcite and in part ( perhaps mostly ) by the agreement between the predictions of the quadrupole formula and the _ observed _ rate of damping of the pulsar s orbit . in 1976 , the post - newtonian corrections to the quadrupole formula were of purely academic , rather than observational interest .",
    "the challenge of providing accurate templates for ligo - virgo data analysis has led to major efforts to calculate gravitational waves to high pn order .",
    "three approaches have been developed .",
    "the bdi approach of blanchet , damour and iyer is based on a mixed post - newtonian and `` post - minkowskian '' framework for solving einstein s equations approximately , developed in a long series of papers by damour and colleagues.@xcite the idea is to solve the vacuum einstein equations in the exterior of the material sources extending out to the radiation zone in an expansion ( `` post - minkowskian '' ) in `` nonlinearity '' ( effectively an expansion in powers of newton s constant @xmath55 ) , and to express the asymptotic solutions in terms of a set of formal , time - dependent , symmetric and trace - free ( stf ) multipole moments.@xcite then , in a near zone within one characteristic wavelength of the radiation , the equations including the material source are solved in a slow - motion approximation ( expansion in powers of @xmath76 ) that yields a set of stf source multipole moments expressed as integrals over the `` effective '' source , including both matter and gravitational field contributions .",
    "the solutions involving the two sets of moments are then matched in an intermediate zone , resulting in a connection between the formal radiative moments and the source moments .",
    "the matching also provides a natural way , using analytic continuation , to regularize integrals involving the non - compact contributions of gravitational stress - energy , that might otherwise be divergent .",
    "an approach called dire is based on a framework developed by epstein and wagoner ( ew)@xcite , and extended by will , wiseman and pati .",
    "we shall describe dire briefly below .",
    "a third approach , valid only in the limit in which one mass is much smaller than the other , is that of black - hole perturbation theory .",
    "this method provides numerical results that are exact in @xmath39 , as well as analytical results expressed as series in powers of @xmath39 , both for non - rotating and for rotating black holes . for non - rotating holes ,",
    "the analytical expansions have been carried to _ 5.5 _ pn order.@xcite in all cases of suitable overlap , the results of all three methods agree precisely .      like the bdi approach ,",
    "dire involves rewriting the einstein equations in their `` relaxed '' form , namely as an inhomogeneous , flat - spacetime wave equation for a field @xmath77 , whose formal solution can be written @xmath78 where the source @xmath79 consists of both the material stress - energy , and a `` gravitational stress - energy '' made up of all the terms non - linear in @xmath77 , and the integration is over the past flat - spacetime null - cone @xmath80 of the field point @xmath81 ( see fig . 7 )",
    "the wave equation is accompanied by a harmonic or dedonder gauge condition @xmath82 , which serves to specify a coordinate system , and also imposes equations of motion on the sources . unlike the bdi approach , a _ single _",
    "formal solution is written down , valid everywhere in spacetime .",
    "this formal solution , is then iterated in a slow - motion ( @xmath83 ) , weak - field ( @xmath84 ) approximation , that is very similar to the corresponding procedure in electromagnetism .",
    "however , because the integrand of this retarded integral is not compact by virture of the non - linear field contributions , the original ew formalism quickly runs up against integrals that are not well defined , or worse , are divergent .",
    "although at the lowest quadrupole and first few pn orders , various arguments can be given to justify sweeping such problems under the rug,@xcite they are not very rigorous , and provide no guarantee that the divergences do not become insurmountable at higher orders . as a consequence , despite efforts to cure the problem , the ew formalism fell into some disfavor as a route to higher orders ,",
    "although an extension to 3/2pn order was accomplished.@xcite    the resolution of this problem involves taking literally the statement that the solution is a _ retarded _ integral , _",
    "i.e. _ an integral over the",
    "_ entire _ past null cone of the field point.@xcite to be sure , that part of the integral that extends over the intersection @xmath85 between the past null cone and the material source and the near zone is still approximated as usual by a slow - motion expansion involving spatial integrals over @xmath86 of moments of the source , including the non - compact gravitational contributions , just as in the bdi framework ( fig . 8) .",
    "but instead of cavalierly extending the spatial integrals to infinity as was implicit in the original ew framework , and risking undefined or divergent integrals , we terminate the integrals at the boundary of the near zone , chosen to be at a radius @xmath87 given roughly by one wavelength of the gravitational radiation . for the integral over the rest of the past null cone exterior to the near zone ( `` radiation zone '' ) ,",
    "we neither make a slow - motion expansion nor continue to integrate over a spatial hypersurface , instead we use a coordinate transformation in the integral from the spatial coordinates @xmath88 to quasi - null coordinates @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , where @xmath92 to convert the integral into a convenient , easy - to - calculate form , that is manifestly convergent , subject only to reasonable assumptions about the past behavior of the source : @xmath93 ^ 2 d^2 \\omega^\\prime \\,.\\ ] ]    this transformation was suggested by earlier work on a non - linear gravitational - wave phenomenon called the christodoulou memory.@xcite not only are all integrations now explicitly finite and convergent , one can show that all contributions from the finite , near - zone spatial integrals that depend upon @xmath87 are actually _ cancelled _ by corresponding terms from the radiation - zone integrals , valid for both positive and negative powers of @xmath87 and for terms logarithmic in @xmath87.@xcite thus the procedure , as expected , has no dependence on the artificially chosen boundary radius @xmath87 of the near - zone .",
    "in addition , the method can be carried to higher orders in a straightforward manner .",
    "the result is a manifestly finite , well - defined procedure for calculating gravitational radiation to high orders .",
    "the result of the dire or bdi calculations is an explicit formula for two - body systems in general orbits , for the transverse - traceless ( tt ) part of the radiation - zone field , denoted @xmath94 , and representing the deviation of the metric from flat spacetime . in terms of an expansion beyond the quadrupole formula , it has the schematic form , @xmath95 \\right\\ } _ { tt } \\",
    ", , \\label{1 - 1}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is the reduced mass , @xmath97 is the distance to the source , and @xmath98 represents two time derivatives of the mass quadrupole moment tensor ( the series actually contains multipole orders beyond quadrupole ) .",
    "the expansion parameter @xmath99 is related to the orbital variables by @xmath100 , where @xmath34 is the distance between the bodies , @xmath40 is the relative velocity , and @xmath101 is the total mass ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the 1/2pn and 1pn terms were derived by wagoner and will,@xcite the 3/2pn terms by wiseman.@xcite the contribution of gravitational - wave `` tails '' , caused by backscatter of the outgoing radiation off the background spacetime curvature , at @xmath103 , were derived and studied by several authors .",
    "the 2pn terms including 2pn tail contributions were derived by two independent groups and are in complete agreement ( see refs . for details and references to earlier work ) .",
    "there are also contributions to the waveform due to intrinsic spin of the bodies , which occur at @xmath103 ( spin - orbit ) and @xmath104 ( spin - spin ) ; these have been calculated elsewhere.@xcite    given the gravitational waveform , one can compute the rate at which energy is carried off by the radiation ( schematically @xmath105 , the gravitational analog of the poynting flux ) .",
    "for the special case of non - spinning bodies moving on quasi - circular orbits ( _ i.e. _ circular apart from a slow inspiral ) , the energy flux through 2pn order has the form @xmath106 \\ ; , \\label{edot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 .",
    "the first term is the quadrupole contribution , the second term is the 1pn contribution , the third term , with the coefficient @xmath108 , is the `` tail '' contribution , and the fourth term is the 2pn contribution first reported jointly by blanchet _",
    "et al._@xcite calculation of the 3pn contributions is nearing completion .",
    "similar expressions can be derived for the loss of angular momentum and linear momentum .",
    "these losses react back on the orbit to circularize it and cause it to inspiral .",
    "the result is that the orbital phase ( and consequently the gravitational - wave phase ) evolves non - linearly with time .",
    "it is the sensitivity of the broad - band ligo and virgo - type detectors to phase that makes the higher - order contributions to @xmath109 so observationally relevant .",
    "a ready - to - use set of formulae for the 2pn gravitational waveform template , including the non - linear evolution of the gravitational - wave frequency ( not including spin effects ) have been published@xcite and incorporated into the gravitational radiation analysis and simulation package ( grasp ) , a publically available software toolkit.@xcite      a laser - interferometric or resonant bar gravitational - wave detector measures the local components of a symmetric @xmath110 tensor which is composed of the `` electric '' components of the riemann tensor , @xmath111 .",
    "these six independent components can be expressed in terms of polarizations ( modes with specific transformation properties under null rotations ) .",
    "three are transverse to the direction of propagation , with two representing quadrupolar deformations and one representing a monopole `` breathing '' deformation .",
    "three modes are longitudinal , with one an axially symmetric stretching mode in the propagation direction , and one quadrupolar mode in each of the two orthogonal planes containing the propagation direction .",
    "general relativity predicts only the first two transverse quadrupolar modes , independently of the source , while scalar - tensor gravitational waves can in addition contain the transverse breathing mode .",
    "more general metric theories predict up to the full complement of six modes ( tegp 10.2 ) .",
    "a suitable array of gravitational antennas could delineate or limit the number of modes present in a given wave .",
    "the strategy depends on whether or not the source direction is known .",
    "in general there are eight unknowns ( six polarizations and two direction cosines ) , but only six measurables ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "if the direction can be established by either association of the waves with optical or other observations , or by time - of - flight measurements between separated detectors , then six suitably oriented detectors suffice to determine all six components . if the direction can not be established , then the system is underdetermined , and no unique solution can be found .",
    "however , if one assumes that only transverse waves are present , then there are only three unknowns if the source direction is known , or five unknowns otherwise .",
    "then the corresponding number ( three or five ) of detectors can determine the polarization .",
    "if distinct evidence were found of any mode other than the two transverse quadrupolar modes of gr , the result would be disastrous for gr .",
    "on the other hand , the absence of a breathing mode would not necessarily rule out scalar - tensor gravity , because the strength of that mode depends on the nature of the source .",
    "although some of the details of implementing such polarization observations have been worked out for arrays of resonant cylindrical , disk - shaped , and spherical detectors ( tegp 10.2 , ref . ) only initial work has been done to assess whether the ground - based laser - interferometers ( ligo , virgo , geo600 , tama300 ) could perform interesting polarization measurements .",
    "the results depend sensitively on the relative orientation of the detectors arms , which are now cast ( literally ) in concrete .      according to gr , in the limit",
    "in which the wavelength of gravitational waves is small compared to the radius of curvature of the background spacetime , the waves propagate along null geodesics of the background spacetime , _",
    "i.e. _ they have the same speed , @xmath8 , as light ( henceforth , we do not set @xmath112 ) .",
    "in other theories , the speed could differ from @xmath8 because of coupling of gravitation to `` background '' gravitational fields .",
    "for example , in the rosen bimetric theory with a flat background metric @xmath113 , gravitational waves follow null geodesics of @xmath113 , while light follows null geodesics of @xmath114 ( tegp 10.1 ) .",
    "another way in which the speed of gravitational waves could differ from @xmath8 is if gravitation were propagated by a massive field ( a massive graviton ) , in which case , @xmath115 would be given by , in a local inertial frame , @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the graviton rest mass and energy , respectively . for a recent review of the idea of a massive graviton see ref . .",
    "the most obvious way to test this is to compare the arrival times of a gravitational wave and an electromagnetic wave from the same event , _",
    "e.g. _ a supernova . for a source at a distance @xmath119 , the resulting value of the difference",
    "@xmath120 is @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the `` time difference '' , where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the differences in arrival time and emission time , respectively , of the two signals , and @xmath125 is the redshift of the source . in many cases",
    ", @xmath124 is unknown , so that the best one can do is employ an upper bound on @xmath124 based on observation or modelling .",
    "the result will then be a bound on @xmath120 .    for a massive graviton , if the frequency of the gravitational waves is such that @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is planck s constant , then @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the graviton compton wavelength , and the bound on @xmath120 can be converted to a bound on @xmath130 , given by @xmath131    the foregoing discussion assumes that the source emits _ both _ gravitational and electromagnetic radiation in detectable amounts , and that the relative time of emission can be established to sufficient accuracy , or can be shown to be sufficiently small .",
    "however , there is a situation in which a bound on the graviton mass can be set using gravitational radiation alone.@xcite that is the case of the inspiralling compact binary . because the frequency of the gravitational radiation sweeps from low frequency at the initial moment of observation to higher frequency at the final moment , the speed of the gravitons emitted will vary , from lower speeds initially to higher speeds ( closer to @xmath8 ) at the end",
    "this will cause a distortion of the observed phasing of the waves and result in a shorter than expected overall time @xmath123 of passage of a given number of cycles .",
    "furthermore , through the technique of matched filtering , the parameters of the compact binary can be measured accurately , ( assuming that gr is a good approximation to the orbital evolution , even in the presence of a massive graviton ) , and thereby the emission time @xmath124 can be determined accurately .",
    "roughly speaking , the `` phase interval '' @xmath132 in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) can be measured to an accuracy @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "thus one can estimate the bounds on @xmath130 achievable for various compact inspiral systems , and for various detectors . for stellar - mass inspiral ( neutron stars or black holes )",
    "observed by the ligo / virgo class of ground - based interferometers , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 .",
    "the result is @xmath138 . for supermassive binary black holes ( @xmath139 to @xmath140 )",
    "observed by the proposed laser - interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 .",
    "the result is @xmath144 .",
    "a full noise analysis using proposed noise curves for the advanced ligo and for lisa weakens these crude bounds by factors between two and 10 .",
    "these potential bounds can be compared with the solid bound @xmath145 , derived from solar system dynamics , which limit the presence of a yukawa modification of newtonian gravity of the form @xmath146 , @xcite and with the model - dependent bound @xmath147 from consideration of galactic and cluster dynamics @xcite .",
    "this plays an important role only in the inspiral of compact objects .",
    "the equations of motion of inspiral include the non - radiative , non - linear post - newtonian corrections of newtonian motion , as well as radiation back - reaction and its non - linear post - newtonian corrections .",
    "the evolution of the orbit is imprinted on the phasing of the inspiral waveform , to which broad - band laser interferometers are especially sensitive through the use of matched filtering of the data against theoretical templates derived from gr.@xcite a number of tests of gr using matched filtering of binary inspiral have been discussed , including putting a bound on scalar - tensor gravity @xcite , measuring the non - linear `` tail term '' in gravitational radiation damping @xcite ( the `` @xmath108 '' term in eq .",
    "( [ edot ] ) ) , and testing the gr `` no hair '' theorems by mapping spacetime outside black holes @xcite .",
    "for example , the dipole gravitational radiation predicted by scalar - tensor theories results in modifications in gravitational - radiation back - reaction . the effects are strongest for systems involving a neutron star and a black hole .",
    "double neutron star systems are less promising because the small range of masses available near @xmath148 results in suppression of dipole radiation by symmetry .",
    "double black - hole systems turn out to be observationally identical in the two theories .",
    "for example , for a @xmath149 neutron star and a @xmath150 ( @xmath151 ) black hole at 200 mpc , the bound on @xmath42 could be 600 ( 1800 ) ( using advanced ligo noise curves ) .",
    "the bound increases linearly with signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "if one demands that this test be performed annually , thus requiring observation of frequent , and therefore more distant , weaker sources , the bounds on @xmath42 will be too weak to compete with existing bounds .",
    "however , if one is prepared to wait 10 years for the lucky observation of a nearby , strong source , the resulting bound could exceed the current bound .",
    "the bounds are illustrated in figure 10 by the curves marked @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "figure 10 assumes a double - neutron - star inspiral rate of @xmath154 per year per galaxy , and a black - hole - neutron - star rate @xmath155 times that , where @xmath155 is highly uncertain .",
    "in 1998 we find that general relativity has held up under extensive experimental scrutiny .",
    "the question then arises , why bother to continue to test it ?",
    "one reason is that gravity is a fundamental interaction of nature , and as such requires the most solid empirical underpinning we can provide .",
    "another is that all attempts to quantize gravity and to unify it with the other forces suggest that the standard general relativity of einstein is not likely to be the last word .",
    "furthermore , the predictions of general relativity are fixed ; the theory contains no adjustable constants so nothing can be changed .",
    "thus every test of the theory is either a potentially deadly test or a possible probe for new physics .",
    "although it is remarkable that this theory , born 80 years ago out of almost pure thought , has managed to survive every test , the possibility of finding a discrepancy will continue to drive experiments for years to come .",
