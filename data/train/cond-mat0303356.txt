    "quenched disorder and dynamical disorder play an important role in the properties of many physical systems .",
    "some examples that illustrate this role in a variety of very different contexts and support the wide interest in the subject of disorder include the propagation of fronts in porous media  @xcite , the conduction properties of doped semiconductors materials  @xcite , the shift of the curie temperature in ferromagnets  @xcite , and the so - called anderson localization transition  @xcite .    at the same time , another broad field of perennial interest is pattern formation  @xcite because spatio - temporal structures are omnipresent in the physical world  @xcite .",
    "our own recent contributions in this field involve the discovery of novel mechanisms for the appearance of spatio - temporal structures upon periodic or random global alternation of pattern - free dynamics  @xcite .",
    "herein we coadunate these two topics by investigating conditions under wich the presence of quenched disorder is the mechanism that triggers pattern formation . thus our interest lies in a particular type of purely - noise - induced phenomenon : the appearance of patterns in disordered systems which in an ordered state exhibit _ no _ pattern formation .",
    "we concentrate on systems with quenched dichotomous disorder and coupling term _ a la _ swift - hohenberg  @xcite , although one can easily envision generalizations of the formalism to other kinds of disorder and/or coupling terms .",
    "noise - induced phenomena in spatially extended systems have been particularly active areas of investigation in the recent past  @xcite . among these",
    "are phenomena involving pattern formation _ induced purely by fluctuations _  @xcite .",
    "the word `` purely '' here emphasises the fact that the control parameter that determines the presence or absence of patterns is the noise intensity . moreover , if the noise term is replaced by a non - fluctuating parameter , no spatio - temporal structures develop for _ any _ value of that parameter .",
    "our study differs from these previous ones in that we consider quenched spatial disorder , that is , the fluctuations have no temporal dependence .    instead of focusing on a specific system at the outset , we explore some general conditions under which these systems exhibit purely disorder induced patterns .",
    "we then illustrate our findings with a family of systems that includes the paradigmatic models of noise - induced phase transitions  @xcite and noise - induced spatial patterns  @xcite .",
    "we also identify a phenomenon in our system that has previously only been identified in systems with colored noise  @xcite or field - dependent kinetic coefficients  @xcite , namely , a re - entrant behavior with increasing coupling strength . in other words",
    ", we find that increasing the coupling strength leads to non - monotonic behavior such that the patterns are most prominent for a finite value of the coupling and disappear altogether when coupling is too strong ( or too weak ) . as in second and first order phase transitions in equilibrium systems ,",
    "the re - entrance phenomenon can be either continuous ( second order behavior ) or it may present multi - stability and associated hysteresis ( first order behavior ) .",

    "we are therefore restricted to choose as an order parameter the value of the power spectrum at @xmath61 : @xmath194 within our theory @xmath195 and @xmath187 are the same . when there is no pattern they are both zero and their ratio is undefined . when there is a pattern , @xmath196 .",

    "the patterns thus become less pronounced but more coherent with increasing coupling . a representation of @xmath219 , shown in the second panel of fig .",

    "although we do not necessarily expect quantitative agreement with the particular values of parameters that lead to hysteresis , the question is whether hysteresis is observed at all .",

    "we carry out two simulations . in one , starting from an unpatterned initial condition @xmath220 for all @xmath221 , we calculate the total power spectrum in the steady state as a function of increasing coupling",
    ". then we decrease the coupling along the same phase space path , but now our initial condition for each value of the coupling is the stationary state obtained in the simulation with the previous value of @xmath166 .",

    "[ vsdif2 ] we observe precisely this behavior for the family of functions @xmath165 when increasing ( black circles ) and decreasing ( white circles ) the coupling for a fixed value of the intensity of the disorder , @xmath222 .",

    "the qualitative behavior is thus exactly as predicted by the mean field model .",
    "the coexistence of patterned and unpatterned states is discernible in the density plot insets of @xmath224 in the figure in that they are no longer cleanly annular but now include contributions from wavevectors other than those of magnitude near @xmath61 .",
    "the difference between the two insets ( indicating different relative contributions of patterned and unpatterned states ) is visible but , an even clearer rendition of the difference is seen in the angular average @xmath225 shown in the other two inset panels .",
    "note , for instance , that the contribution of modes near @xmath226 are relevant when increasing the coupling but very small when decreasing @xmath166 .",
    "using a modified mean field theory , we have explored general conditions under which spatially extended systems with coupling _ a la _ swift - hohenberg exhibit pattern formation _ purely _ induced by the presence of quenched dichotomous disorder .",
    "we have illustrated the phenomenology with a family of force functions that includes the paradigmatic models of noise - induced phase transitions and noise - induced spatial patterns , among them one that can fully be solved analytically within the mean field model .",
    "we show that pattern formation can be achieved through continuous ( second order ) and discontinuous ( first order ) transitions , and that the pattern formation phenomenon is re - entrant with the coupling .",
    "thus , increasing the coupling eventually destroys the order .",
    "all these predictions have been checked by means of numerical simulations , and we find full qualitative ( albeit not quantitative ) agreement with the theory .    beyond the capabilities of the modified mean field approach , we have explored not only the occurrence of patterns but also their coherence .",
    "the numerical simulations show that even while patterns become stronger ( as reflected by a larger value of the total power spectrum at the particular wavevector magnitude characteristic of the pattern ) , they may become less coherent ( as reflected by a larger contribution of neighboring wavevectors ) .",
