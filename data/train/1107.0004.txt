    "galaxy clusters are the largest self - gravitating systems in the universe , residing at the intersection of large - scale filamentary structures of the cosmic web . according to the hierarchical structure formation scenario based on a cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm , mass accretion flows onto clusters are still ongoing and high - mass ratio cluster mergers , the so - called major mergers , sometimes occur .",
    "major cluster mergers are among the most energetic events in the universe , releasing amounts of gravitational energy as large as @xmath2 . spatially resolved x - ray observation has revealed to us that this collision energy partly dissipates in the intracluster medium ( icm ) through shock heating and turbulence , yielding a complex icm brightness and thermal structure ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) .",
    "the dynamics of cluster collisions are however dominated by the cluster mass distribution , which can not be constrained from x - ray observations alone . due to the collisional nature of icm , cluster mergers",
    "are indeed expected to generate some transient decoupling between spatial distributions of the cdm and hot x - ray emitting gas .",
    "moreover , mass estimates relying on gas properties may be biased by merger - induced perturbations of the icm hydrostatic equilibrium ( h.e . ) within individual colliding clusters .",
    "weak - lensing distortions of background galaxy images provide us with a unique opportunity to reconstruct the distribution of matter in clusters without any assumption of mass model and dynamical states ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "conducted a systematic study of seven merging clusters , representing various merging stages and conditions , based on a joint weak - lensing , optical photometric , and x - ray analysis , and revealed that the mass and optical light of member galaxies are similarly distributed in merging clusters regardless of their merging stages , but the mass distribution in merging clusters is highly irregular , and is quite different from the icm distributions .",
    "it indicates that the gas and mass evolutions under cluster mergers are different .",

    "the data were reduced by the standard imaging process of using the reduction software for suprime - cam , sdfred @xcite , as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "astrometry calibration was conducted by fitting the final stacked image with the two micron all sky survey data catalog . the residual in astrometric fitting was lower than the ccd pixel size .",

    "our weak - lensing analysis is done using the imcat package provided by n. kaiser ( kaiser et al .",
    "we use the same pipeline as @xcite with some modifications followed by @xcite .",
    "we first measure the image ellipticity , @xmath14 , from the weighted quadrupole moments of the surface brightness of each object and then correct the point - spread function ( psf ) anisotropy by solving @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the smear polarizability tensor and the asterisk denotes the stellar objects .",
    "we fit the stellar anisotropy kernel @xmath17 with the second - order bi - polynomials function in several subimages whose sizes are determined based on the typical coherent scale of the measured psf anisotropy pattern . the median stellar ellipticities before and after the anisotropic correction are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "stellar ellipticities before and after the correction and their pattern are shown in figures [ fig : stell_e ] and [ fig : emap ] , respectively .",

    "then , we make a secure selection of background galaxies in a color - magnitude plane in order to minimize a dilution of the weak - lensing signals caused by a contamination of unlensed galaxies , mainly member galaxies . as shown in @xcite , the dilution effect on the lensing signals",
    "is more pronounced at smaller radii because the ratio of the number density of cluster galaxies to background ones rises towards the inner region .",
    "we use subaru / suprime - cam @xmath10 and cfht / mega - cam @xmath13 images .",
    "the difference in filter sensitivity functions of the wavelength in the @xmath13 band between these two instruments is negligible .",
    "therefore , a combination with subaru and cfht enables us to efficiently exclude member galaxies inthe background shear catalog .",
    "following @xcite , we calculate the lensing signal as a function of color ( figure [ fig : dilution ] ) , by averaging the tangential distortion strengths ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we securely select background galaxies in the range of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the best - fit linear function as a magnitude @xmath10 of red - sequence galaxies ; @xmath32 , as shown in figure [ fig : color - mag ] . here",
    ", the magnitudes and colors are measured by mag_auto ( i.e. , total magnitude ) and mag_aper ( i.e. , aperture magnitude ) in sextractor , respectively . by a selection in the color magnitude plane , the number density of background galaxies in the shear catalog decreases from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "the mean redshift of these background galaxies is estimated by matching the cosmos catalog @xcite to calculate the average lensing weight @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the angular diameter distances between the observer and source ( background galaxy ) and lens and source , respectively , and @xmath38 is a probability function of redshift distribution .",

    "in order to investigate the collision scenario in a2163 , we map out the cluster mass distribution and compare it with spatial distributions of the galaxy and hot gas components .",

    "we adopt the smoothing scale of @xmath42 due to the limitation of the number of background galaxies .",

    "this mass distribution clearly exhibit a bimodal morphology in the central region ( @xmath56 ) , with two peaks reaching significance levels of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "interestingly , these two peaks coincide with the two galaxy overdensities a1 and a2 hosting the two brightest cluster galaxies revealed in m08 , bcg1 , and bcg2 ( see also the top right and bottom left panels of figure [ fig : kappa+den ] ) .",
    "we hereafter refer to these primary and secondary mass peaks as mc and mw , respectively .",
    "the cluster mass distribution further exhibits some anisotropies at larger radii , mostly coinciding with peripheral optical clumps first revealed in m08 and presently confirmed ( see the bottom left panel of figure [ fig : kappa+den ] ) .",
    "the most significant of these coinciding mass and optical peaks is @xmath59 at the optical clump , b.    the mass distribution in the region of optical substructures c , d , and e , discovered by m08 , is similar to those of the number and luminous density , albeit low significance levels ( table [ tab : opticalclumps ] ) .",
    "we measure luminosities within @xmath60 centering each @xmath53 peak ( table [ tab : opticalclumps ] ) , where a background region of @xmath61 centering bcg1 is used .",
    "we find that luminosities and signal - to - noise ratios of @xmath53 are correlated .",
    "we tried to measure model - independent mass for each optical subclump , following @xcite . however , since the result is sensitive to the choice of background region , we could not obtain reliable results .",
    "an over - density region is further revealed from the density of galaxies whose colors are redder by @xmath62 at @xmath63 ( see the bottom right panel of figure [ fig : kappa+den ] ) .",
    "the width of colors for these galaxies is @xmath64 .",
    "distributed at the west of a2163 , these optical structures are associated with mass clumps of @xmath65 .",
    "more generally speaking , the cluster mass distribution appears as spatially correlated with density distribution of its member galaxies , consistently with weak - lensing studies in other clusters @xcite .",
    "we next compare the cluster mass contours with x - ray surface brightness and temperature maps derived from _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra data _ analysis in b11 .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : chan+kappa ] shows us a wavelet denoised map of the overall cluster atmosphere , with mass contours superimposed .",
    "these two distributions clearly exhibit a spatial segregation , the x - ray emission appearing as unimodal and e - w elongated , with an emission peak located between the two mass peaks .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : chan+kappa ] shows high - resolution details in a multi - resolution analysis of the _ chandra _ image . this analysis reveals a secondary cluster x - ray core , xw , separated from the main cluster emission peak , xc . as shown in b11",
    ", this wedge - shaped feature ( red - curved line in the right panel of figure [ fig : chan+kappa ] ) appears as a stripped cool core embedded in the hotter icm of a2163-a and delimited in the westward direction by a cold front .",
    "the evidence of this cold front let us infer the westward motion of this gas bullet along the elongated atmosphere of a2163-a .",
    "interestingly , we now observe that the crossing core appears as preceded by the secondary mass peak , from which it might have been spatially separated during a subcluster accretion onto the main cluster .",
    "this offset feature between the x - ray clump and mass peak is consistent with other cold front clusters on a merging phase @xcite .",
    "it suggests a possibility of ram pressure stripping of the accreted cluster core ( see also section [ sec : dis ] ) .",
    "it is further worth noticing that the main cluster mass peak , mc , also appears as slightly offset from the x - ray core , xc , so that the centroid of the gas core of xc and xw is at the intermediate position between the two mass peaks .",
    "this ` double offset ' separating the gas and dark matter contents of both the infalling and main cluster cores presents some similarities to the fast accretion observable in 1e0657 - 56 @xcite , the so - called `` bullet - cluster '' .",
    "to our knowledge , no other bimodal merger has been known so far to exhibit such a significant offset between the gas and dark matter components of its two components ( see , e.g. other examples in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the northern subcluster a2163-b exhibits a spatial coincidence between x - ray , mass , and member galaxies , consistent with what is usually observed in pre - merging systems @xcite .",
    "consistent with the lack of any interaction evidence found from icm thermodynamics between a2163-a and a2163-b , this spatial coincidence suggests that a2163-b is likely to be observed before interacting with a2163-a .",
    "we conduct a tangential distortion study , which is a one - dimensional lensing analysis , in order to measure the total cluster mass .",
    "the tangential distortion component of the reduced shear , @xmath66 , and the @xmath67 degree rotated component for individual galaxies ( @xmath45th galaxy ) are obtained by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the position angle in the counter clockwise direction from the first coordinate axis on the sky .",
    "then , the profiles of @xmath70 and @xmath71 are estimated with a statistical weight ( equation [ eq : ug ] ) , as follows : @xmath72 here , @xmath73 denotes the @xmath73th radial bin @xmath74 with a given bin .",
    "the statistical error of @xmath75 in each radial bin is estimated as @xmath76 where the prefactor @xmath77 comes from the fact that @xmath44 in the rms is the sum of two distortion components .",
    "we fit the tangential distortion profile with the universal profile proposed by navarro , et al .",
    "( 1996 , hereafter nfw profile ) and a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) halo model .",
    "the nfw halo mass is a prediction of numerical simulations based cdm model .",
    "the mass density profiles over a wide range of masses are well described in the form of @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the central density parameter and @xmath80 is the scale radius .",
    "the asymptotic inner and outer slopes for nfw mass density are @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "the three - dimensional mass profile within a radius , @xmath83 , at which the mean density is @xmath84 times the critical mass density , @xmath85 , at the cluster redshift , is expressed by @xmath86 with @xmath87 the nfw halo mass is described by two parameters of the mass @xmath88 and the halo concentration @xmath89 .",
    "the sis halo model is a solution of the collisionless boltzmann equation , and is specified by one parameter , the one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath90 , as follows , @xmath91 a three - dimensional mass for the sis model is given by @xmath92    the tangential distortion profile and the best - fit models are shown in figure [ fig : g+ ] .",
    "we choose the central position determined by two - dimensional shear analysis which will be described in detail in section [ sec:2d ] .",
    "we also measure the tangential shear profile with a center of bcg1 and fit them , but the results do not change significantly .",
    "we can clearly find a curvature of the tangential shear profile .",
    "the curvature makes it difficult to fit the profile with the sis model .",
    "the @xmath93 for the sis model is @xmath94 ; therefore , the sis model can be strongly rejected ( @xmath95 level ) as a mass model .",
    "on the other hand , the nfw mass model well expresses the curvature of the profile .",
    "indeed , @xmath96 for the nfw model is @xmath97 .",
    "the best - fit nfw parameters are found in table [ tab : mass ] .",
    "the virial mass shows the massive cluster , @xmath98 , where the virial overdensity is @xmath99 .",
    "our mass estimates are larger than those of a previous weak - lensing study ( table [ tab : mass ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , using the shear catalog without excluding a contamination of member galaxies .",
    "as shown in figures [ fig : opt+kappa ] and [ fig : kappa+den ] , the projected mass distribution of a2163 is complex and two mass peaks are significantly detected in the central region .",
    "it is of prime importance for understanding cluster merger phenomena to measure masses of the main- and sub- clusters .",
    "furthermore , since numerical simulations @xcite and observations @xcite have shown that a tangential shear profile is affected by significant substructures , taking into account substructures in modeling is also important for understanding such a lensing bias . in the mass measurement using the tangential shear profile ( section [ sec:1d ] ) , it is very difficult to distinguish which structure contributes in part to the tangential distortion signals , because the full lensing information from both the main and subclusters must be convolved to express the one dimensional distortion profile with respect to a given center @xcite .",
    "the two dimensional shear pattern , on the other hand , enables us to easily model lensing signals by a superposition of lensing signals . in this section ,",
    "we conduct two - dimensional shear fitting in order to measure the masses of three components ( the sub and main components for a2163-a and a2163-b ) revealed by m08 and b11 .",
    "we pixelize the shear pattern into a regular grid of @xmath100 without any spatial smoothing procedure , whereas we adopted gaussian smoothing in the map making ( section [ sec : map ] ) .",
    "the pixelized distortion signals and statistical weight , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , in the @xmath73th pixel are estimated with a weight function @xmath103 for each background source residing in the pixel ( see also equations .",

    ", @xmath108 is a kronecker delta function and @xmath109 is the statistical error of the pixelized shear @xcite .    we first consider a single mass model of the nfw profile in order to compare the mass estimates by tangential shear measurement .",
    "we here treat the center of nfw mass ( @xmath110 , @xmath111 ) as a parameter . in total",
    ", we use four parameters ( @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 ) for fitting .",

    "the resultant masses are consistent with the tangential shear measurements ( table [ tab : mass ] ) .",
    "the central position of mass is consistent with the peak position of the mc clump in the mass map .",
    "the mc clump , which is associated with bcg1 , is therefore likely to be the main component .",
    "we next add a mass model for the mass clump mw to the main cluster . from x - ray and optical spectroscopic studies",
    "( m08 and b11 ) , the mass clump mw is likely to be a merging substructure in a2163-a . since cluster substructure size is not determined by the virial theorem but by the strong tidal force of the main cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we adopt the truncated sis ( tsis ) model @xcite to describe the mw clump . the tsis model is an extreme case of the truncation ; mass density becomes zero at a radius @xmath116 .",
    "the tsis mass profile is expressed as @xmath117 the subclump mass for the tsis model is estimated as @xmath118 the tsis model is specified by one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath119 and the truncation radius @xmath116 .",
    "we have an additional four parameters ( @xmath119 , @xmath116 and centers ) for the tsis model and a total of eight parameters for the fitting .",
    "we assume that the redshift of the mw clump is the same as that of the main cluster .",
    "we adopt @xmath120 and @xmath121 , where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are peak coordinates appearing in a weak - lensing mass map .",
    "the resultant mass and central positions are shown in table [ tab : mass2 ] .",
    "the centroid of the mw clump is consistent with the peak found in the mass map .",
    "the truncation radius , @xmath124 , is an intermediate size compared to the virial radius of the main cluster @xmath125 . since the sub - cluster size after some impacts",
    "is significantly decreased by the strong tidal field , such a large truncation radius might suggest that the mw clump is a merging sub - cluster at the first impact .",
    "next , we take into account the northern component a2163-b ( m08 and b11 ) , which contains luminous galaxies ( optical clump b ) and an x - ray emitting core .",
    "we consider two possibilities for the dynamic state of a2163-b ; one scenario is the pre - merger phase that a2163-b is infalling toward a2163-a , and the other is that a2163-b has already undergone a merging event with the main cluster of a2163-a .",
    "b11 found no evidence of the close interaction between a2163-a and a2163-b , and therefore concluded that they are likely to be separated more than @xmath126 aligning along the line of sight .",
    "however , in m08 , a filament of faint galaxies was detected along a north / south axis between a2163-a and a2163-b which might suggest a previous interaction between the two components .",
    "although this post - merger hypothesis is very unlikely from the x - ray approach , the origin of this faint galaxy filamentary structure is still an open issue . in this paper , we investigate two possibilities in the fitting . if a2163-b is physically separated from a2163-a , its mass profile is not likely to be affected by the strong tidal field of a2163-a and we therefore adopt the nfw model for the first scenario . here ,",
    "the halo concentration is ill constrained because the shear signals from a2163-b are smaller than those from a2163-a , and it is difficult in the environment of the massive cluster to find the curvature of the distortion profile , as shown in figure [ fig : g+ ] .",
    "we therefore assume the mass - concentration relation of @xmath127 @xcite . here",
    ", we assume a redshift of a2163-b , @xmath128 , is the same as that of a2163-a .",
    "this assumption is justified by both the dynamical analysis ( m08 ) and the photometric redshift estimates by @xcite .",
    "we also parameterize the center of a2163-b , using 13 parameters in total .",
    "the resultant virial mass is @xmath129 ( table [ tab : mass2 ] ) .",
    "the mass @xmath130 within a radius @xmath126 , at which the mean density is @xmath131 times the critical density , agrees well with x - ray estimates @xmath132 ( b11 ) .",

    "they all are consistent within errors .",
    "we also found that the mc and mw masses are almost unchanged after adding the mass model of a2163-b .",
    "the resultant mass ratios of mc ( main cluster of a2163-a ) , mw ( sub cluster of a2163-a ) and a2163-b are found to be @xmath136 .",
    "we consider the second scenario that a2163-b is an ongoing merger with a2163-a .",
    "we here use the tsis model for a2163-b , following the case of the substructure mw .",
    "the truncation radius @xmath137 is obtained , while the concentration of the nfw mass model is not well constrained .",
    "this is because the tangential distortion profile for the truncation model outside the truncation radius is proportional to the inverse square of the radius ( @xmath138 ) , which is different from that of the nfw mass model for the main cluster .",
    "we obtain the substructure mas @xmath139 .",
    "the mass discrepancy between the two models is small : @xmath140 and @xmath141 with uncertainties of nfw and tsis masses , respectively .",
    "the two mass models ( nfw and tsis ) obtained solely by shear data are , therefore , acceptable for a2163-b .",
    "the total mass in each model is consistent within errors with tangential shear measurement , which indicates that a substructure effect is likely to be less significant .",
    "due to its exceptionally high mass and dynamical activity , a2163 has long been an interesting test case for cluster mass measurements .",
    "we here compare the weak lensing cluster mass , @xmath142 ( see section [ sec:1d ] and figure  [ fig : mhe_vs_mwl ] ) , with dynamical and x - ray mass estimates provided by m08 and b11 .",
    "as previously mentioned , weak lensing mass measurements do not require any assumption of cluster dynamical state .",
    "they consequently provide us a unique opportunity to investigate effects of the virial theorem hypothesis for member galaxies or the gas h.e .",

    "these assumptions would yield a cluster and subcluster temperature prior to the accretion of @xmath208 and @xmath209 , respectively , where the first , second and third errors are from mass measurement error , normalization error of scaling relation , and intrinsic scatter in the relation .",
    "assuming the main and subcluster emissivities to be comparable from a rough analysis of the x - ray image and weighting these temperatures following a scheme proposed in @xcite , an average icm temperature measured in the direction of the cool core would reach a value of @xmath210 . despite being consistent with uncertainties in our mass estimates ,",
    "this value is considerably lower than projected temperatures measured in the cool gas core xw in the _ xmm - newton _ temperature map and the _ chandra _ temperature profile of b11 ( @xmath211 ) . among the possible origin for this discrepancy",
    ", the cool gas core might have been heated from its virial temperature while crossing the main cluster atmosphere , possibly due to mixing with the main cluster atmosphere or a reverse shock , presumably at an earlier stage of its accretion and prior to the formation of the cold front .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    in summary , the density of the main cluster atmosphere and the velocity of its presumably free - falling subcluster are large enough to have separated the subcluster gas and dark matter components through ram - pressure stripping .",
    "moreover , the survival of the subcluster gas core against tidal forces exerted by the main cluster implies the subcluster accretion to have occurred with a non - zero impact parameter . comparing the average x - ray temperature in the direction of the cool core to its expectation from projection of the cluster and subcluster virial temperatures yields however a mild inconsistency , suggesting the cool core was partially heated while crossing the main cluster atmosphere .",
    "deeper x - ray observations should help better constrain the shape , temperature and mass of the cool core and refine this accretion scenario .",

    "the offset was reported in all cold - front clusters previously conducted by weak - lensing analysis @xcite .",

    "we show that the density of the main cluster atmosphere and the free fall velocity of an incoming subcluster with which mass is about one - eighth of main cluster virial mass are large enough to have separated the dark matter and gas component of this subcluster through ram - pressure stripping . following this scenario ,",
    "the survival of the cool core against tidal forces exerted by the main cluster lets us infer that the subcluster must have been accreted with a non - zero impact parameter , reaching typical values of @xmath213 . assuming the cool gas core and the secondary mass peak represent the separated components of the formerly accreted subcluster , the projected core temperature appears higher than expected from our estimates of the main and subcluster virial temperatures .",
    "subsequent to its separation with dark matter , the crossing cool core may thus have been shock heated or disturbed by hydrodynamical instabilities yielding a partial mixing with the main cluster atmosphere . *",
    "dominated by the most massive component of a2163-a , the overall mass distribution in a2163 is well described by a universal nfw profile as shown by a tangential distortion analysis , while the sis profile is strongly rejected ( @xmath95 confidence level ) .",

    "<S> we present a weak - lensing analysis of the merging cluster a2163 using subaru / suprime - cam and cfht / mega - cam data and discuss the dynamics of this cluster merger , based on complementary weak - lensing , x - ray , and optical spectroscopic data sets . from two - dimensional multi - component weak - lensing analysis , we reveal that the cluster mass distribution is well described by three main components including a two component main cluster a2163-a with mass ratio 1:8 , and its cluster satellite a2163-b . </S>",
    "<S> the bimodal mass distribution in a2163-a is similar to the galaxy density distribution , but appears as spatially segregated from the brightest x - ray emitting gas region . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the possible origins of this gas - dark matter offset , and suggest the gas core of the a2163-a subcluster has been stripped away by ram pressure from its dark matter component . </S>",
    "<S> the survival of this gas core to the tidal forces exerted by the main cluster lets us infer a subcluster accretion with a non - zero impact parameter . </S>",
    "<S> dominated by the most massive component of a2163-a , the mass distribution of a2163 is well described by a universal navarro - frenk - white profile as shown by a one - dimensional tangential shear analysis , while the singular - isothermal sphere profile is strongly ruled out . comparing this cluster mass profile with profiles derived assuming intracluster medium hydrostatic equilibrium ( h.e . ) in two opposite regions of the cluster atmosphere has allowed us to confirm the prediction of a departure from h.e . in the eastern cluster side , presumably due to shock heating . </S>",
    "<S> yielding a cluster mass estimate of @xmath0 , our mass profile confirms the exceptionally high mass of a2163 , consistent with previous analyses relying on the cluster dynamical analysis and @xmath1 mass proxy . </S>"
