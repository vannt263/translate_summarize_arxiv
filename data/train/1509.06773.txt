    "the surfaces of mid - sized saturnian satellites are a kind of laboratory where it is possible to observe and investigate the physical and dynamic processes that have been taking place around saturn and also throughout the solar system .",
    "the study of impact craters on the satellite surfaces allows us to better understand what could be happening in the saturn environment to produce these craters .",
    "the saturnian satellite system was observed and studied in the past by pioneer 11 and voyager 1 and 2 spacecrafts , greatly increasing the knowledge of the saturn system .",
    "voyager images revealed diverse satellite surfaces ( smith et al . , 1981 , 1982 ) .",
    "crater counts on those images indicated that saturnian satellites have been variably cratered , which suggest different geologic histories ( plescia and boyce 1982 , 1983 , 1985 ) . at present , the cassini - huygens mission is visiting the saturn system , and the detailed observations it renders provide us with new paradigms and physical processes to understand and interpret .",
    "the mid - sized icy satellites of saturn are mimas , enceladus , tethys , dione , rhea , and iapetus .",
    "they are regular satellites , mainly composed of water ice and in synchronous rotation .",
    "the cassini - huygens mission has observed all of them in detail allowing scientists to obtain accurate information on the shapes , mean radii and densities ( thomas , 2010 ) and gravity fields ( jacobson et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "furthermore , some of these satellites show traces of physical activity and renovation , possibly due to recent geological processes",
    ". the geologic activity could include endogenous activity such as viscous relaxation , volcanism , and/or tectonic or even atmospheric processes .",
    "cratering itself is a potential process in which the formation of large craters could remove small craters by ejecta emplacement and seismic shaking .",
    "also , exogenous processes , such as in fall from the e - ring or debris rings , could erase surface features .",
    "those physical processes would renew the satellite surfaces , erasing old or young surface features such as craters .",
    "the most striking case is enceladus whose surface differs markedly from region to region and has present active geysers emanating from four parallel fractures in the south polar region , called `` tiger stripes '' ( porco et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "this region is a very active one where the surface is modified , erasing the craters ( totally or partially ) .",
    "on dione , in turn , cassini observations reveal two different surfaces : the cratered plains ( cp ) , heavily cratered , and the smoother plains ( sp ) , with a lower cratering suggesting a younger surface . on rhea ,",
    "measurements by cassini spacecraft detected a tenuous atmosphere of oxygen and carbon dioxide ( teolis et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "iapetus is the opposite case of enceladus as it has heavily cratered plains with large degraded basins , which indicates that its surface is ancient .",
    "what is more , the count of small craters showed a size distribution indicative of crater saturation ( denk et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "kirchoff and schenk ( 2009 ) and ( 2010 ) , hereafter ks09 and ks10 , analyzed high - resolution cassini images and obtained the number and size - frequency distribution ( sfd ) of craters for the mid - sized icy satellites . with their observed number of craters and the previous cratering rate estimations by zahnle et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , they calculated the surface ages of each satellite for some crater diameters .",
    "there are a number of factors that must be taken into account in the analysis of the age of a satellite area .",
    "first , all possible impactor populations should be considered .",
    "the analysis of the images obtained by voyager ( smith et al . , 1981 , 1982 ) implied that the satellites were struck by two different impactor populations : population i , which produced a greater number of large craters ( bigger than 20 km ) , and population ii , which produced a greater number of smaller craters ( smaller than 20 km ) ( smith et al . , 1982 ) .",
    "the origin or even the existence of both populations is disputed .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 1981 , 1982 ) suggested that population i was the tail - off of a postaccretional heavy bombardment , while population ii has the form expected for collisional debris from the satellites or other orbiting debris .",
    "horedt and neukum ( 1984 ) concluded that cratering on saturnian satellites is produced by heliocentric objects as well as by planetocentric impactors .",
    "on the other hand , hartman ( 1984 ) noted that crater densities on heavily cratered surfaces throughout the solar system are all similar due to a `` saturation equilibrium '' .",
    "he argued that only one single population of heliocentric planetesimals and their fragments had been recorded .",
    "dobrovolskis and lissauer ( 2004 ) studied the fate of ejecta from the irregularly shaped satellite , hyperion , suggesting that it does contribute to population ii craters on the inner satellites of saturn .",
    "however , those particles would produce craters with a different morphology than those produced by a heliocentric source .    moreover , consideration of the primordial situation is important for the study of the origin of craters .",
    "it is believed that the mass of the primordial trans - neptunian zone , the source of centaurs , was @xmath1 times higher than the present one ( morbidelli et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "this mass might have been depleted by a strong dynamical excitation of the trans - neptunian region .",
    "there were several models that described the mass depletion ; for example , in the `` nice model '' and its subsequent versions , the interaction between the migrating planets and planetesimals destabilized the planetesimal disk and scattered the planetesimals all over the solar system before the time of the lhb ( tsiganis et al .",
    ", 2005 ; levison et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "accordingly , there was much primordial mass that struck the planets and their satellites very early in the solar system history .",
    "it would be expected that this event marked the surfaces of the satellites , mainly producing a great number of larger larger craters than at present .",
    "those craters are probably the larger ones that can be observed on the satellites",
    ". moreover , there are papers ( nervorny et al . , 2003 , 2007 ) that argue in favor of more primordial irregular satellites and a more active primordial collisional activity around the major planets .",
    "there would even be populations of large irregular satellites and debris of catastrophically disrupted satellites that may have played important roles in the history of the saturn system ( dones et al . , 2007 ) .    a primordial crater contribution to the saturn system",
    "could also be connected with the crater saturation observed on some of the saturnian satellites .",
    "the formation of craters , especially the larger ones , is a process that is effective in erasing small craters , not only through crater formation , but also by the ejecta blanket and seismic shaking .",
    "when a surface is so heavily bombarded that the formation of craters is equaled by the obliteration of craters , it reaches a crater saturation equilibrium . in this case , the density of craters on a surface does not change proportionally .",
    "this process is then critical to the determination of the source of impactors , geological processes , ages , etc ( hartmann and gaskell , 1997 ) .",
    "crater saturation equilibrium finally causes a distinctive cumulative size frequency distribution ( sfd ) of craters .",
    "gault ( 1970 ) obtained a @xmath2 power - law , from a model based on first principles and laboratory experiments .",
    "hartmann ( 1984 ) fitted a @xmath3 power - law for the cumulative sfd to crater count data of the surface of various solar system objects .",
    "richardson ( 2009 ) developed a detailed cratered terrain evolution model and observed the way in which crater densities attain equilibrium conditions .",
    "he found that if the impactor population has a cumulative power - law slope of @xmath4 , crater densities reach a cumulative power - law of about @xmath2 ; and if the impactor population has a cumulative power - law slope of @xmath5 , crater density equilibrium values follow the shape of the production population .",
    "squyres et al .",
    "( 1997 ) argued that cratering on a surface is a random process and as crater obliteration becomes more important , the spatial distribution of craters tends to be uniform .",
    "they used both the spatial distribution and size - frequency distribution of craters to study , with statistical techniques , how a cratered surface approaches saturation .",
    "they found that at least @xmath6 of the craters on rhea and callisto were destroyed by subsequent obliteration .",
    "therefore , crater saturation is especially important on highly cratered surfaces that are in general old .    in the supposedly young surfaces , as in the case of enceladus for example",
    ", geological processes are erasing craters .",
    "however , such processes compete with possible exogenous processes , like particle deposition on the surface that can fill in the craters , finally removing them .",
    "mid - sized saturnian satellites with the exception of iapetus are embedded in the saturn e - ring ; therefore their particles cross the orbits of the satellites with some probability of impact .",
    "enceladus s plumes are thought to be the source and maintenance of e - ring material ( hamilton and burns , 1994 , kempf et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "a fraction of the plume particles escape to populate the e - ring but other fraction returns to enceladus hitting its surface ( kempf et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "ingersoll and ewald , ( 2011 ) estimated @xmath7 kg for the mass of particles in the e - ring and a particle lifetime in the e - ring of about 8 years .",
    "this material could be an exogenous source causing erasure of craters in the mid - sized saturnian satellites .",
    "in a recent paper , di sisto and zanardi ( 2013 ) , hereafter dz13 , calculated the production of craters on the mid - sized saturnian satellites produced by current centaur objects coming from the scattered disk ( sd ) and plutinos , in the trans - neptunian region , and compared these calculations with the cassini observations made by ks09 and ks10 .",
    "also obtained was the current cratering rate on each satellite . in that paper",
    ", the authors concluded that since the number of observed small craters is lower than their calculated theoretical number , and because there are physical processes on at least some satellite surfaces that erode them , such difference is likely to be caused by those processes .",
    "it seems that the satellite surfaces were `` reset '' by those physical processes and were , therefore , younger and defined by the current geological processes .",
    "however , as mentioned , a number of factors has to be considered to test what processes are really taking place on the satellites and how these affect the age of their surfaces .",
    "therefore , in this paper we analyze in detail our theoretical predictions about the current cratering production to obtain satellite surface ages .",
    "these age determinations are not only a first approximation but also a way to help determine the time scale of the dynamic and geological processes that are taking place on the mid - sized satellites of saturn .",
    "since each satellite is a unique world , it is also interesting to test peculiarities and different processes on each satellite in our study .",
    "for the calculation of the number of impact craters and ages on the mid - sized saturnian satellites all potential populations of impactors should be considered .",
    "those impactors could be main - belt asteroids , jupiter and neptune trojans , jupiter family comets ( jfcs ) and centaurs from the sd , irregular satellites , planetocentric bodies and nearly isotropic comets ( nics ) ( dones et al .",
    "there is evidence , such as recent collisions and passages of comets by jupiter and the observations of saturn - crossing comets and centaurs ( dones et al . , 2009 ) as well as also previous work by zahnle et al . 1998 and 2003 , that centaurs and jfcs dominate impact cratering in the outer solar system .",
    "the only truly unknown potential impactor population is the planetocentric one .",
    "this hypothetical source has been discussed by previous papers ( see sect .",
    "1 ) but it has not been observed so far ; its possible contribution or existence will be analyzed for each satellite with our results .",
    "di sisto and zanardi ( 2013 ) calculated the production of craters on the mid - sized saturnian satellites by centaur objects from sd and plutinos .",
    "they found that the contribution of plutinos is negligible with respect to scattered disk objects ( sdos ) .",
    "they used a method previously developed by di sisto and brunini ( 2011 ) , hereafter db11 .",
    "both papers are based on the numerical simulation carried out by di sisto and brunini ( 2007 ) , who studied the evolution of sdos for 4.5 gyrs when they enter the centaur zone , considering the current configuration of the solar system .",
    "di sisto and brunini ( 2007 ) studied only centaur objects when they enter the giant planet zone from the sd ; they stopped their simulation when centaurs enter the jfcs zone .",
    "thus , the contribution of jfcs to the satellite cratering is not considered here .",
    "however , only a @xmath8 of sdos enter the jfc zone ( di sisto and brunini , 2007 ) .",
    "these objects were studied by di sisto et al .",
    "( 2009 ) through a numerical simulation that included a complete dynamical - physical model .",
    "only a fraction of the initial comets return to the centaur zone , depending on the size of the comet ( a jfc reduces its radius due to sublimation and splitting ) .",
    "we can then assume that this contribution should be approximately one order of magnitude smaller than that of the centaurs when they enter the saturn zone from the sd .",
    "dz13 and db11 used the output files of the encounters of sdos with saturn when they enter the centaur zone ( from di sisto and brunini , 2007 ) to calculate the cumulative number of craters ( @xmath9 ) produced by current centaurs on the saturnian satellites .",
    "it is generally accepted that the mass of the primordial trans - neptunian zone , the source of centaurs , was @xmath1 times higher than the present one ( morbidelli et al . 2008 ) and decreased to its present value in at most 1 gyr ( `` nice model '' ) .",
    "this early phase of the solar system was not modeled in the numerical simulation by di sisto and brunini ( 2007 ) , which instead started after the initial mass depletion , when the solar system began to stabilize , and essentially becomes like the current configuration of the solar system .",
    "as mentioned , this simulation was run for 4.5 gyrs , since the exact duration of this early phase is not known ; but it should be representative of the post initial mass depletion time , namely @xmath10 gyr",
    ". then , @xmath11 corresponds to the number of craters produced since the change in configuration of the solar system predicted by the nice model ( @xmath12 ga ) .    in dz13 , we calculated the @xmath9 for each satellite and for two cases of the sfd of sdos .",
    "that is , we considered a sfd of sdos as a power law with a differential index @xmath13 for diameters @xmath14 km ( from elliot et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "the sfd breaks for @xmath15 km , but given the uncertainty in the sfd for small objects , we considered two values of the differential index : @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( the dohnanyi exponent ) . in dz13 , we also compared our theoretical number of craters with the number of observed craters obtained by ks09 in figs . 2 - 7 of their paper .",
    "we noticed that our calculated number of craters for @xmath17 is in general closer to the observed number by ks09 .",
    "however , for small craters , the observed number of craters is lower than the calculated one .",
    "since in general there would be physical processes on mid - sized saturnian satellite surfaces that erode them , these processes could erase small craters .",
    "the extent of this erasure is specific to each satellite because it depends on the process that is taking place on each one .",
    "it is possible , then , to account for this process by calculating the age of each satellite surface .",
    "the calculation of the age of each terrain is as follows : first , let us assume ( on the basis of previous comments)that the centaurs from the sd are the main source of craters in the current configuration of the solar system and that , given the similarity with observations mentioned before , the calculated number of craters is the one obtained from the differential index : @xmath17 of the sfd of small sdos .",
    "this assumption can be considered a first step in the determination of ages .",
    "since centaurs come mainly from the sd ( di sisto and brunini , 2007 ) , they should be the most important current heliocentric source of craters .",
    "it should be highlighted that a possible planetocentric source of craters has been excluded since there are no estimations or calculations from this hypothetical source .    from dz13 , we know the total number of craters on each satellite greater than a given diameter d , produced by centaurs from the sd in the current configuration of the solar system ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we took the observed number of craters @xmath18 from ks09 .",
    "then , if @xmath19 , we can state that the terrain has preserved craters that were produced at earlier times of the solar system , or that there have been other important sources of craters ( such as a planetocentric source ) , and/or there is no current geological activity that could erode the craters .",
    "but if @xmath20 , there are @xmath21 craters that have been erased and then there must be a geological process taking place on the satellite surface",
    ". the comparison between the calculated and the observed numbers can be seen in figs .",
    "2 - 7 in dz13 , where it is noticeable that there is a range of crater diameters ( different for each satellite ) for which @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , those terrains could have a geological activity that has eroded the craters , and the surface would be young .    to calculate the age of those surfaces , the temporal dependence of cratering was used . according to the method developed by db11 ,",
    "the cumulative number of craters produced by centaurs is proportional to the number of encounters of centaurs with saturn .",
    "then , the temporal dependence of cratering is equal to that of encounters with saturn ( see eqs .",
    "2 - 7 in db11 ) . in fig .",
    "[ enc ] of this paper , the fraction of encounters with saturn ( number of encounters for a given time with respect to the total number of encounters ) was plotted as a function of time and found that the whole plot could be fitted by a log - function given by :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "then , the cumulative number of craters on a given satellite depending on time can be obtained from :    @xmath25    differentiating this equation with respect to time , we obtain the cratering rate over time from :    @xmath26    zanhle et al .",
    "( 1998 ) calculated cratering rates on the galilean satellites considering the contribution of several heliocentric sources .",
    "they also calculated the age of the satellite surfaces .",
    "to such end , they considered that the cratering rate on each satellite decreases with time as @xmath27 from a numerical simulation developed by holman and wisdom ( 1993 ) who found that a collisionless kuiper belt dissipates as @xmath27 .",
    "this is the same behavior of our calculated cratering rate of eq .",
    "[ ct ] , since the original simulation by di sisto and brunini ( 2007 ) deals with the dynamical evolution of tnos .",
    "then , we follow a development analogous to zanhle et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to find the age of a satellite surface but now considering eq .",
    "( [ ct ] ) for the cratering rate .",
    "thus , the estimated cratering timescale or the `` age '' of the surface @xmath28 would be given by :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 gyrs is the age of the solar system .",
    "@xmath28 represents the model age of the surface for a given diameter , because it is a measure of the cratering timescale , taking into account the production of craters and the erosion of the terrain .    in the following sections , we show our results for the mid - sized saturnian satellites",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , considering that centaurs are the current main source of craters , if @xmath20 , there are @xmath21 craters that could have been erased . this difference can be plotted against @xmath31 to get an understanding of the magnitude of the process on each satellite . in fig . [ ncno ] , we plot @xmath21 versus @xmath31 for mimas , tethys , dione and rhea considering @xmath32 from ks09 .",
    "for all those satellites , the smaller @xmath31 is , the greater the difference between observation and our model",
    ". notice also the different slopes of the curves .",
    "tethys and mimas have more flattened curves meanwhile the curves for dione and rhea are steeper .",
    "therefore , for tethys and mimas , there seems to be a process that is acting for a wider range of diameters than for rhea and dione .",
    "we calculate the age depending on d from eq .",
    "[ age ] and plot the results for mimas , tethys , dione and rhea in fig .",
    "[ todos ] .",
    "these age - curves correspond to the terrains analyzed by ks09 . in all the curves",
    ", there seems to be a noticeable correlation between older age and diameter ; that is , smaller craters are younger than greater ones .",
    "as can be seen , only small craters would be young or , at least , younger than 4.5 gyrs old .",
    "this means that there could be a geological or other physical process that gradually erases craters and modifies the satellite surface ; naturally , smaller craters are cleared before greater ones .",
    "furthermore , the slopes of the age curves are different for each satellite",
    ". this fact could imply either that each satellite presents different geological processes or exogenous erasing agents ( like deposition of e - ring particles ) , or at least , that each process has a different temporal scale .",
    "it could also be possible that on a given satellite surface the equilibrium crater saturation had been reached .",
    "there also exists a correlation between the size range or erased craters and distance to saturn . in the ranges of the diameters plotted , mimas , the innermost mid - sized satellite located in the inner edge of the e - ring , has a wider range of diameters of erased craters than tethys , which is farther away from saturn .",
    "then follows dione in distance to saturn , and finally rhea , at the end of the e - ring .",
    "this correlation is very interesting , and potentially implies that one can associate a modification surface agent that depends on the distance to the planet .        using eq .",
    "[ age ] , there is a certain diameter @xmath31 from which @xmath33 gets greater than @xmath11 and then @xmath34 approaches 0 .",
    "therefore , the calculated ages trend asymptotically to the age of the solar system and for those diameters , the surface would be old . as mentioned in the previous section , when @xmath35 , there are more craters on the surface of the satellite than our calculated number .",
    "since @xmath11 represents the crater contribution from centaurs in the current configuration of the solar system , there are craters that were produced earlier in the solar system history and/or there is another source of craters , such as planetocentric objects .",
    "the limit diameters beyond which @xmath36 ( or before which @xmath20 ) are presented in table [ dlim ] ; it can be seen that those limit diameters are different for each satellite and might be associated with different kinds of processes .",
    "therefore , we can not evaluate other crater sources for all satellites in general , but we can analyze all our results for each satellite in separate subsections .",
    ".limit diameter beyond which @xmath36 ) [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     according to our results , all surfaces analyzed up to now appear be old .",
    "however , we have noticed that for small sizes the observed number of craters is smaller than the calculated number from our model .",
    "the size limit of each satellite is presented in table [ dlim ] .",
    "although this size limit is different for each satellite , a common explanation for this paucity of small craters could be crater saturation .",
    "in particular , crater saturation starts in small sizes and would gradually incorporate larger crater sizes .",
    "enceladus is a very interesting and beautiful moon of saturn .",
    "it has a diameter of @xmath37 km and a density of @xmath38gr@xmath39@xmath40 ( thomas , 2010 ) .",
    "cassini - huygens images reveal a very active surface with unique features , which invites one to investigate them .",
    "the discovery of the plumes of water vapor and small icy particles in the south polar region by cassini huygens in 2005 ( porco et al . , 2006 ) showed us a very active world and at the same time , it was very important for the study of icy satellites .",
    "high resolution images of the south polar terrains from cassini reveal tectonic features , a region almost entirely free of impact craters but with several @xmath41-km - long fractures called `` tiger stripes '' , probably warmed by internal tidally generated heat ( porco et al . ,",
    "it was also found that this south polar region is 20 k hotter than expected from models , and a thermal emission of 3 to 7 gw was detected ( spencer et al .",
    "gravity field studies by iess et al .",
    "( 2014 ) demonstrated that the structure of enceladus is compatible with a differentiated body with , for example , a relatively low core density of @xmath42 and an @xmath43 mantle of density of @xmath44 and thickness of 60 km .",
    "however , the local south polar heat fluxes , gravity and topography , is more consistent with a regional sub sea of @xmath45 km thick in the south pole located beneath an ice crust @xmath46 km thick ( iess et al . , 2014 ) .",
    "the surface of enceladus is covered in almost pure water ice ( brown et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "newman et al .",
    "( 2008 ) mapped the distribution of crystalline and amorphous ices on the surface of enceladus from photometric and spectral analysis of data from cassini visual and infrared mapping spectrometer .",
    "they found a mostly crystalline ice surface with a higher degree of crystallinity in the `` tiger - stripe''cracks , and amorphous ice between these stripes . ``",
    "ice blocks '' were also observed on enceladus surface , like the regolites in asteroids and airless bodies of the solar system ( porco et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "however , their origin seems to be different .",
    "martens et al .",
    "( 2015 ) analyzed their distribution and origin in detail and found that , although they are found in other regions , they are more concentrated within the south polar terrain , where they must be produced mainly by tectonic deformation .",
    "all this suggests a very active and evolving surface .",
    "moreover , enceladus displays different types of terrain : in particular , as one moves away from the `` tiger stripes '' , more craters are found ( ks09 ) .",
    "this is due to the continuous resurfacing in the south polar zone .",
    "in fact , porco et al .",
    "( 2006 ) estimated ages within the south polar terrain possibly as young as 500000 years , or even younger .",
    "as in the previous section , we estimate the age of enceladus surface comparing our calculations of the cratering production with the observed crater counts .",
    "there are crater counts on enceladus from cassini by ks09 , but also previous counts from voyager by plescia and boyce ( 1983 ) and smith et al .",
    "images from voyager spacecrafts 1 and 2 showed a wide diversity of terrains on the surface of enceladus .",
    "different areas have been identified , according to the populations of craters and other landforms ( fig .",
    "21 of smith et al . , 1982 ) . among these ,",
    "the cratered terrains ( ct1 ) and well preserved terrains ( ct2 ) are distinguished .",
    "another kind of terrain are the cratered plains ( cp ) , whose principal landforms are bowl - shaped craters . in the equatorial region voyager",
    "observed smooth plains sp1 and sp2 .",
    "the grooves are the principal landforms in sp1 , which have few craters of 2 km to 5 km in diameter , while sp2 and ridged plains ( rp ) are almost free of craters .",
    "the number of observed craters in voyager images were taken from fig . 1 and table 1 in plescia and boyce ( 1983 ) for ct1 and ct2 ( ect ) and cp ( ecp ) , and from fig . 23 in smith et al .",
    "( 1982 ) for sp1 , sp2 and rp .",
    "kirchoff and schenk ( 2009 ) analyzed cassini images for crater counts .",
    "they analyzed different types of terrain separately according to variations in crater density and geological features ( see their fig .",
    "4 ) . those regions are cratered plains ( cp - eq and cp - mid ) and the ridged regions rp1 , rp2 , rp3 , rp4 , rp5 , and rp6 .",
    "the regions analyzed by voyager and cassini seem to be different . however , through an inspection of cartographic base maps of enceladus in both papers ( smith et al . , 1982 and ks09 )",
    ", it seems that rp and sp2 and probably sp1 regions of voyager are near the ridged plains ( rp1-rp6 ) of ks09 ; ct1 and ct2 regions of voyager are near mid - latitude cratered plains of ks09 , and cp regions of voyager are near equatorial cratered plains of ks09 .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that the cassini data have a higher spatial resolution than that from voyager .",
    "the cassini mission has been able to show craters with @xmath47 km .",
    "also , ks09 has made a subdivision of ridged plains ( rp ) , resulting in better details .    from our model developed in dz13 ,",

    "those numbers are shown in fig .",
    "[ nenc ] .",
    "in general , the observed curves are below the calculated curve in our model . therefore , the observed number of craters on the studied terrains would be lower than the current expected contribution of centaurs with the exception of ecp and ect , which present a greater number of observed craters than our model for @xmath48 km respectively .",

    "[ ageenccp ] and [ ageencrp ] for both observed crater counts ( voyager and cassini ) and regions .",
    "we have separated the results into two figures because of the wide age range .",
    "we can see that the observed areas of enceladus are usually young , and that age increases as we move away from the `` tiger stripe '' cracks .",
    "cratered plains in mid and high latitudes ( cp - mid ) are @xmath49 gyrs old , regions ct1 and ct2 of voyager are @xmath50 gyrs old , but craters less than @xmath51 km could be younger . on the contrary , cratered plains in equatorial latitudes ( cp - eq )",
    "are younger than 3 gyrs old for the crater sizes counted by ks09 .",
    "ecp from voyager seems to be old , but craters less than @xmath52 km could be younger .",
    "all rp regions appear to be very young .",
    "the rp1 region , which is very near the `` tiger stripes '' , a very active region , is the youngest region , and rp6 is the oldest one .",
    "however , all sizes of craters in rp6 are young .",
    "in fact , there are craters with @xmath53 km which are younger than @xmath54 gyrs old . in rp6",
    ", age increases with diameter like in the other mid - sized satellites .",
    "but in the rp1-rp5 zones , ages are similar for all the diameter ranges analyzed and they are all less than @xmath55 myrs old .",
    "the very young region rp1 is @xmath56 myrs old on average .",
    "those ages of the ridged plains would be in agreement with estimations by plescia and boyce ( 1985 ) who estimated an age of no more than 100 myrs .",
    "this behavior in the rp1-rp5 zones must be due to the plumes emanating from the south polar region and tectonic activity probably associated with `` tiger stripes '' , whose production mechanisms strongly erase those craters .    in comparison with previous research ,",
    "our ages are more similar to those calculated by ks09 for their case b ( see table 3 ) .",
    "moreover , enceladus plumes are thought to be the source and maintenance of e - ring material , but a fraction of the plume particles returns to enceladus hitting its surface ( kempf et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "the particle deposition on enceladus surface is more frequent in the `` tiger stripes '' than in other regions , as for example mid latitudes ( kempf et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "also , the largest water ice particles covering enceladus surface ( @xmath57 mm ) are concentrated in the `` tiger stripes '' zone and in general , the particle diameters are strongly correlated with the distance to this zone ( jaumann et al . , 2008 ) . therefore",
    ", the plume material returning to enceladus could be an `` exogenous '' source causing the erasure of craters preferentially near the tiger stripes .",
    "on the other hand , the heat emanating from the south polar terrain , detected by cassini s composite infrared spectrometer , suggests internal geological activity ( spencer et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "the heat source for the production of the plumes , resurfacing and heat flow in the south polar region of enceladus , has not yet been sufficiently understood .",
    "the estimated radiogenic and tidal heating resulting from the orbital eccentricity of enceladus are not sufficient to account for the energy emanating from the south polar zone ( porco et al . , 2006 ; meyer and wisdom , 2007 ) .",
    "besides , the absence of internal activity on mimas , which has an orbital eccentricity greater than enceladus , further constrain this as an unlikely source .",
    "porco et al .",
    "( 2006 ) analyzed other tidal heating mechanisms , such as mean motion resonances among the saturnian moons , the 2:1 mean motion resonance with dione being the most important , and secondary resonance heating , but those mechanisms are also inadequate .",
    "squyres et al .",
    "( 1983 ) suggested that the current rate of tidal heating might be sufficient to maintain a liquid sea under a crust of 10 km , but a previous stronger heating would be required to initiate the melting .",
    "this previous process might have been that enceladus had a larger eccentricity in the past ( to obtain a greater tidal heating ) or was captured into mean motion or secondary resonances with other satellites ( porco et al . , 2006 ; meyer and wisdom , 2008 ) .",
    "meyer and wisdom ( 2008 ) demonstrated that enceladus is probably near its equilibrium eccentricity and that the current equilibrium heating rate is not enough to trigger the melting .",
    "therefore , any previous stronger heating requires some non - equilibrium behavior .",
    "based on both calculations of the cratering rate and the number of craters produced by centaurs , and the comparison with observations , we have estimated the surface age of each observed terrain on each mid - sized satellite of saturn .",
    "the results are given for each satellite , but in general terms we can say that there are less observed small craters than calculated ( except on iapetus ) , which result in young ages calculated from our model .",
    "this could be interpreted as either efficient endogenous or exogenous process(es ) erasing small craters or crater saturation .",
    "we have also found that the smaller craters are being preferentially removed .",
    "this agrees with a gradual process of erosion , either from a geological or exogenous origin or by cratering itself . this erasing process does not affect large craters , and the size limit depends on the satellite . for craters greater than this size limit ,",
    "our results imply that there are primordial craters , and/or that another main source of craters might exist .",
    "we have also found a correlation between the limit size from which small craters are erased ( and then age is below 4.5 gyrs old ) and the distance to saturn .",
    "that is , the smaller the distance from saturn , the higher the size limit ( see table [ dlim ] ) .",
    "it is possible that there is not a general process to describe this behavior since each satellite has its own peculiarities .",
    "however , a potential common process that seems to explain the paucity of small craters is crater saturation which could be connected to the correlation between distances to saturn and erasure size limit .",
    "another possibility is that deposition of e - ring particles could be responsible for such a correlation . since the e - ring has a density that generally decreases from enceladus to rhea ( hornyi et al . , 2008 )",
    ", the e - ring flux on the mid - sized satellites could be lower as we move away from enceladus .",
    "the estimated ages for the terrains analyzed on the mid - sized satellites , with the exception of enceladus , are @xmath50 gyrs old .",
    "our ages are , within the ages calculated by ks09 , but the fact that smaller craters are preferentially removed seems to be strong in our calculations .",
    "almost all the enceladus terrains could be young , with the exception of the mid and high latitude plains .",
    "the regions near the south polar terrain could be as young as 50 myrs old .",
    "on the contrary , all the surface of iapetus is old and it likely records a primordial source of craters , smaller craters being likely approaching saturation until @xmath0 km - craters , where saturation is complete .",
    "the ages calculated here are based on the current number of centaur objects as contributors to craters .",
    "we have used the best known estimations from the literature for both this number and the size - frequency distribution . however , for small sizes , this sfd is uncertain and also unreachable with current direct observations .",
    "that is why the theoretical crater contribution , the comparison with observations and the determination of terrain ages in this paper should be carefully interpreted and not taken as absolute ages .",
    "they could serve , instead , to enhance both the understanding of the processes occurring on the satellites and the sfd for small sizes .",
    "finally , the comparison of our age estimations with geological time scales on saturnian satellites could help us determine what is still unknown today about those wonderful worlds .",
