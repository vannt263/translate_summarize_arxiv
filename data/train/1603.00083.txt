    "the production of nano- and microfibers has gained increasing interest due to the large number of promising applications , including filtration , textiles , medical , protective , structural , electrical , and optical materials and coatings .",
    "in particular , an intriguing feature of electrospun fibers is the high surface - area , which is due to the combination of small radius and extreme length of the fiber ( in principle up to km when polymer solutions with high degree of molecular entanglement are used to achieve stable electrified jets ) .",
    "this offers intriguing perspectives for practical applications . as a consequence ,",
    "several studies have been focused on the production and characterization of such structures .",
    "@xcite    following the pioneering works of rayleigh @xcite and , later , zeleny,@xcite the electrospinning process relies on a strong electric field ( typically @xmath0 ) in order to elongate and accelerate a polymeric fluid body from a nozzle towards a conductive collector . during the development of the jet path , the stream cross - section decreases by orders of magnitude , providing a jet , and consequently solid fibers , with transversal size potentially well below the micrometer - scale .",
    "the dynamic evolution of the polymer nanojet involves two different stages : in the first , the pendent polymeric droplet is stretched by the intense external electric field , providing a straight path . in the second",
    ", small perturbations induce bending instabilities , and a complex jet path is consequently observed . in a typical electrospinning experiment , hydrodynamic perturbations , as well as mechanical vibrations nearby the nozzle ,",
    "might misalign the jet axis .",
    "according to the earnshaw s theorem,@xcite an off - axis misalignment triggers an electrostatic - driven bending instability , leading the fluid into a region of spiral coils . as a consequence",
    ", the jet travels a larger distance between the nozzle and the collector , and the fiber diameter undergoes a further decrease along the way , leading to a reduction of the fiber diameter .",
    "several studies were focused on experimental parameters , such as applied electric voltage , liquid viscosity , etc .. @xcite similarly , the use of complementary external forces was also investigated .",
    "for instance , a gas stream provided by suitable distributers and surrounding the electrospinning nozzle can be used as additional stretching force , providing fibers with small diameter .",
    "@xcite this process is generally called gas - assisted electrospinning ( sometimes electroblowing ) .",
    "nonetheless , many of the effects of gas flows on electrospinning still need to be investigated in a systematic way , particularly with regard to the relationship between gas flow speed and bending instabilities .",
    "indeed , given the ubiquitous nature of intentional or stochastic gas flows in the process atmosphere , understanding in depth such points is very important for a correct design of electrospinning experiments , when fibers with very small diameters are to be produced with a given polymer solution .    in this framework",
    ", simulation models can be useful for understanding the key processing parameters and ultimately exerting a better control on the resulting fiber morphologies , better elucidating the phenomenology of electrified jets and providing valuable information for the development of new spinning experiments .",
    "for these reasons , various models have been proposed for electrospinning in the recent years,@xcite which can be categorized on based on the approach used for representing the jet . in the first class of models ,",
    "the filament is treated as obeying the equations of continuum mechanics,@xcite whereas in the second the jet is described as a series of discrete elements obeying the equations of newtonian mechanics,@xcite as it is the case of the present work .",
    "recently , lauricella et al .",
    "@xcite developed a one - dimensional model for studying the air drag effects on the early stage of electrospinning process . in this approach",
    ", the liquid jet was represented as a series of charged beads , connected by viscoelastic springs according to the original picture proposed by reneker and yarin.@xcite the jet dynamics was the result of the combined action of viscoelastic coulombic , external electrical forces , and a dissipative term which models the air drag effect .",
    "based on experimental observations,@xcite the dissipative air drag term was taken as non - lineary dependent on the jet geometry .",
    "as consequence , the model included a non - linear langevin - like stochastic differential equation describing the fluid motion .",
    "however , an investigation of the air drag effects on three - dimensional ( 3d ) bending instabilities was still missing .    here , we provide a 3d description of electrified jets which includes air drag , and study its effects in the dynamics of the bending instabilities .",
    "in particular , our aim is to investigate the relation between the dissipative - perturbing forces and the resulting deposition of electrospun fibers .",
    "furthermore , the extended model is used to set up an ideal experiment of gas - assisted electrospinning , which involves a gas - injecting system located at the collector and oriented towards the spinneret . in this context",
    ", we probe the effects of a controlled gas counterflow on the fiber diameter , which could be useful for designing new electrospinning experiments .    the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we present the 3d model for electrospinning , with the set of stochastic differential equations of motion ( eom ) which govern the dynamics of system .",
    "results are reported and discussed in sec .",
    "finally , conclusions are outlined in sec .",
    "in this paper , we modify the 3d model of electrospinning previously implemented in the software package jetspin , a specifically - developed , open - source and freely - available code.@xcite we use a lagrangian discrete model which represents the polymer solution filament as a series of @xmath1 beads ( jet beads ) at mutual distance @xmath2 , each pair of beads in the row being connected by viscoelastic elements , as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) .",
    "the length @xmath2 is taken to be larger than the radius of the filament .",
    "each @xmath3 bead has mass @xmath4 and charge @xmath5 , assumed equal for all the beads for simplicity .",
    "the spinneret is represented by a single mass - less point of charge @xmath6 fixed at @xmath7 , which we call nozzle bead .",
    "a typical simulation is started with a single jet bead inserted at the nozzle , and placed at distance @xmath8 from the nozzle along the @xmath9 axis .",
    "the onset of the jet takes place with a cross - sectional radius @xmath10 , defined as the radius of the polymer solution filament at the nozzle , before the stretching process occurs , leading to the elongation and cross - section reduction in the fluid body .",
    "furthermore , the starting jet bead has an initial velocity @xmath11 along the @xmath9 axis equal to the bulk fluid velocity in the needle of the extrusion syringe or reservoir . once this traveling bead reaches a distance @xmath12 away from the nozzle , a new particle ( third body )",
    "is placed at distance @xmath8 from the nozzle along the straight line joining the two previous bodies ( nozzle and previous jet bead ) .",
    "note that @xmath8 defines the length step used to discretize the liquid jet at the nozzle before the stretching process starts taking place .",
    "the procedure is then repeated , leading to a series of @xmath1 beads representing the jet .",
    "it is worth stressing that hereafter we indicate by @xmath13 the particle which is the closest to the collector .    the jet is therefore modelled as a body constituted by a viscoelastic maxwell fluid , and the stress @xmath14 on the @xmath3 dumbbell which connects the bead @xmath15 with the bead @xmath16 is given by the equation :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the length of the element , @xmath19 is the elastic modulus , @xmath20 the viscosity of the fluid jet , and @xmath21 the time ( see fig . [",
    "fig : model ] ) .",
    "the length @xmath22 is computed as the mutual distance between the @xmath3 bead and its previous bead .",
    "being @xmath23 the fiber radius at the bead @xmath15 , the viscoelastic force , @xmath24 , pulling the bead @xmath15 back to @xmath25 and towards @xmath16 , reads as follows :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the unit vector pointing from bead @xmath25 to bead @xmath15 .",
    "the force @xmath28 due to the surface tension for the @xmath3 bead is given by :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the surface tension coefficient , @xmath31 is the local curvature , and @xmath32 is the unit vector pointing the center of the local curvature from bead @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) .",
    "the force @xmath28 tends to restore the rectilinear shape acting on the bent part of the jet .    in electrospinning processes ,",
    "the jet stretch is mainly due to an external electric potential @xmath33 which is applied between the spinneret and the conducting collector .",
    "denoted by @xmath34 the distance of the collector from the injection point , each @xmath3 bead undergoes the electric force :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the unit vector pointing the collector from the spinneret ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) . note that whenever a jet bead touches the collector , its position is frozen and its charge is set to zero .",
    "the net coulomb force @xmath37 on the @xmath3 bead from all the other beads is given by :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the unit vector pointing the @xmath3 bead from the @xmath41 bead .",
    "the force due to the gravity is also considered in the model , and it is computed by the usual expression    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "these features are implemented in the jetspin software package.@xcite next , we extend the 3d framework in order to include the air drag terms , and reproduce aerodynamic effects . consequently , code modifications have been implemented in jetspin . in particular , we model the air drag by adding a random term and a dissipative term to the forces involved in the process .",
    "the dissipative air drag term is usually dependent on the geometry of the jet , which changes in time , and it combines longitudinal and lateral components . based on experimental findings,@xcite the longitudinal component of the air drag dissipative force term acting on a jet segment of length @xmath2 is given by the empirical formula :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 denotes the air density , @xmath46 the kinematic viscosity , @xmath47 the tangent unit vector , and @xmath48 represents the tangent component of the total velocity with respect to the air flow given as the difference between jet velocity @xmath49 and air flow velocity @xmath50 . the gas flow is assumed to be oriented along the @xmath9-axis with opposite direction , but the choice is not mandatory . following the approach introduced by lauricella et al .",
    "@xcite , we rearrange the last eq . as    @xmath51    rewriting eq .",
    "[ eq : fric - rewritten ] for the @xmath3 bead representing a jet segment , and assuming a constant volume of the jet @xmath52 , so that @xmath53 with @xmath8 and @xmath10 respectively the length and the radius of the jet segment between at the nozzle before the stretching , we obtain    @xmath54    where we have collected several terms of the empirical relationship in @xmath55 which is equal to @xmath56 in order to obtain the dissipation term of a non linear langevin - like equation ( for further details see lauricella et al .",
    "it is worth stressing that @xmath55 is derived by the empirical relationship of eq .",
    "[ eq : fric - emp ] , so that also eq .",
    "[ eq : fric - coef ] is a nondimensional combination of physical parameters .    in a 3d framework",
    "a lateral lift force should also be considered . following the expression introduced by yarin,@xcite under a high - speed air drag the lateral component @xmath57 of the aerodynamic dissipative force related to the flow speed",
    "is given in the linear approximation ( for small bending perturbations ) by : @xmath58 the combined action of such longitudinal and lateral components ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lift - drag - forces ] ) provide the dissipative force term acting on the @xmath3 bead    @xmath59    whereas , the random force term for the @xmath3 bead has the form    @xmath60    where @xmath61 denotes a generic diffusion coefficient in velocity space ( which is assumed constant and equal for all the beads ) , and @xmath62 is a 3d vector , whereof each component @xmath63 is an independent stochastic process , namely a nowhere differentiable function with @xmath64 , and @xmath65 . note that , for the sake of simplicity , we assume @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is a wiener process , namely a stochastic processes with stationary independent increments ( often called standard brownian motion).@xcite    the sum of these forces governs the jet dynamics according to the newton s equation providing the following non - linear langevin - like stochastic differential equation :    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the velocity of the @xmath3 bead . the velocity @xmath69 satisfies the kinematic relation :    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the position vector of the @xmath3 bead .",
    "the three eqs [ eq : stress - ode ] , [ eq : force - eom ] and [ eq : pos - eom ] form the set of eom governing the time evolution of the system .",
    "it is worth noting that eq .",
    "[ eq : force - eom ] recovers a deterministic eom in the limit @xmath45 and @xmath72 .",
    "furthermore , we define also the eom of the nozzle bead located in order to model fast mechanical perturbations at the spinneret.@xcite given the initial position of the nozzle @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the amplitude and the initial phase of the perturbation , respectively , the eom for the nozzle bead are :    @xmath77    @xmath78    where @xmath79 denotes the perturbation frequency .",
    "the actual perturbation at the nozzle produces a characteristic annular deposition of the fiber on the collector , as initially observed by reneker et al .",
    "altough the collected fibers observed in experimental findings show less regular fiber patterns , we find it convenient to investigate counterflow effects avoiding extra perturbations not directly related to the gaseous counterflow .",
    "thus , we focus our investigation on the specific perturbation effect due to a counterflow gas on the jet dynamics .    following previous works,@xcite the eom are integrated as follows .",
    "first , the time is discretized as a uniform sequence @xmath80 , @xmath81 . at each time step and for each @xmath3 jet bead",
    ", we firstly integrate the stochastic eq .",
    "[ eq : force - eom ] using the explicit integration scheme proposed by platen , @xcite with order of accuracy evaluated in literature equal to @xmath82 .",
    "then , the eqs .",
    "[ eq : pos - eom ] and [ eq : stress - ode ] are integrated via second order runge - kutta integrator , where the @xmath83 value was previously obtained via the platen scheme .",
    "solutions of polyvinylpyrrolidone ( pvp ) are largely used in electrospinning experiments . in this work ,",
    "we use a few simulation parameters developed by lauricella et al .",
    "@xcite and based on the experimental data provided by montinaro et al . @xcite .",
    "the process makes use of a solution of pvp ( molecular weight = 1300 kda ) prepared by a mixture of ethanol and water ( 17:3 v : v ) , at a concentration ranging between 11 and 21 mg / ml .",
    "the relevant parameters include mass , charge density , viscosity , elastic modulus , and surface tension , which were already included in the model as implemented in jetspin.@xcite the extra parameters related to the gas environment are modeled on the air ( density @xmath84 , and kinematic viscosity @xmath85 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath86 for the @xmath15-th bead is set to be @xmath55 for all the simulations .",
    "all the @xmath55 have the same value , and , consequently , @xmath86 is constant for all the beads .",
    "in addition , a perturbation is applied at the nozzle with frequency @xmath87 , as proposed by reneker et al.,@xcite whereas its amplitude @xmath75 is equal to @xmath88 mm .",
    "the voltage bias between the nozzle and the collector is 9 kv , and the collector is placed at 16 cm from the nozzle .",
    "the initial fluid velocity @xmath11 was estimated considering a solution pumped at constant flow rate of 2 ml / h in a needle of radius @xmath89micron .",
    "for convenience , all the simulation parameters are summarized in table [ tab : simulation - param ] .",
    "we probe three different conditions of air flow velocity , @xmath50 . in the first , we study the electrospinning process in absence of gas flow , @xmath90 , which will be use as a reference case ( _ case i _ ) . in the second and third , we take @xmath91 m / s ( _ case ii _ ) , and @xmath92 m / s ( _ case iii _ ) , whose magnitudes are similar to the jet velocity measured at the collector ( about 20 m / s ) in absence of gas streams .",
    "it is worth stressing that the gas flow is oriented along the @xmath9-axis , and the negative sign of @xmath50 indicates its opposite direction ( counterflow , from the collector towards the nozzle ) . for each of the three conditions",
    ", we run ten independent trajectories in order to perform a statistical analysis .",
    "all simulations were carried out by the modified version of the software package jetspin,@xcite and the corresponding eom were integrated with a time step of @xmath93 seconds over a simulation span of 0.5 seconds .    for the sake of convenience , we report below the definition of few observables , which will be used in the following .",
    "we define the jet length as :    @xmath94    with @xmath95 the position vector , and @xmath1 the number of jet beads .",
    "this observable takes note of the total length of the jet from the collector up to the nozzle .",
    "further , we introduce a suitable observable to assess the tortuosity of the path , which is defined as :    @xmath96    where @xmath97 is the position vector modulus of the closest bead to the collector .",
    "note that @xmath98 tends to 1 for a rectilinear jet , and it takes larger values depending on the complexity of the bending part of the jet .",
    "we also define the instantaneous angular aperture of the instability cone as :    @xmath99    with @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 the coordinates of the bead closest to the collector ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) .    in all the simulations",
    ", we observed two different regimes of the observables @xmath103 describing the process . in the first stage",
    ", the jet has not yet reached the collector , and we observe an initial transient of the observables .",
    "after the jet touches the collector , the observables start to fluctuate around a constant mean value , providing a stationary regime . as a consequence ,",
    "we discern two stages of the jet dynamics , hereafter denoted as early and late dynamics , respectively .      for each case , we compute the average values of observables describing the jet dynamics ( see fig . [",
    "fig : length - path ] ) .",
    "the averages are assessed at every step of the time integration , hence we obtain time dependent mean values of observables along the jet evolution . in table",
    "[ tab : mean - first - hitting ] we report the average first - hitting - time , @xmath104 , defined as the time that the jet initially takes to touch the collector . in particular , we note that the presence of a gas counterflow does not affect significantly the first - hitting - time , and the velocity of the jet bead at the collector is almost the same for all the three investigated cases ( within the margin of error ) . for the sake of completeness ,",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : velocity - time ] the time dependent mean velocity of the first bead as a function of time . on the other hand ,",
    "a significant increase of the jet length @xmath105 is found upon increasing the gas counterflow speed @xmath50 .",
    "this effect might be relevant for improving the quality of the resulting fibers , since longer jet lengths usually correspond to smaller cross sections of the deposited polymer filaments .",
    "such increment of @xmath105 is due to the greater complexity of the jet path , where bending instabilities play a significant role in determining the distance traveled from the nozzle to the collector .",
    "this is well represented by the @xmath98 parameter , which increases by 20 % in the _ case iii _",
    ", when the gas flow is set to @xmath106 m / s .",
    "the dynamics of bending instabilities also deserves few comments : we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : length - path ] the time dependent mean value of the jet length , @xmath107 , and tortuosity degree , @xmath108 , for each case under investigation . here , we find that bending instabilities start earlier for the _ case iii _ , triggering a larger jet path in the subsequent dynamics .",
    "this is well represented by the initial hump of @xmath108 , which is already equal to 5.0 after 0.002 seconds .",
    "the larger tortuosity degree is likely due to the lift force , which increases the local curvature of the jet , as shown in eq .",
    "[ eq : lift ] .",
    "hence , the synergic action of lift and coulomb repulsive forces boost bending instabilities at an earlier stage , and the _ case iii _ shows a different dynamics , which is clearly evident in the initial 0.005 seconds .",
    "this effect substantially differs from what is reported in literature for electrospinning models without external gas flows , where only coulomb repulsive forces contribute to the jet misalignement.@xcite    furthermore , we note that @xmath107 increases for all the cases both before and after the jet has touched the collector for the first time , indicating that bending instabilities reach a stationary regime of fluctuation at least after the time @xmath109 .",
    "we will consider this criteria in the following subsection , in order to discard the initial transient of dynamics for a correct statistical analysis of the stationary regime .",
    "we perform a statistical analysis of the positions of the jet beads over all the ten independent simulations for each of the three cases under investigation .",
    "in particular , we define an orthogonal box of dimensions @xmath110 along the @xmath9 , @xmath111 and @xmath112-axes , respectively .",
    "the orthogonal box is discretized in sub cubic cells of side equal to 1 mm , and the normalized numerical density field , denoted @xmath113 , is computed over all the box for each case . by construction , @xmath113 provides the probability to find a jet bead in the cubic cell identified by the indices @xmath15 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 . as above",
    ", we discard the initial part of each simulation , which corresponds to the early dynamics , so that only the late dynamics describing the stationary regime is considered .",
    "hence , the dynamics of each trajectory is evolved in time for 0.5 seconds .",
    "[ fig : density ] displays the isosurface of @xmath116 representing points of constant value 0.001 .",
    "the jet paths statistically lie on an empty cone , whose aperture slightly increases upon increasing the flow speed @xmath50 .",
    "in addition , the chaotic behavior of jets is found to be enhanced by high - speed gas flows .",
    "this is shown both by the larger statistical dispersion of the cone ( thickness of cone wall ) and by the different shape of the electrospun coatings deposited on the collector , which follow a fuzzier path ( gray fiber drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] ) .",
    "the different depositions of fibers for the three cases are highlighted by the normalized 2d maps in fig .",
    "[ fig : fist - collector ] , where we show the probability of a jet bead hitting the collector at the coordinates @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( note that the plate is perpendicular to @xmath9 by construction ) . here",
    ", all the distributions are found to draw almost regular circles , which subtend their relative instability cones of aperture angle @xmath117 .",
    "the probability distribution of hitting a specific point on the collector is remarkably peaked in the _ case i _ without gas flow , whereas the fiber deposition becomes less regular in the other cases .",
    "in particular , the distributions lie within two concentric circles , whose inner radius decreases , while the outer increases , as the air gas flow is enforced .",
    "the trend is a consequence of the more complex paths with highest tortuosity degree @xmath98 ( see _ case iii _ in table [ tab : mean - stationary ] ) drawn by the jets under the effects of strong perturbation forces in presence of a high speed gas counterflow .",
    "the snapshot related to the case iii in fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] represents well the chaotic route followed by the viscoelastic jet under the gas flow effects , which provides a longer jet path length @xmath118 , whose mean value @xmath119 increases by increasing the flow speed @xmath50 , as reported in table [ tab : mean - stationary ] . on the other hand , the mean values of the aperture angle @xmath117",
    "are not significantly altered by the gas flow ( see table [ tab : mean - stationary ] ) , showing that the instability mainly alters the statistical dispersion of the cone , but not in its mean value .",
    "the high - speed gas flow significantly affects the size distribution of the deposited fibers . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hist - radius ] we report the probability of collecting fibers with a given value of cross - sectional radius . here",
    ", we observe a nontrivial trend of the fiber radius as function of the air counterflow velocity .",
    "in particular , by applying an air flow velocity @xmath50 of -10 m / s ( _ case ii _ ) , we note a decrease in fiber radius by 10%-15% , and the fiber radius probability distributions become broader .",
    "the latter effect is even more evident for the _ case iii _",
    "( @xmath120 - 20 m / s ) , where the distribution computed over all the trajectories is spread out from its mean with values of fiber radius oscillating between @xmath121 and @xmath122 @xmath123 .",
    "further , we observe a non - symmetric distribution of the fiber radius for both the _ cases ii _ and _ iii _ , which may appear somehow counterintuitive .",
    "nonetheless , we wish to point out that skewed probability distributions are quite common in the statistical behavior of complex non - linear systems , such as the one considered here .",
    "fluid turbulence is a typical example in point @xcite .",
    "although finding the coarse - grained dynamic equations of motion with respect to the jet cross section is beyond the aim of the present work , we investigate the phenomenon by computing the average distribution of the jet radius along the curvilinear coordinate @xmath124 , where @xmath125 $ ] is introduced to parametrize the jet path , @xmath126 identifies the nozzle , and @xmath127 the filament at the collector . in fig . [",
    "fig : dist - radius - curvlin ] we report for all the three cases the median of the radius conditional distributions computed along the curvilinear coordinate @xmath124 ( the condition is the given value of @xmath124 ) .",
    "we also report the amplitudes of the conditional distributions evaluated as interquartile range . here",
    ", we observe that all the radius fluctuations are generated close to the nozzle .",
    "in particular , at @xmath128 we already note non - symmetric fluctuations of the jet radius for the _ cases ii _ and _ iii_. further , we observe larger average values of the curvature @xmath115 when the counterflow is activated .",
    "for instance , the averaged curvature measured at @xmath128 is 1.1 , 1.6 and 1.9 for the _ cases i _ , _ ii _ and _ iii _ , respectively .",
    "this is likely due to lift perturbation forces acting in junction with the coulomb repulsive forces , which produce sharp bends along the jet path already close to the nozzle , providing large fluctuations in the jet cross section .",
    "thus , the quality of the produced fibers is less controllable in presence of large counterflows ( as already evidenced in fig .",
    "[ fig : fist - collector ] for the _ case iii _ ) , and the beneficial effects of the gas stream in decreasing the fiber radius are largely counteracted .",
    "therefore , with the aim of producing thinner fibers and at achieving narrower size distributions of the deposited polymer filaments , the counterflow velocity @xmath50 should be carefully tuned , in order to provide an optimal balance between dissipative and perturbation forces as related to the gas stream .",
    "summarizing , we have investigated the dynamics of electrified polymer jets under different conditions of air drag force . in particular , we have probed the effects of a gas flow oriented towards the nozzle on the viscoelastic jet ( counterflow ) during the electrospinning process , analyzing both the early and the late dynamics .",
    "several observables have been employed to analyze the air drag effects on the jet bending instabilities , showing that the instability cone is altered in its shape and aperture by the presence of a gas stream .",
    "further , the results in terms of fiber deposition were also investigated by a statistical analysis of the late dynamics .",
    "we have observed that a controlled gas counterflow might lead to a decrease of the mean value of the fiber cross sectional radius . in particular ,",
    "our data show a nontrivial trend of the fiber radius as function of the air flow velocity applied in electrospinning experiment .",
    "in fact , the gas flow generates both dissipative and perturbation forces , which provide opposite effects on the resulting fiber cross section .",
    "thinner fibers are obtained by using a gas flow speed of -10 m / s .",
    "the complex interplay of effects due to air drag forces deserves a deeper investigation , which will be the subject of future work .",
    "however , further investigations will be needed and new terms have to be introduced to describe properly the disordered fiber structure experimentally observed on the collector .",
    "in particular , the effect of more complicated modeled perturbations of the nozzle in presence of air counterflow could provide a more realistic pattern of the filament on the collector . anyway",
    ", the released model represents an important novelty and it might be used for designing a new generation of devices with novel experimental components for gas - assisted electrospinning , in order to further investigate experimentally this process and to ultimately produce polymeric filaments with finely controlled average diameters and size distribution .",
