    "the digital nature of communication in networked control systems naturally induces sampling and quantization of signals . the increasing ubiquity of these systems , particularly in resource - constrained domains where communication channels have low",
    ", time - varying , and possibly unreliable channel capacity , has brought to the forefront the need for integrated and systematic design methodologies that go beyond adhoc approaches .",
    "this paper is a contribution to the modern body of research that seeks to fundamentally address the problem of control under constrained resources .",
    "specifically , we seek to combine the strengths of event - triggered control and information theory to efficiently stabilize linear time - invariant systems under communication constraints .",
    "_ literature review : _ the need for integration between computing , communication , and control in the study of cyberphysical systems can not be overemphasized  @xcite .",
    "the present work builds on two areas of research that address the stabilization of control systems under limited information from different and complementary perspectives . in the information - theoretic approach to control under communication constraints ,",
    "the focus is on determining sufficient and necessary conditions on the _ bit data rates _",
    "( i.e. , the number of bits transmitted over possibly multiple transmissions during an arbitrary time interval ) that guarantee stabilization under varying assumptions on the communication channels . the works  @xcite provide comprehensive accounts of this by now vast literature , and we highlight next a few references most relevant to the discussion here .",
    "early data rate results appeared in  @xcite , which employ the idea of countering the information generated ( the growth in the uncertainty of the system state ) with a sufficiently high data rate of the encoded feedback .",
    "this approach has been successful in providing tight necessary and sufficient conditions on the data rate of the encoded feedback for asymptotic stabilization in the discrete - time setting .",
    "similar ideas have been used to provide data rate theorems also for stochastic rate channels  @xcite and extended to vector systems and time - varying feedback channels  @xcite and markov feedback channels  @xcite . in the continuous - time setting ,",
    "the problem has been mainly studied under either periodic sampling or aperiodic sampling with known upper and lower bounds on the sampling period for single input systems  @xcite , nonlinear feedforward systems  @xcite , and switched linear systems  @xcite . in this context , it is not known if and how a best sampling period may be designed or if state - based aperiodic sampling can provide any advantage in efficiency and performance . with a few exceptions , see e.g. ,  @xcite , the works above do not characterize the convergence rates or explore the problem of guaranteeing a desired performance .",
    "event - triggered control , instead , trades computation and decision - making for less communication , sensing , or actuation effort , while guaranteeing a desired level of performance .",
    "this literature , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein , exploits the tolerance to measurement errors to design goal - driven state - based aperiodic sampling for the efficient use of the system resources .",
    "the main focus of this body of work is on minimizing the number of updates while guaranteeing the feasibility of the resulting real - time implementation .",
    "when interpreted in terms of communication , this results in a paradigm where one seeks to minimize the number of transmissions while largely ignoring the quantization aspect and allowing the data at each transmission to be of infinite precision . among the few exceptions , we mention event - triggered schemes with static logarithmic quantization  @xcite and dynamic quantization  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "events are defined as the system state crossing static quantization cells and communication is assumed to be instantaneous and there are no disturbances .",
    "@xcite considers the problem with modeling errors and communication delays .",
    "both these papers do not explicitly study the notion of _ communication bit rate _",
    "( i.e. , the number of bits per transmission ) . in  @xcite ,",
    "the events are defined as the infinity norm of the encoding error crossing a fixed or piecewise - constant threshold .",
    "@xcite considers instantaneous communication and external disturbances , although the use of a fixed threshold in the event - triggering condition results in practical stability even under no disturbance .",
    "in addition , if the channel imposes a bound on the communication bit rate , then it also affects the ultimate bound on the state .",
    "@xcite addresses the problem for nonlinear systems and with communication delays , while  @xcite extend these results to the case with external disturbance .",
    "all these works guarantee a positive lower bound on the inter - transmission times , while  @xcite also provide a uniform bound on the communication bit rate . however , these references do not address the inverse problem of triggering and quantization given a limit on the communication bit rate imposed by the channel . while guarantees on the uniform boundedness of the communication bit rate are useful , they do not characterize either necessary or sufficient conditions on the required data rates , i.e. , the number of bits averaged over a finite or infinite time horizon .",
    "in fact , this is a shortcoming of the event - triggered control literature as a whole , where the availability of such analytical results would help in the design of networked control systems .",
    "finally , the common underlying approach in the event - triggered literature is based on the notion of input - to - state - stability with respect to measurement errors for both event - triggering and quantization .",
    "this is in contrast with the information - theoretic data rate approach to quantization and encoding adopted here .    _",
    "statement of contributions : _ this paper designs event - triggered controllers for linear - time invariant systems under bounded communication bit rate .",
    "we focus on the control goal of exponential practical stabilization , in the presence of disturbance and with a prescribed rate of convergence .",
    "the first contribution is the identification of a necessary condition on the average data rate required for all solutions of a linear - time invariant system to exponentially converge with a prescribed convergence rate .",
    "our second set of contributions pertain to the design of event - triggered controllers that guarantee exponential convergence with a desired performance by adjusting the communication rate in accordance with state information in an opportunistic fashion .",
    "we consider increasingly realistic scenarios , ranging from instantaneous transmissions with arbitrary , but finite communication rate , through instantaneous transmissions with uniformly bounded communication rate , to finally non - instantaneous transmissions with arbitrary bounded communication rate imposed by the channel . in all cases",
    ", our design guarantees the existence of a uniform positive lower bound on inter - transmission and inter - reception times , and ensures that the number of bits transmitted at each transmission is upper bounded .",
    "an overarching contribution of the paper is the introduction of the information - theoretic data rate approach to quantization and encoding to complement event - triggering for data rate limited feedback control . from an event - triggered control perspective",
    ", our key contribution is going beyond the paradigm of infinite precision at each transmission and adopting the information - theoretic approach to quantization , encoding , and triggering .",
    "this allows us to characterize necessary and sufficient data rates averaged over time , and quantify the capability to transmit fewer bits if more bits than prescribed were transmitted earlier . from an information - theoretic perspective , our key contribution is the efficient use of the communication resources by exploiting state - based opportunistic sampling .",
    "this allows us to tune the operation of the control system to the desired level of performance and guarantee a desired convergence rate . in order to communicate the main ideas effectively",
    ", we use a simple encoding scheme and assume that the encoder and the decoder know the communication delays in the case of non - instantaneous communication .",
    "these are aspects that may be improved upon within the framework of the paper .",
    "finally , we believe the approach laid out here opens up numerous avenues for further research at the intersection of information theory , control , and stabilization .",

    "we assume that the pair @xmath38 is stabilizable , i.e. , there exists a control gain matrix @xmath39 such that the matrix @xmath40 is hurwitz , and that the disturbance is uniformly bounded by a known constant , i.e. , @xmath41 under these assumptions , @xmath42 renders the origin of   globally exponentially practically stable .",
    "the plant is equipped with a sensor and an actuator , which are not co - located .",
    "we assume that the sensor can measure the state exactly , and that the actuator can exert the input to the plant with infinite precision .",
    "however , the sensor has the ability to transmit state information to the controller at the actuator only at discrete time instants of its choice and using only a finite number of bits . in this sense",

    "we let @xmath43 be the sequence of _ transmission ( or encoding ) times _ at which the sensor decides to sample , encode , and transmit the plant state .",

    "we let @xmath46 be the sequence of _ reception ( or update ) times _ at which the decoder receives a complete packet of data , decodes it , and updates the controller state .",
    "therefore , @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath48 communication time @xmath49 is then a function of @xmath45 and the packet size ( of @xmath44 bits ) represented by @xmath50 , @xmath51 in general , the time @xmath52 could include communication time , computation time and other delays .",
    "we refer to the case @xmath53 by instantaneous communication . to keep things simple ,",
    "we assume the encoder and the decoder have synchronized clocks and synchronously update their states at update times @xmath46 .",
    "the latter assumption is justified in situations where @xmath54 is independent of @xmath55 or where the encoder and decoder send short synchronization signals to indicate the start of encoding and the end of decoding , respectively .",
    "we use dynamic quantization for finite - bit transmissions from the encoder to the decoder . in dynamic quantization , there are two distinct phases : the zoom - out stage , during which no control is applied while the quantization domain is expanded until it captures the system state at time @xmath56 ; and the zoom - in stage , during which the encoded feedback is used to asymptotically stabilize the system .",
    "a detailed description of the zoom - out stage can be found in the literature , e.g. ,  @xcite . here ,",

    "the state of the encoder / decoder is composed of the controller state @xmath58 and an upper bound @xmath59 on the norm of the encoding error @xmath60 .",

    "we allow the quantization domain , the number of bits and the resulting quantizer , @xmath75 , at each transmission instant @xmath76 to be variable .",
    "note that the evaluation of the map @xmath75 is inherently from the encoder s perspective because it depends on the plant state @xmath77 , which is unknown to the decoder .",
    "also , while the encoder could store @xmath69 , the decoder has to infer its value if @xmath78 .",
    "we detail the specifics of the decoder s procedure to implement   when communication is not instantaneous later .",
    "the evolution of the plant state @xmath79 and the encoding error  @xmath80 on the time interval @xmath81 can be written as    [ eq : dynamics - x - xe ] @xmath82    note that while the controller state @xmath72 is known to both the encoder and the decoder , the plant state ( equivalently , the encoding error @xmath80 ) is known only to the encoder .",
    "however , at @xmath83 , if a bound on @xmath84 is available , then both the encoder and the decoder can compute a bound @xmath85 on @xmath86 for any @xmath87 , as we explain later .",

    "since the result only relies on comparing the volumes of the sets @xmath107 and @xmath158 , rather than on ensuring the stricter condition @xmath159 for @xmath57 , it remains to be seen how a necessary or even a sufficient data rate condition would depend on the control gain @xmath160 and the sequence of communication times @xmath161 . in general , a time - triggered implementation with the given control goal and communication constraints could be very conservative .",
    "this motivates our forthcoming investigation of event - triggered designs .",
