    "thermoelectricity deals with conversion of heat to electricity and vice versa .",
    "last few years , mainly due to the recent advances in material science and fabrication techniques on the one hand and a quest for alternative sources of energy generation on the other hand , have witnessed a rejuvenation of interest in the thermoelectric phenomena @xcite-@xcite .",
    "performance of a thermoelectric device is defined through its dimensionless figure - of - merit @xmath4 . here",
    ", @xmath5 is the absolute temperature , @xmath6 stands for the thermopower ( the seebeck coefficient ) , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent the electrical and thermal conductivities , respectively . at first glance , a large @xmath1 might be achievable by maximizing @xmath7 and @xmath6 , and by minimizing @xmath8 .",
    "the problem , however , lies in the fact that these quantities are interdependent and each of them is rather sensitive to the material properties , to the temperature , and to the size and geometry of the underlying building blocks in a miniaturized thermoelectric module .",
    "consequently , often one of the two not - completely - independent strategies is exploited : increasing of the power factor @xmath9 which is largely an electronic property , or decreasing of @xmath8 which consists of electronic @xmath10 and lattice @xmath11 contributions by manipulation of the latter .",
    "a large @xmath12 can be achieved by tuning of the chemical potential level through doping or external electric fields ( gating ) and by having control over the scattering mechanisms of the charge carriers in the device .",
    "reduction in @xmath11 , instead , can be obtained by exploitation of material systems built up from heavy elements and by intentional enhancement of the phonon scattering events through introduction of lattice imperfections ( impurity atoms , superlattice structures , _ etc . _ ) or by intensifying of the surface scattering of the heat carriers from the specimen boundaries in the systems with reduced dimensionality .    in what follows , assuming a constant @xmath11 , we focus on the charge carrier contributions to the thermoelectric properties of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) wire with discrete energy levels . to demonstrate the applicability of the present approach , we evaluate @xmath1 in bismuth telluride nanowires and discuss the obtained results with an eye on the predictions of the earlier models .",
    "current generic models ( as compared to the _ ab initio _ calculations ) for evaluation of the thermoelectric figure - of - merit are mostly based on the solution of boltzmann transport equation ( bte ) with various degrees of sophistications .",
    "an efficient approximation for solving bte can be attained by its linearization and through introduction of a relaxation time @xmath0 , the time period within which the system gains its equilibrium after removal of the external stimulus @xcite .",
    "consequently , the components of the transport tensors of the system @xmath13_{\\alpha\\delta}$ ] can be obtained through the relation @xmath14_{\\alpha\\delta}=\\frac{\\nu{q^{2-l}}}{2\\pi}\\int(-{{\\partial}_{e } f_{0 } } ) { \\tau({\\bf k})}({e}({\\bf k})-{\\zeta } ) ^{l}{\\bf v}_{\\alpha } { \\bf v}_{\\delta}{\\rm d}{\\bf k},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 designates the electrical conductivity , @xmath16 is the seebeck coefficient , and @xmath17 $ ] is the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity @xcite . above , @xmath18 is the electrical carrier charge , @xmath19 is the energy - wavevector dispersion relation , @xmath20 defines the velocity operator ( @xmath21 is the reduced planck constant ) , and @xmath22 is the valley degeneracy .",
    "the equilibrium fermi - dirac distribution function is given by @xmath23^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the boltzmann constant ) and @xmath26 denotes the chemical potential",
    ".    the precise form of the dispersion relation above can only be derived through detailed band structure calculations and depends strongly on the material properties and on the boundary conditions in the system of interest .",
    "similarly , the relaxation time for any specific process depends on the density of energy states ( dos ) and on the types of the scattering mechanisms taken into account . in most calculations",
    ", however , one expresses dos via the single - particle eigenenergies and assumes a power - law dependence of the relaxation time on energy , @xmath27 .",
    "it was only under such conditions that a. f. ioffe arrived at his compact expressions in terms of the fermi - dirac integrals for the evaluation of the transport coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ basiclmn ] ) above @xcite . despite this",
    ", such basic assumptions have been widely overlooked in the latter evaluations of the @xmath1 values in low - dimensional systems , leading ultimately to the estimations of unrealistically high , monotonously size - dependent , @xmath1 s in atomically thin nanowires @xcite .",
    "it is worth reminding that in the limit of ultra narrow nanowires , the whole concept of a size - independent dos and any argument subsequent to it will collapse . in such cases , one has to resort to the other proper techniques like , _",
    "e.g. _ , tight - binding models and check for the validity of the obtained results self - consistently . furthermore , as shown elsewhere @xcite , even minor variations in the form of dos [ and subsequent changes in @xmath28 will affect @xmath1 values dramatically .",
    "it is also elucidating to remind that , based on a purely mathematical analysis of the functional in eq .",
    "( [ basiclmn ] ) , mahan and sofo estimate in @xcite a universal ( that is , independent of size , temperature , and specific material properties ) finite upper limit for @xmath1 in semiconductor thermoelectric materials . based on these facts and to circumvent the above - mentioned crucial shortcomings in the existing theoretical models for low - dimensional thermoelectric systems , starting with the basic principles , below we obtain the transport coefficients and @xmath1 values specifically for a 1d nanowire with quantized energy levels .",
    "the key issue in such a treatment is the derivation of a proper , _ i.e. _ size and energy dependent , expression for the relaxation time .",
    "let us assume that @xmath29 scatterers each with a scattering strength @xmath30 are randomly distributed at positions @xmath31 along the wire , @xmath32 , and make use of the fermi s golden rule @xmath33 to derive the corresponding scattering rates . by averaging over the configuration of the scattering centers @xcite , we arrive at @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "here , @xmath37 is the volume of the wire ; @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the lateral dimensions and @xmath40 stands for the wire length",
    ". the energy density of states per unit volume is given by @xmath41 here , @xmath42 is the component of the charge carrier mass along the wire axis , @xmath43 is the spin degeneracy , and @xmath44 designates the heaviside step function .",
    "above , use has been made of the fact that the single - particle wave functions and the corresponding eigenenergies of a carrier confined in lateral dimensions @xmath45 and @xmath46 and traveling freely along the @xmath47-axis are given by @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively ; @xmath50 are the subband energies , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the wavenumber .    in eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) above , as in most cases the density and strength of scatterers are unknown and may vary from one individual wire to other , one can make use of the definition of carrier mobility @xmath53 and account for the product @xmath54 through @xcite @xmath55 where the lifetime of the state @xmath56 is defined through the relation @xmath57 and its expectation value as @xmath58 . here",
    ", @xmath59 is the reduced energy and @xmath60 is the effective mass ( for a 1d wire aligned along the @xmath47-axis , @xmath61 ) . now , substituting for the corresponding expressions and making a coordinate transformation where @xmath62 and the reduced chemical potential @xmath63 ( for electrons ) are measured from the bottom of the conduction band @xcite , the transport coefficients in eq .",

    "( the contribution of the holes can be accounted for analogously . )",
    "this equation has to be compared to the corresponding ones based on a size - independent power - low rta approach introduced originally in @xcite and exploited later by dresselhaus and coworkers in their pivotal @xcite and subsequent studies @xcite on low - dimensional thermoelectric systems .",
    "next , we evaluate @xmath1 for a bismuth telluride nanowire at @xmath68 k and at @xmath69 k. to make the comparison between the predictions of the present model and those of the previous studies @xcite more transparent , we use the same material parameters , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 for the electronic effective masses ( all in units of the free electron mass ) , and take the same value for the mobility of electrons , @xmath73 @xmath74v@xmath75s@xmath75 .",
    "the lattice thermal conductivity of bulk bi@xmath2te@xmath3 is @xmath76 w / km .",
    "the phonon confinement effects become considerable only if the lateral dimensions of the wire , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , are comparable in size to the phonon mean free path @xmath77 . as for bismuth",

    "( b ) * @xmath68 k.    figure 1 shows dependence of the electronic contribution to the figure - of - merit of a wire with square cross - section on its size @xmath38 and on @xmath85 . here",
    ", in contrast to the constant-@xmath0 model of hicks and dresselhaus ( hd ) ( see , the appendix ) , dependence of @xmath1 on wire size is non - monotonous and after reaching its optimum at a certain width and chemical potential , falls starkly to zero .",
    "this is a direct consequence of disappearance of electronic density of states for ultra thin wires .",
    "the most distinct differences between the two models are as follow : the peak values of the @xmath7 , @xmath10 , and @xmath1 in the present model show a shift toward larger wire thicknesses , @xmath86 nm , as compared to the plain @xmath87-dependence of the corresponding quantities predicted by the hd model ; the thermopower @xmath6 given here is temperature dependent and reaches the overall high values of the hd model only in very narrow wires ; in contrast to the hd model , here the position of optimum @xmath1 in @xmath88-plane has a visible dependence on temperature and , as temperature falls down , shifts toward higher thicknesses ; the asymptotic values of the transport coefficients for a model square wire with @xmath89 nm given by the hd model are unrealistically smaller than the those obtained here ( table 1 ; see also the table in appendix ) .    to illustrate the effect of subband contributions and that of qses , the calculations were repeated for the first three subbands , up to @xmath90 ( see , fig .",
    "2 ) . table 1 summarizes the results . here , especially at @xmath68",
    "k , one can distinguish two clear maxima for @xmath7 , @xmath91 , and @xmath6 which arise from qses @xcite and which are smeared out in @xmath1 .",
    "this observation is rather general for other subbands too and is a consequence of the fact that @xmath7 and @xmath10 have similar functional dependencies on the wire size and the qses distinguishable independently in each of them ( and to a lesser extent in @xmath6 ) are compensated in @xmath1 by one another .",
    "another interesting observation is the abrupt enhancement of @xmath91 at thinner wire diameters and in the region where @xmath85 approaches its optimum . here , noticeably , @xmath92 .",
    "alike , the hd model predicts an even stronger enhancement of @xmath10 in thinner wires ( appendix ) .",
