    "measurements rely on the international system of units ( si)@xcite which is a consistent system constructed historically on seven based units namely the meter ( m ) , the kilogram ( kg ) , the second ( s ) , the ampere ( a ) , the kelvin ( k ) , the mole ( mol ) and the candela ( cd ) , all other units being formed as products of powers of the base units .",
    "the si has always evolved following the scientific knowledge with the aim to decrease the uncertainty in the measurements , but also with the aim of universality .",
    "this is best illustrated by the history of the definition of the meter which was first based on an artefact then on a reference to an atomic transition and more recently related to the second through a fixed value of the speed of light @xmath3 expressed in the unit m.s@xmath4 .",
    "this success has guided the choice for the future revision of the si @xcite , in which the definitions of the seven base units will be based on constants ranging from fundamental constants of nature to technical constants @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanics will be fully exploited by fixing the values of the planck constant _ h _ and of the elementary charge _",
    "e_. from the definitions of the second and the meter , these fundamental constants expressed in the units @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively will set the definitions of the kilogram@xcite and of the ampere@xcite without specifying the experiment for their realizations . the mass unit , bound to _ h _",
    ", will be no more realized by the international prototype of the kilogram suspected drifting with time but for example using the watt balance experiment@xcite .",
    "similarly , the ampere will be realized from the elementary charge _",
    "e _ and the frequency @xmath7 , and no longer from ampre s force law@xcite which relates electrical units to mechanical units and thereby limits the relative uncertainty to a few parts in @xmath8@xcite .    a direct way to realize the ampere from the elementary charge and the frequency @xmath9 , illustrated in fig.1a ,",
    "is based on single - electron tunneling ( set ) devices@xcite in mesoscopic systems at very low temperatures where the charge quantization manifests itself due to coulomb blockade @xcite . among set devices ,",
    "electron pumps@xcite transfer a precise number @xmath10 of charge @xmath11 at each cycle of a control parameter which is synchronized to an external frequency @xmath12 , so that the amplitude of the output current is ideally equal to @xmath13 , _ i.e _ theoretically equal to @xmath14 .",
    "the first electron pumps consisted of small metallic islands in series isolated by tunnel junctions . in a 7-junction device",
    ", an error rate per cycle of @xmath15 was measured for frequencies in the mhz range@xcite .",
    "the accuracy of such devices , obtained by charging a cryogenic capacitor with a precise number of electrons@xcite , was then demonstrated with a relative uncertainty of @xmath16 for currents below 1 pa@xcite .",
    "a similar experiment reached a relative uncertainty of @xmath17 with a 5-junction r - pump@xcite ( fig.1b ) . recently",
    ", alternative electron pumps based on tunable barriers in a non - adiabatic regime were proposed as a trade - off between accuracy and increased current , as reviewed in references @xcite . in most recent devices operating at very low temperatures ( @xmath18 ) and under high magnetic fields ( @xmath19 ) , the quantization of the current was demonstrated with relative measurement uncertainties of @xmath20 at 150 pa ( @xmath21)@xcite and @xmath22 at 90 pa ( @xmath23)@xcite ( fig.1b ) .        as illustrated in fig.1a , the future definition of the ampere",
    "can also be realized by applying ohm s law to the quantum voltage and resistance standards that are based on the josephson effect ( je)@xcite , and the quantum hall effect ( qhe)@xcite , two gauge - invariant macroscopic quantum effects that involve the josephson and the von klitzing constants , @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "more precisely , the ac ( alternative current ) je converts the frequency @xmath9 of an electromagnetic wave to a voltage @xmath26 with the constant @xmath27 . this effect is characterized by the appearance of quantized voltage steps ( shapiro steps)@xcite , at values @xmath28 in the current - voltage characteristic of a josephson junction irradiated by a microwave field of frequency @xmath2 , where @xmath29 is an integer .",
    "this can be understood as the transfer of an integer number of flux quanta @xmath30 per microwave cycle due to the circulation of a current of cooper pairs .",
    "the qhe links the current @xmath31 to the voltage @xmath26 through the constant @xmath32 .",
    "this quantum phenomenon manifests itself in a device based on a two - dimensional electron gas under a perpendicular magnetic field , by the quantization of the hall resistance at values @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is an integer .",
    "this comes from the existence at fermi energy of @xmath34 one - dimensional ballistic chiral states@xcite of conductance @xmath35 each at the device edges , and the absence of delocalized states in the bulk due to the opening of a gap in the energy spectrum ( the density of states is quantized in landau levels ) . from the application of ohm s law to these two quantum standards , the frequency @xmath9 can therefore be converted in a current @xmath31 with the constant @xmath36 .",
    "it is planned that the relationships @xmath37 and @xmath38 will be assumed in the new si .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption since no measurable deviation has been predicted by quantum mechanics@xcite and no significant deviation has been demonstrated experimentally , either by independent determinations of the constants in the relations@xcite or by universality tests .",
    "several experiments have indeed demonstrated the universality of the je and the qhe with relative measurements uncertainties below @xmath39@xcite and @xmath40@xcite respectively . in the new si ,",
    "the josephson voltage standard ( jvs ) and the quantum hall resistance standard ( qhrs ) would therefore become realizations of the ohm and the volt with relative uncertainties below @xmath41 , only limited by their experimental implementation , and no longer by the uncertainties on @xmath42 and @xmath43 of @xmath44@xcite and @xmath45@xcite respectively , in the present si ( appendix a ) .",
    "applying ohm s law to those standards in the new si would result in a current standard which can be expressed as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 has an exact value .",
    "the expectation is to reach an accurate quantum current standard realizing the ampere definition with a high level of reproducibility and universality , which directly benefits from that of the jvs and the qhrs .",
    "this goal was unattainable with the former definition established in 1948 . nowadays",
    ", national metrology institutes already apply ohm s law to secondary voltage and resistance standards , traceable to @xmath42 and @xmath43 , for the current traceability .",
    "however , the uncertainty claimed in their calibration and measurement capabilities ( cmc ) for current , reported in fig.1b , is in practice not better than @xmath48@xcite . above @xmath49 , this limitation",
    "is mainly caused by higher calibration uncertainties of secondary standards and the lack of accurate and stable true current sources , while below this current limit , the uncertainty which increases steadily towards lower current levels is rather due a lack of sensitivity of the measurement techniques .",
    "these cmcs emphasize the advantage of an accurate reference current standard able to deliver high currents in order to optimize and shorten the current traceability in nmis over a wide range of values above @xmath49 . in the range of lower currents",
    ", a traceability improvement might be expected by exploiting not only set devices as quantum current standards but also accurate current amplifiers to make the link between low currents and higher current references .",
    "a recent example of low - noise amplifiers that operates at room temperature , is an ultra low - noise current amplifier ( ulca ) @xcite , stable within @xmath50 over one week and having a typical long term drift of @xmath51 per year .",
    "the downscaling approach also further motivates the development of current standards with large values .    here , we report on a programmable quantum current generator ( pqcg ) , linked to the elementary charge _",
    ", which is built from an application of ohm s law to quantum standards combined in an original quantum circuit ( fig.1c ) .",
    "shortly , it is based on a current source locked , by means of an highly - accurate cryogenic amplifier of gain @xmath52 using a magnetic coupling , to a multiple or fraction value of a programmable quantum current standard ( pqcs ) used as a reference .",
    "the pqcs is the current circulating in a closed circuit formed by a josephson voltage @xmath53 applied to a quantum hall resistance standard @xmath54 using a special connection scheme which drastically reduces the two - wires series resistance ( @xmath55 ) thanks to the qhe properties and which allows its accurate detection by the amplifier .",
    "1d demonstrates that currents generated by the pqcg from @xmath56 to @xmath57 are perfectly quantized in terms of @xmath58 , within a combined standard uncertainty ( appendix b ) of @xmath0 ( one standard deviation or 1 s.d . ) . by principle , this new standard is programmable and versatile , _ i.e. _ it can generate currents over a wide range of values , extending from 10 ma down to @xmath49 .",
    "the pqcg uncertainty budget reported in fig.1b by the red dashed - dotted line shows that the accuracy is unchanged in the whole current range .",
    "the pqcg is a primary quantum current standard , accurate over a wide current range , able to greatly improve the current measurement traceability by reducing uncertainties of two orders of magnitude compared to those declared in best cmcs .",
    "this is demonstrated by the calibration of a digital ammeter ( da ) on several current ranges from @xmath49 to 5 ma with measurement uncertainties only limited by the device under test .",
    "more fundamentally , the pqcg is able to implement the future ampere definition in terms of the elementary charge _",
    "e _ with the target uncertainty of @xmath0 .",
    "this will rely on the adoption of the solid - state quantum theory in the planned new si . in this context ,",
    "demonstrating the equivalence of the two quantum realizations of the ampere described in fig.1a , so - called closing the metrological triangle@xcite , is a challenging experiment of great interest .",
    "improvements in its realization are expected from the pqcg and the quantum circuit methods reported here .",
    "the experimental scheme of the pqcg , described in fig.2a , aims at realizing the principle shown in fig.1c .",
    "the pqcs is built from a programmable josephson voltage standard ( pjvs)@xcite which is used to maintain the quantized voltage at the terminals of a quantum hall resistance standard ( qhrs)@xcite of resistance @xmath59 .",
    "the pjvs is based on a 1 v series array of sinis josephson junctions@xcite , where s , i and n correspond to superconductor , insulator and normal metal respectively , operating at frequencies @xmath60 .",
    "the array is divided in segments that can be individually biased on the @xmath61 or @xmath62 shapiro steps by a programmable bias source .",
    "the quantized voltage steps are given by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is now the number of biased junctions on the first shapiro step and which can be as large as several thousands ( fig.2b and appendix c.1 ) .",
    "the current @xmath65 circulating in the josephson array , of a few tens of @xmath66 , is well below the current amplitude of the shapiro steps and ensures a perfect quantization of the qhrs ( appendix c.2 ) .",
    "the pjvs and the qhrs are individually checked following the usual technical guidelines@xcite .    a simple connection of the pjvs to the qhrs would not allow realizing @xmath67 with the highest accuracy because of the large value of the two - wires series resistance ( symbolized by @xmath68 in fig.1c ) caused by the connecting links .",
    "a multiple series connection of the qhrs@xcite , a technique which exploits fundamental properties of the qhe , is implemented to reduce their effect .",
    "each superconducting pad of the pjvs is connected to two qhrs terminals located along an equipotential edge of the hall bar ( fig.2a ) . due to the chirality of the hall edge - states for the given magnetic field direction",
    ", @xmath65 essentially flows in the link of resistance ( @xmath69 ) ( typically @xmath70 ) .",
    "this gives rise to a voltage @xmath71 .",
    "because of the edge equipotentiality and knowing that the two - terminal resistance is @xmath72 in the qhe regime , a small current @xmath73 circulates this time , in the connection link probing the hall voltage .",
    "this results in a small voltage , no more than @xmath74 , that adds to the hall voltage @xmath75 .",
    "this gives a relative correction to the quantized hall resistance , @xmath76 , of @xmath77 ( typically @xmath78 ) much lower than @xmath79 ( typically @xmath80 ) for a single connection .",
    "for some measurements , a third terminal was connected at top of the qhe cryostat ( dotted line in fig.2a ) to further reduce the correction . in general , @xmath65 can be written as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is a small relative correction that is calculated taking into account the resistance of all connections ( appendix d ) . in our experiments ,",
    "this correction @xmath82 of no more than @xmath83 , is determined with an uncertainty of @xmath84 .",
    "the validity of this relationship giving @xmath65 assumes a perfect equipotentiality in the superconducting pads where voltage and current terminals of the qhrs are connected .",
    "the quantized current @xmath65 can be rewritten as @xmath85 , a form which is very similar to the expression of the current generated by the electron pumps , @xmath14 .",
    "this reflects that both ways to realize the ampere , _",
    "i.e. _ from set devices and from the application of ohm s law to quantum standards ( fig.1a ) , are theoretically equivalent .",
    "it also points out that @xmath65 corresponds to the circulation of @xmath29 elementary charges per cycle of the external frequency . because @xmath64 and @xmath86 are orders of magnitude larger than @xmath87 and @xmath12,the pqcs , and consequently the pqcg can generate higher currents than set devices .",
    "the accuracy of the pqcg also relies on the detection and then the amplification with gain @xmath52 of the quantized current @xmath65 while keeping the accuracy .",
    "this is achieved using a cryogenic current comparator ( ccc)@xcite(see appendix c.3 ) which is able to accurately compare currents with a relative uncertainty of a few @xmath88 .",
    "the ccc accuracy relies on ampre s theorem and the perfect diamagnetism of the superconductive toroidal shield ( meissner effect ) , in which several superconducting windings of variable number of turns are embedded .",
    "its current sensitivity relies on a dc ( direct current ) superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) detecting the flux generated by the screening current circulating on the shield ( fig.2a ) .",
    "more precisely , two windings of equal number of turns @xmath89 ( 128 or 129 ) are inserted in the connections to the qhrs on the low potential side of the circuit , _",
    "i.e. _ the grounded pjvs side , in order to detect the sum of the currents in the two windings , hence @xmath65 .",
    "it is essential to cancel the leakage current that could alter the accurate equality of the total currents circulating in the qhrs and in these two windings .",
    "this is achieved by placing high and low potentials cables ( high - insulation @xmath90 resistance ) connected to the qhrs inside two separated shields , that are then twisted together and connected to ground . by this way",
    ", direct leakage currents short - circuiting the qhrs , the most troublesome , are cancelled .",
    "other leakage currents are redirected to ground .",
    "they lead to a relative error on the detected current , negligible , of no more than @xmath91@xcite .",
    "a third ccc winding , of number of turns @xmath92 ( chosen between 1 and 4130 ) , is connected to an external battery - powered and low - noise current source servo - controlled by the feedback voltage of the dc squid and which delivers the current @xmath93 so that the total ampere.turn in the ccc is zero ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "the current source is therefore locked to @xmath65 and generates a quantized current @xmath93 theoretically equal to @xmath95 , where @xmath96 spans two orders of magnitude above or below the unity gain .",
    "the ccc relying on a magnetic coupling between windings , it allows a high electrical - insulation between the pqcs and the external circuit connected to the devices under test that protects from an alteration of the pqcs quantization .",
    "@xmath52 is the main control parameter determining the range of the output current .",
    "the fine programmability of the quantized current @xmath93 can be achieved either by changing @xmath64 or @xmath2 .",
    "another option consists in tuning the ccc gain using a calibrated current divider that derives a fraction @xmath97 of the current in a fourth ccc winding ( @xmath98 turns ) . in this case",
    ", the resulting ccc gain can be expressed as @xmath99 .",
    "@xmath97 can be varied over a range @xmath100 and is determined with a standard uncertainty @xmath101 . the accuracy in realizing the gain depends on the feedback electronics . to avoid significant error caused by the finite value of the amplifier gain of the squid electronics ,",
    "the total ampere.turn value in the ccc is nominally strongly reduced by a fine tuning of the external current source using @xmath102 as indicated in fig.2a . moreover , the gain of the feedback loop is set at the largest value possible that maintains the squid locked during on - off switchings of the current ( controlled by the on - off switchings of @xmath103 ) . in these conditions , the relative quantization error of the pqcg , related to the finite open loop gain , is lower than @xmath104 ( see appendix e ) .",
    "the noise of the pqcg current , @xmath105 , originates from @xmath65 and the gain @xmath106 .",
    "it manifests itself in the flux detection by the squid of the ccc amplifier .",
    "@xmath105 , can be expressed in relative value by @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the flux noise amplitude density detected by the squid and @xmath109 is the flux to ampere.turn sensitivity of the ccc .",
    "this expression shows that , the larger the number of josephson junctions @xmath29 and the number of turns @xmath89 , the better the signal to noise . @xmath110 results from the squid noise @xmath111 , the johnson - nyquist noise of the qhrs resistance and some external noise @xmath112 captured by the measurement circuit . note that the noise of the external current source servo - controlled by the squid is of no concern in the operation frequency bandwidth ( @xmath113 1 khz ) of the squid feedback . in these conditions , @xmath114 , where _ _ t__=1.3 k is the qhrs temperature",
    "the flux noise density generated by the qhrs , of @xmath115 , is well below the base noise ( @xmath116 ) measured by the squid operating in the bare ccc ( appendix c.3 ) , as reported in fig.2d ( black curve ) .",
    "experimentally , the pqcg involves three quantum devices placed in independent cryogenic setups .",
    "the quantum devices are connected together using long shielded cables made of twisted pairs .",
    "given the high - sensitivity of the squid to electromagnetic noise , achieving a stable and accurate operation of the pqcg was a challenge .",
    "to ensure the squid stability using @xmath89 as large as 129 , it was necessary to connect a damping circuit to a fifth ccc winding ( @xmath117 ) in order to avoid the amplification of the current noise in the pqcs loop at the resonance frequency of the ccc .",
    "it results that the noise spectrum @xmath118 measured at the output of the squid presents a damped resonance at @xmath119 , much broader than the self - resonance of the bare ccc around 13 khz ( fig.2d ) .",
    "its amplitude is in good agreement with the johnson - nyquist noise emitted by the resistor @xmath120 in the damping circuit and which is reported as the blue dashed line in fig.2d ( appendix f ) . at frequencies between 0.1 hz and 6 hz ,",
    "the noise level remains low and flat , with an amplitude of @xmath121 higher than the level in the bare ccc , indicating however that some external extra noise ( @xmath112 ) couples to the measurement circuit .",
    "below 0.1 hz , excess noise corresponding to a typical @xmath122 frequency dependence of the power spectral density @xmath123 was observed .",
    "the noise @xmath118 manifests itself in the current measurement by a relative standard uncertainty @xmath124 ( type a evaluation ) that can be evaluated by a statistical analysis of series of observations ( annexe b ) .",
    "the other significant contributions to the relative uncertainty of the pqcg , that are evaluated by non - statistical methods ( type b evaluation ) , comes from the cable correction ( @xmath125 ) and the current divider calibration ( @xmath126 ) since components coming from frequency , qhrs , ccc , electronic feedback , and current leakage are negligible .",
    "these contributions result in a relative standard uncertainty @xmath127 ( appendix g ) . in our experiments , it varies from only @xmath128 ( when the current divider is not used ) up to @xmath129 ( for @xmath130 ) .",
    "the combined standard uncertainty of @xmath93 can then be calculated from @xmath131 .",
    "fig.2e reports on series of on - off switchings of the current @xmath93 at @xmath132 amplitude , as recorded by a digital ammeter .",
    "the current value was obtained for @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "this figure demonstrates the capability of the pqcg to generate large currents , _",
    "i.e. _ in the milliampere range .",
    "it also reveals the low - noise level and the stability of the pqcg , notably characterized by the absence of squid unlocking at on - off switchings of the current .",
    "the accuracy of the pqcg is determined by measuring the generated current @xmath93 and then comparing this measurement to its expected expression @xmath137 .",
    "experimentally , the current @xmath93 generated by the pqcg , operated with pjvs#a ( appendix c.1 ) is determined by measuring the voltage difference @xmath138 ( using a em n31 nanovoltmeter ) between the voltage drop at the terminals of a very stable @xmath139 resistance standard @xmath140 , calibrated in terms of @xmath43 with an uncertainty of @xmath141 , and the reference voltage @xmath142 of a second pjvs ( pjvs#ref)(appendix c.1 ) , linked to @xmath42 , and operated synchronously at the same frequency @xmath2 ( fig.3a ) . for experimental convenience ,",
    "the frequencies of both pjvs were kept constant while the voltage balance on the null detector has been done by selecting appropriate number of josephson junctions for both pjvs and by fine tuning the ccc gain @xmath106 .",
    "then , the experimental procedure consists in finding the fraction @xmath143 corresponding to equilibrium , _ i.e. _ for @xmath144 .",
    "this means that @xmath93 is measured through an identification with the reference quantized current , @xmath145 , itself perfectly known in terms of @xmath146 .",
    "the accuracy of the pqcg is then expressed by the relative deviation @xmath147 between the measured current @xmath93 ( = @xmath145 ) and the current @xmath148 calculated from @xmath143 . in practice , @xmath143 is determined from the successive measurements of two small voltages @xmath149 and @xmath150 , obtained for two settings @xmath151 and @xmath152 chosen above and below @xmath143 respectively , and the linear relationship @xmath153 ( appendix h ) .",
    "moreover , series of on - off - on cycles illustrated in fig.3b are used to subtract voltage offsets and truncate the 1/_f _ noise of the ccc at the repetition frequency @xmath154 of the cycles .",
    "the noise of the measurements is analyzed with the help of the allan deviation@xcite ( appendix i ) , which allows to distinguish between the different types of noise according to the exponent of its power dependence with time .",
    "the efficiency of the 1/_f _ noise rejection procedure is demonstrated by fig.3c which reports the typical time dependence of the relative allan deviation of the voltage @xmath155 ( or equivalently of the current @xmath156 ) .",
    "the @xmath157 behavior is typical of a white noise regime and legitimates the calculation of experimental standard deviation of the mean for the 11-cycles time series ( 792 s duration ) to evaluate the standard uncertainties ( type a evaluation ) @xmath158 and @xmath159 , of @xmath149 and @xmath150 respectively .",
    "these uncertainties , of no more than about @xmath160 of @xmath161 for @xmath162 , are then combined with @xmath163 and @xmath164 ( evaluated by type b methods ) to determine the standard uncertainty @xmath165 of @xmath143 ( appendix h ) .",
    "the latter is the main contribution to the measurement uncertainty of @xmath166 ( appendix j ) .",
    "a @xmath0 uncertainty is typically achievable for @xmath167 and an experiment duration of 1600 s.    fig.3d shows the relative deviation @xmath166 as a function of the number @xmath168 of biased josephson junctions at four different amplitudes of @xmath93 in the ma range .",
    "note that maintaining the output current for different @xmath29 requires varying the number of turns @xmath92 in order to keep the ratio @xmath169 constant .",
    "each reported data represents the arithmetic mean value of measurements carried out at different moments .",
    "the data show no significant deviation within combined ( including type a and type b uncertainty contributions ) relative standard uncertainties ( 1 s.d . ) of less than @xmath170 in relative value whatever the value of @xmath29 , except for @xmath171 and @xmath93 at @xmath172 .    indeed , for values of @xmath173 , _",
    "i.e. _ a current @xmath174 , one observes an increased dispersion of the experimental data for @xmath93 with significant deviations from theoretical values .",
    "these deviations are not clearly understood at the present time .",
    "the usual individual quantization tests of both pjvs#a and pjvs#ref and of the qhrs have confirmed that these deviations were not caused by a lack of voltage quantization of the voltage steps nor of the quantum hall resistance plateau .",
    "nevertheless , the discrepancies increased with time and were sensitive to room temperature cycling of pjvs#a .",
    "an alteration of the perfect equipotentiality in the superconducting pads of pjvs#a caused by the circulation of the @xmath65 current might be considered but will need further investigations .    for @xmath175 , such accuracy deterioration",
    "have also been observed occasionally after a long period of operation ( several hours or a day ) , the phenomenon being less pronounced and more rare at low @xmath29 .",
    "however , the quantization of the current @xmath93 was always fully restored by a room temperature cycling of pjvs#a , the josephson array through which @xmath65 circulates .",
    "to illustrate the time reproducibility of the current quantization at low @xmath29 after a cycling , fig.3e reports successive measurements of @xmath166 , here carried out over four hours .",
    "all results are close to zero within a relative uncertainty of @xmath0 for @xmath93 at @xmath176ma and @xmath177 ( @xmath134 ) .",

    "i.e. _ the current used to bias the junctions of pjvs#a , over @xmath179 from the voltage step center at 2.2 ma .",
    "this property is a necessary quantization criterion .    following these considerations ,",
    "fig.1d was elaborated by averaging , for each output current value , the data reported in fig.3d obtained at different @xmath175 . for each current value from @xmath56 to @xmath57 , no significant relative deviation @xmath166 is observed considering the combined measurement uncertainty of @xmath180 ( 1 s.d . ) .",
    "moreover , the experimental standard deviation of all data points over the whole range amounts only to @xmath181 . finally , the weighted mean of @xmath166 is equal to @xmath182 .",
    "these results demonstrate the quantization accuracy of the pqcg in terms of @xmath58 , within a @xmath0 relative uncertainty in the ma range .    the current value @xmath93 results not only from the @xmath65 value but also from the amplification gain @xmath183 which is highly - accurate and can span two orders of magnitude above or below the unity gain ( @xmath92 is between 1 and 4130 , @xmath89 is fixed ) . therefore , @xmath93 is quantized with the same accuracy over the wide range of current values accessible by changing @xmath52 , while @xmath65 remains below @xmath184 , _",

    "error bars are standard uncertainties ( 1 s.d.).,width=275 ]    these high - accuracy measurements have validated the pqcg as a quantum current standard . however it remains important to demonstrate that the pqcg , once checked using quick quantization criteria , can be used to calibrate a commercial digital ammeter ( da ) over several current ranges .",
    "this has been realized by replacing the load in fig.2a by a precision da ( a hp3458a multimeter - appendix k ) with the low potential input connected to ground .",
    "connecting the da directly to the output of the pqcg is an extra challenge due to the sensitivity of quantum devices ( in particular the squid ) to the environmental noise .",
    "it has been possible at the expense of shunting the differential input by a 100 nf highly - insulated polytetrafluoroethylene ( ptfe ) capacitance that short - circuits some digital noise generated by the da .",
    "prior to the calibration , the adjustment procedure recommended by the manufacturer has been followed .",
    "we have then performed current measurements in the da ranges from 10 ma down to @xmath49 by changing the gain @xmath52 ( @xmath190128 and @xmath92 spanning from 1 to 4130 ) while using the highest number of josephson junctions possible when @xmath29 had to be reduced below 3072 , in order to optimize the signal to noise ratio .",
    "two quantization criteria have been identified .",
    "the first one is the independence of the output current as a function of the current biasing the josephson array .",
    "fig.4a shows three quantized current steps which are flat within a few @xmath48 at @xmath191 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "these currents steps were obtained by varying the bias current of josephson array segments of pjvs#b ( appendix c.1 ) containing 3072 , 1024 and 512 josephson junctions respectively .",
    "note that the operating current margins are the same as those of the corresponding voltage steps .",
    "the second quantization criterion is the independence of the calibration results obtained with different values of @xmath29 for the same output current .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.4b that reports the relative deviation , obtained from eight on - off - on cycles over about 15 minutes , between the measured current @xmath188 and the quantized current @xmath194 ( see appendix k for calculation of @xmath93 values ) . in",
    "the 1 ma range , the same currents @xmath93 have been generated by biasing both @xmath29 ( @xmath135 ) and @xmath189 ( @xmath195 ) josephson junctions .",
    "the relative deviations are in agreement within the measurement uncertainties ( see appendix k ) which confirms that the current generated by the pqcg is independent of the value of @xmath65 , provided that it is lower than @xmath184 ( @xmath175 ) .",
    "the lowest uncertainty measurements of fig.4b show that the da is accurate and linear within a relative uncertainty of @xmath196 , which is better than the manufacturer specifications ( see appendix k ) .",
    "the same measurements were performed on the @xmath49 range .",
    "the results show a significant deviation from @xmath93 of about @xmath197 and a higher dispersion of the data points which are due to the accuracy limitation and bigger instability in this range , as can be deduced from the manufacturer specifications .",
    "it is important to note that however a relative uncertainty of @xmath198 is achieved for measurements at the top of both ranges presented in fig.4b and 4c .",
    "note that this is the case for all ranges studied in this paper as it is demonstrated in fig.4d , which reports the relative uncertainties of the measurements performed with @xmath167 and by varying @xmath92 from 1 up to 4130 .",
    "fig.4d shows that the current noise of the pqcg is independent of @xmath92 and that the measurements uncertainty is dominated by the noise of the da ( red data points ) ( appendix k ) .",
    "this could be expected from the da specifications and the low - noise of the pqcg demonstrated in section iii ( about @xmath0 uncertainty for similar measurement time and @xmath29 value ) .",
    "more surprisingly , for @xmath199 , the pqcg noise appears overcoming the one of the da in the 1 ma range since dividing @xmath29 by a factor of two for a given current value , doubles the measurement uncertainties ( a few @xmath50 ) reported in fig.4b .",
    "this is not the case in the @xmath200a range while decreasing @xmath29 by a factor of ten ( fig.4c ) .",
    "this can be explained by the noise spectrum of the pqcg ( fig .",
    "2d . ) and the bandwidth of the measurements which depends on the current ranges , due to the presence of the 100 nf capacitance forming a low - pass filter with the input resistance of the da , with cutoff frequency decreasing at lower - current ranges ( appendix k ) .",
    "this filter prevents the medium - frequency noise from the damping circuit to overcome the noise of the da for the low - current ranges . hence , to fully benefit from the low - noise at low frequencies of the pqcg ( as demonstrated in the pqcg accuracy measurements ) when calibrating the da in all current ranges , improvements of the filtering will be carried on in the future .",
    "simultaneously , cooling down the damping resistor @xmath120 responsible for the johnson - nyquist noise will decrease significantly the pqcg noise at medium frequencies and will also be implemented in the future .",
    "returning towards ohm s law , which is the basis for the definition of the resistance unit , we developed a quantum current standard from the quantum josephson voltage and hall resistance standards that are combined in an original quantum circuit , with the aim of universality , accuracy and simplicity@xcite .",
    "the programmable quantum current generator ( pqcg ) reported here , is able to generate currents from @xmath49 up to 5 ma values , that are quantized in terms of @xmath201 with a @xmath0 relative standard uncertainty .",
    "this universal and versatile quantum current standard improves the accuracy of the current sources of two orders of magnitude compared to cmcs .",
    "it opens the way to a renewed metrology of the electrical current , that will also rely on the development of more stable current transfer standards . as a first proof of its impact",
    ", we showed that the pqcg , after identifying quantization criteria , can be used to calibrate efficiently a digital ammeter with measurement uncertainties only limited by the device under test .",
    "many improvements and extensions of the pqcg can be further considered .",
    "first , one can expect a noise reduction , typically by a factor of ten , by increasing the number of ampere.turns in the ccc , which can be achieved by a larger number of turns @xmath89 of the detection windings ( up to 1600 ) and also by a higher current @xmath65 ( for example , by increasing @xmath29 values while preserving the accuracy ) . in any case , the damping circuit of the ccc resonances should be adapted and refined . in this work , the multiple connection of the qhrs was successfully implemented using different cable configurations ( appendix d ) , thanks to a correct evaluation of the cable correction in the pqcg expression .",
    "nevertheless , the implementation of a complete triple connection of the qhrs will make the cable correction negligible and therefore simplify further the pqcg use . from all these improvements , the target uncertainty of @xmath41",
    "should be reached . beyond",
    ", the availability of graphene - based quantum resistance standards operating in relaxed experimental conditions@xcite should allow the implementation of the quantum voltage , resistance and current standards , as well as their combination , in a unique compact cryogen - free setup .",
    "this would constitute a major step towards the realization of a universal and practical quantum generator / multimeter .",
    "more generally , the principle of using the pqcs as a reference for building the pqcg is seminal and can be exploited for other experiments or instruments@xcite .",
    "for instance , a quantum current generator working in the ac regime can be developed using pulse - driven josephson standards@xcite , ac qhrs@xcite and current transformers@xcite .",
    "this is a perspective that can not be considered with single - electron sources in the present state - of - the - art .",
    "very accurate and sensitive comparisons of quantum hall resistances can be performed by opposing , by means of the ccc , the pqcs currents obtained from two different qhrs polarized by the same josephson voltage reference .",
    "this novel comparison technique could be used to test the universality of the qhe from the integer to the fractional regime .",
    "finally , a quantum ammeter@xcite can be realized by directly comparing the current delivered by an external source to the pqcs using the ccc .",
    "more fundamentally , the pqcg can implement the planned new definition of the ampere with the target uncertainty of @xmath0 since it is linked to the elementary charge _",
    "e_. our work therefore provides an essential piece to the revised si founded on constants of physics .",
    "this achievement will rely on the adoption of the fundamental relationships for the quantum hall and josephson effects in the future si , which is also necessary for the realization of the kilogram from the planck constant _ h _ using the watt balance experiment@xcite .",
    "indeed , it relies on comparing the mechanical power with the electrical power , calibrated itself from the quantum voltage and resistance standards . in this context",
    ", the closure of the metrological triangle@xcite which consists in comparing the ampere realizations in terms of both @xmath201 and @xmath202 , is an important and long awaited experiment .",
    "it indeed leads to the direct measurement of the product @xmath203 , theoretically equal to 2 . validating this equality with a measurement uncertainty down to @xmath0 , would strengthen the confidence in the description , in terms of _ h _ and _ e _ only , of the constants involved in the three solid - state quantum physics phenomena . in this perspective , the pqcg used as a reference and the quantum ammeter built on the pqcs , could be used to accurately measure set - based current sources@xcite in terms of @xmath204 , in a more direct way than in previous experiments@xcite .",
