    "although it is defined as a classical system , the two - dimensional one - component plasma in the case that the surface is of constant curvature is also known in quantum many body physics .",
    "this is due to its relevance to the fractional quantum hall effect .",
    "thus it turns out that the boltzmann factor for the plasma system at inverse temperature @xmath4 , @xmath5 an odd integer , is equal to the absolute value squared of the laughlin trial wave function for the fractional quantum hall effect at filling fraction @xmath6 @xcite . in the case @xmath7 and thus @xmath0 the corresponding trial wave function is in fact the exact wave function for non - interacting spinless fermions with constant perpendicular magnetic field .",

    "the eigenvalues are to leading order still confined to a disk in this radius ( an example of the circular law @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , an analogy between two other random matrix ensembles and the one - component plasma confined to the other homogeneous constant curvature two - dimensional surfaces  namely the sphere and pseudosphere  has been specified .",
    "thus in @xcite it was shown that the eigenvalue pdf for random matrices @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are independent complex ginibre matrices , coincides with the boltzmann factor for the one - component plasma at @xmath0 on the sphere , after a stereographic projection of the latter . and",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the eigenvalue pdf of truncations of unitary random matrices @xcite has the same form as the boltzmann factor for the one - component plasma on the pseudosphere at @xmath0 , after projection of the latter onto the poincar disk .",
