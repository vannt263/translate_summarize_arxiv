    "bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) are formed when a dilute gas of trapped bosons ( of the same species ) is cooled down to ultra - low temperatures close to absolute zero @xcite . in this case , nearly all bosons are in the same quantum mechanical state , which means that they loose their identity and become indistinguishable from each other .",

    "eigenfunctions whose energies are larger than the minimum energy are called excited states of the bec and are not stable in general but may satisfy relaxed concepts of stability such as metastability ( see @xcite ) .",
