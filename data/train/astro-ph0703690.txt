    "qsos appear to be signposts to galaxy evolution .",
    "supermassive black holes have been discovered in nearby galaxies , with masses @xmath7tightly related to host - galaxy bulge properties , e.g. , the stellar velocity dispersion ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and luminosity ( * ? ? ? * & references therein ) .",
    "there is little doubt that these are the black - hole relics of the luminous qsos in their heyday at redshifts @xmath83 .",
    "it is likely that qsos and their hosts evolve symbiotically .",
    "the host supplies fuel to an accreting black hole , perhaps through merger - driven star formation . to enable fuel to feed the disk ,",
    "the central system must lose angular momentum , with this loss possibly via winds seen in emission @xcite and absorption or as more collimated jets .",
    "fundamental parameters of the central engine are bolometric luminosity @xmath9  ( @xmath10 @xmath11 ) representing the fueling rate and efficiency , black hole mass @xmath7 , and eddington accretion ratio @xmath12 , also angular momentum of the black hole .",
    "observationally , there are many trends and potential clues to the nature of this central engine , from the radio to x - ray , from spectral energy distributions , and lines in emission and absorption . while any understanding is incomplete without including the entire observational domain ,",
    "here we are concerned with qsos uv - optical continua and emission lines .",
    "much of the diversity in qso uv - optical spectra can be accounted for by two strong empirical relationships apparently related to fundamental parameters of the central engine : boroson & green s eigenvector 1 relationship ( bgev1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bg92 ) and the baldwin effect ( be ) .",
    "the original be shows an anticorrelation between civ  equivalent width ( ew ) and uv luminosity @xcite .",
    "it was later confirmed that many other uv lines show similar relationships ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which may depend on the ionization potentials of the corresponding ions @xcite .",
    "bgev1 is the first ( i.e. , most significant ) eigenvector discovered from a principal component analysis ( pca ) of measured quasar emission properties in the @xmath5  region @xcite .",
    "pca is a multivariate analysis .",
    "it defines new eigenvectors , which are linear combinations of input observables and can reveal important relationships of the observables ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed description ) .",
    "the original eigenvector 1 relationship found in the @xmath5  region is characterized by the strong anticorrelation between [ oiii ]  and feii  strengths , and involves other parameters such as @xmath5  fwhm and asymmetry ( bg92 ) .",
    "bg92 suggested this set of relationships was driven by @xmath12 .",
    "this was further supported by @xcite , additionally finding that narrower @xmath5 , stronger feii , and weaker [ oiii ]  corresponds to steeper soft x - ray spectra .    in an attempt to understand the above relationships",
    ", we obtained quasi - simultaneous uv - optical spectra over the entire @xmath2@xmath3  range for 22 of the 23 quasars of the bright quasar survey investigated for soft x - ray properties by @xcite ( see  [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "we extended the spectra to the uv and showed , by principal components analysis , the important extension of bgev1 into the ultraviolet , as well as demonstrating that bg s luminosity - dependent eigenvector was actually directly related to the baldwin effect in the uv @xcite .",
    "@xcite carried out a spectral principal components analysis ( spca ) of the same sample .",
    "spca decomposes the input spectra into fewer significant orthogonal ( i.e. , independent ) principal eigenvectors ( or eigenspectra ) , which reveal important relationships among the spectral features ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the first principal eigenvector in @xcite represents the be , and nicely links the equivalent widths of many ultraviolet lines with the optical , including the broad heii@xmath44686  line , whose inverse luminosity dependence was directly demonstrated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the second principal component was the result of differences in continuum shape .",
    "the third principal component extends bgev1 to the uv , showing correlations among broad line widths , and strengths .",
    "these first three principal components accounted for 78% of intrinsic variance among spectra in the sample , demonstrating that these relationships are so clear and obvious , that only a small sample is needed to reveal them .",
    "the technique of spca has the distinct advantage that correlations among emission and absorption lines can be seen independently of having to define a continuum for these blended features , or to measure specific line - profile parameters .",
    "results over the entire wavelength range are immediately visible , revealing correlations that may not otherwise have been sought . however , disadvantages of spca are that the only directly interpretable relationships are those that can be represented by linear relations among the many flux bins along the spectrum .",
    "non - linear dependences caused by differences in line widths , asymmetries , and shifts , or non - linear relationships among emission line ews , as would be present in the be over a sufficiently wide luminosity range , are more easily investigated by direct line measurements .    thus we must also investigate relationships among directly measured spectral parameters . here",
    "we provide a detailed description of the data and direct measurements of the continua , and all strong emission lines and features .",
    "we also present the distribution and relationships of emission line profile properties , including line width , velocity shift , and asymmetry .",

    "laor et al . aimed to test models of the optical to x - ray continuum , and photoionization of the regions producing optical emission lines .",

    "note that the incompleteness of the bqs discussed by @xcite does not bias our low - redshift ( @xmath17 ) sample , since the color - related bias only affect objects with redshifts of @xmath18 . for our uv - optical observations ,",
    "the low redshift allows investigation of uv spectra with much reduced contamination from intergalactic absorption lines and the low @xmath19  ensures small corrections for galactic reddening .",

    "both narrow and wide .",
    "the narrow slit ( 1 2 ) was used for best spectral resolution , and to reduce scattered , background sky , and host - galaxy light .",
    "wide slits ( 8  on lcs , 9.1  on es2 ) were used for absolute flux - density calibration (  [ sec : red : opt ] ) . the wavelength resolution with the narrow lcs slit and es2 slit was typically @xmath23  fwhm , but 6.7  for es2 in 1996",
    "may , equivalent to 450 to @xmath21  300 @xmath22(fwhm ) in the @xmath5  to @xmath3region .",
    "the slit orientation was east - west , except in one case where the spectrograph was rotated to avoid a contaminating star .",

    "a set of higher resolution spectra ( @xmath24@xmath22  fwhm ) of the feii(opt ) @xmath5[oiii ]  region were obtained with the same spectrograph and telescope at mcdonald observatory .",
    "these spectra were used here only to determine the redshifts of most of the qsos in our sample with sufficiently strong [ oiii ]  lines (   [ sec : redshift ] ) .",
    "these relatively high - luminosity agns have broad enough intrinsic emission lines that there was no special advantage to using the higher - resolution data for other analyses .",
    "uv _ hst _  spectra were reduced and calibrated through the standard fos pipeline , which is described at http://www.stecf.org/poa/fos/index.html .",
    "the accum mode observations were obtained in a series of 2- or 4-minute integrations .",
    "the resulting light curves for each object were checked for possible pointing problems .",
    "the light curves are usually flat , indicating stable pointing and tracking . occasionally a decline in the light curve indicated a loss of signal , so integrations were scaled to match the ones with the highest flux , which are likely to be correct .",
    "the validity of this is proved later because flux density levels for spectra taken with different gratings agree well in the regions of overlap .",
    "wavelength scales have been calibrated within the fos pipeline , which uses vacuum wavelengths .",
    "post operational _ hst _  archives ( poa ) show that the systematic uncertainty of the wavelength zeropoint for fos / blue spectra is about @xmath25  ( @xmath21230  @xmath22 ) @xcite .",
    "no effort has been made to correct this for this sample .",
    "more information can be found at http://www.stecf.org/poa/fos/      standard packages in iraf were used to reduce the optical data .",
    "obvious cosmic ray features were removed from the images by hand .",
    "after extraction , the spectra were checked again for cosmic ray features that were also removed .    for narrow slit spectra ( 12 ) , variance - weighted (",
    "optimal ) extraction was used to achieve the best s / n ratio with an aperture size of @xmath2110 pixels ( usually the seeing @xmath26 3 pixels fwhm ) . for wide slit spectra ( 8 , for flux calibration ) , boxcar extraction was used and the aperture size is set as long as 26 pixels ( @xmath27 ) to include as much light from the object as possible .",
    "the background regions were defined on both sides of the extraction aperture with a buffer region .",
    "the background was fitted with a low - order polynomial and subtracted during the extraction .",
    "wavelength scales were calibrated using neon and argon lamp spectra .",
    "this wavelength scale was checked against wavelengths of night sky lines .",
    "for some spectra night sky lines were used to apply a zero - point wavelength correction to the wavelength scale .",
    "absolute flux calibration was achieved by using standard star spectra observed on the same night .",
    "differential atmospheric extinction was corrected with extinction files suitable for mcdonald observatory in different seasons ( barker , e. , private communication ) .",
    "as the standards were observed close in airmass to the qsos , extinction was a minor correction .",
    "atmospheric absorption bands include the very strong o@xmath28 @xmath29 ( 7606 ) and @xmath30 ( 6871 ) bands , h@xmath28o @xmath31 band ( @xmath218200 ) and weaker bands between @xmath32 . in order to correct for these ,",
    "we create a correction spectrum for each qso spectrum using a hot star spectrum ( usually a standard star ) obtained on the same night , close in time and airmass .    finally , slit loss for the narrow - slit qso spectra is corrected by scaling them to match the shape and absolute flux - density level of the wide - slit qso spectra , which are assumed to include all the light from the qso .",
    "this is done by creating a ratio spectrum of the wide - slit ( 8) spectrum and the narrow - slit ( 1  or 2 ) spectrum , fitting its continuum with a low - order smooth curve , and using this curve to correct the narrow - slit qso spectrum . in principle , the scaling is different at different wavelengths , but usually it is very close to a constant over the wavelength range ( @xmath33 ) of a single spectrum . for some cases , a slight ( smoothed ) slope has to be applied in order to match the wide - slit spectra .",
    "the slit - loss correction may increase the uncertainty of flux caused by the host - galaxy contamination because the wide - slit spectra collect more host galaxy light than the narrow - slit spectra .",
    "however , all objects in our sample are luminous qsos and their host galaxies are very faint . during the spectral extraction , the background fitting and subtraction have removed most of the host galaxy contribution .",
    "moreover , host galaxies for luminous qsos are usually elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and their contamination to the qso spectra is mostly in the red wavelengths beyond @xmath214000 .",
    "we estimate that the host galaxy contamination in the narrow - slit spectra is usually @xmath34 . after the slit - loss correction ,",
    "the contamination is still @xmath35 in general , and @xmath36 for the worst case ( pg1115 + 407 ) based on the host galaxy photometry @xcite .",
    "finally , this may affect our line measurement of only the @xmath3  region .",
    "the ground - based spectra were transformed to vacuum wavelength scales to be consistent with those from _",
    "uv and optical spectra for each object were then combined in the observed frame .",
    "when the overlap region is large , the spectra were combined with different weights which are reciprocals of their variance calculated for a common clean continuum region within the overlap region .",
    "in general , the flux - densities in the overlapping spectral regions agree within a few percent , often to @xmath25% .",
    "sometimes differences are large - attributable to poor calibration or , more likely , to intrinsic qso variability for non - quasi - simultaneous observations .",
    "so , when combining spectra for each object , we chose , as a reference , a spectrum with the best flux - density calibration based on , for example , observing conditions , agreement among standard star observations on the same night , and consistency of repeated observations and among the well - calibrated spectra in the overlap regions .",
    "this is fairly easy because there are always several spectra for one object and agreement often exists for a few spectra .",
    "all spectra are scaled , if necessary , to match the flux of the reference spectrum , and the scaling factors for individual spectra are listed in table  [ tb : log ] .",
    "for a given object the relative flux - density calibration over the whole wavelength range should be @xmath37% .",
    "considering the good flux density calibration of the reference spectrum for each object , the accuracy of absolute flux density calibration should approach that of the standards defining the system ( @xmath213% over most of the wavelength range , @xcite ) .",
    "host galaxy contamination could add some additional uncertainty for wavelengths longer than 4000  (  [ sec : red : opt ] ) .",
    "after combining spectra , strong geocoronal lines at ( observed frame ) 1215 , 1302 , and 1355  were removed from the spectra . strong interstellar medium ( ism ) absorption lines were identified using their expected wavelengths and removed by hand .",
    "galactic reddening was removed with an empirical mean extinction law @xcite , assuming @xmath38 , a typical value for diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "@xmath39 is obtained from ned ( table  [ tb : sample ] ) based on the dust maps created by @xcite .",
    "we assume that the narrow emission line region in agn is at the systemic redshift .",
    "we note that there are studies reporting blueshifted [ oiii ]  based on the assumption that @xmath5  is at the systemic redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a recent study @xcite , using more reliable lower ionization lines [ oii ] , [ nii ] , and [ sii ]  as the reference , shows that the average blueshift of [ oiii ]  is 40@xmath22 , with 5% of agn having blueshifts larger than 100@xmath22 . for our sample ,",
    "we use [ oiii ]  5006.8  to define the rest frame .    for most objects in our sample",
    ", we have a separate set of higher resolution spectra (  [ sec : obs ] ) that we used to measure [ oiii ]  redshifts .",
    "after subtraction of optical feiiemission blends using the same feii  template and method used by bg92 , the redshift is measured using the [ oiii ]  @xmath45006.8 line ( table  [ tb : sample ] ) .",
    "redshifts for three objects with measurable [ oiii ]  but without the higher resolution spectra , pg1001 + 054 , pg1425 + 267 and pg1512 + 370 , were measured in the same way from the lower resolution spectra .",
    "the measurement uncertainty of redshifts using [ oiii ]  is 0.0002 . for objects with very weak [ oiii ]  emission ( pg1402 + 261 , pg1444 + 407 , and pg1543 + 489 ) , other emission lines , such as @xmath5  and deblended ciii ] ,",
    "were used and a less accurate redshift ( uncertainty @xmath40 ) was assigned .",
    "the spectra are presented on a rest - frame wavelength scale in figure  [ fg : spec ] .",
    "the flux density is in the observed frame .",
    "we use power - law spectral indices to characterize the qso continua . unless noted , the power - law indices we use through this paper are all @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) except for soft x - ray spectral index @xmath20  and soft x - ray to optical spectral index @xmath43 , which are @xmath44  ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "it is easy to convert between @xmath41 and @xmath46 using @xmath47 .",
    "it is customary to measure the uv - optical spectral index by fitting the continuum with a power - law , but in many objects a single power - law can not fit the entire region .",
    "this was noticed before in a similar sample @xcite . in radio - quiet qsos ,",
    "a uv downturn is often seen ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is present in many composite spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* & references therein ) . in the spectra of radio core - dominant qsos , an additional synchrotron component may be present ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "line- and edge - free regions are hard to find in the qso spectra because of the many broad emission lines and blends .",
    "in fact , when @xcite studied the narrow - line ( @xmath48 ) quasar i  zw  1 with high s / n ratio , and high - resolution spectra , weak emission lines and blends ( e.g. , feii ) were found virtually everywhere .",
    "there are essentially no emission - line - free regions in qso spectra .",
    "the continuum windows are only relatively clean regions and can be different from object to object . we therefore choose six common narrow continuum windows where the emission lines appear very weak : 11441157 , 13481358 , 42004230 , 56005648 , 61986215 , and 68206920 .    as a useful measure of the overall continuum slopes",
    "we define a uv - optical spectral index @xmath49  in the range @xmath2112005500  and a red optical spectral index @xmath50  in the range @xmath2155008000by fitting a power - law to a pair of selected continuum windows .",
    "we try to keep the emission features above the fitted power - laws in the corresponding regions .",
    "it seems that the continuum window 56005648  is needed for both power - laws for most objects .",
    "the continuum windows used for each object and the fitted power - law indices are listed in table  [ tb : cont ] and marked in figure  [ fg : spec ] . if the difference between the two spectral indices is less than 0.20 , we consider that a single power - law is a good approximation to the continuum over the whole wavelength range .",
    "six out of 22 objects meet this criterion ( see table  [ tb : index ] ) .",
    "this can also be visually checked in figure  [ fg : spec ] .",
    "we have also obtained the measurements in the soft x - ray region for this sample @xcite and calculated the optical to soft x - ray spectral index @xmath43  between 2500  and 2kev .",
    "the 2500  flux is estimated using the fitted power - law continuum .",
    "the @xmath43  is listed in table  [ tb : index ] .",
    "for each of several emission - line regions , we fit simultaneously a local power - law continuum and different emission - line components , using @xmath51 minimization within the iraf package _ specfit _ @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fg : fitline ] shows examples of the fitting in different regions .",
    "we used a narrow and a broad gaussian component to fit each strong , broad emission line .",
    "a velocity shift is allowed between the two components to account for the asymmetry of the line profile . for @xmath3  and @xmath5 ,",
    "we have also included a third gaussian component to account for the obvious nlr emission on top of the broad - line profile for several objects . for weak or narrow emission lines ,",
    "one gaussian component is used in the fitting .",
    "we used symmetric gaussian profiles , so each profile has three parameters : flux , width , and central wavelength . in order to avoid too many free parameters , for each emission - line region we assume the same width for similar components of different lines ,",
    "tie together the wavelengths of some lines based on their laboratory wavelengths , and assume line intensity ratios for some lines based on their statistical weights .",
    "we list in table  [ tb : fitpar ] all the free and dependent parameters in each region and how the parameters are related .",
    "for example , in the @xmath5  region , [ oiii]@xmath44959 has the same width and 1/3 of the flux of [ oiii]@xmath45007 ; its wavelength is tied to that of [ oiii]@xmath45007 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we have included fe  templates to account for the complicated feemission only in the optical @xmath5  region and uv mgii  regions .",
    "both the optical feii  template @xcite and the uv fe  template @xcite were derived from the spectra of the narrow - line quasar i  zw  1 .",
    "these templates were allowed to vary in both intensity and broadening to match the fe  emission in different objects , and they are fitted simultaneously with the local power - law continuum and emission - line components in _ specfit_. in doing so , we assume that the fe  emission is above a power - law continuum , same assumption as these templates were derived .",
    "iron can also be important in and near the red wing of civ  and introduces uncertainty in the related measurements for civ .",
    "we discuss this in  [ sec : measure : error ] .",
    "figure  [ fg : fitline ] shows examples of our fitting results and individual components in each region .",
    "we also show our treatment of broad absorption lines or deep absorption features , in the lower right of the figure .",
    "there is obvious strong absorption of @xmath2 , civ , or siiv  in three objects ( pg1001 + 054 , pg1114 + 445 , pg1411 + 442 ) .",
    "we attempted to fit the affected regions in two ways .",
    "first , we excluded the absorbed regions before fitting ; second , we fit the region , including additional absorption gaussian profiles at the absorption positions .",
    "the two methods give consistent results and we use the results from the first method in the following analyses .",
    "our fitting process separates the blended lines , but with possible large uncertainties because of uncertainties in continuum fitting and our assumptions about the relationships between different lines ( table  [ tb : fitpar ] ) , e.g. , same width for two lines .",
    "this affects the weak lines the most and their fluxes are less reliable .",
    "they are used only to understand and remove their contribution on the strong lines . even for some strong lines , although we define different emission lines in the region , we can not really deblend them without arbitrary assumptions . therefore , we present some measurements of just the total blend , such as siiv+oiv]@xmath41400  and nai+hei@xmath45876 .    for all individual broad lines",
    "other than @xmath5  and @xmath3 , we use two gaussian profiles at most and do not include an nlr component .",
    "this sometimes can not fit the narrow peak for some lines .",
    "these peaks could indicate an nlr component , but without other supporting evidence , we can not identify or separate them from the broad components .",
    "in fact , the lack of a @xmath5  nlr - like ( or [ oiii]-like ) peak for civ  has led to a commonly accepted view that the nlr component of civ  is very weak , if not absent ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , although some studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) claim a relatively strong civ  nlr component by allowing a fitted component generally much broader than [ oiii ] .",
    "whether those residual peaks in our fitting are a nlr component or not , they contribute very little to the total flux of the strong emission lines .",
    "the fwhm might have been overestimated a little if there is a residual peak but no real nlr emission , but the uncertainty is still within the error of the measurements (  [ sec : measure : error ] ) .",
    "our overall fit for each region is acceptable in terms of deblending and obtaining profile parameters of strong emission lines .",
    "these fits can be assessed by inspection of figure  [ fg : fitline ] .",
    "emission - line flux , ew and profile parameters are derived from the fitting results . for an emission line with a single gaussian profile ,",
    "the calculations are straightforward . for a strong broad emission line with two gaussian profiles in the fitting",
    ", we add the two profiles and local continuum to form a model spectrum of the emission line region ( excluding an nlr component ) and then derive the parameters from the resulting model .",
    "ew is calculated using the line flux and the fitted local continuum at the emission line wavelength and then transformed to the rest - frame .",
    "all the line velocity shifts are for the peak of the model line profile and relative to the systemic redshift .",
    "fwhm and asymmetry are also derived from the emission line model .",
    "we define a line asymmetry parameter @xcite , @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the wavelength centers of cuts at @xmath55 and @xmath56 of the line peak flux density .",
    "a positive value indicates excess light in the blue wing of an emission line .",

    "sec : measure : error ] .",
    "agn uv - optical continuum spectra usually show a bump between 2000  and 4000 .",
    "this is referred as the `` small blue bump '' ( sbb ) and consists mainly of unresolved fe  blends and balmer continuum .",
    "although we include the fe  template in fitting the mgii  region , the uv fe  emission estimated is not complete due to the cutoff of the template at @xmath213000 .",
    "about 1/3 of the sbb above 3000  is missing in the template , and the local continuum for mgii  can also be affected in the fitting .",
    "we therefore attempt to measure the sbb directly by integrating the spectrum between 2220 and 4010  above a continuum and then subtracting the contribution of mgii  using its fitting results .",
    "we have tried different continua .",
    "the first one is the global uv - optical continuum defined by @xmath49 , but it is likely the sbb flux is overestimated ( fig .",
    "[ fg : fitsbb ] ) because the continuum is defined over a wider wavelength range .",
    "we then define a local power - law continuum by connecting the spectrum between 2220 and 4010 .",
    "in many cases , this underestimates the sbb .",
