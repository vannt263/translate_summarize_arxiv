    "this condition is crucial to obtain the uniqueness of the classical rbsdes .    following those pioneering works ,",
    "many authors have tried to relax the assumptions on the driver of the rbsde and the corresponding obstacle .",

    "@xcite introduced the notion of second order bsdes ( 2bsdes ) , which are connected to the larger class of fully nonlinear pdes .",
    "then soner , touzi and zhang @xcite provided a complete theory of existence and uniqueness for 2bsdes under uniform lipschitz conditions similar to those of pardoux and peng .",

    "our aim in this paper is to provide a complete theory of existence and uniqueness of second order rbsdes ( 2rbsdes ) under the lipschitz - type hypotheses of @xcite on the driver .",
    "we will show that in this context , the definition of a 2rbsde with a lower obstacle @xmath12 is very similar to that of a 2bsde .",
    "we do not need to add another nondecreasing process , unlike in the classical case , and we do not need to impose a condition similar to the skorohod condition .",
