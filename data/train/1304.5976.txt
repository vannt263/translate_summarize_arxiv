    "other crucial lib components include passivating `` solid electrolyte interphase '' ( sei ) films formed from excess electron - induced electrolyte decomposition products on anode surfaces.@xcite sei films are heterogeneous in structure and consist of li@xmath0co@xmath1 , ethylene dicarbonate ( edc ) , oligomeric / polymeric compounds , salt decomposition fragments , and other products.@xcite they prevent continuous electron injection into the electrolyte , averting further loss of li@xmath2 and electrolyte molecules .",
    "li@xmath2 transport through sei films remains adequately fast .",
    "oxidation products are also often found on cathode surfaces .",
    "new concepts of electrodes being pursued , such as si - based anodes and `` air '' cathodes in metal - air batteries , share many solid - liquid interface features shown in fig .",
    "libs are pragmatic devices .",
    "they combine our best electrochemical , solid , and liquid state expertise to deliver high volumetric and gravimetric energy / power densities .",
    "while all - solid batteries have received much attention for niche applications and all - liquid flow - cell batteries have significant potential for static storage , batteries featuring both liquid and solid components will undoubtedly dominate for the foreseeable future .",
    "it has been widely acknowledged that interfaces are critical for good performance and long lifetime in batteries.@xcite to some extent , interfaces dictate the choice of electrode materials and electrolytes .",
    "graphitic anode forms stable sei with ethylene carbonate ( ec ) , not propylene carbonate.@xcite another celebrated example of the interconnected nature of lib degradation concerns spinel lithium manganese oxide cathodes .",
    "mn(ii ) ions dissolve from the spinel@xcite and diffuse to the anode .",
    "they are incorporated into the sei there and degrade its passivation properties via mechanisms not yet fully understood , leading to enhanced reductive decomposition of the electrolyte.@xcite thus solid and liquid degradation modes can be strongly coupled .",
    "the choice of carbon materials also strongly influences their viability as anodes.@xcite this is possibly related to interfacial effects such as instability towards exfoliation of graphite induced by solvent intercalation@xcite and carbon - edge functional groups .",
    "molecular additives like vinylene carbonate ( vc ) have been added to improve electrode passivation,@xcite and these can react on both cathode and anode surfaces.@xcite interfaces are particularly pertinent to nanostructured electrodes for energy storage applications where the large surface areas call for enhanced stabilization.@xcite if adequate control of interfaces can be attained , nanostructures have the potential of achieving much higher electron and lithium ion transport rates , and alleviating strain - induced electrode cracking and degradation .",
    "to some extent , theory and experiments used to study lib liquid - solid interfaces are complementary .",

    "modeling reactions involve predicting electron transfer and chemical changes and typically relies on density functional theory ( dft ) based techniques .",
    "such calculations probe smaller length and time scales than experiments , and can reveal insights about thermodynamics and kinetics which are difficult to measure under the non - equilibrium , kinetically - driven sei formation conditions .",

    "s cluster - based work@xcite ( see ref .   for a theoretical overview ) . with the continual growth of computational power",
    ", the admittedly costly dft - based _ ab initio _ molecular dynamic method ( aimd , discussed below ) will be a mainstay of future liquid - solid interface studies .",
    "aimd permits inclusion of electrodes and liquid electrolytes in model systems and adds multi - electron reactions , reactive surface sites , and new perspectives to balbuena _",
    "s work . other interfacial phenomena , like the dynamics of li@xmath2 intercalation between electrolyte and electrodes , are important but arguably must await elucidation of how electrode surfaces are modified by electrolyte decomposition products , unless the electrode operates at sufficiently modest voltages to keep its surfaces pristine.@xcite    batteries are complex systems . the applied voltage , state - of - charge ( lithium content ) , temperature , electrode cracking , sweep rate , presence of conductive carbon materials , native surface films like lithium carbonates on cathodes , and interference from salts / contaminants all affect interfacial behavior .",
    "they are challenging to model even on bare oxide surfaces ( i.e. , in vacuum).@xcite we have adopted a basic science approach .",
    "our starting points are defect - free surfaces that can be probed using aimd methods at finite temperature .",
    "far from being routine dft / aimd applications , we will show that modeling clean battery interfaces already requires going beyond state - of - the - art theoretical capability and is a good example of application - driven fundamental research .",
    "modeling liquid / solid interfaces is intrinsically interdisciplinary .",
    "this review will highlight computational techniques which are trivial to either the solid or liquid state community for the sake of bridging the gap between them .",
    "important modeling studies on bare electrode surfaces have been made on crystal facet effects , surface reconstructions and terminations , non - stoichiometric compositions , and defects.@xcite more effort in this area is needed to elucidate surface structures which are starting points for interfacial studies .",
    "but the electrolyte is undeniably important and has been somewhat neglected . to take an example",
    ", dft - computed energy dffererences for li insertion into bulk cathode materials from li metal have been reported as `` open circuit voltages '' ( ocv),@xcite which appears a misnomer ( `` intrinsic potential '' would be more appropriate ) .",
    "measuring ocv invariably involves immersing an electrode into a liquid electrolyte .",
    "the absolute values of such voltages are modified by net surface charges , interfacial dipoles , and even purely quantum mechanical interfacial effects.@xcite even if interfacial voltage effects are small in magnitude for battery electrodes , they may become crucial for atomic level study of li@xmath2 insertion and sei formation .",
    "we will present other examples where explicit depiction of molecules qualitatively alters our understanding of battery degradation processes .",
    "current theoretical studies on organic solvent - based li - air batteries@xcite have also focused on either the solid@xcite or liquid@xcite state .",
    "modeling reactions at lib electrode / electrolyte interfaces is arguably a fledging , specialized area .",
    "however , it is part of the broader field of computational and theoretical electrochemistry , intimately connected to aqueous interfaces,@xcite notwithstanding the fact that water itself must be excluded from lib .",
    "dft - based computational studies of water - material interfaces pertinent to electrocatalysis,@xcite energy conversion ( water splitting),@xcite geochemistry and mineral dissolution,@xcite and fuel cells@xcite can inform and be informed by lib simulations . our work in fact owes part of its motivation@xcite to water dissociation studies on tio@xmath0 surfaces.@xcite in that example , the interactions of a sub - monolayer of water with different facets of anatase and rutile have been considered in joint dft and experimental studies on clean surfaces under uhv conditions@xcite before aimd studies of water - tio@xmath0 interfaces are conducted  including simulations with anions which may not be stable under unsolvated uhv conditions .",
    "we argue that a similar recipe may benefit fundamental studies on lib .    at the same time , it must be stressed that any frozen ( i.e. , uhv - like geometry optimization at t=0  k ) description of electrolyte molecules is an uncontrolled approximation of liquids , although it can yield very useful insights.@xcite theoretically , one usually claim that @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5 if a low order perturbative expansion between @xmath3 and @xmath5 yields accurate predictions . liquids and crystalline solids are separated by discontinuous first order phase transitions .",
    "elementary calculus dictates that no real perturbative series connect them . in that sense ,",
    "liquids and crystalline solids are not `` similar ; '' they are _ profoundly _ different . as an example , salt solubility drops many orders of magnitude across the freezing point  yet salts are vital to electrochemistry !",
    "solvent oxidation / reduction involves changes in solvent charge states , and the stabilization of these reaction products is related to ionic solubility .",
    "modeling an electrode with a net charge is facilitated by explicit treatment of liquid electrolytes that compensate the charge .",
    "aimd with explicit molecular description of liquids is rigorously suited for modeling salt effects at interfaces , although this remains costly at present .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "[ anode ] and  [ metal ] describe electrolyte decomposition reactions on pristine graphite and lithium metal surfaces at the initial stages of sei formation , respectively .",
    "we observe two - electron induced ethylene carbonate decomposition via breaking two different c - o bonds , instead of the one - electron pathway which has been the focus in the literature .",
    "[ ald ] discusses electrode coated with an insulator , where the long - range electron tunneling rate is found to depend on both the molecular species being reduced and its charge state .",
    "[ cathode ] reviews solvent decomposition modeling on spinel manganese oxide cathode surfaces and suggests that solvent breakdown and mn dissolution may be related .",
    "[ conclusion ] summarizes the article . a supporting information ( s.i . )",
    "document is included to discuss computational challenges to be overcome and possible new directions of research , including the prediction and control of voltages , electron transfer , and dft accuracy issues . in each section",
    ", we briefly describe the motivations and main predictions at a model lib interface , discuss the significance in some detail , and bring up pertinent computational issues .",
    "lib charging occurs at almost @xmath7  v vs.  standard hydrogen electrode ( almost 0  v vs.  the li@xmath2/l(s ) couple ) with anodes like graphite and silicon .",
    "most electrolyte molecules are electrochemically reduced at such voltages .",
    "on graphitic carbon , if ec ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) is a main component of the electrolyte , stable passivating sei films are formed from electrolyte decomposition products , and they prevent further electron leakage to the electrolyte which causes its continuous breakdown.@xcite this is somewhat analogous to passivation of some metal surfaces by oxide or hydroxide in contact with water .",
    "given its critical importance and ubiquity , it is tempting to call ec the `` new water '' of lithium ion batteries .",
    "experimentally , the battery is assembled without pre - intercalation of li into graphite . during first charge ,",
    "as the voltage is lowered ( effectively putting a negative charge on the anode compensated by cations at the interface ) , sei starts to form . at even lower voltages ,",
    "li@xmath2 begins to insert .",
    "this dynamical process is difficult to simulate partly because the excess charge / voltage relation is difficult to control .",
    "long trajectories are needed to equilibrate and converge even the open circuit voltage drop between the interior of the electrode and the electrolyte region outside the double layer;@xcite such a calculation may be slightly beyond current aimd time scale,@xcite especially for the purpose of equilibrating salt diffusion . modeling an _ applied _ voltage in a completely condensed - phase",
    "setting is even more challenging .",
    "see the s.i .  for a more detailed discussion .    instead",
    ", we have chosen to start with fully lithiated lic@xmath6 with a charge - neutral simulation cell ( apart from a positive charge arising from one li@xmath2 ion in the electrolyte region ) .",
    "while this lic@xmath6 stoichiometry does not truly reflect the experimental conditions during initial charging , it allows us to set the li chemical potential of lic@xmath6 in the solid state anode to the solid state value by approximately matching the energy of the last li atom added to the model electrode , in the absence of electrolytes , with the chemical potential of li in bulk lic@xmath6 . unlike on inert electrodes , the voltage in the anode interior can be tuned by varying li content without inducing a net charge , although the anode surface may still retain a new charge ; the potential of zero charge has not been determined experimentally or theoretically for most intercalation charge - neutral materials .",
    "thus , with this approach , there remains some ambiguity in the voltage due to liquid - solid interfacial effects ( see the s.i . ) . in the next section ,",
    "we show that the electrochemical reactions and products discussed in this section are general ; they are also observed at li metal interfaces , where ( unlike graphite ) one does not have to worry whether the sei forms before li intercalation .",
    "figure  [ fig2]a depicts an aimd snapshot at the initial stages of ec decomposition on graphite pre - intercalated with li.@xcite 32  ec molecules are sandwiched between the anode surfaces .",
    "they are pre - equilibrated using non - reactive classical force fields .",
    "7  ps into the aimd trajectory , two electrons from the electrode have been transferred to each of three ec molecules coordinated to li@xmath2 ions in bulk solution or at the graphite edge .",
    "these `` ec@xmath8 '' species decompose by breaking c@xmath9-o and c@xmath10-o bonds ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) into two sets of products , respectively : @xmath11 consistent with these reactions , significant amount of c@xmath0h@xmath12 and co gases have been detected in gas chromotography measurement during battery charging,@xcite although the precise gas speciation varies with experimental groups.@xcite carbon labeling techniques have shown that ec is a significant source of co.@xcite co@xmath13 is known to be a sei component .",
    "oc@xmath0h@xmath12o@xmath8 is reactive and can form other products , including oligomers which can be further reduced.@xcite    these aimd predictions are significant for the following reasons . in the literature , the slower one - electron , c@xmath9-o bond breaking decomposition route has been much quoted .",
    "it has been invoked to explain most observed sei products from ethylene dicarbonate ( edc , reportedly a major sei component@xcite ) to oligomers.@xcite modeling efforts , including dft cluster calculations@xcite and reactive force - field construction,@xcite have also focused on this 1-e@xmath14 c@xmath9-o cleavage route .",
    "even if 2-@xmath15 processes are discussed , as they should be at the initial stages of sei growth when @xmath15 transfer is fast , most published works refer to mechanisms that involving breaking c@xmath9-o bonds via eq .",
    "[ old2e ] .",
    "co gas release ( eq .  [ eg-2h ] ) , reported in several measurements@xcite and consistent with breaking c@xmath10-o bonds ( fig .  [ fig2]d ) , have arguably been somewhat ignored .",
    "because our model system contains a large electron reservoir and many ec molecules , it supports multiple ec reduction reactions and decomposition products anchored at the electrodes .",
    "our unbiased aimd simulations , which do not dictate _ a prior _ pathways , predict both 2-@xmath15 induced reactions ( eq .  [ old2e ]  and  [ eg-2h ] ) at this out - of - equilibrium , highly driven initial stage of sei formation .",
    "thus c@xmath10-o bond - breaking ( eq .  [ eg-2h ] , fig .",
    "[ fig2]d ) is at least as fast as c@xmath9-o ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ) cleavage .",
    "this has been confirmed in a quantum chemistry cluster - based publication@xcite which also suggests that 1-@xmath15 processes only dominate when the sei thickens and @xmath15 transfer significantly slows down .",
    "a central insight of aimd and aimd - inspired studies is that the c@xmath10-o bond becomes very weak after ec has absorbed one or two electrons .",
    "therefore eq .",
    "[ eg-2h ] needs to be considered when interpreting experiments and in force field constructions .",
    "we believe the 2-@xmath15 , co - gas route is a more logical mechanism to yield edc , reportedly a main sei component , than 1-@xmath15 mechanisms.@xcite    we reiterate that the voltage drop between the model electrode and electrolyte regions is not precisely controlled in these simulations , unlike in experiments .",
    "however , the intrinsic reduction voltage of intact ec@xmath14 has been predicted to be less negative than that of charge neutral ec within the accuracy allowed by the dielectric continuum approximation used therein.@xcite this suggests that the two - electron route and can occur at any applied voltage where ec@xmath14 is formed .",
    "the precise applied voltage may still alter the electron transfer rate via marcus theory and indirectly change the sei product distribution.@xcite    _ computational aspects : _ aimd simulations involve solving , in real time , newton s second law of motion @xmath16 using forces generated by dft . by the ergodic hypothesis , a sufficiently long trajectory visits all pertinent liquid state configurations and allows sufficient sampling of equilibrium properties .",
    "a 10  ps aimd trajectory is at least 10 - 100 times more costly than zero temperature optimization calculations for models of the same size .",
    "but when a finite temperature , explicitly liquid - state , all - molecule description of electrolyte is used , md is the rigorous method .",
    "aimd allows the use of theoretical models with the highest fidelity to experimental conditions to date .",
    "these aimd simulations are based on the approximate dft / pbe functional@xcite which tends to underestimate reaction barriers . despite this",
    ", they suggest that much faster 2-@xmath15 reactions will be observed than previous studies of 1-@xmath15 processes have suggested.@xcite our simulations of ec are conducted at t=450  k. one reason is that ec is a solid at room temperature . in batteries ,",
    "the presence of co - solvents like dmc ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) reduces the melting point and viscosity .",
    "cis_-_trans _ isomerization is currently beyond aimd time scale , but advanced sampling technique may circumvent this problem in the future . in general , aimd may not reproduce the correct temperature scale for liquid state structures and dynamics.@xcite in the celebrated case of liquid water , aimd / pbe simulations at an elevated t=400  k is needed to yield t=300  k experimental water structure.@xcite",
    "ec decomposition products on li metal surfaces and on lic@xmath6 are qualitatively similar , although product compositions and salt effects differ in quantitative ways.@xcite we have also conducted aimd simulations of the liquid ec / li metal ( 100 ) interface ( fig .  [ fig2]b).@xcite here ec reduction reactions are even more violent . within 10  ps , all 12 ec  molecules touching the li metal have reacted .",

    "[ eg-2h ] and one ec has decomposed into co@xmath13 and c@xmath0h@xmath12 ( eq .  [ old2e ] ) . despite the use of a thermostat in the simulation , the heat generated from the reactions has melted the small li model electrode .",
    "one signficance of this study is that the open circuit voltage ( ocv ) should be unambiguously that of li@xmath2/li(s ) .",
    "in contrast , in fig .  [ fig2]a , the voltage is estimated using solid state approximations , neglecting interfacial effects.@xcite computing the ocv remains a major challenge of computational electrochemistry ( see the s.i.),@xcite although perturbative approaches ( e.g. , adding voltage - induced changes in fermi levels for metallic electrodes ) have been successfully applied at t=0  k.@xcite despite this ambiguity associated with the graphite anode , the same sei products are predicted ( fig .",

    "we have also found that increased brillouin sampling in this smaller system does not yield different ec reduction reactions .    finally , the crystalline li metal ( 100 ) surface enables straight - forward uhv condition dft / pbe studies of single molecule ec decomposition . using t=0",

    "the preference for the co - route is attributed to kinematic factors .",
    "neb calculations show that electrochemical ec decomposition mechanisms are predicted to be viable for single ec molecules at low temperature on li(100 ) .",

    "co is absorbed into the li metal , while the end groups of oc@xmath0h@xmath12o@xmath8 are reactive.@xcite future interpretations of xps measurements of ec decomposition may benefit from consideration of c@xmath10-o bond cleavage .",
    "_ computational aspects : _ the neb method , widely used in solid state physics / materials science under uhv conditions , is similar in spirit to transition state calculations performed using the gaussian suite of programs .",
    "the transition state obtained should exhibit only one imaginary frequency along the reaction direction .",
    "unlike solids at t=0  k , liquid state atomic configurations are _ not _ at local minima , and the instantaneous vibrational frequency spectrum computed at any md snapshot contains many imaginary modes.@xcite therefore neb can not be used in the presence of an explicit liquid component ( see sec .  [ cathode ] ) .",

    "the predicted barrier appears readily surmountable in battery operation time scale .",
    "one significance of this work is that it suggests solvent oxidation and electrode degradation may be related .",
    "the oxidized ec molecule fragment has pulled an oxygen ion out of the surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]f ) .",
    "the proton transfer from ec to the oxide is perhaps even more intriguing .",
    "acid has been found to accelerate mn(ii ) dissolution.@xcite acid protons have often been assumed to come from trace water , inevitably present ) reacting with the pf@xmath17 salt .",
    "however , oh and coworkers have reported evidence that protons can come from organic solvent , especially tetrahydrofuran with liclo@xmath12 salt.@xcite our proposed ec oxidation mechanism may take place cooperatively with the trace water route , because h@xmath2 deposited on the oxide surface may create h@xmath0o as mn dissolves .",
    "this work paves the way for future studies of oxidation on spinel ( 111 ) surfaces , which are more prominent than ( 100 ) .",
    "incidentally , the surface reconstruction of the ( 111 ) surface in vacuum has not been published.@xcite for liquid - state experts , this last point emphasizes the difficulty of identifying appropriate starting surfaces to perform liquid - solid interfacial calculations .",
    "finally , as - synthesized limn@xmath0o@xmath12 particles are covered with lithium carbonate and inactive surface oxide phases . for mn ions to dissolve , the carbonate film must first either crack@xcite or dissolve in the electrolyte .",
    "much attention has been paid to mn charge states , especially on bare spinel oxide surfaces.@xcite this is because mn(ii ) dissolution has been proposed to occur via two mn(iii ) disproportionating into mn(ii ) and mn(iv).@xcite however , for an mn ion to dissolve directly from the spinel surface , it must first coordinate to one or more solvent molecules.@xcite we have observed that , when an ec molecule binds to a 5-coordinated surface mn(iii ) on the ( 100 ) surface under uhv conditions , the now 6-coordinated mn(iii ) transforms into a mn(iv ) by donating an electron to a subsurface mn(iv ) .",
    "this seems to render mn charge states on the bare ( 100 ) surface irrelevant , and emphasizes that molecules must be explicitly depicted to understand mn dissolution .    _",
    "computational aspects : _ as discussed in sec .",
    "[ metal ] , neb can not be used to find reaction barriers in the presence of explicit liquid components . instead",
    ", aimd pmf calculations are performed using the umbrella sampling method.@xcite reactive coordinates @xmath31 that continuously link the reactant , transition states , and product are chosen using uhv results as guide .",
    "the free energy change along @xmath31 is proportional to @xmath32@xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the probability that the value @xmath31 occurs in a trajectory after correcting for effects of umbrella constraints ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]a  &  b).@xcite calculating the reaction free energy ( @xmath25 ) , which is path - independent , also benefits from having a continuous @xmath31 path .",
    "an alternative would be to calculate the average enthalpies of the initial and final state and subtracting them .",
    "this alternate approach is plagued by thermal uncertainties which scale as @xmath35 t , where @xmath36 is the number of nuclear degrees of freedom , @xmath37 is the total trajectory length , and @xmath38 is the correlation time .",
    "if the simulation is faithful to experiments and features many liquid molecules ( large @xmath36 ) , the noise can easily be a fraction of an electron volt .",
    "the pmf method circumvents this problem .",
    "we have reviewed our modeling work on lithium ion battery electrode / electrolyte interfacial electrochemical reactions leading to sei formation on anode surfaces and the reactions between electrolytes and spinel lithium manganese oxide cathode surfaces .",
    "aimd simulations are valuable for predicting unbiased , fast , kinetically - determined multiple reaction mechanisms at the initial stages of sei formation . although costly , insights gained using aimd can motivate new research directions which require less computationally intensive methods .",
    "electron tunneling between electrode and electrolyte through an insulating layer will be an important area of research ( see also the s.i . ) .",
    "the explicit depiction of molecules and electrode surfaces is shown to be important for both electron transfer and cathode degradation .",
    "the utility of ultra - high vacuum experiments on clean electrode surfaces covered with sub - monolayers of electrolyte molecules is proposed .",
    "we have also highlighted the synergy between lithium ion battery modeling and theoretical studies of water - material interfaces.@xcite exchange of knowledge between these disciplines will accelerate progress in modeling battery processes where more fundamental modeling studies are necessary .",

    "<S> our goals are to introduce experimentalists to simulation techniques applicable to models which are arguably most faithful to experimental conditions so far , and to emphasize to theorists that the inherently interdisciplinary nature of this subject requires bridging the gap between solid and liquid state perspectives . </S>",
    "<S> we consider liquid ethylene carbonate ( ec ) decomposition on lithium intercalated graphite , lithium metal , oxide - coated graphite , and spinel manganese oxide surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations are put in the context of more widely studied water - solid interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> our main themes include kinetically controlled two - electron - induced reactions , the breaking of a previously much neglected chemical bond in ec , and electron tunneling . future work on modeling batteries at atomic lengthscales requires capabilities beyond state - of - the - art , which emphasizes that applied battery research can and should drive fundamental science development . + keywords : solid electrolyte interphase ; _ ab initio molecular dynamics _ ; lithium manganese oxide ; ethylene carbonate ; electron transfer    epsf </S>"
