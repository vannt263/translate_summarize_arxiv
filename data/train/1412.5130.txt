    "efficient imposition of the solid boundaries on the incompressible navier ",
    "stokes equations has been one of the longstanding challenges of the theoretical as well as computational fluid dynamics .",
    "the effects of the solid boundaries on the fluid flow are commonly modeled by the no - slip condition , which means the velocities of the fluid and solid are equal at the solid boundaries .    in spite of the extensive body of literature on the implementation of the no - slip condition , both for the regular boundaries [ 3 , 5 , 2 ] , and the immersed boundaries [ 6 , 7 ]",
    ", it seems that exact implementation of this condition so that the velocity vector remains solenoidal all over the solution domain is still an unsolved problem .",
    "+ the present article , suggests modification of the incompressible navier ",
    "stokes equations so that the solid rigid bodies can be implemented exactly . by the term rigid we mean a material of infinite elastic modulus .",
    "this is a simplified model which may be used in many fluid ",
    "solid problems , at least approximately . in these materials , by their nature , the distribution of stresses is not a continuous function . in particular ,",
    "the distribution of stresses in the body is not depended on the stresses on the boundaries .",
    "it means the stresses on the boundary of a rigid body , in a fluid  solid system , do not affect the stresses inside the rigid body .",
    "this is a mutual effect , that is , the stresses in the rigid body do not affect the stresses in the fluid as well . in fact , the stresses field in the fluid  solid system are discontinuous at the solid surface . therefore , the rigid body surface is a singularity surface in that the information do not exchange between its two sides .",
    "+ such singularity surfaces are well - known in the general relativity and cosmology .",
    "in fact , the black holes have been in studying for several decades as the singularities in the space ",
    "time structure [ 4 ] .",
    "the black hole surface ( the event horizon , as it is called in the general relativity ) is assumed to be a singularity surface that no information can be exchanged between its two sides .",
    "for the black holes , the singularity is due to infinite curvature in the space ",
    "time manifold which , in turn , is a result of extremely strong gravity of the black hole , which causes an infinite time dilation .",
    "+ now , in a fluid  solid system , if we assume that vanishing of the velocities in the solid body is a result of stopping the time ( i.e. infinite time dilation ) , not the result of properties of the material , then many similarities can be observed between the presence of a black hole in the space  time and the presence of a solid rigid body in an incompressible flow ( except for the gravity of coarse ) .",
    "this is the key assumption we made in our study .",
    "+ in the approach we suggest in the present article , the fluid  solid system is modeled by a fluid flow field having two different time dilations .",
    "the fluid region has no time dilation , while in the solid region the time dilation goes to infinity .",
    "as it will be seen , the presence of the solid body will fully sense by the fluid flow in this way .",
    "+ in the sequel , at first , we re - formulate the incompressible navier ",
    "stokes equations to involve an arbitrary time dilation .",
    "then , suitable time dilation for imposition of the rigid solid bodies is introduced in the equations and the physical and mathematical characteristics of the resulting modified naver ",
    "stokes equations are discussed .",
    "finally , the capability of the modified equations in imposition of the solid bodies is demonstrated via solution of three classical exact solutions of the navier  stokes equations .",
    "the modified navier  stokes equations are derived in this section . beginning from the classical incompressible navier  stokes equations ,",
    "an arbitrary time dilation is imposed on the equations and then a particular time dilation is proposed so that the rigid bodies can be modeled .",
    "the physical and mathematical properties of the modified equations are discussed in the end .     with its boundary @xmath0",
    "is placed in the flow of an incompressible newtonian fluid occupies the flow domain @xmath1 .",
    "the fluid flow is formulated and solved in a regular domain @xmath2 with its boundary @xmath3.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      according to fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] , consider a regular domain @xmath4 where @xmath5 or @xmath6 and its boundary @xmath3 , containing a rigid solid obstacle @xmath7 with its boundary @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , assume that the fluid domain @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 ) , is occupied by an incompressible newtonian fluid that its dynamics is governed by the incompressible navier  stokes equations @xmath10 in which @xmath11^t$ ] is the velocity vector , @xmath12 is the pressure , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the fluid density and the kinematic viscosity .",
    "the initial and boundary conditions for the above system are : @xmath15 where we assume that the initial velocity is solenoidal @xmath16 ; and the initial and boundary data are compatible .    for the future usage , system ( [ e0 ] ) with the initial / boundary conditions ( [ e011])([e02 ] )",
    "is called @xmath17 . at this point",
    "we assume that system @xmath17 has a unique solution , which means there are sufficiently smooth velocity vector filed @xmath18 and pressure field @xmath19 that satisfy equations ( [ e0 ] ) and the boundary conditions ( [ e011])([e02 ] ) .",
    "now , it is desired to re - formulate the incompressible navier  stokes ( without rigid obstacles ) in the presence of an arbitrary local time dilation .",
    "the formulation is provided in the regular domain @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ) .    in the regular domain @xmath4 and its boundary @xmath3 , occupied by a newtonian fluid ,",
    "we consider two distinct inertial space  time coordinates ; that is , a reference space ",
    "time coordinate @xmath20 and a local space ",
    "time coordinate @xmath21 .",
    "merely the time dilation is desired ( without any changes in the space or other ) .",
    "therefore , we assume @xmath22 while @xmath23 where the time dilation factor @xmath24 is given at each reference time instant @xmath25 . the fluid flow is observed by both local and reference observers ; however , the time dilation is recognizable only by the reference observer .",
    "+ since the physical laws are invariant in all inertial coordinates [ 4 ] , the navier  stokes equations ( [ e0 ] ) are valid in the local coordinate @xmath26 , that is @xmath27 with the initial / boundary conditions @xmath28 in these equations @xmath29 are quantities that are observed from the local coordinate . particularly , note that @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the molecular density and viscosity , which assumed to be constant .",
    "moreover , we assume that the initial velocity is solenoidal ( i.e. @xmath32 ) , and the initial and boundary data are compatible .",
    "+ in the next sections , system ( [ e1 ] ) with the initial / boundary conditions ( [ e0111])([e01111 ] ) will be referred as @xmath33 . + * remark 1 : * it should be noted that the only boundary is @xmath3 ( and therefore , the only required boundary condition is on @xmath3 ) ; and the no - slip condition is eliminated for now ( in fact it will be imposed by the forcing terms in the future . )",
    "+ now we can obtain the above equations in the viewpoint of the reference space ",
    "time coordinate @xmath20 . to this end :    * * the velocities * : one can write @xmath34 where @xmath35 is observed from the reference coordinate . * * the pressure and the density * : in the incompressible navier  stokes equations the pressure is not a thermodynamics quantity . therefore , the relation between the local and reference pressures can not be determined uniquely by merely determining the time dilation .",
    "+ in general , one can say @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the material derivative and @xmath38 is a space coordinate .",
    "therefore @xmath39 this is the only restriction that the incompressible navier  stokes equations is enforced . therefore , there are two degrees of freedom ( that is , the relations between the local and reference density and pressure could be determined concurrently ) .",
    "in fact , any @xmath40 and @xmath41 that @xmath42 results in the momentum equations that their two sides are consistent ; and produces a pressure jump in crossing the solid boundary ( which physically is legitimated ) .",
    "+ however , in order to have a model that is as simple as possible , we choose @xmath43 , which means @xmath44 , that is @xmath45 * * the viscosity * : the reynolds number must be an invariant quantity ( it is not physically meaningful looking at a low reynolds number flow and observing turbulence . )",
    "therefore : @xmath46 which means @xmath47 in fact , the viscosity observed by the reference observer ( i.e. @xmath48 ) , is a function of @xmath49 .",
    "on the other hand , substitution from @xmath50 results in @xmath51    using the above assumptions , one can find the navier ",
    "stokes equations in the viewpoint of the reference coordinate @xmath20 ; by substituting @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 in eqns .",

    "the following points are noticeable :    * both the momentum and continuity equation are modified .",
    "in fact , the difference between the modified navier  stokes equations ( [ e7])([e8 ] ) and the original navier  stokes equations ( [ e0 ] ) is the forcing terms @xmath58 and @xmath59 . *",
    "the support of both @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the support of @xmath60 .",
    "in fact , for any constant time dilation factor @xmath61 , both @xmath58 and @xmath59 are vanished , and the original navier  stokes equations are retrieved . in particular",
    "this is in agreement with the general relativity . *",
    "the forcing terms @xmath62 and @xmath63 were obtained for a general @xmath49 ; however , as it will be shown in @xmath64 [ continuity ] , when we impose the rigid surface , finally @xmath65 and the classical continuity equation is retrieved .",
