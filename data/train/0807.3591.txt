    "r - process is considered to be a leading candidate responsible for the synthesis of elements heavier than a@xmath070 @xcite .",
    "since the study of r - process involves many kinds of nuclei which extend to the neutron - rich region , one often has to predict theoretically their masses and beta - decay rates .",
    "although the recent experimental exploration to nuclei close to neutron- ( proton- ) drip line will make the study of r - process more reliable , a part of heavy neutron - rich nuclei produced by r - process are still difficult to examine experimentally . notice that those heavy nuclei have a characteristic decay channel , that is fission .",
    "r - process with fission of heavy neutron - rich nuclei has been discussed and considered to explain the formation of elements with a@xmath0130@xcite .",
    "one of the important quantities which govern the fission process is a fission barrier .",
    "so far , the theoretical study of fission barrier height has been limited to the zero - temperature @xcite .",
    "this is justified if the excitation energy is not so high and the corresponding temperature is much lower than the critical temperature @xmath1 , at which pairing correlations vanish ( the critical temperature may be approximated with @xmath2 @xcite ) .",
    "the pairing gap parameter for heavy nuclei is relatively small .",
    "in addition , heavy neutron - rich nuclei involved in the r - process may have a high excitation energy , leading to the pairing phase transition , as a consequence of the beta - decay or the neutron - capture .",
    "the highly excited state may decay via fission .",
    "the neutron - induced fission has a significant role in the environment of high neutron density , while the beta - delayed fission is important when the neutron density is lower than about @xmath3@xcite .",
    "if the pairing phase transition occurs , the fission probability will be considerably affected .",
    "the aim of this work is to assess the sensitivity of fission barrier height and fission probability of hot neutron - rich nuclei to the temperature .",
    "we study @xmath4u , which is close to the stability line , as well as @xmath5fm , which is neutron - rich nucleus relevant to the r - process .",
    "in this work , we use the finite temperature skyrme - hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( fthfb ) method @xcite with a zero - range pairing force .",
    "the framework is the same as the zero - temperature hfb except for the particle density and pairing tensor .",
    "they are modified according to the fermi - dirac distribution of quasi - particle occupancy .",
    "the thermal averaged particle density and pairing field are given as , @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the quasi - particle occupation probability defined by @xmath9 , @xmath10 being @xmath11 .",
    "we have assumed the volume - type pairing interaction , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 corresponds to proton and @xmath14 neutron . @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the quasi - particle wave functions , which are the solution of the fthfb equation given by , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the thermal averaged mean field hamiltonian and pairing field , respectively , and @xmath20 is the quasi - particle energy .    in this work ,",
    "we use the quadrupole operator @xmath21 as a constraining operator . for simplicity",
    ", we assume the reflection and axially symmetric nuclear shapes .",
    "deformation parameter used here is defined by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the nuclear radius parameter given by @xmath24 ( fm ) .",
    "figure [ barrier - height ] shows the total energy @xmath25 at temperatures from @xmath26 to @xmath27 mev .",
    "we use sly4 for the skyrme parameter set and @xmath28 , @xmath29 mev for the pairing strength , which are determined so as to reproduce the ground state energy of @xmath4u .",
    "we determine the fission barrier height from the difference between the highest and the lowest energy in the potential energy surface .",
    "1 indicates that the barrier height of @xmath4u continuously increases with temperature , while that of @xmath5fm first increases but begins to decrease at t=0.6 mev .",
    "this feature is due to the difference in the behavior of the pairing energy between the two nuclei at the maximum and minimum points , where the energy is the highest and lowest , respectively .",
    "the pairing energy at the minimum and maximum points as a function of temperature is shown in figure [ epair ] .",
    "the pairing energy at the mimimum point is larger than that at the maximum point for @xmath4u , while it is opposite for @xmath5fm .",
    "moreover , the pairing energy at the minimum for @xmath5fm has much weaker temperature dependence than that at the maximum point .",
    "all of these features lead to the behaviors shown in figure [ barrier - height ] .        in summary",
    ", we have calculated the temperature dependence of the fission barrier for neutron - rich nucleus @xmath5fm and the @xmath4u nucleus near the stability line . for this purpose",
    ", we used the finite - temperature hartree - fock - bogoliubov with a zero - range pairing interaction .",
    "we found that the fission barrier height of @xmath4u becomes large at a high temperature and that that of @xmath5fm shows a decrease at t=0.6 mev because of the temperature dependence of the pairing energy .",
    "we used the bohr - wheeler formula in order to calculate the fission rate . by taking into account the temperature dependence of fission barrier ,",
    "the decay widths is suppressed by a facotr of @xmath30 to @xmath31 ."
