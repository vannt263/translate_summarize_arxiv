    "starburst systems in the local universe , from giant hii regions to starburst nuclei , are important laboratories to study the evolution of massive stars and physical processes thought to be associated with the very early stages of galaxy formation .",
    "these motivations , coupled to the advances in modeling and observational capabilities , have led to a burst of activity in this field during the past decade .    by far the most common approach to infer the physical properties of starbursts is to compare their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with models based on evolutionary synthesis ( eg .",
    "mas - hesse & kunth 1991 ; olofsson 1995 ; leitherer 1999 ) .",
    "this technique performs _ ab initio _ calculations of the spectral evolution of a stellar population on the basis of evolutionary tracks for stars covering a wide range of masses , stellar spectral libraries plus prescriptions for the initial mass function , star formation rate and chemical evolution .",
    "the comparison between observations and models may focus on particular spectral features , such as stellar wind lines in the uv ( robert , leitherer & heckman 1993 ) , wr features ( cervio & mas - hesse 1994 ; schaerer & vacca 1998 ) , balmer absorption lines ( gonzlez delgado , leitherer & heckman 1999 ) , lines from red super giants ( garca - vargas 1997 ; mayya 1997 ) , or on a combination of lines and the multiwavelength continuum ( mas - hesse & kunth 1999 ; lanon 2001 ) .",
    "a common difficulty faced in such studies is the contamination of the spectrum by an underlying old stellar population , which can be significant in the optical  near ir range .",
    "this contamination is sometimes removed by adopting a template spectrum for the old population ( lanon 2001 ) , or else its effects are evaluated from the excess flux between models and data ( mas - hesse & kunth 1999 ) .",
    "other uncertainties include those associated with differences between different sets of evolutionary tracks , incomplete or imperfect spectral libraries ; stochastic effects and numerical issues ( cervio 2001 ) ; and possible effects of binary stars ( mas - hesse & cervio 1999 ) .",
    "we refer the reader to the review by schaerer ( 2001 ) for a detailed discussion .",
    "the massive , hot stars in young starbursts photoionize the surrounding gas , producing an emission line spectrum which can also be used to constrain the properties of the starburst , like its age , metallicity and star - formation rate .",
    "in fact , emission line diagnostics of starbursts play a central role in this field for the simple practical reason that emission lines are much easier to measure than stellar features .",
    "a great number of studies have been devoted to developing such diagnostics through a combination of theoretical seds from evolutionary synthesis and phototoionization calculations for the corresponding nebular conditions ( garca - vargas , bressan & daz 1995 ; stasiska & leitherer 1996 ; charlot & longhetti 2001 ; moy , rocca - volmerange & fioc 2001 ; stasiska , schaerer & leitherer 2001 ; schaerer 2000 ) .    among the many diagnostic tools developed , the equivalent width of h@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) stands out as a powerful _ age indicator _ of starbursts .",
    "the prediction , known for more than 20 years ( dottori 1981 ) , is that @xmath2 decreases as a burst evolves .",
    "this behavior has been so extensively confirmed by more elaborate calculations that @xmath2 is often used as a substitute for an age axis in studies which investigate the evolution of starbursts ( e.g. , stasiska 2001 ) .",
    "other general predictions of evolutionary synthesis + photoionization models are that the gas excitation and that the equivalent width of [ oiii]@xmath35007 should decrease as a starburst evolves ( coppeti , dottori & pastoriza 1986 ; stasiska & leitherer 1996 ) although such diagnostics are more critically affected by metallicity effects .",
    "these predictions , now routinely applied to infer physical properties of starbursts , are hard to be tested directly , since that requires evaluating the age of a starburst without resorting to emission line diagnostics . in this paper",
    "we take a step back in time and investigate the empirical validity of these long known predictions by means of a simple empirical population synthesis ( eps ) analysis of starburst and hii galaxies .",
    "this analysis allows a quantitative assessment of the evolutionary state of a stellar population based only on observed stellar features .",
    "eps techniques have their own limitations ( eg , cid fernandes 2001a ) , but these are of a different nature than the uncertainties involved in evolutionary synthesis , and thus serve as an independent test of predictions of evolutionary synthesis models .",
    "our main goals are to :    * study the stellar population properties of a large and varied sample of star - forming galaxies by means of an eps analysis . *",
    "develop and test eps - based tools to assess the evolutionary state of star - forming galaxies in a quantitative and easy - to - interpret manner . *",
    "perform a model - independent investigation of the relation between gaseous properties and the evolutionary state of starbursts .    in section  [ sec : data ] we present the data sets used in this study .",
    "section [ sec : synthesis ] deals with points _",
    "( i ) _ and _ ( ii ) _ above . the eps method is presented and its results for star - forming galaxies are discussed by means of simple empirical tools designed to aid the interpretation of the synthesis .",
    "we also present a comparative study of eps and evolutionary synthesis methods , which serves to test and calibrate our tools to measure evolution . in section",
    "[ sec : emission_line_properties ] we address point _ ( iii ) _ by studying the evolution of emission line properties of starburst and hii galaxies using an eps - based measure of the burst age . section [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our main results .",
    "this investigation requires optical spectra where both gaseous ( emission lines ) and stellar properties ( continuum and absorption lines ) can be discerned .",
    "two data sets meeting this requirement were used in this work .",
    "the first set , which we denote `` sample i '' , comes from the studies of storchi - bergmann , kinney & challis ( 1995 ) and mcquade , kinney & calzetti ( 1995 ) , extracted from the atlas of kinney ( 1993 ) .",
    "this sample covers both large , luminous galaxies with star - forming nuclei ( `` starburst nuclei '' ) and smaller , weaker systems such as hii galaxies and blue compact dwarves .",
    "active galaxies were discarded , with the exception of ngc 6221 , which is dominated by starburst activity except in x - rays ( levenson 2001 ) .",
    "we further limit our analysis to those objects with metallicity estimates by storchi - bergmann , calzetti & kinney ( 1994 ) , which leaves a total of 41 galaxies , 18 of which are classified as starburst nuclei .",
    "the spectra were collected through a large @xmath4 aperture , which corresponds to a circular aperture of 1.3 @xmath5 kpc in radius at the median distance of the galaxies .",
    "emission line fluxes and equivalent widths ( @xmath6 ) for this sample were re - measured from the publicly available original spectra and found to be in good agreement with those obtained by storchi - bergmann ( 1995 ) and mcquade ( 1995 ) .",
    "all spectra were corrected for galactic extinction using the reddening law of cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 , with @xmath7 ) and the @xmath8 values from schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) as listed in ned .",
    "corrections for internal extinction were applied based on the h@xmath9/h@xmath1 ratio , whose intrinsic value was taken to be 2.86 , and allowing for underlying absorption components ( see section  [ sec : w_hb_corrections ] ) . for the stellar population analysis we have measured the @xmath6 s of the caii  k  @xmath33933 , cn  @xmath34200 and g  band  @xmath34301 with respect to a pseudo continuum defined at selected pivot points , located at @xmath10 , 3780 , 4020 and 4510  , following the methodology outlined in cid fernandes , storchi - bergmann & schmitt ( 1998 ) .",
    "our values agree very well with those of storchi - bergmann ( 1995 ) , but there were significant discrepancies between our measurements and those published by mcquade ( 1995 ) .",
    "`` sample ii '' comes from the spectrophotometric atlas of hii galaxies of terlevich ( 1991 ) , as analysed by raimann ( 2000a , b ) .",
    "most of the individual spectra in this atlas do not have enough signal to measure stellar features , which prompted raimann to average them in order to increase the stellar signal .",
    "out of 185 galaxies , they have defined 19 _ groups _ of similar characteristics .",
    "each group is then treated as if it corresponded to an individual galaxy .",
    "three of these groups are composed of seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "these were kept in our analysis only to illustrate their systematically different properties with respect to the remaining groups , 10 of which are composed of hii galaxies , 2 are starburst nuclei and 4 are classified as intermediate hii / staburst systems .",
    "the typical aperture covered by these spectra correspond to an equivalent radius of @xmath11 kpc .",
    "raimann ( 2000a ) have measured absorption line @xmath6 s and continuum fluxes for these groups following the same methodology as above .",
    "emission line properties were analysed by raimann ( 2000b ) .",
    "line fluxes were initially measured after subtraction of a stellar population model which included internal reddening .",
    "the resulting h@xmath9/h@xmath1 ratio was used to further correct for residual extinction towards the line emitting regions .",
    "we have adopted both stellar and nebular properties as published by these authors without further corrections .    in summary , of all stellar and nebular properties compiled for these 2 samples , the following will be used in the analysis below : ( 1 ) the @xmath6 s of the caii k , cn and g - band absorption features ; ( 2 ) continuum fluxes at 3600 , 4020 and 4510  ; ( 3 ) emission line fluxes and @xmath6 s of strong optical lines : [ oii]@xmath33727 , h@xmath1 , [ oiii]@xmath35007 , h@xmath9 and [ nii]@xmath36584 ; ( 4 ) nebular abundances , as listed in storchi - bergmann ( 1994 ) and raimann ( 2000b ) ; ( 5 ) the `` activity class '' , as reported in the afore mentioned papers .",
    "this last item is used to distinguish small systems like hii and blue compact galaxies from starburst nuclei , which live on larger and more luminous galaxies , usually late type spirals .",
    "the latter kind of galaxies present a more complex mixture of stellar populations and are richer in heavy elements than hii galaxies , as will become clear in the analysis that follows .",
    "in order to provide a quantitative description of the stellar populations for galaxies in samples i and ii , we have used their absorption line @xmath6 s and continuum colors as input to the eps algorithm developed by cid fernandes ( 2001a ) .",
    "the code decomposes a spectrum onto a base of 12 simple stellar populations of different ages and metallicities ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this base was defined by schmidt ( 1991 ) out of a large sample of star clusters originally observed by bica & alloin ( 1986a , b ) .",
    "the main output of the code is the _ population vector _",
    "@xmath13 , whose 12 components carry the fractional contributions of each base element to the observed flux at a given normalization wavelength @xmath14 .",
    "this vector corresponds to the _ mean _ solution found from a @xmath15 steps likelihood - guided metropolis walk through the parameter space .",
    "since colors are also modeled , extinction enters as an extra parameter , but this will not be directly used in our analysis . some eps studies ( e.g. , bica 1988 ) impose that solutions follow well behaved paths on the age-@xmath12 plane spanned by the base , in order to force consistency with simple scenarios for chemical evolution .",
    "here we follow schmidt ( 1991 ) in not imposing such _ a priori _ constraints in order to allow for more general scenarios , such as systems undergoing mergers .",
    "there are no major conceptual differences between this eps method and that originally developed by bica ( 1988 ) or its variants , which have been applied to many stellar population studies ( e.g. , bica , alloin & schmidt 1990 ; de mello 1995 ; kong & cheng 1999 ; schmitt , storchi - bergmann & cid fernandes 1999 ; raimann 2000a ) .",
    "however , in this work we will explore novel ways of expressing the results of the synthesis , which use the population vector to construct easy - to - interpret diagrams and indices .",
    "the results presented below were all obtained feeding the eps code with just 5 observables : the @xmath6 s of caii k , cn and the g - band , plus the @xmath16 and @xmath17 continuum colors .",
    "the errors on these quantities were fixed at 0.5   for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , 1   for @xmath20 , and 0.05 for the colors . as discussed by cid fernandes ( 2001a ) ,",
    "the combination of observational errors , little input information and quasi - linear dependences within the base hinders accurate estimates of all 12 components of @xmath13 , but reliable results are obtained grouping @xmath13 components of _ same age_. we have therefore employed age - grouping schemes in our analysis .",
    "the base spans 5 logarithmicaly spaced age bins : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath15 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 yr .",
    "components with these ages are combined onto a reduced 5-d population vector , whose components are denoted by @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "we will also work with an even further reduced description of stellar populations , in which the @xmath23 and @xmath24 yr old components are re - grouped onto @xmath30 , and the young @xmath21 and @xmath22 yr components are binned onto @xmath31 . renaming the `` intermediate age '' @xmath15 yr component to @xmath32 , we obtain a compact , 3-d version of the population vector : @xmath33 .",
    "normalization requires that @xmath34 , while the positivity constraint implies that all components are @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , an eps solution is confined to a triangular cut of a plane in the @xmath33 space , which facilitates the visualization of results ( see cid fernandes 2001b for an application of this scheme to trace the evolution of circumnuclear starbursts in active galaxies ) .",
    "we note that the description of a galaxy spectrum in terms of @xmath13-components is analogous to a principal component analysis ( e.g. , sodr & stasiska 1999 ) , with the difference that , by construction , each component has a known physical meaning .",
    "we concentrate our analysis of the eps results on evolutionary effects .",
    "furthermore , we focus on the evolution of recent stellar generations ( @xmath36 yr ) , associated with the star - forming activity in starburst and hii galaxies .",
    "metallicity effects are discussed using the nebular oxygen abundance , which essentially reflects the metallicity of the most recent stellar generation ( storchi - bergmann 1994 ) .",

    "second , all sample ii galaxies in which wr features have been detected ( those marked by filled symbols in fig .  [",
    "fig : evol1]b ) are located in the large @xmath38 region of the diagram , consistent with the young burst ages ( a few myr ) implied by the mere presence of wr stars .",
    "filled symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : evol1]a mark galaxies from sample i which are listed in the wr - galaxy catalog maintained by d. schaerer ( webast.ast.obs-mip.fr/people/scharer ) .",
    "their more even distribution , as compared to sample ii , is due to the old population and aperture effects discussed above and nicely illustrated by meurer ( 2000 ) . whereas the data analyzed here pertains to kpc - scales , spectra used to classify a starburst as a wr - galaxy",
    "are usually obtained through much narrower slits centered on the brightest cluster , thus favoring the detection of young systems .",
    "processing such spectra through our eps - machinery would surely move the filled points in fig .",
    "[ fig : evol1]a towards younger ages .",
    "( conversely , one would expect that narrow slit observations of galaxies represented by empty symbols in the bottom right of fig .",
    "[ fig : evol1]a , such as mrk 357 and ugca 410 , have a good chance of revealing wr features . ) finally , galaxies located in the large @xmath44 zone in the top - left ( such as ngc 1800 in sample i and group g_ngc3089 in sample ii ) have spectra typical of a `` post - starburst '' population , with pronounced high order balmer absorption lines typical of a stars ( gonzlez delgado 1999 ) .",
    "it is important to remark that neither the presence of wr features nor balmer absorption lines were used in the eps analysis , and yet the eps results are compatible with the information apported by these observables .",
    "a straight - forward theoretical reason to interpret fig .  [ fig : evol1 ] as an evolutionary sequence is that , schematicaly , a simple ( i.e. , coeval ) stellar population moves on this diagram from @xmath47 at age @xmath48 to @xmath49 after some @xmath15 yr and then to @xmath50 for ages @xmath51 yr .    in order to follow this evolutionary path more closely we have carried out an eps analysis of _ theoretical _ galaxy spectra from gissel96 , the evolutionary synthesis code of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) .",
    "the theoretical spectra were processed in exactly the same way as the real spectra of samples i and ii .",
    "instantaneous burst and continuous star - formation models were computed for various ages between @xmath48 and 15 gyr , a salpeter imf between 0.1 and 125 @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",

    "we have chosen the one which uses the atlas of jacoby , hunter & christian ( 1984 ) for the optical range .",
    "the absorption features necessary for our eps are clearly defined with this library .",
    "spectral resolution was in fact the reason we have chosen gissel96 over the starburst99 code of leitherer ( 1999 ) , which is more taylored to study young stellar populations but currently works with an optical library too coarse for eps analysis .",

    "the absorption correction degrades the @xmath2-@xmath0 correlation for sample i slightly . for the combined sample i + ii data the @xmath101 value increases from @xmath116 to @xmath117 , which is still significant at the 5-@xmath118 level .",
    "we thus see that these ` 1@xmath119 order corrections ' introduce very little scatter , and do not alter our conclusion that @xmath2 does indeed evolve along with the stars that make up a starburst .",
    "one can also look at this result the other way around , and conclude that the fact that the @xmath2 versus @xmath0 diagram behaves as expected proves the usefulness of our eps - based evolutionary index @xmath0 , with the advantage that it is immune to the dilution and absorption effects which plague @xmath2 and other emission - line based age indicators .",
    "we note in passing that these corrections alone are enough to bring the values of @xmath2 within the range spanned by evolutionary synthesis calculations such as those by leitherer ( 1999 ) , whereas , as it has long been known , the raw observed values fall bellow such predictions ( bressolin , kennicutt & garnett 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "differential extinction , with line emitting regions being more reddened than the stellar continuum ( calzetti , kinney & storchi - bergmann 1994 ) and leakage of ionizing photons out of the hii regions associated with the starburst are further examples of processes that act in the sense of reducing @xmath2 .",
    "we thus concur with raimann ( 2000b ) and stasiska ( 2001 ) in that the apparent mismatch between theoretical and observed values of @xmath2 bears no fundamental physical significance .",

    "[ fig : w_o3_x_age_sbmq]b also shows that the higher @xmath12 galaxies tend to have older starbursts , an effect which is further discussed below .",
    "another prediction of evolutionary synthesis plus photoionization calculations is that the gas excitation decreases with time , because the ratio of ionizing photons per gas particle ( the `` ionization parameter '' ) decreases and the ionizing spectrum softens as the hotter stars die ( e.g. , copetti 1986 ; cid fernandes 1992 ; garca - vargas 1995 ; stasiska & leitherer 1996 ) . in figs .",

    "the scattered distribution of metal rich objects in these plots is in qualitative agreement with the models by stasiska ( 2001 ) , which show that @xmath12-dependent indices such as those used in figs .",
    "[ fig : w_hb_x_age_sbmq][fig : excitation_raimann ] are _ not _ good chronometers for metal rich starbursts .",
    "a more intriguing result is the systematic displacement of high @xmath12 galaxies towards large @xmath0 .",
    "a naive interpretation of this offset would be that these systems represent the late stages of evolution of metal poor starbursts . in this scenario ,",
    "a triangle would become a circle and then a square in figs .",
    "[ fig : w_hb_x_age_sbmq][fig : excitation_raimann ] .",
    "note , however , that this would require that ( o / h ) increases by factors of 310 in less than @xmath15 yr .",
    "furthermore , this scenario would not be general , since there are several metal poor objects with large @xmath0 .",
    "a more appropriate reading of figs .",
    "[ fig : w_hb_x_age_sbmq][fig : excitation_raimann ] is that there is a wide spread in @xmath12 for evolved starbursts , but there is practically no young metal rich system ( the single exception being group g_mrk710 ) .",
    "this dichotomy is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : metallicity ] , where @xmath12 is plotted against @xmath0 for both samples .",
    "we attribute this behavior to the fact that , as already explained , metal rich sources are predominantly starburst nuclei , whereas hii galaxies dominate the lower @xmath12 bins , as can be seen comparing the location of filled and open symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : metallicity ] . in most hii galaxies",
    "the starburst population is dominated by the youngest generations , partly due to selection effects ( see section [ sec : w_hb_corrections ] ) and partly due to the fact that these are small galaxies , where a single burst can have a large impact .",
    "in fact , instantaneous burst models often provide an acceptable description of these systems , provided allowance is made for the presence of an old underlying population ( mas - hesse & kunth 1999 ) .",
    "starburst nuclei , on the other hand , present a more even distribution of stellar ages in the @xmath21@xmath15 yr range ( lanon 2001 ) , more compatible with an extended star formation episode than with a coeval burst .",
    "this age mixture is detected by the synthesis , resulting in a skew of the @xmath0 index towards larger values .",
    "we therefore conclude that the trend of @xmath12 with @xmath0 simply reflects the fact that metal rich objects have a more complex recent history of star formation than metal poor objects .",
    "we have investigated the evolution of emission line properties in starburst nuclei and hii galaxies using age diagnostics based on their observed integrated stellar population properties .",
    "our main results can be divided in two parts .    in the first part of this paper",
    ", we have presented the results of an empirical population synthesis ( eps ) analysis of star - forming galaxies and explored ways to condense these results onto simple diagrams and indices designed to assess the evolutionary state of a stellar population .",
    "two useful tools were developed :    * _ an evolutionary diagram : _ a compact description of stellar populations in terms of young ( @xmath128 yr ) , intermediate age ( @xmath15 yr ) and old ( @xmath51 yr ) components allows the evolutionary state of a galaxy to be assessed by its location on a @xmath33 diagram , each axis carrying the contribution of stars within a given age range to the total flux . *",
    "_ mean ages : _ flux  weighted mean ages of both the total stellar population ( @xmath83 ) and the starburst component ( @xmath0 ) were defined .",
    "both tools were tested with theoretical galaxy spectra for instantaneous bursts and continuous star formation .",
    "these tests showed that the evolution of stellar populations is adequately mapped by these empirical tools , supporting their application to real galaxies .",
    "perhaps the main conclusion here is that one can achieve a good first order description of the evolutionary state of a starburst using very little spectral information ; our analysis used just 3 absorption lines plus 2 continuum colors in the 36004500 interval .",
    "the eps - analysis of two samples of starbursting galaxies showed them be distributed along the direction of evolution in the @xmath33 diagram .",
    "this result encouraged us to use our mean starburst age @xmath0 as an _ empirical clock _ to gauge the evolutionary state of starbursts .    in the second part of this study",
    "we have investigated correlations between the emission line properties of starburst nuclei and hii galaxies and the @xmath0 index in order to test , in a completely empirical way , whether emission lines evolve along with the stars in starbursts .",
    "the results of this investigation can be summarized as follows .",
    "* we have verified that the equivalent widths of h@xmath1 and [ oiii ] decrease for increasing @xmath0 .",
    "this is in accordance with well known , but little tested , theoretical expectations . *",
    "the use of @xmath2 and @xmath125}$ ] as age indicators is hampered by the the diluting effects of an old underlying stellar population unrelated to the starburst . besides providing a quantitative assessment of evolution , the eps analysis provides a straight forward estimate of this effect .",
    "* as a whole , starburst nuclei are found to have a more even distribution of stellar ages in the @xmath21@xmath15 yr range than hii galaxies , which are often dominated by the youngest generations .",
    "* three seyfert 2 objects were also analysed , two of which have stellar population characteristics radically different from those in starburst galaxies , as seen , for instance , by their location on the evolutionary diagram .",
    "these two sources also have dilution - corrected @xmath2 values well above those of starbursts .",
    "the third object has characteristics suggestive of a composite starburst + seyfert 2 system . * the gas excitation , as measured by emission line ratios , was found to decrease systematically for increasing @xmath0 , also in agreement with theoretical predictions .",
    "this evolutionary sequence is only well defined for metal poor objects , which are mostly hii galaxies .",
    "metal rich galaxies do not present clear evolutionary trends in the gas excitation indices , in qualitative agreement with photoionization models for evolving starbursts .",
