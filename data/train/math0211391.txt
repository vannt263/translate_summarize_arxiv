    "our purpose in this paper is to demonstrate that the newton polytope of a polynomial @xmath1 also has a crucial influence on its _ mass density _ @xmath21 and on the _ spatial distribution _ of _ zeros _ @xmath22 .",
    "we will show that there is a _ classically allowed region _ where the mass almost surely concentrates and a _ classically forbidden region _ where it almost surely is exponentially decaying .",

    "the simultaneous zeros in @xmath2 of @xmath3 generic polynomials @xmath27 with newton polytope @xmath6 tend to concentrate ( in the limit of high degrees ) in the classically allowed region , giving a kind of quantitative localized version of the bernstein - kouchnirenko theorem @xcite .",
    "polynomials with a given newton polytope @xmath6 are often called _ sparse _ in the literature , and methods of algebraic ( including toric ) geometry have recently been applied to the computational problem of locating zeros of systems of such sparse polynomials ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "our results give information on the expected location of zeros when the polynomials are given the conditional measure described below . to our knowledge , this kind of precise asymptotic concentration of zeros of sparse systems of random polynomials has not been observed before .",
    "the newton polytope has an equally strong ( though different ) impact on the common zeros of @xmath28 polynomials @xmath29 .",
    "the image of the zero set of @xmath29 under the moment map is ( up to a logarithmic re - parameterization ) known as an _ amoeba _ in the sense of @xcite .",
    "results on the expected distribution of amoebas can be obtained from our results on the expected zero current ; for example , for a polytope @xmath30 with vertices in the interior of the standard unit simplex @xmath31 , there is also a _ very forbidden region _ which the amoeba almost surely avoids ( see corollary  [ subtler ] ) .",
    "the patterns in zeros discussed here are statistical  they hold for random polynomials with prescribed newton polytope  and are asymptotic as the degree of the polynomials tends to infinity .",

    "the @xmath47-invariant gaussian measure @xmath57 corresponding to the inner product ( [ inner ] ) is defined by @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the coefficients @xmath60 are independent complex gaussian random variables with mean zero and variance one .",
    "we then endow the space @xmath41 with the associated _ conditional probability measure _ @xmath61 : @xmath62 where the coefficients @xmath60 are again independent complex gaussian random variables with mean zero and variance one .",

    "bzout s theorem tells us that @xmath3 generic homogeneous polynomials @xmath86 of degree @xmath18 have exactly @xmath87 simultaneous zeros in @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , one immediately sees ( by uniqueness of haar probability measure on @xmath26 ) that the expected distribution of zeros is uniform with respect to the @xmath47-invariant projective volume form , when the ensemble is given the @xmath47-invariant measure @xmath88 .    according to the bernstein - kouchnirenko theorem @xcite , the number of common zeros in @xmath2 of @xmath3 generic polynomials @xmath89 with given newton polytope @xmath6 equals @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the euclidean volume of @xmath6 .",

    "our first result shows that , as the polytope @xmath6 expands , these zeros are expected to concentrate in the classically allowed region and have ( asymptotically ) uniform density there .",
    "we measure the density of zeros with respect to the projective volume @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the fubini - study khler form on @xmath104 .",

    "in fact , our results imply that the convergence of the zero current on the classically allowed region is exponentially fast in the sense that @xmath110 for some positive continuous function @xmath111 on @xmath112 .",

    "we shall show that @xmath120 is asymptotically uniform with respect to fubini - study measure in the classically allowed region ( as if there were no constraint at all ) ; while in the forbidden region the mass decays exponentially .",
    "thus in the semiclassical limit @xmath15 , all the mass concentrates in the classically allowed region .",
    "behavior of the expected mass density ( as well as the zero distribution in positive dimension ) in the forbidden region is subtle , so we pause to introduce the relevant concepts .",
    "we show in  [ s - normalbundle ] that the classically forbidden region decomposes into the disjoint union of the normal ` flow - outs ' of boundary points of @xmath6 , @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the normal cone to @xmath6 at @xmath124 ( see  [ s - fans ] ) . here",

    "combined with the poincar - lelong formula , this uniform convergence result leads to the asymptotics of the expected distribution of zeros of a single random polynomial with polytope @xmath9 . using independence of sections and the bedford - taylor theorem @xcite on continuity of the monge - ampre operator",
