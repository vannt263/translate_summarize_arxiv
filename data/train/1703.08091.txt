    "the momenta of charged particles are measured by the tracker , energies of photons are measured by the electromagnetic calorimeter , and energies of neutral hadrons are measured by the hadron calorimeter . to improve the performance of pfa , it is necessary to distinguish the particles in the jet .",

    "the charge reaches a p@xmath0 surface at first , then running through the resistive p@xmath0 surface to the electrodes .",
    "this devides the charges by resistive division , so we can calculate the incident position from the function of the charge recorded at each electrode .",
    "this mechanism gives higher position resolution without further dividing electrodes .",
    "psd sensors are expected to enhance the function of ild ecal by improving position resolution of photons .",
    "psds can be used at the innermost layers of ecal where hit density is much smaller than the shower maximum region .",
    "we can employ larger cell sizes for those layers to avoid increasing number of readout channels , considering psd needs four electrodes on one cell .",
    "we expect less than 1 mm position resolution with psd in 1 @xmath1 cells , which is significantly less than the resolution with conventional pads of @xmath2 mm@xmath3 cells .",

    "first , the reconstruction of @xmath4 from two photons can be improved .",
    "the improved position resolution can be used for the kinematic fit of @xmath4 reconstruction , which leads to improve the jet energy resolution and reconstruction of heavy quarks ( @xmath5/@xmath6 tagging ) .",
    "psds can also be used for strip tracking detectors in order to reduce ghost hits by obtaining hit positions roughly along the strips .",

    "since the photon energy is slightly higher than the band gap energy of silicon , one optical photon creates one electron - hole pair in the silicon , and imitate signal at the well defined position .",

    "was carried out for 2 hours in a state with and without a radiation source . during this time , the sum of the signals from four electrodes after passing shaper amplifier from the four electrodes exceeded 400 mv was treated as an event . in the pixel type silicon sensor , 4 pixels out of 9 pixels were used in a state with a radiation source .",
    "when the signal of 1 pixel exceeded 100 mv , it was treated as an event . at this time , the output values of the other three pixels are recorded as a pedestal .",
    "figure [ fig : baby44 ] is the distribution of the adc output in one pixel of a conventional pixel type silicon sensor .",
    "it seems that the signal from the beta source on the right side of the plot and the pedestal on the left seem to be separated well , but it seems to be seen separately by the trigger .",
    "figure [ fig : aaaa ] is the distribution of the sum of the adc outputs from the four electrodes of psd with and without radiation source .",
    "this shows that the signal comes more frequently with radiation source than without , however the difference on the distribution is not clear , mainly due to a noise coherent to all channels .",
    "we plan to reduce this system noise in the future and try again to measure the radiation source .",
    "psd is a silicon device which can derive the incident position of a particle by resistive devision of the charge to electrodes at the p@xmath0 surface .",
