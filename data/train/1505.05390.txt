    "in fact , it is composed of two families of orthogonal , spherically symmetric , nambu strings .",
    "the price to pay for that is that this wormhole is nontraversable since an extended body can not cross the contact points at @xmath10  @xcite .",

    "we also show that interesting scattering resonances , at well - defined frequencies , appear for other choices of boundary conditions . since this spacetime is everywhere flat except at the points where",
