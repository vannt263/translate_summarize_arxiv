    "a driving force behind high energy physics is the search for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "an approach receiving considerable attention generalizes the effects of new physics using effective lagrangians ( @xmath1 ) and tests for deviations from sm expectations . while the fermion gauge boson couplings have been measured to high precision by the lep and slc experiments the vector boson self - interactions",
    "have only just been experimentally verified by direct measurement@xcite . because the standard model makes precise predictions for the tgv s",
    ", precision measurements constitute a stringent test of the gauge structure of the standard model @xcite . in this contribution",
    "we describe some recent work on precision measurements of tri - linear gauge boson couplings ( tgv s ) at @xmath2 colliders ; lep200 and 500  gev and 1  tev versions of the nlc .",
    "a more detailed account of this work is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the processes @xmath3 , including all tree level feynman diagrams that contribute to the same final state , have been studied for a number of specific final states ; @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . our present work consists of a detailed study of the last process , @xmath8 , and its sensitivity to tgv s .",
    "this process can be fully reconstructed and has the advantage of a higher branching ratio than the purely leptonic processes while avoiding the ambiguities and backgrounds associated with the purely hadronic modes .",
    "there are three effective lagrangians commonly used to describe tgv s which differ on the degree of generality assumed @xcite .    1 .",
    "_ most general parametrization_. the only assumptions here are lorentz and @xmath9 invariance .",
    "the parameters associated with the cp invariant operators are @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is always equal to 1 and in the sm at tree level @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "typically , radiative corrections from heavy particles will change @xmath18 by about 0.015 and @xmath19 by about 0.0025 .",
    "the most robust limits come from associated @xmath20 and @xmath21 production at the tevatron @xcite ; @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "non - linearly realized goldstone bosons _ or _ the chiral lagrangian _",
    "includes custodial @xmath26 symmetry which is experimentally verified to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "the parameters of this lagrangian are @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath29 contributes to the gauge boson self energies where it is tightly constrained to @xmath30 so we will not consider it further .",
    "@xmath31 are expected to be of order 1 .",
    "_ linearly realized goldstone bosons _ explicitly includes the goldstone bosons .    due to space limitations we only present results for the chiral lagrangian but note that the different lagrangians can be mapped onto one another .",
    "we studied the final states @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in the first case",
    "ten diagrams contribute and in the second , 20 diagrams .",
    "we used the calkul helicity technique to calculate the amplitudes and integrated the resulting matrix elements using monte carlo methods to obtain the cross sections and distributions .    for our numerical results we used the following set of parameters : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we included the kinematic cut @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the angle of the charged lepton , quark , or antiquark relative to the beam axis .",
    "we also took @xmath42  gev . in some of our results we imposed that @xmath43  gev where @xmath44 is the invariant mass of the @xmath45 pair .",
    "the object of the analysis is to maximize the sensitivity to anomalous gauge boson couplings .",
    "the longitudinal components of the @xmath46 are most sensitive to anomalous couplings .",
    "@xmath47 s ( @xmath48 s ) produced parallel to the incoming @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) are dominated by transverse @xmath46 s while those in the backward direction have a large @xmath51 content . to extract the @xmath51 s from the @xmath52 `` background ''",
    "we can use the @xmath46 decay products as a polarimeter ; @xmath52 decay products peak at forward or backward angles while those of the @xmath51 s peak about @xmath53 where @xmath41 is the angle of the decay product with respect to the @xmath46 direction in the @xmath46 rest frame . the changing mix of @xmath51 and @xmath52 is illustrated in fig . 1 by the quark angular distributions for forward and backward @xmath46 scattering angles @xmath54 .",
    "additional information can be obtained by studying the decay product azimuthal distributions which are subject to more complicated interference .    to determine if anomalous couplings are measurable we use the maximum likelihood method applied to the differential cross section : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the scattering angle of the outgoing @xmath46 s and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the polar and azimuthal decay angles of the outgoing @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) in the @xmath46 rest frame .",
    "we divided each of the angles into 4 bins .",
    "summing over all 1024 bins and comparing the sm predictions to those for anomalous couplings we obtain the log likelihood function : @xmath61}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the measured and expected number of events respectively .",
    "we show the 95% c.l .",
    "contours for the @xmath64 plane for lep200 and 500  gev and 1  tev nlc options in fig .",
    "2 .    one can obtain additional information from the processes studied here .",
    "possibilities we have studied but have not included here for lack of space are :    1 .   _ initial state polarization . _",
    "the distributions are different for left and right handed initial state electrons mainly due to the contributions of the neutrino exchange diagram to the @xmath65 mode but not the @xmath66 mode .",
    "this results in different dependences on anomalous couplings adding to the measurement sensitivity .",
    "single @xmath46 production .",
    "_ in the @xmath67 ( or @xmath68 ) final state , instead of imposing the kinematic cut that the final state @xmath50 ( @xmath49 ) be observed we can impose the cut that it not be observed . in this case the cross section is dominated by the t - channel photon pole providing a mechanism for measuring the @xmath69 vertex independent of the @xmath70 vertex .",
    "3 .   _ off resonance production . _ the deviations from the sm value cross sections can be dramatic off the @xmath46 resonances . although the off - shell contributions by themselves do nt offer improvements to the on - shell @xmath46 results , including the off resonance contributions can improve the overall sensitivities in certain cases .",
    "we have presented some results from a study of tgv s in the process @xmath71 .",
    "we employed a maximum likelihood analysis of a five dimensional differential cross section of angular distributions .",
    "lep200 will improve on existing measurements , but not sufficiently to observe deviations originating from loop contributions from heavy particles .",
    "on the other hand the nlc will be able to measure these couplings to better that a half of a percent which would be sensitive to radiative corrections to the tgv s .",
