    "the von neumann entropy of a block of @xmath2 contiguous sites in a system of size @xmath3 with periodic boundary conditions follows the law @xcite @xmath4    there is ample evidence that the inclusion of strong off - diagonal disorder between nearest neighbors gives raise to a disorder - averaged von neumann entropy similar to eq .",
    "( [ s.cft ] ) , but with a different _ effective _ value for the central charge @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the von neumann entropy of the ground state of a system with two sites .",
    "indeed , the striking similarities between the clean and the strongly disordered systems are even deeper than expression ( [ s.disorder ] ) suggests , since they also appear in the averages for the correlation functions and the finite - size effects in entanglement @xcite .",
    "those similarities will be the main focus of this work .    in this work we will consider the random - xx model or , in other terms , the fermionic random - hopping hamiltonian in 1d : @xmath7    in the clean case , the system is critical , and the central charge of the associated cft is @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath9 factor is found by considering what is the entanglement entropy between sites in a @xmath10 system , i.e. : @xmath11 .",
    "thus , we can fill in the values @xmath8 and @xmath12 in expression ( [ s.disorder ] ) .    whenever the @xmath13 are different , expression ( [ random.hop ] )",

    "indeed , a careful choice for the @xmath13 can be used to model quantum matter on a curved space - time background @xcite .",
    "the modes have some generic mathematical properties , such as particle - hole symmetry : a canonical transformation @xmath18 transforms @xmath19 .",

    ", the ground state can be proved to take place at half filling and is spatially homogeneous .",
    "let us consider the @xmath23 to be independent random variables extracted from a probability distribution @xmath24 pertaining to the following family @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 ; @xmath28 characterizes the randomness , i.e. @xmath29 for the uniform distribution .",
    "we will focus on the @xmath30 limit , the so - called strong disorder regime @xcite , in which the sampled @xmath31 span many orders of magnitude in the interval @xmath32 . in this regime",
    ", the renormalization group ( rg ) derived by dasgupta and ma @xcite gives an accurate description of the ground state .",
    "it proceeds through decimation : at each rg step , we select the highest hopping and put a fermion resonating between the two sites , i.e. : a _ bond_. in the spin - chain view , we would speak of a singlet between both spins .",
    "the two sites are then removed from the chain , and their neighbors are linked by a new effective hopping term . the procedure is repeated and , when it is finished , the ground state can be written as a _ random bond _ ( or random singlet ) structure . under successive applications of the dasgupta - ma rg approach ,",
    "the probability distribution for the remaining hoppings , @xmath24 flows by increasing the value of @xmath28 , and @xmath30 is the ( unattainable ) infinite - randomness fixed point ( irfp ) @xcite .",

    "the aim of this work is to illuminate the surprising relation between entanglement in critical states , as described by cft , and average entanglement entropies in strongly disordered systems . in section [ sec : computing ]",
    "we will discuss the techniques which will be employed to obtain expectation values of entanglement measures , using both exact diagonalization and the rg . in section [ sec : gs ] we will discuss the finite - size scaling of the average von neumann and rnyi block entropies within the ground state of our model .",
    "the statistics of the bond lengths is discussed in detail in section [ sec : bondpic ] . by successive distillation of the basic physics",
    "we will reach a simple model which yields accurate predictions for average entropies , based solely on the analysis of random permutations in section [ sec : perm ] .",
    "the study of the excited states , performed in section [ sec : exc ] , benefits from the different approaches discussed before .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to the exposition of conclusions and further work .",
    "our aim is to study the statistical properties of the entanglement of the ground state of hamiltonian ( [ random.hop ] ) on a 1d system with size @xmath3 and periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , when the couplings @xmath23 are chosen as independent random variables from the probability distribution ( [ prob.delta ] ) , specially in the strong disorder limit @xmath30 .",
    "the physics of the low - energy eigenstates of hamiltonian ( [ random.hop ] ) can be analyzed with two methods :    _ 1.- exact diagonalization ( ed)_. in order to obtain the ground state of ( [ random.hop ] ) it suffices to diagonalize the hopping matrix @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , whose non - zero elements are @xmath35 .",
    "its eigenstates , @xmath36 , constitute the modes , which allow us to compute the correlation matrix : @xmath37 for the ground state of the system : a fermi state of @xmath38 fermions .",
    "given any block @xmath39 of @xmath2 sites in the system , the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix , i.e. : its entanglement spectrum , can be obtained using a reverse form of wick s theorem @xcite .",
    "let @xmath40 be the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix when restricted to that block , then the reduced density matrix @xmath41 of the block is a product of density matrices of single - site blocks @xmath42 and the @xmath43-th order rnyi entropy can be obtained as a sum of the entropies of @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are other fermionic operators @xmath47\\ ] ] and the von neumann entropy for the block corresponds to the limit @xmath48 , @xmath49.\\ ] ]    the application of this technique in our case presents a serious problem : the diagonalization of the hopping matrix is a highly ill - conditioned problem , since their eigenvalues differ by many orders of magnitude .",
    "thus , it is a numerical challenge to obtain the actual block entropy , given a realization of the @xmath23 . in practice , it is unfeasible to study systems with either @xmath3 or @xmath28 too large .    _ 2.- dasgupta - ma renormalization group ( rg)_. within the strong disorder regime , we can rely on the renormalization group ( rg ) scheme devised by dasgupta and ma @xcite to find out the bond structure which describes the ground state of the system .",
    "this is a decimation procedure in which one chooses the strongest link , @xmath50 and establishes a single - particle state as a bond on top of it .",
    "then , the two neighboring sites are joined by a renormalized ( effective ) link , whose strength can be found using second - order perturbation theory : @xmath51    the strongest link and its two neighbours are replaced by this ( weaker ) renormalized link , then we proceed to pick the second strongest link , and iterate the process until all the links have been renormalized ( assuming even @xmath3 ) . at some moment",
    ", the strongest link will be one of the renormalized links in previous iterations .",
    "thus , a long - distance bond will be established between two sites which were not nearest neighbors .",
    "why do such long - distance bonds exist ?",
    "the physical picture is illustrated in figure [ fig.illust ] .",
    "let us consider the particle at the rightmost site .",
    "it has a certain probability of hopping to its left , whenever the inner bond particle is also at its left site . at this moment , the inner bond becomes doubly occupied .",
    "the original particle inside the inner bond is not allowed to hop rightwards , but it may hop leftwards . as particles are indistinguishable , the total procedure can be described as a tunneling of one particle through an established bond .",
    "the associated probability amplitude of this event is much lower than the probability amplitude of hopping in the inner bond , thus accounting for the large differences in energy between them .",
    "this procedure , which is akin to the anderson mechanism describing the interaction between a magnetic impurity and the spin of a conduction electron , can be assigned an effective hopping amplitude using second - order perturbation theory , thus obtaining expression ( [ renormalized.coupling ] ) .",
    "similarly , one can think of the second - order procedure which allows to find an effective heisenberg hamiltonian with @xmath52 from a hubbard system in the limit @xmath53 .",
    "when the decimation procedure is finished , we obtain a bond - structure , as those illustrated in figure ( [ fig.bonds ] ) , with many bonds of length one , but still with a large fraction covering larger distances . notice that the random - bond state factorizes into pairs , i.e.",
    ": there is a pairing of the sites @xmath54 , such that the ground state for the system factorizes into the product of a singlet state for every pair . in other words ,",
    "each pair @xmath55 is disentangled from the rest of the system .",
    "the entanglement entropy of any block @xmath39 can be found by simply counting the number of bonds which connect @xmath39 to the rest of the system , and multiplying by @xmath56 , which is the entropy associated to a single bond .",
    "thus , the rg opens the possibility of a purely combinatorial solution to this problem , which will be discussed in section [ sec : perm ] .",
    "notice that , within the bond picture , all rnyi entropies are equal .    remarkably , the dasgupta - ma rg has recently received an interpretation within the the tensor - networks and holography language @xcite .",
    "let @xmath57 be the disorder - averaged rnyi entropy of a block of size @xmath2 of order @xmath43 .",
    "when @xmath58 , i.e. , the von neumann entropy , we will sometimes drop the index .",
    "figure [ fig.diag ] compares the averaged rnyi entropies with both methods , exact diagonalization and rg , for a chain with pbc , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the rg approach yields the same curve for all orders @xmath61 , while they differ for exact diagonalization .",
    "notice that the rg entropy is closest to the @xmath62 exact diagonalization entropy .",
    "the difference between the rg predictions and the exact diagonalization results can be ascribed to inaccuracies in the bond - structure picture .",
    "figure ( [ fig.fluct ] ) shows a histogram of the values of the von neumann entropy at half - chain for different disorder realizations .",
    "notice that , as @xmath28 increases , the behavior becomes closer to the bond - structure picture , which predicts a set of delta peaks at integer multiples of @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the average half - chain von neumann entropy @xmath63 is specially useful to determine the global behavior disregarding finite - size effects .",
    "we have run five million realizations of the disorder with @xmath60 and @xmath3 in the range from @xmath64 to @xmath65 , and obtained the average half - chain entropy as a function of @xmath3 using the dasgupta - ma rg , as shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.sgs ] .",
    "the fit to a form like ( [ s.disorder ] ) is very accurate @xcite : @xmath63 grows logarithmically with a factor @xmath66 , and the fit for @xmath67 , i.e. : very close to @xmath68 .",

    "the average entropy for blocks of different sizes is shown in figure ( [ fig.sgs ] , bottom ) .",
    "we depict @xmath70 as a function of the fraction of the chain occupied by the block , @xmath71 using the same data . all the points collapse to a single scaling function , which we fit to a cft finite - size form @xcite @xmath72,\\ ] ] and plot the resulting curve along with the points .",
    "the difference between the fitting curve and the points is apparent , so we proceed to substract them and plot the result in the inset of figure ( [ fig.sgs ] , bottom ) .",
    "the residual appears to correspond to _ higher harmonics _ , showing that a different scaling function , @xmath73 , is required to account for the finite - size effects @xcite .",
    "the fourier series representation of that function can be written as @xmath74 \\sin{x } - \\sum_{j}^{\\infty }    \\frac{k_j}{2j+1 } \\sin{[(2j+1)x]}\\ ] ] and the more general expression for the finite - size average von neumann entropy is given by @xmath75 } + c'\\ ] ] the contribution of the first modes provides a good approximation to the entropy .",
    "fitting the finite - size data to this new functional form , we find the additive constant @xmath76 and the amplitude of the first mode @xmath77 , which are close to the value @xmath78 reported by laflorencie and @xcite and the value @xmath79 obtained by fagotti et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "despite the many similarities between the average behavior of entanglement in the random hopping model and a conformally invariant system in 1d , there are also substantial differences .",
    "one of the most relevant is in the rnyi entropies . in the conformal case they present characteristic parity oscillations @xcite : @xmath80 } +    c^{\\prime}\\\\ \\label{renyi.osc }     & + & ( -1)^{\\ell } f_\\alpha \\[\\frac{l}{\\pi } \\sin{\\(\\pi \\frac{\\ell}{l}\\)}\\]^    { -2k/ \\alpha}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath81 are the same as in eq .",

    "these oscillations bear resemblance to the density oscillations found by @xcite in a clean system , which are explained as an effect of the boundaries and subleading corrections to the cft prediction .",
    "notice that the variance is always higher for the even blocks , and the even - odd difference is much larger for smaller blocks . also let us remark that although the average number of outgoing bonds increases smoothly as we increase the block size , the probability distributions are quite different : even - sized blocks can only cut an even - number of bonds , and viceversa .",
    "let us consider what are the differences in the case of open boundary conditions . in that case ,",

    "it is customary to choose blocks starting from the left extreme . in that case block",
    "only presents one inner boundary instead of two .",
    "the cft prediction for the clean ( critical ) case is that the prefactor of the logarithmic term in the expression of the von neumann entropy is halved . in the disordered case",
    "we can also observe a reduction of the entanglement entropy , but with remarkable differences .",
    "figure ( [ fig.open ] ) shows the average von neumann entropy for three sizes ( @xmath96 , @xmath64 and @xmath97 ) with open boundary conditions , using @xmath95 realizations with @xmath101 .",

    "thus , even though the entropy is reduced in the case of open boundary conditions , the results in this case differ considerably from the expectation that @xmath112 should be one , but the value for @xmath113 agrees with previous results obtained for clean systems @xcite .      on the other hand , disordered chains present very different behavior when the number of sites is _ odd _ , as opposed to the clean case .",
    "effectively , in that case one site is not allowed to establish a bond , and entanglement is effectively reduced , see fig .",
    "( [ fig.odd ] ) .",
    "moreover , bonds can not be established over the single site and , thus , this site can be regarded as an _ opening _ in the boundary conditions .",

    "it sometimes finds _ coincidences _ , i.e. : despite all elements are initially different , after some rg steps , some of them will coincide .",
    "if the coinciding elements are sufficiently far apart , the order in which we renormalize them is immaterial . in a few cases",
    ", they are close enough , thus forcing to choose one of them randomly in order to proceed . nonetheless , those coincidences get more and more sparse as the system size grows , and become negligible in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "let us show that the dasgupta - ma rg and the random permutations model give the same results for the entanglement .",
    "as it was discussed above , all the relevant magnitudes stem from a single function : the probability distribution for @xmath0 .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the main feature of the random permutations model is the strong hierarchy among the link strengths . our model bears strong similarities to the _ hierarchical model _ of rna - folding @xcite . in this model ,",
    "random binding energies are provided for each pair of sites on a 1d chain , and bonds are established among them in order with a no - crossing condition .",
    "renormalization group arguments show that the universality class is captured merely by choosing the @xmath179 binding energies @xmath180 such that @xmath181 .",
    "this model can be considered an infinite - dimensional version of the random hopping model .",
    "entanglement of excited states has been studied recently within the cft framework @xcite . in this section",
    "we will extend the techniques developed in our work to study the excited states of the random hopping model .",
    "indeed , entanglement of all eigenstates can be constructed using either exact diagonalization , dasgupta - ma rg or random permutations approaches . as it has been stated above",
    ", the eigenstates of the hopping matrix constitute the single - body modes : bonds between pairs of sites , with negative energy , and their corresponding anti - bonds , with positive energy .",
    "the ground state is obtained by filling up the set of all negative energy modes , i.e. : all the bonds .",
    "the full spectrum of the hamiltonian is obtained as we either reduce the number of particles to allow empty modes and/or add particles in modes with positive energy .",
    "both negative and positive energy modes , bonds and anti - bonds , give the same contribution to the entanglement entropy but , when both are present on the same pair of sites , their contribution to entanglement cancels out , leaving two factorized sites .    for a clean system , the entanglement entropy increases substantially when a particle - hole ( ph ) excitation is created , i.e. : when a particle in an occupied mode is upgraded to an empty state above the fermi level @xcite .",
    "moreover , entanglement remains invariant for _ compact states _",
    ", i.e. : states in which the list of occupied modes presents no holes .",
    "those states are represented by vertex operators .",
    "the situation is very different for the strongly disordered system .",
    "figure ( [ fig.expict ] ) illustrates the different types of excited states and their effects on entanglement . in the top - left panel we show a possible bond structure describing the ground state .",
    "the lowest energy excitation is the compact state obtained by either removing the weakest bond or adding a particle on the weakest anti - bond .",
    "both cases result in the longest bond being removed from the system , as shown in the top - right panel .",
    "a second compact excitation can be obtained by removing / adding a further particle , as shown in the bottom - left panel .",
    "the last panel shows the effect of a ph excitation , in which the longest bond is upgraded to be an anti - bond , which leaves the entanglement structure untouched .",
    "let @xmath182 denote the excited state in which @xmath183 particles have been removed from the ground state ( equivalently , we could say added ) , and let @xmath184 denote the average von neumann entropy of a block of size @xmath2 within state @xmath182 .",
    "figure ( [ fig.excited.ed ] , top ) shows this average von neumann entropy for the ground state and three excited states , obtained with exact diagonalization and the rg .",
    "the first one , the ph excitation , coincides with the entanglement of the ground state .",
    "the other two correspond to states @xmath185 and @xmath186 , in which one ( @xmath187 ) or two ( @xmath188 ) particles are added or removed .",
    "notice that , in this case , a _ plateau _ appears for intermediate block sizes , similar to the one appearing for the ground state of odd - sized systems .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "( [ fig.excited.ed ] ) shows how this plateau reduces slowly its height as the number of added / removed particles increases , i.e. : the curves @xmath184 flatten progressively for increasing @xmath183 .",
    "figure ( [ fig.excited ] , top ) shows the behavior of @xmath187 for sizes ranging from @xmath96 to @xmath189 , as obtained with the rg .",
    "all of them present a similar plateau , but at increasing heights .",
    "notice that the sizes are in geometric progression , and the plateau heights appear to grow only arithmetically .",
    "this shows that the behavior of @xmath190 is be _ logarithmic _ with the system size @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , let us claim that    @xmath191    with @xmath192 .",
    "this claim receives support from the results shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "( [ fig.excited ] ) , which shows @xmath193 as a function of @xmath3 ( in logarithmic scale ) , for different values of @xmath183 .",
    "notice that all curves are , in fact , parallel straight lines , and the slope is indeed close to @xmath194 .",
    "the additive constant @xmath195 is the only difference , and its decay with @xmath183 is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "( [ fig.excited ] ) . for the @xmath196 case ,",
    "the reduction in the value of the additive constant from the ground state can be explained by assuming a reduced _ effective system size _ , from @xmath3 to @xmath197 , i.e. : @xmath198 .",
    "this reduction in the effective system size can be explained if we assume that it coincides with the _ length of the expected maximal bond_.    the curves @xmath187 for different sizes collapse when the maximum value is substracted from the entropy values and , in the thermodynamic limit , they fit to the finite - size form : @xmath199 where @xmath200 allows us to estimate the size of the region in which entropy grows to reach the value @xmath190 as approximately @xmath154 of the total size of the system .",
    "remarkably , @xmath197 is again the average size of the bond of maximal length , as shown in figure ( [ fig.lmax ] ) .    from all those analysis we can attempt a physical picture of the entanglement in the first excitation .",
    "removal of the weakest bond is usually the same as a removal of the longest bond , which has a typical size @xmath201 .",
    "since bonds can not cross , entanglement can grows normally only _ within _ the region of size @xmath202 which lies under this longest bond .",
    "the region outside , with size @xmath203 , is devoid of long bonds , and contributes less to the entanglement .",
    "similar arguments apply for the higher excitations .",
    "in this work we have analyzed the properties of entanglement in random hopping models , focusing on the similarities between the cft predictions for the clean case and the strong disorder rg predictions .",
    "we have used a combination of exact diagonalization , the dasgupta - ma renormalization scheme and a new tool based on the study of random permutations .",
    "all techniques coincide in providing a compelling image , based on a bond - picture .",
    "all the entanglement properties within the ground state stem from the probability distribution for the bond lengths @xmath0 and an assumption of approximate independence for large bond lengths . both the thermodynamic limit and the finite - size form for the average von neumann entropy can be deduced from the scaling analysis of that distribution function .",
    "the behavior of the rnyi entropies can not be established solely from the bond picture , since the dasgupta - ma rg prediction is that all orders will give the same result .",
    "indeed , we have observed that the parity oscillations which appear in the clean case , according to the cft prediction , attenuate as the disorder grows , making them similar for all values of the rnyi order .",
    "interesting results were obtained for odd chains , where a _ plateau _ appears in the average von neumann entropy , for intermediate system sizes . moreover ,",
    "parity oscillations appear both in the average von neumann entropy of chains with open boundary conditions and in the _ variance _ of the von neumann entropy in all cases .",
    "they fit nicely an expression similar to the cft prediction , but with different constants . remarkably , the scaling of the maximal variance is again logarithmic , but with a different prefactor .",
    "we have introduced the _ random permutation picture _ , which is a simplification of the dasgupta - ma renormalization in which the hoppings are given fixed values which differ broadly in order of magnitude , but are distributed at random among the lattice links .",
    "all the properties of entanglement and correlation in the ground state can be established solely in this picture .",
    "furthermore , we have analysed the average entanglement of excited states .",
    "indeed , excited states are of two types : those which convert a negative energy mode into its corresponding positive energy mode do not alter the bond picture . but excitations which add or remove particles alter them in a remarkable way .",
    "indeed , the average entanglement entropy of the first excitation presents a _ plateau _ at intermediate sizes , whose magnitude scales logarithmically with the size of the system _ as if _ the size of the system corresponds to the average size of the maximal bond .",
    "higher excitations result in a further reduction of the effective size of the system .",
    "there are still many open questions related to this system .",
    "first of all , a thorough analysis of entanglement for intermediate values of the disorder would clarify the decay and convergence of the parity oscillations in the rnyi entropies of all orders .",
    "moreover , it would be interesting to study the system from a dynamical point of view , i.e. : the clean to disorder transition",
