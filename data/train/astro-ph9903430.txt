    "infrared observations of emission line galaxies give access to ions not visible in the optical domain . among those",
    "is the high excitation  line which has not only been observed in active galactic nuclei but also in several starburst galaxies , although at a much fainter level ( genzel  1998 , lutz 1998 , hereafter lkst98 ) .",
    "hot , massive stars generally emit only few ionizing photons with energies above the  edge at 54.42 ev required for the production of .",
    "therefore the origin of this high excitation line in starbursts has been unclear so far .",
    "different excitation mechanisms ( weak agns , super - hot stars , planetary nebulae , and ionizing shocks ) have been discussed by lkst98 . based on simple estimates , photoionization and shock models ,",
    "these authors favor ionizing shocks related to the starburst activity as the most likely explanation for  emission _ in general_.    according to lkst98 , massive super - hot stars remain , however , an option for the high excitation dwarf galaxies included in their sample .",
    "one of these objects ( ngc 5253 ) was studied in more detail by crowther ( 1999 , hereafter c99 ) , who showed , by computing photoionization models around single stars , that wne - w stars can indeed produce strong  and  in surrounding  regions .",
    "the fact that these lines were not prominent in ngc 5253 led them to exclude the possibility of a significant number of such stars being present in this galaxy .",
    "as will be shown below we do not support their conclusion for a variety of reasons .    to shed more light on the origin of the  emission in dwarf galaxies",
    ", we use the information on nebular properties and stellar content derived from optical studies to complement the information from ir data .",
    "in addition to ngc 5253 , we also consider ii zw 40 .",
    "these are the two compact low metallicity galaxies which show the highest excitation among the starbursts observed by lkst98 .",
    "both objects are known as so - called wr galaxies ( cf .",
    "conti 1991 , schaerer  1999b ) , where the presence of broad stellar emission testifying to the presence of wr stars provides powerful constraints on the burst age and massive star content ( e.g.  schaerer et al .",
    "1999a ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present a stellar population model which reproduces the observed stellar features and which , used as an input for photoionization models , explains at the same time the ionization structure of the nebular gas as revealed by the optical and ir fine structure lines .",
    "in the sample of  emitting starbursts of lkst98 , ii zw 40 and ngc 5253 show the strongest excitation ( measured by / ) , the largest  strength ( quantified by ; cf .",
    "lkst98 , fig .",
    "2 ) and stand out by several properties :    * nebular  emission indicative of high excitation is present in the region dominating the optical emission ( walsh & roy 1989 , 1993 , hereafter wr89 ,",
    "wr93 , guseva  1998 ) * a significant number of wolf - rayet stars has been detected in these regions ( kunth & schild 1981 , walsh & roy 1987 , vacca & conti 1992 , schaerer  1997 , hereafter sckm97 ) * in both the dwarf ii zw 40 and the amorphous galaxy ngc 5253 one or few star forming regions of a young age clearly dominate the production of ionizing photons ( vanzi  1996 , beck  1996 , calzetti  1997 ) .    finding 1 ) confirms the presence of high energy photons ( @xmath0 54 ev ) deduced from the ir observations of  and naturally suggests a direct link between the nebular  and  emission .",
    "furthermore the optical observations allow a more precise localisation of the high excitation regions . 1 ) and",
    "2 ) indicate that ii zw 40 and ngc 5253 are objects where the observed  emission is likely due to hot wr stars ( schaerer 1996 , 1997 , 1998 ; de mello  1998 ) .",
    "3 ) justifies , at least to first order , the use of a `` spectral template '' of the brightest starburst region as a representation of the ionizing spectrum of the entire region covered by the iso observations .",
    "wr stars of both wn and wc types have been observed in the two dominant regions of ngc 5253 by sckm97 . in ii zw 40 broad  indicative of wr stars was detected by kunth & sargent ( 1981 ) , vacca & conti ( 1992 ) and guseva  ( 1998 ) .",
    "the latter also detect broad  emission due to wc stars .",
    "the wr and o star content was already analysed by schaerer ( 1996 ) , sckm97 and schaerer  ( 1999a ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig_ihb ] the observed intensities of the various wr features are shown and compared to an instantaneous burst model of schaerer & vacca ( 1998 ) with a salpeter imf at the appropriate metallicity ( z/@xmath1 1/5 ) .",
    "the observations of guseva  ( 1998 ) refer to the entire `` wr bump '' ( 4643 - 4723  ) and represent therefore an upper limit .",
    "shifts in @xmath2 of the theoretical predictions for the wc lines with respect to the observations are not significant since they correspond to very short timescales .",
    "this and other potential uncertainties affecting such a comparison have been extensively discussed in schaerer ( 1999a ) .",
    "figure [ fig_ihb ] shows that all line strengths are reasonably well reproduced by the model . at the corresponding ages of @xmath1 3 - 5 myr ( cf .",
    "sckm97 ) our synthesis model provides therefore a good description of the massive star content in these regions .",
    "the spectral energy distributions predicted by the synthesis models described above have been used as input to the photoionization code _ photo _ ( same version as in stasiska & leitherer 1996 , hereafter sl96 ) .",
    "the remaining input parameters are the total number of stars , the density distribution and the chemical composition here taken as z/=1/4 for easy comparison with sl96 ( the ionization structure of a nebula is insensitive to a small change in the abundances in the gas ) .",
    "following sl96 we calculate sequences of models for a spherical gaz distribution with a uniform hydrogen density @xmath3 and filling factor @xmath4 , both assumed constant during the evolution of the starburst .",
    "for a given age , models with the same ionization parameter @xmath5 have the same ionization structure .",
    "0  is the total number of photons above 13.6 ev , and @xmath6 a function of the electron temperature ( see sl96 ) .",
    "the densities derived in ii zw 40 and ngc 5253 ( @xmath1 70300 @xmath7 , wr89 , wr93 , c99 ) are low enough , so that collisional deexcitation is negligible for the lines of interest .",
    "we therefore explore the parameter space by simply taking @xmath3=10 @xmath7 and @xmath4=1 , and consider three different initial masses for the starburst : @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "these three model sequences will be referred to as the sequence with low , intermediate and high @xmath11 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_ss_1 ] we show the temporal evolution of selected line ratios . unlike c99",
    ", we chose to show line ratios that are independent of the abundances of the parent elements , in order to facilitate comparison with observations of different galaxies . the only exceptions are / and /  when helium is fully ionized in the  region .",
    "also , we limit ourselves to line ratios that involve a dominant ionic stage in the nebula . line ratios like /  or /  as used by genzel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) are difficult to interpret , as the lines are likely emitted by very different regions .    as expected , line ratios from adjacent ionic stages show a progressive decrease of the overall excitation with time for the models we are considering .",
    "helium remains fully ionized up to 4 myr .",
    "notable exceptions to this trend are ,  and , species with the ionization potential at or above the  edge , which appear during a short phase ( at ages @xmath12 3 - 4 myr ) where hot wr stars provide a non - negligible flux above 54 ev ( see schaerer & vacca 1998 ) .",
    "slower temporal changes would of course be obtained for non instantaneous bursts .",
    "it must be noted that those line ratios which are function of the ionization parameter also depend somewhat on the adopted geometry , and this in a non trivial way .",
    "for example , in models with a thin shell geometry , the line ratios shown here differ by factors up to 3 from models for full spheres with the same mean ionization parameter . in the case of the /  ratio",
    ", the value predicted during the wr phase can be smaller by a factor of about 10 since , despite the presence of high energy photons , there is no matter emitting at a high ionization parameter , close to the star cluster .    in the following",
    "we compare the model predictions with observations of ngc 5253 and ii zw 40 .",
    "observed line ratios are overplotted on the model predictions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ss_1 ] .",
    "the optical data is taken from wr89 and wr93 ( region 1 in both objects ) .",
    "ir fluxes for ngc 5253 are taken from genzel  ( 1998 ) , lkst98 , and c99 . for /  a lower limit",
    "is obtained since different iso apertures are involved in the measurements .",
    "all other limits are `` real '' detection limits . adopting the draine ( 1989 ) extinction curve and @xmath13 mag ( c99 ) increases the /  and /  ratios by @xmath1 40 % .",
    "other ir line ratios are much less affected .",
    "c99 consider two separate emission regions to be responsible for the high excitation lines ( e.g.  ) and lower excitation lines respectively ( e.g.  ) .",
    "we see no compelling reason for such a somewhat `` artificial '' separation .",
    "a similar structure is e.g.   naturally obtained in an ideal spherical nebula . instead of using line fluxes corrected for such effects we therefore use the original measurements .",
    "ir line ratios for ii zw 40 are from lkst98 .",
    "we have no access to the acquired iso sws spectra , which should , however , become available soon . from the top panels of figure [ fig_ss_1 ]",
    "it is evident that no single model can reproduce at the same time all the observed line ratios .",
    "this finding is not surprising and may be due to several reasons : 1 ) the structure of the galaxies is more complicated than assumed in the models .",
    "2 ) although one or few bursts of similarly young age dominate the ionizing flux ( sect .",
    "[ s_ass ] ) , the ionizing spectrum is likely not fully described by a single burst population .",
    "3 ) atomic data may be inaccurate .",
    "in particular , the computation of collision strenghts for fine structure transitions is a very delicate problem , and the evaluation of the formal uncertainty is difficult .",
    "a comparison between the plasma diagnostics obtained using different ir and optical lines for the planetary nebula led oliva  ( 1996 ) to suggest that the collision strengths which enter in the calculation of the intensity of  are overestimated by a factor 3 !",
    "similar problems are likely to occur for other fine structure lines .    the /  ratio , which is one of the best studied from all points of view , indicates that , if the age of the starburst lies between 3 and 4 myr , as indicated by the wolf - rayet features , the models with intermediate @xmath11 are the most adequate to represent the two galaxies under study .",
    "at such an age , helium is still completely ionized , because the radiation field is hard enough .",
    "the discrepancy with the measurement of /  in ii zw 40 is likely due to absorption by galactic interstellar sodium intervening at this redshift ( izotov 1999 , private communication ) .",
    "our main result is illustrated in the last three panels of fig .",
    "[ fig_ss_1 ] where we show that during a short phase the stellar population provides enough photons above 54.4 ev to naturally produce the ,  and  lines at levels comparable to the observed ones .",
    "the emission is due to the presence of hot wr stars at ages @xmath12 3 - 4 myr ( cf .",
    "schaerer 1996 , schaerer & vacca 1998 ) . the predicted strength of these lines exceeds even somewhat the observations .",
    "however , this does not invalidate our conclusion .",
    "a more realistic population `` mix '' can easily reconcile the intensity of  with the observations .",
    "as for the  and  lines , they are sensitive to the geometry ( see above ) , which provides ample space for fitting with tailored photoionization models .",
    "this should , however , only be undertaken when the relevant atomic data have been validated by detailed multiwavelength studies of simpler objects and by comparisons with photoionization models .",
    "we propose that  25.9  emission in ngc 5253 and ii zw 40 is due to the presence of hot wr stars observed in both objects .",
    "we draw this conclusion from both empirical and theoretical facts .",
    "first , we note that nebular  and  emission occur simultaneously in these objects .",
    "furthermore a close link between nebular  and wr stars has now been established for the so - called wr galaxies , extra - galactic  regions and the few local group  regions exhibiting this feature ( schaerer 1996 , 1997 , 1998 ; see schaerer  1999b for a catalogue of these objects ) .",
    "second , quantitative models of the stellar populations using up - to - date non - lte atmospheres including stellar winds and the most recent evolutionary tracks are able to explain the observed massive star population and the optical emission lines ( including nebular ) during the wr rich phase ( schaerer 1996 , 1998 ) , even for the lowest metallicity object , ( de mello  1998 , stasiska & schaerer 1999 ) , where such stars were detected recently .",
    "in addition , as demonstrated here , the  emission ( and other ir lines ) is also naturally reproduced by these models .",
    "the two objects considered here are the best available to constrain the origin of  emission : they show the highest excitation , and represent the most simple objects in terms of their ionizing population .",
    "ir observations of the 8 local group ( lg )  regions known to exhibit nebular  ( cf .",
    "garnett  1991 ) can provide a simple `` consistency '' test : the presence of this line is a necessary condition for showing  emission .",
    "the presence or absence of  is , however , also influenced by the ionization parameter and the nebular geometry ( cf .",
    "above ) .",
    "observational evidence suggests that such high excitation  regions occur preferentially at low metallicities .",
    "this holds both for the lg and extragalactic objects ( cf .",
    "schaerer 1997 , 1998 ) , including ii zw 40 and ngc 5253 .",
    "the same can thus be expected for the contribution of wr stars to .",
    "low metallicity may indeed also justify the neglect of line blanketing in the wr models of schmutz  ( 1992 ) included in our synthesis models .",
    "the effects discussed by c99 and crowther ( 1998 ) suppressing the output of photons above the  edge in metal - rich wr models and/or high density winds could well be ineffective at low metallicities , as also suggested by the empirical evidence .",
    "our explanation for the stellar photoionization origin of in dwarf - like low metallicity galaxies can not be necessarily generalised to all the objects of lkst98 .",
    "although indeed 6 out of 14 from their list are known wr `` galaxies '' ( schaerer  1999b ) , it is unlikely that the regions where wr stars are detected contribute a significant fraction of the total ionizing flux in these complex objects .",
    "outflows , weak seyfert activity , and other phenomena are known in some of them and provide alternative explanations as discussed by lkst98 .",
    "more complex models will be required to interpret such objects , to provide an theoretical understanding of new empirical ir diagnostic diagrams ( cf .",
    "genzel  1998 ) , and to assess the contribution of stellar sources to high energy photons .",
