    "the large area telescope ( atwood et al . 2009 ) on - board the _ fermi _ satellite discovered the huge @xmath10-ray structures , the so - called fermi bubbles .",
    "they extend north and south centering on the galactic center for about 5 kpc in each direction , with a longitudinal width @xmath2 40@xmath11 ( dobler et al .",
    "2010 ; su et al . 2010 ; ackermann et al .",
    "it has been suggested that these bubbles have relatively sharp edges ( with an angular width of @xmath0 3.4@xmath11@xmath12 ) and are symmetric with respect to the galactic plane and the minor axis of the galactic disk .",
    "large - scale structures which may be associated with the @xmath10-ray fermi bubbles are also known in other wavelengths .",
    "the wmap haze , known as the microwave excess and characterized by a flat - spectrum is spatially correlated with the @xmath10-ray bubbles at @xmath13@xmath5@xmath13 @xmath4 @xmath14@xmath3 . in x - rays ,",
    "the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) provides all - sky images in the 0.5@xmath62.0 kev range ( snowden et al .",
    "possible signatures related with the north bubble can be seen in the rosat map ( e.g. , su et al . 2010 , figs .",
    "18 & 19 therein ) , together with two sharp edges in the south that seem to trace the fermi bubble below the galactic disk ( e.g. , fig . 1 in wang 2002 ; fig . 6 in bland - hawthorn & cohen 2003 ; also , figs .",

    ", we can see the the north polar spur ( nps ) which is the large - scale soft x - ray enhancement corresponding with a part of the radio loop i structure .",
    "several authors argued that the nps and the loop i may be related to the wind activity of the scorpio - centaurus ob association at a distance of 170 pc ( egger & aschenbach 1995 ) or may be a nearby supernova remnant ( berkhuijsen et al . 1971 ) .",
    "in contrast , sofue ( 2000 , and references therein ) asserted that the nps is a large - scale outflow from the gc and with a total energy of @xmath2 10@xmath15@xmath610@xmath16 erg released on a timescale of @xmath2 10@xmath17 yr .",

    "( 2013 ; paper - i herein ) carried out _ suzaku _ x - ray observations of high - galactic latitude regions ( 43@xmath11 @xmath18 54@xmath11 ) positioned across the north - east and the southern - most edges of the fermi bubbles in an ao7 program in 2012 . in all pointings , they found diffuse x - ray emission that was well - reproduced by a three - component spectral model consisting of unabsorbed thermal emission ( temperature @xmath19kev ) from the local hot bubble ( lhb ) , absorbed @xmath20kev thermal emission related to the galactic halo ( gh ) , and a power - law component at a level consistent with the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) . the emission measure ( em ) of the 0.3kev plasma decreases by @xmath21 toward the inner regions of the north - east bubble without a notable temperature change ( in this context , see also fujita et al .",
    "they argued that the presence of a large amount of neutral matter absorbing the x - ray emission as well as the existence of the @xmath20kev gas can be naturally interpreted as a weak shock driven by the bubbles expansion in the surrounding medium with velocity @xmath22kms@xmath23 compressing the gh gas to form the nps feature .",
    "also they suggested that the pressure and energy of the non - thermal plasma filling the bubbles are in a rough equilibrium with that of the thermal plasma surrounding the bubbles .    following paper - i",
    ", we started a new project proposing a sequence of x - ray observations and systematic analysis of archival data provided by _",

    "four _ suzaku _ observations were conducted as part of an ao8 program in 2013 with a total ( requested ) duration of 80 ksec .",
    "these observations were motivated by the recent finding by the monitor of all - sky x - ray image ( maxi ; matsuoka et al .",
    "2009 ) solid - state slit camera ( ssc ; tsunemi et al .",
    "2010 ) of two prominent x - ray structures in the northernmost and southeast regions of the bubbles , as detailed below .",
    "the new maxi - ssc images and _ suzaku _ observations are described in section 2 .",
    "the analysis of diffuse x - ray emission for the ao8 observations data and the archival _ suzaku _ and _ swift _ data is given in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we discuss a possible scenario accounting for the obtained results .",
    "the maxi mission is the first astronomical payload installed on the japanese experiment module - exposed facility ( jem - ef or kibo - ef ) on the international space station ( iss ) .",
    "maxi scans almost the entire ( 90% ) sky twice in every iss orbit ( @xmath2 90 minutes ) .",
    "maxi carries two detectors  the gas slit camera ( gsc ; mihara et al .",
    "2011 ) and the aforementioned ssc . given the spectral resolution of its x - ray ccd , all - sky x - ray images in the energy range of 0.5@xmath612 kev can be generated with the maxi - ssc with a field of view of 1.5@xmath3 @xmath26 90@xmath3 .",
    "the ssc is one of the best instruments to study large diffuse x - ray structures as recently demonstrated in a study of the cygnus superbubble ( kimura et al .",
    "2013 ) .    while a detailed x - ray spectral study of the fermi bubbles using the maxi - ssc data is ongoing , all - sky maps in various x - ray energy bands have been prepared for various uses .",
    "figure 1 shows the x - ray sky maps obtained with the maxi - ssc taken from 2009 august 18 to 2012 february 01 in the low - band ( l - band = 0.7@xmath61.7 kev : @xmath27-@xmath28 ) and mid - band ( m - band = 1.7@xmath64.0 kev : @xmath27-@xmath29 ) ( kimura et al . 2013 ) .",
    "these maps are exposure - time corrected , while no background is subtracted . whereas the global structure seen in the l - band image",
    "is essentially consistent with the rosat all - sky maps taken at 0.75 and 1.5 kev ( snowden et al . 1995 ) , the m - band image shows prominent structures which are unseen in the l - band image .",
    "specifically , we found a `` cap '' or clump - like structure appearing at the northernmost part of the fermi bubble at high galactic latitudes 45@xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath4 55@xmath3 ( hereafter , n - cap ) .",
    "also there appears to be a nps - like feature visible to the southeast in the l - band image .",

    "these new all - sky maps from maxi - ssc motivated us to obtain follow - up observations using _ suzaku _ as detailed below .",
    "_ suzaku _ is suitable for investigating such faint diffuse x - ray emission because of its low instrumental background and superior energy resolution especially below 1 kev .      as a part of an ao8 program in 2013 , we carried out four _ suzaku _ observations of @xmath0 20 ksec each , pointed `` on '' and `` off '' the ( i ) n - cap and ( ii ) se - claw regions ( fig .",
    "1 ) with a total ( requested ) duration of 80 ksec .",

    "observation logs and pointing positions are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the _ suzaku _ satellite ( mitsuda et al .",
    "2007 ) is equipped with four x - ray telescopes ( xrt ; serlemitsos et al .",
    "2007 ) , each carrying a focal - plane x - ray ccd camera ( x - ray imaging spectrometer , xis ; koyama et al . 2007 ) .",
    "one of the xis sensors is a back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd ( xis1 ) , and the other three xis sensors are front - illuminated ( fi ) ones ( xis0 , xis2 , and xis3 ) . because the operation of xis2 ceased in 2006 november due to contamination by a leaked charge , we use only the other three ccds .",
    "the xis was operated in the normal full - frame clocking mode with the 3 @xmath26 3 or 5 @xmath26 5 editing mode .",
    "although _ suzaku _ also carries a hard x - ray detector ( takahashi et al .",
    "2007 ) , we do not use the data collected by its pin and gso instruments because the thermal emission we describe below is too faint to be detected at 10 kev and no statistically significant excesses over the cxb were found with these pin / gso detectors .",
    "the lower panels of figure 1 show our _ suzaku _ xis fields of view ( fovs ; @xmath2 18 @xmath26 18 ) onto the maxi - ssc image for the series of northernmost and southeast observations of the bubbles .",
    "green and white circles denote our previous ao7 pointings as published in paper - i and our newly obtained ao8 pointings , respectively , while yellow dashed curves indicate the boundary of the fermi bubbles as drawn by su et al .",
    "note that in the n - cap region , there are some regions with previous _ suzaku _ pointings and the corresponding focal centers of these observations are denoted in the figure by cyan circles ; the analysis of these archival data are discussed below .",
    "we conducted all data reduction and analysis with headas software version 6.14 using the calibration database ( caldb ) released on 2013 august 13 .",
    "first , we combined the cleaned event data of the two editing modes using xselect . the data corresponding to epochs of low - earth elevation angles ( less than 20@xmath11 during both night and day )",
    "were then excised , as well periods when the _ suzaku _ satellite was passing through ( and 500 sec after ) the south atlantic anomaly .",
    "moreover , we also excluded the data obtained when the _ suzaku _ satellite was passing through the low cut - off rigidity ( cor ) of below 6 gv .",
    "finally , hot and flickering pixels were removed using sisclean ( day et al .",
    "1998 ) . with these data",
    "selection criteria applied , the resulting total effective exposures for all the observed pointings are summarized in table 1 .      because the bi ccd ( xis1 ) has higher instrumental background than those of fi ccds , we extracted the xis images from only the two fi ccds ( xis0 , xis3 ) .",
    "we made the xis images in three photon energy ranges of 0.4@xmath610 kev , 0.4@xmath62 kev , and 2@xmath610 kev . in the image analysis ,",
    "calibration sources located at the corners of the ccd chips were excluded .",
    "the images of non x - ray background ( nxb ) were obtained from the night earth data using xisnxbgen ( tawa et al . 2008 ) . since the exposure times for the data toward the n - cap and se - claw ( original data ) were different from that of the nxb , we corrected for the differences in the exposure times using xisexpmapgen ( ishisaki et al .",
    "2007 ) before subtracting them from the original images .",
    "in addition , we implemented a vignetting correction by simulating flat sky images with xissim ( ishisaki et al .",
    "the xis0 and xis3 images were then combined , re - binned by a factor of 4 ( i.e. , 4 pixels were combined to 1 ) , then smoothed by a gaussian function with @xmath31 = 0.07 ( gaussian kernel radius set as 8 in ds9 ) , and the resultant images are presented in section 3 .    with the combined xis0 + 3 images , we first ran the source detection algorithm in ximage ( giommi et al .",
    "1992 ) to differentiate compact x - ray features from diffuse x - ray emission . through this approach ,",
    "bright compact emitters which are not associated with catalogued sources were detected ( all at approximately @xmath32 ) .",
    "we used all the ( fi and bi ) ccds , namely , xis0 , 1 , 3 for the spectral analysis to increase the photon statistics . regarding the bright compact x - ray features described above , we defined the source regions as 2 radius circles centered on the emission peaks , and the corresponding background regions were set to annuli on the same ccd chips with inside and outside radii of 2 and 4 , respectively .",
    "we made redistribution matrix files ( rmfs ) and auxiliary response files ( arfs ) using xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen ( ishisaki et al .",
    "2007 ) , respectively .",
    "for the diffuse emission analysis , we set the source region to the whole ccd chip which remained after excluding all the compact features detected at significance levels above 3@xmath31 , with typical 2 radius circles which is sufficient to avoid contamination from the compact sources . using xissimarfgen and new contamination files ( released on 2013 august 13 ) ,",
    "the arf files were created assuming the uniform extension of the diffuse emission within 20 radii orbicular regions ( giving the arf area of 0.35 deg@xmath33 ) .",
    "as opposed to the point source analysis , we subtracted as background , the nxb data obtained from the region in the same ccd chip .",
    "we note that even though the most recent version of xissimarfgen replicates well the deterioration of the ccd quantum efficiency below 2 kev , significant differences in the spectral shape of the measured emission continua between xis 0 , 1 , and 3 were found below @xmath0 0.5 kev due to contamination .",
    "hence we ignored the spectral data below 0.6 kev for xis 0 and 3 , and below 0.5 kev for xis 1 .",
    "we also did not use the high energy data above 8 kev for all ccds due to low photon statistics .",
    "although we constructed light curves for bright x - ray compact features , none of them suggested any significant variability within the short exposures obtained .",
    "figure 2 shows the obtained 0.4@xmath610 kev _ suzaku_-xis images ( combined xis0 and 3 ) for the n - cap field ( n - cap_on / off ) and the se - claw field ( se_on / off ) .",
    "note the bright features seen in the images near the corners of the ccd chips are spurious sources resulting from instrumental artifacts , which were excluded in the spectral analysis .",
    "although the pointing positions are only @xmath02@xmath3 apart in the se - claw , we can see that the surface brightness of the inner bubble ( se_on ) is much higher than that of the se_off , with on - off flux differences being as large as @xmath2 10@xmath31 .",
    "in contrast , such large variations in surface brightness are not clearly seen in the n - cap regions .    in the figures ,",
    "magenta crosses show the positions of compact x - ray features detected at @xmath32 level which are probably associated with catalogued background sources from the ned and simbad databases .",
    "the other compact features detected here with _ suzaku _ at high significances that miss any identifications in these databases are named src1@xmath65and indicated as red circles in figure 2 . given the limited photon statistics and the relatively large psf of the xis , it is difficult to determine whether the detected compact features are point - like or extended . in this context , it is important to estimate the expected number of background active galactic nuclei ( agn ) likely to be found within each xis fov .",
    "following stawarz et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , we estimate that two or three uncatalogued agn are present within each xis fov , corresponding to the number of detected compact x - ray features without any optical identification in the present data . in order to investigate the possible associations with background agn",
    ", we looked into the available mid - infrared ( mir ) maps of the areas covered by our _ suzaku _ exposures using the nasa widefield infrared survey explorer ( wise ; wright et al .",
    "2010 ) satellite data . as a result",
    ", we found just one wise counterpart ( indicated as a black cross in figure 2 ) which was thus excluded in the spectral analysis described below .        using xspec , we fitted the spectra of all the compact x - ray features which were detected at significance levels above @xmath32 and have no matches in the ned , simbad and wise databases . within the given photon statistics ,",
    "the x - ray spectra were all well - represented by single power - law models moderated by galactic absorption . although the nature of these sources are unclear ( as there were no apparent matches in the ned , simbad and wise databases ) , they are likely faint background agn considering the estimate above .",
    "their fitted spectral parameters vary widely with a range of photon spectral indices @xmath34 from 1.2 to 4.4 and unabsorbed 2@xmath610 kev fluxes ( 0.2@xmath63.5 ) @xmath26 10@xmath35 erg@xmath23 @xmath36 s@xmath23 , albeit with large uncertainties . in the following , we regard these point - like sources as most likely unrelated to the diffuse gh structure , and excluded them in the diffuse x - ray emission analysis .",
    "+      we regarded the whole ccd chip as a source region after excluding all the compact features mentioned above , without regard to whether or not they were previously catalogued x - ray sources .",
    "we can fit the diffuse spectra of all the _ suzaku _ data with the same three component model , apec1 + wabs * ( apec2 + pl ) , as done in paper - i ( apec : an emission from collisionally - ionized diffuse gas , wabs : a photo - electric absorption , pl ; a single power law ) .",
    "in other words , the model consists of an unabsorbed thermal component apec1 corresponding to the local hot bubble ( lhb ) emission and/or contamination from the solar - wind charge exchange ( swcx ; fujimoto et al . 2007 ) , an absorbed thermal component apec2 corresponding to the gh , and an absorbed single power - law component pl due to the isotropic cxb radiation . with regard to the absorbed component , we fixed the neutral hydrogen column density at the galactic value @xmath37 corresponding to the direction of each pointing ( see table 2 ) , while we fixed the photon index for the cxb component at @xmath38 = 1.41 ( kushino et al .",
    "we also carried out the spectral fitting where @xmath39 was left free and derived their ratios relative to the galactic values , @xmath39 /@xmath37 ( table 2 ) .",
    "one can see that the values in the southeast are either consistent with or even larger than unity within the statistical errors . however , in the n - cap pointings ( i.e. , n - cap_on / off ) the relatively low photon statistics only provided upper limits . following paper - i and the other literature ( willingale et al . 2003 ; miller et al . 2008 ; yao & wang 2005 ; yao et al . 2009 , 2010 )",
    ", we fixed the temperature and abundance of the lhb plasma at _ kt _ = 0.1 kev and _ z _ = _ z_@xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the existence of the _ kt _ @xmath0 0.1 kev component related to lhb / swcx is verified by the past _ suzaku _ and xmm observations of 12 and 26 pointings , respectively ( yoshino et al .",
    "2009 ; henley et al .",
    "2010 ; henley & shelton 2013 ) .",
    "the results of the spectral fitting are shown in figure 3 and summarized in table 2 .    to interpret the ovii ( 574 ev ) emission especially below 0.7 kev",
    "the _ kt _ @xmath0 0.1 kev component ( apec1 ) is still important , while the measured continua are dominated by the absorbed thermal component ( apec2 ) below 2 kev .",
    "we investigated the metallicity of this component by fitting the stacked spectra of the n - cap and se - claw regions and found that their metallicities are _ z _ = 0.075 @xmath41 _ z_@xmath40 and 0.717 @xmath42 _ z_@xmath40 , respectively .",
    "it appears that the metallicity in the se - claw is higher than that in the n - cap , and even higher than that reported in paper - i ( average of @xmath0 0.2 _ z_@xmath40 at 42@xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath4 48@xmath3 ) .",
    "this may suggest an actual decrease in the metallicity at increasing galactic latitudes , but this is inconclusive with the data in hand due to the relatively poor photon statistics .",
    "we fixed the metallicity of each area at the corresponding value .",
    "meanwhile , the x - ray spectra above 2 kev are dominated by the power - law component . assuming the isotropy of this emission , the pl intensity at 2@xmath610 kev is approximately consistent with the absolute intensity of the cxb , namely ( 5.85 @xmath7 0.38 ) @xmath26 10@xmath43 erg @xmath36 s@xmath23 sr@xmath23 , as determined by kushino et al . (",
    "2002 ) as an average of 91 observation fields , assuming a power - law model with a photon index @xmath44 . as shown in table 2 ,",
    "at least at the level well exceeding cxb intensity fluctuations , an excess non - thermal emission component related to the fermi bubbles is not seen .",
    "although the derived intensities seem rather lower than the absolute value determined by kushino et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , this is naturally expected from the large - scale fluctuation of the cxb itself as concluded in kushino et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and also demonstrated by yoshino et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "as seen in table 2 , the gh component ( apec2 ) temperatures of n - cap_on / off and se_on / off are almost identical ( _ kt _ = 0.30 @xmath7 0.05 kev ) . comparing the fitted parameters of se_on to those of se_off , the em of apec2 increases by a factor of @xmath45 2 , while a similar increase was not seen in the em across the n - cap",
    "although the em in the n - cap appears rather to decrease between the n - cap_off to n - cap_on regions , it can be naturally expected that the em becomes smaller as galactic latitude increases because the em describes the amount of material along the line - of - sight . in order to check the plasma temperature of _ kt _ @xmath0 0.3 kev near the n - cap , we investigated the spectra of five other _ suzaku _",

    ", we showed that the diffuse x - ray emission which remained after excluding all compact x - ray features detected at @xmath32 level , was well - represented by a three - component plasma model consisting of unabsorbed thermal emission from the local hot bubble , absorbed thermal emission related to the galactic halo , and a @xmath47 1.4 power - law component expected from the cosmic x - ray background .",
    "the temperature of the gh component , @xmath9 @xmath0 0.3 kev , seen in both n - cap_on / off and se_on / off is consistent with that reported in paper - i .",
    "the em of the gh component changes substantially , dropping by about a factor of 2.5 from the se_on to se_off regions which are only 2@xmath3 apart in the se - claw .",
    "a similar variation was also seen in the northeast area data presented in paper  i. in contrast , such an increase in the em of the @xmath9 @xmath0 0.3 kev plasma is not seen in the n - cap .    in figures 7 & 8 ,",
    "we plot 1.7@xmath64.0 kev count rates and temperature _ kt _ of the gh component in the n - cap against galactic latitude ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "figure 7 includes the data for our new ao8 pointings ( n - cap_on / off ) , the previous ao7 pointings ( paper i ; n1 - 8 ) , and also the archival _ suzaku _ pointings ( n - cap1 - 5 ) . figure 8 includes the data for the archival _ swift _ observation pointings ( swift1 - 19 ) .",
    "one can see that the temperature of the gh component is uniform at @xmath9 @xmath0 0.30 @xmath7 0.05 kev , consistent with the finding presented in paper - i .",

    "this may suggest that the excess emission is due to the presence of an _ additional _ plasma component , having much higher temperature .    assuming the additional higher temperature plasma component",
    ", we generated a spectrum by stacking three regions showing excess counts in 1.7@xmath64.0 kev .",
    "as shown in fig .",

    "the `` hotter '' plasma may be formed via a termination shock .",
    "in fact , similarly weak shocks were generally found in some radio galaxies residing in cluster and group environments , such as in ngc  3801 ( croston et al .",
    "2007 ) , b2  0838 + 32a ( jetha et al . 2008 ) , hcg  62 ( gitti et al . 2010 ) , ngc  5813 ( randall et al . 2011 ) , 4c  + 29.30 ( siemiginowska et al .",
    "2012 ) , 3c  452 ( shelton et al .",
    "2011 ) , and pks  b1358 - 113 ( stawarz et al . 2014 ) .",
    "together with our finding in paper - i , it appears that there is a ubiquitous diffuse @xmath9 @xmath0 0.3 kev thermal plasma ( modeled by apec2 ) within a central region of galactic longitude @xmath13@xmath1@xmath13 @xmath4 @xmath24@xmath3 and latitude @xmath13@xmath5@xmath13 @xmath4 @xmath25@xmath3 .",
    "such an isothermal plasma may be virialized and only weakly heated from the ubiquitous 0.2 kev value to 0.3 kev within the galactic halo and hence irrelevant to the fermi bubbles .",
    "however , the positional coincidence of prominent structures , like the nps , the n - cap , and se - claw seems to support the idea that they are all related to the formation of the fermi bubbles .",
    "we believe similar hot plasma and enhanced structures like nps and n - cap could be observed also in the south , but too faint to be detected in the current instruments onboard maxi / suzaku .",
    "in fact , one see a counter - part of nps denoted as south polar spur ( sps ) , as described in detail in sofue et al .",
    "the fact that these south structures are considerably fainter than those in the north may suggest ( 1 ) asymmetric outflow due to different environmental condition and/or ( 2 ) the axis of the fermi bubbles may be leaning from perpendicular to the galactic disk ( kataoka et al . in prep ) .    assuming that the 0.3 kev plasma is heated by a shock driven by the bubbles expansion in the surrounding halo , the corresponding velocity is @xmath50 @xmath2 300 km s@xmath23 and shock mach number @xmath51 ( paper i ) .",
    "this is consistent with the recent finding of a non - thermal velocity in the x - ray absorption line toward 3c  273 whose sightline passes through the neighborhood of the fermi bubbles ( fang & jiang 2014 ) .",
    "such a low expansion velocity is actually expected in some theoretical models ( e.g. , crocker et al .",
    "2014 , fujita et al .",
    "2014 , mou et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , but see also , guo & mathews 2012 , guo et al .",
    "2012 , lacki 2014 ) . specifically , using hydrodynamical simulations , mou et al .",
    "( 2014 ) argued that the plasma temperature around the fermi bubbles is @xmath9 @xmath0 0.3 kev in the model that the bubbles were inflated by winds launched from the past hot accretion flow in sgr a@xmath52 .",
    "moreover , fig . 1 in mou et al .",
    "( 2014 ) implies that the temperature of thermal plasma can be a bit higher at the outermost regions of the bubbles ( i.e. , at high galactic latitudes ) than at lower galactic latitudes , possibly reflecting the positional difference of expanding velocity near the bow - shock region .",
    "this is qualitatively similar to what we observed in the `` n - cap '' in this paper .",
    "further extensive studies using the new maxi - ssc data and more extensive use of archival x - ray observations are now ongoing and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we are grateful to the referee for the useful comments helped the improvement of the paper .",
