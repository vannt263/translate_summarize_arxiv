    "the study of dissipation and decoherence is a central problem in the description of solid state systems both from the fundamental and the applicative point of view .",
    "one of the most popular models , employed to describe dissipation , is the one introduced by caldeira and leggett  @xcite in which the dissipative environment is a bath of harmonic oscillators whose fluctuations obey gaussian statistics , linearly coupled to the system under consideration  @xcite .",
    "while this model is reasonable to describe the dissipation induced by large environments , such as equilibrium fermi reservoirs , it is becoming clear that possible sources of decoherence do not necessarily fall into this category for nanodevices such as quantum dots and qubits .",
    "solid state nanocircuits typically suffer from discrete noise , often originated from background charge fluctuations .",
    "single / few impurities behaving either like random telegraph noise sources  @xcite or being entangled with the device have been recently observed  @xcite in different setups .",
    "the resulting non - gaussian effects can only be predicted introducing non - linear bath models  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the excellent control recently achieved in circuit - qed experiments  @xcite has paved the way to the observation of quantum effects originating from the coupling of multilevel nanodevices to a single harmonic mode of a high - q cavity resulting in a effective bath having a structured power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "all these mechanisms deviate from the canonical caldeira and leggett description and are examples of unconventional dissipative baths .",
    "the coupling to an unconventional dissipative bath arises also in the case of a nanoresonator coupled to a quantum dot , where electrons are coupled to few or even a single phonon mode  @xcite .",
    "an experimental realization of such a system is the phonon cavity studied by weig _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", the coupling to the single bath mode induces sizable effects on the transport properties of the dot , with the appearance of peaks in the conductance spectrum when the energy of tunneling electrons matches the energy of the phonon mode .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs in a oscillating c@xmath0 molecule contacted by gold leads  @xcite .",
    "often , in these cases both the leads bath and the localized bath mode are assumed to be in their thermal equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "however , there are several situations in which this assumption is not justified especially for the localized mode .",
    "for example , in suspended carbon nanotubes , the electrons are coupled with a single longitudinal stretching  @xcite , or to a radial breathing  @xcite phonon mode .",
    "unconventional _ single mode bath is driven out of equilibrium by the electron current and it induces the appearance of peculiar negative differential conductance traces  @xcite .",
    "another example is that of the superconducting single electron transistor coupled to a single  mode nanoresonator studied by naik _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , where the back  action exerted by the single electron transistor cools down the phonon mode below the temperature of the environment .",
    "then , it may be necessary to treat the leads and the single mode on a different footing .",
    "while the leads degrees of freedom can be assumed in their thermal equilibrium and are traced out in the usual way , the coupled dynamics of the electrons and the localized boson is treated without assuming _ a priori _ a distribution for the localized mode .",
    "such a issue will be the subject of investigation in this work",
    ". we will consider a spin degenerate single level quantum dot with finite coulomb repulsion coupled to two external environments :    ( @xmath1 ) a pair of fermi leads , described by a standard caldeira leggett model ,    ( @xmath2 ) an unconventional _ non  relaxed _ single phonon bath .",
    "the transport properties of such a system have been theoretically analyzed both in the sequential tunneling and in the cotunneling regime  @xcite .",
    "the behavior strongly differs with respect to the one obtained for a system coupled to an equilibrated localized phonon mode  @xcite . in the sequential tunneling regime , besides the negative differential conductance mentioned above , the zero  frequency shot noise @xmath3 has been found to be even more sensitive to the bath properties  @xcite . in the case of strong coupling to an out of equilibrium phonon bath , a super  poissonian shot noise @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the electron charge , @xmath6 the corresponding current ) has been predicted  @xcite . on the other hand , for a thermal bath , sub ",
    "poissonian shot noise @xmath7 is always found  @xcite . in the cotunneling regime ,",
    "vibrational absorption sidebands occur within the coulomb  blockaded regime , which disappear for the case of a single bath in thermal equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "this further confirms the importance of such a unequilibrated phonon bath to describe experimental systems .    in order to consider the coherent dynamics of the quantum dot with the single mode bath one can derive a generalized master equation within",
    "markov approximation for the reduced density matrix of the system _ and _ the localized bath , by tracing out the leads bath .",
    "such an approach has been employed already in the past for describing systems such as a metallic  @xcite or a superconducting single electron transistor  @xcite .",
    "since the transport properties have been already studied in great details , we will concentrate on the steady state out of equilibrium _ phonon distribution _ of the bath ( @xmath2 ) induced by the tunneling electrons , which in the past has received much less attention  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will analyze the phonon fano factor @xmath8 defined as the ratio between the variance of the phonon occupation number @xmath9 and the average occupation number @xmath10 .",
    "the fano factor brings information about the statistics of the single phonon bath mode . for a thermally equilibrated bath ,",
    "one always obtains a super  poissonian fano factor @xmath11 .",
    "such a super  poissonian value is typical for `` classical '' boson distributions , as for example for photons in classical light  @xcite .",
    "as it will be shown later , in most of the transport regimes , out of equilibrium bath distributions arise which , although being strongly different from a thermal distribution , display a super  poissonian character .",
    "however , it is possible to find particular transport regimes in which @xmath12 , corresponding to peculiar bath distributions  @xcite .",
    "this case is analogous to that of the reduced photon fluctuation found in quantum non ",
    "classical radiation  @xcite .",
    "our main results are the following . in the regime where the single bath mode oscillations are much faster than the average electron dwell time",

    "poissonian bath as a function of tunnel barriers asymmetry and coupling strength with the bath mode , finding that @xmath12 is destroyed for increasing damping of the single mode bath .",
