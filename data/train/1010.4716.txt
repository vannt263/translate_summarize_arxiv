    "notice that in writing eq .  , we omitted the diamagnetic term @xmath33 which is quadratic in the magnetic field and of the order of @xmath34 .",
    "as the mie frequency typically lies in the optical range , and @xmath35 , we have @xmath36 , even for the highest presently achievable static magnetic fields of several tens of teslas .",
    "thus , the diamagnetic term represents a small correction to the single - particle confinement , which is proportional to @xmath37 . in the sequel we work to first order in the small parameter @xmath38 .      a monochromatic electric field of ( complex ) amplitude @xmath39 and frequency @xmath40 can be used to excite the electronic system . in the long - wavelength limit , the coupling to such an electric field is described by the hamiltonian @xmath41 this field only couples to the electronic center of mass .",

    "the decomposition is reminiscent of the well - studied case where the degree of freedom of interest ( in our case , the electronic center of mass ) is coupled to a large reservoir or environment ( the relative coordinates ) . @xcite the interaction with the reservoir leads to the dissipation of the collective coordinate energy .",

    "therefore , the relative orientation of the laser polarization and the external magnetic field allow one to selectively excite the different collective modes .",
    "the hamiltonian is similar to the one encountered in the context of quasi - two - dimensional semiconductor quantum dots .",
