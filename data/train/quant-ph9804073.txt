    "in 1952 david bohm @xcite proposed a new interpretation of quantum mechanics connecting `` classical '' trajectories to particles with a space - time probability distribution given by the full solution of the time dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "a detailed presentation of this interpretation may be found for instance in @xcite , whereas its historical contingency is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the main points of his interpretation , which are of concern here , may be described as follows ( for simplicity the space dimension is taken to be @xmath4 and units @xmath5 are used ) .",
    "let @xmath6 be the solution of the time dependent schrdinger equation for a certain system , that is @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the hamilton operator of the system .",
    "then one decomposes @xmath9 in its absolute value and the corresponding phase which results in @xmath10\\ ] ] the phase @xmath11 determines the `` classical '' motion by requiring that the momentum of a particle at position @xmath12 at time @xmath0 is given by @xmath13 solving ( [ p - def ] ) for a particle with initial position @xmath14 at time @xmath15 attributes to this particle a classical trajectory @xmath16 subject to the initial condition @xmath17 .",
    "obviously one may use these trajectories to transport the probability distribution @xmath18 in time by moving the initial distribution at points @xmath14 to the points @xmath19 , which is suggested by bohm s interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "of course this transport in time can not be the complete procedure since the normalization condition of the probability distribution must be maintained too . in the next section",
    "it will be shown how one can reconstruct the probability distribution @xmath1 from the initial one , @xmath20 , by using classical trajectories , the solutions of ( [ p - def ] ) , and that the result agrees with the usual quantum mechanical one , namely @xmath21",
    "let the probability distribution at time @xmath2 be ( @xmath22 is chosen to be @xmath23 for simplicity ) @xmath24 this is the continuous analogue of particles distributed at points @xmath14 with some probability @xmath25 . according to bohm s interpretation the points @xmath14 move to the points @xmath16 in time and therefore following this idea the probability distribution at time t must be given by @xmath26 where @xmath16 is the solution of ( [ p - def ] ) with the appropriate initial condition . from ( [ rho_time ] )",
    "it is easy to obtain the wanted result because the integration can be done without difficulty by means of the @xmath27-function .",
    "the zero of the @xmath27-function is given by @xmath28 , the inverse function to @xmath16 .",
    "this gives , using differentiation rules for inverse functions , @xmath29 and the final result is @xmath30 that this result , obtained by using bohm s interpretation of quantum mechanics , agrees with the usual quantum mechanical result ( [ usual_quant ] ) can be shown as follows .",
    "together with the current density @xmath31 @xmath32 as defined in ( [ rho_time ] ) fulfills the continuity equation @xmath33 but @xmath34 , due to the momentum definition ( [ p - def ] ) , can also be written in the form @xmath35 thus @xmath32 fulfills the same continuity equation as @xmath1 defined in ( [ usual_quant ] ) . at time @xmath2",
    "both agree , if @xmath36 is chosen to be @xmath37 the uniqueness of the solution of the continuity equation implies then that @xmath38 this shows that the reconstruction of the probability distribution at time @xmath39 following bohm s ideas agrees with the usual quantum mechanical result and the explicit expression is given by ( [ rho_final ] ) .",
    "but the imagination that the probability distribution at time @xmath0 ist just obtained by the flow of particles from the initial distribution following the trajectories @xmath16 is in general wrong due to the factor @xmath40 in ( [ rho_final ] ) .",
    "this factor could also be interpreted as a normalization factor since due to it the normalization of the wave function is valid for all times @xmath41 the next section will show the role of this factor within three different examples explicitly .",
    "the normalized coherent state with amplitude @xmath42 is given by ( @xmath43 ) @xmath44 -\\frac{1}{2}\\left [ x - d\\cos t\\right ] ^{2}\\right\\}\\ ] ] which gives for the absolute value @xmath45 and the phase factor @xmath11@xmath46   \\\\ s(x , t ) & = & -\\frac{t}{2}+\\frac{d^{2}}{4}\\sin 2t - dx\\sin t\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the definition of the momentum one obtains therefore @xmath47 resulting in the equation of motion @xmath48 with the solution @xmath49 from this the inverse function is given by @xmath50 and therefore @xmath51 as expected since a coherent state does not change its shape in time . obviously the reconstructed probability distribution agrees with the quantum mechanical result as it has to be @xmath52 \\longrightarrow   \\\\ \\rho ( x_{0}(x , t),0 ) & = & \\frac{1}{\\pi ^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\exp \\left\\{-\\left[x_{0}(x , t)-d\\right]^{2}\\right\\}=r(x , t)^{2 }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the normalized wave function for a free particle with a gaussian distribution around @xmath53 at time @xmath2 and for which the peak of the probability distribution moves with constant velocity ( here taken to be one ) in time is given by @xmath54\\ ] ] from this the absolute value and the phase of the wave function are given by @xmath55{\\left ( t^{2}+1\\right ) \\pi } } \\exp \\left[-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{% \\left ( t - x\\right ) ^{2}}{t^{2}+1}\\right]\\ ] ] @xmath56 with the corresponding `` classical '' momentum @xmath57 the equation of motion @xmath58 has the solution @xmath59 whose inverse is given by @xmath60 and @xmath61 which is just the right factor to correct the normalization for the broadening of the wave packet in time .",
    "again one obtains complete agreement with bohm s interpretation @xmath62=r(x , t)^{2 }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one may be tempted to interpret the factor @xmath63 to be responsible only for the normalization of the wave function without any relation to its shape . that this imagination is completely wrong",
    "will be shown in the last example .      instead of a coherent state a superposition of the ground state with the first excited state of the harmonic oscillator",
    "is considered .",
    "the time dependent solution for this case is given by @xmath64\\ ] ] and therefore @xmath65 @xmath66 proceeding in the usual way one has therefore to solve the differential equation @xmath67 which has the implicit solution @xmath68 one can numerically extract from this implicit solution @xmath16 or the inverse @xmath69 and compare the exact result @xmath1 with the result obtained from using `` classical '' trajectories but without the factor @xmath70 , that is with @xmath71 only .",
    "this is shown in fig . 1 for the time @xmath72 ( for simplicity the square roots are plotted , that is @xmath45 and @xmath73 ) .",
    "the disagreement in shape is obvious , but full agreement is achieved if the factor @xmath74 is taken into account .",
    "it has been shown that bohm s interpretation of quantum mechanics gives the correct answer for the probability distribution at later times when applied to the probability distribution of a system at time @xmath75 .",
    "of course no new results can be obtained in this way , since first one has to know the wave function of the system for all times .",
    "but the main point is that the interpretation in itself does not lead to any contradictions if one takes it literally .",
    "nevertheless one has to be very cautious in applying this interpretation . as is shown by the last example of the superposition of two harmonic oscillator eigenstates",
    ", one can not view the particle flow as just transferring the initial proabability distribution to a final one , which has to be normalized only , but agrees in shape with the result obtained in this way . on the contrary ,",
    "the factor @xmath76 may change this shape quite drastically in general and makes it very difficult to visualize what is going on ."
