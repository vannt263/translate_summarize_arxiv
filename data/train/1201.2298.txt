    "the single - band hubbard model with extended hopping on the square lattice has been widely investigated since the appearance of the high - temperature superconductors .",

    "a very rich variety of phases has been discussed in this context , including antiferromagnetism , superconductivity , charge - density waves , and non - fermi - liquid metals .",
    "@xcite studies with various numerical techniques , ranging from dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) ,  @xcite including its cluster extensions ,  @xcite to quantum monte carlo techniques ,  @xcite as well as analytic approaches ,  @xcite have addressed hotly debated topics like the nature of the pseudo - gap phase or the superconducting correlations .",
    "landau  @xcite and luttinger  @xcite have shown that the fermi surface , which is the locus of gapless electronic excitations in @xmath1-space , represents a pivoting concept in the theory of fermi liquids .",
    "the generalization of this notion for gapped systems ( e.g. , superconductors or mott insulators ) leads to the idea that there is an underlying fermi surface that becomes gapped because of some symmetry breaking ( leading to superconductivity ) or electronic correlation ( leading to a mott insulator ) .",
    "in particular , the underlying fermi surface can be defined by the locus of points where @xmath2 changes sign ( @xmath3 is the single - particle green s function ) , passing either to infinity ( for usual fermi liquids with well defined quasiparticles ) or to zero .",
    "@xcite the question of determining the underlying fermi surface is of central importance in strongly correlated systems , particularly in view of experiments with angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "@xcite from the theoretical point of view , there are few attempts to study the topology of the fermi surface in correlated systems ; furthermore , they are limited to mean - field approaches ,  @xcite including recent calculations with cluster dmft .",
    "@xcite here , we make a substantial step forward and consider non - perturbative calculations directly in a two - dimensional system .",
    "we use variational wave functions containing backflow correlations , which have been shown to be very accurate in the hubbard model ,  @xcite and focus our attention on the topology of the underlying fermi surface and the superconducting properties .",
    "we show that a strong renormalization of the underlying fermi surface takes place close to half filling , when the mott insulator is approached .",
    "in particular , the renormalization to perfect nesting occurring at the interaction - driven metal - insulator transition opens a new perspective on the crucial role of momentum dependence in describing the mott transition .    at finite dopings",
    "we find a sharp crossover line , which emerges from the mott - hubbard transition point at half filling and separates a weakly - correlated metal and a strong - coupling superconducting state , in agreement with a recent observation of an unconventional metallic state at finite dopings .",
