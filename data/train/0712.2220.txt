    "the rich - get - richer mechanism , or preferential attachment , is often invoked to explain the ubiquity of pareto distributions in complex networks and in natural and man - made phenomena  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the barabsi - albert model for complex networks  @xcite a power - law tail in the degree distribution of the nodes , @xmath3 , arises when new nodes are attached to the net , one at a time , to one of the existing nodes with a probability proportional to their degree .",
    "crucial to the emergence of this power - law tail , however , is also the fact that the net _ grows _ with time ( new nodes are attached )  preferential attachment alone is not the only necessary ingredient .    in this paper",
    "we study the consequences of preferential attachment without growth , that is , when  wealth \" is disbursed to a _ finite _ group of @xmath4 agents by the rich - get - richer mechanism .",
    "more precisely , wealth is incremented by the rich - get - richer mechanism only a fraction @xmath0 of the time ; the remainder of the time ( a fraction @xmath5 ) wealth is disbursed homogeneously at random . for an infinite number of agents , @xmath5 is simply the rate at which new agents are introduced ( are given their first unit of wealth ) , and there results a pareto distribution of wealth , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath4 is finite , however , the homogeneous process may allot wealth to agents that had already been introduced .",
    "the case when @xmath8 and wealth is disbursed only by the homogeneous process results in a gaussian distribution of wealth  quite different from the power - law distribution found in the limit of @xmath9 .",
    "the two extremes , of @xmath9 , and @xmath10 and @xmath8 , dominate the general case , pulling the system toward opposite poles and resulting in a kinetic phase transition : the long - time asymptotic distribution of wealth is gaussian for @xmath1 , but has a power - law tail for @xmath2 . in all cases the wealth distribution can be written in scaling form , and the shape of the scaling function is characterized by various @xmath0-dependent exponents that we obtain analytically .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in we",
    "present the model and analyze the two special limits that color its behavior .",
    "this section serves also to illustrate the two mathematical techniques that we employ for the model s analysis : the _ master equation _",
    "( for the number of agents with a given wealth ) and the _ rate equation _ approach ( called also _",
    "mean - field _ by other researchers ) . in the latter approach",
    "one uses a rate equation to compute the expected wealth of a particular agent as a function of the time of its introduction . the wealth distribution",
    "may then be obtained from the distribution of the introduction times .",
    "the general case is treated in .",
    "we derive several analytical results and compare to computer simulations , as well as discuss the range of validity of the rate equation approach .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our findings and a discussion in .",
    "we analyze the following toy model of wealth allotment . a single wealth unit is given per unit time to a random member out of @xmath4 agents . with probability @xmath0",
    "the agent is chosen by the _ rich - get - richer _ mechanism , proportional to its current wealth ; with probability @xmath5 the agent is chosen _ uniformly at random_. thus @xmath0 is a tunable parameter controlling the relative strengths of these two processes .",
    "we assume that initially each agent has zero wealth .",
    "let us start by exploring the two limits of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "these exactly solvable extremes yield markedly different behavior and underlie the essential physics of the system when @xmath4 and @xmath0 are finite : for @xmath1 the uniform random process dominates , while for @xmath2 the rich - get - richer process gets the upper hand .      for @xmath11 , agents with positive wealth form a set of measure zero for any finite time .",
    "thus choosing an agent uniformly at random is equivalent to the `` birth '' of a new agent  @xmath13 with wealth @xmath14 .",
    "we analyze this case with a master equation approach , following the techniques and notation of  @xcite .",
    "the number of agents with wealth @xmath15 at time @xmath16 , @xmath17 , obeys the master equation : @xmath18 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eqn : infrate}\\ ] ] since one wealth unit is disbursed per unit time , @xmath19 .",
    "this limit is characterized by both growth and preferential attachment , hence we expect a power - law distribution of wealth .",
    "this master equation has been studied before  @xcite and indeed it is easy to show that the actual distribution of wealth is @xmath20 one can also derive this distribution using a rate equation for the average wealth of agent @xmath13 : @xmath21 since @xmath22 . because @xmath9 , the rate at which agent @xmath13 is selected by the homogeneous random process is zero , while the rate of selection by the rich - get - richer mechanism is @xmath23 .",
    "following the analysis in  @xcite , one can show that @xmath24 i.e. , a pareto distribution with the same power - law tail .",
    "note that this distribution is properly normalized ( taking @xmath25 to be a continuous variable ) and that its first moment agrees with that from the master equation .",
    "while the results for both the master equation and the rate equation approach are equivalent for @xmath11 , we will show that this is no longer true for @xmath26 .",
    "when the number of agents @xmath4 is finite , the @xmath27 obey the normalization condition @xmath28 where now we include in the counting agents with zero wealth ( @xmath29 ) , and the distribution of wealth is @xmath30 .",
    "the mean wealth per agent increases linearly with time : @xmath31 consider the limit of @xmath12 , where wealth is disbursed only by the homogeneous random process .",
    "the corresponding master equation is @xmath32 with initial and boundary conditions @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this is a simple poisson process , as confirmed by the solution of : @xmath35 for @xmath36 we apply the sterling approximation to obtain the distribution @xmath37 thus , @xmath38 has a power - law tail in the limit @xmath9 ( ) , but is gaussian when @xmath4 is finite and @xmath12 .",
    "in the general case of @xmath10 and @xmath39 the master equation for the process is @xmath40 the system is then simultaneously pulled toward the two different limiting behaviors analyzed in .",
    "we will show that for @xmath2 the rich - get - richer mechanism dominates the process and the wealth distribution develops a power - law tail ( as for the limit of @xmath9 ) , while for @xmath1 the homogeneous random process dominates and the wealth distribution tends to a gaussian ( as for @xmath12 ) . because @xmath4 is finite , @xmath41 increases linearly with time .",
    "the width of the distribution of @xmath25 around the average grows like @xmath42 , where the scaling exponent @xmath43 for @xmath2 and @xmath44 for @xmath1 . at the transition point ,",
    "@xmath45 , the width scales as @xmath46 .    to see this , begin by approximating the discrete distribution @xmath17 by its continuous counterpart , @xmath38 .",
    "expanding to first - order , equation now reads @xmath47 and the method of characteristics yields the scaling solution @xmath48 this , however , can not be true for all values of @xmath0 , as it disagrees with the distribution found for @xmath8 , where the scaling exponent is @xmath44 instead of @xmath49 .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is that in this case the kramers - moyal expansion  @xcite of must be carried out beyond the first order . indeed ,",
    "on substituting the scaling form in the master equation ( with unspecified @xmath50 ) , and carrying out the expansion to second - order , we find @xmath51 where prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath52 , and we have omitted terms proportional to @xmath42 ( these are negligible compared to @xmath53 , as @xmath54 ) . if @xmath55 , the term proportional to @xmath16 can be neglected in the long - time limit , and is satisfied provided that @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the scaling form is valid only for @xmath2 . for @xmath1 , however , the second - order term in may not be ignored . the only non - trivial way to cancel out the time dependence is then to have @xmath56 .",
    "thus , for @xmath1 the scaling exponent is @xmath44 . at the transition point ,",
    "@xmath45 , there is no way to get rid of the time dependence in with the scaling form . taking a cue from other phase transitions",
    "we guess a scaling form with logarithmic dependence : @xmath57 on expanding the master equation with this scaling form the leading behavior in time cancels out , provided that the scaling exponent is @xmath44 .",
    "the next largest terms ( smaller by a @xmath58 factor ) , yield the equation @xmath59 where now @xmath60 . in all three cases ( for @xmath0 ) , expanding to third- or higher - order yields additional subdominant terms .",
    "from the largest subdominant term one can deduce how fast the system reaches the scaling regime : the transient dies off as @xmath61 for @xmath2 , as @xmath62 for @xmath1 , and as @xmath63 for @xmath45 .",
    "thus at the transition point , @xmath45 , there occurs a _",
    "critical slowing down _ as the system creeps into the eventual scaling regime logarithmically slow .    for @xmath1 we can use to find out @xmath64 and",
    "show that the limiting form of the wealth distribution is gaussian : @xmath65\\,;\\qquad r<\\frac{1}{2}\\,,\\ ] ] as @xmath54 .",
    "the divergence of the width of this distribution as @xmath66 is reconciled with the fact that at the limit @xmath45 the scaling parameter picks up a ( diverging ) logarithmic component .",
    "the scaling function is still gaussian , as can be deduced from  : @xmath67\\,;\\qquad r=\\frac{1}{2}\\,.\\ ] ] for @xmath2 equation yields a tautology and one is unable to determine @xmath64 .",
    "it is possible , nevertheless , to infer the limiting behavior : @xmath68 & $ x\\to -\\infty$ , } \\quad r>\\frac{1}{2}\\,.\\ ] ] the limit for @xmath69 follows from comparing the distribution @xmath38 for the case of @xmath9 with @xmath70 . for @xmath71",
    ", we observe that the density of agents with zero wealth decays as @xmath72 $ ] , see equation , and we compare to @xmath73 , leading to the second line of .",
    "an alternative derivation is presented next , using the rate equation approach .",
    "the rate equation for the wealth of agent @xmath13 , in the general case , is @xmath74 with initial condition @xmath75 .",
    "the solution , @xmath76 is monotonously decreasing in @xmath77 .",
    "the probability @xmath78 that an agent has still zero wealth at time @xmath16 satisfies the equation @xmath79 so @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "it follows that the probability that agent @xmath13 has been introduced ( gets its first unit of wealth ) by time @xmath81 , given that it has been introduced by time @xmath16 , is @xmath82 note that this has the limit @xmath83 , as @xmath9 , that is normally used for this case  @xcite .    finally , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the solution to @xmath86 . since   can not be inverted analytically ( other than for special values of @xmath0 )",
    ", we express @xmath87 in parametric form : @xmath88 , and @xmath89 is obtained by putting @xmath90 in . the wealth distribution in parametric form",
    "is then @xmath91 where we have used the scaled expressions @xmath92 and @xmath93 , taking the limit of @xmath54 at the end ( the fact that the limit exists and is finite confirms this scaling ) .",
    "it is now easy to verify the asymptotic behavior  .",
    "the limit @xmath69 corresponds to @xmath94 . in this limit ,",
    "the second equation of   gives @xmath95 .",
    "but since @xmath96 , from the first equation , we conclude that @xmath97 .",
    "the limit @xmath71 corresponds to @xmath98 . in this limit ,",
    "the second equation of   gives @xmath99 $ ] , while from the first equation @xmath100 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "+    clearly , the foregoing rate equation method does not apply to @xmath102 , for it fails to reproduce the appropriate scaling forms in this range .",
    "thus the rate equation approach is viable only when the second - order in the kramers - moyal expansion of the corresponding master equation may be neglected . in",
    "we show numerical simulations for @xmath0 below , above , and at the transition point .",
    "the results confirm the scaling forms found analytically above . for @xmath1 convergence to the gaussian pdf is relatively fast , while the critical slowing down at the transition point , @xmath45 , prevents us from attaining the analytical limit   in practice . for @xmath2 convergence to the scaling pdf is again quick , however the explicit form predicted by the rate equation approach is correct only qualitatively : we ascribe this to the fact that the second - order is implicitly missing in this approach .",
    "in summary , we have studied a model of a finite number @xmath4 of agents that accrue  wealth \" by the rich - get - richer mechanism a fraction @xmath0 of the time ( wealth is disbursed homogeneously randomly the remainder @xmath5 of the time ) . in the early time regime , or , equivalently , when @xmath9 there results a pareto distribution of the wealth @xmath25 : @xmath6 , with @xmath103 . in the long time asymptotic limit , the system is attracted to one of two opposite poles , and there is a kinetic phase transition as a function of the parameter @xmath0 . if @xmath1 , the distribution tends to a gaussian of width @xmath104 $ ] . if @xmath2 , the distribution keeps its power - law tail @xmath105 for large  @xmath25 .    in all cases",
    "the wealth distribution tends to an asymptotic scaling form as a function of @xmath106 , where @xmath41 is the average wealth amassed by an agent by the time @xmath16 , and @xmath107 is a measure of the width of the distribution .",
    "the exponent @xmath50 undergoes a phase transition : @xmath44 for @xmath1 , and @xmath43 for @xmath2 . at the transition point ,",
    "@xmath45 , there appear logarithmic corrections : @xmath108 .",
    "the scaling form of the wealth distribution @xmath109 in the regime @xmath2 is characterized by two more exponents ( in addition to the width exponent @xmath43 ) : @xmath110 for @xmath69 , and @xmath64 decays as a stretched - exponential , with power @xmath111 , as @xmath71 .",
    "finally , the approach to the eventual scaling form @xmath112 is characterized by a fourth exponent : @xmath113 for @xmath1 , and @xmath114 for @xmath2 . at the transition point convergence to the scaling form proceeds exceedingly slow , @xmath115 , in a fashion reminiscent of critical slowing down in equilibrium phase transitions .",
    "several applications come to mind .",
    "for example , complex networks could be grown according to this model where the nodes are fixed at the outset ( corresponding to the @xmath4 agents ) and links are connected to the nodes by a proper mix of homogeneous selection and preferential attachment . for @xmath2 one could thus create scale - free nets with a fixed degree distribution exponent and a fixed number of nodes , and with a tunable average connectivity @xmath41 that grows linearly with time .",
    "wealth distributions with a stretched - exponential decay on one side and a power - law decay on the other , such as we find for @xmath2 , are regularly observed in various economic settings  @xcite .",
    "an intriguing finding concerns the method of rate equations , or mean - field method that is often used to obtain the degree distribution of complex networks  @xcite .",
    "our analysis suggests that this method is only valid when the second - order terms in the kramers - moyal expansion of the master equation for the system may be safely neglected .",
    "even then the method yields results that scale correctly but that are otherwise only qualitatively correct , at least in our case .",
    "perhaps the most important open problem is to establish the range of validity of the rate equation approach more rigorously , and to find ways to extend it to the cases where it fails .",
