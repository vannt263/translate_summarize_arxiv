    "with the increased interest in producing and exploiting nanostructured materials , it is necessary to expand the methods that go beyond crystallography @xcite for characterizing their atomic scale structure . in recent years ,",
    "total scattering and atomic pair distribution function ( pdf ) analysis @xcite has emerged as a popular and powerful tool for this purpose @xcite . to satisfy this demand a number of x - ray and neutron beamlines dedicated to or optimized for",
    ", such measurements have emerged @xcite , and manufacturers of laboratory x - ray sources are also beginning to market instruments for this kind of measurement . especially with",
    "the use of 2d detectors , modern beamlines are yielding total scattering data at unprecedented rates allowing detailed parametric and time - resolved total scattering studies to be carried out in special environments @xcite .",
    "a bottleneck in further growth of the method is now the lack of robust and automatable software for creating pdfs from the raw data , currently a computationally and user - intensive process @xcite .",
    "this can be illustrated by considering one of the most widely used software programs for this purpose , pdfgetx2 @xcite .",
    "the program offers users a great deal of flexibility and control in choosing exactly which corrections to apply to x - ray scattering intensities in order to convert them to pdfs .",
    "however , due to the myriad of options available to users as well as the esoteric nature of many of the corrections @xcite , pdf generation requires considerable user input and expertise in arcane details of the technique .",
    "although the software has a graphical user interface , it is a time intensive process to carry out the corrections , with many possibilities for input errors , and the process ca nt be easily automated for high throughput of many data sets .    in this paper , we describe a new software program , pdfgetx3 , which implements an _ ad - hoc _ data reduction algorithm @xcite that requires little user input , generates pdfs in a fraction of a second , and can be straightforwardly automated to batch - process thousands of pdfs .",
    "here we show that in the physically relevant region of the pdf it produces quantitatively accurate pdfs that are the same as those obtained using pdfgetx2 for the cases shown , and which yield refined structural parameters that are also indistinguishable from those refined from pdfgetx2 determined pdfs .",
    "the intensities measured in a total scattering experiment , @xmath0 , can be expressed as @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the coherent scattering intensity , which contains all of the structural information about the sample , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are multiplicative and additive corrections to the measured intensity , which do not contain structural information @xcite .",
    "examples of the additive contributions are incoherent compton scattering and background scattering from the sample container",
    ". examples of the multiplicative contributions are sample self - absorption and polarization of the x - ray beam .",
    "the approach used by pdfgetx2 , and other pdf data analysis programs , is to apply known corrections to the @xmath0 to obtain the coherent scattering , @xmath2 , which is transformed into the structure function , @xmath5 according to @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the atomic scattering factor and the angle brackets indicate an average over all the atom types in the sample . for the neutron case",
    "the @xmath8 s are replaced by coherent neutron scattering lengths , @xmath9 , in this equation .",
    "the @xmath5 is fourier transformed into the pdf , @xmath10 , according to @xcite @xmath11\\sin qr\\>dq\\\\           & = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_{q_{min}}^{q_{max } } f(q ) \\sin qr\\>dq , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the quantity @xmath12 $ ] is the reduced structure function @xcite .",
    "the many corrections required are discussed in detail in chapter 5 of egami and billinge @xcite , including background subtraction , polarization , self - absorption , multiple scattering and compton scattering , among many others , and these are implemented in pdfgetx2 @xcite and other similar programs @xcite .",
    "it has recently been pointed out @xcite that sufficient information is known about the general behavior of the correction terms in eq .",
    "[ eq;iexp ] , and about the asymptotic behavior of the resulting @xmath13 function , that it may be possible to determine @xmath3 and @xmath4 through an _ ad - hoc _ approach where they are parameterized and the parameters varied using a regression method in such a way as to yield an accurate @xmath13 function .",
    "here we describe an algorithm for doing this , as well as a software implementation , pdfgetx3 , and we show that , indeed , it yields pdfs that are not significantly different from those obtained using pdfgetx2 .",
    "the program is fast , easy to use , and highly automatable .",
    "the method was developed initially for analyzing rapid acquisition pdf data from 2d detectors , though we show below that it is not limited to this application .",
    "it is assumed that the 2d data have been correctly azimuthally integrated , and multiple frames summed or averaged , to obtain a one - dimensional intensity vs.  @xmath14 or intensity vs.  @xmath15 diffraction .",
    "a number of integration programs exist for this purpose , for example fit2d @xcite .",
    "the algorithm @xcite starts with raw intensity data measured versus scattering angle @xmath15 . at first",
    ", the angle is converted to scattering vector @xmath14 and the data are re - sampled to an equidistant @xmath14-grid , which is suitable for a fast fourier transformation at a later step and also ensures constant weights in a @xmath14-dependent fitting .",
    "note that resampling introduces error correlations between points which can be minimized if the data are azimuthally integrated from 2d directly onto a constant-@xmath14 grid @xcite .",
    "the background intensities from an empty container are then re - sampled to the same q - grid and subtracted from the sample data .",
    "this yields raw intensities from the specimen only ; however , which are not normalized per incident intensity nor per the number of scatterers .",
    "the structure function @xmath5 should oscillate around and then approach unity as @xmath14 tends to infinity , which in practice is about @xmath16  @xmath17 .",
    "this means that the difference @xmath18 must oscillate around zero and the normalized intensity @xmath19 must be close to the normal scattering factor @xmath20 for any @xmath14 .",
    "the raw sample intensities are therefore rescaled by a least - squares procedure to approach the normal scattering factor curve .",
    "a physically correct scattering function @xmath5 should also display proper asymptotic behavior as a derived function @xmath21 , which should oscillate around zero and approach it with increasing @xmath14 .",
    "the pdfgetx3 algorithm is based on an assumption that the experimental function @xmath22 deviates from the correct value by a slowly changing additive factor @xmath23 such that @xmath24 the derived function @xmath25 is then @xmath26 =      f(q ) + q \\beta_{s}(q).\\ ] ] because the correct function @xmath13 oscillates around zero , the error term @xmath23 produces a slowly changing , @xmath14-increasing background in @xmath25 .",
    "the pdfgetx3 algorithm estimates the background by modeling the @xmath23 function as an @xmath27-th degree polynomial @xmath28 , which is then fitted as @xmath29 to the @xmath25 function .",
    "the corrected function @xmath30 is afterwards obtained by subtracting the polynomial fit @xmath31 the function @xmath30 shows the correct asymptotic behavior with @xmath32 for large @xmath14 values .",
    "finally , the @xmath30 signal is converted to @xmath10 using the fast fourier transformation as per eq .",
    "[ eq , gr ] .",
    "since the fitted polynomial is an approximation to the actual error term @xmath23 , the corrected function @xmath30 still deviates from the ideal @xmath33 by @xmath34 and the difference introduces an error signal @xmath35 in the obtained pdf .",
    "the function @xmath29 is an @xmath36st - degree polynomial approximation to the @xmath37 function on a fit interval running from zero to @xmath38 , therefore we can assume that the @xmath39 difference has @xmath36 roots that are essentially equidistant between @xmath40  @xmath17  and @xmath38 .",
    "the difference function @xmath39 switches between positive and negative values at each root , which roughly corresponds to oscillations with a half - period of @xmath41 . assuming this to be the maximum @xmath14 `` frequency '' in the difference signal @xmath39",
    ", the fourier transformation would introduce non - physical signal @xmath35 extending up to @xmath42 for a typical rapdf experimental data , the pdfgetx3 program uses an 8-th degree polynomial correction with @xmath38  = 28  @xmath17 , which yields @xmath43  = 0.9   .",
    "assuming there are no higher frequency aberrations in the data themselves , the error signal @xmath35 arising from the polynomial data correction is thus present only for lengths smaller than @xmath44   , i.e. , in a region below the shortest bond - lengths in most materials .",
    "furthermore , the polynomial fit can not accidentally remove real structural signals from the experimental intensity provided the value of @xmath43  is chosen to be below the nearest neighbor bond distance in the material .    under some experimental conditions such as from lower energy x - ray sources , or where the experimental take - off angle is very limited ,",
    "the instrument @xmath14-range @xmath38  is much smaller and may increase the error extent @xmath43  to physically meaningful distances . in such cases , the degree of the correction polynomial @xmath27 needs to be reduced to avoid overcorrecting the measured data and to keep the value of @xmath43  small .",
    "the pdfgetx3 procedure uses eq .",
    "[ eq , rpoly ] in reverse , and for a fixed value of the error extent @xmath43  and instrument range @xmath38 , it obtains the degree of correction polynomial as @xmath45 this estimate of the polynomial degree @xmath46 is almost never an integer , and rounding it to an integer would introduce abrupt changes in the pdf at the half - integer values .",
    "we would prefer the pdf to respond smoothly to the @xmath43  and @xmath38  parameters . to simulate a polynomial fit at an arbitrary floating - point degree ,",
    "the correction polynomial is therefore refined twice , for an integer floor and ceiling of @xmath46 , and the two fits are then averaged with the weights given by the distance of @xmath46 from its integer bounds .",
    "pdfgetx3 is written in the python programming language @xcite .",
    "to run , it requires python 2.5 or later with the numpy and matplotlib libraries installed ( note that python 3.0 is not currently supported ) .",
    "it has been tested to work on the windows , linux , and mac operating systems .",
    "information on the installation and operation of the software can be found at the www.diffpy.org website .",
    "the command - line version is free for university based researchers conducting open academic research , but other uses require a paid license . a version with a graphical user interface ( gui ) and online version also under development .",
    "information can be found at http://diffpy.org .    because the corrections are _ ad - hoc _ , only minimal information needs to be supplied by the user and this is contained in a configuration file , or can be specified as a command - line argument . in the current implementation",
    "the program reads data that are stored in a multi - column text file with the independent variable , @xmath14 or @xmath15 in the first column and the measured intensity in the second .",
    "if the uncertainties on points in the data are known , these may be placed in subsequent columns .",
    "the filename for the input file , and a measured background file if one wants to subtract it , must be specified and if the independent variable is @xmath15 then an x - ray wavelength must also be specified .",
    "the approximate composition of the sample is also specified so that the @xmath7 averages may be computed accurately .",
    "a background scale parameter , and @xmath47 to be used in the fourier transform , are specified , though these have default values and the program works when they are not provided .",
    "the optimal values of some of these parameters may not be known _ a priori _ and the program may be run in an interactive mode where various tuning parameters may be varied by sliding a slider with the resulting pdfs updating in real - time in a plot window . in this way",
    "a user may quickly find the optimal @xmath47 and background scale values that are fed back to the program .",
    "it takes only a few microseconds to complete the corrections on the raw data and so the plots update in real - time as the user adjusts the slider .",
    "some other parameters may also be controlled by the user to obtain the desired output , as described in the manual .",
    "the program has a powerful python - based command - line interpreter capability , for example , allowing templates to be used for multiple files that have the same filename - root but which iterate in some way in the name , for example , by run number .",
    "this makes the automation of data reduction of many hundreds or thousands of datasets rather straightforward .",
    "the program is also written with a well documented api so that programmers can access the functionality of the engine within home written python scripts of arbitrary complexity .",
    "a screenshot of the program working in interactive mode is shown in figure  [ fig;screenshot ] .     and @xmath10 .",

    "the first two are self explanatory .",
    "@xmath38  varies the range over which the correction polynomial is fit and @xmath43  places an upper bound on the frequency of information that the _ ad - hoc _ procedure can remove by fitting ( see @xcite for details ) .",
