    "the existence of heavy elements in the intracluster medium ( icm ) has been known since the discovery of the @xmath2 kev  line in the perseus cluster ( mitchell et al . 1976 ) and indicates that part of the icm is not primordial , i.e. was processed in stars and injected into the icm .",
    "if the emitting plasma is assumed to be optically thin then the iron line flux can be converted into an elemental abundance . when this is done the inferred icm iron abundances are typically in the range 0.30.4 solar ( mushotzky & loewenstein 1997 ) .",
    "the measurements of abundances of iron and other elements are key data used in constraining models of the formation and evolution of the icm .",
    "therefore , it is important to check that line fluxes can be unambiguously converted to elemental abundances .",
    "a key assumption is that the plasma is optically thin .",
    "however , gilfanov , sunyaev & churazov ( 1987 ) pointed out that this may not always be true for the  line .",
    "resonant scattering ( the absorption and immediate re - emission of an  line photon by an fe ion ) could be significant in the cores of clusters . if so , the line emission from the cluster core would be reduced because of photons being scattered out of the line of sight and the measured fe abundance would be an underestimate of the true intracluster gas abundance . the simplest test for resonant scattering in the line",
    "is to compare the line flux with that from the  line .",
    "the optical depth in the  line is @xmath3 of the so that if the  ratio is anomalously high then resonant scattering must be taken into account .",
    "such anomalous ratios have been observed with low significance in data from the heao 1 ( mitchell & mushotzky 1980 ) and _ tenma  _ ( okumura 1988 ) satellites .",
    "recently , these results have been placed on a much firmer basis using observations of several clusters using _ asca _ ( akimoto 1997 ; yamashita 1999 ) and of the perseus cluster using  ( molendi 1998 ) .",
    "the best data are from molendi  who show that the  ratio is anomalously high for the inner 6 @xmath1 of the perseus cluster . outside that radius",
    "the ratio decreases to the expected value for an optically thin plasma .",
    "they deduce from this that the fe abundance is underestimated by about a factor of 2 in the center of the perseus cluster .",
    "however , at the resolution of current x - ray spectrometers the line is confused with the  line so that a measurement of the ratio requires an assumed flux in the  line .",
    "the results reported above assumed that the ratio of ni and fe abundances is similar to the solar value ( 0.038 by number - photospheric value ; anders & grevesse 1989 ) . to make the  ratio consistent with the optically thin case requires a ni / fe abundance ratio several times that of solar . to see whether this is reasonable it is necessary to consider how heavy elements arrived in the icm .",
    "@xmath4 fpcs spectroscopy ( canizares et al .  1982 ) and more recent _ asca _ spectroscopy ( mushotzky & loewenstein 1997 ; mushotzky et al .  1996 ) suggest that global intracluster metal abundances are consistent with ejecta from type ii supernovae ( sn ii ) .",
    "this implies that the bulk of the heavy elements were injected into the icm by protogalactic winds .",
    "this is further supported by analysis of icm energetics ( white 1991 ) . since sn",
    "ii do not produce much ni we do not expect ni / fe abundance ratios large enough to restore the ratio to the optically thin value",
    ". however , there are recent indications that sn ia ejecta can contribute with a significant fraction ( up to 50% ) of the icm metals ( ishimaru & arimoto 1997 ; fukazawa et al .  1998 ; nagataki & sato 1998 , finoguenov & ponman 1999 , allen et al . 2000 ) .",
    "clues to metal enrichment mechanisms in clusters can be derived from the analysis of clusters with central abundance enhancements ( abundance gradients ) .",
    "analysis of spatially resolved x - ray spectra has shown that in several clusters the metal abundance is centrally enhanced ( koyama , takano & tawara 1991 ; white et al .  1994 ;",
    "fukazawa et al .  1994 ; ulmer et al .",

    "there are several mechanisms which may cause central abundance enhancements in the icm including : 1 ) the radial profile of intracluster gas density is shallower than that of metal - injecting galaxies , i.e. , if metals trace the galaxies that injected them into the icm and these galaxies are more concentrated in the center than the intracluster gas one would expect to find a general abundance enhancement towards the clusters central regions ; 2 ) mass loss from the stars in central dominant galaxies may accumulate near the cluster center ; 3 ) ram - pressure stripping of the metal - rich gas in cluster galaxies by intracluster gas is more effective at the center , where the intracluster gas density is highest ; 4 ) secular sn ia winds in central dominant galaxies which are partially suppressed due to the galaxy location at the bottom of the cluster gravitational potential , where the intracluster gas density is highest ( dupke & white 2000b )",
    ". some of the above mentioned mechanisms could deposit substantial amounts of sn ia enriched material near the clusters center , therefore creating a `` chemical gradient '' . since sne ia and",
    "ii have different elemental mass yields , analysis of the elemental abundance ratios provides information on the fractional contribution of gas enriched by sn ia and ii .",
    "the analysis of abundance ratios in the central regions of clusters having abundance gradients indeed indicates a dominance of sn ia ejecta ( dupke & white 2000a , b see below ) .    as mentioned above",
    ", sn ia metal injection mechanisms such as ram - pressure stripping or post - protogalactic suppressed sn ia winds may contribute significantly to icm enrichment .",
    "sn ia can generate large amounts of ni .",
    "`` convective deflagration '' models such as w7 ( nomoto , thieleman , & yokoi 1984 ; thieleman , nomoto & yokoi 1986 ) predict a ni / fe number abundance ratio @xmath5 times solar .",
    "alternative slow flame - speed ( delayed detonation ) models produce a lower ni / fe abundance ratio closer to that from sn ii ( @xmath6 1.6 ) .",
    "recently , dupke & white ( 2000a ) and dupke ( 1998 ) have found evidence that in the central regions of a496 , a2199 , and a3571 the icm is enriched predominantly by sn ia ejecta . in these objects",
    "the ratio of fe abundance to that of @xmath7-process elements increases with decreasing radius from the cluster center .",
    "these results suggest that , in clusters for which the abundance profile is centrally enhanced , sn ia ejecta provide most of the total iron mass in the central regions ( see also allen et al .",
    "1999 ) . in the outer regions the sn ia contribution is smaller than in the cluster s center but not negligible ( e.g. nagataki & sato 1998 ) . in a496 the excess iron that generates the central abundance gradient",
    "is fully accounted for by the excess sn ia ejecta that produce a chemical gradient ( dupke & white 2000b ) . in all three clusters mentioned above",
    "the ni / fe abundance ratio is consistent with that predicted by the sn ia `` convective deflagration '' w7 model , i.e. , the ni / fe ratio is several times solar ( assuming that the  ratio takes its optically thin value ) .",
    "the analysis of a1060 ( the only cluster with flat abundance distribution in dupke s sample ( 1998 ) ) shows no significant abundance ratio trend in its radial distribution ( including the ni / fe ratio ) .",
    "however , since the number of clusters with detailed measured abundance ratio distributions is relatively small , it is not clear whether this `` chemical gradient '' is always true for clusters with central abundance gradients .",
    "this work extends the analysis of dupke & white ( 2000a ) to the perseus cluster .",
    "this cluster is closer and brighter than a496 , a2199 , and a3571 so we can determine elemental abundance ratios with higher precision .",
    "the fe abundance is known to be centrally enhanced in perseus ( ulmer 1987 ; ponman 1990 ; kowalski et al .",
    "1993 ; arnaud 1994 ; molendi 1998 ) .",
    "if gradients in abundance and abundance ratios are related there should be a significant contribution from sn ia ejecta in the regions where the abundance is enhanced .",
    "we argue below that the central regions of the perseus cluster do show evidence for sn ia ejecta dominance , that the ni / fe abundance ratio is that predicted by the w7 models , and hence there is no evidence for resonant scattering in the  line and the measured fe abundance is reliable .",
    "this result also argues against delayed detonation models for sn ia and illustrates the power of x - ray observations of clusters of galaxies to learn about supernova physics .",
    "we note that there are no measurements of ni abundances from observations of galactic supernova remnants because these objects are too cool to provide significant counts in the ni k lines .",
    "the perseus cluster is one of the closest , x - ray bright , rich cluster of galaxies .",
    "its x - ray emission , has been the object of many studies since its discovery as an x - ray source by fritz et al .",
    "it is a nearby cluster ( at a redshift of 0.0183 ) and bautz - morgan type ii - iii .",
    "the cluster is elongated and the ratio of its minor to major axis is 0.83 at radii greater than 20 ( snyder et al .",
    "the radiative cooling time of the x - ray emitting gas in the central regions of perseus is less than a hubble time so the cluster has a cooling flow with a mass deposition rate of about ( 15)@xmath8 m@xmath9 yr@xmath10 ( fabian et al .",

    "_ asca _ carries four large - area x - ray telescopes , each with its own detector : two gas imaging spectrometers ( gis ) and two solid - state imaging spectrometers ( sis ) .",

    "rise time rejection of particle events was performed on gis data , and hot and flickering pixels were removed from sis data .",

    "the gas temperature in the very central region ( @xmath16 ) is relatively low ( @xmath6 4.5 kev ) .",
    "therefore , the effect of high energy photon depletion in that region due to the psf is negligible ( takahashi et al .",
    "furthermore , the best - fit temperature for that region agrees very well with that of white ( 2000 ) , who did correct for the psf , when the same fitting spectral models are used ( see below ) .",
    "therefore , we do not worry about _ asca _ psf scattering .",
    "we also include the analysis of a @xmath17 region centered in the x - ray peak , which is more than three times larger than that where molendi et al .",
    "detected resonant scattering .",
    "we analyzed this larger region for the purpose of 1 ) measuring the elemental abundances in a region large enough so that resonant scattering is not effective , 2 ) helping to discriminate between different delayed detonation sn ia explosion models with better photon statistics and 3 ) giving a better idea of the uncertainties involved when a power law spectral component is introduced .",
    "we used xspec v10.0 ( arnaud 1996 ) to analyze the sis and gis spectra separately and jointly .",
    "the spectra were fit using the mekal and vmekal thermal emission models , which are based on the emissivity calculations of mewe & kaastra ( cf .",

    "the second is a region of 10@xmath1 radius centered 35@xmath1 from the center ( outer pointing ) , selected to provide a measurement of abundances well outside the core .",
    "the third is a circular region of 20@xmath1 radius around the cluster s x - ray center ( basically covering the whole effective field of view of the central pointing ) .    since there is a moderate cooling flow in the center of the perseus cluster we added a cooling flow component to the mekal isothermal emission model in the central region .",
    "we adopted the emission measure temperature distribution that corresponds to an isobaric cooling flow .",
    "we tied the maximum temperature of the cooling flow to the temperature of the isothermal component , and we fixed the minimum temperature at 0.1 kev .",
    "the abundances of the two emission components ( mekal and cflow ) were tied together .",
    "we also applied a single ( but variable ) galactic absorption to both spectral components wabs and a variable extra absorption zwabs to the cooling flow component .",
    "we fitted spectra from the two siss and two giss independently and then from all four instruments together .",
    "the spectral fits of sis0 data for the central pointing had unusually high reduced chi - squared ( @xmath19 ) and showed spurious spectral features . in particular , the width of the fe k complex is 50% larger in sis0 than sis1 .",
    "we have no explanation for this discrepancy .",
    "nevertheless , the sis0 best - fits for the interesting parameters agreed well with those obtained with sis1 and the two giss . since the inclusion of the sis0 data did not alter the results significantly and made the @xmath20 significantly worse we excluded the instrument from our analysis .",
    "when performing joint fits , the redshifts parameters correspondent to spectral models applied to giss and sis1 were let free to vary to compensate for possible gain differences between different instruments .",
    "the individual and joint sis1 and gis fits achieved @xmath21 close to 1 and produced consistent estimates of temperatures and metal abundances .",
    "the best - fit values for the temperatures and abundances for the central 4@xmath1 and for the external pointing are shown in table 2 .",
    "it can be seen from table 2 that there is a positive temperature gradient .",
    "the best - fit temperature found for the outer region is @xmath22 kev and it declines to @xmath23 kev in the inner 4@xmath1 , which is consistent with the presence of a central cooling flow .",
    "there is a significant ( @xmath24 confidence ) central abundance enhancement .",
    "the abundance in the center is @xmath25 solar declining to @xmath26 solar at @xmath11 35@xmath1 from the center .",
    "we determined the abundances of individual elements using a fitting procedure similar to that used for determining general abundances , but with the vmekal spectral model in xspec .",
    "since the global abundance is mainly driven by fe , the cooling flow abundance was tied to the fe abundance of the vmekal component .",
    "we adopt as a basis for comparison the following theoretical elemental abundance ( by number ) ratios relative to solar values : for sn ia ( nomoto , thielemann & yokoi 1984 , nomoto et al .",
    "1997a ) , @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 and for sn ii ( nomoto et al .",
    "1997b ) , @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33    in our spectral model fits , the he abundance was fixed at the solar value , while c and n were fixed at 0.3 solar ( the derived abundances of other elements are not affected by the particular choice of c and n abundances ) . in order to test the statistical significance of the spectral fittings where individual elemental abundances are free to vary we used the f - test .",
    "initially , all the individual abundances were tied .",
    "then we systematically untied the abundance of each interesting element , refitted and a new @xmath20 was found .",
    "the difference between the @xmath34 of these two fits must follow a @xmath34 distribution with one degree of freedom ( bevington 1969 ) . based on the @xmath34 differences for each spectral fittings",

    "the significance is @xmath36 90% for mg , ar and ca , and therefore they are tied together .",
    "we used in our analysis only those abundances which were reasonably well constrained , namely o , ne , si , s , fe , & ni . the observed individual abundances are shown in table 3 for the central @xmath16 and for an outer circular region centered at @xmath37 away from the center with a radius of 10@xmath1 .",
    "the individual elemental abundances in the outer parts were not constrained enough to determine spatial variations of abundance ratios within the cluster .",
    "we , therefore , could only set upper limits for most individual elemental abundances other than fe in the outer region .",
    "we also determined the central fe abundance from the fe  l lines alone .",
    "the abundance found when the fe  k lines are ignored is 0.62 @xmath38 and is also shown in table 3 .",
    "this value is consistent with the abundance determined from the fe  k complex .",
    "the ni abundance determined from the l shell lines is not well constrained ( 1.3@xmath39 ) but it is consistent with that determined from the k shell complex .",
    "the best constrained individual abundances are fe , si , and ni . we also consider abundances of other elements when determining the sn ia fe mass fraction in the next section .",
    "discriminating between the products of sne ia and ii requires the determination of the abundances and abundance ratios of @xmath7-elements and comparison to sn models .",
    "the determination of the relative contributions of the two sn types is complicated by the theoretical uncertainties in the elemental mass yields for different sn models , especially for sne ii ( e.g. gibson , loewenstein & mushotzky 1997 ) . in general",
    ", sn ia models show far better agreement on elemental mass yields than sn ii models .",
    "however , discrepancies between some sn ia explosion models still exist .",
    "for example , the ni mass yields for models with fast flame - speed like w7 ( nomoto , thieleman , & yokoi 1984 ; thieleman , nomoto & yokoi 1986 ) , are @xmath40 times bigger than those for slow flame - speed ( delayed detonation ) . in view of these theoretical uncertainties ,",
    "it is better to use a combination of several different elemental abundance ratios when estimating the sn ia iron mass fraction , rather than basing analysis on a single specific ratio .    to determine the sn ia fe mass fraction contribution we considered several abundance ratios involving the elements described in the previous paragraph .",
    "the abundance ratios used are shown in table 4 , along with the expected theoretical abundance ratios ( by number , normalized by the solar photospheric values ) for pure sn ia ( for both w7 and delayed detonation explosion model wdd2 of nomoto et al .",
    "1997a ) and sn ii ejecta .",
    "all the errors associated with the observed abundance ratios are the propagated 90% confidence errors .",
    "the derived sn ia fe mass fractions for the inner region ( @xmath16 ) are also listed in table 4 .",
    "it can be seen that most abundance ratios show , within the 90@xmath41 confidence errors , a combination of sn ia and sn ii ejecta .",
    "some abundance ratios , however , are observed to be completely out of the predicted theoretical range for sn ia and ii , e.g. ne / s & ne / si . these measurements are consistent with the results of mushotzky  ( 1996 ) who also found that s is observed to be underabundant and ne overabundant relative to several different theoretical sn ii models . based on a detailed analysis of a496 , dupke & white ( 2000b ) proposed correcting the theoretical sn ii sulfur yields by 0.250.5 . to be conservative , we avoid including abundance ratios involving these two elements in the calculation of the sn ia iron mass fraction .    from the abundance ratios involving o , si , and fe , we derived the fraction of the iron mass from sn ia .",
    "the fe mass fraction estimates are also listed in table 4 .",
    "the average sn ia fe mass fraction based on ratios involving the above mentioned three elements is 0.69@xmath42 .",
    "this value is consistent with the sn ia fe mass fraction derived from the ni / fe abundance ratio alone ( 0.60@xmath43 ) .",
    "the total weighted average of the sn ia fe mass fractions based on ratios involving only the abundances of ni , o , si , & fe is 0.67@xmath44 .",
    "the observed ni / fe ratio is inconsistent with either : 1 ) pure sn ii ejecta or 2 ) a combination of sn ii and sn ia ejecta _ as predicted by delayed detonation models_. the mutual consistency of the derived sn ia fe mass fractions derived from different abundance ratios suggests that the ni / fe ratio is a robust indicator of sn ia ejecta contamination .",
    "it should be noticed that the si / fe ratio measured in the center ( 0 - 4@xmath1 ) of perseus ( 1.37@xmath45 ) is completely out of the range allowed by the delayed detonation model wdd1 ( si / fe @xmath35 1.69 ) .",
    "furthermore , if wdd2 is assumed there is a contradiction between the predicted sn ia fe mass fractions derived from si / fe ( 0.86@xmath46 ) and o / si ( @xmath360.73 ) .",
    "however , the only abundance ratio that is systematically in contradiction with all three delayed detonation models is ni / fe .",
    "figure 1 shows that the ni / fe abundance ratio derived in this work is consistent with the values found for other clusters that show central sn ia contamination .",
    "figure 1 also shows the theoretical predictions of the ni / fe ratio for sn ii and for three different sn ia delayed detonation models .",
    "it is clear from the figure that delayed detonation explosion models are not preferred over the standard models such as w7 .    in order to have the sn ia iron mass fractions derived from abundance ratios involving ne & s to agree with those involving other elements ( @xmath47 )",
    ", one would have to systematically multiply the theoretical sn ii mass yields of s by @xmath11 0.34 and of ne by @xmath112.7 .",
    "these suggested corrections for ne and s are also listed in table 4 .",

    "the ni abundance is 1.34@xmath51 solar and the fe abundance is 0.47@xmath52 solar with a @xmath53 , for a vmekal + cflow model . as can be seen in table 3 the fe and ni abundance measurements in the central regions obtained with _",
    "asca _ and _ sax _ for the same spectral models agree very well .      since the cd galaxy in perseus , ngc 1275 , has a seyfert - like spectrum ( rubin et al . 1977 ) , we added a power - law component to the absorbed vmekal + cflow model .",
    "the addition of the power law component to the simultaneous giss and sis 1 fittings has a general effect of decreasing the temperature of the hot component ( of the cflow model ) and does not improve the spectral fittings ( @xmath54 or @xmath55 1495 for 1333 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "however , the inclusion of the power law component introduces large uncertainties in the determination of ni & fe abundances and , especially , the power law slope , which are found to be 1.5@xmath560.7 solar , 0.47@xmath560.05 solar and 2.6@xmath57 , respectively . in order to understand the reasons for the high uncertainties on these parameters introduced by the power law component , we fitted the spectra obtained with giss and sis 1 separately .",
    "the individual spectral fittings indicated that the gis 2&3 are insensitive to the inclusion of the power law .",
    "furthermore , the introduction of the power law component increases the uncertainties of the ni abundance determination very strongly ( 90% confidence range for ni is 0.1 - 2.8 ) .",
    "the siss , on the other hand , are less sensitive to the cflow model than to the power law component .",
    "there is a significant improvement in the spectral fittings with the addition of the power law component .",
    "however , the ni abundance ( @xmath11 1.6 ) as well as the other individual abundances are similar to the those obtained without the power law model .    the allowed low ni abundance is a consequence of the inclusion of the power law component in the joint spectral fittings and seems to be due to different instrumental sensitivities in the spectral fittings to the combination cflow + power models , i.e. , an artifact of the spectral fittings , which also generates large uncertainties in the best - fit values of the power law slope ( varying from 0.9 to 3 ) .",
    "since the introduction of the power law component does not improve significantly the simultaneous giss + sis 1 spectral fittings and introduces artificial large uncertainties on the determination of the best - fit ni abundances we do not include the power law component when determining the sn ia fe mass fraction .",
    "however , since the power law component poses a new undesired uncertainty to both mechanisms ( resonant scattering and w7 sn ia enrichment ) proposed to explain the excess flux at @xmath11 8 kev , in the cluster central regions , we will consider its possible effects on the ni and ni / fe measurements when checking the validity of the delayed detonation models ( below ) .    in order to compare",
    "the two above mentioned competing mechanisms and to estimate the effect that a power law component would have in the abundance ratios involving ni we extracted spectra from a large region ( radius of 20@xmath1 ) around ngc 1275 in the central pointing .",
    "the size of the region is large enough so that the directional number of  photons is conserved and resonant scattering should have no effect on the  ratio .",
    "the abundance ratios derived from this region , however , are emission measured weighted averages and are highly biased towards the values of the abundance ratios in the cluster central regions . the best - fit values of si , fe , ni and their ratios obtained from the spectral fittings of the 0 - 20@xmath1 region are shown in table 5 .",
    "the spectral fittings are significantly worse ( @xmath58 ) than those for the central 4@xmath1 .",
    "the observed ni / fe ratio ( 3.9@xmath59 ) corresponds to a sn ia fe mass fraction of 0.73@xmath60 , which is consistent with that derived from the central 4@xmath1 .",
    "this high value for the ni / fe ratio is inconsistent with all delayed detonation models , independently of resonant scattering effects .",
    "the inclusion of a power law component ( with a best - fit slope of @xmath61 ) improves significantly the spectral fittings ( @xmath62 ) and has the effect of lowering somewhat the ni abundance and , therefore , the ni / fe ratio to 2.9@xmath59 , which is consistent with a radial decrease in sn ia fe mass fraction ( figure 1 ) .",
    "however , even the lower ni / fe ratio obtained with the addition of the power law component is in contradiction with the delayed detonation models .",
    "if the power law slope is fixed at higher values the ni / fe ratios measured are even higher .",
    "so , _ the average ni / fe ratio is inconsistent with the delayed detonation sn ia explosion models independently of the resonant scattering effect and also of the inclusion of a power law component in the spectral fittings . _",
    "the comparative spectral analysis of the large region versus the central region clarifies the question of whether a chemical gradient exists in the perseus cluster .",
    "the average ( 0 - 20@xmath1 ) si / fe ratio measured is 1.83@xmath63 ( implying an emission measure weighted average sn ia fe mass fraction of 0.57@xmath64 ) .",
    "this value is significantly ( @xmath1290% confidence ) higher than that obtained in the central regions ( si / fe @xmath65 1.37@xmath66 ) , indicating _ the presence of a chemical gradient in the intracluster gas of perseus , where sn ia ejecta is more concentrated towards the central regions of the cluster . _",
    "some of the possible scenarios , proposed to explain the abundance and chemical gradient mentioned before could be better constrained by determining the abundance radial profiles for different elements and analyzing the sn ia and ii fe mass - to - light ratio distribution for the cluster .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "nevertheless , at least two difficulties are apparent if stripping models are used to explain the central abundance and chemical gradients ( dupke & white 2000b ) .",
    "firstly , the fe abundances measured in most early - type galaxies by _ asca _ ( loewenstein et al .  1994 ; matsumoto et al.1997 ) and _ rosat _ ( davis & white 1996 ) are lower ( 0.20.4 solar ) than the abundance observed at the cluster center ( @xmath67 solar ) .",
    "furthermore , there is evidence of abundance gradients in elliptical galaxies themselves ( e.g. in ngc 4636 , matsushita et al.1997 ) , so that most stripped gas will have even lower abundances than indicated by the global x - ray fe abundances of elliptical galaxies .",
    "secondly , the efficiency of ram - pressure stripping is dependent on the icm density , which rises strongly towards the central regions .",
    "the difference in fe abundances measured in inner and outer regions is mild ( a factor of @xmath68 ) and might be expected to be larger if stripping were important .",
    "we have shown above that the high  to  ratio observed in perseus , which has been attributed to resonant scattering of the , can also be explained by a supersolar ni / fe abundance ratio due to the products of sne ia . in this section",
    "we consider the arguments for and against these two explanations .",
    "the first point to make is that this is independent of the question of whether there is a significant contribution from sn ia products",
    ". the abundance ratios of elements other than ni can be used to measure the relative contributions from sn ia and sn ii .",
    "so , the basic choice lies between a ) resonance scattering and delayed detonation sn ia explosion models or b ) no resonance scattering and convective deflagration sn ia explosion model .    delayed detonation sn ia explosion models ( and alternatives which have low ni production ) have certainly been espoused by sn theorists .",
    "however , recent treatment of turbulence effects in subsonic flames in delayed detonation models shows that the transition to detonation requires unusually high turbulent velocity fluctuations ( lisewski , hillebrandt & weaver 2000 ) .",
    "resonant scattering optical depth is a function of the gas density and , therefore , should fall to the optical thin value at regions away from the cluster s center .",
    "observations of the radial distribution of the sn ia gas contamination in other clusters also show a decrease in sn ia fe mass fraction as the distance from the center increases ( dupke 1998 , dupke & white 2000b , finoguenov , david , & ponman 2000 ) .",
    "this seems also to be the case for perseus as indicated by significantly lower si / fe value in the central 4@xmath1 when compared to the average value observed for the whole cluster ( 0 - 20@xmath1 ) .",
    "this `` chemical gradient '' is expected from models proposed to explain the central sn ia ejecta excess ( e.g. suppressed sn ia winds , ram - pressure stripping , cd stellar mass loss ) .",
    "therefore , if one assumes the classical w7 sn ia model , both scenarios , sn ia enrichment and resonant scattering , predict that , observationally , the excess flux in the -  line complex should decrease radially .    against the resonance scattering scenario",
    "is the fact that simulations of its expected effect on clusters ( where ni abundances are set to solar ) show that resonant scattering alone can not explain the high  to  ratio observed ( tawara et al .",
    "1997 , furuzawa et al . 1997 ) and , in particular , in perseus ( akimoto et al . 1997 , 1999 ) for the central regions of 78 clusters ( figure 1 of akimoto et al . 1999 ) can be well described by an optically thin plasma with a central ni / fe ratio of @xmath35 2 . ] .",
    "furthermore , if the x - ray emitting gas has turbulent velocities of a few hundred km / s then any resonance scattering will be totally suppressed ( gilfanov et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "if we use fe , si , and o alone to set the relative fractions of sn ii and sn ia products and then use these relative fractions to predict ni relative abundances we obtain a very good match to what is observed if the w7 model for sn ia is assumed . therefore , resonant scattering can contribute significantly to the relative enhancement of the -  line complex only if delayed detonations are assumed .",
    "chemically w7 and wdd models differ in the ejected mass yields of some elements .",
    "in particular wdds produce more ni than w7 and , in a smaller degree , more si .",
    "if resonant scattering were the mechanism responsible for the apparent high ni abundances in the central cluster regions , and , therefore , wdd models were preferred , then we should expect that if one extracted spectrum from a region large enough , such as to be immune to resonant scattering , the observed ni / fe abundance ratio would be smaller and , necessarily , consistent with wdd models . in the previous paragraph we showed that the ni / fe ratio measured within the 0 - 20@xmath1 region is not consistent with any wdd model , even when the uncertainties from the power law component are incorporated .",
    "this shows that delayed detonation models are not preferred over the w7 model and strongly suggests that resonant scattering has a much smaller contribution ( if any ) to the observed fe abundance measurements than that claimed by molendi et al .",
    "molendi et al .",
    "determination of the resonant scattering in perseus was based on spectral fittings of a blend of fe and ni lines , assuming the contribution of the  line to this blend to be small , therefore , requiring _ a priori _ , a specific sn enrichment type ( either sn ii or delayed detonation sn ia ) .",
    "one of the goals of our analysis is to determine the very sn type contamination of the icm .",
    "we showed that the delayed detonation sn ia explosion models are not adequate to explain the observations while the `` classical '' w7 sn ia model can explain what we observe without the need to invoke resonant scattering .",
    "in this work we have shown that    1 .",
    "the central region ( 0 - 4@xmath1 ) of the perseus cluster is significantly enriched with ejecta from sn ia , which produce more than half ( @xmath69 ) of the total iron .",
    "the observed ni / fe ratio is in excellent agreement with the observed ratios of other elements involving fe , si , ni and o in predicting the sn ia fe mass fraction in the central regions of perseus . the ni / fe ratio observed is @xmath11 3.4 . 3 .   the ni / fe ratio is consistent with the theoretically predicted values for sn ia models with fast flame - speed ( w7 ) but not with delayed detonation explosion models . 4 .",
    "the average si / fe ratio in perseus is significantly ( @xmath3590% confidence ) higher than in the central regions , which indicates that the central fe abundance gradient is accompanied by a chemical gradient , i.e. , the sn ia contamination has a radial decline in perseus . 5 .",
    "it is not necessary to invoke resonant scattering in the   line since the high /  ratio can be totally attributed to substantial icm contamination from sn ia ejecta .",
    "although the high central ni abundances can be fully explained by sn ia enrichment , the current data do not allow a precise quantification of the relative contribution of resonant scattering , which can be done only with very high resolution x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "if resonance scattering is important it will always provide the largest effect at the peak density of the cluster .",
    "therefore , clusters with high resonant scattering optical depth should show , observationally , a ni abundance profile decreasing with radius ( within the resolution of current x - ray spectrometers ) .",
    "therefore , additional discriminating evidence between the two scenarios can be provided by observation of other clusters that show no central sn ia ejecta dominance and , at the same time , have large resonant scattering optical depth .",
