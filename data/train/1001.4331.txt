    "in the sun , the typical distribution of acoustic power of photospheric oscillations peaks at around 5 min @xcite with a general decrease to negligible power at higher frequencies .",
    "this behaviour of the acoustic spectrum has been understood in terms of trapped oscillations in a cavity @xcite .",
    "the eigen - functions corresponding to the band of oscillations in the region of 5 minutes peak in the convection zone , which seems to be the dominant source of excitation of the solar oscillations ( goldreich , murray , and kumar , 1994 ) . apart from these normal modes of oscillations ( @xmath2 modes ) , researchers have found the presence of high - frequency oscillations ( frequencies higher than the solar - photospheric acoustic cutoff at about 5.3 mhz ) in the solar - acoustic spectrum @xcite .",
    "unlike the normal @xmath2 modes , the driving mechanism of these high - frequency solar oscillations is still not well established .",
    "@xcite suggest that the high - frequency waves are partly reflected by the sudden change in temperature at the transition region between the chromosphere and the corona .",
    "@xcite explain these high - frequency waves as an interference phenomenon between ingoing and outgoing waves from a localized source just beneath the photosphere .",
    "@xcite suggested that large solar flares can stimulate free modes of oscillation of the entire sun , by causing a thermal expansion that would drive a compression front to move into the solar interior .",
    "several researchers have tried to study the effect of flares on the acoustic - velocity oscillations of the sun .",
    "the progress in this field escalated recently with the advent of continuous data from dedicated instruments such as mdi ( michelson and doppler imager ) @xcite on board _ soho ( solar and heliospheric observatory ) _ spacecraft and gong ( global oscillation network group ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported an average increase in the power of intermediate - degree modes after a major flare ( of class x13/3b ) using a few hours of solar - oscillations data obtained by the dunn telescope at national solar observatory/ sacramento peak , usa .",
    "@xcite could not detect acoustic - wave excitation from an x - class flare .",
    "@xcite reported the first detection of `` solar quakes '' inside the sun , caused by the x2.6 flare of 9 july 1996 , using the mdi dopplergrams . following this result",
    ", @xcite found an acoustic source associated with a flare using seismic images produced with helioseismic - holography technique .",
    "application of ring - diagram analysis showed that the power of the global @xmath2 modes appears to be larger in several flare - producing active regions as compared with the power in non - flaring regions of similar magnetic field strength @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xcite have reported emission of seismic waves from large solar flares using helioseismic holography . some of the large solar flares have been observed to produce enhanced high - frequency acoustic velocity oscillations in localized parts of active regions @xcite .",
    "further , @xcite reported large downflows associated with seismic sources during the major flare ( of class x17.6/4b ) of 28 october 2003 .",
    "@xcite report co - spatial evolution of seismic sources and h - alpha flare kernels during the aforementioned flare event .",
    "a search for a correlation between the energy of the low - degree @xmath2 modes and flares using velocity observations of the sun remained inconclusive @xcite .",
    "the study of low - degree high - frequency ( ldhf ) waves in the sun is important as this can bring more constraints on the rotation profile between 0.1 and 0.2  r@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the effect of flares on such ldhf waves can provide a clue for the origin of these waves .",
    "recently , @xcite have reported that the correlation between x - ray flare intensity and the energy in the acoustic spectrum of disk - integrated intensity oscillations ( as observed with virgo ( variability of solar irradiance and gravity ) @xcite instrument on board _ soho _ ) is stronger for high - frequency waves than for the well known 5-minute oscillations .",
    "this correlation was obtained for a long time series of 8 years with time variation of power smoothed with a 24-day filter .",
    "this result does not show the immediate consequence of individual flares .",
    "for this , we require shorter time series closely associated with the flares . since , the power spectra are noisier for shorter time series , we need to apply wavelet analysis to the time series .",
    "intensity variations are generally manifestations of pressure variations . however ,",
    "for a medium stratified by gravity , the waves are not pure acoustic waves , but are acousto - gravity waves .",
    "hence , it will be more profitable to look at the velocity oscillations of the solar atmosphere . therefore , in this study , we have searched for the effects of flares in the time series of disk - integrated velocity signals from the solar surface using the full - disk dopplergrams obtained from the mdi instrument .",
    "we have also looked for these effects in disk - integrated velocity observations obtained from the golf ( global oscillation at low frequency ) @xcite instrument on board _ soho_. these studies",
    "have been applied to the major solar flares of 28 october 2003 ( of class x17.6/4b ) , 29 october 2003 ( of class x10/2b ) and 6 april 2001 ( of class x5.6/3b ) that occurred in the solar cycle 23 .",
    "each of the selected events are in decreasing order of flare strength as observed in x - ray ( 1@xmath48  ) by _ goes _ ( geostationary operational environmental satellite ) @xcite satellites .",
    "wavelet and fourier analyses of mdi velocity observations clearly indicate the enhancement in high - frequency global waves in the sun during the flares .",
    "however , this signature of flares is weaker in the case of golf as compared to mdi data .",
    "we have used the sequence of mdi full - disk dopplergrams for three hours spanning the flare obtained on 28 october 2003 ( 10:0013:00  ut ) , 29 october 2003 ( 19:0022:00  ut ) , and 6 april 2001 ( 18:0021:00  ut ) with a cadence of one minute and spatial sampling rate of 2 arcsec per pixel . we have also used three hours of mdi dopplergrams for a quiet period ( non - flaring condition ) as control data . in order to compare the temporal behaviour with the disk - integrated intensity observations by virgo",
    ", we have summed up the velocity signals over all the pixels of the mdi full - disk dopplergrams .",
    "the images are first examined for pixels having cosmic ray hits and such pixels are replaced by interpolation .",
    "a two - point backward difference filter ( difference between two consecutive measurements ) is applied to these sequences of images to enhance the velocity signals from the @xmath2 modes and high - frequency waves above the solar background . the sequence of these filtered doppler images",
    "are then collapsed into a single velocity value , excluding the noisy pixels along the solar limb .",
    "this process is applied to the time series of doppler images for all the three aforementioned flare events as well as the quiet period .",
    "it is believed that by collapsing the full - disk doppler images , the acoustic modes with maximum @xmath5=0,1,2,3 remain while the modes higher than these are averaged out .",
    "thus , the collapsed velocity value should be the representative of the global acoustic modes .",
    "the temporal evolution of these disk - integrated velocity signals for three hours spanning the flare are shown in the upper panel of figures  1(a ) , 2(a ) and 3(a ) and that for the quiet period is shown in figure  4(a ) .",
    "golf instrument measures the disk - integrated line - of - sight velocity of the sun at a cadence of one raw count every 10  s. however , we have rebinned the velocity data from golf for every 60 s to match with mdi .",
    "we have used the same periods of time for both instruments for the flare events of 28 october 2003 , 29 october 2003 , and 6 april 2001 , as well as for the non - flaring condition .",
    "we have worked with the standard velocity time series @xcite as well as the original raw - counting rates .",
    "we have also checked if there was any anomalous behavior during the analyzed periods of time in the housekeeping data .",
    "indeed , during the flare events of 28 - 29 october 2003 , golf raw - counting rates of both photomultipliers suffered an increase in the measurements probably as a consequence of the impact of high - energetic particles . due to these contaminations ,",
    "the standard velocity time series have been filtered out during this period and thus , we have been obliged to work with the raw observations obtained by golf during the aforementioned flare events .",
    "a two - point backward difference filter is applied to the velocity series to remove the effect of the rotation and other slowly varying solar features .",
    "the temporal evolution of these filtered velocity signals for three hours spanning the flare are shown in the upper panels of figures  1(b ) , 2(b ) and 3(b ) and that for the quiet period is shown in figure  4(b ) .      for the time - frequency analysis of the influence of flares on the high - frequency acoustic modes ,",
    "we have applied the wavelet technique @xcite on the velocity time series obtained from mdi and golf as described above .",
    "we have used the morlet wavelet , which is the product of a sine wave and a gaussian function .",
    "we have computed the wavelet power spectrum ( wps ) , which yields the correlation between the wavelet with a given frequency and the data along time . for the different events and the two instruments , we notice the presence of power around 3  mhz , corresponding to the region of the normal @xmath2 modes . concerning the high - frequency waves above 5  mhz , we can study the evolution of their power with time .",
    "we limit our study to the region inside a `` cone of influence '' corresponding to the periods of less than 25% of the time series length for reliability of the periods .",
    "finally , we have also calculated two confidence levels of detection corresponding to the probability of 90% and 50% that the power is not due to noise . thus , we have outlined the regions in the wps where power lies above these confidence levels and these regions are shown in middle panels of the figures  1 - 4(a)&(b ) .",
    "a comparison of the wps for the flare events with that of the quiet period clearly indicates the enhancement of high - frequency waves during these flare events as seen in the data from mdi instrument .",
    "however , in the case of golf data , some short - lived high - frequency waves are sporadically observed during the flares .",
    "the wps is collapsed along time to obtain the global - wavelet power spectrum ( gwps ) .",
    "if some power is present during the whole length of our time series , it would be easily seen in the gwps .",
    "this is nearly similar to the commonly used power spectral density . in the figures  1 - 4(a)&(b )",
    ", the gwps shows a strong peak of the normal @xmath2 modes which are well known to be existing all the time . however , if the power of high - frequency waves increases only a few times along the three hours of the studied data this would not appear as a strong peak in the gwps . in case of mdi data , the gwps for",
    "all the three flare events do show a bump corresponding to the high - frequency waves ( above 5  mhz ) . here again , we have overplotted the significance levels corresponding to probabilities of 90% and 50% .",
    "we notice that the normal @xmath2-mode peak in the gwps is above 90% significance level whereas the high - frequency peak is just below 50% significance level , i.e. , it has at least 50% probability of being due to noise .",
    "however , the gwps estimated from the mdi velocity data during a quiet period ( figure  4(a ) ) does nt show any peak beyond 5  mhz .",
    "this supports the idea that the increase of power in the high frequency regime of the gwps is indeed caused by the flare . in the case of golf data",
    ", we do not observe this signature in the gwps estimated for the flare events as the overall high - frequency signal is weak in these observations .",
    "to see when the high - frequency waves have an increased power during the flare , we have calculated the scale - average time series in the frequency regime 5 - 8  mhz .",
    "basically , it is a collapsogram of the wps along the frequency of the wavelet in the chosen range . for this quantity , we have calculated the confidence level for a 50% probability .",
    "these are shown in the lower panels of the figures  1 - 4(a)&(b ) . here , we observe peaks corresponding to the presence of high - frequency waves in the wps . in general , the mdi data show more closely spaced high - amplitude peaks as compared to the golf data for the flare events , but still mainly around 50% confidence level .",
    "a comparison with the same analysis performed for a quiet period ( non - flaring condition ) neither shows a high - frequency bump beyond 5  mhz in the gwps ( for mdi data ) nor high - amplitude peaks in the scale - average time series ( for both , mdi and golf data ) .",
    "thus , in spite of the small confidence levels found during this analysis , it indicates a possible relationship between these excess high - frequency power and the flares .",
    "we have also estimated the fourier power spectrum ( fps ) from the velocity time series obtained by the mdi and golf instruments for the aforementioned flare events and the quiet period .",
    "the fps spectra obtained from the mdi and golf data are respectively shown in the left and right panels of figure  5 . in the estimation of fps spectra",
    ", the power spectral density has not been corrected for the transfer function of the two - point backward difference filter @xcite .",
    "a correction from the backward difference filter will change the slope , thereby affecting the relative amplitudes between the normal @xmath2 modes and the high - frequency waves . here , we study the high - frequency waves in an absolute manner for each event and we do not compare them with the normal @xmath2 modes .",
    "therefore , it does not bias our study .",
    "the fps shown in the figure  5 depicts dominant power in the 3  mhz band which is due to the normal @xmath2 modes .",
    "these fps also show significant peaks in the higher frequency band ( above 5  mhz ) as estimated from mdi data for all the three flare events ( strongest for the 6 april 2001 flare event ) .",
    "however , the golf data show the strong signature only for the flare event of 29 october 2003 . the enhancement of high - frequency power related to the flare of 28 october 2003 has already been seen in the gong velocity data @xcite . here",
    ", we do observe spikes at high - frequency in the fps from the mdi data and some smaller ones from the golf data for these flare events .",
    "these spikes are very weak in the case of a quiet period , as seen in both the data sets ( c.f . , bottom panels of figure  5 ) .",
    "the difference found between the measurements of the two instruments could be a direct consequence of the different heights of the solar atmosphere sampled by each instrument ( ni  i v / s sodium doublet ) .",
    "the golf is observing in the high photosphere and the low chromosphere while the mdi or the gong observes mostly in the deep photosphere close to where virgo is observing .",
    "further analysis will be necessary to understand all the particularities of each seismic measurements ( c.f .",
    "the existence of high - frequency acoustic waves was first discovered in high - degree observations at the big bear solar observatory @xcite and later in golf low - degree disk - integrated observations @xcite .",
    "recently , they have also been seen in bison disk - integrated radial - velocity data @xcite and virgo intensity data @xcite .",
    "however , earlier attempts to find a correlation between the energy of these high - frequency oscillations and flares using disk - integrated velocity observations of the sun had remained unclear @xcite . in our analysis , the enhancement of high - frequency power is clearly seen in the mdi velocity data ( and a feeble enhancement is also seen in the golf velocity data ) during the major flare events .",
    "it is comparable with the flare related enhancements reported by @xcite in disk - integrated intensity oscillations as observed with virgo .",
    "although , in our results the flare induced enhancement signals are seen with a low probability ( around 50% ) , this signature is larger than that seen in non - flaring condition for both the mdi and golf data .",
    "basically , two models have been proposed to account for these low - degree high - frequency oscillations with frequencies higher than the photospheric acoustic cut - off frequency ( @xmath65.3  mhz ) .",
    "the first model proposed by @xcite suggests that the high - frequency waves are partially reflected at the transition region in comparison to the photospheric reflection for ordinary @xmath2 modes .",
    "the other model proposed by @xcite explains the high - frequency waves as an interference phenomenon between ingoing and outgoing waves from a localized source just beneath the photosphere . in either case ,",
    "the amount of energy that is stored in the high - frequency waves is extremely low compared to the amount of energy stored in the normal @xmath2 modes which are powered by the strong turbulence in the convection zone of the sun .",
    "therefore , it is believed that the flare energy will have a larger relative effect at high frequency as the other sources of its excitation are much smaller .",
    "these observations open a new area of study concerning the excitation of global high - frequency waves by local tremors due to major solar flares",
    ". it would be interesting to correlate the epochs of enhancement of high - frequency waves with episodes of flare energy release , using a similar analysis with hard x - ray data .",
