    "scalar - tensor gravity ( stg ) introduces a scalar field that is nonminimally coupled to curvature and thus can be interpreted as an additional mediator of gravitational interaction besides the usual metric tensor .",
    "it is well known that by rescaling of the metric and reparametrization of the scalar field , the theory can be presented in different conformal frames and parametrizations.@xcite despite an extensive use of this property as a convenient calculational tool , there lingers a conceptual issue of what is the precise relation of different frames and parametrizations to the observable world and to each other .",
    "one may interpret the change of a conformal frame and reparametrization as a change of coordinates in some abstract generalized field space . from this point of view",
    "the confusion arises from the fact that the theory has not been formulated in a covariant way with respect to that abstract space .",
    "one possible path to proceed has been to introduce conformally invariant variables.@xcite in this review we summarize our work on quantities in stg@xcite and multiscalar - tensor gravity ( mstg)@xcite that are invariant not only under the conformal rescaling but also under the scalar field redefinition .",
    "three basic invariants and invariant metric enable us to formulate the theory and express physical observables independently of the choice of frame and parametrization .",
    "the most generic `` first generation '' stg where the scalar field @xmath0 has no derivative couplings , is described by four arbitrary functions @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 in the action ( where @xmath5 stands for the matter fields)@xcite [ fl_moju ] s = d^4x()r- b()g^__- 2 ^ -2v ( ) + s_m .",
    "the two dimensionful constants @xmath6 , @xmath7 have been chosen such as to make @xmath0 dimensionless .",
    "let us assume that @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11",
    ".    by conformal rescaling and scalar field redefinition one can fix two out of the four functions to get different frames and parametrizations .",
    "for instance jordan frame brans - dicke - bergmann - wagoner parametrization ( jf bdbw ) is obtained by @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 . on the other hand einstein frame canonical parametrization ( ef canonical )",
    "has @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "under conformal rescaling of the metric and scalar field reparametrization g_= e^2|(|)|g _ , = |f(| ) , [ transformations ] the functions transform as@xcite |(| ) & = & e^2|(| ) a ( |f ( | ) ) , +         we can inspect these rules to find combinations which remain invariant .",
    "it is convenient to write out three basic independent quantitites , invariant under rescaling and reparametrization:@xcite [ i_1 ] _ 1 ( ) & & , [ i_2 ] _ 2 ( ) , + [ i_3 ] _ 3 ( ) & & ( ) ^ d. here @xmath20 signals nonminimal coupling , i.e.  the constant @xmath21 case is equivalent to a scalar field minimally coupled to curvature .",
    "next , @xmath22 means nonvanishing potential , related to the fact that a scalar without mass and self - interactions remains so in all frames and parametrizations .",
    "finally , @xmath23 is a useful quantity that frequently appears in various equations and formulas .    on the basis of the three basic invariants it is possible to define infinitely many more invariants by ( a ) taking some function of them , @xmath24 , ( b ) forming a quotient of the derivatives with respect to the scalar field , @xmath25 , ( c ) taking an integral @xmath26 .",
    "so , for example@xcite _ 4 = , [ i_5 ] _ 5 ( ) ^2 = .",
    "are also invariants , i.e.  do not change under the transformations ( [ transformations ] ) .",
    "one may also introduce an additional invariant object involving the metric . for instance taking @xmath27 and using it to define invariant curvature , the action ( [ fl_moju ] ) can be expressed via invariant quantities as s = d^4x - 2^__3 _ _ 3 - 2 ^ -2_2 [ invariant_action_functional ] + s_m . taking @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and varying w.r.t .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 gives invariant field equations that are equivalent to the known equations in particular frames and parametrizations.@xcite",
    "physically observable quantities should be independent of the choice of frame and parametrization , hence they should be expressible as functions of the invariants .",
    "indeed , the effective newton s constant and parameterized post - newtonian ( ppn ) parameters , computed in case of the point mass source for jf bdbw parametrization for general kinetic coupling function and potential@xcite can be translated into the invariant formalism as@xcite [ stg ppn geff gamma ] g _ & = & _ 1 ( 1 + _ 5 e^-m_r ) , -1 = -_1_5 , + [ stg ppn beta ] - 1 & = & e^-2 m_r - _ 1 ^ 2_5 ( r ) , where @xmath32 can be understood as an effective mass and @xmath33 is a bit cumbersome radius dependent term .",
    "the scalar field dynamics in flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmology without matter is given by ( @xmath34 expanding / contracting universe)@xcite [ skalaarvalja_kosmo_vorrand_invariantidena ] _ 3 = - _ 3 - , where @xmath35 .",
    "we may linearize this equation around the fixed point at @xmath36 : @xmath37 .",
    "the solutions of the linearized equation are [ solution_for_linearized_equation_in_terms_of_invariants ] _ 3 ( ) = m_1 e^^_+ + m_2 e^^_- , with the eigenvalues @xmath38_{\\phi_0}$ ] .",
    "the invariant formalism makes it clear that given a particular stg the existence of the fixed point as well as the physically observable qualities of the approximate solutions ( attractor , repeller , etc ) and periods of the oscillations are independent of the parametrization .    to express the solution ( [ solution_for_linearized_equation_in_terms_of_invariants ] ) in terms of the scalar field we can taylor expand ( ) - _ 0 = .",
    "3 ( ) + .()^|__0 _ 3 ^ 2 ( ) . [ taylor_back ] note that the fixed point condition can be satisfied in two ways : @xmath39 : @xmath40 , and @xmath41 : @xmath42 .",
    "for example in jf bdbw parametrization the first is equivalent to @xmath43 , while the second to @xmath44 . in the first case @xmath39",
    "the solution for @xmath45 is linear , but for @xmath41 the first term in eq .",
    "( [ taylor_back ] ) vanishes and the solution will be nonlinear.@xcite however , one must bear in mind that the value of the scalar field itself is not observable , and linear / nonlinear behavior stems from the choice of parametrization .",
    "a thorough analysis shows how the solutions for @xmath39 and @xmath41 actually transform into each other under conformal rescaling and reparametrization.@xcite",
    "extending the action ( [ fl_moju ] ) to @xmath46 scalar fields @xmath47 gives multiscalar - tensor gravity,@xcite @xmath48 \\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we assume @xmath49 to be an invertible symmetric square matrix function of @xmath50 .",
    "the action ( [ mstg_flanagan_action ] ) is invariant under local weyl rescaling and reparametrization of the scalar fields , @xmath51 while the arbitrary functions transform as@xcite [ mstg_flanagan_transformations ] ( |(| ) ) & = & e^-2|(|)|(| ) , + ( |(| ) ) & = & e^-4|(| ) |(| ) , + ( |(| ) ) & = & |(| ) - |(| ) , + _",
    "ab(|(| ) ) & = & e^-2|(| ) ( |f^c_,a ) ^-1 ( |f^d_,b ) ^-1 |b_cd(| ) - 6 |_,c    & & .",
    "+ 3 ( |_,d |_,c + |_,c |_,d ) , where the comma @xmath52 denotes partial derivative w.  r.  t.  @xmath47 . again",
    ", by invoking these transformations it is possible to express the theory in various parametrizations , e.g.  the jordan frame bdbw type or einstein frame canonical parametrization.@xcite",
    "analogously to the single field case , we can construct multiscalar quantities which remain invariant under the transformations ( [ conformal_and_scalar_fields_transformations ] ) , like@xcite @xmath53 any function of these will also give an invariant , e.g.@xmath54 however , in comparison with the single field case , the third invariant ( [ i_3 ] ) and the other two rules ( b ) , ( c ) for constructing further invariants do not directly generalize to the multifield case .",
    "note that under the scalar reparametrizations alone @xmath55 transforms as a second order covariant tensor and can be considered to be the metric of the space of fields @xmath47 ( like for the @xmath56-models minimally coupled to gravity ) .",
    "but under the local weyl rescaling of the spacetime metric it gains additive terms .",
    "therefore it is more reasonable to introduce the metric of the space of fields and its transformation rule as @xmath57 we assume @xmath58 to be an invertible matrix and denote its inverse by @xmath59 . these can be used to formally raise , lower , and contract scalar field indexes , define a covariant derivative in the space of scalar fields , etc .",
    "now we can generalize the third invariant @xmath30 to be an indefinite integral @xmath60 in fact , any combination of the fields , which happens to be a `` scalar '' in the space of fields , e.g.@xmath61 remains invariant under the transformations ( [ conformal_and_scalar_fields_transformations ] ) . in this way",
    "we may construct many more invariant quantities.@xcite",
    "by invoking an insightful mapping technique , it is again possible to reconstruct the expressions for the effective gravitational constant and ppn parameters for mstg ( without potential):@xcite [ mstg_ppn_in_generic_frame ] g _ & = & , - 1 = -2 ( ) , + - 1 & = & .",
    "this result reduces to the earlier results in the literature for einstein frame,@xcite and jordan frame@xcite , as well as to eqs .",
    "( [ stg ppn geff gamma ] ) , ( [ stg ppn beta ] ) in the single field case . a further inclusion of the potential is also possible .",
    "once again we conclude that physical observables are frame and parametrization independent since they transform as invariants .",
    "it would be interesting to apply the formalism of invariants to study the contentious issues of cosmological perturbations and quantum corrections",
    ". it would be also interesting to generalize it for stgs and mstgs with derivative couplings and disformal invariance ( horndeski and beyond ) .",
