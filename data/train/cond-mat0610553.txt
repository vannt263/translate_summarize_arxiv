    "a parametrically modulated oscillator is one of the simplest physical systems that display spontaneous breaking of time - translation symmetry . when the modulation is sufficiently strong , the oscillator has two states of vibrations at half the modulation frequency , the period two states @xcite .",
    "they are identical except for the phase shift by @xmath3 , but for each of them the symmetry with respect to time translation by the modulation period is broken .",
    "fluctuations of the oscillator lead to switchings between the states .",
    "switching rates are equal by symmetry , for stationary fluctuations .",
    "the switchings ultimately make the state populations equal , thus restoring the full time - translation symmetry .",
    "experimental studies of fluctuation - induced switchings in classical parametrically modulated systems were done for trapped electrons @xcite , optically trapped atoms @xcite , and microelectromechanical systems @xcite .",
    "the obtained switching rates are in good agreement with the theory @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy of period two states can be lifted if , in addition to parametric modulation at frequency @xmath0 , a system is driven at frequency @xmath2 . in the frame oscillating at frequency @xmath2 the period two states and the additional field look static .",
    "the system reminds an ising ferromagnet , with the period two states and the additional field playing the roles of spin orientations and an external magnetic field , respectively .",
    "one can expect that the role of the direction of the magnetic field is played by the phase of the additional field counted off from the phase of one of the period two states .",
    "depending on the field phase , one or the other state should be predominantly occupied .    in this paper",
    "we study resonant symmetry lifting in a parametric oscillator , which occurs where the frequency of the additional field is close to the oscillator eigenfrequency .",
    "the field makes the rates of switching between the period two states , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , different from each other . in turn",
    ", this leads to the difference of the stationary state populations .",
    "this difference may become large even for a comparatively weak field , as can be surmised from the analogy with the problem of a ferromagnet . there",
    "the change of the state populations becomes large once the energy difference of the states due to an external magnetic field exceeds @xmath6 , which happens already for weak fields where this difference itself is small compared to the internal energy .",
    "in contrast to the case of a ferromagnet , the energy of a parametrically modulated oscillator is not conserved and its stationary distribution is not of the boltzmann form .",
    "however if the fluctuation intensity is small , the dependence of the switching rates on this intensity is often of the activation type , see refs .  ,   and papers cited therein .",
    "this applies not only to a classical , but also to a quantum oscillator , where switching is due to quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "an additional field changes the effective switching activation energies , and once this change exceeds the fluctuation intensity , the overall change of the switching rates becomes large .",
    "the effect is particularly strong if the field is resonant .    in what follows we",
    "develop a theory of the switching rates @xmath7 for a classical oscillator .",
    "we find the dependence of the switching activation energies on the amplitude , phase , and frequency of the additional field and on the oscillator parameters .",
    "we first study the symmetry lifting by the field at frequency @xmath8 .",
    "of particular interest here is the vicinity of the bifurcation point where the period two states merge , as in this range the rates @xmath7 are comparatively large and easy to control .",
    "we are also interested in the situation where the additional field frequency @xmath1 is not exactly equal to @xmath2 . here",
    ", the field - induced modulation of the switching probabilities causes oscillations of the state populations at frequency @xmath9 .",
    "such oscillations , superimposed on the oscillator vibrations at frequency @xmath2 in period two states , lead to vibrations at frequency @xmath10 , i.e. , to a strong effective fluctuation - induced three - wave mixing .",
    "the amplitude of the population oscillations becomes small when @xmath9 largely exceeds the switching rates .",
    "still the rates themselves may be significantly changed by the additional field .",
    "of primary interest in this case are the rates @xmath7 averaged over the period @xmath11 and their dependence on the additional field amplitude @xmath12 and frequency @xmath1 .",
    "one may expect that , as in the case of equilibrium systems @xcite , the rate change is quadratic in @xmath12 for small @xmath12 and corresponds to effective heating of the system by the field . for underdamped equilibrium systems this heating can be resonant , as seen for modulated josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "however , for somewhat stronger fields the change of the logarithm of the switching rate should become linear in @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this happens when the properly scaled field amplitude exceeds temperature .",
    "we show that , for a parametric oscillator , the activation energies are indeed linear in the additional field amplitude @xmath12 once it is not too small ( but is also not too large ) .",
    "when the oscillator is underdamped , the factor multiplying @xmath12 displays a characteristic resonant frequency dependence .",
    "we develop a technique that allows us to find this dependence in an explicit form , for the considered nonequilibrium system .",
    "the asymptotic analytical results are compared with the results of numerical calculations of the activation energies .    in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the langevin equation for a parametrically modulated nonlinear oscillator in the rotating frame and give the general expression for the probability of switching between coexisting stable vibrational states . in sec .",

    "( [ eq : g_function ] ) we used the rotating wave approximation and disregarded fast oscillating terms @xmath34 . in the quantum formulation , the eigenvalues of @xmath35 give the scaled quasienergy of the system @xcite , and in what follows for brevity we call @xmath36 quasienergy .",
    "we will assume that the interaction with a bath that leads to dissipation of the oscillator is sufficiently weak , so that the oscillator is underdamped .",
    "then under fairly general assumptions @xcite , in the rotating frame dissipation is described by an instantaneous friction force ( no retardation ) .",
    "also the noise spectrum is generally practically flat in a comparatively narrow frequency range of width @xmath37 centered at @xmath20 ; this is the most interesting range , since the oscillator filters out noise at frequencies far from this range .",
    "therefore with respect to the slow time @xmath29 the noise can be assumed white .",
    "the oscillator motion is described by the langevin equation , which can be conveniently written in a vector form as @xmath38 with @xmath39 here all vectors have two components , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , while @xmath43 is the permutation tensor , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",

    "in the laboratory frame the periodic stable states @xmath73 correspond to oscillator vibrations at frequency @xmath2 weakly modulated at frequency @xmath74 .",
    "they have spectral components at @xmath75 , and the  mirror \" frequency @xmath10 .    we will limit ourselves to the analysis of switching in the parameter range ( [ eq : mu_b ] ) . in this range escape from a period two state",
    "leads to switching to a different period two state . for @xmath76 escape may result in a transition to the zero - amplitude state ( from which the system may also escape to one of the period two states ) .",
    "the results of the paper immediately extend to this range , but this extension will not be discussed",
    ". therefore we use the terms  escape \" and  switching \" intermittently .",
    "the noise @xmath77 leads to fluctuations about the stable states and to interstate transitions . when the noise is weak , fluctuations have small amplitude on average .",
    "interstate transitions require large outbursts of noise and therefore occur infrequently .",
    "for gaussian @xmath78-correlated noise the probability of a transition from @xmath79th to @xmath80th stable period two state has activation dependence on the noise intensity @xmath53 and is given by the expression @xcite @xmath81 the quantity @xmath82 is the activation energy of a transition .",

    "when the additional field @xmath49 is weak , the activation energy @xmath82 is close to its value @xmath96 for @xmath97 , which is the same for the both states @xmath98 . even though the correction to @xmath96 is small compared to @xmath96",
