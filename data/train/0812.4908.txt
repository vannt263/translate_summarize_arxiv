    "kerr - schild ( ks ) geometry is a background for the rotating black - hole ( bh ) solutions . on the other hand , the kerr - newman solution has gyromagnetic ratio @xmath6 as that of the dirac electron , and the ks geometry acquires central role as a model of spinning particle in gravity , in particular , as a dirac - kerr model of electron @xcite .",
    "consistency of quantum theory with gravity is one of the principal problems of modern physics , and in this paper we discuss a way to progress in this direction , showing that consistency of the dirac - kerr system for a massive particle ( electron ) may be provided by a twistor - string source formed by the _ massless _ solutions of the dirac equation aligned with the twistor structure of the ks background . in many respects",
    "this twistor - string is similar to the nair - witten twistor - string model @xcite , which allows us to join to the nair - witten concept on the scattering of the gauge amplitudes in twistor space @xcite , extending this concept to include massive particles .",
    "the ks solutions in 4d are algebraically special solutions of type d which has two ( doubled ) principal null congruences ( pnc ) corresponding to geodesic lines of outgoing or ingoing photons .",

    ". for rotating bh geometry the congruence is twisting which causes the difficulties for its derivation and analysis .",
    "the obtained exact solutions of the einstein - maxwell system of equations @xcite indicate that electromagnetic ( em ) field is not free with respect to the choice of the in or out representation .",
    "the direction of congruence related with em field must be the same as it is for metric , i.e. vector potential of em field @xmath10 has to satisfy the alignment condition , @xcite , @xmath11 since the classical em - fields are determined by the retarded potentials , the in - out symmetry of gravity turns out to be broken and the solutions of the einstein - maxwell system have to be based on the out - congruence , which has important physical consequences .",
    "the structure of kerr congruence for the stationary kerr - newman solution at rest is shown in fig.1 .",
    "it displays very specific twosheetedness of the ks space - time .",
    "the kerr singular ring represents a branch line of space - time , showing that congruence is propagating from negative sheet of metric onto positive one , and the outgoing congruence is analytic extension of the ingoing one .",
    "the ks metrics have a rigid connection with metric of auxiliary minkowski space - time @xmath8 and are practically unfastened from the position of horizon .",
    "ks approach allows one to obtain solutions which are form - invariant with respect to the position of horizons , and even to its presence , which allows one to consider the black - holes and spinning particles without horizon on the common grounds @xcite , as well as perform the analysis of deformations of the black - hole horizon by electromagnetic excitations @xcite .",
    "besides , the twosheetedness of the kerr space reproduces the properties of bh space - times which are desirable from quantum point of view @xcite .",
    "kerr congruence forms a fiber bundle of the ks space - time which is determined by the kerr theorem @xcite .",
    "the lightlike fibers of the kerr congruence are _ real _ twistors ( intersections of the complex conjugated null planes @xcite ) . the kerr theorem gives a rule to generate geodesic and shear - free ( gsf ) null congruences in minkowski space - time @xmath12 due to the specifical form of the ks metrics , these congruences turn out to be also geodesic and shear - free in the curved ks space - times which justifies application of the ks formalism @xcite to solutions of the einstein - maxwell field equations .",
    "the kerr theorem states that any gsf congruence in @xmath13 is determined by some holomorphic generating function @xmath14 of the projective twistor coordinates z =( y , - y v , u + y  ) [ ptw ] , being an analytic solution of the equation @xmath0 in projective twistor space , @xmath1 the variable @xmath15 plays especial role , being projective spinor coordinate @xmath16 and simultaneously the projective angular coordinate y = e^i2 [ y0 ] .the dependence @xmath17 is the output of the kerr theorem which determines the kerr congruence as a field of null directions k_dx^= p^-1(du + d+ y d- y dv ) . [ kpm]the null field @xmath18 may also be expressed in spinor form k^=|^[km ] via the pauli matrices @xmath19 or in the terms of spinor components @xcite k_aa= ^_aak_= _ a |_a .",

    "structure of the kerr - newman solution admits a complex interpretation ( suggested by newman @xcite ) as being generated by a source propagating along a complex world - line @xmath27 and parameters of the quadratic in @xmath15 function @xmath22 may be easily determined from parameters of the world - line @xcite . since a complex world - line @xmath28 in @xmath29",
    "is parametrized by complex time @xmath30 it is really a complex world - sheet with target space @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "thereby , the complex kerr - newman source is equivalent to some complex string .",
    "the ks twistor structure may be described by a complex retarded - time construction , in which twistors of the kerr congruence are the real sections of the complex light cones emanated from the complex world - line . in this way",
    "the kerr - newman solution may be generalized to solutions of a broken @xmath32 supergravity @xcite .",

    "the parameter @xmath5 is linked with angular directions of twistor lines , @xmath35 condition of the existence of real slice for the complex twistors determines the end points of the string @xmath36 @xcite . in the same time , consistency of boundary conditions demands orientifolding this string , by doubling of the world - sheet and turning it into a closed but folded string @xcite .",
    "the joined to the end points of this string twistors form two especial null rays emanated in the north and south directions , @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "they play peculiar role in the ks geometry , controlling parameters of the function @xmath39 and therefore , the twistorial structure in whole .",
    "the corresponding end points of complex string may be marked by quark indices @xmath40 it was obtained in @xcite that the null directions @xmath41 and @xmath42 may be set in the one - to - one correspondence with solutions of the dirac equation @xmath43 putting @xmath44 and @xmath45 one sees that the dirac wave function @xmath46 manages the position , orientation and boost of the kerr source .",
    "it gives a combined dirac - kerr model of spinning particle , in which twistor structure is controlled by the solutions of the dirac equation @xcite .",
    "plane waves of the dirac wave function propagate along the null directions @xmath41 and @xmath47 the essential drawback of this model is that the dirac equation and its wave functions are considered in @xmath13 , instead of the consistent treatment on the ks background .",
    "however , the exact solutions of the massive dirac equation on the kerr background are unknown , and moreover , there are evidences that they can not be consistent with ks structure in principle . note also that the plane waves are inconsistent with the kerr background and there is a related problem with consistency of the conventional fourier transform on the twosheeted kerr background .",
    "consistent solutions of the dirac equation may easily be obtained for the _ massless _ fields which are aligned with the kerr congruence . for the aligned to pnc solutions ,",
    "the dirac spinor @xmath48 has to satisfy the relation @xmath49 which yields , @xcite , @xmath50 and the functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 take the form ( @xcite , app .",

    "the wave solutions have poles at some values of @xmath59 or a series of such poles @xmath60 leading to singular beams along some of twistor lines .",
    "it turns out that the treatment of the massless solutions resolves four problems : 1 ) existence of the exact self - consistent solutions , 2 ) the dirac plane waves on the ks background turn into the lightlike beams concentrating near singular twistor lines with directions @xmath41 and @xmath47 3 ) there appears natural relation to the massless core of superstring theory @xcite and to the massless nair - witten twistor models for scattering , @xcite .",
    "4 ) the dirac massless solutions form the currents and lightlike momenta @xmath61 distributed over sphere , @xmath62 and the total nonzero mass appears after averaging over sphere .",
    "the real source of the kerr - newman solution is a disk , d2-brane boundary ( base ) of a  holographic \" twistor bundle .",
    "the total mass has a few contributions @xcite , including the source itself and the mass - energy of the fields distributed over null rays .",
    "it depends on @xmath63 which may be factorized into angular part @xmath64 and parameter @xmath65 along the complex kerr string .",

    "s^2 ( y ) d y d:|^ : .in the rest frame m = < p^0(y)>= _ s^2(y)dydp^0(y )",
    ". therefore , mechanism of the origin of mass from the massless solutions is similar to that of the dual ( super)string models and corresponds to an initial wheeler s idea of a geon @xcite ( `` mass without mass '' obtained from the averaged em field + gravity ) , as well as to the initial ramond idea on averaging of the local string structure in the dual string models @xcite .",
    "the corresponding wave solutions on the kerr background have singular beams which take asymptotically the form of the exact singular pp - wave solutions by a. peres @xcite .",
    "note , that in general the conventional electromagnetic ( em ) plane waves are not consistent solutions in a curved space - time .",
    "the closest gravitational analogs of the em plane waves are the so called `` exact plane wave '' solutions which are singular at infinity @xcite .",
    "more general are the plane - fronted wave solutions ( pp - waves ) which have the unique symmetry along a covariantly constant null direction @xmath66 ( one can set @xmath67 and , therefore , belong to the ks class @xmath68 they may be regular at infinity , but should have one or more poles in the finite region of the orthogonal to @xmath18 plane @xmath69 these poles determine the position of singular beams . finally , there is a third type of singularity at the front of solution , at a fixed value of the retarded time @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "similar , the conventional spherical ( or even the ellipsoidal ) harmonics can not be exact em solution for the curved kerr background .",
    "so , in principle , the conventional fourier analysis can not be used on the ks space - times .",
    "the ks solutions with singular em beams aligned with a constant null vector may be exact solutions to the coupled system ( em + gravity ) and be considered as analogs of the exact plane waves .",
    "similar , the solutions with singular beams aligned with one or many rays of the kerr congruence turn out to be analogs of the conventional smooth harmonics on the ks space - time .",
    "they form overfilled system of coherent states , and appear in many problems related with the exact solutions on the ks background @xcite .",
    "such beams lead to some unexpected physical consequences . in particular , the beam - like solutions have very strong back reaction on metric and break the topological structure of the black - hole horizons , leading to its topological instability with respect to electromagnetic excitations @xcite .",
    "the ks approach gives as a broad class of the exact em solutions with beams which are consistent with the ks gravity and aligned with twistor structure .",
    "there is a very broad class of exact em solutions with beams coupled with ks gravity .",
    "they are based on the kerr theorem related with the kerr generating functions @xmath22 of higher degrees in @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding ks congruences form multisheeted riemann surfaces , and the resulting space - times turn out to be multisheeted too , which generalizes the known twosheetedness of the kerr geometry .",
    "if we have a system of @xmath72 particles with known parameters @xmath73 , one can form the function @xmath74 as a product of the @xmath72 given blocks @xmath75 with a known dependence @xmath76 f(y )  _ i=1^k f_i ( y ) [ multi ] .",
    "the solution of the equation @xmath24 acquires @xmath77 roots @xmath78 , leading to 2k - sheeted twistor space .",
    "the twistorial structure on the i - th @xmath79 or @xmath80 sheet is determined by the equation @xmath81 and does not depend on the other functions @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , the particle @xmath83 does not feel the twistorial structures of other particles .",
    "similar , singular sources of the @xmath72 kerr s spinning particles are determined by equations @xmath84 which acquires the form _",
    "l=1 ^k f_l = 0 , ^k_i=1 _",
    "li^k f_l d_y f_i = 0 [ leib ] and splits into k independent relations f_i=0,_li^k f_l d_y f_i = 0 [ kind ] , showing that i - th particle does not feel also the singular sources of other particles . the space - time splits on the independent twistorial sheets , and therefore , the twistor structure related to the i - th particle plays the role of its `` internal space '' .",
    "it looks wonderful .",
    "however , it is a natural generalization of the well known twosheetedness of the kerr space - time which remains one of the mysteries of the kerr solution for the very long time . in spite of independence of the twistor structures positioned on the different sheets ,",
    "there is an interaction between them via the singular lightlike beams ( pp - strings ) which appear on the common twistor lines connecting the different sheets of the particles @xcite and play the role of propagators in the nair - witten concept on scattering amplitudes in twistor space @xcite .",
    "multisheetedness of the ks spacetimes can not be interpreted in the frame of classical gravity , however it has far - reaching consequences for quantum gravity @xcite , in which metric is considered as operator @xmath85 leading to an `` effective geometry '' , = g _ .if we consider the kerr - newman solution for an isolated bh or spinning particle , we obtain the smooth space - time apart from the kerr singular ring . however , the exact solution for the kerr - newman source surrounded by remote massive or massless particles will contain series of singular beams along the twistor lines of kerr congruence connecting the kerr source with these remote particles .",
    "analysis of the action of such beams on the bh horizon , given in @xcite , showed that the beams have very strong back reaction on metric and even the very weak beams pierce the horizon changing its topology .",
    "the beams , caused by external particles @xcite , as well as the beams caused by the em zero point field,@xcite , lead to a fine - grained topological fluctuations of horizon .",
    "the exact wave solutions on the ks background show that the beams are coherent and freely overpass the bh horizon @xcite .",
    "it revokes the loss of information inside of bh .    considering metric as an operator",
    ", one has to give an operator meaning to the kerr theorem .",
    "immediate way is to consider the complex position of the kerr source @xmath28 and its velocity @xmath86 as coordinates of a quantum oscillator in spirit of the original ramond paper @xcite .",
    "it leads to the operator meanings of the the equation @xmath24 via coefficients of the function @xmath87 and suggests an operator approach to the kerr - schild equations @xcite .",
    "nair considers @xmath88 as a momentum space of the massless gauge bosons and constructs a classical wzw model over the sphere @xmath88 which is parametrized by the spinor coordinates @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "this construction is close to our field of null directions @xmath90 in @xmath91 which is parametrized by @xmath92 the suggested by nair and witten treatment of the scattering amplitudes in twistor space @xmath93 assumes that the time evolution occurs in @xmath13 along twistor null lines @xmath94 while @xmath88 has only topological duty , playing the role of 2d boundary ( base ) of the `` holographic '' twistor bundle of @xmath95 in the ks twistor structure this boundary is the real disk - like source of the kerr solution , forming the area for complex fields on @xmath88 and the currents . introducing two - dimensional spinor fields",
    "@xmath96 on the sphere , nair considers correlation function = ~[corr]and the local currents @xmath97 showing that ope takes in homogenous spinor coordinates the usual form of the corresponding kac - moody algebra of the wzw model@xcite with central extension @xmath98 in this case the complex - analytic structure of wzw model is lifted from @xmath88 to twistor space @xmath93 over @xmath12 twistor string structure of the ks geometry has much in common with the nair wzw model and witten s twistor string b - model , as well as many specifical features .",
    "however , in all the cases twistor approach displays the principal advantage , providing a natural extension of cft from @xmath88 to @xmath12 since the massless ks twistor space allows one to describe massive spinning particles , the nair - witten treatment of the scattering amplitudes of the gauge fields may be extended in the ks geometry to describe scattering of the gauge fields on the massive black - holes and spinning particles .",
    "we have showed that consistency of the dirac - kerr model for a _ massive _ spinning particle in gravity ( in particular electron ) has to be based on the _ massless _ solutions of the dirac equation aligned with the ks twistor background .",
    "it provides a natural twistor string structure of the ks geometry and generalization of the nair - witten approach to scattering of the gauge amplitudes in twistor space to include massive particles formed from the ks twistor - string bundle .",
    "the considered here aligned solutions of the massless dirac equation were extracted from a fermionic part of the super - kerr - newman solutions to broken @xmath32 supergravity @xcite , which rises interests in the corresponding solutions to supergravity .",
    "self - consistency of the considered aligned solutions shows that the ks twistor structure gives a clue to unification of quantum theory and gravity .",
