    "historically , cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) were discovered because of their _ variability _ , predominantly being large - amplitude variables such as dwarf novae or classical novae , e.g. ugeminorum @xcite , but also some irregular low - amplitude systems such as the polar prototype amherculis @xcite . in 20th century , the rate of discovery of cvs was rather slow until the mid - seventies , @xcite discussed the properties of some 27 systems with known orbital periods , and noted the following points : a strong preference for short - period cvs and a deficiency of cvs in the orbital period range @xmath0h .",
    "it became rapidly clear that the orbital period distribution of cvs is closely related to the evolution of these systems , more specifically to the rate at which cvs lose orbital angular momentum ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "to our knowledge , the first orbital period histogram was published by @xcite , based on data for 33 cvs , clearly showing the presence of a `` period gap '' between @xmath1h .",
    "both the number of discovered cvs and the amount of detailed follow - up studies have rapidly increased since 1980 , stimulating growing activity on the topic of cv evolution .",
    "_ disrupted magnetic braking _ became the standard scenario of cv evolution explaining the presence of the period gap in the context of an abrupt change in the rate of orbital angular momentum loss at @xmath2h ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "while no globally accepted alternative to the standard model exists so far , it has been criticised on the base that ( a ) many of its predictions are in disagreement with the observations and ( b ) it is based on an ad - hoc assumption about the mechanism of orbital angular momentum loss .",
    "the unsettled nature of the field of cv evolution is reflected in the number of alternatives / modifications to the standard model that have been published in the recent years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the purpose of this paper is to review the properties of the known cv population that currently provides the observational input for cv evolution theory , and to assess the impact that several large - scale surveys had / have on this field .",
    "the known population of cvs comprises 531 systems with a known orbital period ( * ? ? ?",
    "qualitatively , the main features of this period distribution ( fig.[f - allcvs ] ) are a sharp cut - off at @xmath3minmin , @xcite ; v485cen , @xmath4min , @xcite ) , which are likely to have evolved through a phase of thermal - timescale mass transfer @xcite    the other ultrashort - period systems have degenerate helium - donors ( amcvn stars , see nelemans this volume ) . ] , a deficit of systems in the gap ( @xmath5% of all cv are have orbital periods in the gap ) , and a steady drop - off in numbers towards longer orbital periods .",
    "the importance of _ observational selection _ effects became apparent , at the latest , with the advent of x - ray satellites . until the mid - seventies cvs were divided into dwarf novae , novae , and nova - like variables .",
    "the discovery of the variable star amherculis being both a strong x - ray source and a strongly magnetic star @xcite added a whole new aspect to cv research .",
    "this illustrates that using the properties of observed cvs to develop the theory of cv evolution is a risky business unless the observational biases are fully understood .",
    "practically all cvs have been discovered using one of the four following criteria : variability , x - ray emission , peculiar colours ( usually meaning _ blue _ ) , and spectroscopic properties ( composite spectra , emission lines ) . dividing the known cvs into four subclasses according to the method of their discovery results in fig.[f - porb_discovery ] . in numbers ,",
    "270 cvs were discovered by variability , 121 by x - ray emission , 91 by colour , and 43 by spectroscopy .",
    "variable _ cvs are predominantly ( 86% ) dwarf / classical novae , the _ x - ray _ cvs comprise 57% magnetic systems , 43% of the _ colour - selected _ cvs are novalike variables , and the spectroscopically selected cvs show no preference for cv subtype .",
    "it is comforting to see that the defining features of cv evolution , period gap and period minimum , are apparently present in all four subsamples .",
    "interesting features are the double - peaked distribution of short - period variable cvs , and the `` spike '' near four hours in the period distribution of colour - selected cvs . however , great care has to be taken when interpreting such features , compare e.g. @xcite s ( @xcite ) prediction with the present - day period distribution of polars with fig.[f - porb_discovery ] .",
    "figure[f - porb_type ] shows the period distribution divided by the degree of white dwarf magnetism .",
    "it has been thoroughly discussed whether magnetic / non - magnetic cvs evolve in the same way ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and differences in their evolution are expected to result in different period distributions .",
    "judging by eye , one would be prone to suggest that the period gap is most clearly pronounced for the non - magnetic dwarf novae / novalike variables , and that the presence of a gap is not clearly evident for the magnetic cvs .",
    "however , comparing the cumulative distributions of different cv sub - samples based on a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov test gives a _ significantly low _",
    "probability for identical parent cv populations ( 0.5% ) _ only _ if swsex stars are included in the category of magnetic cvs .",
    "all other reasonable permutations of cv subclasses result in probabilities for identical parent populations of 16% to 48% .",
    "it is hence of great importance to answer the question whether swsex stars are magnetic or not ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in summary",
    ", the interpretation of the overall cv period distribution and those of different subpopulations in terms of cv evolution is tempting , but despite the substantial observational efforts invested over the last three decades , the number of known and well - studied systems is still too small for a solid statistical assessment .",
    "the photographic @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "palomar - green ( pg ) survey was carried out using the palomar 18(46 cm ) schmidt telescope and covered 10714deg@xmath8 at galactic latitudes @xmath9 and declinations @xmath10 with a limiting magnitude @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "classification spectroscopy was obtained for 1878 blue objects with @xmath12 , resulting in a list of @xmath3 cv candidates .",
    "intensive follow - up studies resulted in the identification of 31 new cvs ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "in addition to these new discoveries , the pg cv sample contains 4 previously known cvs .",
    "the distribution of the pg cvs in galactic coordinates , as well as their orbital period distribution are shown in fig.[f - pg ] .",
    "overall , the pg cv period distribution is similar to that of the entire observed cv population ( fig.[f - allcvs ] ) .",
    "closer inspection of the pg cvs revealed a group of stars that @xcite coined as _ a class of cataclysmic binaries with mysterious , but consistent , behaviour _ : the swsextantis stars , with famous founding members being swsex , dwuma , pxand , and v1315aql . among the defining characteristics of these objects",
    "are that the vast majority of them have orbital periods in the range @xmath13h , they all have high inclinations , they display single - peaked balmer and hei emission lines which suffer from transient orbital phase - dependent absorption in the line cores , moderately strong emission of heii@xmath144686 , and the radial velocities measured from the emission lines are offset by large degrees with respect to the expected motion of the white dwarf .",
    "all these features are very difficult to understand within the `` standard '' cartoon of disc - accreting cvs . despite intensive efforts ,",
    "most of the swsex behaviour is still mysterious , and the growing number of these systems ( see sect.[s - hqscvs ] below ) strongly suggests that these objects represent rather the norm than the exception in the @xmath13h period range .",
    "another species of cvs firstly identified in the pg survey are a number of short - period suuma dwarf novae that have very short and coherent super - cycle periods , such as rzlmi , eruma and v1159ori @xcite .",
    "the frequent outbursts suggest that these systems have , despite their short orbital periods , rather high mass transfer rates .",
    "the rosat / pspc all sky survey was the first imaging survey in soft x - rays ( @xmath15kev ) , and resulted in the identification of 105924 x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "additional x - ray sources were detected in the wfc survey @xcite , as well as in pointed pspc and hri observations . as already outlined in sect.[s - allcvs ] ,",
    "polars and intermediate polars ( ips ) are the most prominent x - ray emitters amongst cvs , and consequently the rosat mission has had a huge impact on the statistics of magnetic cvs , doubling the number of known systems ( @xcite ) . however ,",
    "also a substantial number of non - magnetic cvs were identified during follow - up studies of rosat sources , such as the optically very bright ( @xmath16 ) cv rxj1643.7 + 3402 @xcite , with the total of rosat - lead cv discoveries exceeding 100 .",
    "figure[f - rosatcvs ] shows the orbital period distribution of 69 rosat cvs for which follow - up studies have been carried out .    among the potentially most important discoveries made by rosat",
    "are the two ultra - short period systems rxj0806.3 + 1527 ( @xmath17s , @xcite ) and v407vul = rxj1914.4 + 2456 ( @xmath18s , @xcite ) , which are thought to be double - degenerate cvs .",
    "if these periods should be confirmed to be the orbital periods , these systems would be the shortest period binaries known , and represent excellent candidates for the detection of gravitational waves .",
    "the edinburgh - cape survey has been very similar to the palomar - green survey ( sect.[s - pgcvs ] ) in scope and specifications .",
    "the imaging survey was carried out using the 1.2 m uk schmidt telescope at the aao , obtaining @xmath6 and @xmath7 photographic plates with a limiting magnitude of @xmath19 and covering @xmath9 , @xmath20 ; spectroscopic and photometric follow - up observations have been obtained at saao for objects with @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "a total of 27 cvs are contained in the ec survey , of which 15 new discoveries @xcite .",
    "period determinations exist so far for about half of the new systems ( fig.[f - eccvs ] ) .",
    "it is intriguing that most of the ec cvs with a measured orbital period are found near @xmath23h , i.e. the range where the pg survey established swsextantis stars as a homogeneous class of objects ( sect.[s - pgcvs ] ) .",
    "it is not yet clear how many of the ec cvs may share the defining properties of the swsex stars .",
    "an object of particular interest that has emerged from the ec survey is the eclipsing detached white dwarf / red dwarf binary ec134711258 .",
    "@xcite presented a very detailed follow - up analysis of this object , which suggests that its donor star is very close to being roche - lobe filling , and that the white dwarf is rotating fairly rapidly .",
    "combining both pieces of evidence , @xcite suggested that ec134711258 may be a hibernating cv . confirming this hypothesis would be extremely important in the context of @xcite s ( @xcite ) nova hibernation scenario",
    "the hamburg quasar survey ( hqs ) is an objective prism schmidt survey carried out with the 80 cm schmidt telescope at calar alto , covering @xmath24 at @xmath25 and @xmath26 with a limiting magnitude of @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the spectral range covered by the photographic plates is @xmath28 , and all fields were observed at least twice to allow the investigation of variability .",
    "@xcite selected cv candidates from the hqs based on ( 1 ) the detection of balmer line emission and ( 2 ) blue colour plus variability .",
    "identification spectroscopy of these candidates , primarily carried out using the calar alto 2.2 m telescope , led to the identification of 53 new cvs .",
    "@xcite carefully investigated the cv detection efficiency of the hqs as well as possible selection effects using 84 previously known cvs contained in the survey , and found that the applied selection criteria recover @xmath29% of the known short - period ( @xmath30h ) cvs .",
    "this fraction drops to @xmath31% above the period gap , as many disc - dominated long - period cvs have weak or no balmer emission .",
    "a conservative estimate of the completeness is that the hqs allows to identify all cvs with @xmath22 and an @xmath32 equivalent width @xmath33 .",
    "so far the periods of 40 new hqs cvs have been measured ( fig.[f - hqscvs ] ) , follow - up studies of the remaining 13 systems are underway . whereas the period distribution of the hqs cvs is still somewhat preliminary , with 25% of the new cvs lacking a @xmath34 measurement , it is worth to note the following points .",
    "\\(1 ) only relatively few new cvs have been found below the gap , despite the fact that @xcite convincingly demonstrated that the applied selection criteria are most efficient for short - period cvs .",
    "this clearly implies that most of the short - period cvs in the parameter space covered by the hqs ( sky area , magnitude range , balmer line equivalent width ) _ have been previously identified _ , either because of their outbursts ( dwarf novae ) or their x - ray emission ( polars ) . in fact , _ most _ of the new dwarf novae discovered in the hqs have rather long outburst intervals , e.g. the suuma systems kvdra = hs1449 + 6415 @xcite , hs2219 + 1824 @xcite , or the deeply eclipsing @xmath35h dwarf nova gycnc = hs0907 + 1902 @xcite .",
    "the shortest - period cv from the hqs , hs2331 + 3905 , had no recorded outburst so far , resembling in many other aspects the ( in)famous wzsge @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) a very large number of cvs is found with orbital periods in the range @xmath13h ( aungwerojwit et al .",
    "this volume ; rodrguez - gil this volume ) , of which a large fraction are swsextantis stars .",
    "this includes four previously known systems ( pxand , bhlyn , wxari , and lxser ) , and 7 new discoveries , hs0357 + 0614=kuv03580 + 0614 @xcite , hs0455 + 8315 @xcite , hs0551 + 7241 @xcite , hs0728 + 6738 @xcite , hs0129 + 2933 , hs0220 + 0603 , and hs1813 + 6122 ( rodrguez - gil , this volume ) .",
    "the large number of new swsex stars found in the hqs ( 25% of the whole class ) is compatible with the properties of these objects : while they have relatively strong emission lines , they are weak x - ray emitters , and exhibit only moderate variability , making them inconspicuous for the two most widely used discovery mechanisms .",
    "whereas the pg survey already suggested that swsex stars may be fairly common , our follow - up work on hqs cvs clearly demonstrates that swsex stars are the dominant species of systems in the @xmath13h period range .",
    "the nature of the swsex stars is still intensively debated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a number of arguments indicate that these systems have mass transfer rates well in excess of those predicted by angular momentum loss through magnetic braking ( e.g. the very hot white dwarf primaries found in swsex stars , @xcite ) , and it has been proposed that they may contain weakly magnetic white dwarfs @xcite . investigating in detail the properties of _ all _",
    "cvs in the @xmath13h period range appears now to be a key project for our overall understanding of cv evolution .",
    "the hqs has turned out to be efficient in adding new members to the small class of ips , too , which also do not display large - amplitude variability .",
    "specifically , we have identified hs0618 + 7336=1rxs j062518.2 + 733433 as a rather `` normal '' ip ( @xmath36min , @xmath37min : @xcite ) , hs0756 + 1624=dwcnc as one of the few short - period ips , very similar to v1025cen ( @xmath38min , @xmath39min : @xcite ) , and an unusual long - period ip ( @xmath40min , @xmath41min : rodrguez - gil et al . in prep ) .    as with the other surveys mentioned so far ,",
    "also the hqs has unearthed a peculiar group of systems , the magnetic white dwarf / red dwarf binaries hs1023 + 3900 = wxlmi @xcite and hs0922 + 1333 @xcite .",
    "spectroscopically , these systems are characterised by a very cold white dwarf , a late - type stellar companion , and extremely strong and sharp cyclotron emission lines arising from an accretion shock close to the white dwarf surface .",
    "contrary to all other known polars , these systems have never been found in a state of high mass transfer , and were consequently named _ low accretion rate polars_. additional systems of this kind were identified in the sdss ( sect.[s - sdsscvs ] ) , and it may well be that these objects are not cvs , but _ pre - polars _ , with the white dwarf accreting from the wind of the donor star ( see schmidt this volume ; webbing this volume ) .",
    "finally , two extremely interesting objects have recently been discovered in the hqs .",
    "the detached white dwarf / red dwarf binary hs2237 + 8154 resembles ec134711258 discussed in sect.[s - eccvs ] in that its donor star is almost roche - lobe filling .",
    "in addition , it contains a very cold / old white dwarf , and its orbital period is 178min , just at the upper edge of the period gap .",
    "@xcite suggest three alternative evolutionary states for the system , being a pre - cv shortly before the start of mass transfer , a cv that has stopped mass transfer and is entering the period gap , or , in analogy to ec134711258 , a hibernating nova . hs2331 +",
    "3905 is probably the most complex cv found to date @xcite .",
    "it contains a cold white dwarf and most likely a brown dwarf donor , and shows all signs of an extremely low mass transfer rate .",
    "the system is eclipsing with a period of 81min , but also displays a photometric period of 83.4min which we interpret as a permanent superhump .",
    "hs2331 + 3905 is the brightest cv where a pulsating white dwarf , which is also very likely a rapid rotator , was found .",
    "most exotically , however , is the presence of a large - amplitude radial velocity variation in the emission line wings with a period of 3.5h , which is in no way commensurate with the orbital period , and which may be related to a precessing warped inner disc .",
    "the 2df quasar survey ( 2qz ) is a spectroscopic survey of colour - selected quasar candidates with @xmath42 using the aat/2df and covering @xmath43 .",
    "the candidates were selected by @xmath44 on ukst photographic plates , cutting out the main sequence @xcite .",
    "the total spectroscopic data base comprises some 48000 spectra .",
    "21 new cvs were identified so far , and @xcite reported first follow - up studies ( see fig.[f-2qzcvs ] ) .",
    "the 2qz cvs represent the faintest cv sample obtained so far .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is by far the largest of the surveys described in this paper .",
    "it is carried out using a purpose - built 2.5 m telescope in new mexico , and has been designed to obtain deep ( @xmath45 ) imaging in five broad - band filters and spectroscopy of @xmath46 colour - selected objects with a limiting magnitude of @xmath47 at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the sdss is to obtain an enormous photometric and spectroscopic data base of galaxies and quasars .",
    "qso candidates for the spectroscopy are selected by excluding main sequence stars , white dwarfs , and white dwarf / red dwarf binaries in the four - dimensional ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) colour space @xcite .",
    "for the discovery of cvs , this broad selection represents an enormous progress over the earlier  blue - only \" surveys , such as the pg survey ( sect.[s - pgcvs ] ) , and the sdss cvs will represent the most unbiased sample obtained so far . at the time of writing , the third data release ( dr3 ) has been made public , which provides imaging data for @xmath52 and spectroscopy for 528640 objects @xcite .",
    "sdss up to dr3 has resulted in the spectroscopic identification of 131 cvs , of which 113 are new discoveries ( @xcite , szkody priv .",
    "alas , by the time that the funding for sdss ends ( july 2005 ) , the covered survey area will substantially fall short of the planned @xmath53 . ] .",
    "the broad colour range covered by sdss is reflected in the very broad variety of subtypes among the sdss cvs .",
    "so far , period measurements are available only for @xmath54% of the new sdss cvs ( fig.[f - sdsscvs ] ) , and no firm conclusions should be drawn at this point , but it appears that the period distribution of the sdss cv sample differs dramatically from that of the presently known mixed bag of cvs ( fig.[f - allcvs ] )    it is strongly concentrated towards periods below the gap , and the gap itself is not very pronounced .",
    "this dominant number of short - period cvs is likely to prevail when more periods are determined , as the faint end of the sdss cv sample has not yet been explored , and these systems are most likely intrinsically faint low - mass transfer systems . a substantial number of the sdss cvs clearly exhibit the balmer lines of the white dwarf accretor , and fitting those spectra with model atmospheres suggests low effective temperatures around 11000k ( fig.[f - sdsscvwd ] ) , implying very low secular mean mass transfer rates @xcite .",
    "whereas in cvs white dwarf temperature determinations from optical data alone are prone to some uncertainties ( because of the contamination by the disc / hot spot ) , low white dwarf temperatures are independently suggested by the fact that several of the sdss cvs have been found to contain pulsating zzceti white dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "low mass transfer rates are also indicated by the absence of observed outbursts in most of the white dwarf dominated systems . combining all available evidence , it appears that sdss may be finding the missing population of old , low - luminosity short period cvsk @xcite , which is a clear bias in the target selection of the sdss spectroscopy . if the majority of cvs are post - period minimum systems , accretion heating may not be sufficient to keep their white dwarfs hot enough to be targeted by sdss .",
    "it is important to realise that while the sdss discovered low - luminosity cvs seem to match the predicted properties for old cvs near the minimum period , their _ number _ still falls significantly short with respect to the predicted space density : none of them is within @xmath55pc . ] .",
    "establishing the properties of the complete sdss cv sample is of outmost importance for testing and improving our understanding of cv evolution , but will require massive observational effort .",
    "a first step towards this goal has been the award of the international time 2004/5 on la palma for follow - up studies of sdss cvs ( pi gnsicke ) .",
    "a number of additional surveys have led to the discovery of cvs , and we can give here merely a brief and incomplete list . the first and second byurakan survey @xcite were objective prism surveys similar to the hqs ( sect.[s - hqscvs ] ) , resulting in the discovery of @xmath56 cvs and cv candidates .",
    "however , almost no detailed follow - up studies have been carried out with the exception of the ip dwcnc , independently discovered in the hqs @xcite .",
    "the caln - tololo survey has been another objective prism survey , carried out in the southern hemisphere , leading to the identification of 16 new cvs , with the first follow - up results just being published @xcite .",
    "finally , the hamburg - eso survey @xcite , a southern twin of the hqs , could potentially lead to the discovery of a substantial number of new southern declination cvs , but so far just a single new system has been reported bwscl = he23503950 @xcite .",
    "we thank neil parley and lindsey shaw greening , who compiled the data used in sect.[s - allcvs ] in an undergraduate project at the university of warwick ; all our hqs cv survey team members , and paula szkody for numerous discussions and communications on sdss cvs .",
    "this research has been supported by a pparc advanced fellowship ."
