    "the study of the size and shape of the density distributions of protons and neutrons in nuclei is a classic , yet always contemporary area of nuclear physics .",
    "the proton densities of a host of nuclei are known quite well from the accurate nuclear charge densities measured in experiments involving the electromagnetic interaction @xcite , like elastic electron scattering .",
    "in contrast , the neutron densities have been probed in fewer nuclei and are generally much less certain .",
    "the neutron distribution of @xmath1pb , and its rms radius in particular , is nowadays attracting significant interest in both experiment and theory .",
    "indeed , the neutron skin thickness , i.e. , the neutron - proton rms radius difference @xmath2 of this nucleus has close ties with the density - dependent nuclear symmetry energy and with the equation of state of neutron - rich matter . in nuclear models ,",
    "@xmath0 of @xmath1pb displays nearly linear correlations with the slope of the equation of state of neutron matter @xcite , with the density derivative @xmath3 of the symmetry energy @xcite , and with the surface - symmetry energy of the finite nucleus @xcite . at first sight",
    ", it may seem intriguing that a property of the mean position of the surface of the nucleon densities ( @xmath0 ) is correlated with a purely bulk property of infinite nuclear matter ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "however , we have to keep in mind that @xmath0 depends on the surface - symmetry energy .",
    "this quantity reduces the bulk - symmetry energy due to the finite size of the nucleus . assuming a local density approximation",
    ", we can correlate the surface - symmetry energy with the density slope @xmath3 , which determines the departure of the symmetry energy from the bulk value .",
    "the correlation of @xmath4 with @xmath3 then follows .",
    "actually , these correlations can be derived almost analytically starting from the droplet model ( dm ) of myers and wiatecki @xcite as we showed in refs .",
    "by reason of its close connections with the nuclear symmetry energy , knowing accurately @xmath0 of @xmath1pb can have important implications in diverse problems of nuclear structure and of heavy - ion reactions , in studies of atomic parity violation , as well as in the description of neutron stars and in other areas of nuclear astrophysics ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) . since the charge radius of @xmath1pb has been measured with extreme accuracy ( @xmath5 fm @xcite ) , the neutron rms radius of @xmath1pb is the principal unknown piece of the puzzle .",
    "the lead parity radius experiment ( prex ) @xcite is a challenging experimental effort that aims to determine @xmath6 of @xmath1pb almost model independently and to 1% accuracy by parity - violating electron scattering @xcite .",
    "this purely electroweak experiment has been run at the jefferson lab very recently , although results are not yet available .",
    "the parity - violating electron scattering is useful to measure neutron densities because in the low - momentum transfer regime the @xmath7 boson couples mainly to neutrons . for protons , this coupling",
    "is highly suppressed because of the value of the weinberg angle .",
    "therefore , from parity - violating electron scattering one can obtain the weak charge form factor and the closely related neutron form factor . from these data ,",
    "the neutron rms radius can in principle be deduced @xcite .",
    "this way of proceeding is similar to how the charge density is obtained from unpolarized electron scattering data @xcite .",
    "the electroweak experiments get rid of the complexities of the hadronic interactions and the reaction mechanism does not have to be modeled .",
    "thus , the analysis of the data can be both clean and model independent . there may be a certain model dependence , in the end , in having to use some neutron density shape to extract the neutron rms radius from the parity - violating asymmetry measured at a finite momentum transfer .",
    "to date , the existing constraints on neutron radii , skins , and neutron distributions of nuclei have mostly used strongly interacting hadronic probes .",
    "unfortunately , the measurements of neutron distributions with hadronic probes are bound to have some model dependence because of the uncertainties associated with the strong force . among the more frequent experimental techniques we may quote nucleon elastic scattering @xcite , the inelastic excitation of the giant dipole and spin - dipole resonances @xcite , and experiments in exotic atoms @xcite .",
    "recent studies indicate that the pygmy dipole resonance may be another helpful tool to constrain neutron skins @xcite .",
    "the extraction of neutron radii and neutron skins from the experiment is intertwined with the dependence of these quantities on the shape of the neutron distribution @xcite .",
    "the data typically do not indicate unambiguosly , by themselves , if the difference between the peripheral neutron and proton densities that gives rise to the neutron skin is caused by an extended bulk radius of the neutron density , by a modification of the width of the surface , or by some combination of both effects . in the present work we look for theoretical indications on this problem and",
    "study whether the origin of the neutron skin thickness of @xmath1pb comes from the bulk or from the surface of the nucleon densities according to the mean - field models of nuclear structure .",
    "the answer turns out to be connected with the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy in the theory .",
    "we described in ref .",
    "@xcite a procedure to discern bulk and surface contributions in the neutron skin thickness of nuclei .",
    "it can be applied to both theoretical and experimental nucleon densities as it only requires to know the equivalent sharp radius and surface width of these densities , which one can obtain by fitting the actual densities with two - parameter fermi ( 2pf ) distributions .",
    "the 2pf shape is commonly used to characterize nuclear densities and nuclear potentials in both theoretical and experimental analyses .",
    "the doubly magic number of protons and neutrons in @xmath1pb ensures that deformations do not influence the results and spherical density distributions describe the nuclear surface very well .",
    "we perform our calculations with several representative effective nuclear forces , namely , nonrelativistic interactions of the skyrme and gogny type and relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) interactions .",
    "the free parameters and coupling constants of these nuclear interactions have usually been adjusted to describe data that are well known empirically such as binding energies , charge radii , single - particle properties , and several features of the nuclear equation of state .",
    "however , the same interactions predict widely different results for the size of neutron skin of @xmath1pb and , as we will see , for its bulk or surface nature .",
    "we also study the halo or skin character @xcite of the nucleon densities of @xmath1pb in mean - field models .",
    "finally , we perform calculations of parity - violating electron scattering on @xmath1pb .",
    "we show that if 2pf nucleon densities are assumed , the parity - violating asymmetry as predicted by mean - field models can be approximated by a simple and analytical expression in terms of the central radius and surface width of the neutron and proton density profiles .",
    "this suggests that an experiment such as prex could allow to obtain some information about the neutron density profile of the @xmath1pb nucleus in addition to its neutron rms radius .",
    "the rest of the article proceeds as follows . in sec .",

    "[ summary ] .",
    "the analysis of bulk and surface contributions to the neutron skin thickness of a nucleus requires proper definitions of these quantities based on nuclear density distributions .",
    "we presented in ref.@xcite such a study , and we summarize only its basic points here .",
    "one can characterize the size of a nuclear density distribution @xmath8 through several definitions of radii , and each definition may be more useful for a specific purpose ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a thorough review ) . among the most common radii",
    ", we have the _ central radius _",
    "@xmath9 : @xmath10 the _ equivalent sharp radius _",
    "@xmath11 : @xmath12 i.e. , the radius of a uniform sharp distribution whose density equals the bulk value of the actual density and has the same number of particles ; and the _ equivalent rms radius _",
    "@xmath13 : @xmath14 which describes a uniform sharp distribution with the same rms radius as the given density .",
    "these three radii are related by expansion formulas @xcite : @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is the _ surface width _ of the density profile : @xmath17 which provides a measure of the extent of the surface of the density",
    ". relations ( [ qr ] ) usually converge quickly because @xmath18 is small in nuclei , especially in heavy - mass systems .",
    "nuclear density distributions have oscillations in the inner bulk region and a meaningful average is needed to determine the density values @xmath19 and @xmath20 appearing in the above equations .",
    "this can be achieved by matching the original density with a 2pf distribution : @xmath21 } } .\\ ] ] in 2pf functions the bulk density value corresponds very closely to the central density , and the latter coincides to high accuracy with the @xmath22 parameter if @xmath23 is negligible .",
    "the surface width @xmath16 and the diffuseness parameter @xmath24 of a 2pf function are related by @xmath25 .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the equivalent sharp radius @xmath11 is the quantity of basic geometric importance of the @xmath9 , @xmath13 , and @xmath11 radii .",
    "this is because a sharp distribution of radius @xmath11 has the same volume integral as the density of the finite nucleus and differs from it only in the surface region .",
    "we illustrate this fact in fig .",
    "[ radii ] using as example the neutron density of @xmath1pb of a mean - field calculation .",
    "we can see that the mean - field density is clearly overestimated in the whole nuclear interior by a sharp sphere of radius @xmath9 .",
    "the equivalent rms radius @xmath13 fails also , by underestimating it .",
    "only the equivalent sharp radius @xmath11 is able to reproduce properly the bulk part of the original density profile of the nucleus .",
    "therefore , @xmath11 appears as the suitable radius to describe the size of the bulk of the nucleus .",
    "( color online ) comparison of sharp density profiles having radii @xmath9 , @xmath11 , and @xmath13 with the mean - field and 2pf density distributions for the neutron density of @xmath1pb .",
    "the rmf interaction nl3 has been used in the mean - field calculation . ]    as the neutron skin thickness ( [ skin ] ) is defined through rms radii , it can be expressed with @xmath13 : @xmath26 recalling from ( [ qr ] ) that @xmath27 , we have a natural distinction in @xmath0 between bulk ( @xmath28 ) and surface contributions .",
    "that is to say , @xmath29 with @xmath30 independent of surface properties , and @xmath31 of surface origin",
    ". the nucleus may develop a neutron skin by separation of the bulk radii @xmath11 of neutrons and protons or by modification of the width @xmath16 of the surfaces of the neutron and proton densities . in the general case ,",
    "both effects are expected to contribute .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ rs ] ) coincides with the expression of the surface width contribution to the neutron skin thickness provided by the dm of myers and wiatecki @xcite if we set in eq .",
    "( [ rs ] ) @xmath32 .",
    "the next - order correction to eq .",
    "( [ rs ] ) can be easily evaluated for 2pf distributions ( cf .  ref .",
    "@xcite for the higher - order corrections to the expansions ( [ qr ] ) ) and gives @xmath33 this quantity is usually very small  indeed , we neglected it in @xcite . in the case of @xmath1pb ,",
    "we have found in all calculations with mean - field models that it is between @xmath34 fm and @xmath35 fm , and thus can be obviated for most purposes .",
    "but because in the present work we deal with some detailed comparisons among the models , we have included ( [ rscorr ] ) in the numerical values shown for the surface contribution @xmath36 in the later sections .",
    "it is to be mentioned that there is no universal method to do the parametrization of the neutron and proton densities with 2pf functions .",
    "a popular prescription is to use a @xmath37 minimization of the differences between the density to be reproduced and the 2pf profile , or of the differences between their logarithms .",
    "these methods may somewhat depend on conditions given during minimization ( number of mesh points , limits , etc . ) . as in @xcite , we have preferred to extract the parameters of the 2pf profiles by imposing that they reproduce the same quadratic @xmath38 and quartic @xmath39 moments of the self - consistent mean - field densities , and the same number of nucleons .",
    "these conditions allow us to determine in a unique way the equivalent 2pf densities and pay attention to a good reproduction of the surface region of the original density because the local distributions of the quantities @xmath40 and @xmath41 are peaked at the peripheral region of the nucleus .",
    "an example of this type of fit is displayed in fig .",
    "[ radii ] by the dash - dotted line .",
    "it can be seen that the equivalent 2pf distribution nicely averages the quantal oscillations at the interior and reproduces accurately the behavior of the mean - field density at the surface .",
    "we calculate our results with nonrelativistic models of skyrme type ( sgii , ska , skm * , sk - t4 , sk - t6 , sk - rs , skmp , sksm * , msk7 , sly4 , hfb-8 , hfb-17 ) and of gogny type ( d1s , d1n ) , as well as with several relativistic models ( nl1 , nl - z , nl - sh nl - ra1 , nl3 , tm1 , nlc , g2 , fsugold , dd - me2 , nl3 * ) .",
    "the original references to the different interactions can be found in the papers @xcite for the skyrme models , @xcite for the gogny models , and @xcite and ref .  [ 19 ] in @xcite for the rmf models .",
    "it may be mentioned that the recent force hfb-17 @xcite achieves the lowest rms deviation with respect to experimental nuclear masses found to date in a mean - field approach .",
    "as is well known , nonrelativistic and relativistic models differ in the stiffness of the symmetry energy .",
    "note that by soft or stiff symmetry energy we mean that the symmetry energy increases slowly or rapidly as a function of the nuclear density around the saturation point .",
    "of course , the soft or stiff character can depend on the explored density region ; for example , it is possible that a symmetry energy that is soft at nuclear densities becomes stiff at much higher densities @xcite , or that a model with a stiff symmetry energy at normal density has a smaller symmetry energy at low densities @xcite .",
    "the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath42 around saturation is frequently parametrized through the slope @xmath3 of @xmath42 at the saturation density : @xmath43 the pressure of pure neutron matter is directly proportional to @xmath3 @xcite and thus the @xmath3 value has important implications for both neutron - rich nuclei and neutron stars .",
    "the symmetry energy of the skyrme and gogny forces analyzed in this work displays , as usual in the nonrelativistic models , from the very soft to the moderately stiff density dependence at nuclear densities ( see table  [ table1 ] for the @xmath3 parameter of the models ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the majority of the relativistic parameter sets have a stiff or very stiff symmetry energy around saturation .",
    "the exception to the last statement in our case are the covariant parameter sets fsugold and dd - me2 that have a milder symmetry energy than the typical rmf models .",
    "fsugold achieves this through an isoscalar - isovector nonlinear meson coupling @xcite and dd - me2 because of having density - dependent meson - exchange couplings @xcite .    in table",
    "[ table1 ] we display the neutron skin thickness of @xmath1pb obtained from the self - consistent densities of the various interactions ( denoted as @xmath44 ) .",
    "it is evident that the nuclear mean - field models predict a large window of values for this quantity .",
    "the nonrelativistic models with softer symmetry energies point toward a range of about 0.10.17 fm .",
    "most of the relativistic models , having a stiff symmetry energy , point toward larger neutron skins of 0.250.3  fm . in between , the relativistic models dd - me2 and fsugold predict a result close to 0.2  fm and the skyrme interactions that have relatively stiffer symmetry energies fill in the range between 0.2 and 0.25  fm .",
    ".neutron skin thickness in @xmath1pb calculated with the self - consistent densities of several nuclear mean - field models ( @xmath44 ) and its partition into bulk and surface contributions defined in sec .  [ formalism ] , as well as the relative weight of these bulk and surface parts .",
    "the models have been set out according to increasing @xmath44 .",
    "the density slope @xmath3 of the symmetry energy of the models is also listed . in order to help distinguish relativistic and nonrelativistic models",
    ", we have preceded the relativistic ones with an r in this table . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table3 ]    if we inspect the results for the surface diffuseness of the density profiles of @xmath1pb in table  [ table3 ] , we see that @xmath45 of neutrons lies in a window of 0.530.59 fm ( with the majority of the models having @xmath45 between 0.545 and 0.565 fm ) .",
    "the nonrelativistic interactions favor @xmath46 fm , whereas the rmf sets favor @xmath47 fm .",
    "this indicates that the fall - off of the neutron density of @xmath1pb at the surface is in general faster in the interactions with a soft symmetry energy than in the interactions with a stiff symmetry energy .",
    "the surface diffuseness @xmath48 of the proton density spans _ in either _ the nonrelativistic or the relativistic models almost the same window of values ( 0.430.47 fm ; with the majority of the models having @xmath48 between 0.445 and 0.465 fm ) .",
    "this fact is in contrast to the other 2pf parameters discussed so far .",
    "actually , the @xmath48 value of the proton density can be definitely larger in some nonrelativistic forces than in some relativistic forces ( for example , in the case of skm * and nl3 ) .",
    "one finds that the total spread of @xmath45 and @xmath48 within the analyzed models is quite similar : about 0.05 fm in both @xmath45 and @xmath48 .",
    "this spread corresponds roughly to a 10% variation compared to the mean values of @xmath45 and @xmath48 .",
    "it is remarkable that while among the models @xmath49 has a significantly larger spread than @xmath50 , the surface diffuseness @xmath45 of the neutron density has essentially the same small spread as the surface diffuseness @xmath48 of the proton density .",
    "as we have discussed at the end of sec .",
    "[ bulksurf ] , this is likely imposed by the nuclear mass fits .",
    "it means that our ignorance about the neutron distribution in @xmath1pb does not seem to produce in the mean - field models a larger uncertainty for @xmath45 of neutrons than for @xmath48 of protons , and that most of the uncertainty goes to the value of @xmath49 .",
    "the difference @xmath51 of the central radii of the nucleon densities of @xmath1pb turns out to range approximately between 0 .  and 0.2 fm .",
    "it is smaller for soft symmetry energies and larger for stiff symmetry energies .",
    "we realize that the limiting situation of a halo - type distribution where the nucleon densities of @xmath1pb have @xmath52 and @xmath53 is actually attained in the nuclear mean - field models with a very soft symmetry energy ( like in hfb-8 or msk7 where @xmath51 even is slightly negative ) .",
    "the difference @xmath54 of the neutron and proton surface diffuseness in @xmath1pb is comprised between nearly 0.08 and 0.1 fm in the nonrelativistic forces and between nearly 0.1 and 0.12 fm in the rmf forces .",
    "this implies that no interaction predicts @xmath54 of @xmath1pb as close to vanishing as @xmath51 is in some forces .",
    "thus , the limiting situation where the nucleon densities in @xmath1pb would have @xmath55 and @xmath56 is not found in the nuclear mean - field models .",
    "indeed , we observe in table  [ table3 ] that if @xmath51 becomes larger in the models , also @xmath54 tends overall to become larger . in order to help visualize graphically the change in the mean - field nucleon densities of @xmath1pb from having a nearly vanishing @xmath51 or a large @xmath51 , we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ profiles ] the example of the densities of the msk7 and nl3 interactions . on the one hand",
    ", we see that both models msk7 and nl3 predict basically the same proton density , as expected . on the other hand",
    ", the difference between having @xmath57 in msk7 and @xmath56 in nl3 can be appreciated in the higher bulk and the faster fall - off at the surface of the neutron density of msk7 compared with nl3 .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that in @xmath1pb the nuclear mean - field models favor the halo - type distribution with @xmath58 and @xmath59 if they have a very soft ( `` supersoft '' ) symmetry energy , they favor a mixed - type distribution if they have mild symmetry energies , and a situation where @xmath49 is clearly larger than @xmath50 if the symmetry energy is stiff , but that the pure skin - type distribution where @xmath60 in @xmath1pb is not supported ( not even @xmath61 ) by the mean - field models .",
    "although the experimental evidence available to date on the neutron skin thickness of @xmath1pb is compatible with the ranges of the @xmath51 and @xmath54 parameters considered in our study , it is not to be excluded that the description of a precision measurement in @xmath1pb may need of nucleon densities with @xmath51 or @xmath54 values not fitting table  [ table3 ] .",
    "however , a sizable deviation ( such as @xmath60 ) could mean that there is some missing physics in the isospin channel of present mean - field interactions , because once these interactions are calibrated to reproduce the observed binding energies and charge radii of nuclei they typically lead to the ranges of table  [ table3 ] .",

    "<S> we study whether the neutron skin thickness @xmath0 of @xmath1pb originates from the bulk or from the surface of the nucleon density distributions , according to the mean - field models of nuclear structure , and find that it depends on the stiffness of the nuclear symmetry energy . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk contribution to @xmath0 arises from an extended sharp radius of neutrons , whereas the surface contribution arises from different widths of the neutron and proton surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> nuclear models where the symmetry energy is stiff , as typical relativistic models , predict a bulk contribution in @xmath0 of @xmath1pb about twice as large as the surface contribution . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , models with a soft symmetry energy like common nonrelativistic models predict that @xmath0 of @xmath1pb is divided similarly into bulk and surface parts . indeed , if the symmetry energy is supersoft , the surface contribution becomes dominant . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the linear correlation of @xmath0 of @xmath1pb with the density derivative of the nuclear symmetry energy arises from the bulk part of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that most models predict a mixed - type ( between halo and skin ) neutron distribution for @xmath1pb . although the halo - type limit is actually found in the models with a supersoft symmetry energy , the skin - type limit is not supported by any mean - field model . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compute parity - violating electron scattering in the conditions of the @xmath1pb parity radius experiment ( prex ) and obtain a pocket formula for the parity - violating asymmetry in terms of the parameters that characterize the shape of the @xmath1pb nucleon densities . </S>"
