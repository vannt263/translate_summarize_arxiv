    "the casimir force is known to depend on the electromagnetic properties of the relevant objects ( ` mirrors ' ) and on their geometric configuration , in a rather involved way  @xcite .    to put the problem we shall deal with in context ,",
    "let us consider the casimir force for a quite general situation , namely , we assume that the geometry of the problem may be characterized by just two surfaces .",
    "those surfaces may correspond , for example , to the boundaries of two mirrors .",
    "alternatively , the surfaces themselves may describe zero - width ( ` thin ' ) mirrors . yet another possibility is that those surfaces may be the interfaces between media with different electromagnetic properties , occupying different spatial regions .",
    "in a situation like the ones above , one can think of the casimir energy as a _ functional _ of the functions determining the surfaces .",
    "of course , it is generally quite difficult to compute that functional for arbitrary surfaces ; exact results are available only for highly symmetric configurations , the simplest of which is perhaps the case of two flat , infinite , parallel plates .",
    "however , when the surfaces are gently curved , almost parallel , and close to each other , the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) is expected to be a very accurate method to calculate the casimir energy",
    ". introduced by derjaguin many years ago  @xcite to compute van der waals forces , this approximation consists of replacing both surfaces by a set of parallel plates .",
    "then one calculates the energy as the sum of the casimir energies due to each pair of plates ( each plate paired with the nearest one in the other mirror ) .",
    "the pfa has also been used successfully applied in other contexts , like nuclear physics  @xcite and electrostatics  @xcite .    in spite of the simplicity and long standing usefulness of the pfa , its validity had not been possible to asses until quite recently , mostly because there was no systematic way of improving the approximation . indeed ,",
    "even the next to leading order ( ntlo ) correction was unknown .",
    "in a recent work  @xcite , we have shown that the pfa can be thought of as an expansion of the casimir energy in derivatives of the functions that describe the shapes of the surfaces . the leading order in this expansion , that contains no derivatives ,",
    "does reproduce the pfa , while the higher order terms contain the corrections . in ref .",
    "@xcite we considered the case of a flat surface in front of a gently curved one , the latter described by a function @xmath0 . for simplicity , we computed the vacuum energy for a massless quantum scalar field satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions , the result being : @xmath1\\ , , \\label{de}\\ ] ] with @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the first term in this expression is the pfa , while the second term is the ntlo correction .",
    "this result has been generalized by bimonte et al to the case of two curved , perfectly conducting surfaces , for scalar fields satisfying dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions , and also to the electromagnetic case  @xcite .",
    "the results for the latter are , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    as a validity check",
    ", it has been shown that , whenever analytic results are available for particular geometries , the corresponding derivative expansion correctly reproduces both the pfa and its ntlo correction  @xcite .",
    "moreover , initial discrepancies  @xcite between the improved pfa and the analytic calculations for the particular case of a cylinder in front of a plane  @xcite , has been resolved in favor of the improved pfa after a revision of the rather involved analytic calculation for this particular geometry  @xcite .",
    "bimonte et al also considered the case in which the surfaces are interfaces between different media , with frequency - dependent permittivity  @xcite . in this case , the numerical coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath7 become rather complicated functions of @xmath8 and of the dimensional constants that describe the electromagnetic properties of the media .    in this paper , we will extend the improved proximity force approximation to the case of two imperfect thin mirrors .",
    "this kind of configuration have already been considered in several previous works ; for instance , in order to describe the interactions of plasma sheets , graphene sheets or , more generally , arbitrary semi - transparent mirrors , both for the static and dynamical casimir effects  @xcite .    in some derivations of the casimir energy for perfect and imperfect mirrors ,",
    "the boundary conditions at the interfaces are represented in terms of auxiliary scalar fields coupled to the te and tm modes of the electromagnetic field  @xcite .",
    "we will follow here a similar approach , but developing a new formalism , based on vector auxiliary fields that couple to the dual of the maxwell tensor @xmath9 evaluated on the surfaces . in this formalism gauge invariance",
    "is more apparent at the different stages of the calculation .",
    "moreover , the formalism could be useful to address problems with more complex geometries , where it could not be possible to describe the electromagnetic field in terms of independent te and tm modes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the model and introduce the necessary definitions and conventions . in section 3",
    "we derive the formal expression of the vacuum energy for the electromagnetic field , using the above mentioned formalism based on a vector auxiliary field .",
    "the derivative expansion for the electromagnetic vacuum energy is presented in section 4 .",
    "we discuss the results in section 5 , where we analyze the two limiting cases of perfectly conducting and near transparent mirrors .",
    "in the latter , we find that the ntlo correction to the pfa is tantamount to use the area of the curved surface in the leading order expression .",
    "we also discuss in that section a particular class of imperfect mirrors , in which the transmission and reflection coefficients do not involve dimensionful constants . for these ` graphene - like ' mirrors , dimensional",
    "analysis implies that the vacuum energy is of the form given in eq.([de ] ) , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are constants and depend on the dimensionless quantities that describe the mirrors .",
    "we present some numerical evaluations of these coefficients that interpolate between almost transparent and perfectly conducting mirrors .",
    "section 6 contains the conclusions of this work .",
    "we shall consider a model in which the role of the fluctuating vacuum field is played by an abelian gauge field , @xmath10 , in @xmath11 dimensions , coupled to two imperfect mirrors , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "these are presumed to have negligible widths , so that we shall use an idealized description whereby they are treated as mathematical surfaces .",
    "we will , moreover , assume that one of the surfaces ( @xmath12 ) is a plane , while the other ( @xmath13 ) , which may be curved , can always be described by a monge patch . summarizing , the two surfaces correspond to : @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the spatial coordinates . throughout this work we shall use euclidean conventions , with @xmath16 , @xmath17 being the imaginary time .",
    "however , we have found it simpler to keep our treatment quite general regarding the actual form of the surfaces , postponing the use of ( [ eq : deflr ] ) to the point when we actually need those particular expressions .    the action @xmath18 for this model will have the following structure : @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the electromagnetic field and @xmath21 its free action . @xmath22 and",
    "@xmath23 are terms that couple @xmath20 to each mirror , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 denoting parametrizations of their respective surfaces . @xmath22 and",
    "@xmath26 can be different because of two reasons : first , they correspond to different surfaces , and second , they may also have to account for different electromagnetic ( response ) properties , for example , when the mirrors are composed of different materials .",
    "we shall then consider a rather general term , @xmath27 , corresponding to the coupling to an arbitrary surface @xmath28 , particularizing to the @xmath12 and @xmath13 cases afterwards .",
    "thus , we assume the static surface @xmath28 to be defined in parametric form : @xmath29 although the surface is static , to write the ( @xmath30-dimensional ) term @xmath27 it is , however , convenient , to introduce a parametrization for the world - volume @xmath31 swept by the surface @xmath28 , since that is the spacetime region @xmath31 where the interaction takes place : @xmath32 where @xmath33 , and @xmath34 as in ( [ eq : defsigma ] ) .",
    "the world - volume is three - dimensional , and we adopt the convention of using indices from the beginning of the greek alphabet to denote components in that space ; for example , in an expression like @xmath35 we implicitly assume that @xmath36 runs from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "we do need to introduce more objects in that space , like the induced metric , @xmath39 , which may be written in terms of the parametrization : @xmath40 we also need to introduce @xmath41 , a local basis of tangent vectors to @xmath31 , such that .",
    "they are , by construction , normalized to satisfy the condition .    before writing the explicit expression for the action , and to make contact with previous works ,",
    "let us describe a simpler model with a vacuum scalar field .",
    "the free action is @xmath42 assuming that the surface action @xmath27 is quadratic in @xmath43 , its general form is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the determinant of the induced metric and @xmath46 describes the ( nonlocal ) response of the mirror .",
    "the local approximation of this action is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a constant ( the subindex @xmath49 stands for scalar ) .",
    "eq.([deltapot ] ) describes the so called ` @xmath50-potentials ' , widely used as toy models to describe imperfect mirrors .",
    "one can check that this kind of potentials induce a discontinuity in the normal derivative of the scalar field across the surface , i.e. @xmath51 = \\lambda_s\\varphi$ ] .",
    "the factor @xmath52 is crucial to produce such boundary condition @xcite . in the limit @xmath53",
    ", the field must vanish on the surface in order to have a finite discontinuity across the surface , and therefore one recovers the usual dirichlet boundary condition on @xmath28 .    in the electromagnetic case",
    ", the explicit form of @xmath54 will be @xmath55 \\;,\\ ] ] where the term proportional to @xmath56 provides the gauge - fixing . in the calculations presented in the next sections",
    ", we shall adopt the feynman ( @xmath57 ) gauge .    assuming that @xmath27 is quadratic in @xmath10",
    ", gauge invariance implies that it will have the general form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a polarization tensor that depends on the microscopic degrees of freedom on the mirror , and @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the covariant derivative operator , corresponding to the connection for the induced metric , acting ( in this case ) on a covariant vector .",
    "we have used @xmath62 as a shorthand for the components of the gauge field @xmath63 on @xmath64 , projected along the directions defined by the local basis : @xmath65 \\ ,      e^\\mu_\\alpha(\\sigma ) \\;.\\ ] ]    as in the scalar case , we will start our discussion with a local interaction @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a constant , and afterwards we shall extend the results to include frequency - dependent couplings . note that the constants @xmath67 and @xmath48 have different dimensions .",
    "as it should be evident from the actual form of the interaction term that we are assuming for the model , this kind of mirror involves only on the gauge field components which are _ parallel _ to the world - volume .",
    "however , a term like this induces discontinuities across the surface of the component of the electric field which is normal to @xmath28 , and of the components of the magnetic field which are parallel to that surface .",
    "the discontinuity is proportional to @xmath67 and depends on parallel components of the gauge field , producing the boundary conditions of a perfect conductor in the limit @xmath68 , as in the scalar case .",
    "for instance , for the flat surface at @xmath69 the boundary conditions read @xmath70 where the sum over @xmath71 excludes @xmath72 .",
    "these boundary conditions can be explicitly written in terms of the field components as @xmath73 where , for simplicity , we assumed that the fields do not depend on the coordinate @xmath74 .",
    "note that in eq.([eq : defssigma ] ) we are assuming a lorentz - invariant interaction , which would be produced by relativistic degrees of freedom on the mirror .",
    "one could of course consider the interaction between the gauge fields and non - relativistic matter on the mirror , giving different boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "for example , the boundary conditions obtained in the case of a fluid of nonrelativistic electrons @xcite coincide with ours for the normal component of the electric field , but differ for the parallel components of the magnetic field .",
    "accordingly , the reflection and transmission coefficients in both models will be different .",
    "finally , one should check that a term like ( [ eq : defssigma ] ) does preserve gauge invariance .",
    "this is indeed the case that can be seen from the fact that under the transformation : , which is a @xmath75 gauge transformation in @xmath11 dimensions , one has , with : @xmath76 \\ , e^\\mu_\\alpha(\\sigma )   = \\partial_\\mu\\omega[y(\\sigma ) ]   \\partial_\\alpha y^\\mu(\\sigma )   = \\partial_\\alpha \\omega(\\sigma)\\ ] ] where @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "thus @xmath78 is invariant , since @xmath79 .",
    "in the functional approach to the casimir effect , to obtain the vacuum energy , one usually starts from @xmath80 , the vacuum transition amplitude , or , equivalently , the zero temperature limit of a finite - temperature partition function .",
    "for the vacuum field @xmath10 , in the presence of the two mirrors , the case at hand , @xmath80 may be written as follows : @xmath81\\;.\\ ] ] to proceed , one should integrate the electromagnetic field . to that end , it is convenient to perform first a transformation of the interaction terms , so that @xmath10 only appears linearly , rather than quadratically .",
    "this may be done at the expense of introducing auxiliary fields , a procedure that we implement now . to simplify the procedure ,",
    "we first represent @xmath9 in terms of its dual @xmath82 , a pseudo - vector , such that : @xmath83 where we adopted the convention that @xmath84 , as well as @xmath85 , denote the levi - civita permutation symbol ( i.e. , without including any power of @xmath86 as a factor ) .",
    "the generic term @xmath87 may be written as @xmath88 then we introduce a pseudo - vector auxiliary field @xmath89 , so that the exponential of the interaction term above may be obtained as the result of a gaussian integral : @xmath90 \\;=\\ ; \\frac{1}{\\mathcal n_\\xi}\\int { \\mathcal d } \\xi \\ ;   \\exp \\big [ - { \\mathcal s}_q(\\xi;\\lambda ) + i \\int d^3\\sigma \\sqrt{g(\\sigma ) } \\xi_\\alpha(\\sigma ) \\widetilde{f}^\\alpha(\\sigma ) \\big ] \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath91 and @xmath92    note that the representation above is not unique , in the following sense : defining the longitudinal ( @xmath93 ) and transverse ( @xmath94 ) components of @xmath95 : @xmath96 we see that @xmath97 does not couple to @xmath98 . indeed ,",
    "because of ( [ eq : dual ] ) , we see that : @xmath99 where we have used bianchi s identity : .",
    "it is , therefore , possible to modify the auxiliary field action , for example by adding a term depending only on @xmath97 to the @xmath100 term , such that : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a function of @xmath103 ( and not of @xmath104 ) whose precise form will be determined in order to simplify the calculations .",
    "thus , a more general ( but equally valid ) way to rewrite the interaction term is @xmath105 = \\frac{1}{\\mathcal n'_\\xi } \\ , \\int { \\mathcal d } \\xi \\ ; \\exp \\big[- { \\mathcal s'}_q(\\xi;\\lambda ) + i \\int d^3\\sigma \\sqrt{g(\\sigma ) } \\ , \\xi_\\alpha(\\sigma ) \\widetilde{f}^\\alpha(\\sigma ) \\big ] \\;,\\ ] ] @xmath106    besides , note that the term which couples linearly the gauge field to the auxiliary field , can be reinterpreted as an interaction with a surface - dependent ` current ' @xmath107 : @xmath108 where @xmath109 \\ ,",
    "e^\\mu_\\alpha(\\sigma ) \\ , \\epsilon^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}\\partial_\\beta \\xi_\\gamma(\\sigma ) \\;,\\ ] ] is a ` topologically conserved ' current , namely , it satisfies , by its very form , regardless of dynamics .",
    "the process introduced above for @xmath28 may be then independently applied to the two interaction terms , @xmath22 and @xmath26 , which are defined as follows : @xmath110 since we introduce one auxiliary field for each interaction term in the action , the gauge field will be coupled linearly to the sum of two currents . indeed , the use of two auxiliary fields , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , in the partition function , yields : @xmath113 @xmath114 where @xmath115 , with @xmath116 and @xmath117 obtained from ( [ eq : jsigma ] ) , replacing @xmath28 by @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .    integrating out @xmath10 in ( [ eq : zetal ] ) , yields : @xmath118 \\big\\ } \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath119 is the ( free ) @xmath20-field propagator , which in the feynman gauge becomes : @xmath120 here",
    "@xmath121 is the euclidean free scalar field propagator in @xmath11 dimensions : @xmath122 where we have used a ` bra - ket ' notation to denote matrix elements of functional operators .",
    "note that @xmath123 can not contribute to the casimir energy , since it is independent of the coupling to the mirrors . on the other hand ,",
    "the normalization factors @xmath124 @xmath125 do not contribute either , albeit for a different reason : each one of them depends only on the properties of one the mirrors , being adamant to the coupling of the other .",
    "thus , we define the vacuum energy , @xmath126 , in such a way that those contributions , irrelevant to the casimir interaction energy , are subtracted from the very beginning : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the extent of the imaginary time interval .",
    "we then proceed to the evaluation of @xmath129 , defined in ( [ eq : defgamma ] ) .",
    "we note that there still remain in this object contributions that correspond to mirrors self - interactions , depending on only one of the mirrors .",
    "they will be neglected , since our objective is to calculate the casimir interaction energy between two mirrors , a physical magnitude to which self - interaction energies can not contribute .",
    "we deal now with the functional integral expression for @xmath129 , which in view of the above has the following structure : @xmath130 where @xmath131 which is a quadratic form in the auxiliary fields . in order to perform the integral over the auxiliary fields , we need an explicit form for the different terms in @xmath132 .    taking into account ( [ eq : deflr ] )",
    ", we can find the metric tensors and local tangent vector for each mirror ; all of these are elements that enter in the terms above . in both cases ,",
    "the parameters @xmath133 are chosen as @xmath134 , with @xmath135 .",
    "we also refer to @xmath136 as @xmath137 , reserving the notation @xmath138 for @xmath139 .    for the @xmath12 surface ,",
    "the parametrization is then : @xmath140 thus , for @xmath12 we simply have , @xmath141 for @xmath142 , while @xmath143 . for @xmath13 , on the other hand : @xmath144 therefore , @xmath145 which implies : @xmath146 .",

    "besides , we have written the integration variables as a subindex of the integral .    for the analogous term that involves the @xmath117 current instead of @xmath116 ,",
    "the corresponding expression is : @xmath152 @xmath153 \\nonumber\\\\ + \\epsilon^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma } \\epsilon^{{\\alpha'}{\\beta'}{\\gamma ' } }",
    "\\partial_\\beta\\psi(x_\\parallel ) \\ , \\partial'_{\\beta ' } \\psi({x'}_\\parallel )   \\big[\\partial_\\gamma \\partial'_{\\gamma ' }   d(x_\\parallel , \\psi({\\mathbf x}_\\parallel ) ;   x'_\\parallel,\\psi({\\mathbf x}'_\\parallel))\\big ] \\big\\ } \\xi^r_{\\alpha'}(x'_\\parallel ) \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , @xmath154 @xmath155 and @xmath156 @xmath157 defining the matrix kernel @xmath158 , such that @xmath159 where @xmath160 , the vacuum energy @xmath126 may be written as follows : @xmath161 \\;\\ ] ] where the trace affects both continuum and discrete indices .",
    "as already stressed , the vacuum energy depends nontrivially on the shape of the @xmath13 surface , i.e. it can be thought as a nonlocal functional of @xmath8 .",
    "when the r surface is gently curved , almost parallel and close to the @xmath12-plane , we expect this functional to be well approximated by a derivative expansion : @xmath162\\ , \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\ , e_{\\rm vac}^{(0 ) } + e_{\\rm vac}^{(2 ) } + ... \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to evaluate the functions @xmath163 and @xmath164 , it is enough to consider a class of surfaces of the form @xmath165 with @xmath166 . indeed , for these surfaces , and up to quadratic order in @xmath167 , the vacuum energy will be of the form @xmath168\\ , , \\label{withlinear}\\ ] ] and therefore one can obtain @xmath163 and @xmath164 from this expression ( note that the term linear in @xmath167 vanishes if @xmath169 is chosen to be the mean value of the distances between surfaces ) .",
