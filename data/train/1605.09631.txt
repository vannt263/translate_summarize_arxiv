    "it is shown that , under some conditions , the orbit of every point in a triangular map converges to a fixed point if and only if there is no periodic orbits of prime period two . as a consequence of this conclusion , a result on global stability have been investigated .",
    "namely , if there are no periodic orbits of prime period 2 and the triangular map has a unique fixed point , then the fixed point is globally asymptotically stable .",
    "this last conclusion takes a paramount importance in some applications . particularly , in population dynamics when we are interested to investigate when local stability implies global stability .    in the current paper , we extend the ideas presents in @xcite , to a periodic non - autonomous triangular difference equations .",
    "we show , under certain conditions , global dynamics of fixed points or periodic orbits in the periodic non - autonomous difference equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is a periodic sequence of triangular maps .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec_prel ] we introduce the relevant concepts to our analysis . in the next section",
    ", we deal with periodic non - autonomous triangular maps and give the results in global dynamics and global stability in such periodic non - autonomous dynamical systems .",
    "finally , in section [ examples ] we provide illustrative examples .",
    "particularly , we study a periodic triangular leslie - gower competition model , a periodic triangular ricker type model and a periodic triangular model given by some affine combination .",
    "it is important to mention that , in the study of some periodic non - autonomous concrete models , one of the main difficulties encountered is precisely to find analytically the fixed points of the composition .",
    "this is precisely the nature of non - autonomous models . that computations are possible only in some limited models and in general , we are not able to find analytically , periodic orbits with period greater than the period of the system . hence , in this field ,",
    "is natural to use a software that help us in such computations . in the examples that we provide in this paper we are able to solve analytically the equations .",
    "we point out that some known one - dimensional examples can be extended to a higher dimension as a periodic triangular map , such as the logistic model for instance",
    ". however , the computations of the periodic points of the periodic system are possible only by numerical methods .    before end this section , we notice that recently , the study of the dynamics of triangular maps has been increase . to cite a few papers , in @xcite cima , gassul and maosa study the dynamics of a planar triangular map of the form @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in @xcite",
    "the authors study the @xmath9limit sets of some @xmath10dimensional triangular maps on the unit cube .    in the terminology of population dynamics ,",
    "triangular models are known as hierarchical models . in the paper @xcite assas",
    "et al . have been study a two - species hierarchical competition model with a strong allee effect with no immigration ( the allee effect is assumed to be caused by predator saturation ) .",
    "later on , in @xcite the authors simplified the techniques employed in the previous paper and provided a proof in global dynamics of the non - hyperbolic cases that were previously conjectured .",
    "they have been shown how immigration to one of the species or to both would , drastically , change the dynamics of the system .",
    "more precisely , it is shown that if the level of immigration to one or to both species is above a specified level , then there will be no extinction region where both species go to extinction .",

    "we begin by presenting the principal concepts and notations .",
    "let us consider a triangular non - autonomous discrete difference equation given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 and the sequence of triangular maps @xmath64 are of class @xmath28 of the form @xmath65    the orbit of an initial point @xmath66 in the system ( [ tdds ] ) is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68    @xmath69,f_{2,1}\\left[f_{1,0}(x_{1,0}),f_{2,0}(x_{1,0},x_{2,0})\\right],\\ldots,\\\\      & & f_{k,1}\\left[f_{1,0}(x_{1,0}),f_{2,0}(x_{1,0},x_{2,0}),\\ldots , f_{k,0}(x_{1,0},x_{2,0},\\ldots , x_{k,0})\\right]),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath70\\},\\ldots,\\\\      & & f_{k,2}\\left\\{f_{k,1}\\left[f_{1,0}(x_{1,0}),f_{2,0}(x_{1,0},x_{2,0}),\\ldots , f_{k,0}(x_{1,0},x_{2,0},\\ldots , x_{k,0})\\right]\\right\\}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    etc ..    define the triangular composition map as follows @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , is the composition obtained in each coordinate as illustrated before .",
    "notice that we are assuming that the composition is well defined in some subset of @xmath1 .",
    "hence , the dynamics of the system is completely determined by the triangular composition map @xmath74 .",
    "now let us consider the periodicity of equation ( [ tdds ] ) by considering @xmath75 to be the minimal period of the individual maps @xmath76 , i.e. , for each @xmath73 we have @xmath77 for all @xmath78 .",
    "under this scenario we have @xmath79 , for all @xmath78 , where @xmath80 is minimal . hence , equation ( [ tdds ] )",
    "is @xmath81periodic and its dynamics is completely determined by the composition triangular map @xmath82 .",
    "notice that we can have the following three scenarios in the dynamics of the equation ( [ tdds ] ) :    1 .",
    "* common fixed point . *",

    "notice that , since we are dealing with global dynamics , in the last case it is enough to study the qualitative properties of the fixed point @xmath101 of the full composition @xmath82 since it determines completely the dynamics of the @xmath81periodic equation ( [ tdds ] ) .",
    "the other cases follow in a similar fashion .",

    "one of the most effective ways of converting the non - autonomous difference equation ( [ tdds ] ) into a genuine discrete ( semi)dynamical system is the construction of the associated skew - product system as described in a series of papers by elaydi and sacker @xcite .",
