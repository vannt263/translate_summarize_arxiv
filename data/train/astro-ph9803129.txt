    "bl lac objects are highly variable agn emitting non - thermal radiation from radio to high energy gamma - rays , in some cases up to tev energies .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the production of radiation over such a wide energy range is believed to be the synchrotron emission followed at higher energies by inverse compton scattering ( e.g. bregman et  al .",
    "pks 2155 - 304 is a bl lac that was discovered in the x - ray band where it is one of the brightest extragalactic sources .",
    "its synchrotron power output peaks at uv frequencies ( giommi , ansari & micol 1995 ) after which a steep , highly variable , continuum follows up to the mid - hard x - ray band where a much flatter component must emerge to explain the gamma ray emission detected by cgro ( vestrand et  al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "pks 2155 - 304 has shown absorption features in the soft x - rays that have been attributed to highly ionized oxygen , possibly moving at relativistic speed toward the observer ( canizares & kruper 1984 , madejski et  al .",
    "1991 , 1997 ) .",
    "evidence for other absorption features have also been found at euv frequencies by knigl et  al .",

    "we report the results of a long ( @xmath2 2 days ) observation of pks 2155 - 305 that was carried out on 20 - 22 november 1996 as part of the _ bepposax _ science verification phase ( svp ) . here",
    "we concentrate on the analysis of the general shape of the energy spectrum and we briefly describe the time variability .",
    "a detailed timing analysis and a comprehensive study of the soft x - ray absorption features will be presented in future papers .",
    "the _ bepposax _ x - ray telescopes include one low energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs , parmar et  al .",
    "1997 ) sensitive in the 0.1 - 10 kev band , and three identical medium energy concentrator spectrometers ( mecs , boella et  al .",
    "1997 ) covering the 1.5 - 10 kev band . during the _ bepposax _",
    "svp pks 2155 - 304 was observed for more than 2 days using all the narrow field instruments .",
    "the effective exposure time in the mecs was 107,702 seconds . since at the lecs instrument",
    "can only be operated when the spacecraft is in the earth shadow the exposure time in this instrument was limited to 36,303 seconds .",
    "the data analysis was based on the linearized , cleaned event files obtained from the _ bepposax _ sdc on - line archive ( giommi & fiore 1997 ) and on the ximage package ( giommi et  al .",
    "1991 ) upgraded to support the analysis of _ bepposax _ data .",
    "the average count rate in the mecs was 1.66 cts / s ( three units ) and 1.59 cts / s in the lecs , after corrections for the instrument psf and dead time .    the phoswich detector system ( pds , frontera et  al .",
    "1997 ) is made up of four units , and was operated in collimator rocking mode , with a pair of units pointings to the source and the other pair pointing at the background , the two pairs switching on and off source every 96 seconds .",
    "the net source spectra have been obtained by subtracting the ` off ' from the ` on ' counts .",
    "the data from the four units have been summed after gain equalization .",
    "the seyfert galaxy ngc7172 is located at about 1.6 degrees from pks2155 - 304 , but we do not expect any detectable flux contamination in the 1.3 degrees fwhm field of view of the pds . the high pressure gas scintillation proportional counter ( hpgspc , manzo et  al .",
    "1997 ) observation resulted in an upper limit of @xmath3 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 between 10 and 20 kev , which is consistent with the pds data in the same energy range .",
    "pks 2155 - 304 is well known to be a highly variable source .",
    "during the ten exosat observations , which were carried out over a period of two years , pks 2155 - 304 changed its flux by about a factor 10 ( e.g. giommi et  al .",
    "1990 ) from @xmath6 to @xmath7 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 in the 2 - 10 kev band .",
    "the average flux seen by the _ bepposax _ imaging instruments of @xmath8 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5(2 - 10 kev ) is therefore a medium flux level .",
    "a detailed timing analysis of the _ bepposax _ observation of pks 2155 - 304 will be presented elsewhere . here",
    "we briefly describe and comment on the main features seen .",
    "a visual inspection of the light curve of pks 2155 - 304 ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) shows rapid ( timescale of @xmath9 seconds ) and moderate amplitude ( up to about 50% peak to peak ) intensity variations .",
    "single flares are clearly resolved with rise time approximately equal to decay time suggesting that the geometry within the emitting region is driving the observed light curve .",
    "the pks 2155 - 304 spectral slopes seen during exosat and _ ginga _ observations ( giommi et  al .",
    "1991 , sambruna et  al . 1994 , sembay et  al .",
    "1993 ) are a strong function of intensity up to a flux of @xmath10 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5above which the spectral slope does not change much with flux level .",
    "spectral variability was not observed during rosat observations when pks2155 - 304 was found to be in a very high intensity state ( brinkmann et  al .",
    "1994 ) . when x - ray spectral variability is present",
    "the spectrum hardens when the source intensity increases , a behaviour that is typical of hbl bl lacertae objects where the synchrotron break is in the uv / x - ray band ( giommi et  al .",
    "1990 , padovani & giommi 1995 ) . at the medium flux level seen during the _ bepposax _ observation spectral variations not larger than @xmath11 in slope are to be expected for the range of variability observed ( see figure 10 in sembay et  al .",
    "a simple power law fit to the _ bepposax _ data confirms that the spectral slope changed less than 0.1 from the brightest to the lowest intensity state . in the following we study the 0.1 - 100 kev spectrum using data from the entire observation .",
    "spectra were extracted from a 9.0 arcmin radius circular region around pks2155 - 304 for the lecs , ( which allows the detection of 95% of the photons at 0.28 kev ) and from a 4 arcmin region for the mecs which includes about 90% of the flux .",
    "spectral analysis was performed using the xspec package and the best instrument calibration available in november 1997 . in all cases",
    "the @xmath12 has been constrained to be equal or higher than the galactic value along the line of sight of @xmath13 @xmath4 ( measured by f.j lockman .",

    "1997 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the 0.1 - 100 kev data from the lecs , mecs and pds instruments together with a fit to a simple power law model .",
    "the residuals from the best fit clearly show a curvature between 0.1 and 8 - 10 kev and an excess above @xmath14 kev . the best fit power law energy slope , which is a reasonable representation of the data only in the 1.5 - 10 kev band , is well within the range observed with exosat ( treves et  al . 1989 ) and",
    "close to the one measured with _",
    "( sembay et  al . 1993 ) when pks2155 - 304 was observed at the same flux level of the _ bepposax _ observation .",
    "the simple power law model over the entire band is clearly unacceptable so we also fitted the data with more complex models .",
    "table 1 summarises the best fit parameters for a power law , a broken power law and a `` curved spectrum '' defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the low and high energy asymptotic slopes ( g. matt , private communication ) .",
    "the @xmath19values are unacceptably large for the power law and the broken power law model and the improvement obtained using the curved spectrum is highly significant .",
    "more complex fitting involving one or more absorption features have been attempted .",
    "the last line in table 1 shows that the addition of one notch to the `` curved '' model reduces the @xmath19to 188.5 at the expenses of adding three parameters .",
    "an f test shows that the @xmath19improvement is significant at more than 99% level .",
    "we note however , that the magnitude of the feature is very close to the current calibration limit of the lecs instrument and more observations are probably needed to confirm the detection .",
    "the power law fit to joint lecs , mecs and pds data ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) shows an excess of radiation above the steep 2 - 10 kev power law from @xmath20 and up to the highest energy where the source is detected .",
    "a different way of showing the presence of the hard component is presented in figure  [ fig3 ] where the mecs  pds spectrum of pks 2155 - 304 is divided by the _ bepposax _ spectrum of the crab nebula obtained with the same instruments .",
    "this method provides a direct way of visualising the shape of a spectrum and avoids potential problems in the cross - calibration of the instruments since uncertainties apply in equal way to both sources .",
    "since the soft x - ray spectrum of pks 2155 - 304 is steeper than that of the crab nebula , the data in figure  [ fig3 ] follow a steep power law up to about 20 kev followed by a sharp hardening with a slope similar or even flatter than that of the crab nebula ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "a fit to the 20200 pds points with a power law yields an energy index of @xmath22 .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath23 in @xmath24 @xmath4 ; @xmath25 in kev      from figure  [ fig3 ] we see that there is indication for an emission feature around 5.7 kev , consistent with a fe @xmath26 line from cold fe in the rest frame of pks 2155 - 304 ( z=0.116 falomo , pesce & treves 1993 ) .",
    "we tested the significance of the line detection both on the original data and on the spectral ratio between pks 2155 - 304 and crab .",
    "adding of a gaussian emission profile to a simple power - law continuum in the 4.-7.5 kev band yields a @xmath27 for 79 d.o.f .",
    "corresponding to an f test significance of @xmath28 .",
    "rest frame line parameters are @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "although the statistical significance is rather high and no significant calibration problems are known around 5.7 kev , we feel that more systematic analysis of _ bepposax _ data is necessary for a final confirmation of the @xmath26 line .",
    "the analysis of the average broad - band x - ray spectrum of pks 2155 - 304 in a medium intensity state shows a sharp break above 10 - 20 kev , and a possible detection of a fe @xmath31 line .",
    "intensity variability is limited to @xmath32 around a mean value and does not affect the presence of the hard tail .",
    "statistical evidence for a low energy absorption feature was also found close to the calibration limit .",
    "a hard tail above 10 kev was reported in pks 2155 - 304 during one heao1 observation ( urry & mushotsky 1982 ) but _ ginga _ observations did not confirm such a finding ( sembay et  al . 1993 ) .",
    "a spectral hardening in the hard x - ray band is expected from the ssc mechanism and is necessary to explain the gamma ray emission detected by cgro ( vestrand et  al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the detection of a fe @xmath26 line indicates the presence of cold gas , possibly associated with an accretion disk ( george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "disk emission from pks 2155 - 304 might have become detectable in the x - ray band because this part of the spectrum is no longer strongly dominated by the synchrotron component which peaks at uv frequencies ( see however the constraints posed by simultaneous optical uv photometry , urry et al 1993 ) . in this scenario the hard tail could include a component due to compton reflection from the cold disk .    from the light curve",
    "it can be seen that the flares have approximately equal rising and decaying timescales , with no indications of a plateau .",
    "it is highly unlikely that the two timescales correspond to the particle acceleration and cooling timescales , since a priori there is no reason for them to be equal . instead",
    ", these timescales may be associated with the dimension of the emitting region , and hence with the light crossing time , provided that both the electron injection and cooling processes operate on time  scales shorter than @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 is the source radius ) . in this scenario",
    "the light crossing time is the only characteristic time that can be observed ( massaro et  al . , 1996 , ghisellini et  al .",
    "1997 ) . assuming that the flares are due to quasi",
    " instantaneous injection of electrons and rapid cooling , we require that the synchrotron and self compton cooling times are equal to or shorter than @xmath33 : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the thomson scattering cross section , @xmath37 is the energy of the particles emitting at the observed frequency , @xmath38 is the magnetic energy density , and @xmath39 is the radiation energy density of the synchrotron emission ( as measured in the comoving frame ) . the ratio @xmath40 measures the relative importance of the self ",
    "compton to the synchrotron luminosity , and in pks 2155304 it can be estimated by making the ratio of the @xmath41ray luminosity ( vestrand et  al .",
    "1995 ) to the optical  uv luminosity , where the synchrotron spectrum peaks .",
    "the energy @xmath42 is related to the observed frequency @xmath43 ( assuming synchrotron radiation ) , and a limit on @xmath34 is found using @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the beaming factor .",
    "we then obtain the two limits : @xmath46 @xmath47^{1/3 } , $ ] where @xmath48 is in gauss , @xmath49 is the variability timescale measured in hours , and @xmath50 hz . assuming @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we find @xmath55 g and @xmath56 . the upper limit on the energy is particularly important , since it immediately corresponds to an upper limit on the maximum photon energies that can be emitted ( by , e.g. the inverse compton process ) : @xmath57 gev .",
    "we then conclude that pks 2155304 should not be an important tev emitter , unlike mkn 421 and mkn 501 , unless a very high degree of beaming is present .",
    "we thank g. fossati and f. haart for their contribution to the calibration of the low energy response of the lecs instrument .",
    "we are also grateful to g. matt for providing the code used for the `` curved spectrum '' model .",
