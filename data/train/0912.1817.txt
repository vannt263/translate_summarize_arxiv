    "many approaches to quantum gravity , in particular path integral approaches such as regge calculus @xcite , introduce an auxilary discretization as a regulator into the models . although this facilitates the construction and finiteness of the models , these methods jeopardize diffeomorphism symmetry , which is the continuum symmetry of general relativity .",
    "this symmetry is deeply entangled with the dynamics of the theory , therefore it might be fruitful to preserve a notion of diffeomorphism symmetry as far as possible .",
    "this could largely constrain possible quantizations of discrete models , moreover , it could provide a tool for controlling lattice effects , or , in other words , the independence from the chosen discretization ( usually a triangulation ) , see for instance the discussion in @xcite . taking care of diffeomorphism symmetry can help to obtain the correct semi ",
    "classical limit and , in particular , to obtain the correct degrees of freedom in the large scale limit ( as breaking of gauge symmetries introduces additional degrees of freedom ) .    there has been some discussion in the literature @xcite whether there exists an exact or only approximate notion of diffeomorphism invariance , or more generally gauge symmetry , in discretized gravity , in particular in ( the covariant form of ) regge calculus . for flat solutions",
    "it has been known @xcite that symmetries exist : any vertex in the bulk of the triangulation can be translated in the embedding flat space without changing flatness , and therefore without leaving the space of solutions to the regge equations . for a regular lattice these symmetries can be connected to the gauge modes in linearized gravity .",
    "but in @xcite it was shown with the help of an explicit example that these gauge symmetries are broken for regge solutions with curvature .",
    "one might take the conclusion that generically in regge calculus there are no symmetries and that the symmetries on flat space are an exception , not very relevant for the framework . as shown in @xcite , however",
    ", the symmetries on the flat background are essential for obtaining the correct number of degrees of freedom in the continuum limit . thus , assuming that generically there are no gauge symmetries and hence that all the degrees of freedom are physical would lead to a quite singular understanding of the continuum limit",
    ". indeed , in toy examples one can show that the pseudo gauge modes behave dynamically very differently from the true physical modes , having a vanishing kinematical term @xcite .",
    "also in the regge action expanded on a flat background the pseudo gauge modes obtain only a non  vanishing contribution from the ( higher than second order ) potential terms .",
    "we therefore rather speak of a symmetry breaking induced by discretization and , very importantly , by the choice of the discretized action .",
    "in fact , for 3d gravity with a cosmological constant the standard regge action leads to symmetry breaking , whereas the so  called perfect action , corresponding to choosing simplices with homogeneous curvature instead of flat ones for the discretization , does not @xcite .",
    "the breaking of symmetries has particularly severe implications for the canonical formalism .",
    "gauge symmetries of the action lead to constraints in the canonical formalism .",
    "these are the generators of the gauge transformations and hence form an algebra which is first class .",
    "the breaking of symmetries should therefore affect the constraints in some way .",
    "indeed , performing the canonical analysis of the continuum action first and then discretizing the resulting constraints leads to additional terms that convert the continuum first class constraint algebra into a second class constraint algebra , see for instance @xcite .",
    "note that this approach usually involves a change of set ",
    "up for regge calculus , namely a continuous time , but still a discretized space @xcite .",
    "an second class constraint algebra means that the constraints are not automatically preserved under time evolution . on the classical level one could deal with this issue by fixing the gauge parameters , that is lapse and shift , so that the constraints are preserved by time evolution @xcite",
    "the situation is , however , much more complicated in the quantum theory , see for instance @xcite and references therein .    nevertheless , there are attempts to derive a set of first class constraints for discretized theories .",
    "so far these succeeded only for 3d gravity , where the theory is topological , or for 4d gravity in the sector where the triangulation is such that only flat space solutions arise @xcite .",
    "as the example of 3d gravity with a cosmological constant @xcite shows , the breaking of symmetries , and therefore the appearance of discretization anomalies , is not per se bound to discretization , but depends on the choice of the discrete action and , as a result , on the discrete dynamics .",
    "there might also exist a choice of discretized constraints in the canonical framework which are first class .",
    "in fact , in @xcite it was shown that once a discrete action with symmetries has been found one can derive first class constraints .    to use this result",
    ", one has to develop a canonical formalism which exactly reproduces the dynamics defined by the action .",
    "this means in particular to allow for a discrete time evolution .",
    "( a continuous time evolution might be recovered as a symmetry , namely the translation of vertices in time direction . ) for a discretization based on triangulations such a dynamics has been proposed in @xcite based on ideas from the consistent discretization program @xcite and on the so  called tent moves @xcite , which implement discrete time evolution for triangulated manifolds . as a first step we extend these ideas to obtain a canonical description of regge dynamics .",
    "however , we can not expect to find exact constraints in the full theory , as the symmetries are broken for curved solutions . nevertheless , the existence of symmetries for flat solutions should have certain repercussions .    in order to explore these issues",
    ", we can consider an expansion of the action on a flat background . in this way the calculations become analytically tractable  the full equations of motions are so far only solvable by numerical methods .    the linearized theory , i.e.  the theory defined by the expansion of the action to quadratic order , has exact symmetries resulting from the null modes of the hessian on a flat background .",
    "hence , the canonical framework for the linearized theory should have exact constraints .",
    "we will derive these constraints explicitly for an arbitrary 3d triangulation ( embeddable into 4d flat space ) , representing the initial data hypersurface .",
    "one can show that these constraints are abelian , therefore anomaly free and preserved under time evolution as defined by the tent moves .",
    "the constraints involve the background geometry in quite a complicated way .",
    "presumably these would be hard to rederive by discretizing the continuum constraints directly .",
    "nevertheless , these constraints are abelian , which again follows from deriving them directly from the action but is not immediately straightforward to see on the canonical level . moreover , deriving the canonical framework directly from the discretized action gives the momenta an immediate geometrical meaning in terms of the discrete geometry .    for the higher order dynamics one would expect that the symmetries of the action are broken , as this is the case for the full dynamics .",
    "indeed , the equations of motion expanded to the lowest non  linear order result in consistency conditions on the background gauge , which in the case of regge calculus is associated to the positions of the inner vertices in the flat background solution . in other words ,",
    "a consistent expansion of the solutions ( analytically in the expansion parameter ) is only possible for specific choices of these background gauge parameters .",
    "the consistency conditions on the background gauge can be rewritten as the condition that the quadratic order of hamilton s principal function ( i.e.  the quadratic action evaluated on the solutions of the linearized theory ) has a vanishing derivative with respect to the background gauge parameters . in this sense",
    "the discretization is fixed such that the dynamics depends minimally on the details of the discretization , in this case the choice of background gauge parameters .",
    "in the canonical framework it will turn out that the quadratic order of the constraints depends on the background gauge parameter .",
    "these could be interpreted as background lapse and shift and hence we encounter ( lapse and shift dependent ) pseudo constraints rather than exact constraints .",
    "the requirement that the constraints should be preserved under the discrete time evolution leads to the same condition on the background gauge parameter as in the covariant formalism .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ summary ] we will give a short introduction to regge calculus and its equations of motion .",
    "subsequently , in section [ can ] , we will discuss the tent moves and the associated canonical formalism . in section [ bianchi ]",
    "we explain the origin of the gauge symmetries for flat solutions and the relation to the bianchi identities .",
    "the symmetries of the flat solution imply that the hessian of the action evaluated on these solutions will have null vectors , which we will examine in section [ deg ] .",
    "these considerations are essential in order to derive the constraints for the linearized theory in section [ lin ] . in section [ 4valent ] and section [ sechigher ] we will detail the constraints for four and higher valent vertices .",
    "we show in section [ algebra ] that the constraints are abelian and , after performing a split into linearized observables and gauge variables in section [ obs ] , we consider the dynamics of the linearized observables  that is gravitons  as generated by the tent moves in section [ dyn ] . in particular , we will show that the constraints are consistent , that is automatically preserved under time evolution .",
    "finally , we discuss the higher order dynamics in section [ higher ] .",
    "we will close with a summary and outlook .",
    "regge calculus @xcite is usually considered on a fixed triangulation @xmath0 of a space  time manifold .",
    "we will consider 4d triangulations which are built from 4simplices .",
    "a 4simplex has five tetrahedra @xmath1 , ten triangles @xmath2 , ten edges @xmath3 and five vertices @xmath4 as subsimplices .",
    "two 4simplices are glued together by identifying a tetrahedron from each 4simplex with each other .",
    "thus , a tetrahedron ( in the bulk of the triangulation ) is always shared by two 4simplices , whereas , for instance , a triangle can be shared by any number ( higher than two ) of 4simplices .",
    "the variables appearing in the regge action , which defines the equations of motion for regge calculus , are usually given by the edge lengths @xmath5 , for other choices see @xcite .",
    "these variables completely specify the ( piecewise linear ) geometry of the triangulation .",
    "in particular , from the edge lengths one can compute any 4d dihedral angle @xmath6 , which give the ( inner ) angle in the 4simplex @xmath7 between the two tetrahedra sharing the triangle @xmath2 . these dihedral angles in turn determine the curvature of the triangulation :    consider a triangle @xmath2 in a 4d triangulation .",
    "this triangle is shared by several 4simplices .",
    "a ( levi  civita ) parallel transport of a vector from one 4simplex to the next around the triangle results in a rotation of this vector by the so  called deficit angle @xmath8 in the plane perpendicular to this triangle .",
    "the deficit angle measures the curvature concentrated at the triangle .",
    "accordingly , the ( euclidean ) regge action , as a discretization of the einstein ",
    "hilbert action . ] @xmath9 , is given by [ reggeaction1 ] s=- _",
    "a__+ s_bdry , where @xmath10 denotes the area of a triangle @xmath2 .",
    "if there is a non  vanishing boundary the boundary term [ bdry ] s_=- _ a _ _ has to be added to the action in order to make the boundary value problem ( with prescribed edge lengths on the boundary ) well defined . here",
    "@xmath11 is the extrinsic curvature angle .",
    "the value @xmath12 is determined by how many pieces are glued together at the triangle @xmath2 in question .",
    "usually only two pieces are added , in which case @xmath13 to ensure that the actions for the two pieces add up correctly to the action for the glued triangulation .",
    "sometimes more pieces are glued together , in this case we will use @xmath14 for the additional pieces .    to obtain the equations of motion one",
    "has to vary the regge action ( [ reggeaction1 ] ) with respect to the length variables . here",
    "the schlfli identity is instrumental .",
    "the schlfli identity [ schlaefli ] _",
    "a_^_=0 relates the variatons @xmath15 of the dihedral angles in a 4simplex  dimensional simplex . ] .",
    "the schlfli identity can be understood to be analogous to the result that for the variation of the einstein ",
    "hilbert action @xmath16 the term with the variation of the ricci tensor leads to a total divergence . indeed , also for the regge action the variations of the deficit angles lead to a contribution only from the boundary , which are annihilated by the variation of the boundary term ( [ bdry ] ) .",
    "the resulting equation of motion obtained by varying the length of the edge @xmath3 in the bulk is [ eom0 ] -_e _ = 0 . a special kind of solutions are flat triangulations , for which all deficit angles vanish , @xmath17 . flat solutions , however , can only appear for specific choices of the boundary lengths ( if the triangulation of the boundary is sufficiently complicated ) .",
    "note that if the boundary lengths allow for a flat solution and the triangulation contains vertices in the bulk , this solution is not unique .",
    "that is , other flat solutions can be produced by translating the inner vertices in the embedding 4d flat space and changing the lengths of the inner edges adjacent to these vertices accordingly .",
    "on the other hand , one expects that for boundary data inducing curvature , the solutions are unique .",
    "a family of examples was considered numerically in @xcite and uniqueness of the solutions was found .",
    "as mentioned , the edge lengths are not uniquely determined for boundary conditions such that the regge equations admit flat solutions .",
    "there is rather a gauge freedom , which can be understood from the choice of the exact position of the inner vertices in the flat triangulation .",
    "such a gauge freedom is usually accompanied by constraints in the canonical formulation of the theory . here , however , we encounter the situation that only a particular set of solutions , namely the flat ones , exhibits an exact form of gauge freedom",
    ". we will show in section [ lin ] that this leads to constraints in the canonical formulation of linearized theories around flat solutions .",
    "later on , we will discuss the repercussions for the full dynamics of the canonical theory .    to define the canonical formulation along the lines of @xcite",
    "we will employ the so  called tent moves , introduced in @xcite .",
    "these admit the advantage to allow for a local evolution of the hypersurface on which the canonical data are defined , without changing the connectivity of its triangulation .",
    "therefore the number of edges and hence variables remains constant under the discrete time evolution . note that although we use the tent moves to derive the ( linearized ) constraints it will turn out that these are independent from this construction .",
    "the constraints are conditions on the canonical data , so that these can be consistently evolved .",
    "alternatively , ( by evolving backwards ) one can see the constraints as describing canonical data that can arise by an evolution leading to the hypersurface in question .    to define",
    "a tent move consider a 3d triangulation @xmath18 , which can be thought of as a triangulated cauchy hypersurface with time label @xmath19 .",
    "we will assume that this cauchy hypersurface is a ( piece of a ) boundary of a 4d triangulation , whose inner edge lengths satisfy the regge equations . pick a vertex @xmath20 in the cauchy surface and define a new vertex @xmath21 , which will lie in the evolved cauchy hypersurface @xmath22 .",
    "connect both vertices with an edge , which will be called ` tent pole ' .",
    "denote all other vertices in @xmath18 which @xmath20 is connected to by @xmath23 .",
    "connect also @xmath21 to the @xmath24 by edges .",
    "furthermore , we will have a tetrahedron @xmath25 ( with vertices @xmath26 ) in the evolved hypersurface @xmath22 for every tetrahedron @xmath27 in @xmath18 .",
    "hence , the triangulations of the two cauchy surfaces are the same . the analogous evolution of a tent move in 3d is depicted in figures [ 3dtm1 ] and [ 3dtm2 ] .",
    "the tent move in 3d applied to a vertex @xmath20 in a 2d cauchy hypersurface . ]",
    "the evolution can be thought of as gluing a certain piece of 4dimensional triangulation onto the hypersurface .",
    "this 4dimensional triangulation @xmath28 consists of 4simplices @xmath29 for every tetrahedron @xmath27 in @xmath18 .",
    "note that the tent move only involves @xmath30 , the ( 3d ) star of @xmath20 in @xmath18 .",
    "the star of a vertex is the union of all simplices having @xmath4 as a subsimplex .    through this gluing  on",
    "we have obtained an additional @xmath31 inner edges , namely the edges @xmath32 and the tent pole @xmath33 .",
    "we will rewrite the equations of motion for these edges into a canonical form . to this end",
    "denote by [ oct1 ] s_n & = & -__n a _",

    "we mean triangles that are in @xmath30 but are not part of @xmath36 ( or vice versa ) .",
    "there are also triangles which are part of both @xmath18 and @xmath22 .",
    "if one performs several consecutive tent moves at the vertices @xmath37 , then these triangles are part of each of the triangulations @xmath38 .",
    "hence , we choose the associated boundary term without any factor of @xmath39 , as we can not say how many pieces @xmath0 are added .",
    "( also if tent moves at neighboring vertices are performed then the action associated to these moves provides the necessary factors of @xmath39 for these triangles . )    with @xmath40 we will denote the action ( again with boundary terms ) of the original 4d triangulation without the piece @xmath28 .",
    "( alternatively , one can assume that a tent move at @xmath41 has already been performed .",
    "then @xmath40 is the action associated to @xmath42 .",
    "again , this does not matter for the equations of motion . )",
    "the equations of motion can be written as [ oct2 ] 0&= & + 0&= & + where by @xmath43 we denote the length of the tent pole @xmath33 and @xmath44 is the length of the edge @xmath45 . using @xmath46 as a generating function , we define the momenta canonically conjugate to @xmath47 by    2[oct3 ] & p_t^n:= - & & p_e^n:= - + & p_t^n+1:= & & p_e^n+1:= .",
    "note that the momentum @xmath48 identically vanishes as @xmath46 does not depend on @xmath49 .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ oct2 ] ) are now simply given by [ oct4 ] p^n_t&=&=-=p^n_t = 0 + p^n_e&=&=-=p^n_e , and thus reproduce the regge equations of motion ( [ oct2 ] ) .",

    "apart from the edges @xmath3 adjacent to @xmath20 there are more edges @xmath50 in ( the boundary of ) the 3d star of @xmath20 .",
    "the lengths of these edges do not change under a tent move at @xmath20 , however , if one performs tent moves at neighboring vertices one has to transform the momenta associated to these edges .",
    "this transformation is dictated by the requirement to reproduce the regge equation of motion for all tent moves .",
    "this is achieved by defining a generating function ( of mixed type ) [ zus2 ] f(l^e_n , l^e_n+1,t_n , l^b_n , p^n+1_b)=-_b l^b_n p_b^n+1 + s_n(l^e_n , l^e_n+1,t_n , l^b_n ) . the transformations for the variables associated to @xmath51 do not change from ( [ oct3 ] ) .",
    "for the edges @xmath50 in the boundary of @xmath30 we obtain [ zus3 ] l^b_n+1&:=&-=l^b_n + p^n_b&:= & - = p_b^n+1- .",
    "as we have @xmath52 we will often use just @xmath53 for these variables .    the canonical transformation ( [ oct3 ] , [ zus3 ] ) ( it is canonical because we defined it via a generating function ) defines the evolution of the canonical data from time step @xmath19 to time step @xmath54 .",
    "here the equation of motion @xmath55 is analogous to the primary constraints appearing in continuum ( canonical ) general relativity @xmath56 , which imply that the momentum conjugate to the lapse function vanishes .",

    "in continuum general relativity the contracted bianchi identities , [ bi1 ] ^ag_ab=0 , for the einstein tensor @xmath59 can be derived from the invariance of the einstein ",
    "hilbert action under diffeomorphisms , see for instance @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the contracted bianchi identities are geometrical identites , which follow from the properties of the curvature tensor .    from the contracted bianchi identities it follows that not all ten of einstein s field equations are independent .",
    "the identities @xmath60 provide four differential relations between the field equations ; in other words , the field equations are not fully independent from each other . given sufficient initial data , the evolution of the ten metric components is therefore not completely determined .",
    "this is related to the freedom of choosing coordinates and therefore ultimately to general covariance .",
    "similar arguments can be made for regge calculus @xcite , in which the bianchi identities hold as geometrical identities , giving relations between finite rotation matrices @xcite .",
    "there is , however , a difference to the continuum case , namely that the relation to the equations of motion can only be made approximately , only valid for small deficit angles ( and further assumptions on the ` fatness ' of the simplices @xcite ) .",
    "this means that the equations of motion will be dependent only in this approximation .",
    "however , this approximation turns into an exact identity for the linearized theory on a flat background .    in the following discussion",
    "we will adapt some arguments from @xcite to the linearized theory and clarify the origin of the degeneracy of the hessian of the regge action which we will discuss in section [ deg ] . in a triangulation of flat space one",
    "can displace the vertices in the embedding flat space without changing the deficit angles ( which are vanishing ) .",
    "the induced infinitesimal change of length variables @xmath61 is described by the vector fields @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) which can easily be computed to y^e_i= where @xmath64 is a basis in the embedding flat 4d space and @xmath65 are the 4d vectors for the edges @xmath3 adjacent to a given vertex @xmath4 ( all edges are either pointing towards the vertex or pointing away ) . for edges @xmath3 not adjacent to @xmath4",
    "the components of @xmath66 are zero .",

    "|flat so that equation ( [ bia3 ] ) shows that this hessian is degenerate and that the derivatives appearing in ( [ bia3 ] ) commute .",
    "expanding the lengths as @xmath69 we therefore find that the equations of motion for the linearized theory are linearly dependent , [ bia5 ] ^vy^e_i _ _ |flat y^e=0 .",
    "this equation is a first order expansion of the ` approximate bianchi identity ' @xcite [ 001a ] ^vy^e_i _ _ 0 , expressing that the equations of motion for the full theory are approximately dependent on each other .",
    "conversely , equation ( [ 001a ] ) can be used to show that the hessian of the regge action is degenerate ",
    "equation ( [ bia3 ] )  when the linearized bianchi identity holds .",
    "the fact that the equations of motions are not independent from each other leaves some of the variables  four per vertex  undetermined , which explains the gauge freedom appearing in the ( linearized ) theory .",
    "the linearized theory is defined by the quadratic expansion of the action around a background solution . as",
    "the linear terms vanish due to the background satisfying the equations of motions , the linearized theory is basically determined by the hessian of the action , i.e.  the matrix of second derivatives . consequently",
    ", we need to understand the properties of this hessian ( here evaluated on a flat solution ) in order to understand the properties of the linearized theory",
    ".    assume that we have performed two consecutive tent moves so that the triangulation that was added in the process is @xmath70 .",
    "this piece of triangulation has one inner vertex @xmath71 .",
    "consider this piece of triangulation as a boundary value problem , i.e.  fix all the edge lengths in the boundary @xmath72 and solve the regge equations for the @xmath73 inner edge lengths @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "furthermore , assume that the boundary lengths admit a flat solution , i.e.  a solution for which all the deficit angles at the inner triangles vanish . and embed this into flat 4d space .",
    "now perform the tent move but within the embedding of the flat space .",
    "that is , after choosing the position of the tip of the tent pole @xmath21 ( and the lengths in @xmath76 ) the lengths of the edges from the tip of the tent pole to the vertices @xmath77 are determined .",

    "hence , the extremum of the action corresponding to the original flat solution is not an isolated one , rather there are four constant directions at this extremum .",
    "accordingly , and as discussed in the previous section , the hessian of this action with respect to the inner edge lengths @xmath74 and @xmath75 has four null vectors @xmath78 , whose components we will denote by @xmath79 .    in the following we will show that from these null vectors we can define null vectors for other hessians that will appear in the dynamics of the linearized theory . to begin with we will eliminate the lengths of the tent poles as these function are auxiliary variables . to this end",

    "since a translation of a vertex @xmath20 only affects the lengths of the edges adjacent to @xmath20 this hessian still has the null vectors @xmath90 ( with the components @xmath91 vanishing ) , in particular , [ oct10d ] y^e_i + y^t_n-1_i + y^t_n_i & = & 0 . together with the equations ( [ oct9a ] ) for the components @xmath92 and @xmath93 , we obtain the result asserted in equation ( [ oct10c ] ) .",
    "next , we will show that the null vectors @xmath67 are also left or right null vectors of [ need1 ] , respectively .",
    "assume that we extremize the action @xmath87 with respect to the variables @xmath44 , fixing the variables @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "calling the corresponding solutions @xmath96 , we obtain the identities [ oct11 ] ( l^e_n-1,l_n^e ( l^e_n-1,l_n+1^e ) , l^e_n+1 ) 0 . differentiating these equations with respect to @xmath97 or @xmath98 results in + & = & 0 , + + & = & 0 , respectively .",
    "this proves the claim .    finally , let us note that the components @xmath67 can be computed from the lengths of the edges in the 3d @xmath30 only . as was noted in section [ bianchi ] , we have @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a basis in 4d flat space and @xmath65 are the 4d vectors for the edges @xmath3 , which one can obtain by embedding @xmath30 into 4d flat space . from a counting of variables argument , which can be found in section [ sechigher ] , one can deduce that the lengths in @xmath30 determine this embedding uniquely ( modulo translations and rotations ) .",
    "hence , the components @xmath67 are determined by @xmath44 and @xmath53 . as we will see in the next sections , the same holds for the constraints of the linearized theory , i.e.  these depend only on the ( fluctuation and background ) variables associated to a particular ( discrete ) time .",
    "here we have to consider the tent move equations ( [ oct3 ] ) to linear order .",
    "that is , we expand all lengths @xmath101 of the triangulation around a flat solution @xmath102 in a small parameter @xmath103 and keep only terms linear in @xmath103 in the equations . later on",
    ", we will also discuss an expansion to higher order in @xmath103 .    among the possible variations of the lengths",

    "all the solutions of the linearized theory will therefore exhibit gauge symmetries .",
    "in general , the linearized theory will inherit the gauge freedom of the background solution .    in a tent move",

    "these constraints have to be satisfied by the canonical data of the linearized theory in order to give rise to a solutions of the equations of motion .",
    "although the constraints involve only the momenta and configuration variables of linear order , variables describing the flat background solution might appear , which also involve data at the time step @xmath54 .",

    "the same applies to the computation of @xmath131 , moreover , note that @xmath136 as @xmath137 only depends on the lengths @xmath53 .",

    "note that the dependence of the matrices @xmath138 on the lengths @xmath95 drops out completely .",

    "it is easy to see that ( assuming normalization ) we have @xmath144 .",

    "these constraints for the four valent vertex can be generalized to the ` flat sector ' of 4d regge calculus , which are a special class of triangulated hypersurfaces that only allow for evolution leading to flat 4d space , see @xcite .",
    "next , we will derive the constraints at higher valent vertices",
    ". the discussion will be in many aspects parallel to the one in the last section [ 4valent ] .",
    "there is one important difference however , which is that solving the tent pole equation for higher valent vertices can also lead to solutions with non  vanishing deficit angles .",
    "nevertheless , we will see that again for the computation of the constraints we will only need the geometrical data of the hypersurface @xmath18 .    to this end , note that a tent move at a vertex @xmath4 only involves the 3d star of this vertex , i.e.  all simplices ( with their subsimplices ) that share the vertex @xmath4 .",
    "as we perform an expansion around flat space the configuration we are considering must be embeddable into flat 4d space .",
    "indeed , there are as many edge lengths in the 3d star of a vertex as one needs to determine an embedding into flat 4d space modulo translations and rotations @xcite .",
    "firstly , we will count the number of edges in the star of an @xmath145valent vertex .",
    "in addition to the @xmath145 edges adjacent to @xmath4 we have @xmath146 edges in the boundary of the star .",
    "the piecewise linear manifold condition @xcite ensures that this boundary is topologically a 2sphere . for the number of edges @xmath146 , the number of triangles @xmath147 and the number of vertices @xmath148 in a triangulated 2sphere there are two relations , the euler theorem @xmath149 and the relation @xmath150 .",
    "hence , the number of edges in the 2sphere is @xmath151 .",
    "the number of vertices is @xmath152 so that the overall number of edges in the 3d star is @xmath153 . on the other hand , if we embed the 3d star of the @xmath145valent vertex @xmath4 into 4d flat space we have to choose @xmath154 coordinates for the @xmath145 vertices .",
    "modulo the six 4d rotations this will also give @xmath153 parameters .",
    "hence , one can expect that the lengths of the edges in the 3d star uniquely determine an embedding into flat 4d space .",
    "( there might occur discrete ambiguities , however , these are fixed by the flat background solution under consideration . )    to derive the constraints we will again use the momenta @xmath155 introduced in ( [ sep4 ] ) in order to compute the matrices @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "these momenta involve the solution of the tent pole equation ( [ sep5 ] ) which , however , can now lead to solutions with non  vanishing deficit angles .",
    "that is , we have [ higher1 ] p^e_n_|flat&=&__n _ ( l_n^e,l_n+1^e,l^b )",
    "+ p^b_|flat&= & _ _ n _ n+1 _ ( l_n^e,l_n+1^e,l^b ) , only on data @xmath156 which lead to a solution of the tent pole equation with vanishing deficit angles .",
    "( fixing @xmath157 , that is the geometry of the 3d star @xmath18 , there is generically a 4parameter set of lengths @xmath95 such that one can obtain a flat solution . )",
    "this is , however , sufficient to compute the contraction of the matrices @xmath158 with the vectors @xmath66 , which is all we need to determine the constraints . according to ( [ sep7 ] ) , this contraction corresponds to the derivatives of the momenta @xmath159 in the direction of @xmath66 : [ higher2 ] y_i^e= -y^e_in^n_ee , y_i^e=-y_i^e n^n_eb . as explained in section [ bianchi ] , these vectors correspond to translations of the vertex @xmath20 and the induced change of lengths @xmath44 such that the triangulation remains flat .",
    "hence , we can still use the expression ( [ higher1 ] ) to determine the derivatives in ` flat directions ' . as for the 4valent vertex",
    "we have again @xmath160 where we now generalized the angles @xmath161 to the dihedral angle between the two tetrahedra sharing the triangle @xmath2 of the 3d star of @xmath20 or @xmath21 , respectively , embedded into 4d flat space . as discussed above , these embeddings , and hence the dihedral angles , are determined by the edge lengths @xmath157 or @xmath162 , respectively .",
    "again , the dihedral angles @xmath163 drop out after taking the derivatives with respect to @xmath132 . as explained in section [ deg ] , the vectors @xmath164 can be determined as functions of @xmath165 .",

    "the linearized constraints do not depend on the lengths in the background solution at the next time step , in particular they do not depend on background lapse and shift . in this sense",
    "the linearized constraints are independent from the tent move construction : they refer only to the data on the cauchy surface in question , hence we do not need to specify any tent moves in order to state the constraints .",
    "the constraints ( [ higher4 ] ) also generate the expected gauge transformations .",
    "the constraint @xmath166 is expected to generate the change of coordinates induced by translating the vertex @xmath20 in the direction determined by @xmath66 ( whose components describe the induced change of length variables ) .",
    "indeed , [ higher5 ] \\{y^e_n , c_i}&=&y^e_i . to determine the infinitessimal change of the momenta ,",
    "remember that translating a vertex in the embedding flat space does not change the flatness of the configurations .",
    "on such flat configurations the momenta are given by ( [ higher1 ] ) .",
    "( for the boundary edges with index @xmath50 formula ( [ higher1 ] ) gives the part that does depend on the length @xmath44 of the edges adjacent to @xmath20 . )",

    "to simplify the situation , we will consider a ` symmetry  reduced ' set  up , also used in @xcite , so that we only have two dynamical length variables , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , to deal with at each time step .",

    "this finishes the proof .",
    "+   + to summarize , for the first non  linear order of the equations of motion ( [ dd2 ] ) the following situation arises : the equations for @xmath370 have to be used to determine the second order gauge invariant observables @xmath371 , as these only appear there . for the remaining equations of motions @xmath328 , which contain only first order gauge invariant variables ( if the first order equations of motion are satisfied ) , we do not have any variables left to solve for and we seem to have an inconsistent theory .",
    "however , the remaining terms in the equations of motion for @xmath328 will generically depend on the background gauge parameters , which in a sense are zeroth order variables . indeed , these equations of motion now have a precise interpretation , namely as equations which fix the background gauge such that the second order of hamilton s principal function ( which can also be called the effective action ) depends minimally on this gauge .",
    "this also entails that one can obtain a consistent expansion to higher order only for certain choices of the gauge parameter in the background solution . for other choices",
    "one can not expand the fluctuation variables @xmath372 in a power series in @xmath103 : the solutions corresponding to the gauge degrees of freedom have a lowest order term proportional to @xmath373 , which can be interpreted as a change of the background gauge .",
    "on the other hand , at the lowest non  linear order we find that the first and second order gauge variables @xmath374 remain undetermined .",
    "for the next order , i.e.  an expansion of the action to fourth order , we expect that the equation of motion determine the first order gauge variables .",
    "+ these considerations can be tested with the parametrized harmonic oscillator ( and unharmonic generalizations ) .",
    "the action for one time step is given by [ dd9 ] s_n= - ( q_n+ q_n+1)^2 ( t_n+1-t_n ) .",

    "these configurations are solutions to the equations of motion with @xmath379 being the background gauge parameters .",
    "one finds that the second order equation of motion corresponding to @xmath380 is satisfied automatically only for @xmath381 . as a result ,",
    "the higher order terms determine the time discretization .    moreover , if one just defines @xmath382 and @xmath383 and takes the expansion of the action to third order as a definition of the dynamics one finds that the solution of @xmath384 is not analytic in @xmath103 .",
    "the lowest order rather scales with @xmath373 , that is effectively changes @xmath385 .",
    "+ in the canonical framework we can define the momenta at time step @xmath322 via the action @xmath386 and the action @xmath387 .",
    "the contraction of these momenta with the null vectors @xmath360 resulted in constraints . from the previous discussion",
    "we can conclude that the second order momenta ( defined via @xmath387 ) contracted with @xmath388 are of the form [ dd10 ] ^1y^e_i^(2)_e^1 & = & - ^1t^e_i ^1t^e_i ^(2)y^i_1 + & & - _ n=1,2 ^1t^e_i ^1t^e_i ^nt^e  _  ^(1)y^i_1 ^(1)y^_n  + & & - ^1t^e_i ^1t^e_i ^1t^e_i ",

    "note that only gauge variables @xmath389 from time step @xmath322 appear .",

    "hence , if we consider only the fluctuation variables @xmath392 with @xmath393 as true variables we can also obtain at second order relations which only involve the variables at one time step . from this point of view one can still speak of constraints .",
    "however , these constraints are not automatically preserved by time evolution anymore .",
    "the reason is that the corresponding covariant equations ( [ dd8 ] ) , which are exactly the condition for the preservation of the constraints , are not automatically satisfied .    if we also consider the ( gauge ) parameters of the background solution as zeroth order variables , however , the second order terms of the constraints ( [ dd10 ] ) will in generic cases depend on these variables from time step @xmath320 . in this sense",
    "the second order constraints are pseudo constraints",

    "these are exactly the terms which cancel automatically in the covariant equations of motion ( [ dd8 ] ) .    using a similar rewriting as in equation ( [ dd5 ] ) and the first order equations of motion , the second order part of the constraints can be written as [ dd11 ] ^(2)c_i&=&^1y^e_i^(2)_e^1 + ^1t^e_i ^1t^e_i ^(2)y^i_1 + & & + ( ^1y^e_i ^1y^e_i ) ( ^1t^-1)^_e ^(1)y^i_1 ^(1)_^1 - ( ^1y^e_i ^1t^e  _  ) ^1y^e_i ^(1)y^i_1 ^(1)y^_1 + & & + ^1t^e_i ^1t^e_i ^1t^e_i  ^(1)y^i_1 ^(1)y^i_1 + & & + _ n,n=1,2 ^1t^e_i ^nt^e_ ^nt^e _  ^(1)y^_n ^(1)y^_n  , where @xmath390 appearing in the last line can be substituted by an expression involving only variables at @xmath322 ^1t^e _ ^2t^e_ ^(1)y^_2 & = & -^1_- ^1t^e _ ^1t^e_ ^(1)y^_1 .    note",
    "that the constraints might remain exact constraints , i.e.  relations between variables ( including zero order variables ) from only one time step , to higher or even all orders .",
    "the latter is the case for tent moves at four  valent vertices , which lead to flat dynamics .",
    "the full non - linear constraints for this situation are given by ( [ flata ] ) .",
    "+ the phenomenon that not all solutions of the linearized theory can be completed to solutions of the full theory is similar to the occurrence of linearization instabilities in continuum general relativity for space times with compact spatial slices @xcite . in our case",
    "this phenomenon occurs because the solutions of the full theory are unique ( if there are no flat vertices ) , whereas the linearized solutions admit firstly freedom for the choice of the background gauge and secondly freedom in the choice of the first",
    " order gauge parameters .",
    "the consistency conditions eliminate this gauge freedom order by order .",
    "there is an important difference to the linearization instabilities appearing in @xcite : whereas there the additional conditions are on the first order ( physical ) modes , the consistency conditions here fix the zeroth  order background gauge variables ( and presumably the higher order equations fix the higher order gauge variables ) .      here",
    "we will consider the consistency equation arising from the second order equations of motion for the symmetry reduced five valent vertex , described in section ( [ beispiel1 ] ) .",
    "the variables we have to deal with are the lengths @xmath394 for @xmath395 .",
    "we fix data at @xmath321 and consider the equations of motion with respect to @xmath396 .    to begin with",
    ", we have to ( numerically ) find solutions for the lengths of the tent pole @xmath323 .",
    "this can be done to second order in an expansion around the flat configuration determined by the initial values @xmath397 and [ hope01 ] ^(0)t_0= + , ^(0)t_1=-where @xmath1 is the background gauge parameter , determining the position of the vertex at @xmath322 in the background flat space time .",
    "note that @xmath398 , the background data at @xmath320 are independent of @xmath1 .    this way , we can obtain the effective action @xmath87",
    "expanded to third order . from this action",
    "we can obtain the first and second order equations of motion for @xmath399 . solving the first order equation corresponding to the derivative with respect to @xmath400 for @xmath401 and using the solution in the other first order equation of motion",
    ", one will find that it is automatically satisfied .",
    "this is the signature of the exact gauge freedom for the linearized theory .",
    "using the first order solution we can solve the second order equation corresponding to the derivative with respect to @xmath400 for @xmath402 .",
    "again , we use this solution in the other second order equation corresponding to the derivative with respect to @xmath403 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath404 we find that we have to solve the equation ( ignoring terms of order @xmath405 arising due to numerical errors ) [ hope02 ] 0 & = & -0.5464921 ( ^(1)y_0^a)^2 - 0.9715415 ( ^(1)y_0^b)^2 + 1.4573123 ( ^(1)y_0^a)(^(1)y_0^b ) + & & + 1.0936310 ( ^(1)y_0^a ) ( ^(1)y_2^a ) - 1.3269178 ( ^(1)y_0^a ) ( ^(1)y_2^b ) + & & - 1.4581747 ( ^(1)y_0^b ) ( ^(1)y_2^a ) + 1.7692237 ( ^(1)y_0^b)(^(1)y_2^b ) + & & - 0.5471391 ( ^(1)y_2^a)^2- 0.8054603 ( ^(1)y_2^b)^2 + 1.3277030 ( ^(1)y_2^a ) ( ^(1)y_2^b ) .",
    "however , as expected from the previous discussion , all variables at time step @xmath322 have dropped out . we thus have to find a value for the background gauge parameter @xmath1 such that the remaining second order equation is satisfied .",
    "a priori one would expect that the value of @xmath1 has to depend on the boundary data @xmath406 with @xmath321 .",
    "but ( as for the parametrized harmonic oscillator ) it turns out , that this equation can be solved independently from these first order boundary data . all coefficients in ( [ hope02 ] ) which are",
    "non  vanishing for @xmath404 vanish simultaneously ( within numerical accuracy ) for @xmath407 .",
    "we conjecture that there is a general mechanism which ensures that the second order terms @xmath408 can be made to vanish independently of the value of the first order boundary data .",
    "in this work we introduced a canonical formalism for discretized gravity which exactly reproduces the dynamics as defined by the discrete action . in this way also the exact and approximate symmetries of the action are reproduced as first class constraints and pseudo constraints , respectively . for linearized regge calculus , which exhibits exact gauge symmetries ,",
    "we obtained abelian constraints valid for arbitrary triangulated cauchy surfaces .",
    "the momenta and constraints are local functions ( as opposed to the suggestion in @xcite ) and have an immediate geometric interpretation as generators of vertex displacements .",
    "the constraints can be shown to commute and to be preserved by the tent move dynamics as defined by the quadratic order of the action .",
    "although this can be proved by staying entirely in the canonical framework , it is much easier to remember that the constraints follow from the symmetries of the action .",
    "for instance , the constraints are abelian because second derivatives ( of the action ) commute .",
    "discretized constraints are often derived by performing first a canonical analysis of the continuum action and then discretizing the resulting constraints .",
    "this often leads to a change of the constraint algebra from first to second class @xcite , i.e.  the constraints close only modulo terms proportional to some power in the lattice spacing .",
    "this work suggests to not only qualify discretized constraints under this criterium but to also consider the properties of the constraints near solutions relevant for the continuum limit  here the flat solutions .",
    "we argued that the constraints to the first non  linear order will aquire some dependence on the background gauge parameters and turn therefore into pseudo constraints @xcite .",
    "these pseudo constraints are not automatically preserved under tent move evolution anymore .",
    "rather some of the equations of motion turn into consistency conditions , selecting a specific background gauge and ensuring that the constraints are now preserved under time evolution .",
    "these consistency conditions can be rewritten as the derivatives with respect to the background gauge parameters of the quadratic part of hamilton s principal function .",
    "note that this quadratic part can be computed in the linearized theory .",
    "despite the fact that the linearized theory displays exact constraints and gauge symmetries ( in the fluctuation variables ) , the associated hamilton s principal function is not independent of the background gauge , or in other words the discretization .",
    "these findings entail that a consistent perturbative expansion is only supported for specific background choices . for other choices solutions",
    "are not analytic in the expansion parameter .",
    "although the background gauge is fixed by the lowest non  linear order dynamics the first and second order gauge variables remain undetermined .",
    "we expect that these are fixed one after the other in the higher order dynamics , so that in the @xmath19-th order dynamics the @xmath19th and @xmath290th order of the gauge variables remain undetermined .",
    "we want to underline that although we found pseudo constraints starting with second order for regge calculus , there might be alternative discretization schemes which lead to first class discrete constraints for the full theory .",
    "in fact , as was shown in @xcite for regge calculus with a cosmological constant , where the symmetries are broken , it is possible to find an alternative discretization of the action with exact symmetries also for curved solutions .",
    "the methods used in @xcite are the so  called perfect actions , which exactly reproduce the dynamics ( and therefore symmetries ) of the continuum .",
    "these perfect actions can be obtained by a coarse graining procedure ( from the continuum ) .",
    "obtaining the perfect action for 4d gravity will be very complicated , but might be achievable in a perturbative approach @xcite .",
    "the considerations in this paper give necessary prerequisites towards this end .",
    "if one is only interested in a particular class of solutions , for instance almost homogeneous solutions for cosmological applications , one might try to derive improved actions by adapting the discretization to the chosen background . in the case of cosmology",
    ", it would be interesting to have an action which displays gauge symmetries for homogeneous solutions and in this way ensure the correct number of propagating degrees of freedom on cosmological backgrounds .",
    "see also @xcite for related discussions in loop quantum cosmology and @xcite for a proposal for using tent moves in a ( quantum ) cosmological setting .",
    "we hope that these results can be useful for connecting covariant and canonical approaches to quantum gravity , in particular spin foam models and canonical loop quantum gravity .",
    "this has been achieved in 3d @xcite ( where the symmetries are exact for the full non  linear theory ) but is an outstanding problem in 4d @xcite .",
    "spin foam models can be understood as partition functions for a discretized theory @xcite . in canonical loop quantum gravity",
    "the central ingredient defining the dynamics is given by the quantum constraints @xcite .",
    "this work suggests a derivation of a canonical quantum theory from the covariant one , that is a canonical theory directly derived from the amplitudes associated to spin foam models .",
    "as spin foam models are based on a discretization of the plebanski action one expects the symmetries to be broken .",
    "hence , one can doubt whether on the discrete level , i.e.  before taking any continuum limit or sum over triangulations , ( exact ) quantum constraints exist for the full theory that would reproduce the dynamics defined by the spin foam model .",
    "nevertheless , it should be possible to define a canonical dynamics with discrete time that reproduces the spin foam amplitudes .",
    "to this end it would be useful to perform a canonical analysis of the discretized plebanski action , a task that was only recently achieved for the continuum action in @xcite . in particular , in @xcite",
    "one can find the relation between the canonical phase spaces of discretized plebanski theory and of regge calculus .",
    "also in @xcite it was pointed out that there exists a class of triangulations which admits only flat solutions and on which the symmetries are therefore exact . for this class of triangulations",
    "it might therefore be possible to derive quantum constraints from the quantum amplitudes . to accomplish this",
    ", the symmetries of the amplitudes have to be better understood .",
    "interesting results in this direction and a connection to the quantum constraints can be found in @xcite .",
