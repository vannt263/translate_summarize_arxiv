    "since sizes and structural parameters of globular clusters ( gcs ) in different gc systems ( gcss ) have first been obtained , it has become clear that some of these properties correlate with global properties of their host galaxies ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the existence of the so called fundamental plane relation for an increasing number of studied gcss seems to confirm that gcs populate a narrow region in this parameter space @xcite . however , there are puzzling trends that are still awaiting confirmation and need to be addressed using larger samples of gcs .",
    "it is necessary to study structural parameters of gcs and gc - like objects in different environments before definitive statements can be made regarding their formation . among the structural parameters that can be studied , the effective ( or half - light ) radius is of particular importance .",
    "models have shown that this quantity remains fairly constant throughout the entire gc lifetime @xcite , making it a good indicator of proto - gc sizes that are still observable today . a decade ago",
    ", hst observations unveiled a systematic size difference between red and blue gcs @xcite .",
    "since then , multiple studies have found that the blue gcs are between @xmath4 larger than their metal - rich counterparts in both spirals and early  type galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , most of these studies have made use of hst observations and examine only the innermost regions of the galaxy or small fields in regions at galactocentric distances greater than the galaxy s effective radius .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the systematic size difference between red and blue gcs is caused merely by a projection effect . since red ( metal - rich )",
    "gcs are found to be more centrally concentrated than blue ( metal - poor ones ) in early type galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) , the red gcs will appear to lie , on average , at a smaller galactocentric distance .",
    "the red clusters will on average be smaller than the blue clusters assuming that both types shares the same relation between the gc size and galactocentric distance .",
    "the relation r @xmath5 was first found in the milky way by @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the difference between the cluster sizes should be most apparent at small galactocentric distance and should decrease strongly beyond 1 galaxy effective radius @xcite .",
    "alternatively , @xcite suggests that this effect could be explained by an intrinsic difference between metal - rich and metal - poor gcs . assuming half - mass radii that are independent of metallicity , effects of mass segregation combined with a metallicity - dependent stellar lifetime should lead to different sizes between the blue and red clusters .",
    "the brightest stars would be more massive and more centrally concentrated for the metal - rich gcs .",
    "this scenario should have little to no dependence on a cluster s distance from the center of its parent galaxy .",
    "in a recent study , @xcite analysed the gcs of ngc 4594 ( sombrero , at a distance of @xmath6 mpc ) using a six - image mosaic from hst / acs .",
    "they confirm that within the inner 2 arcmin ( 2.2 r@xmath0 ) , the metal - rich gcs are , on average , @xmath7 smaller than the metal - poor clusters .",
    "however , the size difference becomes negligible at @xmath8 arcmin , corresponding to @xmath9 r@xmath0 , where r@xmath10 arcmin @xcite .    to further understand the sizes of red and blue clusters ,",
    "we need a homogeneous survey of a gcs with the ability to eliminate contaminating sources , high resolution to measure structural parameters , and over a large range in galactocentric distance .",
    "ngc 5128 is the nearest giant elliptical galaxy , at a distance of 3.8 mpc @xcite .",
    "its gcs are thus easily resolvable with sub - arcsecond seeing @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present effective radius results for 337 gcs from the @xcite catalog that are confirmed gcs by either radial velocity measurement from various studies ( see the references in * ? ? ? * ) or are resolved by hst / acs images @xcite .",
    "we also present the effective radii of 27 gcs newly confirmed through radial velocity measurements using the baade 6.5-m telescope with the instrument ldss-2 ( data in preparation for publication ) .",
    "this list represents a clean sample of confirmed clusters .",
    "all of these also have ellipticities less than 0.4 and effective radii less than 8 pc , both of which are consistent with _",
    "normal _ gc properties in ngc 5128 .",
    "we find that only an additional @xmath11 of gcs from the @xcite catalog have effective radii greater than the 8 pc boundary we have imposed here ( to be discussed in detail in gmez & woodley , 2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "those few gcs are not considered here as our purpose is to establish the effective radius trends within the bulk of the gc population .",
    "on the night of april 9 , 2006 , 25 fields were imaged with the magellan 6.5 m telescope using the inamori magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ) . in the highest imaging resolution ,",
    "imacs offers a fov of 15.4 arcmin on a side , composed of a mosaic of 8 2kx4kcds with a scale of 0.111 arcsec / pixel .",
    "our observational material will be fully discussed in harris et al .",
    "2008 ( in preparation ) .",
    "the total field of view of our images is roughly 1.2 x 1.2 square degrees and the average seeing is about 0.5 `` across the entire field with individual frames ranging from 0.35 '' to 0.7 \" .",
    "images were acquired through b ( on 16 of the 25 fields ) and r ( on all 25 fields ) filters with both 10 second and 300 second exposures to avoid saturation of the brightest clusters .",
    "we have identified all gcs in the catalog of @xcite on our imacs frames 25@xmath12 1.16@xmath13 ( j2000 ) and gc0002 with corrected declination of -43@xmath14 02@xmath15 42.9@xmath16 ( j2000 ) . ] .",
    "we have run the code ishape @xcite individually on each gc in our r filtered imacs frames , using a stellar point spread function ( psf ) modelled from the chip in which the cluster is located .",
    "for this , typically 20 - 30 stars were chosen in each frame and measured with standard tools in iraf .",
    "ishape convolves the psf with analytical profiles and compares the result with the input image until a best match is achieved .    as the analytical model",
    ", we chose king ( 1962 ) profiles , given their simplicity and because they are known to provide a good fit to a large family of gcs in different environments .",
    "moffat functions were also tried , but they do not improve the fits except for a handful of large and very elliptical sources that we are not considering for the present study .",
    "they will be discussed as special cases in a forthcoming paper .",
    "possible systematic effects in the sizes , arising from the choice of a particular model are discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , the effective radius seems to be independent of the model for sources that have a similar extension to the stellar psf , as in our case . for a recent comparison between different models ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite profiles are defined by a core - radius r@xmath17 and a concentration index , which we define here as @xmath18 r@xmath19r@xmath17 , where r@xmath20 is the tidal radius of the cluster .",
    "usually , the concentration parameter is the most uncertain one to constrain @xcite , but given the high spatial resolution of our imacs images , we were able to fit this along with the ellipticity , position angle ( pa ) and r@xmath17 .",
    "the sizes quoted by ishape were transformed into effective radii using the approximation r@xmath21r@xmath22 , good to @xmath23 for @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the median value for the concentration parameter for gcs in ngc 5128 was @xmath25 uncertainties in the effective radius were estimated by the standard deviation of the determined value using king profiles with fixed concentration indices of 15 , 30 , and 100 .",
    "these concentration parameters were chosen based on typical values observed in our galaxy as well as the concentration parameters fit freely with ishape for the ngc 5128 data .",
    "the r@xmath2 determined for any given cluster with varying concentration parameters does not vary more than @xmath26 for the average gc .",
    "the concentration parameter , c , is the most uncertain of the fitted parameters .",
    "the extension of the gc is a secondary uncertainty .",
    "a gc at the distance of ngc 5128 , with an effective radius of 6 pc , would span a diameter of 0.6 `` , marginally larger than the typical stellar fwhm . for smaller or more compact objects ,",
    "the instrisic size can be as small as 0.1 '' , i.e. completely blurred even with sub - arcsecond imaging .",
    "we have 69 gcs in common with the hst / acs structural parameter study of @xcite .",
    "their r@xmath2 values , derived through an isophotal analysis of the resolved clusters , and discussed fully in @xcite , serve as an external comparison and quality test for our measurements . figure  [ fig : acs_imacs ] shows clearly that there is good agreement in the @xmath27 values determined by these independent techniques .",
    "we have also examined our measured r@xmath2 as a function of ellipticity and luminosity and also found no notable correlation .    in an upcoming paper , ( gmez & woodley , 2008 , in preparation )",
    ", we will discuss the structural parameters in detail as well as the new gcs discovered with the baade 6.5 m telescope ( mentioned above ) that have been used in this study .",
    "here , we focus on the dependence of the gc sizes as a function of galactocentric radius , r@xmath3 for the gc subpopulations . a metallicity break has been chosen to represent the red or metal - rich ( [ fe / h]@xmath28 ) and blue or metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath29 ) subpopulations of clusters , following the studies of @xcite",
    ". the [ fe / h ] values were obtained from a @xmath30 transformation @xcite assuming e(b - v ) = 0.11 @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig : re_feh ] and [ fig : n_re ] show that , within one effective radius of the galaxy , the red clusters are significantly smaller than the blue ones by @xmath31 . as galactocentric distance increases",
    ", however , this difference tends to disappear and beyond a distance of 12 kpc ( corresponding to @xmath32 r@xmath0 ) , no difference remains .",
    "we have performed a spearman test to study the trend between metallicity and r@xmath33 .",
    "the spearman non - parametric rank - correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1 , with -1 for a complete anti - correlation , 0 for no correlation and 1 for a complete correlation .",
    "we found the coefficients to be -0.4 for r@xmath34 r@xmath0 , -0.1 for 1 r@xmath35 r@xmath36 2 r@xmath0 , 0.1 for 2@xmath37 r@xmath38r@xmath0 , and 0.1 for r@xmath39 r@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the spearman test gives the probability that the two datasets are uncorrelated as well .",
    "the values read 0.01 , 0.19 , 0.43 and 0.34 , respectively , for the four radial bins presented above .",
    "thus , there is a small , but virtually confirmed anti - correlation within 1 r@xmath0 .",
    "this size trend is even more clear in figure  [ fig : n_re ] . within 1 r@xmath0 of the galaxy ,",
    "the metal - rich and metal - poor clusters have median effective radii of 1.94@xmath40 and 2.98@xmath41 pc , respectively .",
    "however , outside of 1 r@xmath0 , the median r@xmath2 is identical within uncertainties .    figure  [ fig : re_rgc ] shows r@xmath33 as a function of projected r@xmath3 for the gcs in ngc 5128 and in the milky way .",
    "the metal - poor gcs in ngc 5128 do not follow the r@xmath2r@xmath3 relationship that is evident in the metal - rich gcs .",
    "the milky way data , on the other hand , has been shown to host the r@xmath2r@xmath3 relationship for both metallicity populations , first noted by @xcite , using a 3-dimensional r@xmath3 . however , in projection , the metal - poor gcs in the milky way do not appear vastly different from those in ngc 5128 .",
    "the existence of a systematic difference in the effective radii of blue and red clusters has been extensively studied in other galaxies , with blue clusters typically found to be @xmath42 larger than red ones ( see section  [ sec : intro ] ) . however , in ngc 5128 , @xcite did not find any correlation between color and size for a sample of 27 gcs using hst / wfpc2 .",
    "in a subsequent study , @xcite found the red gcs to have _ larger _ median sizes compared to the blue clusters for a sample of 38 objects , with magellan / magic .",
    "both studies were based on small field images , involved small sample sizes , and were centered at large r@xmath3 .",
    "_ smallest _",
    "r@xmath3 , this was more than 2 times farther than the r@xmath0 of the galaxy light . ) according to @xcite , the average sizes of red and blue clusters should be similar at about 1 r@xmath0 and beyond , if projection effects are to account for the size difference .",
    "the results from @xcite and @xcite are consistent with this scenario , bearing in mind the low number statistics of their studies .",
    "the only two studies thus far with a large enough sample of gcs that also extends beyond 1 r@xmath0 , are this work and @xcite .",
    "both show that the red clusters are smaller than the blue within 1 r@xmath0 , _ and that they are identical in size beyond this distance_. in the acs virgo cluster survey , @xcite have studied the sizes of gcs in 67 early - type galaxies .",
    "their analysis reaches about 3 times the effective radius of the massive ellipticals studied and these gcss dominate their sample . however , their results , favoring red clusters being consistently smaller than blue clusters are dominated by the inner gcs in these galaxies .    our sample , consists of only confirmed gcs which have been analyzed homogeneously ,",
    "span a projected galactocentric distance of up to 50 kpc , i.e. , 8 galaxy r@xmath0 .",
    "thus , we are able to draw conclusions about the origin of the size difference with a sample that is both uncontaminated and much more spatially extended than in previous studies .    as is evident from figs .  [",
    "fig : re_feh ] , [ fig : n_re ] and [ fig : re_rgc ] metal - poor clusters do not show an r@xmath2r@xmath3 relationship .",
    "@xcite analyse this trend for metal - poor clusters in their samples and conclude that they are too shallow compared to the galaxy for the projection effects to account for the size difference .",
    "our results for ngc 5128 agree with this , but at the same time make it clear that the metal - poor subpopulation does not represent the global r@xmath2r@xmath3 trend .",
    "in fact , only _ metal - rich _ clusters show it .",
    "therefore , projection effects can account for the observed size differences without the need of intrinsic formation and destruction mechanisms between red and blue clusters .",
    "using a contaminant - free sample of 364 gcs in ngc 5128 , confirmed with radial velocity measurements or by resolved hst images , we have measured effective radii using ishape .",
    "our results indicate that the blue or metal - poor clusters do not show any significant r@xmath33r@xmath3 relation .",
    "however , the red or metal - rich gcs do show a steep relation in which red clusters within 1 r@xmath0 of the galaxy s light are @xmath1 smaller than the blue clusters . beyond this distance",
    "there is no indication for a size difference between the two metallicity populations .",
    "this finding in ngc 5128 , not previously seen in any other early - type galaxy , supports the more tentative findings of the sombrero galaxy s gcs @xcite .",
    "both studies support the idea that the size differences are most likely caused by projection effects @xcite and not by intrinsic physical differences between the two subgroups .",
