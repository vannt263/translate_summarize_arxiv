    "why did late nineteenth century composers , such as frank , liszt , mahler , and wagner , continue to privilege consonant triads over other tone collections , while simultaneously moving away from the diatonic scale and classical tonality ?",
    "richard cohn proposes an answer in @xcite , independent of acoustic consonance : major and minor triads are preferred because they can form _ maximally smooth cycles_. consider for instance the following sequence of consonant triads , called a _ hexatonic cycle _ by cohn .",
    "@xmath3 we have indicated major chords with capital letters and minor chords with lowercase letters .",
    "although the motion from a major chord to its parallel minor , e.g. @xmath4 to @xmath5 , @xmath6 to @xmath7 , and @xmath8 to @xmath9 , is distinctly non - diatonic , this sequence has cogent properties of importance to late - romantic composers , as axiomatized in cohn s notion of maximally smooth cycle @xcite .",

    "* all of the chords are in one `` set class , '' in this case each chord is a consonant triad . *",
    "every transition is _ maximally smooth _ in the sense that two notes stay the same while the third moves by the smallest possible interval : a semitone .",
    "cohn considered movement along this sequence transformationally as an action by a cyclic group of order 6 . additionally , david clampitt considered in @xcite movement along this sequence via @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and also via certain rotations and reflections . as usual , we denote by @xmath10 the `` parallel '' transformation that sends a major or minor chord to its parallel minor or major chord , respectively .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the `` leading tone exchange '' transformation , which moves the root of a major chord down a semitone and the fifth of a minor chord up a semitone , so the @xmath11 sends consonant triads @xmath5 to @xmath6 , and @xmath7 to @xmath8 , and @xmath9 to @xmath4 .",
    "the hexatonic cycle is then positioned in network , with alternating @xmath10 and @xmath11 transformations between the nodes .",

    "the pentatonic sets and the diatonic sets each support only one long cycle , which exhausts all 12 of their respective exemplars .",
