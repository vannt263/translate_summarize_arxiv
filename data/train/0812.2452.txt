    "the observational data on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature fluctuations obtained in the ground - based , balloon and space experiments became the key test of cosmological models of the universe and the main source for the determination of their parameters .",
    "the data obtained in the space mission wmap ( wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) @xcite are the most outstanding achievement of the modern cosmology .",
    "they have given us the possibility to estimate the cosmological parameters ( see @xcite and citing therein ) with accuracy that practically equals to one of theoretical predictions because of the non completeness of physical processes governing the cmb temperature fluctuations and polarization as well as the accuracy of analytical approximations and numerical computations .",
    "the important part of the theory of cmb anisotropy is the kinetics of cosmological recombination of primary plasma and calculation of free electrons number density at decoupling of thermal electromagnetic radiation and matter .",
    "the bases of the theory of cosmological recombination have been founded by zeldovich @xcite and peebles @xcite in 1968 . in the following papers @xcite the main processes",
    "were particularly studied and a few - percent accuracy of calculations of recombination kinetics was achieved .",
    "the most complete analysis of the kinetics of cosmological recombination was carried out by seager et al .",
    "( 2000 ) @xcite , where the multi - level ( @xmath0 levels ) structure of hydrogen and helium atoms , non - equilibrium kinetics and , practically , all processes determining the thermal state of plasma were taken into account .",
    "the authors have created also the publicly available code recfast @xcite , which provides the computation of electron number density with accuracy @xmath1 .",
    "it is used in the cmbfast @xcite , cambcode @xcite , cmbeasy @xcite codes for calculation of power spectrum of matter density perturbations as well as cmb anisotropy . since the accuracy of the wmap observational data is close to the theoretical predictions one and",
    "is expected to be few times higher in the planned experiment planck , the analysis of physical processes not taken into account until now becomes actual . among them are the transitions between the high levels of atoms of hydrogen and helium , their fine structure and elaboration of spontaneous , collision and induced transition rates , absorption and scattering of thermal radiation along the line of sight , isotope composition , molecular formation and dissociation , etc . in recent years these and other effects have been actively studied in order to improve an accuracy of computation of cosmological recombination @xcite . in our papers",
    "@xcite the influence of adiabatic density perturbations on the number densities of ionized fractions has been studied .",
    "it was shown that at decoupling epoch the amplitude of relative perturbations of electron number density is 4 - 5 times higher than amplitude of relative perturbations of total baryon density .",
    "the reason for such difference is the considerably higher sensitivity of hydrogen and helium photoionization rate to temperature fluctuations than the spontaneous recombination rate one .",
    "it is clear , since the ionization of hydrogen and helium is provided by quanta of background thermal radiation of wien spectrum range ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the higher amplitude of relative density perturbations of free electron component , meanwhile , is not imprinted in the amplitude of angular power spectrum of cmb temperature fluctuations in the linear approach ] .",
    "however , it is not excluded that this effect has imprint in the map of the cmb primary polarization",
    ". therefore , in this paper we study more detailed this effect for adiabatic perturbations of different scale at region of acoustic peaks to compare the power spectra of number density perturbations of different compoments at decoupling .",
    "all computations were carried out using the code _",
    "drecfast.f _ which is described particularly in @xcite and is publicly available at _ http://astro.franko.lviv.ua/@xmath3novos/_. research of the paper is restricted by the @xmath4cdm - model with parameters determined on the basis of data on cmb temperature anisotropy , large - scale structure and dynamics of expansion of the universe .",
    "combination of the wmap data @xcite with different datasets on large - scale structure of the universe , dynamics of its expansion , etc .",
    "gives somewhat different values of parameters .",

    "computations of cosmological recombination and power spectra of electron number density perturbations will be carried out for @xmath4cdm - model with two sets of the best - fit parameters : @xmath18 , @xmath19 @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 @xcite and @xmath24 , @xmath25 @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the angular power spectra of cmb temperature fluctuations calculated for them are practically identical @xcite .",
    "important feature of the cosmological recombination of helium and hydrogen in the @xmath4cdm - model is that it occurs when the total energy density of thermal radiation approximately is comparable to baryon matter one : @xmath30 .",
    "henceforth we will use the following definitions : @xmath31 and @xmath32 are number density of neutral and ionized hydrogen atoms ; @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are number densities of neutral , singly and double ionized helium ; @xmath36 is number density of free electrons ; @xmath37 is total number density of hydrogen nuclei ; @xmath38 is total number density of helium nuclei .",

    "it begins to recombine and @xmath64 ions appear .",
    "recombination of @xmath64 occurs in the conditions of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , so , the ionization fraction of helium , @xmath65 , is described by saha equation : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is matter temperature , @xmath68 is mass of electron , @xmath69 is planck constant , @xmath70 is boltzmann constant , @xmath71 is ionization potential of heii . since at this epoch both hydrogen and helium are completely ionized ( @xmath57 , @xmath56 , @xmath72 ) we have @xmath73 and @xmath74 , so equation ( [ sahaheiii ] ) can be easily solved for @xmath75 . using it one can easily check that already at @xmath76 all helium atoms become singly ionized .",

    "now @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "for accurate calculation of @xmath81 we must have the exact value of @xmath86 . despite @xmath87 ,",
    "the decrease of @xmath32 in 0.1% caused by the hydrogen recombination leads to the variation of @xmath88 comparable to one caused by @xmath80 recombination because of the domination of hydrogen ( @xmath89 ) .",
