    "in recent years , modeling traffic flow has been the subject of comprehensive studies by statistical physicists @xcite . needless to say",
    "many general phenomena in vehicular traffic can be explained in general terms with these models .",
    "distinct traffic states have been identified and some of these models have found empirical applications in real traffic @xcite . in these investigations , various theoretical approaches namely microscopic car - following models @xcite , hydro - dynamical coarse - grained macroscopic models @xcite , and gas - kinetic models @xcite have been developed in order to find a better quantitative as well as qualitative understanding toward vehicular traffic phenomena .",
    "recently as an alternative microscopic description , probabilistic cellular automata ( pca ) have come into play ( for an overview see refs .",
    "this approach to theoretical description of traffic flow is one of the most effective and well - established ones and there is a relatively rich amount of results both numeric and analytic in the literature @xcite .",
    "+ in pca models , space ( road ) , time and velocities of vehicles are assumed to take discrete values .",
    "this realization of traffic flow provides pca as an ideal tool for the computer simulation .",
    "one of the prototype pca models is the so - called _ nagel - schreckenberg _ ( na - sch ) model @xcite which describes a single - lane traffic flow .",
    "although the initial observations of the na - sch model were numerical , shortly thereafter analytical technique were also proposed @xcite .",
    "analytical treatments to ca are difficult in general .",
    "this is mainly due to the discreteness and the use of parallel ( synchronous ) updating procedures which produce the largest correlation among the vehicles with regard to other updating schemes .",
    "+ soon after its introduction , the na - sch model was extended to account for more realistic situations such as multi - lane traffic flow @xcite , bi - directional roads @xcite and urban traffic @xcite . in multi - lane traffic ,",
    "fast cars are capable of passing the slow ones by using the fast - lane .",
    "the possibility of lane - changing allows for these models to exhibit non - trivial and interesting properties which are exclusive to multi - lane traffic flow . despite the quite large approximative methods applied to single - lane na - sch based models , there are few analytical approaches to multi - lane traffic flow @xcite .",
    "one main reason is the large number of rules in pca modeling multi - lane traffic . in reality",
    ", a driver attempting to overtake the car ahead ( in a uni - directional road ) has to take the following criteria into consideration : + 1 ) there must be enough forward space in the passing - lane + 2 ) there must be enough backward space in passing - lane so that no accident could occur between two simultaneously passing cars .",
    "+ moreover , in bi - directional roads additional criteria are necessary for a successful passing ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to introduce an analytical approach to study a uni - directional two - lane road .",
    "the approach we use is to some extent similar to pca , however basic differences are distinguishable .",
    "the major distinction is concerned with the type of updating scheme .",
    "in contrast to pca which are realized in parallel update , our models are based on time - continuous random sequential update .",
    "the mechanism of modeling the two - lane traffic we use , is based on the stochastic reaction - diffusion processes , however the rules have roots in the na - sch rules .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section two we define the first model ( model i ) and interpret the rules in terms of those in na - sch model .",
    "section three starts with the hamiltonian description of the related master equation and continues with mean field rate equations and their solutions .",
    "the results of the numerical simulation of the model i ends this section .",
    "next we introduce the second model ( model ii ) in section four which is formulated in symmetric as well as asymmetric versions and follow the same steps performed in section three to obtain the fundamental diagrams of the both versions .",
    "the paper ends with some concluding remarks in section five .",
    "in the first model , a uni - directional two - lane road is approximated by a set of two parallel one dimensional chains , each with @xmath1 sites .",
    "the periodic boundary condition applies to both .",
    "cars are considered as particles which occupy sites of the chains .",
    "two type of cars exist in the system : slow cars which are denoted by @xmath2 and fast cars denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "also @xmath4 represents an empty site .",
    "each site of the chains is either empty , occupied by a slow or by a fast car .",
    "+ fast cars can pass the slow ones with certain probabilities while approaching them .",
    "the bottom lane is the home - lane and cars are only allowed to use the top lane for passing .",
    "once the passing process is achieved , they should return to the home - lane .",
    "this realization of a two - lane road is regarded as `` _ asymmetric _ '' type .",
    "nonetheless `` _ symmetric _ '' type could also be implemented where passing from the right is allowed as well .",
    "+ in model i , we restrict ourselves to `` _ asymmetric _ '' type .",
    "the state of the system is characterized by two sets of occupation numbers @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the home and passing - lane respectively .",
    "@xmath7 where zero refers to an empty site whereas one and two refer to a site being occupied by a slow or a fast car respectively .",
    "+ to investigate the characteristics of this model , a simplification has been considered .",
    "if simultaneous two - car occupation of parallel sites of the chains is forbidden , one can describe configurations with a single set of occupation numbers @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "+ inspired by the @xmath10 version of the na - sch model @xcite , we propose the following set of stochastic processes which evolve according to a random sequential updating scheme : + aa  ( with  rate   h )    bb  ( with  rate   p )    ab  ( with  rate   q )    ba  ( with  rate   r )    b a a a  ( with  rate   )    b a a b  ( with  rate  s )    in order to illustrate the above definitions , let us express their interpretations : + the first and the second of the above rules correspond to the free moving of slow and fast cars respectively .",
    "the third one expresses the accelerated movement of slow cars .",
    "this step corresponds to the so - called acceleration step in the na - sch model .",
    "the fourth rule simulates the behaviour of a driver randomly reducing his / her speed as a result of environmental effects , road conditions etc .",
    "this step corresponds to the so - called `` _ random breaking _ ''",
    "step in na - sch model .",
    "finally the last two processes simulate the behaviour of the fast - car drivers when approaching a slow car .",
    "either they pass the slow car using the passing - lane or they prefer to move behind it which give rises to their speed reduction .",
    "+ we recall that in na - sch model , the forward movement of each car is highly affected by the car ahead . here for simplicity we have considered the two - site interactions and only use three - site interaction for the passing process . in this particular case , it is crucial that the site ahead of the slow car should be empty . despite the partial explanation of microscopic rules necessary for the description of a traffic flow in a two - lane road",
    ", the present model ignores the effect of oncoming fast cars ( in the passing - lane ) on the fast car ( in the home - lane ) . in reality , a fast car attempts to overtake provided that there is enough back- space behind him in the passing - lane i.e. there is no passing car close to him in the passing - lane @xcite . in model ( i ) passing occurs locally and irrespective of the state of passing - lane behind the fast car in the home - lane .",
    "the processes ( 1 ) to ( 6 ) could be regarded as a two - species one - dimensional reaction - diffusion stochastic process .",
    "this is an example of hard - core driven lattice gas far from equilibrium which has proven to be excellent systems for theoretical investigations of low dimensional systems out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "a large variety of phenomena had already been described by driven lattice gases ( for an overview see @xcite and the references therein ) . using the rates given by ( 1 - 6 )",
    ", one can rewrite the corresponding master equation as a schrdinger - like equation in imaginary time .",
    "+ p(t ) = -h p(t )    the explicit form of @xmath11 could be written down via the rate equations .",
    "let @xmath12 @xmath13 denotes the probability that at time @xmath14 , the site @xmath15 of the chain is occupied by a slow ( fast ) car .",
    "the hamiltonian formulation of master equation allows for evaluating the average quantities in a well - established manner .",
    "it could be easily verified that the following rate equations hold for the average occupation probabilities .",
    "+ n_k , a = h n_k-1,a e_k + rn_k-1,b e_k + n_k , b n_k+1,a -hn_k , a e_k+1 -qn_k , a e_k+1    in the above equation @xmath16 stands for @xmath17 .",
    "similarly for @xmath18 we have : + n_k , b = q n_k-1,a e_k + pn_k-1,b e_k + s n_k-2,b n_k-1,ae_k -rn_k , b e_k+1 -pn_k , b",
    "e_k+1 @xmath19 + apparently the total number of neither slow nor fast cars are conserved according to the dynamics and therefore the right hand side of eqs ( 8,9 ) can not be written as a difference of two currents . however , the total number of cars i.e. the sum of slow and fast cars is a conserved quantity and the time rate of changing @xmath20 is equal to a difference between oncoming and outgoing currents . summing up eqs ( 8) and ( 9 ) yields the following discrete form of the continuity equation : + = j_k^in - j_k^out    in which the explicit form of @xmath21 is given below .",
    "+ j_k^out = hn_k , a e_k+1 + rn_k , b e_k+1 + qn_k , a e_k+1 + pn_k , b e_k+1 + sn_k , b n_k+1,a e_k+2 + equations ( 8) , ( 9 ) and ( 11 ) are valid for arbitrary time @xmath14 , however our particular interest is focused in the longtime behaviour of the system where stationarity is established . in the steady state regime , one and two - points correlators in ( 8,9 ) will be time - independent .",
    "equation ( 10 ) implies that in steady state the current would be site - independent as expected .",
    "+ so far , our result have been exact and no approximation has been implemented . at this stage and in order to solve equation ( 8 - 11 ) we resort to a mean - field approximation and replace the two point correlators with the product of one - point correlators . moreover , since the closed boundary condition has been been applied , it can be anticipated that the steady values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 be site - independent and therefore we omit the site - dependence subscripts from equations ( 8 - 11 ) . denoting the steady values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 by @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively , the steady current @xmath28 turns out to be + j=(hn_a + rn_b + qn_a + pn_b + sn_a n_b)(1-n )    in the above expression , the total density of the cars has been taken to be @xmath29 + n_a + n_b =",
    "n our final aim is to write @xmath28 in terms of total density @xmath29 and the rates .",
    "this is performed if one writes @xmath26 as a function @xmath29 and the rates . by applying the mean - field approximation to the equation ( 9 ) in its steady state form and using ( 13 ) ,",
    "one obtains the following equation + r(n - n_a)(1-n ) + ( n - n_a)n_a = qn_a(1-n ) which simply yields the solutions : + n_a = 1 the solution with the minus sign is unphysical @xmath30 so the unique solution is the one with the positive sign .",
    "we remark that within the mean - filed approach , one also can solve the time - dependent version of the equations ( 8,9 ) . in this case",
    ", the equation for @xmath31 turns out to be : + n_a = rn(1-n)- [ ( q+r)(1-n)-n ] n_a -(n_a ) ^2 which simply give rises to the following solution : + n_a ( t ) = n_a -c_1",
    "e^ c_2 ( c_3 -t ) 1- e^c_2 ( c_3 -t )    in which @xmath32 and @xmath33 are constants depending on the rates . in the long - time limit , the mean concentration of slow cars exponentially relaxes toward the steady value @xmath26 . replacing the above @xmath26 into the equation ( 13 )",
    ", one now has the total current @xmath28 as a function of @xmath29 and the rates . in order to have better insights into the problem ,",
    "extended computer simulation were carried out . here",
    "we present the result of numerical investigations of model i. in these computer simulations , the system size is typically 2400 . with no loss of generality , we re - scale the time so that the rate of hopping a fast car is set to one .",
    "the speed of slow cars is supposed to be 70 percent of the speed of the fast cars which is realized by taking @xmath34 .",
    "the values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 are set 1 and 0.7 respectively .",
    "one _ sub - update _ step consists of a random selection of a site , say @xmath37 and developing the state of the link @xmath38 according to the dynamics .",
    "one _ update _ step contains @xmath39 _ sub - updates _ .",
    "the typical number of updates developed in order that the system reaches to stationarity is 400000 and the averaging has been performed over 500000 updating steps . the initial state of the system was prepared randomly i.e. each site is occupied with the probability @xmath29 .",
    "figures below show the result of numerical simulations .",
    "the second model we consider , has less resemblance to the na - sch model .",
    "here there is no specification of fast and slow cars and only one kind of particle exists in the chain , nevertheless the distinction between fast and slow cars is realized by their appearance in the passing and home - lanes . in this periodic double - chain model",
    "the following processes occur in a random sequential updating scheme : + @xmath40 + @xmath41 + @xmath42 + @xmath43 + @xmath44 + @xmath45 + @xmath46 + @xmath47 + @xmath48 + @xmath49 + @xmath50 + @xmath51 + as depicted , the `` _ asymmetric _ '' regulation has been adopted so that the top - lane can only be used for passing . according to the above rules , once a successful passing has taken place , the passing car should return to its home - lane unless the next site in the home - lane is already occupied . in this circumstance",
    ", it can continue to pass the second slow car ( multi - passing ) .",
    "each site of the double chain takes four different states but according to the above dynamics only three of them appears in the course of time .",
    "the forbidden state is the one in which the passing - lane site is full and its parallel home - lane site is empty .",
    "regarding this fact , we characterize the three allowed states by @xmath52 and @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath53 represents the situation where both parallel sites are empty , @xmath2 represents the case of an occupied site in the home - lane and empty parallel site in passing - lane and finally @xmath3 refers to the case of both parallel sites being occupied .",

    "similar to the steps performed in model i , one can write the following form of discrete continuity equation . + = j_k^ in - j_k^ out in which + j_k^ out = hn_k , a e_k+1 + b n_k , b n_k+1,a + gn_k , b e_k+1 + an_k , a n_k+1,a + the above expression for @xmath54 has a clear interpretation in terms of rules ( 18 - 21 ) . in steady state ,",
    "the time dependences in the equation disappear and the current will be site - independent .",
    "next we apply the mean - field approximation through which all the two - point correlators are replaced by the product of one - point correlators .",
    "this leads to the following equation for @xmath28 : + j = hn_a(1-n ) + b ( n - n_a 2 ) n_a + g(n - n_a 2)(1-n ) + an_a^2 where the relation @xmath55 has been used . + in order to obtain @xmath28 in terms of total density @xmath29 and the rates , we must write @xmath26 as a function of @xmath29 and the rates . this is done by solving the following equation with its left hand side set to zero .",
