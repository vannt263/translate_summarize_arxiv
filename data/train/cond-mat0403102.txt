    "our simulations show behavior which is consistent with that predicted by scaling theories , but the concentration range we were able to investigate is not wide enough to unambiguously confirm the expected scaling behavior .",

    "the close agreement between theories for ideal polymers , and our simulations of theta polymers in the dilute regime , suggests that the effective depletion pair potentials , and associated phase behavior , should also resemble those of ideal polymers , at least in the so - called `` colloid limit '' , where @xmath182 .",
