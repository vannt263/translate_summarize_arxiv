    "since its discovery , the casimir effect has gradually become a much - discussed subject in physics .",
    "originally , one understood by the casimir effect the attractive force between two metal plates in vacuum as a result of zero - point quantum fluctuations  @xcite . nowadays",
    "the term is used for a much broader range of effects , all involving the influence of boundaries on fluctuations . as such",
    ", the casimir effect plays a role in quantum field theory , atomic and molecular physics , condensed matter physics , gravitation , cosmology and so on .",
    "a thorough review of the casimir effect in all these fields was published recently  @xcite .    for two uniformly magnetized ferromagnetic plates held parallel to each other ,",
    "it is shown in a previous paper  @xcite that the interplay of the casimir effect and the magneto - optical kerr effect gives rise to a new long - range magnetic interaction . in [ ] ,",
    "this magnetic casimir force was found to decay with interplate distance d as @xmath0 in the limit of long distances , and as @xmath1 for short distances . in this case , the ferromagnetic plates were described with a drude model and the magnetization was defined to be perpendicular to the plates . in view of future experimental investigations of this new magnetic casimir force , it would be useful to study the case where the magnetization is parallel to the plates since this situation is easier to obtain in an experimental setup .",
    "this subject will be studied in the present paper and a force which decays as @xmath2 in the long - distance limit and as @xmath3 in the limit of short distances is found when the drude model is used .",
    "this behavior is interesting since it means that the force is larger , and thus easier to measure , for in - plane magnetization than for perpendicular magnetization at sufficiently small distances .",
    "next to the drude model , another more realistic model is also studied . in this so called hybrid model ,",
    "a plasma model is used for the diagonal element of the dielectric tensor of the magnetic plates , and a single absorption line model for the off - diagonal element . as for the long distance limit",
    ", the force in this model goes like @xmath4 for the case of perpendicular magnetization and as @xmath5 when the magnetization is parallel to the plates while the behavior in the short - distance limit is unchanged .",
    "finally we will present some numerical calculations of the interaction for fe , in which experimental data for the elements of the dielectric tensor are used .",
    "an experimental setup to measure the magnetic casimir force is also discussed .",
    "consider two uniformly magnetized ferromagnetic plates of infinite lateral extension held parallel to each other .",
    "the casimir interaction energy per unit area at @xmath6 between the plates can be expressed as  @xcite :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the components of the wavevector perpendicular and parallel to the mirrors . the @xmath10 matrices @xmath11 and @xmath12 contain the reflection coefficients of the two mirrors : @xmath13 the index @xmath14 ( resp .",
    "@xmath15 ) corresponds to a polarization with the electric field perpendicular ( resp .",
    "parallel ) to the incidence plane .",
    "we will adopt here the usual convention that the @xmath14 axis remains unchanged upon reflection .",
    "since the reflection coefficients are dependent on the direction of the magnetisation of the mirrors , it is clear from eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and  ( [ eq2 ] ) that the magnetic casimir energy between the mirrors will differ for the situations in which the magnetizations of the two mirrors are parallel ( fm ) or antiparallel ( af ) .",

    "when the magnetisation direction is reversed , these terms will change sign .",
    "since the first order terms are usually much smaller than 1 and than the terms that are independent of q , it is possible to expand expression  ( [ eq3 ] ) to lowest order in the linear terms .",

    "the power laws differ ( except for the in - plane configuration at short distances ) from those obtained for the drude and hybrid model .",

    "a possible mrfm setup is already discussed in detail in ref .",
    "a thin film ( @xmath133  10  nm ) of ferromagnetic material with hard magnetization is deposited on a substrate which is placed on a piezo - electric actuator .",
    "the lens - shaped mirror is attached to a cantilever by first depositing a small droplet of polymer on the cantilever , which can then be covered by evaporation with a thin ( @xmath133  10  nm ) layer of soft ferromagnet ( such as permalloy ) . in this way ,",

    "the deflection of the cantilever can then be measured with a laser . in this way",
    ", the magnetic force ( @xmath135 ) can be measured .",
    "the force resolution achievable using a freely vibrating cantilever is fundamentally limited by intrinsic thermomechanical noise .",
    "this force noise can be controlled by the geometry of the cantilever ; one needs a high q cantilever that is thin , narrow and long to obtain the best sensitivity . with ultrathin silicon cantilevers , force resolutions in the attonewton range",
    "have been obtained  @xcite .",
    "more information on the sensitivity of mrfm can be found in  [ ] .",
    "since the non - magnetic casimir effect is independent of the magnetization direction of the samples , only the magnetic contribution to the casimir effect will be measured by using this modulation technique .",
    "parasitic electrostatic forces ( caused by a difference in potential between the magnetic samples ) are also taken care of automatically in this way .",
    "the exchange interaction between the samples does not contribute much at the separations of interest ( @xmath136  nm ) .",
    "another parasitic magnetostatic interaction is the dipole interaction between the ferromagnets .",
    "this dipole force can be made as small as needed by taking a ferromagnetic plate with sufficiently large lateral extension and sufficiently small thickness .",
    "the plate should also be as uniformly magnetized as possible . with a plate of radius 1  cm , and a thickness of 10  nm",
    ", this parasitic magnetostatic force can be estimated to be below 1  attonewton .",
    "interaction of the soft sample with the ac magnetic field will yield a signal at two times the modulation frequency , so this can be filtered out effectively by using a lock - in amplifier . thus with mrfm , it should be possible to measure the magnetic casimir interaction without much influence of other effects .",
    "in this paper , the magnetic casimir interaction discovered in  [ ] was generalized to the case where the magnetization is parallel to the plates .",
    "the calculations for the drude model in the short - distance limit were revised , and another model was introduced .",
    "the behavior of the interaction was discussed in the different distance regimes , and it is seen that the interaction in the two models decays quite different with interplate distance .",
    "numerical calculations for a real system with iron plates were also presented .",
    "here we used experimental data for the dielectric tensor of the mirrors .",
    "the results from this numerical work on fe could not be fitted by one of the introduced models , because interband transitions play a prominent role in fe , and these were not implemented correctly in the models .",
    "+ it was made acceptable that the new casimir magnetic interaction can be measured with magnetic resonance force microscopy .",
    "however , to obtain an accurate comparison of the theory with eventual experimental results , more work is needed on the theoretical side .",
    "a detailed analysis of the geometrical effects would be valuable ; the proximity force theorem does not provide reliable estimations at a level of accuracy of a few percent .",
    "also one has to consider other corrections already calculated for the non - magnetic casimir effect ; e.g. surface roughness corrections would probably play an important role  @xcite .",
    "finally , more experimental data on the off - diagonal element of the dielectric tensor for several ferromagnetic materials is also necessary in order to obtain a better estimate of the magnitude of the interaction from the numerical procedure presented .",

    "<S> the casimir effect results from alterations of the zero - point electromagnetic energy introduced by boundary - conditions . for ferromagnetic layers separated by vacuum ( or a dielectric ) </S>",
    "<S> such boundary - conditions are influenced by the magneto - optical kerr effect . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that this gives rise to a long - range magnetic interaction and discuss the effect for two different configurations ( magnetization parallel and perpendicular to the layers ) . </S>",
    "<S> analytical expressions are derived for two models and compared to numerical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> numerical calculations of the effect for fe are also presented and the possibility of an experimental observation of the casimir magnetic interaction is discussed . </S>"
