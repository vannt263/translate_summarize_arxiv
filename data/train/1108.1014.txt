    "variable stars are useful tools to improve our understanding on stellar evolution and structure of stars .",
    "star clusters are unique laboratories to study the stellar evolution as star clusters provide a sample of stars having same age , distance , initial composition and spanning range of masses .",
    "additionally , the light curves of several stars can be produced simultaneously to know the real variable stars among them .",
    "studies of variable stars in star clusters are carried out since several years ( herbst et al .",
    "1994 ; edwards et al . 1993 ; oliveira & casali 2008 ; grankin et al .",
    "star clusters have different types of variable stars as stars show variability at various stages of their evolutionary phases .    in the present study",
    ", we made a search for variable stars in an extremely young open cluster berkeley 59 ( be 59 ) .",
    "be 59 is a young cluster and it contains a significant numbers of pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars i.e , stars evolving from their birthline to the main - sequence ( ms ) .",
    "this cluster ( @xmath6 = 00@xmath7 02@xmath8 13@xmath9 , @xmath10 = + 67@xmath11 25@xmath12 11@xmath13 , l = 118@xmath11.22 , b = 5@xmath11.00 ) is located at the centre of ob4 stellar association surrounded by hii region , sharpless region s171 ( yang & fukui 1992 ) .",
    "previous studies have revealed that be 59 consists of many pms stars having age around 2 myr ( pandey et al .",
    "be 59 was first studied photographically by blanco & williams ( 1959 ) .",
    "they concluded that stars of spectral types o7 to b5 are still surrounded by a part of the parent molecular cloud .",
    "a multiwavelength study on be 59 was presented by pandey et al .",
    "( 2008 , hereafter p08 ) .",
    "they found that this cluster is located at a distance of 1.0 kpc and having a variable extinction of @xmath14=1.4 - 1.8 mag .",
    "they also found that around 32% of the h@xmath15 emission stars in be 59 exhibit nir excess indicating that they still have their inner disk . during a campaign of photometric monitoring , majaess et al .",
    "( 2008 ) presented the nature of the three eclipsing systems ( bd+66@xmath111673 , 2mass 00104558 + 6127556 and 2msass 19064659 + 4401458 ) in the field of be 59 using @xmath16 photometry and spectroscopic observations . from the above studies it is clear that be 59 contains high , intermediate and low mass pms stars .",
    "pms objects are , in general , classified into t tauri stars ( ttss ) and herbig ae / be stars",
    ". the ttss are newly formed low - mass stars ( @xmath173m@xmath18 ) which are contracting towards the ms ( herbig 1977 ) , while stars of intermediate mass ( @xmath193 - 10 m@xmath20 ) are known as herbig ae / be stars ( herbig 1960 ; finkenzeller & mundt 1984 ; strom et al .",
    "ae / be stars are either contracting towards ms or they have reached the ms .",
    "the ttss can be classified further as weak line ttss ( wttss ) and classical ttss ( cttss ) on the basis of the strength of the h@xmath15 emission lines ( strom et al .",
    "the strength of the emission line is measured by its equivalent width ( ew ) . the wttss exhibit a weak , narrow h@xmath21 ( ew@xmath22 ) in emission with no or little infrared excess , while cttss generally display strong h@xmath15 emission line ( ew@xmath2310@xmath24 ) , large ultraviolet and infrared excess . the large h@xmath21 emission ( ew@xmath2310@xmath24 )",
    "is believed to be a result of the increased mass accretion onto the star ( e.g. cabrit et al .",
    "1990 ; calvet & hartmann 1992 ) .",
    "it is found that pms stars show strong variability both in photometric and spectroscopic ( van den ancker et al . 1998 ; catala et al .",
    "1999 ) observations .",
    "this could be due to the presence of circumstellar obscuration and spots present on the photosphere .",
    "in fact variability is a defining characteristics of ttss ( herbst et al .",
    "1994 ; scholz et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) .",
    "both wttss and cttss show variation in their brightness .",
    "these variations are found to occur at all wavelengths , from x - ray to infrared .",
    "variability time scale of ttss ranges from few minutes to years ( appenzeller & mundt 1989 ) . the photometric variations are believed to originate from several mechanisms like circumstellar gas and dust ( remnant of parent molecular cloud ) , accretion and magnetic field ( herbst et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the variations in the brightness of ttss are most probably due to the presence of spots ( cool or hot ) at stellar surface and circumstellar disk .",
    "the cool spots on the surface of the stars are produced by the emergence of stellar magnetic fields on the photosphere , and is thus an indicator of magnetic activity .",
    "as these spots are present on the photosphere , they rotate with the star .",
    "if these spots are symmetrically distributed over the photosphere , periodic variations are seen in the light curves of the stars .",
    "spot configurations remain constant over time - scales of several days , but undergo changes on time - scales of weeks ( hussain 2002 ) .",
    "the cool spots on the photosphere of star are responsible for brightness variation in wttss , and these objects are found to be fast rotators as they have either thin or no circumstellar disk . therefore the variability in these objects may be mainly due to the brightness variations on the photosphere modulated by the stellar rotation ( messina et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the hot spots on the surface of young stars are supposed to be formed on the surface by infalling gas and are thus a direct consequence of accretion ( lynden - bell & pringle 1974 ; koenigl 1991 ; shu et al .",
    "irregular or non periodic variations are produced because of changes in the accretion rate .",
    "the time scales of varying brightness range from hours to years .",
    "the hot spots cover a smaller fraction of the stellar surface but higher temperature causes larger brightness variations ( carpenter et al .",
    "thus , accreting cttss which are surrounded by circumstellar accretion disk and possess hot spots produced by accreting material from disk on to the star show complex behaviour in their optical and near infrared ( nir ) light curves ( scholz et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "ae / be stars also show variability as they move across the instability region in the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram on their way to the ms .",
    "the right combination of mass , temperature and luminosity of these stars make them to pulsate .",
    "several pms pulsators have been detected until now ( breger 1972 ; kurtz & marang 1995 ; marconi et al . 2000 ; donati et al .",
    "1997 ; zwintz et al .",
    "2005 , 2009 ; zwintz & weiss 2006 ) .",
    "catala ( 2003 ) presented detailed review on the pms pulsations and expected that pms stars could pulsate as @xmath25 scuti stars , however it is necessary to confirm their pms nature because these stars are found above the ms where it is very difficult to say whether they are pms or post ms stars .",
    "but in cluster environment where the age of the cluster is constrained well , the stars found towards the cluster region could be pms stars .",
    "a search of photometric variables in young open cluster be 59 , which is found to have a rich population of pms stars with a large mass range could give us a better insight of the variability time - scales , the amplitude of brightness variation etc . with this aim",
    ", we observed the cluster be 59 at different epochs from 2006 to 2010 .",
    "the paper is organised in the following manner . in section 2 , we describe the observations and data reduction techniques .",
    "we discuss membership of variable stars on the basis of photometric observations in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we determine periods of variable stars .",
    "we discuss variability characteristics as well as period and amplitude distribution of variable stars in section 5 , while in section 6 we conclude our studies .",

    "the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the cluster region clearly reveals contamination due to field star population ( cf .",

    "they also identified a foreground field star population at a distance of @xmath3470 pc with a @xmath14=0.40 mag ( cf .",

    "it is worthwhile to point that majority of the field stars ( 10 out of 11 ) are located outside the core ( 1.4 arcmin , p08 ) of the cluster .    in order to determine the ages and masses of the probable pms variable stars we have used pms isochrones and evolutionary tracks by siess et al .",

    "the extinction ratios @xmath35 and @xmath36 have been adopted from cohen et al .",

    ". however , there seems segregation of sources between @xmath37 @xmath19 1.0 mag and @xmath38 @xmath19 0.50 mag in @xmath2 colour - colour diagram . as discussed above that class ii sources with small amount of nir excess could be found in ` f ' region near the middle reddening vector .",

    "the membership of the variable stars is determined on the basis of their location in @xmath1 cmd and nir ccd .",
    "however , spectroscopic follow up of these objects is needed to confirm their nature .",
    "we used the lomb - scargle ( ls ) periodogram ( lomb 1976 ; scargle 1982 ) to determine the most likely period of a variable star .",
    "the ls method is useful for finding significant periodicities even with unevenly sampled data .",
    "we used the algorithm publicly available at the starlink software database , and verified the periods further with the software period04 ( lenz & breger 2005 ) .",

    "are believed to occur due to the axial rotation of a star with an inhomogeneous surface , having either hot or cool spots ( herbst et al .",
    "1987 , 1994 ) .",
    "herbst et al . ( 1994 ) identified three types of tt variables based on their variability timescales ranging from a day to weeks .",
    "type i variability , most often seen in wttss , is characterized by smaller stellar flux variations ( a few times of 0.1 mag ) and results from the rotation of a cool spotted photosphere .",
    "type ii variations have larger brightness variations ( up to @xmath32 mag ) , most often irregular but sometime periodic , are associated with short - lived accretion related hot spots at the stellar surface of cttss .",
    "the rare type iii variations are characterized by luminosity dips lasting from a few days upto several months , which presumably result from circumstellar dust obscuration .",
    "the sample of ttss in the cluster be 59 indicates that @xmath390% ttss have periods less than 15 days .",
    "the estimated periods of 8 cttss vary in the range of 0.652 day to 10.317 day , however stars v3 and v10 have significantly larger periods ( 89.8 day and 58.7 day respectively ) .",
    "the period estimates for wttss vary from 0.109 day to 5.671 day , however @xmath395% wttss have periods @xmath41 2 day . the shorter periods in the case of wttss could be explained as most of the stars at this age might have unlocked from their disks while contracting towards ms .",
    "they spin up because of decreasing radii in order to conserve their angular momentum ( strom et al .",

    "( 2006 ) have different view and suggest that environment also plays a crucial role in establishing the rotation periods besides age and mass .",
    "the presence of ` o ' type stars in the vicinity would speed up the process of the dispersal of the circumstellar disks causing the stars to spin up at a much younger age .",
    "the amplitude of wttss ranges from 0.022 to 0.273 mag .",
    "the amplitude in the case of cttss has a range of 0.215 to 1.122 mag .",

    "( 2007 for cttss ) .",
    "the brightness of cttss is found to vary with larger amplitude in comparison to the wttss .",
    "the large amplitude in the case of cttss indicates presence of the hot spots on their surfaces .",
    "the smaller amplitude in the case of wttss suggests that these pms stars might be in the process of dissipation of their circumstellar disk .",
    "the star v3 , a probable ctts , seems to be an interesting object .",
    "it has relatively high excess ( @xmath42 ) and shows relatively high extinction ( cf .",
    "it has a period of 89.80 days with amplitude variation of 1.0 mag and its mass is estimated to be @xmath30.9 @xmath4 .",
    "the relatively high extinction of this object could be due to the presence of the circumstellar disk .",
    "edwards et al .",
    "( 1993 ) found that the stars which showed the evidence of circumstellar disks , inferred from their @xmath38 colours , are slow rotators in comparison to those that lacked circumstellar disks .",
    "relatively high extinction and longer period of v3 support this argument .",
    "this star may belong to type iii as classified by herbst et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , where relatively larger luminosity dips for longer period are expected due to circumstellar dust obscuration .",
    "the h@xmath21 emission star v10 , classified as ctts , also seems to be an interesting object .",
    "a careful inspection of night to night observations of this star reveals amplitude variation .",
    "its 2006 observations show that the brightness of this star was varying with larger amplitude ( 1.122 mag ) and period 1.102 day . from 2007 and",
    "onwards , it shows consistent brightness variation with amplitude of @xmath30.20 mag and period of 1.102 day . whereas , the whole data set yield a period of 58.753 day .",
    "star v19 ( ( @xmath43 mag ) could be a pms pulsating star as suggested by its variability characteristics like period , amplitude and the shape of light curve .",
    "the period and amplitude of star v19 vary over time .",
    "its period on 11 october 2009 and 27 october 2010 is found to be 0.101 day and 0.096 day , respectively , whereas its amplitude varied from 0.022 to 0.014 mag on respective dates .",
    "considering all the observations of this star its period comes out be 0.109 day .",
    "star v19 might be a @xmath25 scuti type variable star .",
    "an early type star v23 ( brightest star in the present sample ) , considered to be a member of the cluster , might be a pulsating star .",
    "its period ( 0.217 day ) and amplitude ( 0.027 mag ) are very much similar to the b - type pulsating stars .",
    "star v21 , lying just below the ms , could be a cluster member .",
    "the period , amplitude and the shape of light curve of v21 suggest that it might be a pulsating star .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of star v21 was made by majaess et al .",

    "the field variables have period @xmath5 1.16 days and amplitude @xmath5 0.30 mag .      in order to study the correlation between stellar activity and mass / age , we plot rotation period as a function of mass / age in fig",

    "2006 , herbst et al .",
    "the presence of nir excess in @xmath38 of v3 and h@xmath21 emission in case of v10 is probably indicative of disk locking .",
    "but it is worth to mention here that large ir excess alone could not indicate ongoing disk - locking because ir excess is the indicator for the presence of circumstellar dust and it is not an indicator for current mass accretion ( lamm et al .",
    "2005 ) .    fig .",
    "12 ( left panel ) and fig .",
    "12 ( right panel ) show amplitude as function of mass and age , respectively .",
    "12 ( left panel ) reveals that the amplitude of ttss seems to be correlated with the mass of the star in the sense that amplitude decreases with increasing mass of the variables .",
    "the largest amplitude is found in the case of v3 ( 0.855 mag ) and v10 ( 1.122 mag ) .",
    "the star v3 shows significantly higher @xmath38 excess with relatively larger extinction , whereas star v10 shows h@xmath21 emission .",
    "thus both the stars manifest presence of disk .",
    "the decrease in amplitude could be due to the dispersal of the disk material .",
    "if this notion is true , it indicates that the mechanism for disk dispersal operates less efficiently for relatively low mass stars .",
    "in fact there is evidence in literature that disk dispersal mechanism depends on the mass of the stars ( e.g. carpenter et al .",
    "but in fig 12 .",
    "( right panel ) , the amplitude variation with ages shows no definite trend , and majority of the sources having the ages within 5 myrs show the amplitude of variability up to 0.35 mag with two cttss as exception , which have been discussed earlier .",
