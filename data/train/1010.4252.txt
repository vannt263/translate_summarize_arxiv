    "the construction in the present paper was motivated by a joint work with peter ozsvth on the heegaard floer homology of double branched covers . in @xcite",
    "a spectral sequence is constructed from the reduced khovanov homology of a link @xmath1 to the hat version of heegaard floer homology @xmath2 with @xmath0 coefficients , where @xmath3 denotes the double cover of @xmath4 branched along @xmath1 .",
    "the same construction also gives a spectral sequence from the mod 2 khovanov homology @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "( note that the latter is just two copies of @xmath2 . )",
    "gauge - theoretic spectral sequences starting from khovanov homology were constructed by bloom @xcite for monopole floer homology @xcite , and by kronheimer and mrowka @xcite in the context of instanton floer homology .",
    "it was proved by baldwin in @xcite that the heegaard floer homology spectral sequence is a link invariant . the corresponding result for the monopole floer homology sequence",
    "was given in @xcite .",
    "given an @xmath7-crossing diagram @xmath8 of a link @xmath1 the constructions in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite assign higher differentials for the mod 2 khovanov complex that correspond to @xmath9-dimensional faces of @xmath10 , with @xmath11 .",
    "note that the differentials count solutions to the seiberg - witten equations for certain @xmath12 dimensional family of metrics in @xcite , instantons in @xcite , and certain pseudo holomorphic @xmath13-gons in @xcite .",
    "in particular the maps for a given hypercube depend on some additional data , such as choices of metric and perturbations , or heegaard diagrams and complex structures .",
    "the construction in the present paper uses the same idea .",
    "however the extra data is more combinatorial : at each crossing we will fix an orientation of the arc that connects the two segments of the @xmath14-resolution , see figure [ skein ] .",
    "this overall choice @xmath15 is called a decoration of the diagram .",
    "given a decoration , each @xmath9 dimensional face determines a collection of circles in the two - dimensional plane together with @xmath9 oriented arcs that connect the circles .",
    "these configurations are discussed in section @xmath16 . in sections",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 we spell out a geometric rule that assigns non - trivial contributions to certain special configurations , see for example figure [ 2d ] and [ abcde ] . in section",
    "@xmath19 we prove that @xmath20 , and so we get a chain complex @xmath21 for a decorated diagram @xmath22 .",
    "another feature of the constrution is that the higher differentials preserve the @xmath23 grading in khovanov homology , and that induces a @xmath23 grading on the homology @xmath24 .",
    "see also @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for discussions on extra gradings in heegaard floer homology .",
    "there is also a filtration on @xmath25 , given by the homological grading , and that gives a spectral sequence from @xmath5 to @xmath24 .",
    "in section 6 we prove that the homology theory @xmath26 and the spectral sequence are well - defined invariants of @xmath1 :    given an oriented link @xmath1 , let @xmath27 , @xmath28 be two diagrams representing @xmath1 , and let @xmath29 , @xmath30 be decorations for @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively .",
    "then there is a grading preserving isomorpism between @xmath31 and @xmath32 . furthermore the spectral sequences @xmath33 and @xmath34 are also isomorphic .",
    "while the definitions of @xmath35 and @xmath36 use different tools , the two homology theories are rather similar .",
    "in fact it is natural to conjecture that the two homology theories are isomorphic as mod 2 graded vector spaces over @xmath37 .",
    "the similarities are underscored by a few additional constructions , presented in section 7 .",
    "these include a reduced version of @xmath38 that could be the natural counterpart of @xmath39 , and an adaptation of the transverse invariant of @xcite to @xmath38 , see also @xcite , @xcite .",
    "computations for the spectral sequence are given in a recent work of seed , see @xcite .",
    "while in this paper we work over mod 2 coefficients , an integer lift of the spectral sequence for odd khovanov homology is given in @xcite . in a different direction",
    "it would be interesting to compare @xmath38 with the recent work of lipshitz , ozsvth and thurston , see @xcite    * acknowledgment .",
    "* i would like to thank john baldwin , peter ozsvth , cotton seed and andrs stipsicz for many helpful conversations during the course of this work .",
    "we will start by recalling some constructions from khovanov homology , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 be an oriented link , and @xmath8 be a diagram of @xmath1 in the plane with @xmath7 crossings .",
    "at each crossing we have two resolutions @xmath14 and @xmath40 , see figure [ skein ] .",
    "sometimes it will be helpful to use the one - point compactification of the plane and view @xmath8 and the resolutions in the 2-dimensional sphere .    by ordering the crossings we get an identification between the set of resolutions @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "each resolution @xmath43 gives a set of disjoint circles @xmath44 in the sphere .",
    "the resolution @xmath45 comes equipped with a @xmath46 dimensional vector space @xmath47 over @xmath0 .",
    "it will be useful for us to identify the basis of @xmath47 with monomials in @xmath48 .",
    "this is done by associating a two dimensional vector space @xmath49 for each circle with generators @xmath40 and @xmath48 , and defining @xmath47 as the tensor product of @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "note that the original construction of khovanov @xcite , @xcite uses different notations , where @xmath51 plays the role of @xmath48 , and @xmath52 the role of @xmath40 .",
    "finally we define @xmath53    a @xmath9 dimensional face of @xmath54 corresponds @xmath55 with @xmath56 so that @xmath45 and @xmath57 differs at exactly @xmath9 coordinates . in khovanov homology",
    "the boundary map is defined by associating maps @xmath58 to all the 1-dimensional faces ( edges ) of @xmath41 .",
    "our goal is to define some higher differentials on @xmath59 by extending the definition of @xmath60 to all @xmath9 dimensional faces . to this end",
    "we will need to fix some extra data ( decoration ) at each crossing .",
    "first note that at each crossing there is an arc connecting the two segments of the @xmath14 resolution . making surgery along",
    "this arc produces the @xmath40 resolution .",
    "the extra data is an assignment of orientation to all of these arcs . the oriented arc at the @xmath61-th crossing is denoted by @xmath62 .",
    "at each crossing there are two choices .",
    "let @xmath15 denote an overall decoration for @xmath8 .",
    "a decorated @xmath9-dimensional face @xmath63 of @xmath22 determines a configuration in the sphere , that consist of the circles of @xmath45 together with @xmath9 oriented arcs @xmath64 , where @xmath65 are the coordinates where @xmath45 and @xmath57 differ .",
    "sometimes it will be useful to have a more abstract notion of this configuration , that makes no reference to the knot projection @xmath8 .",

    "however all the oriented arcs are pointed to the right , so there are no type @xmath226 configurations that emanate from this resolution .",
    "now we have to study braid moves as in @xcite , and see that the distinguished element maps to each other .",
