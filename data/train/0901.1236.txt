    "we omit the tilde and then the dimensionless hamiltonian reads @xmath14 the schrdinger equation of a periodically driven quantum system has according to the floquet theorem solutions of the form @xmath15 , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 the period of the driving .",
    "the time - periodic parts @xmath18 of the floquet states form a complete orthonormal set at all times .",

    "the coupling to a heat bath is modeled in a standard way by a hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath21 the bath hamiltonian @xmath22 describes an ensemble of noninteracting harmonic oscillators coupled via @xmath23 to the system .",
    "the properties of the system - bath coupling are given in terms of the spectral density of the bath @xmath24 $ ] . in the continuum limit the spectral density",
    "is assumed to be a smooth function which is linear for an ohmic bath .",
    "an exponential cutoff beyond the spectral mode @xmath25 leads to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is proportional to the classical damping coefficient .    in the presence of the heat bath the state of the system",

    "its equation of motion for time - periodic quantum systems has been derived within the floquet - markov approach  @xcite : herein the floquet formalism ensures a non - perturbative treatment of the driven systems coherent dynamics .",
    "the coupling to the heat bath is treated perturbatively , which is valid in the limit of weak coupling between the driven system and the bath .",
    "this approximation requires a rapid decay of bath correlations compared to the typical relaxation time of the system and we further require @xmath29 . in the following",
    "we restrict the discussion to the limit of large times , larger than the relaxation time . in this limit",
    "the density matrix @xmath30 in the basis of the periodic parts @xmath18 of the floquet states is approximated as time - independent  @xcite .",

    "we get a first insight into this dramatic phenomenon from figs .",
    "[ fig : bild2](a ) and ( b ) , where one can see that under the variation of the driving amplitude @xmath7 the quasienergy spectrum shows around @xmath44 an isolated avoided crossing of the states 2 and 7 originating from the second and the 7th excited state of the undriven system .",
    "we emphasize , that both the ground state , which is dominantly populated at @xmath2 , and the first excited state , which will turn out to be dominantly populated at @xmath4 , are not involved in this avoided crossing .",
    "an intuitive understanding of the switching from the rate equation seems impossible : tuning through an avoided crossing of the two floquet states 2 and 7 they exchange their character and thus drastically affect in eq .   a large number of rates @xmath54 , where one of the four indices is 2 or 7 .",
    "in order to visualize the changes of the density operator due to this avoided crossing it is convenient to express this operator in a basis that does not significantly change in the neighborhood of the avoided crossing . in the subspace of the floquet states of the avoided crossing we use the diabatic states 2 and 7 , which would correspond to an exact crossing . due to the weak driving amplitude",

    "[ fig : bild2](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "one observes that @xmath56 , which corresponds to being in the ground state of the undriven system , drops from close to one to almost zero for @xmath44 .",

    "the tiny occupations @xmath58 and @xmath59 , i.e.  the probabilities to be in one of the states of the avoided crossing , become equal .",
    "these observations for @xmath46 are consistent with the spatial probability density observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : bild1](c ) and can indeed be exploited for a switching between the wells : tuning the driving amplitude from outside the avoided crossing into its center is accompanied by a probability transfer from the former ground state in the left well to the first excited state localized in the right well .",
    "while the equality @xmath60 at the center of an avoided crossing of states 2 and 7 is quite plausible , the main question is still unanswered : how can states 0 and 1 , which are not involved in the avoided crossing , interchange their probability ?      we will answer the above question by using an effective approximate rate system introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is derived from eq .  , @xmath61 for the diagonal elements @xmath46 in the diabatic basis with an additional rate @xmath62 replacing the rates @xmath63 , @xmath64 in eq .   due to",
    "the single isolated avoided crossing of diabatic states 2 and 7 .",
    "before we make use of these equations , we make a number of remarks : the rates @xmath65 are expressed in the diabatic basis .",
    "the rate @xmath66 with @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) describes the transitions from the states of the avoided crossing to all other states .",
    "it is proportional to @xmath27 with a factor that is specific to an individual avoided crossing .",
    "the rate @xmath47 depends on the minimal splitting @xmath69 of the avoided crossing and the dimensionless distance @xmath70 from the avoided crossing .",
    "the main assumptions used in the derivation  @xcite is that all quasienergy splittings @xmath71 , apart from the isolated avoided crossing of interest , are much larger than the rates @xmath54 .",
    "this is fulfilled for a sufficiently weak coupling to the heat bath and allows for neglecting almost all off - diagonal density matrix elements .",
    "the only non - negligible off - diagonal elements are @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which are decoupled from eq .   and proportional to @xmath74 .",
    "the dotted lines in figs .",
    "[ fig : bild2](b ) demonstrate this approximation .    the main advantage of the effective rate system in the diabatic basis , eq .",

    ", it is much larger than all other rates .",
    "this leads directly to almost equal occupations of the diabatic states involved in the avoided crossing , @xmath60 .",
    "we explain the dominant occupation of state 1 as the combined result of the following facts : ( i ) the overall stationary probability flux between any two states is in general nonzero , as detailed balance is broken by the periodic driving .",
    "( ii ) the rates between neighboring states localized in the same well are much larger than other intra - well rates as well as inter - well rates ( due to the small spatial overlap between the states of different wells ) . therefore , among the states confined to the same well detailed balance approximately holds true , e.g.  between state 0 and 2 or state 1 and 3 .",
    "( iii ) @xmath47 is the dominant rate and induces occupation equality of states 2 and 7 .",
    "figure [ fig : bild2](c ) shows the resulting depopulation of state 2 towards state 7 .",
    "( iv ) due to the approximate detailed balance among the states in the left well the relative occupation of state 0 and 2 remains constant and therefore @xmath56 drops down together with @xmath58 .",
    "( v ) the states in the right well equilibrate as before but with increased weights due to probability conservation .",

    "this quantity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bild3](a ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : bild3](b ) demonstrates that if the coupling to the heat bath is larger than the minimal splitting of the avoided crossing , @xmath84 , almost no probability is switched to the right well .",
    "( note , that even for the largest values of @xmath85 in fig .",

    "this is due to the fact that in this limit @xmath47 becomes negligible compared to the other rates and thus the influence of the avoided crossing vanishes  @xcite . in contrast , for small coupling @xmath86 we have a high switching efficiency and one can show that it is independent of @xmath85 in the limit @xmath87 .",
    "figure  [ fig : bild3](c ) shows the influence of the temperature @xmath40 , which can be related to the level spacing @xmath88 of the undriven system . at high temperatures , @xmath89 , the floquet states are almost equally occupied resulting in @xmath90 . for temperatures @xmath91",

    "we explain this switching mechanism by an effective rate equation at the avoided crossing .",
    "we now briefly discuss possible advantages of the switching mechanism in applications : ( i ) if one uses a laser for the periodic driving , the amplitude dependence of the switching mechanism and the beam profile allow switching at a 3d spatially localized position with a resolution smaller than the focus width .",
    "( ii ) in situations where a theoretical modeling of the system , e.g.  a complex molecule , is not achievable and no other switching mechanism is known , the generic appearance of avoided crossings in time - periodically driven systems suggests the existence of driving parameters for the desired switching .",
    "we emphasize that this switching mechanism is completely different from standard techniques which allow to transfer a wave packet from one well to the other by resonant or near resonant driving and negligible coupling to a heat bath .",
    "there one has to prepare a specific initial wave packet and has to apply the driving for a specific duration .",
    "in contrast , here the initial state of the system is arbitrary , the duration of the driving is arbitrary ( if larger than the relaxation time ) , and the presence of the heat bath is essential .",
