    "the wireless information transfer ( wit ) and wireless power transfer ( wpt ) technologies share the common origin of the electromagnetic waves , which is a direct consequence of the fact that radio frequency ( rf ) signals carry energy as well as information at the same time . nevertheless , prior research activities and industrial developments on wit have been carried out independently from those on wpt , due to the fact that wit and wpt operate with rather different receiver power sensitivities , i.e. , @xmath2 dbm for information receivers and @xmath3 dbm for energy receivers @xcite . as a result , wit and wpt have distinct receiver architectures and design objectives . in particular",
    ", wit makes use of the _ active _",
    "mixer for maximal information delivery rate @xcite , whereas wpt utilizes the _ passive _ rectenna for maximal energy transmission efficiency @xcite .",
    "it is not until recently that the dual use of rf signals for _ simultaneous wireless information and power transfer _ ( swipt ) @xcite has been studied , giving rise to an appealing solution for energy - constrained wireless systems such as cooperative relay networks .",
    "recent advances on swipt have demonstrated conflicting objectives in designing wit for maximal information delivery rate and wpt for maximal energy transmission efficiency , as witnessed by the fundamental _ rate - energy tradeoff _ @xcite .",
    "varshney first introduced the notion of the rate - energy region for swipt in additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channels @xcite , which was then generalized to frequency - selective fading channels @xcite .",
    "these pioneering studies , however , were based on an ideal receiver circuit which simultaneously decodes information and harvests energy from the same signal without any loss @xcite .",
    "it has been recognized that this ideal receiver architecture @xcite may be difficult to implement given the current state - of - the - art of electronic circuits .",
    "a practical receiver architecture incorporating both energy harvesting ( eh ) and information decoding ( i d ) circuits into a single terminal was proposed in @xcite . based on this practical architecture",
    ", the wireless terminal may operate either in the time switching mode @xcite , in which the receiver perform eh and i d in a time - division fashion , or in the power splitting mode @xcite , in which the receiver splits the received signal into two streams for separate eh and i d at the same time .",
    "the corresponding rate - energy tradeoff was studied for single - input single - output ( siso ) @xcite and multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) channels @xcite .",
    "the power allocation , beamforming design , and optimization schemes were studied to achieve various tradeoffs between eh and i d .",
    "the throughput maximization for a multi - user system was addressed in @xcite .",
    "the optimum power allocation maximizing the information rate while guaranteeing that the harvested energy is above a threshold was studied for broadband systems where perfect instantaneous channel state information ( csi ) was available at the transmitter @xcite .",
    "moreover , beamforming scheme maximizing the harvested energy subject to information rate constraint was studied under imperfect csi in @xcite .",
    "similarly , beamforming design maximizing the information rate subject to eh constraint was addressed in @xcite .",
    "the precoder maximizing the energy efficiency in mimo wiretap channel subject to secrecy rate and power constraints was studied in @xcite .",
    "these works @xcite represent typical applications of swipt in point - to - point ( p2p ) communications .",
    "recently , the swipt has also found its application in energy - constrained wireless relay networks . in eh relay systems ,",
    "the source and destination typically have dedicated power supplies from battery or power grid , while the relays are powered by the rf signals radiated by the source .",
    "the throughput performance of an amplify - and - forward ( af ) relay network employing eh relays was studied for both delay - limited and delay - tolerant applications in @xcite .",
    "the benefits of eh relays and the differences between eh relay networks and conventional relay networks were investigated in @xcite . in @xcite , a joint power allocation and relay selection scheme for af",
    "relay networks with eh ability was studied . a greedy switching strategy between eh and data relaying",
    "was investigated for a dual - hop af network , and the outage probability was analyzed in @xcite . besides af relay systems",
    ", swipt has also been studied for decode - and - forward ( df ) relay systems .",
    "specifically , a df network consisting of multiple source - destination pairs and one eh relay was studied in @xcite , where the outage probability was studied taking into account the spatial randomness of the source - destination pairs .",
    "for the same system , the diversity performance and power allocation were studied in @xcite .",
    "similarly , a df eh network consisting of one or multiple sources , multiple relays , and one destination was studied in @xcite , and a more general df system consisting of a multiple source - destination pairs and multiple eh relays in the presence of random interferences was studied in @xcite , where the small - scale fading and the large - scale path - loss were taken into account in the outage probability analysis .      due to the far - field isotropic rf radiation , the energy transfer efficiency of wpt ( e.g. , microwave power transfer ) via rf signals is very low .",
    "beamforming techniques ( based on large antenna arrays ) can substantially boost the energy efficiency by forming focused energy beams using the instantaneous csi .",
    "the existing works @xcite on swipt have either explicitly or implicitly assumed _ coherent _ wit which requires the instantaneous csi for information decoding . for eh relay systems featuring coherent wit , the source needs to periodically send training symbols for channel estimation , which results in an increased network signaling overhead .",
    "moreover , sophisticated channel estimation algorithm needs to be implemented in a _ distributed _ manner among spatially separated wireless terminals , which inevitably increases the hardware complexity and results in extra energy consumption .",
    "the consumed energy due to channel estimation and training becomes a serious issue especially for eh relay systems , as the consumed power reduces the net harvested energy for future data relaying .",
    "therefore , _ coherent _ swipt requiring channel estimation might be a costly approach for energy - constrained applications .",
    "as a remedy , the _ noncoherent _ swipt which eliminates the need for training signalings and the channel estimation , and consequently , consumes much less energy , might be an energy - efficient and cost - effective solution for eh relay systems .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , however , the _ noncoherent _ swipt has not been studied in the literature , which motivated this work .",
    "the existing works on swipt have been devoted to the _ information - theoretic _ performance analysis in terms of the rate - energy tradeoff , ergodic capacity , outage probability , etc .",
    "however , insights into the swipt regarding the bit or symbol error rate performance associated with an actual detection scheme from the _ communication - theoretic _ perspective are not available . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the maximum - likelihood detector ( mld ) achieving noncoherent swipt has not been studied yet . in this paper",
    ", we will tackle the noncoherent mlds which characterize the optimum performance benchmark for i d in eh relay systems .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to develop the _ noncoherent _ swipt framework and practical mlds for eh relay networks .",
    "we consider an eh relay system consisting of a source , a destination , and multiple eh relays , which can harvest energy directly from the rf signals radiated by the source and utilize the harvested energy to decode - and - forward the source information to the destination .",
    "the main contributions of the paper are summarized as follows :    * a unified noncoherent swipt framework embracing both _ power - splitting noncoherent df _ ( ps - ncdf ) and _ time - switching noncoherent df _ ( ts - ncdf ) protocols is developed , which supports any @xmath0-dpsk or @xmath0-fsk signalings enabling the noncoherent swipt . * following the unified noncoherent swipt framework , we derive the exact mlds for ps - ncdf and ts - ncdf in a unified form , for both @xmath0-fsk and @xmath0-dpsk signalings .",
    "the exact mlds involve numerical integral evaluations ; yet are useful for characterizing the optimum performance benchmark for i d in noncoherent swipt . * to reduce the computational cost of the exact mlds , we develop _ closed - form _ approximate mlds with substantially lower complexity .",
    "numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approximate mlds achieve almost identical performance to the exact mlds , thus constituting a practical solution for _ noncoherent _ swipt . *",
    "useful insights into the noncoherent swipt are obtained from the communication - theoretic perspective in terms of the symbol - error rate ( ser ) .",
    "specifically , we demonstrate a performance tradeoff between the first and second hops through the adjustment of the time switching coefficient or power splitting factor .",
    "moreover , the optimal values of these system parameters corresponding to the minimum symbol - error rate ( ser ) are strictly between 0 and 1",
    ". finally , we demonstrate that @xmath0-fsk is an energy - efficient solution for noncoherent swipt , especially when @xmath1 . * as a byproduct of this work , we obtain generic analytical results dealing with the distributions of circularly symmetric complex gaussian ( cscg ) random variables and their transformations . these generic results may be of general usefulness for other different applications .",
    "moreover , an _ exact _ expression of the transition ( error ) probability is developed for @xmath0-dpsk .",

    "assist the source - destination communication through the noncoherent df relaying , enabling swipt in eh relay systems where the instantaneous csi is not needed .",
    "we consider a composite fading model where the wireless channels are subject to both small - scale fading and large - scale path - loss .",

    "we consider the _ noncoherent _ communication where the instantaneous csis , @xmath35 , @xmath34 , are unknown to all terminals in the network .",
    "the swipt is accomplished through the noncoherent signalings such as @xmath0-fsk and @xmath0-dpsk . specifically , the source broadcasts rf signals according to the noncoherent @xmath0-fsk or @xmath0-dpsk modulation . the relays",
    "utilize the harvested energy to _ noncoherently _ decode and forward the information to the destination , where the ultimate _ noncoherent _ detection is performed .",
