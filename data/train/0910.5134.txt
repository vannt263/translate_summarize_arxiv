    "the inflationary paradigm is the most consistent scenario to explain the origin of the large scale structure ( lss ) of the universe , as well as the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) @xcite .",
    "originally , an early inflationary era in the universe was invoked as a mechanism to solve several shortcomings of the big bang theory @xcite .",
    "afterwards , it was realised that an early inflationary era of the universe generates density perturbations as seeds for the structure we see nowadays .",
    "in addition , a background of stochastic primordial gravitational waves ( gw ) is also predicted and it is originated from the vacuum fluctuations .",
    "the latter ( gw ) if ever detected in the future would provide an amusing source of information about the early universe . on the other hand , and most importantly , the predictions of the inflationary theory have been corroborated by several cosmological observations like the recent wmap5 data @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we propose a phenomenological model for the inflationary era and the subsequent radiation dominated epoch of the universe . in particular , we suggest a way to extend the framework of the generalised chaplygin gas ( gcg ) to the first stages of the universe . the gcg has attracted a lot of attention over the last years @xcite .",
    "it was initially introduced in cosmology as a mean to unify the dark sectors of the universe , i.e. dark energy and dark matter , and has been contrasted with several cosmological observations @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has been as well shown that some gcg models can be an excellent framework to analyse dark energy related singularities @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we investigate the possible imprints in the power spectrum of the stochastic background of gw , for the model we propose for the transition from the inflationary era to the radiation dominated epoch .",
    "this transition is far from being well known and it can be of some interest to explore the signatures associated with it , shedding light on the inflationary model behind the accelerated expansion in the early universe .",
    "we calculate the gw production using the bogoliubov coefficients which obey a set of differential equations @xcite .",
    "this method has advantages over the frequently used sudden transition approximation , because , associated with it , there is always an overproduction of gravitons of large frequencies , which is avoided in a natural way by the use of the continuous bogoliubov coefficients @xcite .",
    "this is also a very practical method to calculate the full spectrum , from the very low frequencies corresponding to the present cosmological horizon @xmath0hz , till those large , khz up to ghz , frequencies associated with the transition between the inflationary and the radiation - dominated universe .",

    "we summarise the methodology used to obtain the spectrum of the stochastic gw which is based on the bogoliubov coefficients .",

    "on the other hand , having showed that the vertical displacement of the spectra depends only on the value of the inflationary scale , we immediately conclude that the increase in the high frequency region , when @xmath4 moves away from @xmath107 , is a function of the parameter @xmath4 only , as we can see for example in fig .",

    "when the system goes through a complex transition period , with changes in the equation of state , the structure of the spectrum is equally complex , particularly in the hundreds of mhz and ghz regime , allowing us to read a lot of information about the properties of the transition ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    what about the reheating of the universe in our model ?",
    "such a process can be modelled by coupling the scalar field to a radiation fluid , where the decay rate of the scalar field into the radiation fluid is governed by a phenomenological parameter .",
    "in addition , the tail of the potential ( [ scalarfieldpotential ] ) is _ substituted _ by a potential with a vanishing minimum . for the modified model the trend and the level of the spectra of the gw would not be much different to the one presented on this section .",
    "indeed , it is still the parameter @xmath4 that characterises the spectra .",
    "in addition , the inclusion of a reheating process is computationally very much time consuming .",

    ", the parameters of the model have been constrained .",
    "besides the fact that the model suffers a small deviation from the preferred values of the spectral index @xmath67 , the obtained spectra reveal a consistent picture corresponding to a smooth transition between the inflationary and the radiation dominated epochs of the universe , and constitute a significant imprint of this modified generalised chaplygin gas .",

    "this feature implies strong limits to the maximum frequency allowed in our model and which will be within the reach of future gravitational - waves detectors like bbo and decigo @xcite , for the khz range of frequencies .",
    "in fact , for the most consistent values of the @xmath4-parameter , the spectrum shows a frequency as low as in the hz region .",
    "concluding , these results show that , for this model , the hz - khz frequency range comes directly from the transition between the inflationary regime and the radiation era , and addresses important issues about the limits of the gw energy spectrum .",
    "last but not least , we would like to highlight that one of the merits of the model we have presented for the transition from the inflationary era to the radiation dominated epoch is its relative simplicity .",

    "<S> we study the gravitational waves generated by the quantum fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we calculate the gravitational wave power spectrum , as it would be measured today , following the method of the bogoliubov coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the high frequencies region of the spectrum depends strongly on one of the parameters of the model . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , we use the number of e - folds , along with the power spectra and spectral index of the scalar perturbations , to constrain the model observationally . </S>"
