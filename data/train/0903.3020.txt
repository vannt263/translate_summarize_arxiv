    "the hardy s nonlocality test is an experiment that showcases the nonlocality present in entangled states of bipartite as well as multipartite quantum systems . unlike the bell test ,",
    "it is devoid of inequalities .",
    "hardy originally gave the test for a system comprising of the spins of an electron and positron in an experimental setup consisting of two overlapping mach - zehnder interferometers @xcite .",
    "clifton and niemann @xcite generalized it for a system of two spin-@xmath3 particles , which was later reduced to it s minimal form by kunkri and choudhary @xcite . this later version of the hardy s nonlocality test for two spin-@xmath3 particles prescribes a minimal number of non - commuting spin-@xmath3 observables ( two for each spin-@xmath3 particle ) and a minimal number of correlation measurements on the two particles such that one of the correlations gives a measure of the amount of nonlocality .",
    "the conditions on the correlation measurements are such that the four spin-@xmath3 observables , if replaced by @xmath4-valued classical random variables , yield an incompatible set of joint probabilities , thus revealing the nonclassical nature of the quantum correlation present in the joint state of the two spin-@xmath3 particles .",
    "it is known that the hardy s nonlocality test shows a maximum nonlocality ( in terms of a joint probability ) of @xmath5 , over all possible states of two spin-@xmath6 particles , for all possible choices of observables ; and that the maximally entangled states of the system do not respond to the test . in this paper , we explicitly work out the test for systems consisting of two spin-@xmath0 and spin-@xmath1 particles ; we obtain their entangled states along with the sets of appropriate observables that together exhibit maximum nonlocality .",
    "the maximum nonlocality in these systems turns out to be @xmath7 as well and we conjecture that this result holds good for all higher spin values .",
    "validity of this conjecture shows `` persistence of nonlocality '' as opposed to the general notion that higher the spin value @xmath3 , more closer will be the behaviour of the spin-@xmath3 quantum system to a classical one @xcite .",
    "we also show that no maximally entangled state of two spin-@xmath3 particles responds to the hardy s nonlocality test .    in section @xmath8 , the hardy s nonlocality test for two @xmath4-level systems is described . in section @xmath9",
    ", it is shown that no maximally entangled state of two spin-@xmath3 particles satisfies the hardy s nonlocality conditions . in sections",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the hardy s nonlocality test for systems of two spin-@xmath13 , spin-@xmath0 and spin-@xmath1 particles are described , respectively .",
    "having found the maximally nonlocal hardy state with the same amount of maximum nonlocality for @xmath14 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , in section @xmath15 , the generic form of such a hardy state for _ any _ spin @xmath3 and it s maximum amount of nonlocality is discussed and a conjecture made on the persistence of nonlocality .",
    "the result is verified with a discussion of the test for a system of two spin-@xmath16 particles in appendix d. section @xmath17 deals with the conclusion .",
    "some proofs are given in a few other appendices .",
    "the hardy s nonlocality test for two @xmath4-level systems , in it s minimal form , is given by the following conditions : @xmath18 where each of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a @xmath23-valued random variable .",
    "no local realistic theory satisfies these conditions @xcite .",
    "however , there exist quantum mechanical states of two spin-@xmath3 particles for which these conditions are satisfied when the random variables @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are replaced by spin-@xmath3 observables @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , such that @xmath28 ( and @xmath29 ) are non - commuting .",
    "evidently , the @xmath30-th state @xmath31 has to be linearly independent of the first @xmath32 number of states @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath36 , @xmath40 in order that @xmath41 .",
    "so , for a given set of two pairs of non - commuting spin-@xmath3 observables @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the maximum value of @xmath44 will be attained by that state , which is obtained from the @xmath30-th state by projecting out the contributions from the first @xmath32 states in it .",
    "this approach will not help us to test whether an arbitrarily given entangled state of two spin-@xmath3 systems would respond positively to the hardy s nonlocality test given by eq.([hardygen ] ) .",
    "keeping this fact in mind , apart from the maximum value of @xmath44 , we provide in this paper ( for a given set of observables ) , the set of _ all _ states of two spin-@xmath3 particles , each of which will satisfy the conditions in eq.([hardygen ] ) , for a few smaller values of @xmath44 .    in this direction , consider alice and bob , who are two far - apart observers , sharing multiple identical copies of an entangled state of two spin-@xmath3 particles between them .",
    "say alice can perform measurement of any one of the two non - commuting spin-@xmath3 observables @xmath28 on her spin-@xmath3 particle , while bob can perform measurement of any one of the two non - commuting observables @xmath29 on his spin-@xmath3 particle . without any loss of generality , we let alice and bob fix one of their observables along their own independent ( and arbitrary ) z - axes i.e. @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the observables @xmath24 and @xmath26 are then chosen to be of the form : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , with @xmath49 and @xmath50 ; @xmath51 .",
    "note that the two end points @xmath52 ( and also @xmath53 ) are not considered here as @xmath28 ( and also @xmath29 ) are taken to be non - commuting .",
    "the two observers then perform local measurements on each copy of the shared entangled state .",
    "we call these measurements here as _ correlation - measurements_.",
    "here , we show that there exists no maximally entangled state of two spin-@xmath3 particles that responds to the hardy s nonlocality test .",
    "* proof : * assume @xmath55 to be a maximally entangled states in @xmath54 . let @xmath56 be the standard maximally entangled state in @xmath54 .",
    "so , any general maximally entangled state @xmath55 can then be written as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a @xmath59 unitary matrix .",
    "thus , we have here @xmath60    the hardy s nonlocality test in eq.([hardygen ] ) , when applied to @xmath55 , gives rise to the following conditions : @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 ) , we get : @xmath64    these conditions imply that @xmath65    from the condition in eq.([orthoj1 ] ) , we get : @xmath66    from eq.([maxent1 ] ) and eq.([maxent2 ] ) , we get : @xmath67    from eq.([orthoj2 ] ) , for all @xmath68 , we get : @xmath69    thus , for all @xmath68 , we have : @xmath70    using eq.([maxent3 ] ) in eq.([maxent5 ] ) , we get : @xmath71    from eq.([orthoj4 ] ) and eq.([maxent6 ] ) , we get : @xmath72    so , @xmath44 must be zero  a contradiction .",
    "hence , it is proved that there exists no maximally entangled state of two spin-@xmath3 particles that satisfies the hardy s nonlocality conditions . *",
    "for the sake of continuity of argument , in this section we briefly mention the hardy s nonlocality test for states of two spin-@xmath6 particles , which is already known in the literature .",
    "note that in all calculations pertaining to this system , the eigenvalues of the spin-@xmath6 observables are taken to be @xmath73 instead of @xmath74 .",
    "the spin-@xmath6 observables @xmath24 and @xmath26 may be written in their most general form , in the eigen - bases of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , as : @xmath77    their eigenvectors are then given by : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and similar expressions for @xmath80 s with @xmath81 being replaced by @xmath82 . in this system , non - commutativity of the observables at each observer",
    "demands that the eigenvectors of each observable have a strictly non - zero projection on the eigenvectors of the other observable at the same observer i.e. if @xmath83 with @xmath84 , then @xmath85 .",
    "hence , all @xmath86 s and @xmath80 s ( @xmath87 ) in eq.([eigenvec1by2 ] ) are strictly non - zero .",
    "the following conditions constitute the hardy s nonlocality test for the given system : @xmath88 one can show that the four conditions in eq.([prob1by2 ] ) will have contradiction with local - realism .",
    "we associate a state with every condition in the test , say : @xmath89      the states @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are linearly independent and span a 3-d subspace @xmath90 , of @xmath94 .",
    "* proof : * consider a linear combination of @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 equated to zero : @xmath95 @xmath96    since the states in the above equation are mutually orthogonal and all @xmath86 s and @xmath80 s ( @xmath97 ) are strictly non - zero , there exists only a trivial solution , i.e. , @xmath98 .",
    "hence , the three states span a 3-d subspace @xmath90 , of @xmath99 .",
    "* qed *    it is also useful to note here that the states @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath100 can in fact be shown to be linearly independent .",
    "a state @xmath101 that responds to the hardy s nonlocality test , in order to satisfy the correlation conditions in eq.([prob1by2 ] ) , needs to be present in the subspace of @xmath99 , which is orthogonal to @xmath90 , call it the hardy subspace ( @xmath102 ) . since @xmath90 is a 3-d subspace ,",
    "the hardy subspace spans a single dimension .",
    "thus there is a unique state @xmath101 in the hardy subspace corresponding to this system and we call it the hardy state .      using gram - schmidt orthonormalization procedure , one can find an orthonormal basis @xmath103 for @xmath90 as follows : @xmath104    the hardy state @xmath101 , will then be given by : @xmath105    the amount of nonlocality @xmath44 , exhibited by this state , can be found to be : @xmath106 where @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "now , one can find out the values of @xmath109 in terms of the coefficients @xmath110 s and @xmath111 s that appeared in eq.([eigenvec1by2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath44 then takes the form : @xmath112    upon substitution of the values of these coefficients in terms of @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , @xmath44 takes the form : @xmath117      the amount of nonlocality @xmath44 exhibited by the hardy state @xmath101 , can now be maximized by a suitable choice of the observables @xmath118 and @xmath119 , i.e. , by a suitable choice of @xmath113 , @xmath120 ( with arbitrarily chosen @xmath115 , @xmath121 ) .",
    "the two equations @xmath122 give rise to the following solution : @xmath123 .",
    "thus , we see that the optimal value of the symmetric function @xmath44 in eq.([q1by2 ] ) occurs on the plane @xmath124 . now taking @xmath125(say ) in eq.([q1by2 ] ) and maximizing @xmath44 over @xmath126 , one can see that at that value of @xmath127 for which @xmath128 , @xmath44 attains its maximum value , which is equal to @xmath129 .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath126 is @xmath130 degrees .",
    "given _ any _ non - maximally entangled two - qubit pure state @xmath131 , one can always find out the largest eigenvalue @xmath132 of the single qubit reduced density matrix @xmath133 .",
    "note that @xmath134 is the only su(@xmath16)@xmath135su(@xmath16)-invariant of the two - qubit pure state @xmath131 .",
    "the determinant of @xmath136 , @xmath137 , a function of @xmath134 , can also be taken as the invariant quantity instead of @xmath134 .",
    "now , consider the state @xmath101 in eq.([psimax1by2 ] ) .",
    "it takes the following form in the standard basis ( i.e. the basis of the observables @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) : @xmath138 . \\label{psi1std}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the single qubit reduced density matrix @xmath139 , is then given by : @xmath140 whose characteristic equation can be found out to be : @xmath141    hence , @xmath142    by varying the values of the four parameters @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 over all possible allowed values , one can check that @xmath143 will scan the entire interval @xmath144 .",
    "hence , there will exist at least one set of values ( @xmath145 ) , for which @xmath143=@xmath146 .",
    "this will immediately imply that @xmath131 is locally unitarily connected to @xmath101 for the above - mentioned choice of ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "so , @xmath131 will also satisfy the hardy s nonlocality conditions . that any given non - maximally entangled two qubit pure state satisfies the hardy s nonlocality conditions , was shown earlier by goldstein @xcite .",
    "the spin-@xmath0 observables @xmath24 and @xmath26 may be written in their most general form , in the eigen - bases of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , as : @xmath147 and a similar expression for @xmath26 with @xmath148 replaced by @xmath149 .",
    "their eigenvectors are then given by : @xmath150 where @xmath151 and similar expressions for @xmath80 s with @xmath148 replaced by @xmath149 .",
    "in this system , the non - commutativity of observables at each observer gives rise to the following distinct possibilities with respect to the relationship between their eigenvectors .",
    "the eigenvectors of the two observables ( say @xmath152 and @xmath153 ) at an observer could be such that :      however , considering the fact that the observables are spin-@xmath0 observables , the @xmath160 case turns out to be infeasible , while the @xmath161 case occurs only at @xmath162 ( and @xmath163 ) , making @xmath164 ( and @xmath165 ) zero . without any loss of generality , we assume the @xmath166 case to hold good in the following analysis ( the case @xmath167 will be automatically included in this analysis ) .",

    ". the proof for this , can be found in appendix a. it is also useful to note here that the states @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath100 , @xmath170 and @xmath172 can in fact be shown to be linearly independent .",
    "consider the subspace of @xmath171 , which is orthogonal to @xmath90 .",

    "now , by taking @xmath178=@xmath179 , it is ensured that @xmath177 is orthogonal to @xmath100 and @xmath170 .",
    "similarly , taking @xmath178 to be orthogonal to @xmath180 and @xmath181 , @xmath173 takes the form : @xmath173=@xmath182 .",

    "since @xmath173 is orthogonal to @xmath174 and @xmath175 , it may be written as : @xmath204            thus the states @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 are not linearly independent .",
    "when one of the terms in eq.([gen1 ] ) is made equal to zero , say @xmath356 , the determinant of the coefficient matrix takes the form : @xmath357 which is non - zero .",
    "hence , it can be concluded that three out of the four states @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 , are linearly independent and span the 3-d subspace @xmath214 , of @xmath102 .",
