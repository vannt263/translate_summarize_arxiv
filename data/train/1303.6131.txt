    "the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ; @xcite ) was a 0.9 m telescope and moderate - resolution ( @xmath0  ) far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) prime - focus rowland - circle spectrograph developed and built by the johns hopkins university ( jhu ) under the leadership of professor arthur f. davidsen .",
    "hut and two other instruments , the ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ; @xcite ) and the wisconsin ultraviolet photo - polarimetry experiment ( wuppe ; @xcite ) , made up the astro observatory , a spacelab payload that flew on two space - shuttle missions , sts-35 in december 1990 ( the astro-1 mission , on _ columbia _ ) , and sts-67 in march 1995 ( astro-2 , on _ endeavour _ ) .",
    "the three telescopes were co - aligned and shared a pointing system .",
    "the astro-1 mission also included the broad - band x - ray telescope ( bbxrt ; @xcite ) , which was mounted on a pointing system separate from that of the uv telescopes .",
    "the telescopes flew as an attached payload and were operated jointly by the astronauts and a large cadre of support scientists and engineers on the ground .",
    "hut was a ground - breaking instrument in several ways . in first order ,",
    "its 8201850   bandpass provided access to sub - lyman @xmath1 wavelengths ( 9121216  ) unavailable to either the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ or the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ and offered greater sensitivity and resolution than the short - wavelength band of _ iue _  in the region of overlap . in second",
    "order , hut observed a pair of local white - dwarf stars at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths ( 415925  ; astro-1 only ) .",
    "hut was used to observe a broad range of targets , including solar system objects , cataclysmic variable stars , supernova remnants and planetary nebulae , nearby galaxies and starbursts , and quasars and active galaxies @xcite .",
    "a nasa astrophysics data system search shows over 140 refereed publications using hut data , placing the astro spacelab missions among the most scientifically productive space - shuttle missions ever flown .",
    "the hut spectra from both missions were archived initially at the national space science data center ( nssdc ) but were later moved to what is now the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) .",
    "this version of the archived data was lacking in several important respects .",
    "while stored in a valid fits format , they used an iraf - inspired structure that required special software to interpret .",
    "important instrument parameters , including the aperture position angle and any pointing offsets from the principal target position , were not included among the file - header keywords , leading to possible confusion for archival users .",
    "finally , while hut raw - data files provide time resolution of either 1 ms or 2 s , depending on the count rate , no photon arrival - time information was preserved in the original data products , which were stored in a cumulative data format .    to address these shortcomings",
    ", we have re - processed the entire hut archive from both astro missions , modifying the original data - reduction software to produce a new data product , a time - tagged photon list .",
    "similar in format to the intermediate data files ( idfs ) produced by the _",
    "far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ calibration pipeline @xcite , these files record the arrival time and detector coordinate of each photon event recorded by the hut detector .",
    "we have transferred all relevant pointing and instrument - status information from archived science and engineering databases at jhu into new fits header keywords . we have added routines to correct bit - flip errors in the idfs and to flag data obtained when the target was out of the spectrograph aperture .",
    "we have written software to extract and fully calibrate spectra directly from the idfs and used it to produce a new set of calibrated spectral products in a modern fits format .",
    "all of our data products are fully compliant with virtual observatory requirements @xcite .",
    "these newly processed data have been archived and are available through the .",
    "we provide three additional data products .",
    "the first is a quick - look overview plot for each exposure , showing the fully - calibrated spectrum and the pointing error and target count rate throughout the exposure .",
    "these plots are available through the mast browser interface .",
    "the second are hut tv guide - camera images of the target field , obtained at regular intervals throughout each exposure , which are useful for confirming ancillary information such as the location of guide stars and the aperture orientation .",
    "the third are the fully - calibrated first - order spectra of the white dwarfs g191-b2b and hz  43 obtained on astro-1 , from which second- and third - order flux has been subtracted .",
    "these spectra are provided as high - level science products .",
    "finally , all relevant historical and technical documentation about the hut project has been transferred to mast from the retired jhu hut project web site , providing a lasting on - line repository of reference information for archival users .    in section [ sec_instrument ] of this paper , we review the properties of the hut instrument and its observing modes . in section [ sec_idf ] , we step through the hut calibration pipeline and describe how the results of each calibration step are recorded in the idf .",

    "hut consisted of a 0.9 m mirror and a prime - focus rowland - circle spectrograph .",
    "first - order spectral coverage ranged from 820 to 1850  .",
    "the resolution ranged from 2 to 4.5  , with minima near 900 and 1600  , where the flat plane of the detector crossed the curved focal surface of the spectrograph ( see figs .",
    "2022 of @xcite ) . the detector was a microchannel - plate intensified one - dimensional reticon diode array . because of this design , no intrinsic spatial information ( perpendicular to the dispersion axis ) was available .",
    "the plate scale at the detector was 2.8  @xmath4 , so when the pointing was stable ( @xmath5 ) , the resolution was not significantly degraded by image motion . to allow observations of bright targets , the telescope doors could be partially closed , exposing 3.9% , 14.6% , or 50% of the ( 5120 @xmath6 ) primary mirror . for the brightest targets ,",
    "the doors could be fully closed and smaller doors with areas of 1 @xmath6 or 50 @xmath6 could be opened .",
    "both long - slit and circular apertures were available , although the sizes of these apertures were different on the two astro missions ( table [ apertures ] ) .",
    "the configuration and performance of hut on the astro-1 and astro-2 missions are described in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "@xcite present the final calibration of hut for each mission .",
    "for astro-1 , the hut optics were coated with iridium , which provided about 20% reflectivity in the both the extreme ( 500600  ) and far ( 9121216  ) ultraviolet .",
    "the astro-1 mission was beset by a number of technical and hardware glitches , including the pointing system performance .",
    "in all , 86 targets were observed by hut , although many were observed multiple times . using an aluminum filter that blocked first - order light , hut also made unique and important observations of two hot white dwarfs in second order , g191-b2b and hz  43 . for the astro-2 mission ,",
    "the hut optics were coated with silicon carbide ( sic ) , which provided a reflectivity of 30% to 40% over the full first - order bandpass . with a longer mission and better technical performance of the entire system",
    ", hut was used to observe 343 unique targets . again , many were observed multiple times , either to increase the signal - to - noise or to monitor time - variable objects .",
    "no second - order observations were obtained on astro-2 , as sic has a poor reflectance at euv wavelengths .",
    "hut , uit , and wuppe were co - aligned and mounted on the spacelab instrument pointing system ( ips ) , which operated as an attached payload .",
    "observations were accomplished by a multi - stage process that involved the proper orientation of the shuttle , the positioning of the telescope pointing system , and the fine acquisition and guiding of the telescopes themselves .",
    "the astronauts pointed the ips using video from the hut tv guide camera (   [ sec_video ] ) . controlling the ips with a joystick , the crew adjusted its position to move the target into the aperture , using fiducials that showed the expected positions of guide stars for each observation . once the target was acquired , the ips used guide - star centroids computed by hut to maintain pointing . as mentioned above , technical problems on astro-1",
    "often prevented the auto - guide feature from working , and pointing was accomplished by manual control of the ips throughout each exposure by the astronauts .",
    "on astro-2 , the system worked flawlessly , and the resulting data are of significantly higher quality .    for scientific observations ,",
    "hut was operated in either of two observing modes , both of which produced a raw data file every two seconds . in high - time - resolution mode ,",
    "the file contained a photon - event list , reporting the detector x ( dispersion direction ) coordinate and arrival time ( with an accuracy of @xmath71 ms ) of each photon .",
    "this mode was limited to sources whose total count rates did not exceed @xmath8 600 counts s@xmath4 . for brighter sources ,",
    "a histogram mode was employed , producing a cumulative 2048-pixel histogram every two seconds . by subtracting one raw histogram from the next , the number of photons arriving in each pixel during a two - second period could be determined .",
    "in order to provide hut data in a more user - friendly format , we have adopted the time - tagged photon list format of the intermediate data files ( idfs ) employed by calfuse , the data - reduction pipeline for _ fuse _ @xcite .",
    "we have modified the format , however , for two reasons : first , while the _ fuse _ data are two - dimensional , the hut data are not ; only a photon s x coordinate was recorded .",
    "second , we assumed that _ fuse _ users would have access to the entire calfuse data - reduction package , including its various calibration files .",
    "while it is possible to retrieve a version of the hut calibration pipeline from mast , we do not expect users of these new data products to do so .",
    "instead , we record all of the necessary calibration information within each idf .",
    "the format of the hut idf is detailed in appendix [ idf_format ] .",
    "we began with the hut data - reduction pipeline described by @xcite .",
    "the pipeline consists of a series of programs , written in c , that collect the raw data files , group them into individual exposures , construct raw - counts spectra , correct for various instrumental effects , and finally produce fully flux- and wavelength - calibrated spectra .",
    "each routine operates as before , but now calls a new subroutine that creates or modifies the appropriate idf .",
    "we have transferred all relevant pointing and instrument - status information from locally - archived science and engineering databases into new fits header keywords .",
    "we have added new routines to identify and separate offset pointings into separate exposures , correct for telemetry bit flips in the data stream , and flag times when a target was outside the spectrograph aperture .",
    "the initial pipeline module reads a set of raw data files , in either histogram or time - tag format , and produces spectra with units of raw counts per pixel .",
    "this task is complicated by the fact that the astro observatory was controlled in real time by astronauts aboard the space shuttle .",
    "they had the freedom to change instrument parameters , such as the door state or spectrograph aperture , or to tilt the telescope mirror to observe a secondary target during an observation .",
    "support scientists on the ground could also program such changes into the observing sequences uploaded to the telescope , which would execute them automatically . as a result ,",
    "a single planned observation may yield spectra of multiple offset positions observed with different instrument parameters .",
    "the pipeline tracks telemetry for the position of the telescope mirror , the aperture wheel , the telescope doors , etc .",
    ", producing a separate raw spectrum for each change of instrument parameters .",
    "each time it writes a raw spectrum to disk , it calls a new subroutine , cf_ttag_init , which constructs a corresponding idf .    in preparation for flight , a database file was constructed for each planned observation , detailing target parameters , instrument configuration , and expected guide stars .",
    "we used these files to populate header keywords within each idf , including the target s coordinates , magnitude , and redshift , the aperture position angle , and numerous comments describing the goals of the observation .",
    "it was not uncommon to use motions of the primary mirror to move a target out of the aperture and obtain a spectrum of the nearby background . to identify such offset pointings , we search for multiple exposures based on the same database file but with mirror offsets that differ by more than 6 . for such offset exposures , the string `` _ offset ''",
    "is appended to the target name , and the headers include the actual coordinates of the pointing position , rather than those of the primary target .",
    "as described in appendix [ idf_format ] , the idf contains two arrays of status flags , each of which employs the bit codes listed in table [ flags ] . the first set of status flags is associated with the photon event list , which is stored in the first extension of the idf . at this stage of the pipeline , only the airglow bit is set , and only for photons whose x coordinates place them near one of these bright airglow features :  @xmath9 ,  @xmath10 , lyman @xmath11 @xmath12 ,  @xmath13 ,  @xmath14 ( second order ) , lyman @xmath1 @xmath15 ,  @xmath16 ,  @xmath17 ,  @xmath9 ( second order ) , and  @xmath14 ( third order ) .",
    "the second array of status flags is associated with the timeline table ( second extension ) , which contains one entry for each raw data file . in this array ,",
    "the day / night flag is set to 0 if the data were obtained during orbit night , 1 if during orbital day .",
    "the limb - angle flag is set whenever the angle between the target and the earth limb falls below 15 , as absorption by  in the atmosphere can depress spectra shortward of 950   at limb angles up to 12  @xcite . because the astro-1 mission took place during solar maximum , charged - particle fluxes during passage through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) were unacceptably high .",
    "the astro-2 mission occurred during solar minimum , and particle fluxes during the saa were considerably lower .",
    "observations of bright targets , for which the higher background would contribute negligibly to the total signal , were scheduled during saa passes on astro-2 .",
    "thus , astro-1 data obtained during saa passes are flagged as bad ; astro-2 data are not .",
    "the high - background flag is set whenever the total count rate between 850 and 895   exceeds 10 counts s@xmath4 .",
    "the target - out - of - aperture flag is set later in the pipeline and will be discussed below .",
    "the various calibration steps are controlled by a set of file - header keywords initially set to either `` perform '' or `` omit . '' by default , all keywords are set to `` perform . '' if the exposure is identified as an airglow observation , then the ap - flag , jt - flag , and ph - flag keywords are set to `` omit , '' turning off the target - out - of - aperture test , the correction for telescope motion , and the photometric correction .",
    "one could argue that these steps should be omitted for all diffuse targets ( such as supernova remnants ) , but we have done so only for the observations of comet levy and the planetary nebula ngc 1535 ; these objects are discussed in appendix [ sec_notes ] .",
    "ll 8 & user - defined bad - time interval + 7 & not used + 6 & target out of aperture + 5 & background unacceptably high + 4 & observation during saa ( astro-1 only ) + 3 & limb - angle violation + 2 & airglow feature + 1 & day / night flag ( n = 0 , d = 1 ) +      small telescope motions during an exposure have two effects on the data : first , as the target drifts in the dispersion direction , its spectrum shifts on the detector ; the resulting smearing slightly reduces the spectral resolution .",
    "we refer to this effect as jitter .",
    "second , as the target drifts near or beyond the edge of the aperture , flux is lost .",
    "a pair of routines were developed to correct for these effects ; both are described in appendix a of @xcite .    the first program , called imcs_ph_corr , combines pointing information from the observatory ( the image motion compensation system , or imcs ) with the observed target count rate ( excluding airglow features ) to calculate the pitch and yaw errors throughout the exposure , the ( integral ) shift in pixels necessary to correct the observed spectrum for these drifts , and the effective throughput of the exposure .",
    "the program now calls the new subroutine cf_imcs_corr , which writes photometric information ( a quality flag , the best - fit mean target count rate , and the number of data frames used in the analysis , among others ) to keywords in the primary file header .",
    "the pixel shifts are applied to the xraw array and the results written to the x array in the photon event list . pointing information ( a time series of pixel shifts , pitch errors , and yaw errors )",
    "is written to the imcs table ( fourth extension ) as described in appendix [ idf_format ] .",
    "_ caveats : _ imcs_ph_corr attempts to fit a model combining pointing information , the instrument point - spread function ( assumed to be a two - dimensional gaussian with a fwhm of 45 ) , and the dimensions of the aperture to the observed target count rate .",
    "if the reduced @xmath18 value of the best - fit model is less than 10 ( an arbitrary but effective value ) , then it is considered a success , and its corrections for jitter and photometric losses are applied to the data .",
    "if pointing information is unavailable for 100 s or more during an exposure , then the jitter correction is not applied .",
    "the second program , poisson_corr , compares the observed count - rate distribution of the target with a poisson distribution of the same mean count rate using the kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "the program iteratively discards periods with low count rates until the probability that the distribution is poisson is acceptably high .",
    "a quality flag and the corrected mean count rate are written to the idf file header via the new subroutine cf_poisson .",
    "if photons strike the detector faster than they can be read out by the detector electronics , counts may be lost .",
    "corrections for these dead - time effects are calculated by performing a detailed monte carlo simulation of the detector response for each input spectrum .",
    "this procedure is described in appendix b of @xcite .",
    "the program produces a pair of 2048-element arrays containing the dead - time correction and its associated error for each spectral element .",
    "these arrays are passed to the new subroutine cf_deadtime , which writes them to the second extension of the idf , called the calibration table .",
    "as described by @xcite , a phosphor - persistence effect causes approximately 8% of photon events to be read twice by the detector electronics .",
    "because the effect is manifest as a constant multiplicative factor , it was absorbed into the definition of the effective area during the initial processing of the astro-2 data .",
    "for astro-1 , the raw - counts spectra were rescaled in a separate calibration step . here",
    ", we adopt the astro-1 convention for reprocessing both data sets .",
    "the phosphor - persistence correction , a scalar , is written as a header keyword to the idf .",
    "on astro-1 , the mean detector dark rate , measured on - orbit with the aperture closed , was @xmath19 counts s@xmath4 pixel@xmath4 .",
    "on astro-2 , the mean dark rate rose from @xmath20 to @xmath21 counts s@xmath4 pixel@xmath4 when the phosphor voltage setting was raised from 3 to 4 midway through the mission @xcite .",
    "the dark rate appropriate for each data set is stored in the idf as a header keyword .",
    "orbit - to - orbit variations in the background were typically 20% ; these variations are addressed by the scattered - light correction ( see below ) .",
    "flat - field features are fluctuations in the sensitivity of the instrument on wavelength scales of a few ngstroms .",
    "the flat field varied over the course of each flight , as airglow lines and bright emission - line targets reduced the gain in localized regions of the micro - channel plates .",
    "for the astro-1 mission , a single flat - field correction is available for each door configuration ( both open , one closed , etc . ) .",
    "for astro-2 , a set of time - dependent files is used to track the evolution of the flat field for each door configuration over the length of the mission .",
    "the appropriate flat - field array is written to the calibration table of each idf .",
    "the scattered - light and second - order corrections are performed not on the photon list , but on the extracted spectrum .",
    "the scattered light is simply the average number of counts per pixel between 850 and 895   for astro-1 , 840 and 885   for astro-2 , a wavelength range free from airglow emission ( and presumably from astrophysical emission as well , due to the neutral hydrogen cut - off at 912  ) .",
    "the scattered - light level is calculated on the fly and subtracted from each pixel in the extracted spectrum by the spectral - extraction routine .    to correct for the presence of second - order light at long wavelengths , we scale the spectrum between 905 and 932   by the ratio of the second- to first - order efficiency ( 0.223 for astro-1 , 0.21 for astro-2 ) and subtract it from the spectrum between 1810 and 1864  .",
    "the lower - wavelength limit was selected under the assumption that the interstellar medium is opaque below 912  ; this assumption may not be appropriate for nearby white dwarfs and solar - system objects .",
    "the upper limit represents the long - wavelength limit of the hut bandpass .",
    "note that the spectral dispersion in second order is twice that in first order , so each second - order pixel maps to two first - order pixels .",
    "the second - order correction is performed on the fly by the spectral - extraction routine .      for astro-1 spectra",
    ", the hut wavelength scale is assumed to be linear , beginning at 827.36   and increasing by 0.51336   per pixel . for astro-2 ,",
    "the wavelength scale is similar , but deviates from linearity by as much as 1.5   @xcite .",
    "the appropriate wavelength - calibration array is written to the calibration table of the idf , from which it is copied directly into the wavelength array of the extracted spectrum .",
    "the hut flux calibration is derived by comparing model atmospheres of hot da white dwarfs with observations of white dwarf stars from each mission .",
    "details for the astro-1 calibration are given by @xcite and for astro-2 by @xcite .",
    "the inverse - sensitivity curve represents the ratio of a synthetic stellar spectrum to the observed count - rate spectrum of the same star .",
    "its formal units are ( erg @xmath22 s@xmath4 @xmath4 ) per ( count s@xmath4 pixel@xmath4 ) , but they can be expressed more compactly as erg @xmath22 @xmath4 . for astro-1 , a single set of inverse - sensitivity curves is available . for astro-2 ,",
    "a series of time - dependent curves spans the length of the mission ; the curve for each exposure is derived by linear interpolation . for both missions , separate curves are available for each configuration of the telescope doors .",
    "the appropriate inverse - sensitivity curve is written to the calibration table of the idf .",
    "no inverse - sensitivity curve is available for the second - order spectra of g191-b2b ( hut109702 ) and hz  43 ( hut105202 ) obtained on astro-1 .",
    "the first - order curves written to their idfs should not be used .",
    "the spectra extracted from these idfs have units of counts per second .",
    "the prime - focus design of the hut spectrograph resulted in significant astigmatism in the cross - dispersion ( detector y ) direction .",
    "this effect was a function of wavelength , with the longest wavelengths most affected .",
    "the size of the reticon diodes was such that , for point sources , no flux was lost ; however , for diffuse sources filling the long rectangular apertures , a small amount of flux could be missed .",
    "ray traces computed after the astro-1 mission showed that , for apertures 116  long , this effect was @xmath8 2% at 1550  , @xmath8 4% at 1650  , and @xmath8 6% at 1850  .",
    "correction factors for the three largest spectrograph apertures used on astro-2 are presented in fig .",
    "17 of @xcite .",
    "because this effect is small and its relevance depends upon the scientific goals of the observer , we have chosen not to correct for it in our reprocessing .",
    "once the time - dependent photon list is recorded in the idf , we can manipulate the data in ways that are not possible with an extracted , one - dimensional spectrum .",
    "we have written new routines to repair bit flips in the data stream , identify times when the target was out of the aperture , and copy the final set of status flags from the timeline table into the photon - event list .",
    "hut produced a raw data file every two seconds .",
    "these files were recorded on the shuttle and transmitted to the ground at intervals throughout the mission .",
    "errors in the recording or transmission of data could result in bit flips , i.e. , the transformation of a single bit from a zero to a one , or _ vice versa .",
    "_ in histogram mode , such a flip is manifested as a bright ( or faint ) pixel in a single two - second frame .",
    "because our photon list is constructed by subtracting sequential histogram frames , such a bright pixel generates an entry with a large number of counts in a single pixel .",
    "the next frame , without such a peak , generates an entry with a large , negative number of counts at the same pixel location . to correct for this effect ,",
    "we scan each photon list , identify negative - valued entries and the corresponding positive - valued peak , and add and subtract powers of two until the negative - valued trough is filled in .",
    "this redistribution of counts may result in occasional photon - list entries with zero counts . because the total counts in each pixel are preserved",
    ", this exercise does not alter the final , extracted spectrum , but it greatly increases the utility of count rates derived from the data . accordingly , once any bit flips are repaired , the source , airglow , and background rate arrays in the timeline table are recomputed .",
    "the source count rate ( away from airglow lines ) is stored in the timeline table ( hdu 4 ) of the idf .",
    "we use these data to identify and flag times when the target was out of the aperture .",
    "excluding these times improves the signal - to - noise ratio of the extracted spectrum , principally by reducing the background contribution due to scattered airglow emission . in general , the algorithm works as follows : the count - rate array is smoothed with a five - point boxcar .",
    "if the peak value of the smoothed array is greater than 10 counts s@xmath4 , then a threshold is set at 10% of the peak .",
    "if the peak is less than 10 but greater than 5 counts s@xmath4 , then the threshold is set at 2 counts s@xmath4 .",
    "elements of the smoothed array with values less than the threshold are flagged as bad .",
    "if the peak is less than 5 counts s@xmath4 , then no elements are flagged . for bright targets",
    ", the process is repeated with the threshold raised to 20% of the peak at the beginning and end of an exposure and for array elements adjacent to those already flagged as bad .",
    "this algorithm works reasonably well , but many additional bad - time intervals were added by hand  generally at the start of an exposure  and a few intervals initially flagged as bad by the software were later deemed to be acceptable .",
    "a few noteworthy cases are discussed in appendix [ sec_notes ] .",
    "this correction is performed on diffuse targets , if they are bright enough , but not on exposures identified as airglow observations .",
    "once the out - of - aperture flags in the timeline table are populated , the status flags in the timeline table are copied into the corresponding entries in the photon - event list .",
    "the total and night - only exposure times are computed and written to the idf header keywords exptime and expnight .",
    "we have written a new program , cf_extract , to extract and calibrate spectra directly from the idf .",
    "the most straightforward approach to this task would be to construct a spectral histogram using the x coordinates ( corrected for telescope motion ) of each photon event , then apply each of the calibration steps discussed above .",
    "unfortunately , the flat - field correction is defined in raw - pixel coordinates and can not be applied to data already corrected for telescope motion .",
    "this requirement leads to the following iterative scheme : we step through the photon - event list in time order , accumulating a temporary spectral histogram ( using the xraw coordinate ) and checking the difference between xraw and x. when this difference changes , we know that the telescope has moved , so we stop accumulating data .",
    "the temporary spectral histogram is then corrected for detector dead time and phosphor persistence .",
    "( the dead - time correction is smoothed by 13 pixels , so may be applied to either raw or corrected coordinates . )",
    "the dark count is subtracted and the flat - field correction applied .",
    "the spectrum is shifted from the xraw to the x coordinate frame and added to a permanent spectral histogram .",
    "this loop repeats until the photon list is exhausted .    because of dead - time and phosphor - persistence effects , the hut electronics systematically miscounted the number of photon events recorded by the detector . the shot noise in the observed spectrum , however , depends on the actual number of photon events .",
    "we thus apply both the dead - time and persistence corrections , to obtain the true number of photons that hit the detector , before constructing a temporary variance array ( equal at this point to the temporary spectral histogram ) . the uncertainties associated with the persistence , dark - count , and flat - field corrections",
    "are assumed to be negligible and are ignored .",
