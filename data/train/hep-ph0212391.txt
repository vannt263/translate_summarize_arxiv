    "models with large extra dimensions @xcite have been extensively studied in recent years , and have served as a major source of inspiration in the ongoing search of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the general idea behind these scenarios is that the ordinary four dimensional sm emerges as the low energy effective theory of more fundamental models living in five or more dimensions with the extra dimensions compactified .",
    "the effects of the extra dimensions are communicated to the four dimensional world through the presence of infinite towers of kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes , which modify qualitatively the behavior of the low - energy theory . in particular , the non - renormalizability of the theory is found when summing the infinite tower of kk states .",
    "the size of the extra dimensions can be surprisingly large without contradicting present experimental data ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "this offers the exciting possibility of testing these models in the near future , since the lowest kk states , if light enough , could be produced in the next generation of accelerators .",
    "extra dimensions may or may not be accessible to all known fields , depending on the specifics of the underlying , more fundamental theory .",
    "scenarios where all sm fields live in higher dimensions have been the focal point of particular attention  @xcite ) .",
    "this type of extra dimensions is refered to in the literature as `` universal extra dimensions '' ( ued ) . from the phenomenological point of view , the most characteristic feature of such theories is the conservation of the kk number at each elementary interaction vertex @xcite . as a result , and",
    "contrary to what happens in the non - universal case , the coupling of any excited ( massive ) kk mode to two zero modes is prohibited .",
    "this fact alters profoundly their production mechanisms : using normal ( zero - mode ) particles as initial sates , such modes can not be resonantly produced , nor can a single kk mode appear in the final states , but instead they must be pair - produced .",
    "in addition , the conservation of the kk number leads to the appearance of heavy stable ( charged and neutral ) particles , which seem to pose cosmological complications ( e.g. nucleosynthesis ) @xcite ; however , one - loop effects may overcome such problems @xcite .",
    "finally , this conservation yields the additional important feature that , the constraints on the size of the extra dimensions which are obtained from sm precision measurements are less stringent ; this is so because the extra modes do not affect the tree - level predictions , and make their presence felt only through loop corrections .",
    "this last point merits particular attention , given its phenomenological importance , together with the fact that loop calculations in the context of such theories constitute a relatively unexplored territory .",
    "in general the precision electroweak observables most sensitive to radiative corrections , whether from within the sm or from its extensions , are those enhanced by the large top - quark mass : @xmath2 , or equivalently , the process @xmath3 @xcite , the @xmath4 -mixing @xcite , and the @xmath5 parameter .",
    "these observables have already been considered in models with extra dimensions .",
    "thus , @xmath2 was considered , for instance , in @xcite , @xmath4 was considered first in  @xcite and , recently , it has been studied in the context of ued in  @xcite , in the case of theories with ued the study of the corrections to the @xmath5 parameter has yielded a lower bound on the size of the compactification scale , the inverse of the compactification radious , @xmath6 , of about 300 gev  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will study in detail the bound obtained on the size of a single ued from the process @xmath3 .",
    "our experience with the radiative corrections induced by the sm particles suggests that the bounds obtained from this process could in principle be comparable to those extracted from the @xmath1 parameter ; the reason is that the aforementioned enhancement induced by the dependence on the mass of the top - quark takes place in both cases .",
    "a simple one - loop calculation , motivated by the behavior of the theory in its gaugeless limit and subsequently corroborated by a more detailed analysis , reveals that , contrary to what has been claimed in @xcite , the leading corrections to the left - handed @xmath7 coupling , @xmath8 , due to the kk modes corresponding to a single ued , display a strong dependence on the mass of the top - quark ( they are proportional to @xmath9 ) .",
    "this fact makes the bounds obtained from @xmath2 comparable to those obtained from the @xmath1 parameter ; in particular we find @xmath10  gev at 95%  cl .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we start from the five - dimensional lagrangian and after standard manipulations we derive the corresponding four - dimensional interactions and mass spectrum , paying particular attention to the interactions involving top and bottom quarks . in section iii",
    "we first discuss the physical arguments which suggest a strong dependence of the result on the top - quark mass ; then we present a more detailed one - loop calculation which demonstrates precisely the announced leading behavior .",
    "the subleading corrections , e.g. terms suppressed by an additional factor @xmath11 are also estimated . finally , in section iv we present our conclusions .",
    "we will concentrate on the electroweak part , @xmath12 , of the sm lagrangian , written in five dimensions ; we will denote by @xmath13 the four normal coordinates , and by @xmath14 the fifth one , which will undergo compactification .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath15 assumes the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 in the above formulas @xmath18 are the five - dimensional lorentz indices , @xmath19 is the field strength associated with the @xmath20 gauge group , and @xmath21 that of the @xmath22 group .",
    "the covariant derivative is defined as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the five - dimensional gauge coupling constants of @xmath20 and @xmath22 , respectively , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the corresponding generators .",
    "@xmath28 denote the five dimensional gamma matrices , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the metric convention is @xmath31 .",
    "the fermionic fields @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are four - component spinors and carry the same quantum numbers as the corresponding sm fields . @xmath35 and",
    "color indices have been suppressed .",
    "finally , @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote the standard higgs doublet and its charge conjugated field , and @xmath38 are the yukawa matrices in the five dimensional theory ; they mix different generations , whose indices are suppressed .",
    "we do not include lepton or gluon couplings because they are not relevant for our discussion .",
    "next , as usual , we assume that the fifth dimension is compactified on a circle of radius @xmath39 in which the points @xmath40 and @xmath41 are identified ( e.g. an orbifold @xmath42 ) .",
    "fields even under the @xmath43 symmetry will have zero modes and will be present in the low energy theory .",
    "fields odd under @xmath43 will only have kk modes and will disappear from the low energy spectrum .",
    "one chooses the higgs doublet to be even under the @xmath43 symmetry in order to have a standard zero mode higgs field .",
    "then we carry out the fourier expansion of the fields , @xmath44~,\\nonumber\\\\   u ( x , y ) & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi r } } u_r^{(0)}(x )    +   \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{\\pi r } } \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\left [ u_r^{(n)}(x ) \\cos\\left ( \\frac{n y}{r}\\right ) + u_l^{(n)}(x ) \\sin\\left ( \\frac{n y}{r}\\right)\\right]~ , \\label{eq : fourier}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the expansion for @xmath45 applies to any of the gauge fields and ( after suppressing the lorentz index @xmath46 ) for the higgs doublet , whereas that of @xmath47 applies to the fifth component of the gauge fields . similarly , the expansion for @xmath34 is valid also for @xmath33 .",
    "the above expansions allow us to carry out the standard @xmath40 integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : primera ] ) , and obtain the kk spectrum and the relevant interaction terms",
    ". we will mainly be interested in third generation quarks , thus , @xmath48 and @xmath49 will refer to the upper and lower parts of the doublet @xmath32 and the @xmath50 will be kk modes of right - handed top quarks . in particular , the relation between the mass- and gauge - eigenstates of the kk quarks can be expressed as @xmath51 =   \\left[\\begin{array}{cc } ~\\gamma_5 \\cos(\\alpha_n^t ) & \\sin(\\alpha_n^t ) \\\\ - \\gamma_5 \\sin(\\alpha_n^t ) & \\cos(\\alpha_n^t ) \\end{array}\\right ] \\left[\\begin{array}{c } q^{\\prime ( n)}_t\\\\ u^{\\prime(n ) } \\end{array}\\right]~,\\ ] ] and the mixing angle is given by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 .",
    "the case of @xmath49 is similar but since we are neglecting all mass scales except @xmath54 and @xmath55 the mass eigenstate is simply @xmath56 .",
    "the mass spectrum assumes the form ( we remove the primes ) @xmath57    the couplings between the quarks and the scalar modes are important to our purposes , because they are proportional to @xmath54 .",
    "in contrast to what happens within the sm , they will be physical degrees of freedom , i.e. they can not be gauged away by choosing , for example , a unitary - type of gauge . after dimensional reduction , the fifth components of the charged gauge fields , @xmath58 , mix with the kk modes of the charged component @xmath59 of the higgs doublet .",
    "after diagonalization one obtains a physical boson , @xmath60 , and a goldstone boson @xmath61 that will contribute to the mass of the kk gauge bosons .",
    "in particular ,    @xmath62    as seen from the expansion , the @xmath63 has no zero mode , there is no physical zero mode @xmath64 and the zero mode goldstone boson comes entirely from the zero mode higgs field . on the other hand , for @xmath65",
    "the kk goldstone bosons are mainly the @xmath58 , while the physical scalars are mainly the kk modes of the higgs doublet @xmath59 .",
    "their couplings are exactly the same as those of the goldstone bosons of the sm , e.g. @xmath66 where we have written only the third quark generation and in the following we will neglect the mixings , @xmath67 .    the electroweak symmetry breaking proceeds by minimizing a higgs potential of the standard form , e.g. @xmath68 .",
    "the mass terms of the different kk scalar modes are given by @xmath69 , in such a way that if @xmath70 only the neutral component of the fundamental mode , @xmath71 , gets a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath72 . at low energy ,",
    "when no kk modes can be produced , and at tree - level this model coincides exactly with the sm .",
    "in particular , the vev of the zero mode higgs doublet induces mixing between @xmath73 and @xmath74 giving rise to a massless photon , @xmath75 , and a massive @xmath76 boson , @xmath77 .",
    "after a bit of algebra one arrives to the expression of the couplings of the @xmath76 boson with the kk modes of the rest of the fields , given by @xmath78~,\\ ] ] where the @xmath79 is the usual sm neutral current , and @xmath80 here @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath50 are dirac spinors , and the ellipses denote the contribution of @xmath83 fields , which are not relevant for our calculation .",
    "similarly , the interaction of the charged bosons with the quarks is given by @xmath84~.\\ ] ] the couplings of the photon may be derived similarly . from the above equations it is straightforward to extract the necessary feynman rules for our calculations .",
    "the couplings of the photon may be derived similarly .",
    "in this section we will compute the corrections to the effective @xmath86 coupling due to the presence of a single ued .",
    "shifts in the @xmath86 coupling due to radiative corrections , either from within the sm or from new physics , affect observables such as the branching ratio @xmath87 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 , or the left right asymmetry @xmath90 .",
    "these type of corrections can be treated uniformly by expressing them as a modification to the tree level couplings @xmath91 defined as @xmath92 @xmath76 and @xmath93 s are sm fields , @xmath94 are the chirality projectors and    @xmath95    where we have separated radiative corrections coming from sm contributions and from new physics , ( np ) .",
    "it turns out that , both within the sm as well as in most of its extensions , only @xmath8 receives corrections proportional to @xmath96 at the one loop level , due to the difference in the couplings between the two chiralities . in particular",
    ", a shift @xmath97 in the value of @xmath8 due to new physics translates into a shift in @xmath98 given by @xmath99 and to a shift in the left - right asymmetry @xmath90 given by @xmath100 these equations , when compared with experimental data , will be used to set bounds on the compactification scale .    by far",
    "the easiest way to compute the leading top - quark - mass dependent one - loop corrections to @xmath101 from the sm itself , @xmath102 , is to resort to the gaugeless limit of the sm  @xcite , e.g. the limit where the gauge couplings @xmath103 and @xmath104 , corresponding to the gauge groups @xmath20 and @xmath22 respectively , are switched off . in",
    "that limit the gauge bosons play the role of external sources and the only propagating fields are the quarks , the higgs field , and the charged and neutral goldstone bosons @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "as explained in @xcite one may relate the one - loop vertex @xmath107 to the corresponding @xmath108 vertex by means of a ward identity ; the latter is a direct consequence of current conservation , which holds for the neutral current before and after the higgs doublet acquires a vacuum expectation value @xmath109 .",
    "the only diagram contributing to the sm @xmath108 vertex in the gaugeless limit for massless @xmath93-quarks . ]    in practice , carrying out the calculation in the aforementioned limit amounts to the elementary computation of the one - loop off - shell vertex @xmath108 . in the gaugeless limit and for massless",
    "@xmath93-quarks the only contribution to this vertex is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : gaugelesszbbinsm ] , where the cross in the top - quark line represents a top - quark mass insertion needed to flip chirality ( an insertion in the other top - quark line is assumed ) .",
    "this diagram gives a derivative coupling of the goldstone field to the @xmath93-quarks which can be gauged ( or related to the @xmath76 vertex through the ward identity ) to recover the @xmath107 vertex .",
    "then , one immediately finds @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the fermi constant , and the @xmath9 dependence coming from three yukawa couplings and one mass insertion is partially compensated by the @xmath112 dependence coming from the loop integral .    in the case of a single ued",
    "this argument persists : one must simply consider the analog of diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : gaugelesszbbinsm ] , where now the particles inside the loop have been replaced by their kk modes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gaugelesszbbinued1 ] .",
    "if we denote by @xmath113 the new physics contributions in the ued model ( the sm contributions are not included ) the result is @xmath114 and depends _ quartically _ on the mass of the top quark .",
    "notice that there are several differences with respect to the sm : ( i ) the cross now represents the mixing mass term between @xmath81 and @xmath50 , which is proportional to @xmath54 ; ( ii ) the @xmath115 , for @xmath116 , are essentially the physical kk modes of the charged higgses as shown in eq.([eq : physicalhiggs ] ) ; ( iii ) from the virtual momentum integration one obtains now a factor @xmath117 , instead of the factor @xmath112 of the sm case .    the dominant diagram contributing to the ued @xmath108 vertex in the gaugeless limit for massless @xmath93-quarks . ]",

( [ eq : deltaued ] ) with the elementary integration over the feynman parameter @xmath13 already carried out .",
    "notice also that the above result is consistent with the decoupling theorem since the contribution for each mode vanishes when its mass is taken to infinity , e.g. @xmath134 .    in order to compute the effect of the entire kk tower ,",
    "it is more convenient to first carry out the sum and then evaluate the feynman parameter integral ; this interchange is mathematically legitimate since the final answer is convergent .",
    "thus , @xmath135 where @xmath136 , and @xmath137    it is instructive to compare the above result with the one obtained in the context of models where the extra dimension is not universal .",
    "in particular , in the model considered in @xcite the fermions live in four dimensions , and only the gauge bosons and the higgs doublet live in five @xcite . in this case there is no kk tower for the fermions , and therefore , in the loop - diagrams appear only the sm quarks interacting with the kk tower of the higgs fields .",
    "the result displays a logarithmic dependence on the parameter @xmath138 , which gives rise to a relatively tight lower bound on @xmath139 , of the order of 1 tev .",
    "specifically , the corresponding @xmath140 is given by does not include the sm contribution . ]",
    "@xmath141 where the expansion on the second line holds for small values of @xmath138 , and @xmath142 is the derivative of the riemann zeta function .",
    "the appearance of the @xmath143 in @xmath140 and its absence from @xmath144 may be easily understood from the effective theory point of view . due to the kk - number conservation in ued models ,",
    "the tree - level low energy effective lagrangian when all kk modes are integrated out is exactly the standard model ; there are no additional tree - level operators suppressed by the compactification scale .",
    "since one - loop logarithmic contributions , @xmath143 , can be obtained in the effective theory by computing the running of operators generated at tree level , it is clear that in the ued no @xmath143 can appear at one loop in low energy observables .",

    "@xcite , where the leading logarithmic corrections can be computed by using the tree - level effective operators in loops .",

    "<S> we study , at the one loop level , the dominant contributions from a single universal extra dimension to the process @xmath0 . by resorting to the gaugeless limit of the theory </S>",
    "<S> we explain why the result is expected to display a strong dependence on the mass of the top - quark , not identified in the early literature . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed calculation corroborates this expectation , giving rise to a lower bound for the compactification scale which is comparable to that obtained from the @xmath1 parameter . </S>",
    "<S> an estimate of the subleading corrections is furnished , together with a qualitative discussion on the difference between the present results and those derived previously for the non - universal case . </S>"
