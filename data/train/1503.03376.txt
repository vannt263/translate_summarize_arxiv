    "interval exchange transformations have been extensively studied since the works on their ergodic aspects by sinai  @xcite , keane  @xcite , veech  @xcite , rauzy  @xcite , and others . for an overview ,",
    "see  @xcite and references therein . among general dynamical systems ,",
    "interval exchanges have the interesting property that the poincar first return map is again a mapping of the same type , i.e.  an exchange of ( possibly different number of ) intervals .",
    "rauzy  @xcite used this fact to present a generalization of the classical continued fractions expansion .",
    "it is commonly known that interval exchange transformations provide a very useful framework for the study of infinite words arising by coding of rotations , in particular sturmian words .",
    "these are usually defined as aperiodic infinite words with lowest factor complexity .",
    "equivalently , one obtains sturmian words by binary coding of the trajectory under exchange @xmath0 of two intervals @xmath1 , @xmath2 with @xmath3 irrational .",
    "given a subinterval @xmath4 , the first return map @xmath5 to @xmath6 is an exchange of at most three intervals , although the return itineraries of points can take up to four values .",
    "the set of these itineraries can be used to describe certain characteristics of sturmian words , namely the return words , see  @xcite , or abelian return words  @xcite , and invariance under morphisms  @xcite .",
    "infinite words coding exchange of @xmath7-intervals , @xmath8 , are also in focus for several decades  @xcite and , here too , one finds a close relation between their combinatorial features and the properties of the induced map , see for example  @xcite for a result on return words or  @xcite about substitutivity of interval exchange words .",
    "a generalized version of the poincar first return map was used in  @xcite for description of palindromic complexity in codings of rotations .",
    "these words are in intimate relation with three interval exchange words .    in this paper",
    "we focus on codings of a non - degenerate symmetric exchange @xmath9 of three intervals .",
    "first we describe the return times to a general interval @xmath10 and provide an insight on the structure of the set of @xmath6-itineraries .",
    "these results are given as theorem  [ t : returntime ] and then interpreted as analogues of the well known three gap and three distance theorems .",
    "a particular attention is paid to the special cases when the set of @xmath6-itineraries has only three elements .",
    "these cases belong to the most interesting from the combinatorial point of view , since they provide information about return words to factors , and about the morphisms preserving three interval exchange words .",
    "for mutually conjugated morphisms , we describe in theorem  [ t : interceptconjug ] the relation between intercepts of their fixed points , as was done for sturmian morphisms in  @xcite .",
    "we also show that morphisms conjugated only to themselves do not have a non - degenerated fixed point .",
    "the most important application of our results is a contribution to the solution of the question stated by hof , knill and simon  @xcite for palindromic words .",
    "we refer to it as the hks conjecture and adopt its reformulation by tan  @xcite who showed its validity for binary words .",
    "labb  @xcite presented a counterexample for the conjecture on ternary alphabet ; the ternary word not satisfying the hypothesis turns out to be a degenerate three interval exchange word .",
    "in fact , degenerate three interval exchange words are just morphic images of binary , in fact sturmian , words . in this paper",
    "we show that for non - degenerated words coding exchange of three intervals the hks conjecture holds .",
    "let us mention that the latter result has been announced at the dlt conference  @xcite .",
    "here we provide a full proof .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : prelim ] contains the necessary notions from combinatorics on words .",
    "symmetric @xmath7-interval exchange transformations and their properties with respect to the first return map are treated in section  [ sec : iet ] .",
    "section  [ sec:3iet ] focuses on specific properties when @xmath11 .",
    "the main theorem about return times in three interval exchanges is given in section  [ sec : returntimes ] . in section  [ sec : gap ] we put our results into context of three gaps and three distance theorems .    the specific case when the set of @xmath6-itineraries has only three elements is studied in section  [ sec:3 ] .",
    "this allows us to describe the return words to palindromic bispecial factors . in section  [ sec : substitutions ] we focus on substitution invariance of words coding interval exchange transformations .",
    "the key lemma for the demonstration of our theorem  [ thm : hks ] on hks conjecture requires some knowledge about the relation of substitutions fixing words coding three interval exchange and sturmian morphisms .",
    "this topic is treated in section  [ sec : ternarizace ] .",
