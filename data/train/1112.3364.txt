    "<S> angular momentum is transported outwards through an accretion disc by magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) turbulence thus allowing material to accrete on to the central object . </S>",
    "<S> the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) requires a minimum ionisation fraction to drive turbulence in a disc . </S>",
    "<S> the inner parts of the disc around a young stellar object are sufficiently hot to be thermally ionised . further out , cosmic rays ionise the surface layers and a dead zone forms at the mid - plane where the disc is too cool for the mri to operate . the surface density in the turbulent active layer is often assumed to be constant with radius because the cosmic rays penetrate a constant layer . however , </S>",
    "<S> if a critical magnetic reynolds number , @xmath0 , is used to determine the extent of the dead zone , the surface density in the layer generally increases with radius . for small critical magnetic reynolds number of order 1 , the constant layer approximation may be a reasonable fit . </S>",
    "<S> however , mhd simulations suggest the critical magnetic reynolds number may be much larger , of order @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> analytical fits for the surface density in the magnetic active layer show that @xmath2 , at temperature @xmath3 and radius @xmath4 , are a good fit for higher critical magnetic reynolds number . for the metallicity variation between our galaxy , the lmc and the smc </S>",
    "<S> , there should be no significant difference in the extent of the dead zone . </S>",
    "<S> observations suggest an increase in the lifetime of the disc with decreasing metallicity that can not be explained by the dead zone structure ( ignoring possible differences in dust abundances ) .    </S>",
