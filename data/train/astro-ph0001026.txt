    "for over three decades , it has been well established that ( some ) supernova explosions give rise to strongly magnetized ( @xmath5 g ) , rapidly rotating ( @xmath630 ms ) neutron stars ( nss ) , as in the young radio pulsars found in the crab nebula and nearly a dozen other supernova remnants ( snrs ) . in some cases ,",
    "a synchrotron nebula ( or `` plerion '' ) has been detected around the pulsar , powered by non - thermal emission from the ns .",
    "emission ( in some cases pulsed ) has been detected at other wavelengths ( optical , x - ray , gamma - ray ) arising from thermal and non - thermal processes .",
    "however , several clues have recently emerged suggesting that this paradigm is incomplete ( see kaspi 2000 and gotthelf & vasisht 2000 for recent reviews ) .",
    "first , there are the six slowly - rotating ( @xmath7 s ) `` anomalous x - ray pulsars '' ( axps ) , which seem to be young isolated nss and may have extremely strong ( @xmath8@xmath9 g ) surface magnetic fields ( mereghetti 2000 ) .",
    "half of the axps are associated with snrs .",
    "possibly related are the four known soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) , which in quiescence share many properties with axps and may also be associated with snrs ( hurley 2000 ) .    also intriguing",
    "has been the identification of at least three radio - quiet non - plerionic x - ray point sources near the centers of snrs ( pup a , rcw  103 , and pks 120952 ; see brazier & johnston 1999 and references therein )",
    ". these objects have x - ray spectra roughly consistent with young , cooling nss , but show no evidence for either x - ray pulsations or emission at other wavelengths ( in contrast to `` normal '' young nss ) . finally , the ongoing failure to detect clear evidence for a young ns in the remnant of sn 1987a in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) has renewed theoretical interest in alternative models for the aftermath of a sn explosion , especially with respect to fallback of ejected material onto a newborn ns .",
    "several groups have concluded that , under some circumstances , a newborn ns might collapse into a black hole ( bh ) shortly after birth ( brown & bethe 1994 ; woosley & timmes 1996 ; zampieri et al . 1998 ; fryer , colgate , & pinto 1999 ) .",
    "nearby snrs without known stellar remnants are thus obvious targets for further study .",
    "after sn 1987a , the youngest known snr in our galaxy or the satellite magellanic clouds is cassiopeia a. its parent supernova was evidently noticed ( though misunderstood ) by flamsteed in 1680 ( ashworth 1980 ) .",
    "this @xmath10 yr historical age for cas  a is consistent with its optical expansion time scale ( van den bergh & kamper 1983 ) , though somewhat shorter than its x - ray ( @xmath11 yr ; koralesky et al .",
    "1998 , vink et al . 1998 ) and radio ( @xmath12750870 yr ; anderson & rudnick 1995 ) expansion time scales .",
    "the progenitor of this oxygen - rich snr was probably a very massive ( zero - age main sequence mass @xmath13 ) late wn - type wolf - rayet star which underwent prodigious mass loss via a stellar wind and eventually exploded as a type ii supernova ( fesen , becker , & blair 1987 ) . the inferred distance to cas  a is @xmath14 kpc ( reed et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the remnant subtends 4 arcmin in the sky , is one of the brightest non - thermal radio sources , and has been extensively studied in the radio , optical , and x - ray bands .",
    "the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ `` first light '' observation on 1999 august 20 revealed the presence of a compact x - ray source near the geometric center of cas  a ( tananbaum 1999 ) .",
    "the source morphology is point - like , with no obvious evidence for extension or a surrounding nebula ( e.g. , a plerion ) .",
    "the discovery announcement notes that no obvious counterparts were detected within a 5 arcsec radius of the point source position on 20 cm radio maps or optical images .",
    "previous x - ray missions lacked sufficient spatial resolution to separate the point source from the diffuse snr emisison .",
    "however , armed with the _ chandra _ position , aschenbach ( 1999 ) detected the point source in archival 0.12.4 kev x - ray images taken with the _",

    "the _ einstein _ , _ rosat _ , and _",
    "count rates were consistent with a constant x - ray source flux over all the observations ( pavlov & zavlin 1999 ; pavlov et al .",
    "they also noted that the observed spectrum appeared to be inconsistent with pure blackbody radiation from the entire surface of a cooling ns .",
    "umeda et al .",
    "( 2000 ) speculated on some possible scenarios for the nature of the point source , based on these early results .    in this paper , we present a detailed analysis of the x - ray spectral and timing features of the central point source in cas  a , based on the available public _",

    ", we have restricted our analysis to the four exposures obtained during 1999 august 2023 with cas  a placed on the back - illuminated ( bi ) acis s3 chip , for three reasons .",
    "first , preliminary analysis showed that the point source spectrum was relatively soft , and the two bi chips ( s1 and s3 ) have superior low energy response compared to the front - illuminated ( fi ) chips .",
    "second , we wished to optimize the _",
    "chandra _ point spread function by minimizing the off - axis angle of the point source , and the _ chandra _ aim points for acis lie on either the s3 or i3 chips .",
    "inspection of the cas  a images obtained on the other acis chips shows that the point source is spread out over many more pixels , making it more difficult to separate from the background ; the effective area of the mirror and detector combination at these angles is also reduced .",
    "finally , the bi chips have not suffered the radiation damage that degraded the energy resolution of the fi chips soon after launch , and so are better calibrated at this early stage in the mission .",
    "a summary of the observations we used is given in table  1 .",
    "we obtained the fully processed ( level 2 ) acis event data for these observations from the _ chandra _ data archive .",
    "the data were acquired in timed - exposure / faint mode , with a frame read out every 3.2  s. a substantial number of frames was lost to telemetry saturation due to the high total count rate from cas  a , resulting in an overall observation duty cycle of 42% .",
    "we filtered the events from the surviving frames , accepting only those which fell within the `` standard '' event grade set ( grades 0 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 ) in order to maximize the ratio of x - ray to non  x - ray events , and additionally discarding events with very large pulse heights as due to cosmic rays .",
    "for all the observations , the acis focal plane temperature was @xmath25  c.    we did not attempt to improve upon the spacecraft aspect solutions from the standard processing , but instead proceeded from the assumption that the central source in cas  a is indeed point - like in morphology , as determined by tananbaum ( 1999 ) .",
    "for each observation , we extracted all events located within a given radius of the centroid position of the point source .",
    "ideally , we would use the calibrated angular response of the hrma to choose an extraction radius which encircled some fixed fraction ( e.g. , 95% ) of the flux from a point source for a given off - axis angle .",
    "however , both the focus position of the detector and the quality of the spacecraft aspect solution were not necessarily optimal in these early observations . instead , we measured the radial distribution of source photons for each observation from the data and estimated a 95% extraction radius .",
    "table  1 lists the aperture sizes .",
    "the background in the point source region is dominated by the diffuse emission of the supernova remnant and has strong contributions from both continuum and line emission ( e.g. , holt et al .",
    "the point source is located within a relatively low surface brightness region of the remnant .",
    "still , the background must be estimated with care , as there are significant compositional gradients in this part of the remnant ( and perhaps variations in the underlying plasma conditions ) , resulting in varying line strengths with position ( see also hughes et al .",
    "after investigating the line strengths in a number of nearby regions , we selected an off - centered @xmath26 arcsec@xmath27 rectangular region around the point source ( with the point source itself and a small surrounding buffer region excluded ) to estimate the background surface brightness near the point source . the point source and the background region",
    "are shown in figure 1",
    ".    the acis instrumental response may be parameterized by a photon energy redistribution matrix ( hereafter rmf ) , which maps incident photon energy to detected pulse height amplitudes ( phas ) . every acis chip ( @xmath28 )",
    "is divided into four parallel ( @xmath29 ) quadrants , each read out separately by four individual amplifiers .",
    "each quadrant requires a unique rmf , as each readout amplifier has a different gain .",
    "additionally , the parallel and serial charge transfer inefficiency in the bi chips leads to differences in energy resolution and detection efficiency versus position within a quadrant as well .",
    "consequently , the acis instrument team has supplied multiple position - dependent rmfs for each quadrant .",
    "we used the 1999 october 28 version of rmfs developed for observations taken at a focal plane temperature of @xmath25 c.    fortuitously , the cas  a point source ( and nearly all of the selected background region ) lies entirely in quadrant 2 for all four of the s3 observations .",
    "furthermore , the four observations were located within 250 pixels of each other within the chip quadrant , minimizing the differences in ccd response . thus , the four rmfs appropriate for each observation may be combined without any serious loss of accuracy .",
    "this allows us to sum the four individual s3 count spectra into a single `` grand total '' s3 count spectrum with improved statistics .",
    "in addition to the rmfs , an ancillary response function ( hereafter arf ) is needed to characterize the effective area of the hrma and the quantum efficiency of the acis detector as a function of incident photon energy and off - axis angle .",
    "we computed the appropriate arf for each observation using software created by members of the acis and high energy transmission grating instrument teams at mit .",
    "the overall instrumental response is given by the product of the rmf and the arf .",
    "we computed this product for each observation , and then combined these products by an exposure - weighted average for use with our summed count spectrum .",
    "the summed , background - subtracted acis count spectrum was analyzed using the xspec v10.00 software package ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "we rebinned the data at 0.15 kev resolution ( 32 adu / channel ) and restricted our analysis to 21 bins in the 0.74.0 kev range , resulting in at least 10 count bin@xmath30 in all but 3 bins at high energy ( with a minimum of 5 count bin@xmath30 and a maximum of 71 count bin@xmath30 ) , and a total of 630 counts .",
    "the rebinned count spectrum is shown in figure  2 .    in light of the relatively low count rate ,",
    "our model fitting weighted each bin by @xmath31 rather than @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is the number of counts in bin @xmath34 ) .",
    "this is a superior weighting scheme when @xmath33 is small and asymptotes to the usual weighting when @xmath33 is large ( gehrels 1986 ) .",
    "we fit several different spectral models to these data : a simple power law , thermal bremsstrahlung , an ideal blackbody ( bb ) , and two modified bb models .",
    "the modified bb models assume that the emitting object is a ns and account for the effect of a light - element stellar atmosphere on the emergent spectrum .",
    "the strong ns surface gravity essentially guarantees that the photosphere will be dominated by the lightest element present ( alcock & illarionov 1980 ; romani 1987 ) . for such atmospheres with @xmath35",
    "k , the @xmath36 dependence of free - free absorption will shift the peak of the emission blueward from that of an ideal bb ( romani 1987 ; zampieri et al .",
    "previous authors have shown that neglecting this effect and fitting the wien tails of such spectra with an ideal bb model significantly overestimates the effective temperature and underestimates the emitting area ( rajagopal & romani 1996 ; zavlin , pavlov , & shibanov 1996 ; rutledge et al .",
    "1999 ) . to consider this possibility , we employed two models : the simple analytic spectrum emerging from the power - law atmosphere of heyl & hernquist ( 1998a ; hereafter hh98a ) , with @xmath37 as appropriate for a light - element atmosphere ; and the more detailed h atmosphere model of zavlin , pavlov , & shibanov ( 1996 ; hereafter zps96 ) , developed for a weakly magnetized ns .",
    "for all these models , we included the effect of photoelectric absorption by neutral gas along the line of sight ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) , which is a significant effect at low ( @xmath38 kev ) energies . with the relatively small number of low - energy x - ray photons detected from the cas  a point source , it is difficult to constrain @xmath39 precisely .",
    "moreover , its value in this situation is highly spectral - model  dependent and strongly covariant with the overall flux normalization .",
    "however , @xmath40 may also be determined from radio measurements of the atomic and molecular hydrogen column densities using the 21  cm and 18  cm oh absorption lines , respectively .",
    "keohane , rudnick , & anderson ( 1996 ) have used such data to derive a spatially - resolved column density map of the cas  a snr at 30 arcsec resolution . using this map",
    ", we estimate that the column density towards the cas  a point source is @xmath41 @xmath42 .",
    "however , this estimate must be used with caution , as the radio maps give no information on small  angular - scale variations in the column . for each spectral model we employed ,",
    "we fit the data both with @xmath40 held fixed at this value and with @xmath39 as a free parameter .",
    "our spectral fitting results are summarized in table 2 , and a typical model fit is shown in figure 2 .",
    "all of the models gave formally acceptable fits values are less than unity in some cases does not imply that the measurement uncertainties ( given by poisson statistics ) are underestimated .",
    "the probability of obtaining a reduced @xmath43 as small as 0.7 with only 19 degrees of freedom ( assuming the true model is being fit ) is 18% , which is thus within the 1@xmath0 range for an acceptable fit . ] ; we are unable to reject any of them on the basis of these data . however , the bb and ns atmosphere models fit slightly better to the data than the other models , although with inferred radii considerably smaller than the 10 km typically assumed for a ns radius .",

    ", we made a rough check of these calibrations by fitting the x - ray spectral data from the 1999 aug 23 acis / s3 observation of snr e0102@xmath7972 ( obsid 1231 ) , the brightest supernova remnant in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ; hayashi et al .",

    "the derived plasma temperatures agree to better than 2% , and the overall normalizations to within 13% , using the preliminary calibrations .",

    "the overall count rate ( @xmath80 count s@xmath30 ) from cas  a was below the telemetry threshold ( @xmath81 184 count s@xmath30 ) where deadtime effects become significant . for each observation",
    ", we extracted all events within 3 arcsec of the point source centroid to conservatively ensure that all source photons were included .",
    "the photon arrival times , provided in terrestrial time ( tt ) at the spacecraft , were corrected to barycentric dynamical time ( tdb ) at the solar system barycenter using the jpl de200 solar system ephemeris ( standish et al . 1992 ) and a geocentric spacecraft ephemeris .",
    "we binned the events into 0.5 ms time bins and computed a fourier power spectrum of the resulting time series .",
    "no significant pulsations were detected ; the highest peak in the power spectrum had a significance of only 2@xmath0 when the number of trials is accounted for . to improve our statistics , we also computed an incoherent power spectral sum of 9 ks segments of each observation .",
    "again , no significant pulsations were found , with the highest peak having a significance of only 0.8@xmath0 including the number of trials .",
    "a large pulse frequency derivative might spread a coherent pulsation over multiple power spectral bins , reducing our sensitivity .",
    "however , for the @xmath82 ks observations used here , a pulse frequency derivative of @xmath83 hz  s@xmath30 would be required .",
    "this is 25 times larger than @xmath84 for the crab pulsar , and @xmath85 larger than the typical value for an axp or sgr . to enhance our sensitivity to non - sinusoidal pulse shapes",
    ", we also performed harmonic folds of the power spectrum ( see , e.g. , de jager , swanepoel , & raubenheimer 1989 ) .",
    "no significant pulsations were detected .",
    "after our initial analysis was completed , we learned of a wiring problem in the hrc on - board electronics that causes hrc events to be time - tagged incorrectly ( s.  s. murray 2000 , private communication ; seward 2000 ) .",
    "the net effect of the problem is that the timing accuracy of the hrc is degraded from 16 @xmath17s to @xmath864 ms .",
    "consequently , we conservatively conclude that the hrc analysis presented here has no sensitivity to pulsations with frequency above 50  hz .",
    "we used our incoherent power spectral sum to estimate an upper limit for the sinusoidal pulsed fraction of the cas  a point source , accounting for the suppression of power spectral sensitivity at higher frequencies due to binning of the data ( e.g. , van der klis 1989 ) .",

    "the frequencies measured in the two data sets were consistent within the uncertainties , and also agreed with the value extrapolated from a timing model based on a 1996 _ bepposax _ observation ( mineo et al .",
    "we have shown that the x - ray point source in cas  a has a spectrum well - described by either an absorbed power law with photon index 2.83.6 and unabsorbed 0.110 kev luminosity ( 7160)@xmath88 erg s@xmath30 , or an absorbed bb or modified bb with @xmath890.5 kev and bolometric luminosity @xmath905)@xmath88 erg s@xmath30 .",
    "our _ chandra _ spectral and timing measurements , combined with pre - existing limits at other wavelengths , severely constrain plausible models for the nature of the x - ray point source in cas  a.    we begin by pointing out , for completeness , that our steep power law spectral fit essentially rules out the possibility that the point source is a background galaxy , as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) typically lie within a range of photon indices @xmath912.2 ( turner & pounds 1986 ) .",
    "the agn scenario is also extremely implausible given that the point source is located within a few arcsec of the expansion center of the snr ( tananbaum 1999 ) . moreover , given the surface density of agns on the sky at this flux level ( boyle et al .",
    "1993 ) , the probability of a chance coincidence is negligible . there is thus extremely strong inferential evidence that the point source is indeed associated with the supernova remnant .",
    "we now summarize the implications of our results for several other interpretations .",
    "if the cas  a point source is a classical young pulsar ( the conventional product expected for a type ii sn explosion ) , then the x - ray radiation should be predominantly non - thermal power - law emission from relativistic acceleration of @xmath92 pairs in the corotating ns magnetosphere ( see romani 1996 ) . in table  3 ,",
    "the properties of the point source are compared with the six young ( @xmath93 yr ) classical pulsars whose x - ray spectra are well measured .",
    "all six of these pulsars have power law x - ray spectra with @xmath941.7 .",
    "the clearest distinction is that the spectral shape of the cas  a point source is considerably steeper than that of the young pulsars , although its x - ray luminosity is marginally consistent with the lower end of the young pulsar range .",
    "the upper limit on the point source s x - ray pulse fraction ( @xmath95% ) is lower than at least three of the measured pulsed fractions in the young pulsars . in the other three pulsars ,",
    "the _ lower _ limit on the pulsed fraction is consistent with the point source s upper limit , but it is likely that these pulsar lower limits are a drastic underestimate due to the presence of plerionic emission .",
    "radio pulsations have not been detected from cas  a , with an upper limit of @xmath96 mjy kpc@xmath27 for the 600  mhz radio luminosity ( lorimer , lyne & camilo 1998 ) , in contrast to five of the six young pulsars .",
    "this non - detection in cas  a could be explained by beaming , judging from the observed radio luminosities in young pulsars ( @xmath97   mjykpc@xmath27 for the crab and psr b054069 , but only @xmath98  mjykpc@xmath27 for psr b150958 , psr j11196127 , and psr j16175055 ; taylor , manchester , & lyne 1993 ; kaspi et al .",

    "images also show no obvious evidence for a plerion surrounding the point source .",
    "plerions , powered by synchrotron emission , have been detected around five of the six classical young pulsars in table  3 ( the exception is psr j16175055 ; kaspi et al .",

    "a very low - mass dwarf companion might have evaded detection , but such a companion would be unlikely to remain bound in the binary following the supernova explosion , given the high mass of the cas  a progenitor ( brandt & podsiadlowski 1995 ; kalogera 1996 ) .",
    "we begin with the possibility of accretion onto a ns . if the accretion occurs via a thin disk extending down to the marginally stable orbit at @xmath124 , or the ns surface ( whichever is larger ) , then we expect significant emission from an equatorial boundary layer where the accreting material meets the star .",
    "the emitting zone is expected to have a radial extent roughly equal to the local scale height of the disk ( narayan & popham 1993 ; see also inogamov & sunyaev 1999 for a recent discussion of boundary layer models ) .",
    "if the boundary layer is optically thick , then it will emit bb radiation .",
    "for an accretion luminosity @xmath125 , the scale height is @xmath126 km , and the effective area of the radiating zone is @xmath86few km@xmath27 .",

    "very little material would reach the neutron star and there would be negligible x - ray emission ( e.g. , chatterjee , hernquist , & narayan 2000 ; alpar 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "if the ns instead has a magnetic field @xmath131 g typical of young radio pulsars , then boundary layer emission is unlikely to explain the observed x - rays . in this case",
    ", we would have to assume that the accreting material is able to reach the surface of the neutron star , which would require that the neutron star be spinning quite slowly ( in order to avoid centrifugal expulsion of matter ) .",
    "the effective area of the radiating zone would again be small , and could thus be consistent with the observations .",
    "however , we would predict strong coherent pulsations in the x - ray signal .",
    "our upper limit of 25% on the pulsed fraction from the cas  a point source does not rule out pulsations at the level observed in many known @xmath5 g accreting pulsars .",
    "more sensitive searches for pulsation would be very worthwhile .",
    "a third kind of accreting ns model is one in which the accretion disk is truncated at a large transition radius , and the flow farther in occurs via an adaf ( as in the narayan et al .",
    "1997 model for low - luminosity bh binaries ) .",
    "boundary layer emission in such a model is not well understood , so we are not in a position to predict the emission spectrum .",
    "however , if the adaf is terminated at @xmath127 and the material then flows onto the magnetic poles , the spectrum would be similar to the case with a thin disk which was discussed above .",
    "accreting bh models face considerably greater difficulty in fitting the observations .",
    "this is because neither a boundary layer nor channeled accretion onto magnetic poles is expected .",
    "therefore , any blackbody emission should be primarily from the inner accretion disk , with an effective area of several times @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the schwarzschild radius of the black hole . for a @xmath134 bh ,",
    "the area is @xmath135 km@xmath27 , which is clearly inconsistent with the x - ray data .",
    "this means that the x - ray emission from a bh point source in cas  a would have to originate either via compton scattering in an optically thin corona over a thin disk , or via optically thin bremsstrahlung emission from a hot adaf .",
    "we have explored models of this kind , using the modeling techniques described in narayan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and quataert & narayan ( 1999 ) , but we find that we need to fine - tune the models to an uncomfortable degree to fit the observations .",
    "it is important to note that accretion models are severely constrained by the observed flux ratio between x - ray and optical bands .",
    "the optical limits on a stellar remnant in cas  a are @xmath136 and @xmath137 ( van den bergh & pritchet 1986 ) . applying the extinction corrections",
    "estimated by these authors , the x - ray  to  optical flux ratio is @xmath138 .",
    "although this is typical for bright x - ray binaries , it is considerably larger than the ratios observed in quiescent accreting bhs and nss with luminosities comparable to the cas  a point source , e.g. @xmath139 for the bh system a062000 and @xmath140 for the ns system cen x-4 ( mcclintock & remillard 2000 ) .",
    "both sources have an x - ray luminosity lower than the point source in cas  a , and both have optical luminosities significantly higher than the upper limit for the cas  a source .",
    "if the spectra of these sources are characteristic of accreting bhs and nss at low luminosities , then accretion models for cas  a are ruled out with high confidence .",
    "it is possible , however , to evade this conclusion by arguing that these low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are a poor comparison to the cas  a point source .",
    "first of all , the quiescent optical emission in some bh binaries has been modeled as synchrotron emission from a hot advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) close to the bh ( narayan , mcclintock & yi 1996 ; narayan , barret & mcclintock 1997 ) .",
    "however , if the emission instead comes from a `` hot spot '' ( e.g. , where the accretion stream from the mass donor hits the thin accretion disk ) , then it is specific to binary systems and should be absent in systems with a fallback disk .",
    "this possibility has not been modeled in any detail .",
    "also , x - ray reprocessing in the accretion disk is a significant source of optical emission in lmxbs ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 ) , especially since the outer disks evidently subtend a large semi - angle ( @xmath141 ) at the central object ( de jong , van paradijs , & augusteijn 1996 ) .",
    "the reason for such large angles may be warping of the outer disk ( see dubus et al .",
    "1999 ; esin et al .",
    "but if such warps are induced primarily by binary effects , then a fallback disk in cas  a might not be similarly warped ( although it has been argued that irradiation alone can lead to significant warping ; see petterson 1977 ; pringle 1996 ; maloney et al .",
    "for an unwarped disk , the subtended semi - angle would be set by the disk s scale height at the relevant radius ( @xmath142 cm ) . by employing an analysis similar to that in perna , hernquist & narayan ( 1999 )",
    ", we estimate that the re - emitted optical flux in such a model would be ( just ) below the optical flux limits for the cas  a source .",
    "thus , the optical limits strongly constrain accretion models , but do not yet conclusively eliminate them . by comparing the predictions of the models with the x - ray observations , specifically the small effective area @xmath143 of the emission",
    ", we conclude that models with accreting nss are more promising than those with bhs .",
    "it is interesting to compare the properties of the cas  a point source with three classes of objects whose nature remains puzzling : axps , sgrs , and the radio - quiet non - plerionic x - ray point sources in snrs . both axps and sgrs pulse with slow spin periods despite being young objects ( based on their association with snrs ) .",
    "we summarize the x - ray properties of these objects in table  3 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of most axps is best characterized by a two - component spectrum consisting of a @xmath144 kev bb and a steep ( @xmath1454 ) power law extending out to 10 kev , with comparable luminosity in both components .",
    "the bb components have @xmath1464 km and @xmath147@xmath148 erg s@xmath30 , quite similar to the bb fit for the cas  a point source .",
    "( we note that , due to poor photon statistics in the present data , we would be unable to detect the presence of an additional power - law component with this bb fit if the cas  a point source has an axp - like two - component spectrum . )",
    "while four of the axps have large pulsed fractions ( 3070% ) , two have much lower pulsed fractions ( 1015% ) which are consistent with the non - detection of pulsations in cas  a. however , the x - ray luminosity of the cas  a source is at least a factor of three to ten lower than that of the axps , in spite of its relative youth .",
    "overall , the properties of the cas  a point source are roughly consistent with being an underluminous axp",
    ". this possibility can be tested by a deeper search for long - period x - ray pulsations .",
    "the quiescent emission of sgrs may be fit with a power law with @xmath942.5 and a 210 kev luminosity of ( 3100)@xmath149 erg s@xmath30 .",
    "these spectral parameters are also consistent with those measured for cas  a. however , we note that the proposed associations between sgrs and snrs are somewhat tenuous , in contrast to those proposed for axps ( gaensler 2000 ) .",
    "moreover , no soft gamma - ray bursts have ever been detected from the direction of cas  a.    finally , there are the three radio - quiet x - ray point sources that each lie near the center of an snr and have no evidence for a plerion . the x - ray properties of these sources are summarized in table  3 . the x - ray emission from these objects",
    "is well characterized by a bb spectrum with @xmath1500.6 kev and @xmath1513 km , comparable to what we measure in cas  a. from a spectral point of view , these four sources form a remarkably homogeneous group .",
    "pulsations ( @xmath152 ms ) have recently been detected from the source in pks 120952 ( zavlin et al .",
    "2000 ) , and possibly from the source in pup  a ( pavlov , zavlin , & trmper 1999 ) ; in both cases , the measured pulsed fraction is below the limit placed in cas  a. however , the point source in rcw 103 has shown order of magnitude variability in its flux ( gotthelf , petre , & vasisht 1999a ) , with a possible 6  hr periodicity recently reported ( garmire et al .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the cas  a point source , which shows no evidence for strong variability on either short ( @xmath86hours  weeks ; see table 1 ) or long ( @xmath86years ; see pavlov & zavlin 1999 ; pavlov et al .",
    "2000 ) time scales .",
    "at present , we do not have a unique model to account for the observed properties of the x - ray point source in cas  a. thermal emission from an isolated , cooling ns can account for the data , but only if unconventional modifications are incorporated into spectral models in order to satisfy the requirement that the emitting area be small",
    ". localized hot spots can , in principle , be produced on the surface of a ns by horizontal chemical abundance gradients in the liquid envelope ( pavlov et al .",
    "however , such hot spots should give rise to a significant pulsed component to the emission , in general , and such models will likewise be constrained by future limits or detections of x - ray modulation .",
    "accretion onto a bh does not appear promising , but ns accretion provides a viable mechanism for explaining the characteristics of the x - ray emission .",
    "if the ns is very weakly magnetized , the observed emission could arise from a boundary layer .",
    "otherwise , the x - rays could be produced by magnetically - channeled accretion onto the ns . in the latter case",
    ", we expect pulsed emission , so again , future timing limits test this interpretation .    the point source in cas",
    "a is similar in many respects to the axps and quiescent sgrs , which have been interpreted as ultramagnetized neutron stars ( `` magnetars '' ; duncan & thompson 1992 ; thompson & duncan 1996 ; heyl & hernquist 1997a , 1997b ) or as neutron stars with normal magnetic fields of order @xmath153@xmath117 g accreting from fallback disks ( chatterjee et al . 2000 ; alpar 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "it is important to note the detailed thermal emission from neutron stars with magnetic fields @xmath8@xmath9 has yet to be calculated .",
    "conceivably , x - ray spectra in this regime could account for the small emitting areas of the cas  a point source and the axps without requiring small polar hot spots .",
    "regardless of the eventual resolution to the puzzling aspects of the point source in cas  a , it is already clear that the mere existence of this and similar objects demands a dramatic revision of our generally accepted notions of the nature of compact objects found in supernova remnants .",
    "the discovery of radio pulsars in the 1960s led to a paradigm in which supernovae generally leave behind strongly magnetized , rapidly rotating neutron stars . the subsequent failure to locate radio pulsars in the majority of snrs",
    "has been a long - standing problem for this point of view ( kaspi 2000 , gotthelf & vasisht 2000 ) .",
    "the unanticipated properties of the cas  a point source and the relative youth of the cas  a snr imply that the birthrate of `` unusual '' compact objects is likely to be at least roughly comparable to that of radio pulsars , potentially resolving the difficulties posed by snr / pulsar associations . in this sense",
