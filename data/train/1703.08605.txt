    "sid is one of two detectors under consideration for use in the international linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite .",
    "its electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) is a sampling calorimeter constructed of alternating layers of silicon diodes and dens-24 , a tungsten alloy used as an absorber .",
    "the silicon diode pixels individually record charge deposited by particles from the electron - positron collision .",
    "each pixel is individually read out by a kpix chip @xcite .",
    "this document summarizes work done at the university of oregon regarding the response of the kpix readout chip and geometry of the sid ecal .",
    "thirty - one 0.3 mm thick silicon layers are created from a tiling of hexagonal wafers each containing 1024 individual 13 mm@xmath0 pixels . as a photon or electron from the collision passes through the ecal ,",
    "the tungsten layers produce showering .",
    "the silicon layers then measure any charge deposited on them as the shower progresses through the calorimeter .",
    "one kpix readout chip is bump - bonded to the center of each silicon wafer ( fig .",
    "[ wafer ] ) that is connected via channels to each pixel on the chip . in this way ,",
    "measurements from every individual pixel are read out , providing measurements for every 13 mm@xmath0 .",
    "the use of kpix allows for thin sampling layers of 1.25  mm .",
    "prototype versions of silicon wafers mounted with kpix chips were tested at slac national accelerator laboratory in 2013 to test the response of the calorimeter @xcite .",
    "the prototype calorimeter consisted of nine repeated alternating layers of silicon wafers and 2.5 mm dens-24 plates ( fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) , for a total expanse of 5.8 radiation lengths .",

    "c indicating electron events . ]",
    "before the analysis , the beam test data was cleaned .",
    "this cleaning included the removal of  monster events \" , or events in which all pixels unrealistically reported a large amount of deposited charge .",
    "this phenomenon has since been understood .",
    "after the monster events were removed , a large number of low energy events remained from the data set of more than 30,000 events ( fig .",
    "[ testbeamorig ] ) .",
    "these are accompanied by peaks at intervals of 150@xmath2 c , indicating electron events .",
    "the peaks at higher measured charge imply multiple electron events .",
    "many low energy events are soft photon contamination from the electron beam .",
    "setting a higher threshold on the recorded charge would eliminate the consideration of this contamination , but would also neglect low shower - energy electron events . in order to clean out only the contamination ,",
    "an algorithm was designed to categorize showers . in this way , ",
    "photons \" could be separated from ",
    "electron \" showers and eliminated .",
    "a simple categorization technique is to count how many layers of silicon record hits in a given event .",
    "roughly @xmath3 of events only contains hits in one layer .",
    "this type of event is characteristic of soft photon contamination , and can be immediately removed from consideration .",
    "a weighting algorithm was developed to further categorize showers .",
    "the silicon layers were labeled from @xmath4 , with layer one being the first silicon layer the beam encounters .",
    "then , the ratio @xmath5 was calculated , where @xmath6 is the measured charge for a given hit and @xmath7 is the layer number of the hit , summed over all hits @xmath8 . if for some layer there were no hits , a weight of @xmath9 c was inserted .",
    "this is roughly the charge that a minimum ionizing particle would deposit .",
    "position , with a solid line indicating the edge of the wafer .",
    "incident electrons simulated with geant4 mimic this distribution . ]",
    "photon events tend to appear early and only in a few layers of the detector , causing @xmath10 to be small due to the quadratic dependence on layer number .",
    "similarly , electron showers peak later in the detector and drive @xmath10 up .",
    "a cut on @xmath10 was then applied , and events with @xmath10 less than the cut value were disregarded as photon contamination .",
    "after this procedure , nearly @xmath11 of all events from the data set were removed .",
    "the resulting data set ( fig .",
    "[ cleaned ] ) retains low shower - energy electron events while the large photon contamination peak has clearly been removed .",
    "a geant4 simulation was created to model the beam test scenario .",
    "the simulation consisted of 8,000 single electron events transversely distributed in the calorimeter to match the beam test data ( fig .",
    "[ tbposition ] ) .",
    "the collection of single - electron events was then used to create a poisson distribution of multi - electron events by overlaying multiple single - electron events . in order to simulate inactive pixels observed during the beam test ,",
    "@xmath12 of the pixels of each layer were randomly removed .",
    "the resulting data set is shown in fig .",
    "[ simorig ] .",
    "once all runs were normalized to one hundred events , the simulated and collected data agree well ( fig .",
    "[ combo ] ) .",
    "this agreement holds not only for the total measured charge in each event , but for the total measured charge in each layer of the prototype detector of each event as well ( fig .",
    "[ layers ] ) .",
    "the high spatial granularity provided by the silicon pixels and kpix can help distinguish the showers of two nearby particles .",
    "since two - electron events were clearly observed in the beam test prototype run , a study of the prototype s ability to separate showers was done .",
    "an algorithm was created to count the number of incident particles detected in each event .",
    "this algorithm is simple in nature , but robust enough to examine data from both the beam test prototype and geant4 simulation .",
    "it requires inputs that describe the geometry of the silicon wafer , including which pixels border which other pixels , and the charge measured in each pixel .",
    "the algorithm simply examines each layer of each event and determines local maxima of charge deposits .",
    "it then compares the position of this maximum against all other layers , and requires that the same pixel location be a local maximum in at least four layers .",
    "if this condition is met , then an electron event is counted . in this way",
    ", the algorithm can account for multiple electrons occurring within one event but it also biases against late forming showers that do not develop fully enough to create four layers with notable maxima .",
    "occasionally , a shower maximum occurred near the border of two pixels . in this case , the recorded local maximum was equally likely to be located in either pixel .",
    "this fooled the algorithm into tagging two incident particles though there was only truly one .",
    "the counting of more particles than the true number of incident particles is consideredover - counting \" .",
    "the algorithm corrects for this by disallowing the presence of maxima in neighboring pixels .    with simulated data ,",
    "truth information regarding the number of incident electrons is available and the accuracy of the algorithm can be examined . among simulated two - electron events , the algorithm correctly counted 82.6% of events .",
    "17.3% of two - electron simulated events were under - counted ( the algorithm detected less incident particles than there really were ) , meaning that if the algorithm miscounted it was far more likely to under - count than over - count ( fig .",
    "[ 2count ] ) .",
    "when events were incorrectly under - counted , the two electrons tended to be less than 1 cm apart .",
    "the algorithm counted two - electron events with an average efficiency of @xmath13 when the incident electrons were separated by more than 1 cm ( fig .  [ efficiency ] ) .",
    "the algorithm can also analyze data from the beam test prototype , though truth information is unknown .",
    "events the algorithm tags from the beam test data as  two - electron events \" compare appropriately to those that the algorithm tags from the simulated data set ( which can also be compared to simulation truth data ) ( fig .",
    "[ normsep ] ) .",
    "this implies both that the simulation is correctly modeling the system , and that the algorithm can be trusted to identify multi - electron events in prototype data with nearly perfect efficiency provided that incident electrons are separated by more than 1  cm .",
    "the ability to discern multiple electrons incident in similar spatial regions is important for reconstruction of particles using the ecal information - especially the ability to reconstruct boosted @xmath14 mesons from their decay products of two photons .",
    "in the sid design , the ecal barrel sits between the vertex tracker and hadron calorimeter , at an inner radius of 1264  mm from the collision point with a @xmath15 extent of 3.53  m. it is made of twelve trapezoidal modules that extend the full @xmath15 length of the detector with overlapping ends to avoid projective cracks through the detector , creating a structure that is periodic in increments of @xmath16 radians ( fig .",
    "[ geo ] shows the view from the @xmath17 plane with the @xmath15 dimension coming out of the page , also indicates the angle @xmath18 . ) .",
    "these trapezoids have a small inner angle of 30@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "plane with the @xmath15 dimension coming out of the page , also indicates the angle @xmath18 . ]",
    "the region of overlap between two modules spans from @xmath20 $ ] , where @xmath21 is an integer , @xmath22 .",
    "this is approximately 30% of the detector .",
    "each module consists of 31 layers of tiled silicon wafers and 30 layers of dens-24 ( as detailed in section  ii ) .",
    "the first layer of each module is a silicon tracking layer , followed by twenty iterations of 2.5  mm dens-24 and a 1.25  mm gap in which the 0.3  mm silicon layer will reside .",
    "this is followed by ten iterations of 5 mm dens-24 and the same 1.25  mm silicon - containing gap @xcite .",
    "therefore , the ecal begins and ends in a sensitive silicon layer .",
    "this structure is identically repeated for all twelve modules .",
    "the combination of a nontrivial ecal geometry and unequal division of tungsten absorber throughout each module creates complicated calorimeter calibration and geometric effects .",
    "for example , a smaller subset of the overlap region , where @xmath23 $ ] , contains only thin layers of tungsten absorber , and no thicker 5 mm tungsten layers .",
    "this is the  thin overlap region \" .",
    "all the following studies were conducted using the full sid simulation , @xmath24 .",
    "single photons are directed into the detector at various @xmath18 angles incident to the ecal surface ( @xmath25 ) and at initial energies of 10  gev or 100  gev .",
    "only charge deposited in the silicon layers of the ecal barrel is considered .",
    "the overlapping geometry of the ecal barrel creates various effects that must be taken into account in the calorimeter calibration , including a varied absorber depth and number of incident sensitive layers that depend on the angle @xmath18 ( figs .",
    "[ radlenno ] and [ nolay ] ) .     positions . at normal incidence",
    ", there are 26 radiation lengths . ]     positions , excluding the initial silicon tracking layer . at normal incidence , there are 30 silicon layers . ]    to investigate this , 500 events of 100  gev and 10  gev photons were run through the full sid simulation at @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this surveys through one @xmath27 period of the detector , with two points in the overlap region ( @xmath28 ) and one point in the thin overlap region ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the tracking layer of silicon at the beginning of each module is excluded from these studies . in overlap regions ,",
    "this layer falls near the middle of the calorimeter and samples showers before they have traversed a full absorber layer . in this sense ,",
    "the shower is being double - sampled due to the presence of this sensitive layer .    at each @xmath18 angle",
    ", a histogram was made of the total charge measured in the ecal barrel . since the last ten silicon layers follow thicker tungsten layers than the first 20 , deposits in these layers",
    "are weighted by a factor of two to account for the differing sampling fraction .",
    "figure  [ 100gev0phi ] shows an example of 500 events of 100 gev photons with @xmath25 and @xmath30 . the data is fit with a gaussian , giving an average standard deviation of 2.1% of the mean for the 100 gev events .        from analogous distributions for all @xmath18 angles ,",
    "the mean value from the gaussian fit was recorded and plotted as a function of @xmath18 with error bars representing the standard deviation .",
    "this was done for 100 gev initial photon energies and 10 gev initial photon energies ( where the mean energies of the 10 gev runs are scaled up by a factor of ten to compare to the 100 gev runs ) ( fig .",
    "[ survey ] ) .    , or the angle around the sid ecal .",
    "error bars indicate the standard deviation that also supplied the plotted mean values . ]    .",
    "the higher energy 100  gev photons experience more leakage into the hadron calorimeter . ]    the standard distribution of measured charge remains fairly constant throughout the entire @xmath18 range , with standard deviations of 100 gev and 10 gev runs in the range of 2.0%  -  2.3% and 5.7%  -  6.6% of the mean , respectively .",
    "this is seen even in the overlap region of @xmath31 $ ] where the showers experience higher sampling rates ( see fig .  [ nolay ] ) .",
    "the 10 gev runs , once scaled up by a factor of ten , have a slightly higher mean than the 100 gev run due to lower leakage into the hadron calorimeter ( fig .  [ hcal ] ) .",
    "deposits in the hadron calorimeter notably see an increase in measured charge of more than @xmath32 in the overlap region of the ecal .",
    "this is due to the lower total radiation lengths within the this region ( fig .",
    "[ radlenno ] ) , where the number of radiation lengths decreases from @xmath33 at normal incidence to a minimum of @xmath34 at @xmath35 .",
    "these effects are currently under investigation at the university of oregon , as effort continues to optimize the sid ecal design from first principles and to formulate calibration constants that include energy- and angular - dependence .",
