    "low - mass stars form from the gravitational collapse of dense molecular cloud cores . in the earliest stages ,",
    "the young protostar is deeply embedded in a cold envelope of infalling gas ( the so - called  class 0  stage ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "studies of the deeply embedded stages reveal the properties of the youngest stellar objects during or just after formation of the star .",
    "an interesting interplay takes place in these earliest stages between material falling toward the central star - disk system and that being dispersed by a protostellar outflow while simultaneously being heated by radiation from the central star .",
    "this paper presents a large survey of 8 deeply embedded protostars with 13  ( @xmath9  au ) resolution in a wide range of line and continuum emission at submillimeter wavelengths using the submillimeter array ( sma ) .",
    "these observations are ideally suited to probe the inner warm and dense material surrounding low - mass protostars , in contrast with lower frequency data which are more sensitive to the cold outer envelope .",
    "combined studies of the physical and chemical structure of low - mass protostars are important for a complete picture of the evolution of young stellar objects , for understanding their structure on few hundred au scales and for addressing a number of questions about low - mass star formation .",
    "for example , do all deeply embedded protostars have disks ?",
    "how massive are these disks , both compared to their envelopes and to the disks around the more evolved t tauri stars ?",
    "is there evidence that their physical properties and composition ( e.g. , the properties of the dust of which they are made ) are different from those of their more evolved counterparts ?",
    "what are the time scales for the dissipation of the protostellar envelopes ?",
    "how important are protostellar outflows for the dissipation , e.g. , compared to the amount of material accreted onto the central star+disk system ?",
    "likewise , what is the importance of shocks associated with the outflows in regulating the chemistry in the protostellar envelopes ?",
    "are complex organic molecules common in these envelopes and do they originate in shocks or due to heating by the central protostar ?    observations at ( sub)millimeter wavelengths can address a number of these issues : thermal dust continuum emission can be used to constrain the envelope density and temperature structure whereas line observations give information about the dynamical structure ( e.g. , of the infalling material ) , of excitation conditions and of the chemistry . submillimeter dust emission and high - excitation lines constrain the properties of the actual protostellar envelope and are less sensitive to the surrounding cloud material than , e.g. , observations from high - resolution 3  mm studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "previously such submillimeter observations were only feasible with single - dish telescopes with resolutions of a few thousand au for nearby star forming regions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) . with the submillimeter array @xcite ,",
    "however , a new window has opened up , allowing for detailed studies of the radial variations of both the physical / dynamical and chemical structure of protostellar cores .",
    "the sma is ideal for studies of these inner regions for a number of reasons : first , previous interferometric studies based on lower excitation lines did not probe deeply inside the envelope since these lines are sensitive to the chemistry of the outer , cold regions and become optically thick . in the 325365  ghz window",
    "a wealth of molecular transitions constrain the chemistry in the denser ( @xmath10  @xmath11 ) and warmer ( @xmath12  k ) material of the envelope .",
    "second , since the dust continuum flux scales with frequency as @xmath13 or steeper , submillimeter observations are well suited to probe the dust in protostellar disks . at the same time , the innermost regions of the envelopes where the temperature increases above 100  k are heavily diluted in a single - dish beam ( @xmath14 size compared to typical single - dish beam sizes of 10 - 20@xmath3 ) .",
    "third , interpretation of the line emission from these regions relies on extrapolation of the density and temperature distribution from observations on larger scales .",
    "typical sma observations resolve the emission down to these scales and make it possible to disentangle the emission from the envelope and circumstellar disk .",
    "a number of recent papers have presented studies of individual protostars with the sma that focused on different aspects of the physical and chemical structure of protostellar envelopes , disks and outflows @xcite . to make statistical comparisons and general statements about the deeply embedded protostars as a whole , however , the systematic effort described here is warranted .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to describe the details of the observations and present an overview of the results with a few pointers to important implications .",
    "the observational details , including the sample , observed settings , reduction and calibration strategy , are presented and discussed in  [ obs ] . in ",
    "[ contresults ] , the results of the continuum observations are discussed with simple estimates of the compact emission from the central disks , their masses and the slope of the dust opacity law .",
    "the line observations are discussed in  [ lineresults ] , showing all observed maps and addressing which molecular species are particularly useful for probing different aspects of the protostellar cores , and focusing on the dynamical and chemical impact of the protostellar outflows .",
    "finally ,  [ summary ] concludes the paper .",
    "this paper serves as a starting point for a series of focused papers that will describe more specific topics in detail and will serve as an important reference for planning future sma ( and eventual alma ) observations of low - mass protostars .",
    "the sources observed in this program were selected from a large single - dish survey of submillimeter continuum and line emission toward low - mass protostars @xcite .",
    "that sample consisted of nearby ( @xmath15  pc ) class  0 objects with luminosities less than @xmath16 - all visible from mauna kea ( i.e. , predominantly northern sources ) .",
    "for this study we selected a subset of 7 objects that , in addition to the above single - dish survey , have been studied extensively through aperture synthesis observations at 3  millimeter wavelengths . to this we added the class 0 object b335 which likewise has been studied in great detail using ( sub)millimeter single - dish telescopes @xcite , through longer wavelength aperture synthesis observations @xcite , at near - ir wavelengths @xcite , and using detailed dust and line radiative transfer @xcite",

    "* ) and in addition single - dish maps have been obtained for a subset of the lines which will be incorporated in forthcoming papers . the full sample of objects is summarized in table  [ sample ] . in appendix",

    "it is also seen that the sources which are observed with the shortest possible baselines in the compact configuration show stronger emission in some of the prominent lines : for example , strong c@xmath24o 32 emission is detected in l1157 whereas it does not show particularly strong c@xmath24o 32 lines compared to the other sources in the survey of @xcite .",
    "again , this likely reflects that most of the c@xmath24o 32 emission seen in the single - dish observations comes from the extended envelope and thus is very sensitive to the differences in the lengths of the shortest baselines .",
    "the amount of resolving out for a somewhat extended molecular species is estimated by comparison to the single - dish observations of c@xmath23o 21 by @xcite ( for b335 , cso observations presented by @xcite were used ) .",
    "the integrated line intensities from the single - dish observations are converted from antenna temperature scales to jy  beam@xmath18 using the standard expressions and compared to the central spectra from either the interferometer datasets restored with a beam size comparable to the single - dish beam size ( in cases where the signal - to - noise is sufficient ) or the flux integrated over a smaller region where the emission was detected . for c@xmath23o 21",
    "the amount of flux recovered by the interferometer estimated in this way varies from 13% for l1448 , iras2a , iras4b , l1527 and l483 , about 6% for iras4a to 16% and 22% for l1157 and b335 , respectively .",
    "the slightly higher amount of recovered emission in iras4a ( compared to the other sources observed in the compact - north configuration ) and vice versa the slightly lower amount of recovered emission in l483 ( compared to the sources observed in the compact configuration ) are nice examples of the importance of source structure .",
    "iras4a has significant structure within the single - dish beam , in particular by the two binary components well separated by the interferometer and each contributing to the total flux , whereas l483 typically shows a more smooth distribution of its emission over larger scales .",
    "still , since only 1520% of the emission is recovered even in the best cases of b335 and l1157 , it is clear that care must be taken when interpreting the interferometric data .",
    "it is , for example , not possible to deduce quantitative information from the integrated line fluxes without compensating for the lack of short spacing data .",
    "two sources , iras4a and iras4b , show characteristic `` inverse p cygni '' line profiles where the red - shifted part of the lines is seen in absorption against the continuum while the blue - shifted part is seen in emission .",
    "such profiles can be taken as the least ambiguous evidence for infall in protostellar cores where the foreground material falling toward the central source ( red - shifted ) is absorbing the continuum emission .",
    "inverse p cygni profiles have been seen previously in lines of h@xmath1co and cs toward iras4a and iras4b in iram plateau de bure observations by @xcite . with the sma operating at submillimeter wavelengths ( and therefore measuring stronger continuum emission and high excitation lines )",
    ", it should be ideally suited for detecting such line profiles .",
    "of all the lines in the sample , only the @xmath8co 21 lines toward iras4a and iras4b show clear inverse p cygni profiles ( figure  [ pcyg_spectra ] ) .",
    "together with iras  16293 - 2422 @xcite , these sources provide the only known examples of inverse p cygni profiles toward low - mass protostars .",
    "it could suggest that the observed inverse p cygni profiles are related to much larger scale infalling motions such as those seen in single - dish observations of iras4 by @xcite rather than collapse onto the central protostar .",
    "the 230  ghz continuum emission toward iras4a is marginally resolved between the two components of the binary and no significant difference is seen between the widths of the absorption across the continuum possibly arguing in favor of the presence of more global collapsing motions .",
    "of all the lines in the survey , the co 21 lines provide the most striking features , showing extended outflow emission over most of the sma primary beam ( figure  [ co_maps ] ) .",
    "the co emission has significant differences , from the highly collimated iras4b outflow to the somewhat more diffuse l483 , l1527 and b335 outflows .",
    "the close binarity of iras2a and iras4a is also seen in the co maps causing more confusing pictures of those outflows .",
    "iras2a for example shows hints of both a prominent north - south cone - shaped outflow and a more collimated east - west jet ( see also discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for l1448 , iras2a and l1157 , the co emission is seen to delineate the edges of the outflow cavities .",
    "it should be emphasized that some of the differences between outflows in this sample could be due to inclination effects .",
    "a highly collimated outflow directed in the plane of the sky will have small relative co velocities over the extent of the outflow and its co emission will be more susceptible to resolving out as it merges with the surrounding cloud material .",
    "l1527 shows a `` butterfly '' shape in lower-@xmath30 co and hco@xmath0 lines @xcite , suggesting that inclination is significant there .",
    "likewise , an outflow with a large opening angle viewed at an inclination close to the opening of the outflow cones will show both red- and blue - shifted emission overlapping in both lobes , which has been shown to be the case for b335 @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite imaged a sample of nine class 0 , i and ii young stellar objects in the @xmath21co 1 - 0 line observed with the owens valley radio observatory millimeter array .",
    "they found that outflow opening angles are a good discriminant between the different evolutionary stages of the objects and suggested that it reflects that the material in the protostellar envelope is cleared as the outflow opens up an increasingly wide cavity .",
    "a similar suggestion has been put forward by @xcite .",
    "all of the outflows in our sample are found to have small opening angles ( @xmath31 ) , further supporting the conclusion of @xcite that the outflows with the narrowest opening angles belong to the class 0 objects . the individual outflows in our sample share many of the features with the three different class 0 outflows in the sample of @xcite , ranging from the jet - like iras4b , iras4a2 and iras2a ( east - west ) outflows ( similar to the hh114-mms outflow from the sample of @xcite ) , to the more cone - like l1448 , iras2a ( north - south ) , b335 and l1157 outflows ( similar to the iras  03282 + 3035 outflow in the @xcite sample ) .",
    "in addition the diffuse l483 and l1527 outflows appear more similar to the class i outflows in the sample of @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that no significant changes in the shape of the cone is seen for the observed outflows all the way to the few hundred au scales probed by the sma observations , in contrast with what is expected if the outflow angle increases over the duration of the class 0 stage .",
    "that is , the outflows do not show a parabolic shape reflecting a larger opening angle close to the central protostar compared to material further away - in contrast to what is seen in the perhaps best example of this scenario in b5-irs1 @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the most collimated outflows ( iras4a and iras4b ) are related to the objects with the highest ratios of disk to envelope masses from the continuum studies while the objects with the lowest disk masses compared to envelope masses ( l1527 and l483 ) show the most diffuse outflows .",
    "this may seem a disparity ; in a simple picture of envelope material falling into a circumstellar disk and accreting onto the central protostar , the mass of the disk is expected to increase until the envelope has dissipated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one would therefore expect that the more evolved ( still embedded ) objects would have the highest disk - to - envelope mass ratios in contrast to what is observed here .",
    "the question is whether l483 and l1527 still will accrete significant material from the currently observed dust envelope . as pointed out in ",
    "[ cont_morph ] , both show very flat density profiles from the scuba maps , which could reflect the importance of heating of the protostellar envelopes through their outflow cavities .",
    "indeed , both sources show near - infrared scattering nebulosities ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , supporting the view that their envelopes are being heated at larger scales . the high angular resolution n@xmath1h@xmath0 observations of l483 by @xcite furthermore indicate a velocity gradient in the larger scale quiescent envelope material in the direction of the outflow , likely reflecting that the envelope indeed is being dispersed by the action of the outflow .",
    "it is therefore plausible that l1527 and l483 in particular , are in a phase where the accretion has more or less come to a stop - and the protostar just is `` waiting '' to disperse its remaining envelope through the action of the outflow .",
    "the relatively large disk masses of the remaining objects could imply that they also are close to the maximum disk masses - but comparisons to both disk and envelope structures of more evolved class i objects are needed to confirm or refute this . also , firmer constraints on both disk structures and outflow parameters for these sources will be important to obtain a more quantitative picture of the dynamical properties of the envelope and disk material .",
    "another example of the importance of the outflows is most clearly seen in the chemical differentiation toward some of the sources . for iras4b , for example ,",
    "a number of lines show emission separated into clumps about 6  ( 1500  au ) north / south of the central protostar , prominently seen in cs , ch@xmath2oh and h@xmath1co . these species are found to be located on the tips of the co outflows and likely probe shocks where the outflow impacts the envelope . in iras4a , characteristic shocks",
    "( although less prominent than in iras4b ) are seen north and south in the outflow associated with the northwestern binary component , iras4a - nw ( iras4a2 ) .",
    "fainter compact emission is also seen toward the center of this source ; interestingly , this emission appears to be red - shifted with respect to the systemic velocity , also suggesting an outflow impact on the smallest scales .",
    "the shock - tracing sio and so emission also peak away from the central protostars in iras4a and iras4b , although only a very tentative sio emission is observed toward iras4a . for three other sources in the sample ,",
    "compact ch@xmath2oh emission is seen , most prominently in iras2a .",
    "in contrast to the two other sources in ngc  1333 , a number of high excitation transitions are observed in the ch@xmath2oh @xmath29 band toward this source .",
    "this is indicative of the presence of hot gas on small scales in iras2a , consistent with the conclusion of @xcite who imaged even higher excitation ch@xmath2oh transitions also with the sma .",
    "the three sources in ngc  1333 ( iras2a , iras4a and iras4b ) have all been suggested to have `` hot corinos '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. , inner regions where the temperature increases above 100  k due to passive heating by the protostar and where complex organic molecules are produced into the gas - phase as ice mantles evaporate .",
    "this was in particular inferred from multi - transition observations of h@xmath1co and ch@xmath2oh which in some cases could not be fit by constant abundances .",
    "@xcite discussed these single - dish observations in context of the hot corino scenario and found that these sources required an abundance enhancement by up to four orders of magnitude in the innermost regions .",
    "@xcite on the other hand demonstrated that those abundance enhancements in most cases were a result of specific assumptions , e.g. , about the ratio between the abundances ortho- and para - h@xmath1co .",
    "furthermore , shocks caused by the outflows can enhance the abundances of these species on larger scales which further complicates the interpretation of hot corinos : @xcite , for example , found that the h@xmath1co and ch@xmath2oh abundance variations in iras4b were best explained by a scenario in which the molecules were released in the outflow driven shocks , further supported by the line profiles of these species and high excitation cs 109 lines .    to properly address these issues high angular resolution observations are clearly important , e.g. , to directly image where molecular species have their origin .",
    "@xcite for example demonstrated that the emission of so toward the inner few arcseconds of the class 0 source iras  16293 - 2422 was enhanced by the action of the outflow also traced by centimeter continuum emission and h@xmath1o maser activity .",
    "more recently , @xcite resolved the emission of complex organic species , ch@xmath2cn and hcooch@xmath2 , toward this source and derived a size of @xmath32  au , comparable to the expected size of the hot corino .",
    "@xcite on the other hand found that the emission of high excitation transitions and complex organic molecules toward this source was shifted by a few tenths of an arcsecond ( @xmath33  au ) coinciding with the shock seen in longer wavelength continuum observations .",
    "the sma observations presented in this paper indicates that the peaks in the ch@xmath2oh and h@xmath1co emission toward iras4a - nw and iras4b are related to the shocks and that no trace of compact emission from these species is seen toward the central continuum sources , in contrast to what should be expected in the case of hot corinos .",
    "we note that also for these transitions the sma resolve out a significant fraction ( 5075% ) of the observed single - dish flux indicating that h@xmath1co and ch@xmath2oh are present in the large scale envelopes .",
    "iras2a still stands out with compact hot gas as witnessed , e.g. , by the detection of many of the higher excitation hyperfine components of the @xmath34 line ( fig .",
    "[ ch3oh_spectra ] and higher @xmath30 ch@xmath2oh lines @xcite that appear unresolved . of the well - studied low - mass protostars ,",
    "iras2 therefore appears to be the best hot corino candidate .",
    "given the importance of outflows in the other low - mass sources where complex organic molecules have been observed , however , it is a valid question to ask whether the protostellar outflow is important on these small scales in iras2a , where it is still unresolved by the sma observations ( similar to the case of iras  16293 - 2422 ) .",
    "the so emission do show evidence of a velocity gradient which could suggest that the shocks are impacting the material on small scales toward iras2a .",
    "also , it is possible that accretion shocks in the disk could temporarily heat the gas in the surface layer to high temperatures and likewise inject complex molecules from the ice mantles into the gas - phase . in iras2a in particular",
    ", this seems to be a feasible scenario , given the extent of the disk from submillimeter continuum data ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "again , further high - resolution line observations could potentially disentangle the velocity field of the disk and further address its physical properties ( temperature , density ) and chemical structure .",
    "this discussion directly illustrates the importance of high - angular resolution imaging for the interpretation of chemical variations in protostellar environments . with the high - resolution sma observations , it becomes possible to image directly these physical and chemical variations in the immediate vicinity of the low - mass protostars",
    "a large line and continuum survey with the submillimeter array of 8 deeply embedded , low - mass protostellar cores has been presented .",
    "each source has been observed in three different spectral settings that included lines of the most common molecular species , co , hco@xmath0 , cs , so , h@xmath1co , ch@xmath2oh and sio . emission from ( sub)millimeter lines from 11 molecular species ( including isotopologues ) have been imaged at high angular resolution ( 1@xmath33@xmath3 ; typically corresponding to 200600  au ) together with continuum emission at 230 ( 1.3  mm ) and 345  ghz ( 0.8  mm ) .",
    "a number of conclusions can be inferred from simple considerations of this dataset :    * compact continuum emission is observed for all sources . comparing the 230  ghz and 345  ghz data ,",
    "the emission is found to be well described as @xmath35 with an average value of @xmath36 of 2.4 .",
    "@xmath37 was only found for one source , l483 . for this source ,",
    "the compact continuum emission is weak at 230  ghz and the emission comes from the envelope rather than the circumstellar disk . for the remaining sources , the continuum emission likely originates in the disks being marginally optically thick and having dust opacities , @xmath38 with @xmath7 .",
    "lower limits to the total disk masses ( gas+dust ) are found to be typically 0.1  @xmath5 for a dust temperature of 30  k ( 110% of their envelope masses ) . *",
    "inverse p cygni profiles indicative of infalling motions are seen in the @xmath8co 21 lines toward iras4a and iras4b .",
    "these are not observed in other lines or toward other sources ( besides iras  16293 - 2422 ) , however , and it is possible that these profiles have their origin in the ambient cloud / outer envelope rather than infall in the inner envelope themselves .",
    "* prominent outflows are present in all sources extending over most of the interferometer field of view .",
    "most of the outflows show small opening angles @xmath31 comparable to other previously studied class 0 objects - and in agreement with the suggestion that the outflow opening angle increases with time @xcite .",
    "still , significant differences are seen in their morphologies with some outflows showing more jet - like structure and others seemingly tracing material in the outflow cavity walls .",
    "the most diffuse outflows are found for the objects with the lowest ratios of disk - to - envelope masses , in particular l1527 and l483 , which are thought to be transitionary between the class 0 and i stages .",
    "it is suggested that these sources have reached the end of their main accretion and that the remaining envelope material will be dispersed by the outflows .",

    "compact red - shifted ch@xmath2oh emission is seen toward one of the components of the iras4a binary , iras4a - nw ( iras4a2 ) .",
    "these observations suggest that the emission of h@xmath1co and ch@xmath2oh , often taken as signposts of low - mass `` hot corinos '' , are in fact related to the shocks caused by the protostellar outflows . in this context ,",
    "iras2a stands out as the only source with clear evidence for hot , compact gas ( as also seen in previous sma observations by @xcite ) .",
    "further high resolution observations will be necessary to ascertain whether this emission is related to a passively heated hot corino , a shock in the circumstellar disk or perhaps just the action of the outflow on the smallest scales .",
    "it is clear that these high - resolution observations pushes our understanding of embedded protostars as simple and quiescent structures toward a more dynamic picture .",

    "iras2b is located outside the primary beam field of view at a separation of 30@xmath3 ( 7500  au ) , but is detected in the 1.3  mm maps presented here .",
    "iras2a itself has been speculated to be a protostellar binary , resulting in its characteristic quadrupolar outflow ( see also  [ cooutflow ] ) . at 0.8  mm",
    ", it appears to be resolved into two separate components with a fainter companion northeast of the main peak , but as for l1448 above , it is not clear whether this is simply a result of resolving out differing amounts of envelope material .",
    "@xcite examined sma continuum observations from iras2a and showed that the emission could be explained by a combination of an extended envelope and a 300  au diameter disk .",
    "ngc  1333-iras4a ( together with its companion iras4b ; both well - separated in scuba maps ) is one of the most well - studied protostellar systems in ngc  1333 .",

    "the outflow in iras4b appears to play an important role of 510  scales affecting the emission of a number of molecular species .",
    "@xcite for example found that the abundance variations of h@xmath1co and ch@xmath2oh deduced from single - dish observations best were explained by the impact of this outflow - also accounting for the line profiles of these species and high excitation cs 109 emission detected toward this source .",

    "no evidence is found of this secondary in the previous high resolution 3  mm maps or in the maps presented here , however ( it would be located outside the primary beam field of view at 345  ghz , but inside at 230  ghz ) .",
    "the scuba maps show a very extended core with little central concentration ( a flat envelope density profile @xmath43 with @xmath44 is found for this source @xcite whereas most of the other protostars have steeper profiles with @xmath45 ) .",

    "it has been imaged at high resolution in continuum and lines at 3  mm with the berkeley maryland illinois association ( bima ) millimeter array @xcite and ovro mma @xcite . in the analysis of the continuum emission @xcite found that all the detected continuum emission could be attributed to the extended envelope , contrasting l483-fir from l1448-c and ngc  1333-iras2a described above where a compact continuum source was present .",
    "@xcite recently mapped l483-mm in the hcn 43 transition at submillimeter wavelengths using the aste single - dish telescope .",
    "they found that the hcn emission was slightly extended , which they argued is reflecting the heating of the envelope material to 4000 au scales through the outflow cavity .",
    "b335 has often been considered one of the best protostellar collapse candidates .",
    "it has been imaged in continuum at subarcsecond resolution @xcite and in lines @xcite .",

    "@xcite showed that the line emission thought to trace the collapse were in fact dominated by a number of clumps extending along the outflow cavity into the low density medium .",
