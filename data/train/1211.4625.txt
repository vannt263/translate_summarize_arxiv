    "traffic signal is an essential element to the management of the transportation network . for the past several decades ,",
    "signal control strategies have evolved from ones developed based on historical information , often referred to as the fixed timing plan , to the generation of control strategies in which the control system is fully responsive . in the latter case ,",
    "the cycle lengths and splits of the signal are determined based on real - time information .",
    "representatives of such signal - control systems are opac @xcite , rhodes @xcite , scat @xcite and scoot @xcite .",
    "the performance of a traffic signal control system depends on the optimization procedure embedded therein .",
    "we distinguish between two optimization procedures : 1 ) heuristic approach , such as those developed with feedback control , genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic ; and 2 ) exact approach , such as those arising from mathematical control theory and mathematical programming . among these exact approaches ,",
    "the _ mixed integer programs _",
    "( mips ) are of particular interest and has been used extensively in the signal control literature .",
    "@xcite formulated the traffic signal control problem for a single road junction as a mixed binary integer program . @xcite and",
    "@xcite employed the _ cell transmission model _ ( ctm ) @xcite and casted a signal control problem as mixed integer linear program . in these papers , the author addressed time - varying traffic patterns and dynamic timing plan . in @xcite ,",
    "the same formulation based on ctm was applied to capture more realistic features of signalized junctions such as the total number of vehicle stops and signal preemption in the presence of emergency vehicles .",
    "one subtle issue associated with ctm - based mathematical programs is the phenomena known as traffic holding , which stem from the linear relaxation of the nonlinear dynamic .",
    "such an action induces the unintended holding of vehicles , i.e. , a vehicle is held at a cell even though there is capacity available downstream for the vehicle to advance .",
    "the traffic holding can be avoided by introducing additional binary variables , see @xcite .",
    "however , this approach ends up with a substantial amount of binary variables and yields the program computationally demanding .",
    "an alternative way to treat holding problem is to manipulate the objective function such that the optimization mechanism enforces the full utilization of available capacities in the network .",
    "this approach however , strongly depends on specific structure of the problem and the underlying optimization procedure . specific discussion on traffic holding can be found in @xcite    this paper presents a novel milp formulation for signal control problem based on the _ link - based kinematic wave model _ ( lkwm ) .",
    "this model was proposed in @xcite as a continuous - time extension of the lighthill - whitham - richards ( lwr ) model @xcite to networks .",
    "this model describes network dynamics with variables associated to the entrance and exit of each link .",
    "it employs a newell - type variational argument @xcite to capture shock waves and vehicle spillback .",
    "analytical properties of this model pertaining to solution existence , uniqueness and well - posedness are provided in @xcite .",
    "a discrete - time version of the lkwm , known as the _ link transmission model _ , was discussed in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the cell - based math programming approaches where the variables of interest correspond to each cell and each time interval , the model proposed in this paper is link - based , i.e. the variables are associated with each link and each time interval .",
    "the resulting milp thus substantially reduces the number of ( binary ) variables and hence the computational effort .",
    "in addition , the link - based approach prevents vehicle holding within a link without using binary variables .",
    "the resulting mixed integer linear program can be solved efficiently with commercial optimizers such as cplex .",
    "the formulation in this paper captures key phenomena of vehicular flow at junctions such as the formation , propagation and dissipation of physical queues , spill back and vehicle turning .",
    "it also considers important features of signal control such as dynamic timing plan and time - varying flow patterns . in the remainder of this introduction",
    ", we briefly review the lwr model and the variational method for solving the corresponding hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "this will serve as preliminary background as we proceed in section [ llwr ] to discuss our link - based network mode .      following the classical model introduced by @xcite and @xcite , we model the traffic dynamics on a link with the following first order _ partial differential equation _ ( pde ) , which describes the spatial - temporal evolution of density and flow @xmath0 where @xmath1\\rightarrow [ 0,\\,\\rho_{j}]$ ] is average vehicle density , @xmath2\\rightarrow [ 0,\\,c]$ ] is average flow . @xmath3 is jam density , @xmath4 is flow capacity .",
    "the function @xmath5 articulates a density - flow relation and is commonly referred to as the fundamental diagram .",
    "classical mathematical results on the first - order hyperbolic equations of the form ( [ lwrpde ] ) can be found in @xcite . for a detailed discussion of numerical schemes for conservation laws ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite . a well - known discrete version of the lwr model , the cell transmission model ( ctm ) , was introduced by @xcite .",
    "pde - based models have been studied extensively also in the context of vehicular networks , with a list of selected references including @xcite .",
    "initially introduced by @xcite , then extended in @xcite and @xcite , and applied to traffic theory in @xcite , the lax - hopf formula provides a new characterization of the solution to the hyperbolic conservation law and hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "the lax formula is derived from the characteristics equations associated with the h - j equation , which arises in the classical calculus of variations and mathematical mechanics .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "let us introduce the function @xmath6\\rightarrow \\mathbb{r}$ ] , such that @xmath7 the function @xmath8 is sometimes referred to as moskowitz function or newell - curves .",
    "it has been studied extensively , in @xcite .",
    "a well - known property of @xmath9 is that it satisfies the following hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath10\\ ] ]    let @xmath11 be a subset of @xmath12 $ ] , and @xmath13 be a value condition which prescribes the value of @xmath9 on @xmath11 .",
    "the solution to the h - j equation ( [ hjeqn ] ) with condition @xmath14 is given by the lax - hopf formula @xcite .",
    "@xmath15    such that @xmath16 $ ] , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "where @xmath19 is the legendre ( concave ) transformation of @xmath5 .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follow . in section [ llwr ] , we present a network model known as the link - based kinematic wave model @xcite .",
    "section [ sects ] formulates the traffic signal control problem in both continuous- and discrete - time , based on the lkwm .",
    "the discrete - time problem is further formulated as a mixed integer linear program .",
    "section [ secne ] presents a numerical example , which demonstrates and evaluates the proposed formulation .",
    "in this section , we present a kinematic wave model on networks , with a triangular fundamental diagram for each link . unlike the cell - based models @xcite , the proposed model does not require modeling or computation in the interior of the link .",
    "for this reason , we call it the link - based kinematic wave model .      consider the link represented by an interval @xmath20 $ ] , with @xmath21 . in the derivation of the lkwm , we select flow @xmath22 and regime @xmath23 as the state variables for the link , instead of density .",
    "it is obvious that a single value of @xmath24 corresponds to two traffic states : 1 ) the free flow phase ( @xmath25 ) ; and 2 ) the congested phase ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "therefore , the pair @xmath27\\times \\{0,\\,1\\}$ ] determines a unique density value .",
    "this simple observation gives rise to the following map @xmath28\\times \\{0,\\,1\\}~\\rightarrow ~ [ 0,\\,\\rho^{jam}],\\qquad ( q,\\,r)\\mapsto \\rho\\ ] ]      extension of the kinematic wave model to a network turns out to be subtle ; the issues associated therein are 1 ) a proper definition of a weak entropy solution at a junction of arbitrary topology ; 2 ) uniqueness and well - posedness of the entropy solution .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for some specific discussion .",
    "a junction model can be analyzed by considering a riemann problem , which is an initial value problem with constant datum on each incoming and outgoing link .",
    "due to space limitation , instead of a comprehensive discussion on various types of riemann problems , we focus on the riemann problem for a particular junction , that is , the one with one incoming link and @xmath29 outgoing links . this is because we assume that during one signal phase , cars from only one incoming link can enter the junction .    in order to model vehicle turning , we fix a traffic distribution matrix @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath33 determines how the traffic from the incoming link @xmath34 distributes in percentages to the outgoing link @xmath35 . for simplicity , we assume @xmath36 is time - independent . note that there is no substantial difficulty with transforming our modeling framework to deal with time - varying distribution matrices ; such extension , however , requires additional information on route choices , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the next theorem characterizes the solution to the riemann problem at junction with one incoming link .",
    "[ thm1 ] consider a junction with one incoming link @xmath34 and @xmath29 outgoing links @xmath37 .",
    "for every initial data @xmath38\\times \\{0,\\,1\\}$ ] , there exists a unique @xmath39-tuple @xmath40\\times \\{0,\\,1\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 , such that the solutions to the initial - boundary value problems at the junction @xmath42 is the admissible weak solution to the junction problem in the sense defined in @xcite . in addition , we have the following characterization : the boundary states @xmath43 are given by    @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    @xmath47    where @xmath48    the quantity @xmath49 is the maximum flux an incoming ( outgoing ) link can send ( receive )  a quantity identified as demand ( supply ) by @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned map @xmath50 is commonly referred to as the riemann solver , see @xcite for a formal discussion .",
    "theorem [ thm1 ] describes the riemann solver using the new state variables @xmath24 and @xmath51 .",
    "the verification of theorem [ thm1 ] is straightforward . for junctions with arbitrary topology ,",
    "the riemann solvers are not available in closed - form . yet , in the case of one incoming link , we are able to express the riemann solver explicitly .    in the next subsection ,",
    "we analyze shock formation and propagation within one single link .",
    "the location of the shock wave is crucial as it determines the regime variable @xmath51 associated with the two boundaries of the link .",
    "we focus on solutions generated by assuming an initially empty network , i.e. @xmath52 . the key to our analysis is the location of a so - called _ separating shock _ , which divides each link into two zones : free flow zone @xmath53 , and congested zone @xmath54 .",
    "we begin with the fact that if the network is initially empty , then there can be at most one separating shock on each link    [ sshocklemma ] for every link @xmath35 and any solution @xmath55 with @xmath56 , the following statement holds :    1 .   for every @xmath57 , there exists at most one @xmath58 such that @xmath59 2 .",
    "for all @xmath60 $ ] , @xmath61    see @xcite .    according to lemma [ sshocklemma ] , the separating shock emerges from the downstream boundary @xmath62 of the link , and propagates towards the interior of the link .",
    "the speed of this separating shock is given by the rankine - hugoniot condition @xcite .",
    "it is clear that as long as the separating shock remains in the interior of the link @xmath35 , the upstream and downstream boundary conditions do not interact .",
    "thus the exit of a link remains in the congested phase ; while the entrance remains in the free flow phase .",
    "consequently , the riemann solver in theorem [ thm1 ] is expressed entirely with exogenous parameters @xmath63 and @xmath33 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the separating shock reaches either boundary , it becomes a latent shock .",
    "two cases may arise .",
    "\\i ) the the shock reaches the exit , i.e. @xmath64 . in this case , the current link is dominated by free flow phase .",
    "the boundary condition at @xmath65 directly influences the boundary condition at @xmath66 , in a way expressed by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the length of the link , @xmath69 is the speed of forward wave propagation .",
    "see figure [ figextreme ] for an illustration .",
    "\\ii ) the shock reaches the entrance , i.e. @xmath70 . in this case , the current link is dominated by congested phase .",
    "the boundary condition at @xmath66 directly affects the boundary condition at @xmath65 @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the speed of backward wave propagation .        in either case , the riemann solver involves boundary flows ( [ caseii ] ) , ( [ casei ] ) , which are endogenous .",
    "the next key step towards the link - based flow model is the detection of these two extreme cases .",
    "this can be done with the lax - hopf formula .",
    "this section provides sufficient and necessary condition for the occurrence of the latent shock .",
    "the derivation is omitted for brevity , we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "define for each link @xmath35 the cumulative entering and exiting vehicle numbers @xmath73    recall that the separating shock @xmath74 $ ] is a continuous curve in the @xmath75 domain .",

    "then for all @xmath57 , @xmath79    the significance of criteria ( [ latent3])-([latent4 ] ) is that the two extreme cases can be detected without any computation within the link .",
    "this is because @xmath80 , @xmath81 are determined completely by the boundary flows .",
    "theorem [ thmdetection ] is the key ingredient of the lkwm , which allows the network model to be solved at the link level .",
    "analytical properties of the lkwm pertaining to solution existence , uniqueness and well - posedness are provided in @xcite .",

    "in this section , we consider the simple network consisting of two junctions , as shown in figure [ fignetwork ] . we will show the numerical result of optimal signal control at this junction obtained by the milp summarized in the previous section .",
