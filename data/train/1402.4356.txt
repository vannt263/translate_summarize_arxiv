    "an essential and characteristic property of laser light , observed since its first generation , is its extraordinary coherence and frequency stability well below the width of the optical resonator used . far above threshold the linewidth is limited by technical noise of the gain medium and the mirrors only .",
    "continuous technological advances have brought this limit down to an incredible stability below the hz - level  @xcite , which competes against the @xmath0 and the linewidth of long lived atomic clock states . at this point , further technological improvements seem extremely challenging . therefore , it has been suggested recently  @xcite and to some extent demonstrated experimentally  @xcite that an atomic clock transition could be used as a narrow band gain medium to run a laser .",
    "due to the very feeble individual dipole moments of the atoms such a device can only be operated in the strong collective coupling regime , where superradiant emission into the field mode provides for the necessary gain  @xcite . in this domain of operation a huge collective dipole constituted by a large number of atoms , which are synchronized via their common coupling to the cavity field  @xcite , will build up .    the general idea of superradiant lasers and their properties have been discussed already two decades ago  @xcite , where a unique frequency stability scaling with the inverse square of the atom number @xmath1 and squeezed output light was predicted .",
    "their superb accuracy in the regime of a cavity linewidth much larger than the atomic linewidth were highlighted just recently  @xcite .",
    "most importantly , in this case the laser becomes very insensitive to technical noise in the resonator and its properties are dominated by the intrinsic stability of the collective atomic dipole . under favorable conditions , with only a few photons and millions of atoms present , a natural width of the system several orders of magnitude below the @xmath2 hz - level could be envisaged .",
    "a central , yet open technical problem here is the implementation of a uniform collective coupling of the atoms to the field mode as well as the optical pumping in the atomic system without a considerable perturbation of the lasing levels , which in this case include the atomic ground state .",
    "thus , a very careful choice of operating parameters is required . here",
    ", we study another intrinsic source of perturbation in this sensitive system , namely direct dipole - dipole interaction between the laser active atoms , as they are densely confined within the optical resonator . similar to atom - atom collisions in ramsey experiments  @xcite , dipole - dipole couplings tend to induce phase noise and decoherence of the collective atomic dipole . in particular in lattice setups at low filling , where collisions are strongly suppressed , this should constitute the most prominent source of noise for such a laser .",
    "the basic phenomenon of superradiance was theoretically studied in detail , e.g. by haroche and coworkers  @xcite , about 50 years ago using a variety of analytical approximation methods  @xcite . as an important effect",
    "one finds that the decay rate of low energy collective excitations grows linearly with the particle number @xmath1  @xcite . for multiply excited states the effect",
    "is increased further and the collective decay of a strongly inverted ensemble exhibits a delayed intensity maximum largely proportional to @xmath3 as a significant deviation from the exponential decay of individual atoms  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon has been observed in a large number of experiments in gases and solids  @xcite and more recently also for ultracold quantum gases  @xcite .    as in every laser setup",
    ", we naturally have to deal with inverted ensembles .",
    "hence , we can expect that superradiant effects will play an important role and the assumption of individual atomic decay at the independent free space single atom rate will loose its validity . let us emphasize that the collective symmetric coupling of the atoms to the cavity mode does not require the atoms to occupy a small volume of the order of a cubic wavelength , but simply calls for an almost equal cavity coupling constant for all atoms .",
    "dicke superradiant spontaneous decay , on the other hand , is maximal for closely spaced emitters , but still plays a decisive role in more extended geometries and in particular for regularly ordered ensembles . while this free space superradiant interaction and decay",
    "was incorporated intrinsically in the early works on superradiant lasing  @xcite , it was neglected in the more recent considerations on superradiant lasing on ultra narrow atomic transitions  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the full model for the collective decay process in a superradiant laser configuration .",
    "while the underlying hamiltonian and dynamical master equations for the coupled atom - field dynamics are well established , exact treatments of the full decay problem for more than a few particles is hardly possible apart from some special cases .",
    "numerical simulations can be performed for somewhat higher atom numbers in the fully collective limit .",
    "however , for more particles in a small but finite volume , collective and individual decay are present and the equations immediately become very cumbersome , as the number of occupied states within the total physical hilbert space ( growing as @xmath4 ) gets prohibitively large .",
    "interesting results can still be obtained for special finite configurations , which should exhibit the qualitative consequences of dipole - dipole coupling quite well .",
    "besides demonstrating the underlying basic physical mechanisms , our study aims at direct implications for the laser linewidth of a magic wavelength lattice laser in the superradiant regime  @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath1 identical two - level atoms held in a regular spaced configuration , e.g. in a far detuned optical trap , each of them symmetrically coupled to a single mode of a high @xmath0 optical resonator . due to the inherent exposure of the atoms to the vacuum bath",
    "the ensemble is affected by coherent dipole - dipole energy exchange processes and also by collective spontaneous emission  @xcite .",
    "further , we employ a transverse incoherent pump , which allows us to use the atoms as an active medium , as well as another dissipative process , the cavity loss . upon",
    "born , rotating wave and markov approximation we end up with a standard lindblad type master equation .",

    "first , let us exhibit some general features of the dynamics of a laser with all atoms coupled equally to the cavity mode in the two idealized limiting cases of ( a ) fully collective and ( b ) individual independent spontaneous decay .",

    "as reference oscillators less effort in order to achieve technical stabilization is expected in an ideal superradiant laser . in the following",
    "we will study the effect of a varying cavity frequency described by an effective detuning ( @xmath63 ) on the average photon number ( fig .",

    "the detuning sensitivity of the laser output spectrum in these two cases is depicted in fig .",

    "a sort of self - synchronization of the atomic dipoles via direct interactions can lead to very strong suppression of cavity fluctuations at the expense of very little output light , while for stronger pumping interaction effects are suppressed and the cavity drifts produce a more significant impact on the laser frequency .",
    "overall , we observe that by choosing optimal operating conditions a decoupling of the cavity fluctuations from the laser frequency can be suppressed very effectively , even in the case of atomic interactions .",

    "superradiant free space decay will substantially broaden the laser line and increase the sensitivity of the laser frequency to cavity drifts .",
    "quantitatively , the various limiting cases of a completely collective laser as opposed to an independent atom system can lead to a different scaling behavior of the photon number and the linewidth with substantially different photon statistics .",
    "fortunately , for a strontium setup based on a magic wavelength lattice , the detrimental effects remain very small , although they could attain an observable magnitude at high filling . at optimally chosen operating conditions dipole dipole interaction can be exploited to reduce laser frequency fluctuations via direct phase stabilization even at very low photon numbers .    in this work",
    "we still assumed a rather ideal and to some extent artificial pumping mechanism , replenishing the upper atomic state by introducing the minimum necessary decoherence only , while also neglecting light shifts from the pump lasers .",
    "any more realistic pumping via extra levels or an injection of excited atoms would , of course , add extra noise and has to be designed very carefully .",
    "this is one of the major remaining challenges for the implementation of such an optical version of the hydrogen maser . in any case , from the point of view of stability and shifts , the operation at weak pump strength seems favorable , although the very weak output field could be a technical challenge for practical use .",
