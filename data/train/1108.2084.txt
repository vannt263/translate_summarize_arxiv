    "cosmic rays have been studied extensively at various earth- , balloon- and satellite - based experiments .",
    "recently , the pamela satellite has observed an unexpected rise in the cosmic - ray positron fraction from approximately @xmath1 to @xmath2  gev  @xcite .",
    "this feature is not explained by the expected background from the secondary production of cosmic - rays positrons .",
    "moreover , observations of the total flux of electrons and positrons by fermi - lat  @xcite and h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite also show an excess over the predicted background , up to an energy of @xmath3  tev .",
    "the presence of nearby pulsars could provide an astrophysical explanation for these observations  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , more exotic scenarios remain possible .",
    "the annihilation of dark matter in the galactic halo to electrons and positrons provides one such possibility , though generic annihilation cross sections must be enhanced by a large boost factor in order to describe the data  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the excess could be explained by a tev - scale decaying dark matter candidate .",
    "( for example , see ref .",
    "@xcite ; for a recent review , see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) in this scenario , fits to the cosmic - ray data indicate that the dark matter must decay primarily to leptons with a lifetime of @xmath4  s.    while the thermal freeze - out of weakly - interacting , electroweak - scale dark matter can naturally lead to the desired relic density , this is not the only possible framework that can account for the present dark matter abundance .",
    "recently proposed asymmetric dark matter models relate the baryon or lepton number densities to the dark matter number density , motivated by the fact that these quantities are not wildly dissimilar  @xcite .",
    "tev - scale asymmetric dark matter models have been constructed , for example , in refs .",
    "the asymmetry between dark matter particles and antiparticles can lead to differences in the primary cosmic - ray spectra of electrons and positrons , with potentially measurable consequences  @xcite .",
    "evidence for such charge asymmetric dark matter decays would disfavor the pulsar explanation of the @xmath5 excess  @xcite .",
    "in addition , charge asymmetric dark matter decays may allow one to discern whether dark matter decays are lepton - flavor - violating  @xcite .",
    "for example , the cosmic - ray spectra that one expects if dark matter decays symmetrically to @xmath6 and @xmath7 are indistinguishable from those obtained by assuming flavor - conserving decays to @xmath8 and @xmath9 with equal branching fraction ; the same is not true if the dark matter decays asymmetrically to @xmath10 alone , 100% of the time .    refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite study the cosmic - ray @xmath5 spectra assuming a number of two - body charge - asymmetric dark matter decays , with the latter work focusing on lepton - flavor - violating modes . in this paper",
    ", we extend this body of work to charge - asymmetric three - body decays and , in particular , to modes that violate lepton flavor .",
    "we assume a spin-@xmath0 dark matter candidate that decays via four - fermion contact interactions to two charged leptons and a light , stable neutral particle . for the present purposes ,",
    "the latter could either be a standard model neutrino or a lighter dark matter component .",
    "four - fermion interactions have",
    "a long history in the development of the weak interactions , and one can easily imagine that dark matter decays could be the consequence of operators of this form , generated by higher - scale physics . moreover",
    ", the possible presence of a neutrino in the primary decay may lead to interesting signals at neutrino telescopes  @xcite . unlike the two - body decays already considered in the literature ,",
    "the precise energy distribution of the decay products is affected by the dirac matrix structure of these contact interactions , which is not known ( unless a model is specified ) . by considering the most general possibilities ,",
    "we show that different choices for the dirac structure of the decay operators defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : ops ] can be substantially compensated by different choices for the dark matter mass @xmath11 and lifetime @xmath12 ; while the best fit values of these parameters change , the predicted spectra are not dramatically altered . on the other hand , we find that the flavor structure of the decay operator has a more significant effect .",
    "assuming various lepton - flavor - conserving and flavor - violating decay modes , we compute the resulting cosmic - ray spectra , performing @xmath13 fits to the data to determine the optimal dark matter masses and lifetimes . like refs .",
    "@xcite , we obtain predictions for these spectra at @xmath5 energies that are higher than those than can be probed accurately now .",
    "future data from experiments like ams-02  @xcite may provide the opportunity to test these predictions , and evaluate them relative to other interpretations of the cosmic - ray positron excess .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the assumed form of the dark matter operators . in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectra ] , we present the results of our numerical analysis and in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] , we discuss our results and directions for future work .",
    "we consider a spin-@xmath0 dark matter candidate @xmath14 that decays to @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are generation indices and @xmath18 represents a light , neutral particle .",
    "we assume that @xmath18 is either a standard model neutrino or a secondary dark matter component that is much lighter than @xmath14 and contributes negligibly to the relic density . in the present analysis",
    ", the exact nature of the light neutral state will be irrelevant since its effect on our results will come solely from kinematics .",
    "we focus on the simplest scenario , in which there are no additional decay channels involving the charge conjugate of @xmath18 , and consider the possible four - fermion operators that contribute to the decays of interest .",
    "we work directly with the operators that may appear after the standard model electroweak gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken ; for any operator found to have phenomenologically desirable properties , one may easily construct a gauge - invariant origin after the fact .",
    "note that the production of a neutrino in the primary decay may have interesting phenomenological consequences ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which provides a separate motivation for our three - fermion final state .",
    "once this choice is made , the dark matter spin must be @xmath0 if the underlying theory is renormalizable  .",
    "the problem of parametrizing an unknown decay amplitude of one spin-@xmath0 particle to three distinct spin-@xmath0 decay products was encountered in the study of muon decay , before the standard model was well established . the most general decay amplitude @xmath19 can be parametrized by  @xcite @xmath20 \\ ,",

    "terms involving the contraction of spinor indices that link different pairs of spinor wave functions can be recast in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : genamp ] ) via fierz transformations .",
    "since the final state particles are much lighter than the dark matter candidate ( which is at the tev scale ) , we can safely neglect their masses .",
    "since the neutral final state particle is stable , the energy spectra of electrons and positrons that are observed at cosmic - ray observatories are determined by the energy spectra of the the charged leptons , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , that are produced in the primary decay ; this follows from the differential decay distribution @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the spin - summed / averaged squared amplitude .",
    "we evaluate this quantity exactly from eq .",

    "in the present analysis , however , the exact relations are not particularly important ; by leaving @xmath11 and @xmath12 as fitting parameters , one obtains very similar predicted spectra , independent of the choice of the @xmath40 .",
    "the fact that _ some _ solution exists for any desired dirac structure of the underlying four - fermion operator makes it potentially easier to construct explicit models .",
    "though we reserve the task of model - building to future work , it is worth noting , for example , that the operator @xmath41 corresponding to @xmath42 and @xmath43 , is a particularly interesting choice , since it is already gauge invariant under the standard model gauge group and may provide a simple starting point for constructing a plausible ultraviolet completion .",
    "we computed the electron and positron spectra using pythia  @xcite , taking into account the energy distributions of the primary leptons @xmath28 and @xmath29 . as a cross check ,",
    "we have written code that incorporates eq .",
    "( [ eq : ddifdist ] ) , computed directly from a choice of the underlying four - fermion operator , as well as code that incorporates only the distributions eq .",

    "we have also compared output from different versions of our code , based on pythia 6.4 and pythia 8.1 , respectively .",
    "results from these different approaches were found to be agreement .",
    "to compute the relevant cosmic - ray fluxes , one must take into account that electrons and positrons produced in dark matter decays must propagate through the galaxy before reaching earth .",

    "we consider dark matter decays of the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a charged lepton of the @xmath77 generation .",
    "there are nine such decay channels , and we require @xmath78 where the @xmath79 are branching fractions . for decays involving more than one channel , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the electron / positron energy spectrum for @xmath75 . in sec .",

    ".    to summarize , when we use the cosmic - ray propagation model described in the previous subsection , the resulting positron fraction and total electron - positron flux measured at the top of the earth s atmosphere are determined by @xmath87 parameters : @xmath11 , @xmath72 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and eight of the nine branching fractions .    for each of the decay scenarios considered below , we fixed @xmath82 and the branching fractions and then performed a @xmath13 fit to the pamela , fermi lat , h.e.s.s .",
    "2008 and h.e.s.s .",
    "2009 data with @xmath11 and @xmath72 as fitting parameters .",
    "we allowed @xmath11 to vary in increments of @xmath88 gev , and we allowed @xmath72 to vary in increments of @xmath89 s. we consider the range @xmath90  gev , where the effects of a tev - scale dark matter candidate are relevant .",
    "where the high - energy and low - energy fermi data overlap , we have plotted only the high - energy data .",

    "bands of systematic uncertainty . )    leaving @xmath11 and @xmath72 as free variables , we find that our results are relatively insensitive to the choice of @xmath82 .",
    "this is demonstrated for the pure decay @xmath91 in fig .",
    "[ tautau ] where we show the envelope of possible cosmic - ray spectra ; that is , when we sample the @xmath82 parameter space , we find that all of the resulting curves fall between those plotted in fig .",

    "we performed the same analysis on the other decay scenarios discussed below and found a similar behavior .",
    "as such , we take @xmath99 for the remaining results that we present .    as a starting point",
    ", we show the cosmic - ray spectra for some charged - lepton - flavor - conserving decays in fig .",
    "[ fc ] .",
    "we consider the pure decays @xmath100 and @xmath91 , and we also consider the flavor - democratic decay for which @xmath101 for all @xmath16 . for @xmath100 , we have a @xmath96 of approximately @xmath102 . for @xmath91",
    ", we have @xmath103 . and for the flavor - democratic @xmath104 , we have @xmath105 .",
    "these are to be contrasted with the flavor - violating decays of fig .",
    "[ fv ] .",
    "we consider three classes of flavor - violating decays : @xmath106 each class contains two decay channels ( e.g. , @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) .",
    "we consider all six of the pure decays , i.e. , decays involving only one channel .",
    "we also consider mixtures of decay channels belonging to the same class ; some representative choices are shown in fig .",
    "[ fv ] .",
    "note that , for fixed @xmath11 and @xmath72 , the total electron - positron flux  which does not distinguish between the two electric charges  is the same for any two decays belonging to the same class .",
    "for this reason , we require only one plot of the total flux in fig .",
    "we find that the @xmath13 is relatively flat as a function of the branching fraction within each class of decays : over the range of possible branching fractions , we find that the @xmath96 varies by no more than @xmath109 from @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath98 , for @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "different choices for the branching fraction within a given class describe the existing data well , but provide different predicted spectra that interpolate between the curves shown .",
    "note that the distinctive dip in the @xmath115 and @xmath116 positron fractions around @xmath117  tev is due to the hard electron produced in the initial decay ; this greatly enhances the electron to positron ratio in the high energy bins , leading to a suppression in the positron fraction for fixed total flux .",
    "the results presented in the previous section show that a variety of possible lepton - flavor - violating decay modes for a spin-@xmath0 , charge asymmetric dark matter candidate can describe existing data well , as quantified by the @xmath13 per degree of freedom for the best fits to the data .",
    "significantly , the results for the predicted positron fraction differ substantially for energies above @xmath118  gev , the maximum for which the pamela experiment is sensitive . in some case ,",
    "more precise measurement of the total electron - postron flux around @xmath117  tev may also provide a means of distinguishing these scenarios .",
    "future data from experiments like ams-02  @xcite , which can probe these energy ranges of the predicted spectra , may determine whether the possibilities discussed in this letter present viable descriptions of the cosmic - ray spectrum .",
    "in the meantime , the present work suggests a number of directions for further study : in the case where the stable , neutral particle in the final state is a standard model neutrino , one could study whether the decays of asymmetric dark matter that we have considered could be probed at neutrino observatories like icecube  @xcite .",
    "one could also study additional astrophysical bounds on the scenarios described , for example , from the extragalactic gamma ray flux  @xcite .",
    "one can also attempt to find preferred forms of the underlying four - fermion operators ( whose effects were parametrized in the present analysis by @xmath40 ) by studying the simplest and best - motivated models that provide for their origin .",
