    "a.  losev brought to our attention the fact that some computations made by n.  berkovits in the framework of string theory contain an intricate description of minimal resolution for the projective coordinate algebra of connected component of complex isotropic grassmannian @xmath10 associated with non degenerate quadratic form on @xmath11 .",
    "subsequent papers by m.  movshev , a.  schwarz and others clarify the berkovits computations as well as the interplay between the syzygies and a graded lie superalgebra koszul dual to the coordinate algebra of @xmath10 .",
    "but the main focus of these papers remains with s - symmetric field theories , and the presentation of underlying mathematics seems to us rather tangled and over - diligent .    the main goal of these notes is to give relatively simple and clear presentation of the mathematics behind the sophisticated computations cited above and to illustrate it by some classical geometric examples .",
    "we tried to make the text self contained and understandable for advanced students .",
    "we believe that the subject is fruitful , and hope that this exposition could promote mutual understanding between mathematical and physical communities .",
    "the paper consists of five sections .",
    "the first three of them are essentially independent . in ",
    "1 we collect necessary algebraic geometric properties of projective varieties @xmath12 that appear as the projectivization of the orbit of the highest weight vector in an irreducible representation @xmath13 of a simply connected semisimple complex lie group @xmath3 . class of these varieties clearly contains the isotropic grassmannians and serves a convenient generalization for the smooth , which is especially interesting for physicists because it serves some model of gravity . but",
    "the mathematical statements here are rather unclear to us and most likely require appropriate @xmath14 enchantment of the smooth case . in these notes we restrict ourselves to the smooth homogeneous spaces only . ] varieties of ` pure spinors ' considered in s - symmetric theories cited above . in [ qrel ] we write down explicitly the quadratic equations generating the homogeneous ideal @xmath15 in [ hvprop ] we show that if @xmath8 is subcanonical , i.e. @xmath16 for some @xmath17 , then non zero cohomologies @xmath18 can appear only for @xmath19 or for @xmath20 .    in  2 we consider an arbitrary smooth subcanonical projective variety satisfying the previous vanishing conditions on @xmath18 . by  1 , all subcanonical projective highest weight orbits belong to this class . using movshev s strategy from @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "we show that for such @xmath8 the space @xmath0 of the syzygies for the graded projective coordinate algebra @xmath21 inherits a natural structure of the frobenius algebra .",
    "in other words , we construct an s - commutative multiplication on @xmath1 and a trace form @xmath22 such that the bilinear pairing @xmath23 is non degenerated .",
    "this generalizes and clarifies the duality isomorphisms constructed in @xcite , @xcite for the smooth varieties of pure spinors .",
    "in  3 we deal with an arbitrary commutative koszul quadratic algebra @xmath1 .",
    "all the coordinate algebras of projective highest weight orbits are of this sort due to bezrukavnikov s result @xcite .",
    "it is well known that such an algebra is canonically identified with the cohomology algebra @xmath24 of the graded lie superalgebra @xmath25 whose universal enveloping algebra @xmath26 is priddy dual to @xmath1 .",
    "we show that there is an isomorphism of algebras @xmath27 where the space of syzygies @xmath0 is considered with the algebra structure constructed in  2 , and @xmath28 is graded lie subalgebra started with @xmath29-component of @xmath30 ( the algebra structure on @xmath31 is standard ) .",
    "the proof is based on a kind of differential perturbation lemma ( see [ dpl ] ) .    in  4",
    "we illustrate the previous technique by several non trivial examples .",
    "namely , we compute the syzygies of the most singular commutative quadratic algebra @xmath32 ( see [ syz_free_lie ] ) , the syzygies of rational normal curves ( see [ cor : vcsyz ] ) , and the syzygies of grassmannians @xmath9 under the plcker embeddings ( see [ syzygies ] ) .",
    "these results are also known for experts and can be extracted from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "our approach allows to treat all three examples uniformly : we use the description of the lie algebra cohomology @xmath31 . in the first two examples",
    "( actually served by free lie algebras ) the computation is very simple and takes just a few rows . in the grassmannian case",
    "the algebra of syzygies is what we call _ a hook algebra_. in the last  5 we collect generic properties of the hook algebras , in particular , we prove that each hook algebra is quadratic and koszul .",
