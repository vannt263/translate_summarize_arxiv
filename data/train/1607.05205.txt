    "the cold atom community has revived the study of the approach to thermal equilibrium for large isolated quantum systems .",
    "we refer to @xcite and references therein on previous work .",
    "most accessible , both numerically and experimentally , are lattice systems in one dimension .",
    "one dimension is peculiar , since there are models with an extensive number of locally conserved fields .",
    "examples of such quantum integrable systems are the xxz spin chain and the continuum lieb - liniger @xmath1-bose gas .",
    "obviously the pathway to equilibrium will depend crucially on whether the system is integrable or not @xcite .",
    "but in addition there is also the dependence on initial conditions which is potentially overwhelming .",
    "one could prepare the system already in thermal equilibrium and study the response to small initial perturbations @xcite .",
    "these are the much investigated time response and correlation functions in equilibrium",
    ". the initial state could be translation invariant , to some extent thereby suppressing the mostly slow spatial variations @xcite .",
    "recently initial domain - wall states have become very popular @xcite .",
    "such a state is obtained by joining two distinct thermal states at a single point ( and at two points in case of periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "domain - wall states will be the main focus of our contribution .",
    "browsing the introductions to the papers mentioned above , one might have the impression that the approach to equilibrium for classical systems in one dimension is a well - covered topic .",
    "we study here fermi - pasta - ulam type anharmonic chains with domain - wall initial conditions and are not aware of any previous systematic study .",
    "the structure of equilibrium time - correlations for such chains has been elucidated only recently @xcite . in particular one now understands the link to anomalous transport which is most directly observed when coupling the chain to thermal reservoirs at distinct temperatures , see @xcite . as in the quantum world , there are integrable chains , in our context the most famous one being the toda chain . but the kam theorem signals in addition the possibility that , as a function of the energy , the structure may change from integrable to chaotic .",
    "this energy threshold is fascinating from the perspective of nonlinear dynamics and has attracted considerable attention @xcite .",
    "we hope that a better understanding of classical models also serves as an incentive to look for related phenomena in quantum systems .",
    "the parameters of the initial domain - wall state will be chosen such that in the accessible part of phase space the chain dynamics is sufficiently chaotic .",
    "then one would expect that the conserved fields as computed from the chain dynamics are approximated by the respective solution of the macroscopic euler equations , for times limited by diffusive effects .",
    "how well such expectations work out will have to be studied .",
    "the euler equations are based on the notion of local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the microscopic local conservation laws are deduced from the chain dynamics and are then averaged in the stipulated local equilibrium state so to arrive at a closed set of equations for the conserved fields .",
    "in particular , to reach non - trivial predictions , the thermal average of the microscopic currents is not allowed to vanish .",
    "this is ensured if the interaction potential depends only on positional differences , as @xmath2 , implying momentum conservation . upon adding an on - site potential , @xmath3 , momentum conservation would be broken ,",
    "all euler currents would vanish , and the evolution of the initial step profile is determined by diffusive effects only .",
    "the euler equations are a system of @xmath4 hyperbolic conservation laws , @xmath5 for our case of anharmonic chains .",
    "they are of the generic form @xmath6 @xmath7 , @xmath8 , with given current functions @xmath9 . in the mathematical literature",
    "the domain - wall initial data are known as riemann problem for eq .  , which means @xmath10 for a wide class of current functions , there is a unique entropy solution to with initial conditions , see the exposition  @xcite , sections 48 .",
    "this solution scales ballistically as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is bounded and continuous except for isolated jumps , possibly .",
    "there is a well developed theory of how to compute @xmath12 , at least in principle @xcite , sections 13 . in our case",
    "the current functions are determined through the microscopic particle model , and hence of a very particular form .",
    "thus our task is twofold .",
    "firstly we have to investigate the solution to the riemann problem .",
    "secondly such predictions should be compared with numerical simulations of the dynamics .",
    "let us return for a moment to the distinction between integrable and non - integrable systems , both starting from a domain - wall initial state . as supported by a variety of studies on quantum integrable models @xcite",
    ", one expects that still holds in the integrable case .",
    "thus at first sight there seems to be little difference .",
    "of course , the macroscopic profiles are computed by using completely different methods for the two cases .",
    "but the real distinguishing feature is the appearance of shocks .",
    "an ideal gas with step - initial conditions shows ballistic spreading but no shocks .",
    "the entropy solution for the euler equations is a mathematical shorthand for the limit of small dissipation , which is meaningful only if the underlying dynamics is sufficiently chaotic . merely invoking the conservation laws , the euler equations admit stable and unstable shocks .",
    "such unphysical solutions to are removed by requiring a positive entropy production at the shock , as will be illustrated in the examples below . in a local region away from the shock , the local state is ( to very good approximation ) in thermal equilibrium .",
    "our study adds current fluctuations as an item , which can no longer be based on the euler equations .",
    "most simple - mindedly , one would consider the fluctuations of the time - integrated current across the origin . for anharmonic chains",
    "the current is a three - vector . in most cases one would find gaussian fluctuations of size @xmath13 , thus not so interesting from a theoretical perspective .",
    "a more global picture emerges by considering the current integrated along the ray @xmath14 for some prescribed velocity @xmath15 .",
    "the ray is chosen to lie in the interior of a rarefaction wave .",
    "in addition , one has to consider a computable but particular linear combination of the three currents .",
    "as will be discussed , then the integrated current fluctuations are of size @xmath0 , smaller as for all other linear combinations , and the statistics is given by the tracy - widom distribution known from random matrix theory .",
    "our paper consists of three , at first sight somewhat unrelated parts .",
    "we start with a stochastic model with two conserved fields , as always with domain - wall initial conditions . for our particular system",
    "the validity of the euler equations has been established mathematically @xcite .",
    "thus the model is used to explain the method by which one obtains the solution of the riemann problem and as a numerical benchmark .",
    "we proceed to anharmonic chains , first with a general interaction potential .",
    "analytically and numerically we then consider two specific choices for the potential , which generate sufficiently chaotic dynamics ( as known from previous studies ) . in the third part",
    "we discuss the fluctuations of time - integrated currents .",
    "a prototypical stochastic lattice gas is the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) .",
    "particles are located on @xmath16 , at most one particle per site . independently , after an exponentially distributed waiting time , a particle hops one step to the right , provided the target site is empty . clearly , the particle number is the only conserved field .    to move towards several conservation laws , we look for a minimal extension of the tasep to a model with two conserved fields . in the literature",
    "a standard generalization is known as leroux stochastic lattice gas .",
    "( this name goes back to fritz and tth @xcite , who prove the hydrodynamic limit globally in time .",
    "apparently , leroux first wrote down this particular system of conservation laws @xcite . )",
    "the leroux lattice gas has two types of particles with label @xmath17 .",
    "subject to the exclusion rule , the 1 particles jump to the right and the @xmath18 particles to the left , both according to the tasep rule .",
    "furthermore , a neighboring pair @xmath19 is exchanged to @xmath20 with rate @xmath21 , which leads to the simplification that the stationary measures are bernoulli .",
    "a generalization of leroux is the arndt - heinzel - rittenberg ( ahr ) model @xcite .",
    "more formally , we introduce occupation variables @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the only allowed exchanges are    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     note that in our convention the labels of the components are interchanged in comparison to @xcite . clearly , the only conserved fields are the two particle numbers .",
    "the invariant bernoulli measures are parametrized by the average densities @xmath24 and @xmath25 . the hydrodynamic equations simplify when written in terms of the average number of holes and the average velocity , i.e. , @xmath26 with @xmath27 we refer to @xmath28 as states , more appropriately , but also more lengthy , as steady state parameters , resp . as thermodynamic states in case of anharmonic chains .",
    "the single - site probabilities of the steady states are @xmath29 averages will be denoted by @xmath30 , the subscripts being omitted when obvious from the context . since the steady states are of product form , their average current is easily computed .",
    "thus , on a large space - time scale the conserved fields are governed by the entropy solution of @xmath31 with the current vector @xmath32    to discuss the solution to the riemann problem , we follow fairly closely the conventions of ref .  @xcite .",
    "one rewrites in semilinear form as @xmath33 where @xmath34 the eigenvalues of @xmath35 are @xmath36 and the corresponding right and left eigenvectors , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , are given by @xmath39 here @xmath40 and @xmath41 are positive normalization constants . for the riemann problem their explicit form is not needed . setting @xmath42 ,",

    "the normalization has been absorbed into the @xmath51-parameter .",
    "the integral curves are then determined by    @xmath52    it follows that @xmath53 which is negative for @xmath54 and positive for @xmath55 .",
