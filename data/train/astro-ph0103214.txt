    "cygnus x1 ( cyg  x1 ) is one of the brightest and best studied x - ray sources in the sky .",
    "it was the first source to be identified with a binary system in which the x - ray emission arises through accretion onto a compact object .",
    "( see e.g. tanaka & lewin ( 1995 ) for a review of black hole binaries ) .",
    "it is at a distance of @xmath0  kpc ( massey et al .",
    "1995 ) and consists of a supergiant star and a compact object , with an orbital period of 5.6 days .",
    "the mass of the unseen companion is significantly greater than @xmath1 ( dolan 1992 ) suggesting that it is a black hole .",
    "the high energy emission results from focused wind accretion from the supergiant ( gies & bolton 1986 ) that is almost filling its roche lobe .",
    "the x - ray flux varies on all timescales from milliseconds to months although most of its time is spent in the so - called low or hard state ( the ` low / hard ' state ) characterized by a low soft x - ray flux and strong hard x - ray flux .",
    "occasionally cyg  x1 makes a transition from the low / hard state to the high / soft state which is characterized by a larger soft x - ray flux ( by a factor of @xmath2 ) and weaker hard x - ray flux .",
    "the spectrum in the low / hard state above a few kev is typically a power law of photon index @xmath3  1.61.8 and a compton reflection component above about 10 kev ( done et al .",
    "1992 ; ebisawa et al 1996 ) with a high - energy cut - off above @xmath4 kev .",
    "there is evidence of complicated iron absorption and emission features around 67 kev ( barr , white & page 1985 ; marshall et al .",
    "1993 ; ebisawa et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in the high / soft state",
    "the spectrum is dominated by a soft blackbody - like component peaking around 1 kev with a power law tail of photon index @xmath5 ( gierliski et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the different spectral states are due to a qualitative change in the accretion flow ( see e.g. gierliski et al .",
    "1997 ; esin et al .",
    "1998 ; poutanen & coppi 1998 ; done & ycki 1999 ) . in the high / soft state",
    "there is a ` standard ' accretion disc extending in to the innermost stable circular orbit around the black hole , and in the low / hard state the region within a few 10s of schwarzschild radii becomes a geometrically thick , optically thin , radiatively inefficient advective flow ( see also nowak et al .",
    "the evidence for this is that in the low / hard state the reflected fraction appears to be low , which is consistent with the innermost parts of the accretion disc being missing , or at least thomson thin .",
    "the change between spectral states occurs with a small change in bolometric luminosity ( @xmath6 per cent ) and no change in @xmath7 kev luminosity to within @xmath8 per cent ( zhang et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "in this paper we investigate an alternative model in which the low inferred reflected fraction is a result of the ionization state of the accretion disc .",
    "a highly ionized disc may be an almost perfect reflector with weak reflection features ( as compared to cold reflection ) and hence may lead to an underestimate of the reflected fraction ( ross , fabian & young 1999 ; ross , fabian & brandt 1996 ; ross & fabian 1993 ; nayakshin , kazanas & kallman 2000 ) .",
    "the attraction of this model is that it does not require the nature of the accretion flow to change qualitatively between the spectral states ; a change which is observed to occur with little variation in bolometric luminosity as observed .",
    "it is just a change in density at the surface of the disc .",
    "previous conclusions that the disc can not be significantly ionized have been based on the absence of a strong photoelectric absorption edge at 8 kev . in the case of an ionized disc absorption and emission may occur at significant thomson depths ( @xmath9 ) and sharp features are blurred due to compton scattering .",
    "see e.g. fig .  7 of ross , fabian & young ( 1999 ) .",
    "in view of the extremely rapid continuum variability of cyg  x1 we may also expect its spectrum to change rapidly .",
    "the spectra that we fit are necessarily time averaged since a typical observation will last for millions of dynamical timescales .",
    "we use _ asca _ sis , _ asca _ gis , _ exosat _ and _ ginga _ data of cyg  x1 in the low / hard state and _ asca _ sis data of cyg  x1 in the high / soft state .",
    "we do not use the _ asca _ 93  oct data of the low / hard state since this was taken when the satellite was in daytime ( ebisawa et al .",
    "the data used are summarized in table  [ tab_data ] .",
    ".data sets used .",
    "the data set numbers 1 and 310 correspond to those of ebisawa et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and those prefixed by ` e ' correspond to those of done et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath10 ionization parameter + @xmath11 fraction of accretion power dissipated in the corona + @xmath12 inferred reflected fraction + @xmath13 observed photon index +    we also note that the predictions of changing spectral slope are consistent with the calculations of coppi ( 1999 ) in which an increase in the soft flux coupled with a reduction of the hard flux leads to an increase in the photon index of the continuum , i.e. a softer spectrum .",
    "our simple model is also consistent with the observational results of zdziarski , lubiski & smith ( 1999 ) whereby the inferred ( cold ) reflected fraction is correlated with the observed photon index .",
    "the correlation is almost linear ranging from a reflected fraction of 0 with a photon index of @xmath14 up to a reflected fraction of 2 with a photon index of @xmath15 , with some scatter .",
    "this correlation is also seen within individual objects whose photon indices and reflected fractions change with time .",
    "we predict that a softer spectrum ( high photon index ) should have a lower value of the ionization parameter and hence most of the disc may produce a cold line resulting in a large inferred reflected fraction . in the case of a harder spectrum ( low photon index ) we predict a higher value of the ionization parameter and the spectrum will be that of an ionized disc as discussed above .",
    "this may result in the inferred reflected fraction being lower .",
    "another model that is able to reproduce this correlation is that of beloborodov ( 1999 ) in which the x - ray sources move away from the disc at mildly relativistic speeds .",
    "further detailed calculations are , of course , required to investigate this model properly .",
    "it is not clear how cyg  x1 , and other bhc , remain ` locked ' into their spectral states when the dynamical timescale is so short .",
    "future observations with higher spectral resolution will provide much more stringent tests of the accretion disc models for cyg  x1 and other bhc . at present , even with the _ asca _ data , we are unable to place strong constraints on the parameter space of our model ( e.g. inner disc radius , reflected fraction ) as our statistics are not good enough .",
    "this model is also applicable to other black hole candidates and we hope to investigate these in the future .",
    "more complete models that account for the detailed ionization structure of the accretion disc as a function of radius need to be computed .",
    "we thank ken ebisawa for the _ asca _ and _ ginga _ data of cyg  x1 in the low / hard state , and keith arnaud for advice on solving our convolution problem .",
    "we would also like to thank the referee p. t. ycki for helpful comments .",

    "the disc spectra are convolved with the kernel of the diskline model ( fabian et al .",
    "1989 ) . in order to do this our disc spectrum must be evaluated outside the range over which we are fitting the data .",
    "this is because , for example , higher energy photons may be redshifted into the band we are fitting .",
    "if the response matrix of the detector is such that the set of channels that correspond to a higher energy photon is distinct from the set of channels channels that correspond to a photon in the energy range being fitted then the model will not be evaluated at that higher energy and hence that contribution will be lost .",
    "this leads to the model spectrum dropping off at the edges of the range being fitted .",
    "a solution to this is to firstly combine the response and auxiliary response matrices , and to replace the auxiliary response matrix with one in which the effective area of each energy bin is unity .",
    "the extend command may then be used to enlarge the energy range over which the model is evaluated .",
    "this solves the problem ."
