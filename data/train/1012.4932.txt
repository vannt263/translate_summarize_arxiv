    "bi@xmath0te@xmath1 has a rhombohedral structure with a space group @xmath4 , which is denoted as phase i ; the hexagonal unit - cell parameters are @xmath5 = 4.395    and @xmath6 = 30.44    at ambient pressure and temperature @xcite .",
    "bulk bi@xmath0te@xmath1 has a relatively narrow band - gap of 0.171 ev @xcite and a high density of states near the fermi level . upon applying pressure ,",
    "these characters are expected to cause metallization and superconductivity @xcite .",
    "several groups have reported pressure - induced superconductivity @xcite . in our previous study under hydrostatic pressure ,",
    "the onset temperature of the superconducting transition @xmath7 is 2.7 k at 9.0 gpa . as the pressure increases",
    ", @xmath7 decreases up to 10 gpa , but greatly increases from 10 to 13 gpa : @xmath7 = 5.0 k at 13 gpa @xcite .",
    "high - pressure x - ray diffraction studies have shown that the structural phase transition from phase i to phase ii occurs around 8 gpa @xcite . the phase ii coexists phase iii under pressure above 14 gpa @xcite .",
    "the crystal structures of phase ii and iii have yet to be determined .",
    "_ al . _ have performed x - ray diffraction measurements using an ethanol@xmath3methanol mixture as transmitting medium , and found the phase ii crystal has orthorhombic @xmath8 symmetry @xcite .",
    "compared to the structural changes under high pressure , the negative and positive pressure dependences of @xmath9 are assumed to be due to phase ii and phase iii , respectively @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a recent theoretical study predicted bi@xmath0te@xmath1 , bismuth selenide bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , and bismuth@xmath3antimony binary alloy bi@xmath10sb@xmath11 are candidates for three - dimensional topological insulators @xcite , and they have been experimentally established @xcite .",
    "since then , bi@xmath0te@xmath1 has attracted much attention in basic and applied research .",
    "herein we conduct x - ray diffraction measurements under hydrostatic pressure up to 30 gpa to reveal the structure at higher pressures because structural information is crucial for understanding various phenomena .",
    "the sample was a lumps of polycrystalline bi@xmath0te@xmath1 ( 99.99% purity , kojundo chemical lab .",
    "co. , ltd . ) , which was cooled by liquid nitrogen in an alumina mortar and subsequently ground into a fine powder over 10 hours under nitrogen gas .",
    "the sample was pressurized using a diamond anvil cell ( dac ) assembled by a pair of diamond anvils with 0.3 mm culet - diameter and 2 mm anvil - height .",
    "the indentation technique using the anvil culet surface reduced the rhenium gasket thickness from 150 @xmath12 to 45 @xmath12 .",
    "the sample chamber was prepared by drilling a 160 @xmath12 diameter hole at the center of the indentation on the gasket .",
    "the powdered sample was placed in the chamber with ruby balls ( @xmath1310 @xmath12 in diameter ) as a pressure marker @xcite .",
    "then the chamber was filled with high - density helium gas as the pressure - transmitting medium , which was compressed up to 180 mpa at room temperature by a gas loading system @xcite .",
    "angle - dispersive powder x - ray diffraction measurements were carried out in beamline bl-18c of the photon factory in high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) , tsukuba , japan .",
    "the sample in the dac was irradiated using synchrotron radiation beams monochromatized to an energy of 25.6 kev ( @xmath14 @xmath15 0.4840  ) through a pinhole collimator with a 40 @xmath12 in diameter .",
    "each diffraction pattern was recorded using an imaging plate ( 200 mm@xmath16250 mm area ) with an exposure time between 120@xmath3540 min upon compression up to 29.8 gpa and upon decompression at room temperature .",
    "figure 1 shows the x - ray diffraction patterns of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 .",
    "all the reflections obtained at 0.61 gpa are explained by space group @xmath4 with lattice parameters of @xmath17 = 4.366(0 )    and @xmath18 = 30.11(0 )   .",
    "the reflections from phase ii @xcite are observed at pressure above 8.41 gpa .",
    "these intensities are enhanced under pressure up to about 20 gpa .",
    "after the transition from phase i to phase ii , we found small reflections , which are marked by @xmath19 and @xmath20 at pressure above 14.5 gpa in fig . 1 and differ from the phase ii reflections .",
    "this mixed - phase state continues to 23.1 gpa .",
    "however , the crystal structure transforms to the high - symmetry one at the pressures above 25.2 gpa ; a single phase assigned to a cubic system is obtained . from the changes in the patterns , reflections @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "are assigned to phase iii and phase iv , respectively .",
    "as the pressure decreases from 29.8 gpa , the diffraction patterns exhibit the opposite change with a pressure hysteresis . at 10.3 gpa ,",
    "phase ii and iii reappear , and the original rhombohedral phase i reappears at 2.43 gpa . as shown in the top of fig .",
    "1 , phase i is completely recovered upon releasing the pressure .",
    "a body - centered cubic ( bcc ) structure can explain the peaks from phase iv obtained at 25.2 gpa .",
    "except for the bcc - phase peaks , extra reflections are not present [ fig .",
    "2(a ) ] , suggesting the structural model of phase iv is analogous to substitutional binary alloys ; the bi and te atoms with their original concentrations are arranged in the bcc - sites . for structural refinement",
    ", we assumed the structure of phase iv has a probability of bi 40% and te 60% atoms and the atoms are arranged in the bcc - lattice sites with space group @xmath2 .",
    "rietveld refinement of phase iv was performed for the diffraction patterns obtained at 23.1 , 25.2 , 27.4 , and 29.8 gpa using rietan-2000 program @xcite . in the present analysis ,",
    "the calculated patterns agree well the experimental ones within @xmath21 = 2.54@xmath32.75% , @xmath22 = 0.770@xmath31.12 at each pressure .",
    "figure 2(b ) shows the result of rietveld analysis for the diffraction pattern obtained at 25.2 gpa with @xmath23 factor @xmath21 = 2.73% and @xmath22 = 0.830 , yielding a lattice constant of @xmath17 = 3.583(0 )  .",
    "therefore , we determined that the structure of phase iv in bi@xmath0te@xmath1 can be explained by a solid solution with a bcc - lattice in the bi@xmath3te binary system .",
    "figure 3 shows the pressure change with atomic volume in phase iv .",
    "the atomic volume continuously decreases with increasing pressure . at 29.8 gpa ,",
    "the atomic volume reaches 66.4% of the original volume at ambient pressure .",
    "we evaluated the homogeneity of the bcc - solid solution in the bi@xmath3te system through vegard s law @xcite , which is an empirical rule to explain the character of a solid solution .",
    "the law holds that a linear relation , which can be explained by a hard sphere model @xcite , exists between the lattice constant of an alloy and the concentrations of the constituent elements at a constant temperature @xcite . as with bi@xmath0te@xmath1",
    ", the crystal structures of pure bismuth and tellurium also exhibit high - pressure bcc - phases @xcite .",
    "therefore , we compared the bcc - phase atomic - volume of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 to that of bi@xmath24te@xmath25 obtained from a linear interpolation between pure bismuth and tellurium .",
    "each atomic volume of bismuth and tellurium was estimated by the equation of state curve reported in previous studies @xcite . at each pressure , we initially estimated the atomic volumes of the bcc - phase in pure bismuth and tellurium by interpolation and extrapolation using first - order murnaghan and vinet equations of state , respectively",
    ". then , we estimated the atomic volumes of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 as a solid solution of 60 atomic% tellurium concentration , bi@xmath24te@xmath25 .",
    "finally , we compared the atomic volumes of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 to those of pure bismuth , tellurium , and bi@xmath24te@xmath25 under high pressure .",
    "figure 4 shows the pressure dependence of the atomic volumes of the high - pressure bcc - phases in experimentally observed bi@xmath0te@xmath1 , estimated bi@xmath26te@xmath27 , pure bismuth , and pure tellurium .",
    "the atomic volumes of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 greatly deviate from the values estimated by vegard s law @xmath28 when the deviation is defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath28 are the experimentally obtained atomic volumes and the estimated one from vegard s law , respectively . from the definition ,",
    "the estimated deviation is 3.702@xmath34.873% , and @xmath30 is larger than @xmath28 at each pressure . at ambient pressure ,",
    "the lattice constants and tellurium concentration has been compared in a metastable solid solution containing up to 50 atomic% tellurium by an ultra - high cooling rate of the melt @xcite . in the concentrate region ,",
    "the experimentally - obtained atomic volume is larger than one estimated from the hard - sphere model .",
    "meanwhile , the bismuth@xmath3antimony alloy bi@xmath10sb@xmath11 , which is a typical binary complete solid solution , shows a linear behavior with vegard s law at ambient conditions .",
    "additionally , bi@xmath10sb@xmath11 forms the bcc structure under high pressure ; the phase transition to the bcc structure occurs at 12 gpa for @xmath31 = 0.15 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have clearly shown the atomic volume of bi@xmath32sb@xmath33 follows vegard s law under high pressure @xcite .    at ambient pressure , bi@xmath10sb@xmath11 , which is composed of elements in the 15th group of the periodic table , forms covalent bonds @xcite . on the other hand , in bi@xmath0te@xmath1 ,",
    "which is composed of elements in the 15th and 16th groups , the covalent bonds have an ionic component along bi@xmath3te bonds , which causes the bonds to be stronger than normal covalent bonds @xcite .",
    "therefore , we infer that the deviation from vegard s law in phase iv of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 is due to the remaining strong ionic - covalent bonds in the pressure region of phase iv . upon",
    "further compression , the ionic - covalent bonds should disappear , and the atomic volume of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 will obey vegard s law .",
    "synchrotron - radiation x - ray diffraction measurements were used to investigate the high - pressure structural phase of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 up to 29.8 gpa . we found a high - pressure bcc - phase in bi@xmath0te@xmath1 at 25.2 gpa .",
    "the structure of phase iv is explained by a solid solution with a bcc - lattice in space group @xmath2 for a bi@xmath3te binary system ; the bi and te atoms are distributed in the bcc - lattice sites . due to the remaining strong ionic - covalent bonds up to 29.8 gpa",
