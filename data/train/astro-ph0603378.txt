    "fu orionis objects ( fuors ) undergo some of the most extreme variability seen in low mass pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars .",
    "the classical fuors are characterized by optical outbursts during which the star increases in brightness by several magnitudes over @xmath11 - 10 years and then slowly decays on timescales of @xmath120 - 100 years .",
    "the underlying cause of these flare - ups is not known .",
    "herbig ( 1977 ) considered several possible mechanisms but none emerged as a clear favorite .",
    "more recent work has focused on the idea that the brightenings are due to a dramatic increase in the accretion rate through a circumstellar disk , perhaps triggered by disk instabilities or interactions with a close binary companion .",
    "a review of the fu orionis phenomenon and the evidence favoring episodic accretion as its cause was given by hartmann & kenyon ( 1996 = hk96 ) .",
    "potential difficulties with the accretion interpretation have been discussed by petrov & herbig ( 1992 ) .",
    "the sample of classical fuors for which optical outbursts have actually been observed is small .",
    "these include fu ori itself , as well as v1057 cyg , v1515 cyg , and v1735 cyg .",
    "because of their unusual variability , the classical fuors have been extensively studied at optical , infrared , and submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "their properties are summarized by herbig ( 1966 , 1977 ) , hk96 , and sandell & weintraub ( 2001 ) .",
    "however , there have been no previous x - ray observations targeted specifically at classical fuors , and their x - ray properties are largely unknown.we have thus initiated a program aimed at searching for and characterizing their x - ray emission .",
    "we would like to know if the x - ray spectra of fuors are similar to classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) .",
    "both fuors and ctts are accreting low - mass pms stars , and the fuor v1057 cyg was a t tauri star before erupting in 1969 ( herbig 1977 ) .",
    "it is thus believed that fu ori - like outbursts represent a transient ( and possibly recurrent ) phase in the life of a t tauri star .",
    "we present here first results from x - ray observations of the prototype fu orionis .",
    "it brightened optically by about 6 magnitudes during 1936 - 1937 ( herbig 1966 ) and is still in slow decline .",
    "it has an optical spectrum and colors resembling an f - g supergiant , a near - ir excess , a high li abundance , and strong p cygni optical and uv line profiles indicative of mass loss , but no bipolar co outflow or hh objects have been detected ( hk96 ) .",
    "features associated with an expanding circumstellar shell are seen in the spectra ( herbig 1966 ) .",
    "a near - ir companion is present at an offset of 0.50@xmath8 ( 230 au at d = 460 pc ) and pa = 161@xmath9 ( wang et al .",
    "this object is about 4 mag fainter at k band than fu ori and has a near - ir excess , so is likely a pms star star ( reipurth & aspin 2004 ) .",
    "interferometry observations at h and k probe the star on au distance scales , showing evidence for an accretion disk with @xmath0 @xmath6 10@xmath2 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 and a mysterious hot spot located at a projected separation of 10 au ( malbet et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the physical origin of the hot spot is uncertain , but malbet et al .",
    "argue that it may be the signature of a very close companion .",
    "if so , this would make fu ori a triple system .",
    "we find that the x - ray spectrum of fu ori is quite unusual compared to what is typically observed in ctts .",
    "the spectrum does show the cool and hot components usually seen in ctts , but the components are viewed through different absorption columns .",
    "we discuss possible interpretations of the unusual spectrum and note qualitative similarities with the jet - driving t tauri star dg tau a.",
    "a short 16 ksec _ xmm - newton _ observation of fu ori was obtained on 8 march 2004 .",
    "fu ori was clearly detected but the observation was adversely affected by high background radiation ( skinner et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "we present here the results from a longer follow - up observation which began on 2005 april 3 at 15:36 ut and ended at 02:37 ut on april 4 .",
    "data were acquired with the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) , which provides ccd imaging spectroscopy from the pn camera ( strder et al .",
    "2001 ) and two nearly identical mos cameras ( mos1 and mos2 ; turner et al .",
    "the observation was obtained in full - window mode using the medium optical blocking filter .",

    "event files generated during the standard processing were filtered to select good event patterns .",
    "time filters were applied to remove segments of high background exposure .",
    "this yielded 26.9 ksec of low - background pn exposure ( including 20.9 ksec of contiguous data in the last half of the observation ) and 32.2 ksec of contiguous exposure per mos .",
    "spectra and light curves were extracted from a circular region of radius r@xmath11 = 15@xmath8 centered on fu ori , corresponding to @xmath668% encircled energy at 1.5 kev .",
    "background spectra and light curves were obtained from circular source - free regions near the source ( on the same ccd ) and were compared with background extracted from an annular region around the source .",
    "the derived results were not significantly affected by the region used to extract background .",
    "the mean pn background rate in the vicinity of fu ori measured during the usable periods of low - background exposure was 1.09 @xmath12 10@xmath13 c s@xmath4 arcsec@xmath14 ( 0.5 - 7 kev ) .",
    "the sas tasks _ rmfgen _ and _ arfgen _ were used to generate source - specific response matrix files ( rmfs ) and auxiliary response files ( arfs ) for spectral analysis .",

    "we find no other objects within 15@xmath8 of fu ori in the hst gsc 2.2 , usno b1.1 or 2mass data bases .",
    "thus , the x - ray emission most likely originates in fu ori but a contribution from the faint ir companion located 0.5@xmath8 to the south is not ruled out since _ xmm - newton _ can not spatially resolve the two .    since the x - ray spectrum shows both cool and hot plasma components ( sec .",
    "3.2 ) , we have measured the x - ray centroid positions in the combined mos 1 @xmath15 mos 2 image in the soft 0.5 - 2 kev and harder 2 - 7 kev bands .",
    "these measurements indicate that any offset between the soft and hard band positions is no larger than @xmath60.95@xmath8 , which is slightly less than the 1.1@xmath8 mos pixel size .",
    "higher angular resolution observations will be needed to determine if a sub - arcsecond offset is actually present .",
    "no large - amplitude flares are visible in the x - ray light curves .",
    "the last 20.9 ksec of contiguous low - background pn exposure gives a mean background - subtracted pn count rate of 7.2 c ksec@xmath4 ( 0.5 - 7 kev ; r@xmath11 = 15@xmath8 ) .",
    "a @xmath20 variability test on this 20.9 ksec segment binned at 2000 s intervals yields a probability of constant count rate p@xmath21 = 0.52 ( @xmath20/dof = 8.1/9 ) .",
    "the mos detectors are less affected by background flares and thus provide more usable exposure than the pn , but at lower count rates .",

    "based on the above analysis , there is no compelling evidence for x - ray variability in fu ori during the april 2005 observation .",
    "however , the epic pn fluxes of fu ori in this observation were about 50% larger than in the shorter march 2004 observation , as determined by the pipeline processing and our spectral analysis .",
    "it thus seems likely that fu ori did vary during the @xmath61 year time interval between the two observations .",
    "since the inferred variability is based on a comparison with high - background data acquired in march 2004 , further time monitoring would be useful to confirm the variability and constrain its timescale .",

    "the spectrum reveals a cool component below @xmath12 kev and a hotter component above @xmath12 kev .",
    "strong line emission from the fe k@xmath22 complex near 6.7 kev is clearly present .",
    "we discuss spectral models and plasma properties below .",
    "+      since cool and hot plasma are clearly present , we first attempted to fit the spectrum with a _ single - absorption _ two - temperature ( 2 t ) optically thin thermal plasma model .",
    "this model assumes that the emission is due to a multi - temperature plasma with a cool component at temperature kt@xmath23 and hotter component at kt@xmath24 , where both components are viewed through the same absorption column density n@xmath25 .",

    "spectral fits with this model can reproduce the hard part of the spectrum above @xmath62 kev with a high - temperature plasma kt@xmath24 @xmath6 7 kev and strong absorption n@xmath25 @xmath6 8 @xmath12 10@xmath27 cm@xmath14 .",
    "however , the overall fit is unacceptable ( reduced @xmath20 @xmath29 1.5 ) because the model flux is heavily attenuated below @xmath61 kev for reasonable values kt@xmath23 @xmath30 1 kev . as a result",
    ", the model fails to account for the emergent flux below @xmath61 kev that is clearly present in the observed spectrum .",
    "these results suggest that the cool plasma below @xmath61 kev is viewed through lower absorption than that inferred above for the hot plasma .",
    "the inability to reproduce the spectrum using a single - absorption 2 t model is somewhat surprising because the x - ray spectra of most tts can be reasonably well matched with this type of model , including tts in the orion region ( getman et al .",
    "2005 ) . however , it has recently been noted that such a model could not reproduce the x - ray spectrum of the jet - driving tts dg tau a ( gdel et al . 2005 ) . in that case ,",
    "an acceptable fit was obtained by allowing the absorption column density for each plasma component to be different .",
    "we thus attempted to fit the spectrum of fu ori using a _",
    "double - absorption _ model of the form n@xmath31@xmath26kt@xmath23 @xmath15 n@xmath32@xmath26kt@xmath24 .",
    "the double - absorption model yields very good results .",
    "table 1 gives best - fit parameters for this model when all abundances are held fixed at solar values ( model a ) referenced to anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) , and for the case where the fe abundances of both components are allowed to vary independently ( model b ) .",
    "the variable fe abundance model shown in figure 2 provides a slightly better fit than obtained with solar abundances , but this is accomplished by increasing the fe abundance of the hot component to a value greater than solar in order to reproduce the strong fe k line .",
    "figure 3 compares the fits to the fe k line obtained with solar abundances and an enhanced fe abundance .",
    "the temperature and absorption column density derived for the cool component from the above double - absorption models are quite reasonable .",
    "the temperature kt@xmath23 @xmath6 0.7 kev ( @xmath68 mk ) is typical of cool plasma detected in most tts in orion ( preibisch & feigelson 2005 ) .",
    "furthermore , the corresponding best - fit absorption from models a and b is in the range n@xmath31 @xmath6 ( 4.2 - 5.5 ) @xmath12 10@xmath33 cm@xmath14 , but with rather large uncertainties ( table 1 ) .",
    "the best - fit values equate to an extinction a@xmath34 @xmath6 1.9 - 2.5 mag using the n@xmath25 to a@xmath34 conversion given by gorenstein ( 1975 ) .",
    "these values are in good agreement with that determined from the color excess e(b",
    "@xmath35 v ) = 0.8 for fu ori ( herbig 1977 ) and with the values a@xmath34 = 2.4 mag ( adams , lada , & shu 1987 ) and a@xmath34 = 1.85 mag ( kenyon , hartmann , & hewett 1988 ) derived from fits of its spectral energy distribution .",
    "it thus seems very likely that we are detecting cool x - ray emission that originates in fu ori and is moderately absorbed by the same material that is responsible for the optical extinction .",
    "the temperature inferred for the hot component in the above double - absorption models is kt@xmath24 @xmath6 5.6 - 7.2 kev ( 65 - 83 mk ; table 1 ) .",
    "these temperatures are high but nevertheless within the range observed for magnetically - active tts in orion ( preibisch & feigelson 2005 ) .",
    "however , the absorption inferred for this hot component is much larger than anticipated from optical extinction estimates .",
    "the x - ray spectral fits from models a and b give n@xmath32 @xmath6 ( 8.4 - 12.8 ) @xmath12 10@xmath27 cm@xmath14 , which corresponds to a@xmath34 @xmath6 38 - 58 mag using gorenstein ( 1975 ) .",
    "the nature and location of the material responsible for the strong x - ray absorption are uncertain , but the apparent absence of such high absorption at visible wavelengths suggests that it is primarily gaseous .    although the above double - absorption model provides an acceptable fit to the spectrum , it may be overly simplistic in one respect .",
    "it assumes that the plasma viewed through low absorption is isothermal ( kt@xmath23 ) , and likewise for that viewed through high absorption ( kt@xmath24 ) .",
    "if the low or high absorption components ( or both ) originate in a multi - temperature corona , then it would be more physically realistic to replace kt@xmath23 with a multi - temperature plasma , and likewise for kt@xmath24 .",
    "we return to this issue in section 4.3 .",
    "the spectrum between 6 - 7 kev is dominated by strong fe line emission .",
    "the best - fit line centroid energy in the pn spectrum is e@xmath36 = 6.68 [ 6.56 - 6.75 ; 90% conf . ]",
    "kev , which is identified with the fe k shell complex including fe xxv .",
    "this line emits maximum power at t@xmath37 @xmath6 10@xmath38 k , providing unambiguous evidence for hot plasma .",
    "the fe k line flux accounts for about one - fourth of the observed flux in the 0.5 - 7 kev band ( table 1 ) .",
    "a weak feature is also seen near e @xmath6 7.79 kev as a 2@xmath39 excess in one bin ( fig .",
    "the feature is of low significance but if it is weak line emission the most likely candidate would be ni xxvii at lab energy e@xmath40 = 7.806 kev .",
    "a broad emission peak is also present near 0.8 - 1.1 kev .",
    "numerous fe and ne lines and the o viii ly@xmath41 line occupy this portion of the spectrum but these lines are not resolved at epic s spectral resolution .",
    "the value of the fe abundance for the cool component ( fe@xmath23 ) determined from the variable abundance model is quite uncertain but does converge to values at or slightly below solar ( model b in table 1 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , this model requires a high fe abundance for the hot component ( fe@xmath24 ) in order to accommodate the strong fe k line .",
    "the best - fit fe@xmath24 abundance depends somewhat on the amount of spectral binning used and we obtain values in the range fe@xmath24 = 2.20 - 2.78 @xmath12 solar ( table 1 notes ) .",
    "but , 90% confidence intervals do allow a value that is barely consistent with solar .",
    "these variable fe abundance fits constrain the width of the fe k line to its instrumentally - broadened value , but no significant differences in the fe@xmath24 abundance are found if the line width is allowed to vary .",
    "if the global metallicity @xmath42 is allowed to vary instead of just fe , then the derived absorption and temperatures are nearly identical to those of model b ( table 1 notes ) .",
    "the metallicity of the hot component is largely determined by the fe k line and likewise converges to a value above solar , but is barely consistent with solar at the lower 90% confidence bound .",
    "a weak excess above the continuum is present at 6.36 [ 6.30 - 6.42 ] kev , as can be seen in figure 3",
    ". this excess may be due to weak fluorescent fe i emission that would most likely originate in cool neutral material being illuminated by the high - temperature x - ray source .",
    "if an additional gaussian component at 6.36 kev is added to the thermal models in table 1 , a slight improvement in the fit is obtained and the reduced @xmath20 values decrease by 5% - 10% . adding",
    "the 6.36 kev gaussian line does not significantly affect the best - fit fe abundance of the hot component in the thermal models .    in summary , the x - ray spectra do not place a definitive constraint on the fe abundance of the cool plasma component .",
    "but if the emission is due to an optically thin plasma then the fe abundance of the hot component must be near - solar to account for the exceptionally strong fe k line .",
    "it seems quite unlikely that the fe abundance of the hot component in the fu ori spectrum is strongly depleted relative to the solar photospheric value , as has been found for some accreting t tauri stars ( kastner et al .",
    "2002 ; schmitt et al . 2005 ) . in a more general context ,",
    "previous studies of active late - type stars indicate that the coronal fe abundance is depleted relative to the solar photospheric value in some stars but not in others ( reviewed by gdel 2004 ) .",
    "because of the unusually hard continuum that is clearly present above 2 kev , we have also attempted to fit the spectrum using a hybrid model consisting of a cool lightly - absorbed optically thin thermal plasma plus a heavily - absorbed power - law continuum and a gaussian fe k line .",
    "the results of this model are given in table 1 as model d with components n@xmath31@xmath26kt@xmath23 @xmath15 n@xmath32@xmath26(pl @xmath15 gaus ) .",
    "interestingly , this hybrid model yields a better fit than that obtained above with two thermal components as measured by a reduced @xmath20 that is @xmath635% smaller .",
    "as figure 4 shows , much of this improvement comes from a tighter fit to the continuum above @xmath62 kev .",
    "there is very little change in the parameters derived for the cool plasma , but the inferred absorption for the hot plasma n@xmath32 is about a factor of two below that determined from the purely thermal models .",
    "even so , n@xmath32 is still an order of magnitude larger than expected for fu ori based on previously published a@xmath5 estimates .",
    "the width of the gaussian fe k line profile was allowed to vary in this hybrid model .",
    "when the pn spectrum is binned to a mimimum of 10 counts per bin the best - fit line width fwhm = 2.35  @xmath43 = 235 ev ( table 1 ) is slightly broader than the value fwhm @xmath6 160 ev expected for an instrumentally - broadened line at 6.7 kev , but the 90% confidence range is consistent with no excess broadening .",
    "this fit attempts to account for some of the excess near 6.4 kev by broadening the fe k line ( fig .",
    "4 inset ) and thus overestimates the true line width . if a second gaussian component is added to model the weak excess near 6.4 kev then the best - fit fe k line width is reduced to fwhm = 148 ev , consistent with an unbroadened line .",
    "thus , we find no strong evidence for non - instrumental broadening at fe k but higher energy resolution is needed to obtain a definitive line width measurement .",
    "thus , from the standpoint of goodness - of - fit , the hybrid thermal @xmath15 power - law model ( model d ) offers an improvement over the purely thermal models ( models a and b ) .",
    "however , either modeling strategy provides a statistically acceptable fit .",
    "a purely thermal model is more straightforward to interpret on physical grounds but we do comment further on the possibility of nonthermal emission in section 4.5 .",
    "it is well - known that the optical spectrum of fu ori shows complex two - component structure that can not be matched by the spectrum of a normal star ( herbig 1966 ) .",
    "we have found that its x - ray spectrum is also complex , consisting of cool and hot plasma components viewed through different absorption columns .",
    "we discuss possible interpretations below .",
    "the cool component could be coronal or shock - related , but the high temperature t@xmath24 @xmath6 65 - 83 mk determined from thermal fits of the hot component clearly points to a magnetic origin .",
    "the presence of a cool x - ray component viewed through an absorption column that is consistent with e(b@xmath35v ) estimates is not surprising .",
    "the inferred temperature kt@xmath23 @xmath6 0.7 kev ( t@xmath23 @xmath6 8 mk ) is very much in line with the cool x - ray emission detected in most tts . the ubiquity and stable temperature of this component in a large sample of orion tts were noted by preibisch & feigelson ( 2005 ) .",
    "this cool component is even present in active late - type coronal sources that are not accreting pms stars , and thus likely reflects underlying conditions in the magnetic corona .",
    "some ambiguity arises in the above interpretation because cool high - density plasma in an accretion shock could masquerade as cool coronal emission in accreting pms stars such as fu ori .",
    "higher energy resolution x - ray spectra are needed to obtain electron density estimates that can in principle be used to distinguish between high - density plasma in an accretion shock and lower density coronal plasma . however , the interpretation of x - ray emission line density diagnostics is not straightforward because ultraviolet radiation from the accretion shock can alter x - ray line flux ratios , thus mimicking high densities .",
    "in addition , it has recently been argued that soft accretion shock x - rays may not be detectable in sources accreting at rates @xmath0 @xmath7 10@xmath44 yr@xmath4 because the shock is buried too deeply in the star s atmosphere ( drake 2005 ) .",
    "the accretion rate of fu ori is thought to be several orders of magnitude above this limit ( malbet et al . 2005 ) , and the ability to detect accretion - induced x - rays in fu ori is thus questionable .",
    "finally we note that even though the temperature of the cool x - ray component determined from spectral fits has rather large uncertainties , the best - fit value kt@xmath23 @xmath6 0.7 kev is about twice as high as predicted from canonical accretion shock models using infall speeds of a few hundred km s@xmath4 ( ulrich 1976 ) .",
    "another possibility is that the cool x - ray component originates in a shocked jet or outflow at some distance from the star .",
    "this interpretation was put forward to explain the soft x - ray emission of dg tau a ( gdel et al . 2005 ) , which is known to drive a jet .",
    "however , no jet or strong collimated outflow has so far been found for fu ori .",
    "but , fu ori does have a strong wind and the wind speed inferred from its broad blueshifted h@xmath22 absorption feature is @xmath45 @xmath6 250 - 400 km s@xmath4 ( croswell et al . 1987 ) . if one assumes that a jet is present ( but as yet undetected ) at similar outflow speeds @xmath46",
    "@xmath6 @xmath45 , then the expected x - ray temperature for shocked jet emission is ( raga et al . 2002 ; gdel et al .",
    "2005 ) :   t@xmath47 = 1.5 @xmath12 10@xmath48(@xmath46/100 km s@xmath4)@xmath49  k @xmath6 0.94 - 2.4 mk , or kt @xmath6 0.08 - 0.21 kev .",
    "these shock temperatures are a factor of @xmath13 - 8 lower than the best - fit values for the cool component kt@xmath23 given in table 1 , but are barely consistent with the lower 90% confidence bound on kt@xmath23 .    given the above considerations , we find no strong reason at present to favor an accretion shock or shocked outflow interpretation for the cool x - ray emission of fu ori over the more conventional coronal interpretation . if higher resolution x - ray spectra and images are eventually obtained , the possibility of shock emission would be worth reconsidering .",
    "it is apparent from the spectral fits discussed above that the x - ray absorption toward fu ori is more complex than normally encountered in t tauri stars and a physical interpretation must account for two absorption components .",
    "more than one interpretation is possible because of the limited x - ray spatial resolution . since fu ori is a known multiple system ( sec .",
    "1 ) it may be that more than one star is contributing to the observed x - ray emission .",
    "another possibility is that we are detecting x - ray emission from a multi - temperature plasma ( such as a corona ) viewed through inhomogeneous absorption .",
    "evidence for patchy absorption toward fu ori has previously been mentioned by adams , lada , & shu ( 1987 ) .    to explore the coronal interpretation",
    ", we assume that the intrinsic x - ray emission arises in a multi - temperature corona with an admixture of cool ( kt@xmath50 ) and hot ( kt@xmath51 ) plasma , as is commonly the case in magnetically active pms stars .",
    "since fu ori is accreting and is surrounded by a disk viewed at an inclination angle @xmath52 @xmath6 55@xmath9 ( malbet et al . 2005 ) , some of the coronal emission may be obscured by material close to the star .",
    "this could be the disk or cold gas in the accretion stream .",
    "however , at @xmath52 @xmath6 55@xmath9 the entire corona would not necessarily be obscured .",
    "in particular , the polar region closest to the observer could incur very little disk obscuration , assuming a geometrically thin equatorial disk . and , if a bipolar outflow or jet is present ( or has been in the past ) then a low - density cavity might be evacuated near the poles ( clarke et al . 2005 ) , allowing softer coronal photons to escape .",
    "however , coronal emission from subpolar latitudes could suffer heavy disk obscuration or strong absorption from cold accreting gas that impacts the star at subpolar latitudes .",
    "we represent the above picture with a model of the form n@xmath31@xmath26(kt@xmath23 @xmath15 kt@xmath24 ) @xmath15",
    "n@xmath32@xmath26(kt@xmath23 @xmath15 kt@xmath24 ) .",
    "this model accounts for the multi - temperature structure that is expected for coronal plasma and assumes that a fraction of the coronal emission is viewed through relatively low absorption ( n@xmath31 ) and the remainder through high absorption ( n@xmath32 ) .",
    "the above model is referred to as model c in table 1 .",
    "it has four normalization parameters .",
    "the low absorption component has a normalization parameter for the cool plasma norm@xmath53 and for the hot plasma norm@xmath54 .",
    "likewise , the high - absorption component has norms norm@xmath55 and norm@xmath56 . when fitting the x - ray spectrum , all norms are allowed to vary independently except for norm@xmath55 which is constrained to be norm@xmath55 = [ norm@xmath53/norm@xmath54]@xmath12norm@xmath56 .",
    "that is , we require the ratio of the norms , or equivalently , the emission measures , of the cool to hot plasma be the same in both the low and high absorption components .",
    "this would be expected if the emission seen through low and high absorption originates in the same structure ( e.g. a multi - temperature corona ) .",
    "we choose to constrain norm@xmath55 because this component is the least well - determined observationally .",
    "almost all softer x - ray photons from the cool plasma component that pass through the high - absorption column will be absorbed and thus absent from the observed spectrum .",
    "as the results in table 1 show , model c gives a slightly better fit to the pn spectrum than do models a or b. even so , there is very little change in the derived absorption , temperatures , and fe abundance . the primary difference between model c and models a / b is in the underlying physical picture .",
    "model c is based on the premise that the observed spectrum arises from viewing a single multi - temperature source through an inhomogeneous absorber .",
    "thus , the emission detected through low absorption is an admixture of cool and hot plasma , as is that detected through high absorption .",
    "another notable difference is that the x - ray luminosity inferred from model c is higher than that of the other models .",
    "nevertheless , the value l@xmath58 = 1.7 @xmath12 10@xmath59 ergs s@xmath4 ( 0.5 - 7 kev ) from model c is within the range observed for other low - mass pms stars in orion ( getman et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the relative contributions of cool and hot plasma to the total emission measure derived from model c are somewhat uncertain , but the spectral fits suggest that they could be roughly equal . however , the total emission measure of the plasma viewed through high absorption is at least an order of magnitude larger than that detected through low absorption .",
    "thus , if the emission does arise in a multi - temperature corona then the corona is almost totally obscured and only a small fraction of the softer coronal emission manages to escape .",
    "it is not yet clear what would create the escape path but clumpy absorption , scattering , or a low - density cavity evacuated by an existing or fossil jet or collimated outflow are possibilities .",
    "the column density of the heavily - absorbed component determined from model c is n@xmath32 = 10.6 @xmath12 10@xmath27 cm@xmath14 .",
    "this includes the small contribution n@xmath25 @xmath6 0.4 @xmath12 10@xmath27 cm@xmath14 that is known to be present based on the optical extinction .",
    "the excess absorption of the hot component is then n@xmath60 = 10.2 @xmath12 10@xmath27 cm@xmath14 .",
    "if the accretion column is responsible for this excess , then we can take the minimum inner disk radius r@xmath61 = 5.5 r@xmath3 = 3.8 @xmath12 10@xmath62 cm ( malbet et al . 2005 ) as the approximate length of the absorption column .",
    "realistically , this value should be interpreted as an upper limit because viewing geometry considerations make it unlikely that we are looking through the entire length of the accretion column .",
    "thus , if the strong absorption is due to accreting gas then the mean number density in the accretion column is n@xmath25 @xmath7 3 @xmath12 10@xmath62 @xmath63 .      in the above",
    ", it was assumed that the accretion flow is primarily responsible for the heavy x - ray absorption .",
    "however , the strong stellar wind of fu ori may also contribute .",
    "radiative transfer models that assume rapid wind acceleration give a high mass loss rate for fu ori of @xmath64 @xmath1 10@xmath65 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 and p - cygni type h@xmath22 absorption features imply a terminal wind speed v@xmath66 @xmath6 250 - 400 km s@xmath4 ( croswell et al .",
    "there is some evidence that the wind arises from the surface of the accretion disk ( calvet , hartmann , & kenyon 1993 ) .    a _ vla _ radio observation did not detect fu ori with a 3@xmath39 upper limit on its 3.6 cm flux density s@xmath67 @xmath30 0.05 mjy ( rodriguez , hartmann , & chavira 1990 ) .",
    "assuming a spherically - symmetric wind with temperature t@xmath68 @xmath6 5000 k ( croswell et al . 1987 ) , v@xmath66 = 400 km s@xmath4 , and a distance of 460 pc , the radio non - detection gives an upper limit on the _ ionized _ mass - loss rate @xmath69 @xmath30 4.4 @xmath12 10@xmath70 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 ( eq . [ 7 ] of skinner , brown , & stewart 1993 ) .",
    "thus , the high mass - loss rate derived by crosswell et al . ( 1987 ) can only be reconciled with the radio data if the wind is largely neutral .    the predicted neutral hydrogen column density along the line - of - sight toward the star for a spherically - symmetric homogeneous wind with mass loss rate @xmath64 = 10@xmath65 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 , terminal speed v@xmath66 = 400 km s@xmath4 , and stellar radius r@xmath71 @xmath6 4 r@xmath3 ( calvet et al . 1993 ) is n@xmath72 @xmath1 10@xmath73 cm@xmath14 this is about ten times larger than that determined for the heavily - absorbed component in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the x - ray data could be brought into agreement with the predicted n@xmath72 if the mass - loss rate were about an order of magnitude smaller , that is @xmath64 @xmath1 10@xmath13 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 .",
    "the mass loss rate determined from radiative transfer models is known to be sensitive to the poorly - known wind temperature and wind velocity profile , and if the wind is slowly accelerated then lower mass loss rates are possible and @xmath64 @xmath1 10@xmath13 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 is not out of the question ( croswell et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "if the strong x - ray absorption is indeed due to fu ori s massive wind , then an additional question arises . where does the cool component in the x - ray spectrum originate ? if it is cool coronal emission that originates close to the star , then it must somehow escape through the wind without being totally absorbed .",
    "this would seemingly require either an inhomogeneous wind or a non - spherical wind geometry that allows some soft coronal photons to reach the observer . here",
    ", it is worth mentioning that a slowly accelerating non - spherical collimated flow was mentioned by croswell et al . as a possible solution to matching the observed optical line properties of fu ori , including the absence of redshifted emission . on the other hand ,",
    "if the simplistic picture of a spherically - symmetric homogenous wind is approximately correct then a caculation of the radius of x - ray optical depth unity in the wind shows that the cool x - ray emission must emerge far from the star",
    ".      it may be that more than one x - ray source is contributing to the observed spectrum .",
    "this is conceivable since fu ori is known to be a double or perhaps even a triple system .",
    "if each component has a disk and the disks are viewed at different inclination angles ( or if one star is viewed through the disk of another ) , then multiple absorption components would be expected .",
    "it seems unlikely that the hard heavily - absorbed x - ray component originates in the near - ir companion 0.5@xmath8 away if its extinction is only a@xmath34 @xmath6 1.1 mag ( wang et al .",
    "the extinction toward the hard x - ray component is much higher ( sec .",
    "3.2.1 ) . assuming that the extinction toward the near - ir companion has not been underestimated , we are left with the intriguing possibility that the hard x - rays arise in a third heavily - obscured magnetically - active component lying very close to fu ori .",
    "this component could be related to the hotspot detected in the interferometer observations of malbet et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , or perhaps an object embedded in the disk of fu ori .",
    "it has been suggested that the periodic h@xmath22 emission of fu ori might be induced by a low - mass protostar or protoplanet in the disk ( vittone & errico 2005 ) .",
    "binarity might at first glance seem to provide an attractive explanation for the unusual double - absorption spectrum of fu ori .",
    "but , the binary hypothesis is not a panacea .",
    "work in progress indicates that the ctts gv tau a also has a double - absorption x - ray spectrum , but a _ chandra _ observation shows that a known protostellar companion does not contribute to the x - ray emission ( gdel et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "unless an additional companion is present much closer to the star , these results suggest that other factors besides binarity will be needed to fully explain the double absorption spectra .",
    "the improvement in the fit to the hard component of the fu ori spectrum that results from replacing the optically thin plasma model with a power - law @xmath15 gaussian fe k line model is substantial ( table 1 ) .",
    "this result is somewhat surprising , but some caution is warranted since it is based on the analysis of a relatively low signal - to - noise ccd spectrum .",
    "although hard power - law x - ray continua are often seen in strongly - accreting compact objects , there is little observational support to date for power - law x - ray emission from magnetically active late - type stars ( gdel 2004 ) .",
    "a possible exception is ab dor , for which a nonthermal x - ray continuum excess was postulated to explain a weak fe k line in the presence of x - ray flares ( vilhu et al .",
    "1993 ) .    however , the situation encountered for fu ori is different than for ab dor .",
    "there is no evidence for strong x - ray flaring in the fu ori light curve and the fe k emission line is unusually strong , rather than weak .",
    "it is thus difficult to argue that any existing power - law emission is related to large x - ray flares . as mentioned above ( sec .",
    "4.3.1 ) , a previous _ vla _ radio observation failed to detect fu ori at 3.6 cm down to rather low limits .",
    "thus , we have no radio evidence for the existence of a population of nonthermal particles in the magnetosphere .",
    "even so , additional centimeter radio observations at longer wavelengths might be worthwhile since nonthermal radio flux density typically increases with wavelength .",
    "if a power - law component is present , then magnetic accretion might provide an alternative explanation .",
    "lamzin ( 1999 ) has discussed the possibility of nonthermal x - ray emission in accreting pms stars . if the density of the infalling gas drops below @xmath74 @xmath6 10@xmath62 @xmath63",
    ", then protons can gyrate many times around a magnetic field line before a collision , and the accretion shock passes into the collisionless regime . in that case , the particle distribution is non - maxwellian and excess hard x - ray emission can be produced .    at present , the absence of strong x - ray flares and the lack of a radio detection of fu ori , along with the strong fe k line , suggest that the x - ray emission is predominantly thermal .",
    "a higher signal - to - noise spectrum will be needed to distinguish between purely thermal models and models that invoke a hard power - law continuum .",
    "the double - absorption x - ray spectrum of fu ori is unusual compared to most tts , but in some respects does resemble that of the jet - driving ctts dg tau a ( gdel et al . 2005 ) .",
    "however , there are also notable differences",
    ". the spectrum of dg tau a does not show a strong fe k line as is present in fu ori , and there is no evidence to date that fu ori has a jet - like outflow .",
    "if the cool low - absorption x - ray emission detected in dg tau a is related to a shocked jet ( gdel et al . 2005 ) then it is not obvious that this interpretation applies to fu ori as well .",
    "in general , the existing data give little reason to invoke shock - induced x - rays to explain the emission in the fu ori spectrum , despite the belief that it is accreting at high rates .",
    "clearly , higher angular resolution observations would be useful to determine if the soft emission is slightly offset from the star , as might be the case if it originates in a shocked jet or outflow . a higher angular resolution _",
    "observation might also shed light on whether the faint near - ir companion located 0.5@xmath8 south of fu ori contributes to the x - ray emission .",
    "the overall temperature structure of the fu ori spectrum strongly resembles that seen in active late - type coronal sources , including magnetically - active pms stars .",
    "thus , a coronal origin seems likely , at least for the hot plasma component . assuming that the emission is coronal",
    ", then the nature and location of the material responsible for the strong absorption of the hard x - ray component remains the most intriguing question .",
    "either cold accreting gas or a strong neutral wind are the most likely candidates , but an inhomogenous absorber or non - spherical geometries are needed if both the cool and hot plasma originate close to the star .    even though fu ori is the prototype , it would be premature to conclude that its unusual x - ray properties are representative of the class of fuors as a whole .",
    "prototypes can show extreme or unusual behavior and t tauri itself is a well - known example .",
    "additional observations of other fuors are needed to define the x - ray properties of the class and such observations are now pending .",
