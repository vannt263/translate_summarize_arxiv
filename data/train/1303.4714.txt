    "the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) is a 6 m , off - axis telescope designed for millimeter wavelength observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) with arcminute resolution @xcite .",
    "the telescope is located in northern chile , at an elevation of 5190  m , where atmospheric conditions are excellent for microwave observations from april through december . from 2008 to 2010 , act observed the sky with bolometer arrays operating in frequency bands centered at 148ghz , 218ghz and 277ghz .",
    "the choice of bands provides the ability , in principle , to spectrally discriminate between signal from the cmb , the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and dusty sources .",
    "the 148ghz array was also in operation during a short observing season at the end of 2007 .",
    "the act scientific program has produced measurements of the cmb angular power spectrum at multipoles spanning @xmath8 to 10000 @xcite , probing the primary and secondary anisotropies @xcite .",
    "act has produced source catalogs @xcite , and galaxy cluster samples reaching to high redshifts @xcite .",
    "the telescope beam acts as a low - pass spatial filter on the astrophysical signal from the sky .",
    "the effects of this filtering are relevant , to varying degrees , to all act science results .",
    "interpretation of the angular power spectrum , in particular , relies on its decomposition into components that are correlated across large ranges in angular scale .",
    "the extraction of cosmological parameters associated with such components depends on an understanding of the beam shape and the covariant features of the window function uncertainty .    in this work",
    "we describe the processing of planet observations to obtain the telescope beams , and thus the instrument window function , for each detector array for each season of operation .",
    "we also discuss the use of uranus observations to monitor beam shape and calibration .",
    "because the act maps are ultimately calibrated to the cmb blackbody via the dipole calibration of wmap @xcite , we obtain precise measurements of the uranus and saturn disk temperatures without resorting to interpolation across unknown source spectra or other calibration transfer standards .",
    "a detailed description of the instrument can be found in @xcite , and the main data reduction and map - making pipeline is described in @xcite . @xcite",
    "present an analysis of the act beams from the 2008 season ; the present approach extends this earlier analysis .    in section  [ sec : observations ] of this paper we discuss the planet observations and maps . in section  [ sec :",
    "beams ] we obtain the telescope window function through an analysis of the planet maps and the application of corrections for several systematic effects . in section  [ sec : calibration ] , we interpret the apparent brightness of uranus to calibrate the sensitivity of the telescope to atmospheric water vapor and focus variation . in section  [ sec : brightness ] we use the cmb - based calibration of the act maps to obtain absolutely calibrated measurements of uranus and saturn brightness temperatures",
    "the act observation strategy is to scan over small ranges of azimuth angle while keeping the boresight altitude fixed at @xmath9 to minimize systematic effects due to altitude variation .",
    "the cmb fields are observed as they rise and set through two central azimuth pointings .",
    "planet observations are made at this same telescope altitude angle , by briefly interrupting cmb survey scans and re - pointing in azimuth to the planet location .",
    "act observed a planet approximately once per night of operation in 20072010 , but only high quality observations of saturn and uranus are considered in this analysis .",
    "saturn and uranus were preferentially targeted , as saturn s brightness makes it useful for beam profile measurements , and uranus stable brightness is a convenient calibration source . while uranus was visible throughout each observing season , saturn was available only at the beginning and end of each season .",
    "jupiter and mars were , respectively , too bright and too low in the sky to be useful for calibration work . in table",

    "the bolometer time stream data for planet observations are pre - processed in a similar fashion to the cmb survey data .",
    "the time stream data are calibrated , based on detector load curves , after deconvolving the effects of the detector time constants and low - pass readout filtering .",
    "detectors are then screened for quality based on their projections onto a common - mode computed using a fiducial set of well - behaved detectors .",
    "detector screening is performed with the planetary signal masked out .",
    "maps are made using a dedicated code that is optimized for high resolution mapping of single observations ; we have confirmed that the main season map pipeline code produces compatible results when run on the same data .",
    "each map is solved iteratively , converging after fewer than 10 iterations .",
    "the noise model is designed to remove common - mode signal at frequencies below 0.2 hz , corresponding to angular scales that are much larger than the array size .",
    "because high - pass filtering of this kind may suppress signal at large angular scales , we study the transfer function of the map making solutions in section  [ sec : sys_mapping ] .      while planets were observed almost every night , observations do not always yield successful maps .",
    "the primary reason for failed mapping is a low number of live detectors during periods of high sky loading .",
    "this is a greater problem at higher frequencies , and for the 277ghz array in particular leads to many maps with incomplete sampling of the planet signal ; such maps are discarded .",
    "planet observations are sometimes made after sunrise .",
    "while such observations allow us to study the magnitude of pointing and beam focus changes due to thermal deformation of the telescope structure , they are excluded from the present analysis .",
    "the sunrise cut is also applied to cmb observations .",
    "a small number of maps are cut due to having substantially higher noise levels than other maps of the same planet for the same array and season .",
    "the remaining maps are used to establish the telescope beam and calibration parameters , as described in the following sections .",
    "season mean beam maps , obtained by aligning and averaging the selected saturn maps for each season and array , are shown in figure  [ fig : beam_maps ] .",
    "the airy pattern is easily seen in the maps at 148ghz and 218ghz .",
    "the horizontal streaks are parallel to the telescope scan direction . +",
    "in this section we obtain measurements of the telescope beams for each season and array .",
    "saturn is bright and much smaller than the beam solid angle , permitting the characterization of our beams with high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "saturn maps are reduced to radial profiles , which are then modeled with appropriately chosen basis functions and transformed to fourier space .",
    "the resulting transform , the beam modulation transfer function , is corrected for a number of systematic effects to produce a window function and @xmath10-space covariance suitable for use with the act cmb survey maps .",
    "while the instantaneous act beams are slightly ( @xmath11 ) elliptical in cross - section , we analyze them as though they were circular , and work exclusively with the `` symmetrized '' ( i.e. , azimuthally averaged ) radial profiles .",
    "the resulting beam measurements are suitable for any analysis that incorporates a similar simple azimuthal average of the signal under study .",
    "in particular , the cross - linking of cmb survey observations is such that the telescope beam contributes to the map , with roughly equal weight , at two orientations that differ in rotation by approximately 90 degrees ; the net effective beam is very nearly circular .",
    "the goal of our analysis is thus to characterize the symmetrized beam .",
    "radial profiles are obtained for each saturn observation by averaging map data in radial annuli of width 9 , producing average profile measurements @xmath12 at radii @xmath13 . on scales smaller than a few arcminutes ,",
    "the covariant noise is sub - dominant to the planetary signal and thus the shape of the core beam is very well measured by even a single observation of saturn .",
    "however , at larger angular scales there is non - negligible contamination from the atmosphere .",
    "this means that the asymptotic behavior of the beam can not be separated from the fluctuating background without making some assumptions about the beam behavior far from the main lobe .",
    "the illumination of the act optics is controlled by a cryogenic lyot stop at an image of the circular exit pupil ; this leads to a beam shape described by an airy pattern ( for monochromatic radiation ) and to the expectation that the beam pattern ( including the effects of finite detector size and spectral response ) will decay asymptotically as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the angle from the beam peak .",
    "we fit this model to the radial profile data in order to fix the background level of the map and to provide a model for extrapolating the beam to large angles .",
    "the background level of the map and the large - angle behavior of the beam are measured by fitting the model @xmath16 to the binned profile data in the range @xmath17 , with the range chosen such that the profile measurements have fallen to below 1% of the peak but are still signal dominated .",
    "the points @xmath12 with @xmath18 , corrected for the background level @xmath19 and renormalized so that @xmath20 , constitute the `` core '' of the beam profile . the radial profile beyond @xmath21",
    "is referred to as the `` wing . ''",
    "the fit ranges used for each array , and the amplitude of the beam at @xmath21 relative to the peak , are given in table  [ tab : beam_props ] .",

    "the act beams are sufficiently concentrated that we may work in a flat sky approximation and take @xmath15 to be a radial coordinate in the plane .",
    "the radial component of the fourier conjugate variable will be @xmath10 .",

    "the resulting beam transforms are shown in figure  [ fig : beam_panels ] .",
    "while the beams for the 2008 season are shown , the beam features are not substantially different between seasons .",
    "the figure shows the separate contributions of the core and wing to the beam transform .",
    "the wing contributes significantly only at low @xmath10 ( i.e. , below 1000 at 148ghz , and below 2000 at 218ghz and 277ghz ) .",
    "while this is very similar to the procedure described in @xcite , in this work we include covariance between radial profile data points , and between the radial profile and the wing fit parameter .",
    "this results in a natural propagation of beam errors on all spatial scales into the fitted beam transform and its @xmath10-space covariance matrix .",
    "our treatment of beam errors is discussed in the next section .      using the covariance matrix of the fit coefficients obtained in section  [ sec : radial_profiles ]",

    "this covariance matrix is an @xmath10-space representation of the covariant features in the radial profiles that contribute to the @xmath47 .",
    "however , because the calibration of the cmb survey maps is established at a particular angular scale , we must recast the beam covariance into an appropriate form .",
    "this is effectively the same procedure applied in @xcite .",
    "the absolute calibration of the act maps at 148ghz is obtained by cross - correlation of the 2008 southern and 2010 equatorial maps with the wmap 7-year maps @xcite at 94  ghz of the same sky region , over angular scales with @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "this leads to an absolute calibration of the act maps centered near @xmath74 .",
    "the 2009 season equatorial maps at 148ghz are then calibrated , over @xmath75 , to the 2010 season equatorial maps .",
    "the subsequent calibration of the 218ghz maps to the 148ghz maps is performed in the signal - dominated regime with @xmath76 .",
    "the 277ghz maps have not yet been calibrated to wmap . for each season and array , we factor out the beam amplitude at effective calibration scale @xmath77 , where @xmath78 for the 148ghz array , and @xmath79 for the 218ghz and 277ghz arrays .    for a celestial temperature signal described by multipole moments",
    "@xmath80 , we measure a map @xmath81 in detector power units , which is related to @xmath82 by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the product of the beam ( normalized such that @xmath85 ) and a global calibration factor @xmath86 that converts cmb temperature to map units ( i.e. , to detector power units ) .",
    "our calibration to wmap is a comparison of @xmath87 and @xmath82 at @xmath88 and is thus a measurement of @xmath89 that is independent of our beam uncertainty .",
    "this leads us to recast equation  ( [ eqn : mfromt ] ) as @xmath90 where @xmath91 since the errors in @xmath92 and @xmath89 are not correlated , the uncertainty in @xmath93 is described by a covariance matrix @xmath94 that is the sum of a calibration error from the measurement of @xmath89 , and a term due to correlated error in the @xmath92 : @xmath95.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the term in square brackets is the normalized beam covariance that accompanies act data releases .",
    "the diagonal beam error ( i.e. , the square root of the diagonal entries of the normalized beam covariance ) is shown for each season and array in figure  [ fig : beam_panels ] . at high @xmath10 ,",
    "the error in the effective season beam is dominated by an empirical map - based correction , which is not included here ( see section  [ sec : effective_beam ] ) .",
    "while the fitted beam and covariance are an accurate description of the binned radial beam profile , they must be corrected for a number of systematic effects prior to being used to interpret act maps .",
    "the beams computed in the preceding section are corrected for a number of systematic effects that would otherwise bias the resulting transforms relative to the true telescope beam .",
    "these are briefly described below .",
    "because our map - making procedure includes time domain high - pass filtering , we might expect poor reproduction of large spatial scales .",
    "we study the mapping transfer function by injecting a simulated signal into telescope time stream data and comparing the output map to the input map in fourier space .",
    "the transfer function deviates significantly from unity only on angular scales larger than 20 .",
    "the wing fit is performed at somewhat smaller radii than this , and we have confirmed that the wing fit and extrapolation reproduces the input signal , on all scales , to 0.1% .",
    "a very small ( @xmath960.1% ) correction due to the 3.5 pixelization of the planet maps is applied by dividing the beam transform by the azimuthal average of the analytic pixel window function .",
    "the binning of the planet map pixel data into annuli has a slight impact on the inferred beam transform .",
    "this is quantified by evaluating the harmonic transform of data points taken from a model of the radial beam profile , and comparing it to the harmonic transform of points that include simulated binning of the radial beam profile .",
    "this resulting correction is approximately 1% at @xmath97 .",
    "the saturn angular diameter of approximately 8 is large enough that we do not treat it as a point source . for each season and array , we deconvolve saturn s shape assuming that it is a disk with solid angle equal to the mean solid angle for all saturn observations that contribute to the mean instantaneous beam measurement .",
    "this correction is approximately 2% at @xmath97 .",
    "while saturn s rings complicate the spatial distribution of the planetary signal , these effects are negligible at @xmath98 , aside from an overall change in average brightness , and need not be considered in the deconvolution procedure .",
    "after applying the corrections described in section  [ sec : corrections ] , the resulting beam describes the telescope response to a point - like radiation source with approximately rayleigh - jeans spectrum , averaged over the focal plane of each array .",
    "we refer to this beam as the `` mean instantaneous beam , '' to emphasize that the combination of observations taken at many different times may lead to an effective window function that is different from the instantaneous one .    for use in particular contexts , we compute an effective beam that includes corrections for alternative frequency spectra , and for pointing variation or other cumulative effects resulting from the combination of observations taken at many different times .    we apply a simple first - order correction to obtain the effective beam for different radiation spectra . for radiation with a band effective frequency @xmath99 ,",
    "the beam is taken to be @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the effective frequency for radiation with a rayleigh - jeans ( rj ) spectrum .",
    "effective frequencies for various spectral types are presented in @xcite .    in the absence of planetary sources ,",
    "the absolute pointing registration of individual act observations is not known .",
    "since each pixel of the act survey maps contains contributions from data acquired on many different nights throughout each season , the resulting season effective beam for these maps is less sharp than the instantaneous beam obtained from carefully aligned individual planet observations .",
    "pointing repeatability can be estimated from the variation in apparent planet positions , relative to expectations , in each season and array .",
    "as summarized in table  [ tab : pointing ] , these indicate that the repeatability of telescope pointing is at the @xmath102 to 8 ( rms ) level . pointing variation in cmb observations",
    "may in principle be smaller than @xmath103 , since cmb observations are performed at the same azimuth angles each night , while planets observations span a wider range of azimuths .",
    "in addition to pointing repeatability , the season effective beam may also be diluted due to errors in the global pointing model , which is used to combine observations made at different azimuth angles .",
    "these global adjustments are estimated using point source positions measured in ( non - cross - linked ) maps made from only rising or only setting data .    while pointing variance and global alignment may contribute to dilution of the season beam",
    ", we must also acknowledge that the beam may change slightly over the course of the season in a way that is not captured by the saturn observations .",
    "( changes in the beam over the course of the season , and the resulting impact on calibration , are assessed using uranus observations in section  [ sec : calibration ] . )",
    "we thus seek an empirical measure of the difference between the season effective beam and the instantaneous beam obtained from saturn observations .",
    "we parametrize the difference between the season effective beam @xmath104 and the instantaneous beam @xmath47 as a gaussian in @xmath10 : @xmath105 if the correction is interpreted as arising purely from gaussian pointing error , then @xmath106 is simply the pointing variance in square radians . while this motivates the form of the correction , our broader interpretation permits @xmath106 to differ from the value expected based on pointing variance measured from planets , or to be less than zero if the season effective beam is somewhat sharper than the ensemble of saturn observations indicates",
    "we measure @xmath106 for each season and array using bright point sources in the season cmb survey maps .",
    "point sources with signal to noise ratios greater than 10 are identified using a matched filter .",
    "a beam model is fit to the map in the vicinity of each source , producing a value of @xmath106 .",
    "the weighted mean and error of these individual fits , for each season and array , are used to form the effective beam for use with the survey maps .",
    "while this point source analysis gives us a secondary probe of the beam core , we note that the saturn observations are still key for measuring the behavior in the wings of the beam .",
    "the values of the season correction parameter @xmath106 are presented in table  [ tab : pointing ] .",
    "the measurement of @xmath106 is somewhat susceptible to changes in the fitting parameters and thus the quoted errors have been inflated from the formal values by factors of 2 and 6 for the 148ghz and 218ghz arrays , respectively . while values of @xmath106 for the 148ghz array are very similar between seasons , values for 218ghz are more variable .",
    "the analysis of uranus observations in section  [ sec : brightness_measurements ] shows that in 2010 the telescope beam was more sharply focused , relative to the mean beam estimated from saturn , during most of the observing season ( see section  [ sec : brightness_measurements ] ) ; this results in a negative value for @xmath106 at 218ghz .",
