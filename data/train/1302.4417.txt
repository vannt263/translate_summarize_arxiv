    "<S> for the two separated subprocesses , i.e. the transition from state 1 to state 0 and the transition from state 0 to state 0 , the jarzynski equality does not hold but the generalized version links the work done on the system to the probability that it returns to its initial state under the time - reversed procedure .    </S>",

    "<S> principle @xcite is very important as it states that for any irreversible logical operation the minimum amount of entropy production is @xmath0 per bit commuted by the logical operation , with @xmath1 the boltzmann constant . </S>",
    "<S> specifically a logically irreversible operation is an operation for which the knowledge of the output does not allow to retrieve the initial state , examples are logical and , or and erasure . in a recent paper @xcite we have experimentally shown that indeed the minimum amount of work necessary to erase a bit is actually associated with this landauer s bound which can be asymptotically reached for adiabatic transformations . </S>",
    "<S> the question that arises naturally is whether this work corresponds to the free energy difference between the initial and final state of the system . to answer to this question it seems natural to use the jarzinsky equality @xcite which allows one to compute the free energy difference between two states of a system , in contact with a heat bath at temperature @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> when such a system is driven from an equilibrium state a to a state b through any continuous procedure , the jarzynski equality links the stochastic work @xmath3 received by the system during the procedure to the free energy difference @xmath4 between the two states : @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the ensemble average over all possible trajectories , and @xmath7 ( see eq . </S>",

    "<S> the setup has already been described in a previous article @xcite and we recall here only the main features .    a custom - built vertical optical tweezers is used to realize a two - state system : a silica bead ( radius @xmath9 ) is trapped at the focus of a laser beam ( wavelength @xmath10 ) which is rapidly switched ( at a rate of @xmath11 ) between two positions ( separated by @xmath12 ) using an acousto - optic deflector . a disk - shaped cell ( @xmath13 in diameter , @xmath14 in depth ) </S>",
    "<S> is filled with a solution of beads dispersed in bidistilled water at low concentration . </S>",
    "<S> the bead used for the experiment is trapped by the laser and moved into the center of the cell ( with gap @xmath15 ) to avoid all interactions with other beads . </S>",
    "<S> the trapped bead feels a double - well potential with a central barrier varying from @xmath16 to more than @xmath17 depending on the power of the laser ( see figure [ fig : potential ] , * a * and * b * ) . </S>",
    "<S> the left well is called `` 0 '' and the right well `` 1 '' . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the bead is tracked using a fast camera with a resolution of @xmath18 per pixel , which after treatment gives the position with a precision greater than @xmath19 . </S>",

    "<S> the potential is computed from the equilibrium probability density function of the bead s position.,width=302 ]    the logical operation performed by our experiment is the erasure procedure . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure brings the system initially in one random state ( 0 or 1 with same probability ) in one chosen state ( e.g. 0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is done experimentally in the following way .    at the beginning </S>",
    "<S> the laser power is high ( @xmath24 ) so that the central barrier is more than @xmath25 and the characteristic jumping time ( kramers time ) is about @xmath26 , which is long compared to the time of the experiment , and the bead is trapped in one well - defined state ( 0 or 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the laser power is first lowered ( in a time @xmath27 ) to @xmath28 so that the barrier is about @xmath29 and the jumping time falls to @xmath30 . a viscous drag force linear in time </S>",
    "<S> is induced by displacing the cell with respect to the laser using a closed - loop 3-axis nanomax stage . </S>",
    "<S> the force is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 ( @xmath33 is the viscosity of water ) and @xmath34 the speed of displacement . </S>",

    "<S> the force is stopped and the central barrier is raised again to its maximal value ( in a time @xmath35 ) . between two successive procedures the system </S>",
    "<S> is left to equilibrate for 4 @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental procedure is sketched in figure [ fig : schema_procedure ] . </S>",
    "<S> a procedure is fully characterized by its duration @xmath37 and the maximum value of the force applied @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> its efficiency is characterized by the `` proportion of success '' @xmath39 , which is the proportion of trajectories where the bead ends in the chosen well ( e.g. 0 ) , independently of where it started .        </S>",
    "<S> the ideal erasure procedure is a logically irreversible operation because the final state gives no information about the initial state . for one bit of memory @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it corresponds to a change in the entropy of the system @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure can arbitrarily be decomposed in two kinds of sub - procedures : one where the bead starts in one well and ends in the other ( e.g. @xmath41 ) and one where the bead is initially in the same well where it should be at the end of the procedure ( e.g. @xmath42 ) .    the two accessible quantifies are @xmath43 , which is measured , and @xmath44 which is imposed by the displacement of the cell . </S>",

    "<S> only one value is shown for each @xmath37 : it corresponds to the procedure with the highest proportion of success @xmath39.,width=302 ]    these results can be understood in the following way : since the memory erasure procedure is made in a cyclic way and @xmath85 it is natural to await @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> but the @xmath8 that appears in the jarsynski equality is the difference between the free energy of the system in the initial state ( which is at equilibrium ) and the equilibrium state corresponding to the final value of the control parameter : @xmath87 . </S>",

    "<S> nevertheless vaikuntanathan and jarzysnki @xcite have shown that when there is a difference between the actual state of the system ( described by the phase - space density @xmath90 ) , and the equilibrium state ( described by @xmath91 ) , the jarzynski equality should be modified : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the mean on all the trajectories that pass through @xmath94 at @xmath95 .    in our procedure </S>",
    "<S> , the selection of the trajectories where the information is actually erased , corresponds to fix @xmath94 to the chosen final well ( e.g. state 0 ) at the time @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that @xmath96 is directly @xmath97 , the proportion of success of the procedure , and @xmath98 . then : @xmath99 similarly for the trajectories that end the procedure in the wrong well ( e.g. state 1 ) we have : @xmath100 taking into account the jensen s inequality , i.e. @xmath101 , we find that equations [ eq:<>0 ] and [ eq:<>1 ] imply : @xmath102   \\\\ \\left\\langle w \\right\\rangle_{\\rightarrow 1 } \\geq k_b t \\left [ \\ln(2 ) + \\ln(1-p_s ) \\right ] \\end{array}\\ ] ] notice that the mean work dissipated to realize the procedure is simply : @xmath103 where @xmath6 is the mean on all trajectories . then using the previous inequalities it follows : @xmath104\\ ] ] which is indeed the generalization of the landauer s limit for @xmath105 . in the ideal case </S>",
    "<S> where @xmath106 , all the trajectories end in state 0 at time @xmath37 , and finally : @xmath107 since this result remains approximatively verified for proportions of success close enough to 100% , it explains why in the experiment we find @xmath108 .    to understand the evolution of @xmath82 and @xmath83 , we need to consider the subprocedures @xmath41 and @xmath42 separately . in this case the jarzynski equality does not hold because the initial conditions are not correctly tested ( selecting trajectories by their initial condition introduces a bias in the initial equilibrium distribution ) . but </S>",
    "<S> kawai and coworkers @xcite have shown that for a partition of the phase - space into non - overlapping subsets @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) there is a detailed jarzynski equality : @xmath111 with : @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the phase - space densities of the system measured at the same intermediate but otherwise arbitrary point in time , in the forward and backward protocol , respectively . here , there are only two subsets @xmath115 , defined by the position where the bead starts . by taking @xmath116 the starting point of the procedure , we have @xmath117 , and @xmath118 ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath119 ) identifies with the probability @xmath120 ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath121 ) that the system returns into its initial state , i.e. state 0 ( resp . state 1 ) , under the time - reversed procedure . since @xmath122 it follows from eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : vandenbroeck ] and the definition in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : mm ] that : @xmath123 this result is similar to the one reported in ref . </S>",

    "<S> it should be noticed that here @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> it is reasonable to think that for time - reversed procedures ( that always start in state 0 ) the probability of returning to state 1 is small for fast procedures and increases by increasing the duration @xmath37 , which explains qualitatively the behavior of @xmath83 and @xmath82 observed experimentally . to be more quantitative one has to measure @xmath121 and @xmath120 , but the time - reversed procedure can not be realized experimentally , because it starts with a very fast rising of the force , which can not be reached in our experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , in order to verify eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : timereversed ] , we performed a numerical simulation , where it is possible to realize the corresponding time - reversed procedure and to compute @xmath121 and @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental system can be described by the over - damped langevin equation : @xmath125 where @xmath126 is a gaussian white noise with zero mean and correlation @xmath127 .    </S>",
    "<S> simple numerical simulations were made by integrating this equation with euler method , for a set of procedures as close as possible to the experimental ones . </S>",
    "<S> some results are showed in the following table :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the agreement between @xmath82 ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath83 ) and @xmath121 ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath120 ) is quantitative , and we also retrieve the fact that @xmath84 is always close to @xmath59 for any set of parameters with reasonnable success rate , as in the experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> it was also verified that for proportions of success , if one takes all the trajectories , and not only the ones where the bead ends in the state 0 , the classical jarzynski equality is verified : @xmath89 ( for these specific simulations , @xmath128 and @xmath129 were taken equal to @xmath130 to avoid problems when the bead jumps during this phase of the procedure ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result means that the small fraction of trajectories ( sometimes @xmath131 ) where the bead ends the erasure procedure where it should nt is enough to retrieve the fact that @xmath88 .    as a conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , it has been experimentally shown that for a memory erasure procedure of a one bit system , which is a logically irreversible operation , a detailed jarzynski equality allows us to retrieve the landauer s bound for the work done on the system independently on the speed in which the memory erasure procedure is performed . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we show that the division of the procedure into two sub - procedures is useful in order to link the work done on the system to the probability that the memory returns to its initial state under the time - reversed procedure . </S>",
    "<S> these results are important because they clarify the use of the jarzinsky equality in irreversible operations . </S>"
