    "understanding the coherent manipulation of quantum systems using time - dependent interacting fields is a goal of primary interest in many different areas , including chemical reactivity @xcite , nanotechnology @xcite , and quantum information processing @xcite . to this end , simple analytically solvable two - level systems ( tls )",
    "are often used since they can efficiently describe the dynamics .",
    "one popular choice is the landau - zener model @xcite , in which the driving field is assumed to vary linearly with time .",
    "nonetheless , in many experimental situations sinusoidal , time - periodic control fields are easier to produce and manipulate , and are thus the preferred option . beyond the well - known rabi model ( which accounts for the weak driving case )",
    ", many approaches have been used in the literature to describe various non - trivial limits of this type of systems @xcite . +",
    "a striking phenomenon induced by time - periodic fields is the so - called coherent destruction of tunneling ( cdt ) , first predicted by grossmann _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and then observed experimentally @xcite . a particle in a symmetric double - well potential usually oscillates back and forth , if initially localized in one of the wells",
    "however , if the depth of the wells oscillates in time , the tunneling rate may dramatically change . actually , for certain combinations of the driving parameters , the rate vanishes , resulting in an effective localization of the particle in the initial well . as previously shown @xcite ,",
    "this behavior takes place only when some floquet quasienergies are degenerate .",
    "+ in this work , we show that the floquet spectrum of a tls under a sinusoidal driving in the regime of intermediate frequencies ( @xmath0 , being @xmath1 the driving frequency and @xmath2 the characteristic frequency of the system @xcite ) shows a second kind of `` special points '' , defined by the condition that the quasienergy separation is a local maximum , where : ( i ) population inversion is achieved after a time interval that only depends on the quasienergy difference ; ( ii ) the evolution of the populations happens through a series of well - defined steps of fixed duration , in which the probability remains approximately constant , and ( iii ) the full time - dependent evolution operator @xmath3 can be obtained in a very simple analytical form , which provides a clear physical interpretation of ( ii ) .    finally ,",
    "taking into account the general validity of this two - level model , we study at what extent the results we obtain can be applied to multi - level systems which are periodically driven at an avoided crossings ( ac ) . by designing of a control protocol in a realistic model for the linc@xmath4licn isomerization @xcite",

    "ii we present the model system , enumerate the main results of the well - known high frequency regime and present the basics of the floquet formalism .",
    "we then turn to the intermediate frequency regime , where we show that the dynamics of the system changes considerably , showing a remarkably regular behavior for certain values of the driving field amplitude . in sec .",
    "iii we ellaborate on the analysis and interpretation of these results , and develop a very simple bloch sphere model wich allows us to get an analytical solution for the evolution operator . finally , in sec .",

    "@xcite , and the importance of intermediate states with configurations far from the usual ones discussed .",
    "the linc / licn isomerizing system presents two stable isomers at the linear configurations : li  n  c and li  c  n , which are separated by a relatively modest energy barrier of only 0.0157376 a.u .",
    "the c and n atoms are strongly bounded by a triple covalent bond , while the li is attached to the cn moiety by mostly ionic forces , due to the large charge separation existing between them . for these reasons ,",
    "the cn vibrational mode effectively decouples from the other degrees of freedom of the molecule , and it can be considered frozen at its equilibrium value , @xmath91 . on the other hand ,",
    "the relative position of li with respect to the center of mass of the cn is much more flexible .",
    "in particular the bending along the angular coordinate is very floppy , and the corresponding vibration performs very large amplitude motions even at moderate values of the excitation energy .",

    "a careful analysis of the spectrum shows that most acs in the low - energy region are very narrow and thus correspond to interactions too weak to be useful in the control process .",

    "note that , in such case , the control parameter ( i.e. , @xmath129 in our case ) would reach zones of the energy spectrum where more levels are involved in an effective interaction .",
    "this would invalidate the two - level approximation in a many level system showing multiple acs , like ours .",

    "4 ( b ) of the main text is displayed here .",
    "as can be seen , the ribbon structure typical of the kind of system considered in this work becomes clearly distorted as the frequency increases .",

    "nevertheless , it should be noted that this protocol would require fine tuning of the control parameters , similarly to more elemental strategies ( such as applying a single pi - pulse .",

    "in summary , we have shown the existence of a set of special points in the quasienergy spectrum of a periodically - driven tls , where the evolution of the populations takes place with maximum probability transfer .",
    "these points correspond to the maxima and minima in the typical ribbon structure exhibited by the spectrum , localized between the degeneracies predicted by the occurrence of cdt .",
    "we have also shown that for these particular combinations of the driving parameters the full evolution operator for the system can be well approximated by a very simple analytical expression , which reveals that the system evolves in a bloch sphere following a sequence of rotations around the @xmath86 and @xmath88 axes .",
    "this behavior reflects in the appearance of a series of steps in the time evolution of the populations , whose average takes the form of a decreasing `` ladder '' , a behaviour which has been reported in previous works on this model @xcite it should be noted that these results correspond to the intermediate frequency regime ( @xmath0 ) where the rwa does not apply . finally , we have made use of these conclusions to study the isomerization process induced by an oscillating electric field applied to a triatomic molecule . using this realistic model ,",
    "we have shown that the regime described in this letter is particularly relevant in many level systems showing multiple acs , where the use of large - amplitude driving fields would make the simple two - level approximation invalid .",

    "<S> we study the dynamics of a two - level quantum system under the influence of sinusoidal driving in the intermediate frequency regime . analyzing the floquet quasienergy spectrum , we find combinations of the field parameters for which population transfer is optimal and takes place through a series of well defined steps of fixed duration . </S>",
    "<S> we also show how the corresponding evolution operator can be approximated at all times by a very simple analytical expression . </S>",
    "<S> we propose this model as being specially suitable for treating periodic driving at avoided crossings found in complex multi - level systems , and thus show a relevant application of our results to designing a control protocol in a realistic molecular model . </S>"
