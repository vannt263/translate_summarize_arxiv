    "the _ virtual element method _ ( vem ) , introduced in @xcite , is a recent generalization of the finite element method which is characterized by the capability of dealing with very general polygonal / polyhedral meshes .",
    "the interest in numerical methods that can make use of general polytopal meshes has recently undergone a significant growth in the mathematical and engineering literature ; among the large number of papers on this subject , we cite as a minimal sample @xcite .    indeed",
    ", polytopal meshes can be very useful for a wide range of reasons , including meshing of the domain ( such as cracks ) and data ( such as inclusions ) features , automatic use of hanging nodes , use of moving meshes , adaptivity .",
    "moreover , the vem presents the advantage to easily implement highly regular discrete spaces . indeed , by avoiding the explicit construction of the local basis functions , the vem can easily handle general polygons / polyhedrons without complex integrations on the element ( see @xcite for details on the coding aspects of the method ) . the virtual element method has recently been applied successfully to a wide range of problems , see for instance @xcite .    the numerical approximation of eigenvalue problems for partial differential equations derived from engineering applications , is object of great interest from both , the practical and theoretical points of view .",
    "we refer to @xcite and the references therein for the state of the art in this subject area .",
    "in particular , this paper focus on the so called thin plate vibration problem , which involves the biharmonic operator . among the existing techniques to solve this problem ,",
    "various finite element methods have been introduced and analyzed . in particular , we mention nonconforming methods and different mixed formulations for the kirchhoff model , see for instance @xcite . more recently , in @xcite",
    "a discontinuous galerkin method has been proposed and analyzed for the vibration and buckling problems of thin plates . on the other hand ,",
    "the construction of high regularity conforming finite elements for @xmath1 is difficult in general , since them usually involve a large number of degrees of freedom ( see @xcite ) .",
    "recently , thanks to the flexibility of vem , it has been presented in @xcite that virtual elements can be used to build global discrete spaces of arbitrary regularity that are simple in terms of degrees of freedom and coding aspects ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in the present contribution , we follow a similar approach in order to solve an eigenvalue problem modelling the two - dimensional plate vibration problem considering a conforming @xmath2 discrete formulation .",
    "the aim of this paper is to introduce and analyze a @xmath2-vem which applies to general polygonal meshes , made by possibly non - convex elements , for the two - dimensional plate vibration problem .",
    "we begin with a variational formulation of the spectral problem relying only on the transverse displacement of the plate .",
    "then , we exploit the capability of vem to built highly regular discrete spaces and propose a conforming @xmath1 discrete formulation .",
    "the resulting discrete bilinear form is continuous and elliptic .",
    "this method makes use of a very simple set of degrees of freedom , namely 3 degrees of freedom per vertex of the mesh . by using the abstract spectral approximation theory ( see @xcite ) , under rather mild assumptions on the polygonal meshes , we establish that the resulting scheme provides a correct approximation of the spectrum and prove optimal order error estimates for the eigenfunctions and a double order for the eigenvalues .",
    "we remark that the present method is new on triangular meshes , and in this case the computational cost is almost @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the number of vertices , thus providing a very competitive alternative in comparison to other classical techniques based on finite elements .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows : we introduce in section  [ sec : stat ] the variational formulation of the vibration eigenvalue problem , define a solution operator and establish its spectral characterization .",
    "in section  [ sec : discrete ] , we introduce the virtual element discrete formulation , describe the spectrum of a discrete solution operator and prove some auxiliary results . in section  [ sec : convergence ] , we prove that the numerical scheme provides a correct spectral approximation and establish optimal order error estimates for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions .",
    "several numerical tests that allow us to assess the convergence properties of the method , to confirm that it is not polluted with spurious modes and to check whether the experimental rates of convergence agree with the theoretical ones are reported in section  [ sec : numer ] .",
    "finally , we summarize some conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .    throughout the article",
    "we will use standard notations for sobolev spaces , norms and seminorms .",
    "moreover , we will denote by @xmath5 a generic constant independent of the mesh parameter @xmath6 , which may take different values in different occurrences .    finally , given",
    "a linear bounded operator @xmath7 , defined on a hilbert space @xmath8 , we denote its spectrum by @xmath9 and by @xmath10 the resolvent set of @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , for any @xmath12 , @xmath13 denotes the resolvent operator of @xmath11 corresponding to @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 be a polygonal bounded simply - connected domain occupied by the mean surface of a plate , clamped on its whole boundary @xmath16 .",
    "the plate is assumed to be homogeneous , isotropic , linearly elastic , and sufficiently thin as to be modeled by kirchhoff - love equations .",
    "we denote by @xmath17 the transverse displacement of the mean surface of the plate .",
    "the plate vibration problem reads as follows :    find @xmath18 , @xmath19 , such that @xmath20 where @xmath21 , with @xmath22 being the vibration frequency , and @xmath23 denotes the normal derivative . to simplify the notation we have taken the young modulus and the density of the plate , both equal to @xmath24 .    to obtain a weak formulation of the spectral problem  , we multiply the corresponding equation by @xmath25 and integrate twice by parts in @xmath26 . thus",

    "we note that those are bounded bilinear symmetric forms .",
    "moreover , it is immediate to prove that the eigenvalues of the problem above are real and positive .",
    "next , we define the solution operator associated with the variational eigenvalue problem  : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the solution of the corresponding source problem : @xmath37    the following lemma allows us to establish the well - posedness of this source problem .",
    "[ ha - elipt ] there exists a constant @xmath38 , depending on @xmath26 , such that @xmath39    the result follows immediately from the fact that @xmath40 is a norm on @xmath41 , equivalent with the usual norm .",
    "we deduce from lemma  [ ha - elipt ] that the linear operator @xmath11 is well defined and bounded .",
    "notice that @xmath27 solves problem   ( and hence problem  ) if and only if @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath19 , in which case @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , it is easy to check that @xmath11 is self - adjoint with respect to the @xmath45 inner product . indeed , given @xmath46 , @xmath47",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "the constant @xmath55 in the lemma above is the sobolev regularity for the biharmonic equation with homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "this constant only depends on the domain @xmath26 . if @xmath26 is convex , then @xmath56",
    "otherwise , the lemma holds for all @xmath57 , where @xmath58 depends on the largest reentrant angle of @xmath26 ( see @xcite for the precise equation determining @xmath59 ) .",

    "then , we will introduce a virtual element discretization of the eigenvalue problem   and provide a spectral characterization of the resulting discrete eigenvalue problem .",
