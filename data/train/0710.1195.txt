    "recent advances in nanoscience are expanding the limits of phononic thermal transport , both in the low conductance and high conductance side @xcite .",
    "the highest thermal conductance of a particular material is achieved , when the phonons do not scatter at all ; this is the ballistic transport limit . at room temperature",
    "the ballistic limit is quite hard to achieve , but at low temperatures ( a few k and below ) phonon - phonon and phonon - impurity scattering become so weak that ballistic transport can be observed @xcite , and the emitted power has the typical stefan - boltzmann form @xcite @xmath1 summing over the different phonon modes with speeds of sound @xmath2 and radiator emissivities @xmath3 .",
    "in addition to bulk samples , ballistic phonon transport was also observed for thin amorphous sin@xmath4 membranes recently @xcite . at low temperatures ,",
    "the dominant thermal phonon wavelength becomes comparable to the membrane thickness ( for a 1 m @xmath5 membrane this happens at @xmath6100mk ) leading to an effectively 2d phonon gas .",
    "we have recently considered ballistic and diffusive thermal conduction in thin membranes @xcite , spanning the transition from the 3d to the fully 2d limit , using the correct low - frequency modes known from elasticity theory ( lamb modes ) . here",
    "we explicitly discuss the dependence of ballistic thermal conduction on materials parameters .",
    "the simple question we would like to answer is : what kind of material is the best ( worst ) ballistic thermal conductor for any thickness of the membrane , and can we even define a material - only dependent thermal conductivity that does not depend on the sample dimensions ?    for the more typical cases where phonon transport is not ballistic , but limited by different scattering mechanisms in the sample , it is possible to define a material dependent local thermal conductivity @xmath7 , which depends on the specific heat @xmath8 , average speed of sound @xmath9 and phonon mean free path @xmath10 as @xmath11 . for 3d crystals",
    ", @xmath8 is proportional to @xmath12 , but because @xmath10 scales as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 for phonon - electron , impurity , and phonon - phonon scattering , respectively , @xmath7 always grows with higher speed of sound @xcite .",
    "this is the intuitive result that high speed of sound materials are better thermal conductors ( like diamond ) .",
    "however , for the case of ballistic conduction this is not true anymore .",
    "the thermal conductance @xmath0 ( one can not define a local @xmath7 anymore ) is calculated from the total power @xmath15 that is radiated from an object as @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath0 actually has a dependence @xmath17 , as can be seen from the stefan - boltzmann law , eq .",
    "( [ eqn_stefan_boltzmann_law ] ) .",
    "the material with the _ lowest _ speed of sound is the best thermal conductor ! in the following we will investigate what is the situation for thin membranes .",
    "in isotropic 3d bulk systems there are three independent phonon modes , two transversally and one longitudinally polarized , with sound velocities @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . in the presence of boundaries , the bulk phonon modes couple to each other and",
    "form a new set of eigenmodes , which in the case of a free standing membrane are horizontal shear modes ( @xmath20 ) and symmetric ( @xmath21 ) and antisymmetric ( @xmath22 ) lamb modes @xcite .",
    "the frequency @xmath23 for the @xmath20 modes is simply @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the wave vector component parallel to membrane surfaces , @xmath26 is the membrane thickness and the integer @xmath27 is the branch number .",
    "the dispersion relations of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 modes can not be given in a closed form , but have to be calculated numerically @xcite .",
    "the lowest three branches , dominant for thin membranes at low temperatures , have the low frequency expressions @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with the effective sound velocity @xmath31 of the @xmath21 mode and the effective mass @xmath32^{-1}$ ] of the @xmath22 mode `` particle '' @xcite .",
    "this lowest @xmath22 mode has a quadratic dispersion instead of the usual phonon - like linear one , and is mostly responsible for the non - trivial behavior of thin membranes at low temperatures .",
    "figure [ fig_fig1 ] shows a schematic of the system in consideration . a thin metal film of perimeter @xmath33 heats the membrane directly below @xcite . to simplify the discussion , we assume that the hot phonons from the heater have a thermal distribution and are radiated from its perimeter into the membrane , similar to black body radiation .",
    "we further assume that no radiation is backscattered . with these assumptions",
    "the total heat flow out of the detector is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the bose - einstein distribution and @xmath36 and @xmath27 are the mode and branch indices @xcite .",
    "if enough branches are used , the 3d to 2d transition can be computed from this expression .",
    "if the membrane is thin and temperature low ( @xmath37 ) , only the lowest branch of each mode is occupied ( @xmath27=0 ) , and we are fully in the 2d limit , in which case we get from eq .",
    "( [ eqn_p_of_t ] ) @xmath38\\,.\\label{eqn_p_2d}\\ ] ] note that the effective mass of the lowest @xmath22 mode depends on the membrane thickness and hence in the 2d limit @xmath39 . in the 3d limit @xmath40 ,",
    "the dominant phonon wavelength is much smaller than @xmath26 , leading to decoupling of the longitudinal and transversal modes and @xmath41 as expected , @xmath42 .",
    "this means that at a fixed temperature the radiated power will first decrease with decreasing @xmath26 , then reach a global minimum and will increase again , if we decrease @xmath26 further .",
    "the minimum is approximately at the 2d-3d crossover thickness @xmath43 .",

    "[ fig_fig2 ] ( a ) shows the computed @xmath0 for @xmath46=100 mk and @xmath33=1.6 m as a function of the membrane thickness @xmath26 for four different materials : pb ( @xmath47 m / s , @xmath48 m / s ) , al ( @xmath49 m / s , @xmath50 m / s ) , sin ( @xmath51 m / s , @xmath52 m / s ) , and poly - diamond ( @xmath53 m / s , @xmath54 m / s ) .",
    "the values of @xmath9 are calculated values for the isotropic case , based on measured single crystal elastic constants @xcite .",
    "all materials have a physically relevant critical thickness , ranging from @xmath55 nm for pb to @xmath56 nm in diamond , below which @xmath0 increases with decreasing thickness .",
    "the material with highest @xmath0 is pb , as it has the lowest speeds of sound , and diamond is the poorest conductor . in the 2d limit , where @xmath57 , the differences between the materials are not as strong as in the 3d limit .",
    "one could say that all materials start to resemble each other in the ultrathin range @xmath58 nm .",
    "on the other hand , in the 3d limit , @xmath0 increases linearly with @xmath26 , the common sense result .",
    "therefore , we could try to define a materials parameter @xmath44 , the conductance per unit emission area , for all thicknesses .",
    "this is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_fig2 ] ( b ) .",
    "as we see , in the 3d limit @xmath44 is not a function of @xmath26 , and is truly a materials parameter .",
    "however , when the membrane becomes thinner , @xmath44 starts increasing strongly .",
    "this means that thin membranes are actually more effective thermal conductors , per unit emission area .",
    "this increase in ballistic `` conductivity '' is striking : for diamond it can be four orders of magnitude from @xmath59 m to @xmath60 nm .",
    "therefore , a way of increasing the ballistic thermal conductance in a given volume would be to use a structure composed of many parallel thin membranes of a material with low speed of sound .",

    "[ fig_fig3 ] for @xmath64 nm . in the 3d limit , @xmath0 is naturally proportional to @xmath65 . in the 2d limit however , the power of the temperature dependence does not just drop by one , but instead we have @xmath66 , and the crossover temperature is between 50 .. 400 mk for @xmath64 nm . to give a better picture of how the power of the temperature dependence of @xmath0 changes with temperature",

    "for a given temperature , ballistic thermal conduction is maximized by choosing a material with low speed of sound , and by using several parallel thin membranes , instead of a bulk slab of the same total thickness . a bulk slab of diamond of thickness 30 @xmath68 m has the same conductance as a 2 nm thick lead membrane .",
