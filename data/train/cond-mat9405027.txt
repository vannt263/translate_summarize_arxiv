    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition @xcite has been proposed as a possible mechanism for high-@xmath1 superconductivity .",
    "anisotropically josephson coupled 3d xy model served as a microscopic model for layered superconductors with weak interlayer coupling .",
    "@xcite in the anisotropic 3d xy model with infinite volume , hikami and tsuneto ( ht ) have proposed two types of excitations , _",
    "i.e. _ , independent vortex pairs in each layer and closed vortex rings.@xcite this view is also supported by korshunov s theory @xcite based on the 3d josephson junction array .",

    "2d kt transitions in monolayered or thin - film ybco have also been observed.@xcite in bulk samples , superconducting transition have been considered to occur owing to kt transitions by independent vortex in each cuo@xmath3 layer despite the presence of interlayer coupling.@xcite    in this paper , we will show by using thin films that excitations of vortex string threading the film do emerge as a result of interlayer interaction .",
    "extending ht theory to thin - film cases , we are naturally led to the concept of pairs of vortex string and antivortex string threading the film .",
    "this concept has been introduced and demonstrated experimentally by matsuda _",
    "_ using ybco thin films prepared by reactive evaporation technique.@xcite they observed the increase in superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 as a function of the number of unit - cell layers and argued that this increase in @xmath1 is due to vortex string and antivortex string .",
    "however , they did not consider the existence of independent vortex and antivortex pairs in their renormalization - group ( rg ) analysis .",
    "this is not always justified .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that kt transition by vortex string occurs in bscco thin films even when we consider the coexistence of vortex - string and antivortex - string pairs and independent vortex and antivortex pairs .",
    "it is generally thought that bscco is more anisotropic than ybco .",
    "then , the role of independent vortex and antivortex pairs seems more important in bscco than in ybco even if we consider the kt transition by vortex string .",
    "consequently , a more rigorous treatment considering the coexistence of both excitations seems necessary .",
    "thus , to elucidate the role of interlayer interaction , we study the superconducting properties of bscco thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) and obtain the results to be interpreted by kt transition by vortex string .",
    "we observe the universal jump in the temperature dependence of nonlinear power law @xmath12 obtained from current - voltage ( @xmath0 ) characteristics and the increase in @xmath1 as a function of the number of half - unit - cell layers @xmath2 for our bscco thin films .",
    "the increase in @xmath1 as a function of @xmath2 is rather similar to that of ybco thin films and can be regarded as the evidence of the presence of vortex strings threading the film .",
    "this is in contradiction to the expectation that for very anisotropic bscco film the interlayer coupling is so weak that independent vortices may be dominant excitations .",
    "we further confirm that the universal jump in @xmath13-@xmath14 relation occurs in the vortex - string form and obtain the size of pairs of vortex string and antivortex string .",
    "this is analyzed on the basis of the kt rg flow with interlayer coupling . to consider the strong anisotropy of bscco superconductors , we formulate 2d kt theory for multilayered thin film coupled by interlayer josephson coupling .",
    "this theory includes three types of low - lying excitations , _",
    "i.e. _ , independent vortex and antivortex pairs in each layer , vortex - string and antivortex - string pairs threading the film , and closed vortex rings as proposed by hikami and tsuneto.@xcite comparing the free energies of these three types of excitations , we find that the lowest free - energy excitation changes its form from the independent vortex into the vortex string as a function of @xmath5 , the separation between independent vortex ( or vortex - string ) and antivortex ( or antivortex - string ) pair .",
    "we consider the two regions separated by a characteristic length @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath6 will be defined later in eq .",
    "( [ rn ] ) .",
    "then , the lowest free - energy excitations are independent vortex and antivortex pairs with distance @xmath15 , and are vortex - string and antivortex - string pairs threading the film for @xmath7 .",
    "thus , we write kt rg equations with respect to the independent vortex pairs with @xmath8 intralayer and @xmath16-dependent interlayer interaction for @xmath15 and then with respect to vortex - string pairs with @xmath8 interstring interaction for @xmath15 .",
    "differential equations of these two regions are connected by the continuities of superconducting carrier density and the vortex density per area . in this way",
    ", we have reduced the 3d xy problem to the 2d xy problem with interlayer coupling . solving the 2d kt rg equations in bscco thin - film case , we obtain rg flow in which interlayer coupling is considered .",
    "we observe the transition from independent vortex to vortex string in rg flow at any temperatures .",
    "we shall see that kt transitions occur in the vortex string region in these rg flows thus obtained .",
    "considering the asymptotic behavior of the free energy of a vortex pair we show that the @xmath16 dependent interlayer coupling necessarily leads to the kt transition in the form of vortex string threading the film . analyzing the experimental results on both @xmath0 and @xmath1-@xmath2 relations consistently ,",
    "we conclude that the interlayer coupling plays a significant role even in the very anisotropic bscco so that the kt transition occurs in the vortex - string excitation .",
    "considering the coexistence of the independent vortex , we show that the kt transition by vortex string occurs in films as thick as 20 half - unit - cell layer for the strongly anisotropic superconductors bscco . comparing the results of rg flow with @xmath13-@xmath14 relation",
    "we can determine the size of pairs of vortex string and antivortex string during the kt transition .",
    "thus , we believe that our experimental and theoretical method of analysis using thin films will pave the way to a quantitative understanding of the interlayer coupling in superconductors such as bscco , ybco , _ etc_. this will be a step forward to revealing the nature of superconductivity in these materials .",

    "5 is similar to that of ybco in a sense that @xmath216 is of the same order of @xmath57 itself .",
    "this means that the interplane interaction is equally important as the intraplane kt interaction .",
    "the difference lies in the shape of @xmath138 vs @xmath2 relation .",
    "this difference arises from the difference in @xmath2 dependence of @xmath217 , which in turn originates from the difference in the anisotropy ratio @xmath31 , as is indicated in eq .",
    "( [ tc ] ) . for smaller anisotropy parameters , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath2181 , @xmath49 gets smaller , and intervortex interactions are screened largely by vortex string pairs . in this case ,",
    "@xmath138 approaches that of 2d kt theory with respect to vortex string .",
    "_ s model corresponds to the case of the limit @xmath49=0 in our model .",
    "in contrast , for larger anisotropy ratio @xmath2191 , @xmath49 gets larger and intervortex interactions are screened by independent vortex pairs with @xmath15 and by vortex - string pairs with @xmath7 . in this case , @xmath138 approaches less rapidly that of 2d kt model with respect to vortex string .",
    "this is the case for bscco and to solve the rg equation is inevitable to obtain @xmath138 vs @xmath2 relation .",
    "now , within the framework of our model , we discuss the absence of dissociation for independent vortex and antivortex pairs . in our model ,",
    "kt transition occurrs in vortex - string region .",
    "this is due to the absence of @xmath16 term as is indicated in eq .",
    "( [ ust ] ) in this region .",
    "this can be understood by the following reasoning .",
    "if we have the interlayer coupling term in the form of @xmath220 , the free energy of the system with an isolated independent vortex is given by @xmath221 .",
    "the last term is the entropy term and @xmath222 is the sample size along the @xmath20 plane . in the limit @xmath223",
    ", we have @xmath224 , irrespective of @xmath14 .",
    "this means the absence of vortex dissociation .",
    "this is also suggested by the rg flow in fig .  1 .",
    "the rg curves seem to continue to fall off at large @xmath100 region if transitions to vortex string were absent .",
    "thus , in general , we have bound state for infinite sample as far as interlayer coupling is a more steeply rising function of @xmath5 than @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the low - lying excitation should necessarily be other than independent vortex pairs in infinite area thin films , _",
    "i.e. _ , vortex - string and antivortex - string pairs in thin films .    in the case of finite and very anisotropic samples with limited area along the @xmath20 plane",
    ", however , kt transition by independent vortex and antivortex pairs may occur . equating the first and the second term of eq .",
    "( [ uvp ] ) , we have @xmath225.@xcite for @xmath226 , the first @xmath8 term is larger than the second @xmath16 term . the length @xmath227 becomes large as the anisotropy ratio @xmath31 becomes large .",
    "if the sample size along the @xmath20 plane is less than @xmath227 , @xmath16-dependent coupling term is negligible as compared with @xmath8 term within the @xmath5 range of the sample size and 2d kt transition can occur . in this case",
    ", however , @xmath215 will be independent of @xmath2 but depend on sample size along the @xmath20 plane when this size is near @xmath227 .",
    "we believe that this case is irrelevant for our very thin films of bscco , since @xmath215 increases as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "finally , we will make some comments on the significance of our consequence described so far in bulk high-@xmath1 superconductors . following matsuda _",
    "et  al . _",
    ", we assign the superconducting transition temperature of bulk bscco crystal to 2d/3d crossover temperature @xmath228 .",
    "this is defined by hikami and tsuneto as the temperature , at which @xmath229 diverges and given by @xcite @xmath230 in rg flows such as in fig .  1",
    ", the position of @xmath231 where the rg flow starts to fall off goes to infinity at @xmath232 . in our rg flows of fig .",
    "1 with temperatures around @xmath138 these deflecting points are located within finite regions .",
    "this means that the calculated superconducting transition temperatures @xmath59 are less than @xmath228 .",
    "these results are consistent with our view that the @xmath1 of our thin film is due to vortex string and that of bulk is 2d/3d crossover .",
    "if we insert @xmath23370 k and @xmath127=30 k , we have @xmath2341.3 .",
    "as far as we understand , we should use the renormalized @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ tast ] ) as we have obtained @xmath49 by solving rg equations .",
    "for example , at @xmath14=70 k , we have @xmath227=28 nm , @xmath235=160 , and the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ tast ] ) reduces to 1.5 .",
    "a small discrepancy may be due to the renormalization of @xmath21 in the bulk .    on experimental side",
    ", we have grown very thin films by mbe and verified vortex - string excitations therein .",
    "we have used untwinned films exhibiting sharp superconducting transitions as described in sec .",
    "however , more systematic experiment determining the physical parameters of thin films are needed to quantify the model . in particular , superlattices with superconducting layers sandwiched by nonsuperconducting layers are very interesting to study the role of interlayer coupling .",
    "the measurement of @xmath215 vs @xmath2 relation on other high-@xmath1 thin films such as la@xmath236sr@xmath237cuo@xmath238 and tbcco is important for the firm establishment of the concept of vortex string .",
    "so far , we have interpreted our experimental results on superconducting properties of bscco thin film in terms of kt transition by vortex string . in this view , the influence of pinning centers such as defects can be observed as a perturbation to the kt transition .",
    "the main reasons that we interpret our experiment by kt transition are following .",
    "( 1 ) there is a broad transition region in superconducting transition .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath1 is far lower than @xmath17 .",
    "( 2 ) universal jump from 3 to 1 is observed in @xmath13-@xmath14 relation .",
    "( 3 ) the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath1 is observed in films of various numbers of layers .",
    "the @xmath1-@xmath2 relation is the experimental evidence of vortex string .",
    "in addition , it is believed that the pinning effects are weak in bscco superconductors @xcite and that our bscco film grown on nd : yalo@xmath9 ( 001 ) substrates are untwinned as was described in sec .",
    "3 . if the transport properties of vortices are not dominated by vortex - antivortex interaction but by vortex - defect interaction , these behaviors characteristic of kt transition will not be observed .",
    "for example , in the presence of high - density defects , the universal jump will be obscured.@xcite we showed by our rg scheme that to include @xmath16 dependent interaction necessarily leads to the kt transition by vortex string . comparing the solution of rg equation with the experimental results of @xmath13-@xmath14 relation , we obtained @xmath100=4 , the logarithm of the size of interacting pairs in the unit of @xmath23 as was described in sec .",
    "4 . in our view",
    ", the finite size of independent vortex and antivortex pair or vortex - string and antivortex - string pair represents the distance in which independent vortex and antivortex or vortex - string and antivortex - string can migrate without being influenced by the defects . from the @xmath13-@xmath14 relation for samples with @xmath2=3 , we have @xmath2392.5 , shorter than @xmath100=4 for @xmath2=20 .",
    "this means that the mean free pass for vortex transport becomes shorter as the film becomes thinner and @xmath215 , lower . in this case , pinning effects are stronger and vortices are more firmly pinned .",
    "this tendency seems physically reasonable , since activation energies for vortices to be freed from pinning are lowered at higher temperatures .",
    "note that the value @xmath2392.5 is rather close to @xmath49=2.34 , which suggests that pinning effect near @xmath215 is fairly strong in the films @xmath2=3 . in this way within the framework of our view , the effects of the pinning can be considered as a perturbation to the kt transition by vortex string and assessed consistently in terms of finite length of @xmath100 .",
    "thus , we believe that our view for our experimental results is basically correct .    in conclusion , we have formulated the kt theory with interlayer coupling to quantify the concept of vortex string .",
    "we write down the kt rg equations on independent vortex pairs for @xmath15 and on vortex - string pairs for @xmath7 and then set up the scheme connecting the two regions .",
    "kt transition occurred in the vortex - string region with @xmath8 interstring interaction . we believe that the fundamental assumptions in our model are basically correct since @xmath0 characteristics and the @xmath138 vs @xmath2 relation in our bscco films were interpreted by vortex string .",
    "significance of these results was discussed in brief in relation to bulk high-@xmath1 superconductors .",
