    "in order to study the effects of the tensor and spin orbit interactions in nuclei we use a simple interaction    v = v@xmath5 + x v@xmath6 + y v@xmath7    where c @xmath8 central , s.o . @xmath8 spin - orbit and t @xmath8 tensor . for x=1 , y=1 we select v so as to be close to a realistic g matrix like bonn a. we can turn the spin orbit interaction off ( on ) by setting x=0 ( x=1 ) .",
    "likewise we can turn the tensor interaction off ( on ) by setting y=0(1 ) .",
    "this allows us to study behaviors as a function of x and/or of y.    this interaction  @xcite is a modification and correction of a previous interaction  @xcite .",
    "this change does not affect calculations purely in the p shell but there are some changes when core excitations are included .",
    "to avoid confusion we call the current interaction v(2005 ) and the previous one v(1991),i.e after the year of publication .",
    "the details and reasons for the changes are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our main thesis will be that the tensor interaction given by a bare g matrix is too strong in the isospin t=0 channel .",
    "by simply making it weaker we can correlate a lot of data and be rid of a lot of anomalies .",
    "we conclude by presenting simple arguments by gerry brown to justify using a weaker tensor interaction in the valence space .",
    "care must be taken in that alternate explanations could give the same result as a weaker tensor interaction e.g. a stronger spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the topics we discuss are :    1 .   the quadrupole moment of the j=1@xmath9 state of @xmath0li .",
    "2 .   the t=1  t=0 energy splitting of 0@xmath1 states in @xmath20 .",
    "the near vanishing of the gamow - teller matrix element for a=14 @xmath3o(j=0 t=1 ) @xmath10",
    "@xmath3n(j=1 t=0 ) .",
    "4 .   the effect of the tensor interaction on single particle energies in open shell nuclei - @xmath4c and @xmath3n .    some of these results have been discussed in previously  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "the nucleus @xmath0li is often described in cluster models as a deuteron plus an alpha particle . however , the quadrupole moment of the deuteron is positive @xmath12 e @xmath13 whereas that of @xmath0li is negative , @xmath14 e @xmath13 .    that the deuteron has a quadrupole moment leads to it having a j=1@xmath11 ground state and hence the isospin must be t=0 . without a tensor interaction the quadrupole moment of the deuteron",
    "would be zero .",
    ".static quadrupole moments e @xmath13 for various model spaces and tensor interaction strengths ( y ) using the bare electric charges @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "all calculations are done with the full spin - orbit strength x=1 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]            the second order contribution to the central interaction is negative definite and for the tensor it is positive definite .",
    "hence whether there is destructive or constructive interference depends on the sign of the first order term as given above .",
    "we start from a moszkowski - scott cutoff radius of 1 fermi corresponding to x of 0.7 .",
    "they argued that the part of the attraction up to the cut - off radius of 1 fermi cancels out the short - range repulsion whose range is about 0.4 fermi .",
    "@xcite        the first order central even is negative so adding the second order tensor contributions makes it more negative .",
    "this is reasonable from the existence of the t=0 even channel bound state for two nucleons , namely the deuteron .",
    "the bare central interaction in this channel is not deep enough to support a bound state so the tensor interaction has to contribute .",
    "we can see this in figure [ fig : vce ]    the first order tensor even interaction is negative ( when the -3 factor is included ) so the combination of first and second order terms must be less negative or weaker .",
    "the sign of the first order tensor interaction is determined phenomenologically by the positive sign of the quadrupole moment of the deuteron .",
    "also the sign is consistent with the one pion exchange potential .",
    "this supports all the conclusions of the previous sections where we see repeatedly that the bare g matrix tensor interaction is too strong in the t=0 channel and needs weakening .    for the odd channels we have first in figure [ fig : vco ] the central odd potential . here",
    "the attractive contribution of the second order term pulls an initially repulsive first order term down sufficiently so that it is slightly attractive . for the tensor odd interaction in [ fig : vto ] ,",
    "the inclusion of the second order term again makes the total tensor portion less attractive .",
    "we emphasize that the main point of this work is to show that there are clear experimental signatures that require that in the spin triplet channel renormalization relative to a bare g matrix are required .",
    "this is especially true for even l states where not only is the effective central part of the interaction made deeper but also the effective tensor interaction is weakened ( screening effects ) .",
    "relative to the use of only a first order tensor interaction , the combined first and second order tensor interaction helps to explain the the smaller energy splitting of t=1 and t=0 0@xmath23 states in @xmath2o and the vanishing of the gamow - teller matrix element in the @xmath3c beta decay .",
    "also the anti - spin orbit effects in open shell nuclei like @xmath4c are reduced although they are still substantial .",
    "we still have a problem with @xmath0li .",
    "although we have shown that one needs the tensor interaction to get a negative quadrupole moment we get it to be increasingly negative with increasing model space .",
    "in closing we note that the shell model works very well in the p shell as noted by the many works of cohen and kurath  @xcite .",
    "one purpose here is to understand why it works so well .",
    "we see that although the explicit configurations involving higher shells are not present in most calculations , their implicit presence is of crucial importance for the success of the model .",
    "we have adopted a low - tech approach to illustrate this point .",
    "for more trustworthy quantitative results , the high powered ab initio shell model methods or other equivalent methods need to be employed .",
    "nevertheless we feel that the more qualitative methods used here are of considerable value in providing insight into the physics behind these more complex approaches ."
