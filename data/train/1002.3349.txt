    "the interest in measuring the , presently unknown , absolute mass scale of neutrinos has been renewed by the experimental evidences of neutrino oscillation @xcite .",
    "it is known since long @xcite that neutrinos from supernova can contribute valuable information on the mass of neutrinos .",
    "in fact , the stringent limit of @xmath0 ev at 95 % cl has been obtained by loredo and lamb @xcite using sn1987a neutrinos @xcite ; another important result in this connection is the one obtained by nardi and zuluaga , who argue that future supernova will permit us to probe the sub - ev region @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we aim at updating both these results : namely , we improve the bound on neutrinos from sn1987a and we evaluate the ultimate sensitivity of the method to probe neutrino masses introduced by zatsepin .",
    "the limit from sn1987a @xcite is quoted in the pdg report but it is considered _ `` no longer comparable with the limits from tritium beta decay '' _ @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the 3 neutrino context it can be compared with the limit obtained in laboratory @xcite ; the value of the latter is @xmath1 ev , about three times tighter than the former . nevertheless , the analysis on neutrino mass of lamb and loredo @xcite maintains a big methodological merit , being the only one based on a theoretically motivated model for the emission of neutrinos .",
    "their model is capable of reproducing the expected ( main ) features of neutrino emission and , in particular , it includes an initial phase of intense luminosity .",
    "this phase , called accretion , is the crucial ingredient for theories that attempt to explain the explosion of the star , based on the `` delayed scenario '' @xcite  see @xcite for a review . as we will show in the following ,",
    "this phase is the theoretical ingredient that allowed to obtain the comparably strong limit on the mass recalled previously .",
    "there are two specific considerations that make a reanalysis necessary : 1 )  it has been noted that the likelihood function adopted by lamb and loredo has a statistical bias @xcite ; 2 )  in addition , an improved model for the emission of neutrinos ( which overcomes certain shortcomings and involves significant changes in the astrophysical parameters resulting from sn1987a data analysis ) has been recently introduced in the scientific literature @xcite .",
    "the method used in this paper to investigate the neutrino mass is based on punctual comparison between the features of the collected data @xcite and the expectations resulting from a specific theoretical model  @xcite .",
    "this model describes the expected flux of electron antineutrinos , taking into account that the main reaction leading to observable events is @xmath2 both in water cherenkov than in scintillator detectors .",
    "we assume that the shape of the flux is known up to nine free parameters that are obtained fitting the data .",
    "let us explain their meaning : the first six parameters belong to two emission phases ( accretion and cooling ) and are used to take into account the large astrophysical uncertainties .",
    "each emission phase is characterized by its intensity , its duration and the average energy of the emitted neutrinos .",
    "the three parameters of the accretion phase are the initial mass ( @xmath3 ) , the time scale ( @xmath4 ) and the initial temperature ( @xmath5 ) ; those of the cooling phase are the radius ( @xmath6 ) , the time scale ( @xmath7 ) and the initial temperature ( @xmath8 ) . for details and analytical expressions",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the other three parameters are called `` offset times '' ; each one of them is the absolute delay of the first observed event in each detector , more explicitly described below . we need to include three different offset times because the clocks of kamiokande - ii , imb and baksan were not synchronized @xcite .",
    "now we include the effects of neutrino mass . the antineutrino flux , @xmath9 , is a parametric function that depends on the time of emission ( @xmath10 ) and on the energy of the antineutrino ( @xmath11 ) , see in particular eqs .  10 , 13 , 19 and 20 in reference @xcite .",
    "of course this function must vanish for @xmath12 . using the same notation of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see in particular eq .  8 there ) we can write the emission time for the @xmath13-th event as follow : @xmath14 the first term in the right hand side , @xmath15 , is the relative time between the @xmath13-th and the first observed event in the considered detector , which is known directly from the data without significant error .",
    "the second one , @xmath16 , is the offset time parameter which is the sum of the emission time of the first neutrino detected , @xmath17 , and of its delay due to the velocity of propagation , @xmath18 , namely @xmath19 .",
    "finally , the last term , @xmath20 is the delay of the neutrino due to a non - zero mass @xcite , where @xmath21 is the distance of propagation .",
    "the neutrino energy @xmath22 of the @xmath13-th event can be reconstructed from the measured energy of the positron , @xmath23 , which is known up to its error , @xmath24 .",
    "the numerical value of the delay when @xmath25 ( as for sn1987a ) , @xmath26 ( a typical value ) and @xmath27 is @xmath28 s , which is five times longer than the duration of the phase of accretion .",
    "the scope of the statistical analysis is to extract from the fit @xmath16 and @xmath29 at the same time .",
    "it is quite evident that these two terms work in opposite sense , see eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and recall the condition @xmath30 .",
    "this makes the extraction of these two parameters more difficult , especially in the case of sn1987a , when the number of observed events is small .",
    "we adopt the same likelihood function @xmath31 constructed in @xcite including in it the expression for the times @xmath32 given in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "this is a function of 10 parameters , namely the nine parameters previously discussed plus the neutrino mass .",
    "obtained by analyzing supernova neutrino data as a function of the neutrino mass .",
    "the two continuous curves are obtained from sn1987a data ; the thick one includes the astrophysical uncertainties , the thin one assumes instead that the astrophysical parameters of neutrino emission are known . for comparison ,",
    "we include the result of the analysis of simulated data set , collected in a detector a la super - kamiokande ( sk ) , for a future supernova exploding at 10 kpc from us ( leftmost dashed curve ) .",
    "this curve , discussed in detail later , illustrates the ultimate sensitivity of the method .",
    "_ , width=283 ]      using the definition @xmath33 we obtain the function that allows us to estimate the neutrino mass @xmath34 this function is plotted in fig .",
    "the two continuous curves show the results of sn1987a data analysis .",
    "the thick line is obtained , for any fixed value of the neutrino mass , maximizing the likelihood with respect to the other 9 free parameters .",
    "the curve is somewhat bumpy , reflecting the presence of multiple maxima that compete in the likelihood with similar height .",
    "the existence of these maxima has been already remarked in @xcite and causes numerical difficulties . to avoid these problems we bound the mass of accreting material @xmath3 , which regulates the intensity of neutrinos emission in the accretion phase , to be lower than 0.6 @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the thin line , instead , arises when the 6 astrophysical parameters are set to the best - fit values obtained in @xcite . in this case only the 3 offset times are allowed to fluctuate freely to maximize the likelihood .",
    "the comparison of the two curves reveals some interesting features :    * in spite of the really different assumptions , namely the complete knowledge of the supernova @xmath36 emitted flux or only of its shape ( up to 6 parameters ) , the two curves are quite similar .",
    "this shows that the large uncertainties in the astrophysics of the emission _ are not _ the main limitation in this type of analysis . * in both curves , the minimum is located at @xmath37 , however , this is not statistically significant . rather than @xmath38which is the quantity that is actually probed ,",
    "( [ 1])emphasizes somewhat artificially the region close to @xmath39 .",
    "] this is linked to a clustering of the events # 1,2,4,6 of kamiokande - ii for @xmath40",
    "ev , already remarked by several authors , e.g. , @xcite .    from our statistical analysis ,",
    "we obtain as limit on neutrino mass from sn1987a data the value @xmath41 as already noted , this does not change much if we assume that the astrophysics of the emission is perfectly known ; in this case , in fact , the limit becomes @xmath42 : see fig .",
    "[ f ] . from eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ del ] ) and from the previous discussion , it is quite evident that the information on the presence of the neutrino mass is mainly contained in the earlier events and , in particular , in those with low energy .",
    "these considerations select , as the most relevant data , the six events collected by kamiokande - ii in the first second  @xcite , that incidentally , are also the most relevant ones to determine the presence of an accretion phase  @xcite .",
    "these findings led us to the question of evaluating the ultimate sensitivity of this method for a future galactic supernova event .",
    "for this aim , we will analyze in this section simulated data , extracted from the generator described in @xcite upgraded to describe the propagation of massive neutrinos , focussing mostly on the possibilities of the existing detectors .",
    "we will introduce and critically examine the assumptions used to derive the bound , comment on their statistical meaning , and overview the prospects offered by future detectors .",
    "the expected counting rate of the signal is a function of the emission time @xmath10 , neutrino energy @xmath11 , detector mass @xmath43 , distance of the supernova @xmath21 and of the astrophysical parameters that describe the electron antineutrino emission , namely @xmath44 that depends on the supernova distance through the electron antineutrino flux , i.e. , @xmath45 .",
    "we will consider a sn exploding at a distance of @xmath46 kpc , typical of a galactic event @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath47 is the cross section of the interaction process  @xcite ; the function @xmath48 is the detector efficiency that we set to @xmath49 above a threshold of 6.5 mev ; we approximate @xmath50 with @xmath51  mev .",

    "thus , in our analysis this function depends on 7 astrophysical parameters .",
    "each event extracted from this function is characterized by its relative detection time @xmath15 , its positron energy , @xmath23 , and the error on this energy given by the function @xmath54 @xcite .",

    "we also considered two different detector masses : @xmath57 , with an average number of events of @xmath58 , similar to the ones expected on lvd detector , and also @xmath59 , corresponding to an average number of @xmath60 expected events , which resembles the statistics collected for sn1987a .",
    "we calculate the bound on the mass by assuming that :    * the astrophysical parameters are precisely known ; we use those in ref .",

    "these are very optimistic assumptions as appropriate to evaluate the ultimate sensitivity of the method .",
    "we discuss the weight of these assumptions in the following and their implications on the understanding of sn1987a results .",

    "( [ 1 ] ) ) , which implies the condition on the neutrino mass : @xmath89 when we replace @xmath90 , namely , neglecting the error in the measurement of the positron energy , we obtain the bound @xmath91 on the neutrino mass directly from the data . typically , the minimum in eq .",

    "we evaluated the ultimate sensitivity of the method with the existing neutrino detectors , assuming that the offset time was known without significant error .",

    "in principle , we could profit of the detection of gravity waves , assuming they will be seen .",
    "however , two additional conditions should be fulfilled : a precise location of the supernova in the sky is needed ; the interval of time between the onsets of gravitational and neutrino emissions should be known .",

    "for example , with an increase of the number of events expected in super - kamiokande ( @xmath109 kton fiducial volume ) by a factor of @xmath110 one could expect an improvement on @xmath38 as the inverse of the square root of this number , thus reaching @xmath111 ev in the most optimistic case . if instead we use the stabler bound of eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) , we find again a value close to the one in eq .",

    "an alternative possibility would be to identify the very short burst from early neutronization ; see @xcite for an earlier discussion .",
    "its detection could permit us to investigate neutrino masses of similar size . in the standard scenario of neutrino emission",
    ", however , this burst leads to a very small fraction of the total number of events , which leads us again to consider a megaton water cherenkov detector .",
    "in fact , the elastic scattering events are 1/35 of the total sample ; the burst comprises some 1/20 of the total energy released in @xmath112 s , which , when converted in @xmath113 s by oscillations , have a cross section 6.5 times smaller .",
    "thus , a conservative estimation of the event fraction from the neutronization burst is 1/4500 , which means about @xmath11420 ( = 1 ) events in 450 ( 22.5 ) kton of fiducial volume from a supernova at nominal distance of 10  kpc . if used in eq .",

    "( [ eq8 ] ) , but possibly more stable and without resorting to the gravity wave trigger . does not allow to reconstruct the neutrino energy precisely . ]",
    "the present work , part of a series of papers on supernova neutrinos @xcite , was devoted to derive and discuss the bound on neutrino mass from supernova electron antineutrinos . our bound , eq .",

    "we argued that the result from sn1987a is relatively insensitive to the details of the emission model , as soon as the emission resembles the expectations of the standard scenario , that includes an initial phase of intense antineutrino luminosity .",

    "<S> based on recent improvements of the supernova electron antineutrino emission model , we update the limit on neutrino mass from the sn1987a data collected by kamiokande - ii , imb and baksan . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the limit of 5.8 ev at 95% cl , that we show to be remarkably insensitive to the astrophysical uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> also we evaluate the ultimate mass sensitivity of this method for a detector like super - kamiokande . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the bound lies in the sub - ev region , 0.8 ev at 95 % cl being a typical outcome , competitive with the values that are presently probed in laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> however , this bound is subject to strong statistical fluctuations , correlated to the characteristics of the first few events detected </S>",
    "<S> . we briefly comment on the prospects offered by future detectors .    </S>",
