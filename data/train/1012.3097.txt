    "<S> zero - range effective interactions are commonly used in nuclear physics and in other domains to describe many - body systems within the mean - field model . </S>",
    "<S> if they are used within a beyond - mean - field framework , contributions to the total energy that display an ultraviolet divergence are found . we propose a general strategy to regularize this divergence and we illustrate it in the case of the second - order corrections to the equation of state ( eos ) of uniform symmetric matter . by setting a momentum cutoff @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we show that for every ( physically meaningful ) value of @xmath0 it is possible to determine a new interaction such that the eos with the second - order corrections reproduces the empirical eos , with a fit of the same quality as that obtained at the mean - field level .    </S>",
    "<S> in many - body systems contact interactions are reasonable approximations to the realistic finite - range forces that can be employed in cases where the interaction range is smaller than the typical length scale represented by the interparticle distance . </S>",
    "<S> the main advantage of using zero - range interactions is that the equations to handle are greatly simplified . </S>",
    "<S> two examples of commonly used contact interactions are the skyrme forces which are quite popular in nuclear physics @xcite , and the contact interactions with coupling strengths depending on the @xmath1-wave scattering length which are employed for dilute atomic gases ( see , e.g. , ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . in general , </S>",
    "<S> effective interactions contain parameters that must be adjusted to reproduce a given set of observables ( for instance , in the nuclear case , binding energies and radii of a few selected nuclei , and bulk properties of nuclear matter ) . </S>",
    "<S> usually this is done at the self - consistent mean - field level . when going beyond this level , </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that the effective interaction has to be redetermined . </S>",
    "<S> however , trying to discuss this issue is impossible in the case of contact interactions , since going beyond mean field , e.g. , by including second - order corrections , implies dealing with contributions to the total energy which contain an ultraviolet divergence . </S>",
    "<S> many authors have studied the perturbation series for the energy of the electron gas @xcite and of nuclear systems @xcite . in all cases , </S>",
    "<S> the interaction is finite - range and no ultraviolet divergence appears . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we apply to a simple case a strategy to handle the contact interactions up to second order . </S>",
    "<S> we include a momentum cutoff @xmath0 among the parameters of the interaction , and we show that for every value of @xmath0 the other parameters can be determined in such a way that the total energy of the system with second - order contributions remains the same . </S>",
    "<S> this strategy , and the formulas we will show , are quite general and can be applied to different fermi systems . for the numerical application </S>",
    "<S> we restrict ourselves to symmetric nuclear matter , treated with a simplified zero - range interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> the second - order terms that contribute to the total energy in uniform matter and diverge in the case of contact forces are shown in the lower part of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figdiag1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the divergence is caused by the integration on @xmath2 and is somehow unphysical since the high - momentum states are certainly outside the scale at which effective forces are to be used .    </S>",
    "<S> in the case of effective interactions between point - nucleons , the cutoff @xmath0 must certainly be smaller than the momentum associated with the nucleon size , i.e. , smaller than @xmath3 2 @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , these interactions are used to describe giant resonances or rotational bands of nuclei and consequently the scale should be even smaller , perhaps around 0.5 @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> however , our procedure is tailored on the basic idea of renormalizable quantum - field theories : so , in principle , for any value of @xmath0 a new set of parameters is found which leads to the same equation of state ( eos ) -including the second - order contributions- . </S>",
    "<S> we show below that this is mathematically possible owing to the fact that the second - order correction is well - behaved as a function of the density . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we imitate the qed idea that the bare electron mass and charge can be chosen for every different energy cutoff in such a way that the physical values of mass and charge are always obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> an ultraviolet divergence appears already at the mean - field level in the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) @xcite or bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) @xcite models when zero - range forces are employed in the pairing channel . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> sophisticated regularization schemes exist in which the irregular term of the pairing field is suppressed and the dependence on the energy cutoff is eliminated . </S>",
    "<S> these techniques are commonly adopted for example in atomic physics in bdg models @xcite , and have been also employed in nuclear physics @xcite , but they can not be directly applied to the case of interest studied in the present work .    </S>",
    "<S> let us write the zero - range force as @xmath5 to make contact with the skyrme interactions @xcite the strength @xmath6 is written as @xmath7 and this corresponds to the so - called @xmath8 model that is a simplification of the usual skyrme model where the spin - dependent , velocity - dependent and spin - orbit terms are dropped . if the skyrme force is viewed as a @xmath9 matrix ( thus including ladder diagrams ) , the introduction of second - order contributions would in principle imply a double counting . however , our attitude is to consider as a matter of fact our interaction as phenomenological , and our framework as an effective theory where parameters are readjusted according to which diagrams are explicitly introduced . normalizing the single - particle wave functions within a box of volume @xmath10 , the hartree - fock ( hf ) potential - energy contribution ( upper part of fig . </S>",

    "<S> the energy per particle or eos is obtained by adding the kinetic contribution and reads in our case @xmath15 eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq5 ] ) coincides with the eos obtained with the skp parameter set @xcite , in which no contribution coming from the velocity - dependent terms appears and the effective mass coincides with the bare mass . since skp , as all the skyrme sets , has been fitted to reproduce within hf the basic features of the nuclear eos , one can consider its associated energy per particle as a benchmark which must be reproduced with reasonable accuracy for every value of @xmath0 when the second - order correction is included .        </S>",
