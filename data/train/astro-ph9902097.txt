    "the phenomenon of super large scale structure ( slss ) was first observed as rare peculiarities in the visible galaxy distribution , with extreme parameters .",
    "examples of this include the great void ( kirshner et al .",
    "1983 ) , the great attractor ( dressler et al . 1987 ) , the great wall ( de lapparent , geller , & huchra 1988 ; ramella , geller , & huchra 1992 ) , and the pisces - perseus supercluster ( giovanelli & haynes 1993 ) .",
    "several nearby superclusters of galaxies were described by oort ( 1983a , b ) .",
    "slss was also found in deep pencil beam redshift surveys ( broadhurst et al .",
    "1990 ; willmer et al .",
    "1994 ; buryak et al .",
    "1994 ; bellanger &   de lapparent 1995 ; cohen et al .",
    "1996 ) as rich galaxy clumps with typical separations in the range of @xmath7mpc ( @xmath8 is the hubble parameter in units of 100 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 ) .",
    "recently the analyses of rich galaxy surveys with an effective depth @xmath2@xmath10mpc , such as the durham / ukst galaxy redshift survey ( ratcliffe et al .",
    "1996 ) and the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ) ( shectman et al .",
    "1996 ) , have established the existence of the wall - like slss as typical phenomenon in the visible galaxy distribution incorporating @xmath2@xmath11% of galaxies ( doroshkevich et al .",
    "1996 , hereafter lcrs1 ; doroshkevich et al . 1997b , hereafter lcrs2 ; 1998a ; 1999 ) .",
    "the wall - like slss consists of structure elements with a typical diameter @xmath12mpc surrounding low - density regions ( ldr ) with a similar typical diameter @xmath13mpc . within the wall - like slss elements the observed galaxy distribution is also inhomogeneous ( see ,",
    "e.g. , fig . 5 of ramella et al .",
    "1992 ) , and galaxies are concentrated in high density clumps and filaments .    in ldr the galaxies are found to be concentrated within a random network of filaments . in distinction to the typical wall - like superclusters , the galaxy distribution in ldr is predominantly 1-dimensional with a mean separation of filaments @xmath2@xmath14mpc ( lcrs1 ) , and we call this network large scale structure ( lss ) .",
    "the lss incorporates also @xmath250% of galaxies and is clearly seen in many redshift catalogues of galaxies ( see , e.g. , de lapparent , geller & huchra 1988 ) .",
    "these results extend the range of investigated scales in the galaxy distribution up to @xmath15mpc .    while the lss was predicted by the nonlinear theory of gravitational instability ( zeldovich 1970 ) , and it was reproduced in simulations before its discovery in observations ( see , for reference , shandarin & zeldovich 1989 ) , the observation of the rich and typically wall - like slss was quite unexpected .",
    "thus , in simulations the representative slss was found only recently for a cdm model with low density and a cosmological constant ( @xmath0cdm , cole et al .",
    "this simulation demonstrates that for suitable parameters of cosmological models the formation of the wall - like slss is compatible with the standard cdm power spectrum of gaussian initial perturbations .",
    "the formation and evolution of structure on all scales are described by an approximate theoretical model ( demiaski & doroshkevich 1998a , b ) based on zeldovich nonlinear theory of gravitational instability ( zeldovich 1970 ; 1978 ; shandarin & zeldovich 1989 ) .",
    "the model shows that the slss formation can be related to matter infall into the large wells of the gravitational potential of the initial perturbations .",
    "this model connects the structure parameters with the main parameters of the underlying cosmological scenario and the initial power spectrum .",
    "it shows that the impact of large scale perturbations is important throughout all evolutionary stages . in particular , the influence of these perturbations modulates the merging of smaller structure elements promoting the evolution within the slss elements and depressing it in ldr .",
    "the simulations are able to take into account this interaction throughout all evolutionary stages and , therefore , are the most suitable way to study the lss and slss properties and evolution .",
    "this implies , however , that the simulations need to be performed in very large boxes both to provide us with reasonable statistics of the walls and , of particular importance , to correctly describe the large scale part of the initial power spectrum of perturbations , responsible for the wall formation and the mutual interaction of small and large scale perturbations . in practice",
    ", this means that we need extreme parameters in the simulations . on the other hand , in order to compare various cosmological models , a broad set of simulations has to be prepared .    here",
    "results are presented from the analysis of simulations using five cosmological models .",
    "it is shown that the models with high matter density , @xmath16 , can not reproduce adequately the observed properties of the large scale matter distribution .",
    "the models with lower matter density , in particular the ocdm and @xmath0cdm models , seem to be more promising , since they can reproduce the general observed characteristics of both the lss and the slss . in these models",
    "the rich structure elements , formed by a nonlinear matter compression , contain a significant matter fraction , @xmath17 , which can be easily discriminated .",
    "a more detailed investigation of the nonlinear matter evolution on large scales is a further goal of this paper .",
    "the small scale matter clustering resulting in the destruction of structure elements restricts the class of cosmological models which are capable of reproducing the observed lss and slss .",
    "the instability of a sheetlike matter distribution similar to the observed and simulated slss was considered ( in the linear approximation ) by doroshkevich ( 1980 ) and vishniac ( 1983 ) , and it was recently simulated by valinia et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "following our previous papers ( lcrs1 ; lcrs2 ; doroshkevich et al .",
    "1997 ) we concentrate on the geometrical properties of the matter distribution , in particular , to the proper sizes and spatial distribution of filaments and wall - like structure elements .",
    "the popular correlation analysis is not so useful at scales @xmath18mpc discussed below , and other techniques provide us with more essential results .",
    "we employ the core - sampling approach introduced by buryak et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , the standard cluster analysis supplemented by the inertia tensor technique ( vishniac 1986 ; babul & starkman 1992 ) , the analysis of the variations of number of clusters vs. linking length ( ncll method , doroshkevich et al .",
    "1997b ) , and the minimal spanning tree ( mst ) technique ( barrow et al . 1985 ;",
    "van  de  weygaert 1991 ) .",
    "these methods were utilized recently for the investigation of structures in the lcrs ( cp .",
    "lcrs1 and lcrs2 ) and durham / ukst redshift surveys ( doroshkevich et al . 1999 ) .",
    "these results shall be used for the comparison with the structure parameters derived from simulations .",
    "the different methods are complementary to each other , and , thus , they allow us to characterize the simulated matter distribution in different important aspects .    the observed distribution of galaxies and the simulated distribution of the dm can not be identical as the galaxy formation is sensitive to additional factors ( e.g. , to the reheating ) and , moreover , galaxies , probably , mark only the highest peaks of density perturbations .",
    "this means that some parameters of dm structure elements such as their overdensity and proper sizes can differ from that found in observational catalogues .",
    "the comparative analysis performed for one simulation ( doroshkevich et al .",
    "1998a ) confirms , that in some respect the spatial distributions of dm and ` galaxies ' are different .",
    "a more detailed comparison of the observed and simulated matter distribution implies an identification of ` galaxies ' in the simulated dm distribution .",
    "this means that a certain bias model needs to be utilized ( see , e.g. , discussions in sahni & coles 1995 , and cole et al .",
    "both problems are , however , equally important , and the distributions of both the galaxies and the dm must be studied .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the simulations and the analysis techniques utilized are shortly described in secs . 2 and 3 .",
    "4 the general characteristics of the considered simulations are discussed that allow us to roughly discriminate the cosmological models and to select the most realistic ones for a more detailed investigation .",
    "our main results are presented in secs . 5 and 6 .",
    "7 is devoted to the comparison with theoretical expectations of the dm distribution , and in sec .",
    "8 we discuss mock galaxy catalogues using some simple bias models .",
    "the conclusion and a discussion can be found in sec .",
    "we used five cosmological models as a basis for our analysis .",
    "the cobe normalized scdm model is taken as a reference model despite its difficulties in explaining already standard measures of galaxy clustering as the power spectrum and the correlation function of galaxies and galaxy clusters ( cp .",
    "e.g.  ostriker , 1993 ) .",
    "alternative models with @xmath6 include modifications of the primordial power spectrum , in particular by introducing a tilt @xmath19 of the power spectrum ( tcdm ) , or a break at a certain scale , ( bcdm ) .",
    "both are inflation motivated , using either an exponential inflation potential ( lucchin & matarrese 1985 ) , or a double inflation scenario ( gottlber , mller , & starobinsky 1991 ) .",
    "the bcdm is specified by two parameters , the location of the break at @xmath20mpc , and the relative power on both sides of the break , @xmath21 .",
    "these parameters were originally chosen to obtain optimal linear fits to the various large - scale structure observations ( gottlber , mcket , & starobinsky 1994 ) , and later tested against @xmath22-body simulations ( amendola et al .",

    "the amplitude of perturbations is characterized by the mass variance for the linear spectrum at the scale @xmath35mpc , @xmath34 , and the 3-dimensional velocity dispersion , @xmath28 , gained from all dark matter particles in the simulation .",
    "the simulations were run in boxes of comoving size @xmath39mpc and @xmath40mpc , respectively , to provide a good statistics of perturbations in the range of wave numbers @xmath41mpc responsible for the slss formation and , so , to improve the statistical characteristics of slss elements and the description of the interaction of small and large scale perturbations . for such boxes",
    "the formation of the majority of structure elements is described by higher harmonics of the primordial density waves , with @xmath42 .",
    "we use the pm code , described in more detail in kates et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and retzlaff et al .",

    "these parameters provide a resolution @xmath45mpc and the mass resolution @xmath2@xmath46 .",
    "most statistics can be calculated only for subsamples of the huge data sets .",
    "therefore , we mostly used slices of thickness 50@xmath33mpc of the simulation box , that are about 10% of the complete volume .",
    "even this volume provides us with a reasonable representation of the slss elements .",
    "this high stability of structure parameters is a direct consequence of the large box size used . to test the reliability",
    ", we repeated the analysis for different slices and constructed some statistics for the full volume taking the @xmath0cdm1 model .",
    "the main difference between the analysis of the full sample and slices is a variations of the mean velocity dispersion of clusters by @xmath47 percent .",
    "similar differences are characteristic of the different realizations of the same cosmological model ( scdm1 vs. scdm2 , @xmath0cdm1 vs. @xmath0cdm2 ) . below",
    "we give the basic results for the larger simulations only , they are denoted as scdm and @xmath0cdm .",
    "the comparison of simulated and observed parameters of the slss has to be done in the redshift space while the theoretical predictions are usually made in the comoving space .",
    "hence , our analysis was performed twice . in the case of redshift space",
    ", we added an apparent displacement corresponding to the peculiar velocity of the particles along one axis divided by the hubble constant .",
    "the comparison of results from real and redshift space allows us to establish the influence of the velocity dispersion on the final estimates .",
    "1 shows a wedge diagram of the simulated matter distribution in redshift space for the @xmath0cdm model at redshifts @xmath48 . to each particle we assigned a luminosity chosen at random from a schechter luminosity function typical for the lcrs galaxies ( lin et al .",
    "we projected the particles into a wedge of angular extension @xmath49 , and we kept simulated galaxies in the magnitude range @xmath50 , about the range of the lcrs .",
    "the mock sample contains about 7500 galaxies .",
    "the figure illustrates that the overdense regions form almost a percolating system , with huge structured systems between radial velocities of @xmath51 km / s .",
    "a sparse filamentary matter distribution occupies the low - density regions .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the investigation of large scale structure , and specific methods are to be used in order to characterize the simulated matter distribution .",
    "these methods are not so popular as , for example , the correlation analysis , but they are well defined and allow us to characterize the matter distribution on large scales comparable with observations and with the scales predicted by theoretical considerations .      the core - sampling method proposed by buryak et al .",
    "( 1994 ) was described in detail in lcrs1 and tested with voronoi tesselations by doroshkevich , gottlber , & madsen ( 1997 ) .",
    "it allows us to discriminate the filamentary and the sheet - like structure elements and to find two quantitative characteristics of the structure , namely , the surface density of filaments , @xmath52 , that is the mean number of filaments crossing a randomly oriented unit area ( i.e.  1 @xmath53mpc@xmath54 ) , and the linear density of sheets , @xmath55 , that is the number of sheets crossing the unit length ( i.e.  1 @xmath33mpc ) of a random straight line .",
    "these parameters are equivalent to the mean separation between sheet - like structure elements , @xmath56 , and filaments , @xmath57 : @xmath58 i.e. these lengths represent the mean free path between sheet - like and filamentary structure elements .",
    "the core - sampling method also allows us to determine the masses and velocities of structure elements that intersect a sampling core , i.e. it provides the surface mass density and dynamical characteristics of structure elements .",
    "these parameters are used for the comparison with theoretical expectations .",
    "the mst is a _",
    "unique network _ associated with a given point sample and connects all points of the sample to a _ tree _ in a special and unique manner .",
    "some definitions and capabilities of this approach are described by barrow , bhavsar , & sonoda ( 1985 ) and van  de  weygaert ( 1991 ) . here",
    "we will restrict our investigation to the analysis of the _ frequency distribution of the mst edge lengths _ @xmath59 ( the fdmst method ) .",
    "the potential of the mst approach is not exhausted by this application .",
    "it allows us to characterize , in particular , the morphology of structure elements and the typical size of the structure network .    at large distances",
    "any correlations between the particle positions are small , and it can be expected , that the edge length distribution @xmath59 is similar to that of a poisson distribution .",
    "but for filaments this distribution will be dominated by a poisson distribution with 1-dimensional support ( 1d ) , whereas for sheet - like elements a nearly 2-dimensional ( 2d ) random point distribution is typical .",
    "this means that the function @xmath59 can be used to characterize statistically the dominant point distribution in the sample . to do this",
    ", the fdmst can be fitted to the six - parameter function @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the edge lengths and the mean edge length of the tree , and @xmath65 provides the normalization of the fdmst .",
    "the function @xmath66 represents a power law both for small and large @xmath67 , but it allows a continuous variation of the power index @xmath68 with the edge lengths @xmath67 .",
    "here we are mainly interested in the power index @xmath68 for larger @xmath67 that characterizes the underlying geometry of the point distribution on large scales .",
    "a poisson point distribution with 1d and 2d support is characterized by the power indices @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the asymptote of the function @xmath68 at large @xmath67 characterizes the geometry of the structure elements , and it can be compared with similar parameters recently found for the observed galaxy distribution ( lcrs2 ) .",
    "this approach was tested with the simulations of 1d , 2d and 3d poissonian - like point distributions .",
    "the standard cluster analysis ( friend - of - friends method ) is used widely in numerical simulations and is well known ( see , e.g. , sahni & coles 1995 ) . here",
    "we employ it , first of all , in order to define the structure elements for a more detailed investigation of their properties .",
    "the cluster analysis can also be used for the description of the matter distribution on large scales .",
    "the function @xmath59 is closely connected with the number of clusters @xmath70 because @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the number of points in the sample under investigation .",
    "therefore , the fdmst and ncll approaches are similar in many respects .",
    "we use a five - parameter fit of the cluster number vs. linking length relations , @xmath73 : @xmath74 here @xmath75 is defined by ( 3.2 ) , @xmath76 is the dimensionless linking length , @xmath77 are dimensionless fit parameters , and @xmath78 is the 3d number density of points .    here",
    "we are mainly interested in the variation of the power index @xmath79 at large @xmath76 .",
    "this method is complementary to the fdmst analysis , and it allows us to get an independent fit to the power index @xmath79 at large @xmath76",
    ".    the ncll method can also be extended , and , for the more detailed characteristics of the matter distribution , the variation of single particles , doublets , triplets and other clusters vs. linking length can be considered as well . in this paper",
    ", we consider only the total number of clusters @xmath73 for the comparison with results obtained with the fdmst .",
    "the sizes of structure elements can be found with the inertia tensor method ( vishniac 1986 ; babul & starkman 1992 ) . for each cluster",
    "the inertia tensor @xmath80 is expressed as @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the coordinates of the particles and of the center of mass of the cluster , respectively , @xmath84 is the number of cluster members . the conventional normalization @xmath85 has been taken to be consistent with a homogeneous ellipsoid . hence , the principal values of the tensor @xmath80 , namely the length ( diameter ) , @xmath86 , the width , @xmath87 , and the thickness , @xmath88 , ( @xmath89 ) , give us objective estimates of the cluster size and of the volume , @xmath90 , and of the mean overdensity of cluster , @xmath91 @xmath92 where @xmath84 is a number of point in cluster .",
    "this raw estimate is clearly of limited accuracy , but it is easy to calculate . the reliability of this estimate is high for compact regular clusters , and in general it depends on the cluster shape , in particular on its lumpiness ( see , e.g. , sathyaprakash et al .",
    "we found from the simulations , that for large linking lengths , clusters are very lumpy in its outer regions .",
    "then the ellipsoidal approximation leads to an artificial growth of the width and the thickness of the clusters .",
    "however , the cluster diameter @xmath86 provides a stable characteristic of the cluster size .",
    "the cluster analysis shows that rich structure elements ( rse ) are usually represented by rather compact wall - like objects , and our methods give us more reliable information about their properties , some of which can be directly connected with the parameters of the cosmological model ( see discussion in sec .",
    "in contrast , the discrimination and identification of poor structure elements is always difficult , as in the observed galaxy distribution they usually represent a filamentary component in a random network .",
    "this means that the discrimination and statistical description of such elements is often uncertain as their shapes are entangled due to many irregular branches .",
    "because of this , in this paper we give the main attention to the rse",
