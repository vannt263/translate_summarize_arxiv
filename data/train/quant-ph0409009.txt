    "in quantifying quantum entanglement of two - qubit mixed states , various measures are commonly applied @xcite : the relative entropy of entanglement ( ree ) @xcite  a measure of the `` distance '' ( or distinguishability ) of an entangled state from the set of disentangled states , the ( logarithmic ) negativity @xcite  a measure of entanglement cost under operations preserving the positivity of partial transpose ( ppt ) @xcite , and the concurrence @xcite  a measure of the entanglement of formation @xcite .",
    "it can be shown analytically that the upper bounds of the ree for a given concurrence @xcite and of the negativity for a given concurrence @xcite are reached by pure states .",
    "so one could conjecture that pure states have also the highest ree for a given negativity .",
    "however , we will demonstrate that there are mixed states exhibiting the ree for a given negativity ( in some range ) higher than for pure states . before going into details",
    "let us briefly describe the entanglement measures .",
    "the relative entropy of entanglement in two - qubit systems according to vedral _",
    "_ can be defined as @xcite @xmath0 where the minimum is taken over the set @xmath1 of all separable states @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is the quantum relative entropy @xmath4 between states @xmath5 and @xmath2 .",
    "the ree measures a quasidistance , say @xmath6 , of the entangled state @xmath5 from the closest separable state ( css ) @xmath2 .",
    "based on the quantum version of sanov s theorem , one can also interpret the ree as a measure of statistical distinguishability of @xmath5 .",
    "the choice of @xmath7 as a candidate for @xmath8 is by no means unique , although this is , to our knowledge , the only proposal that coincides for pure states with the von neumann entropy of the reduced density operator .",
    "also note that @xmath9 for a two - qubit state @xmath5 can be defined by @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the minimal eigenvalue of the partial transpose , denoted by @xmath12 , of @xmath5 .",
    "the negativity is directly related to the peres - horodecki criterion @xcite . the logarithmic negativity , given by @xmath13 $ ] , is a measure of the entanglement cost @xmath14 under ppt operations @xcite .",
    "the negativity and logarithmic negativity are monotonically related , reaching unity for bell states and vanishing for separable states .",
    "so for simplicity of our further analysis , we use the negativity instead of the logarithmic negativity .",
    "another measure of entanglement is the entanglement of formation @xmath15 @xcite or , equivalently for two qubit states , the wootters concurrence @xcite defined as @xmath16 , where the @xmath17 s stand for the square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the pauli spin matrix .    in the last section",
    ", we also analyze the entanglement of distillation , @xmath20 @xcite , a measure of the entanglement as the fraction of bell states that can be distilled using the optimal purification protocol .",
    "= 8.5 cm    the ree and the entanglement of formation coincide for pure states , but for mixed states the inequality @xmath22 holds @xcite . as the concurrence is monotonically related to the entanglement of formation for an arbitrary state , the upper bound of the ree for a given concurrence is reached for pure states . on the other hand , as shown by verstraete _",
    "@xcite , the negativity @xmath23 of an arbitrary state can never exceed its concurrence @xmath24 .",
    "the upper bound of the negativity for a given concurrence , i.e. , @xmath25 , is reached for a class of states for which the eigenvector of the partially transposed @xmath5 corresponding to the negative eigenvalue is a bell state @xcite .",
    "pure states and also some mixed states ( including bell - diagonal states ) belong to this class .",
    "thus , we see that mixed states can not give higher values of the ree and negativity for a given concurrence than those for pure states . in the following",
    "we will show that the mixed - state ree can exceed the pure - state ree for a given negativity .",
    "an arbitrary two - qubit pure state can be changed by local rotations into a state of the form ( @xmath26 ) @xmath27 as can be shown by applying the schmidt decomposition @xcite .",
    "the negativity of @xmath28 is simply described by @xmath29 , while the ree , being equal to the entanglement of formation , can be given as a function of @xmath30 as @xmath31\\right ) , \\label{n05}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the binary entropy .",
    "equation ( [ n05 ] ) corresponds to the well - known wootters relation between the concurrence and the entanglement of formation @xcite , since @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    in comparison with pure states ,",
    "let us analyze a mixture of a maximally entangled state , say the `` triplet '' state @xmath35 , and a separable state orthogonal to it , say @xmath36 , i.e. , @xcite , @xmath37 where the parameter @xmath38 . for brevity , we shall refer to ( [ n06 ] ) as the horodecki state , although alternatively it could be named after others ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the negativity of the horodecki state reads as @xmath39 while the ree as a function of @xmath40 can be given by vedral - plenio s formula @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 . by comparing the rees for the horodecki and pure states",
    "we observe that    @xmath43    where @xmath44 and @xmath45 as shown in the inset plot of fig .",
    "the inequality ( [ n09a ] ) can also be shown by expanding ( [ n05 ] ) and ( [ n08 ] ) in power series of @xmath21 close to zero , then one gets @xmath46 and negligibly small @xmath47 . to show inequality ( [ n09b ] ) more clearly , we can expand ( [ n05 ] ) and ( [ n08 ] ) around @xmath48 close to one , then we have @xmath49 , which is greater than @xmath50 .",
    "thus , a comparison of ( [ n05 ] ) and ( [ n08 ] ) demonstrates the main point of this paper : there are mixed states having the ree for a given negativity ( in some range ) higher than that of pure states .",
    "so far , we have analyzed the horodecki states , which correspond to the broken curve in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "now , we will give analytical examples of mixed states more entangled than pure states , which could correspond to any point in the dark region in fig .",
    "the desired mixed states can be generated from the horodecki state @xmath51 by mixing it with the separable state @xmath52 closest to @xmath51 as follows : @xmath53 defined for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and the corresponding css is given by ( @xmath57 ) @xmath58 by virtue of the vedral - plenio theorem @xcite , state ( [ n12 ] ) is the css for @xmath59 for any @xmath60 .",
    "thus , we find that the ree for @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "the choice of @xmath65 , given by ( [ n11 ] ) , implies that @xmath21 is just the negativity of @xmath61 . for @xmath66 ,",
    "the state ( [ n10 ] ) goes into the horodecki state , given by ( [ n06 ] ) .",
    "states corresponding to all points in the blue region in fig .",
    "1 can be generated from @xmath61 by changing @xmath21 from 0 to @xmath67 and slightly increasing @xmath68 from the value of @xmath69 . by choosing properly @xmath54 and @xmath70 , the state @xmath61 corresponding to any point in the entire dark region in fig .",
    "2(a ) can be generated .",
    "it is seen that pure and mixed states having the negativity higher than that @xmath51 , which correspond to the white region under the thick solid curve in fig .",
    "2(a ) , are not included in the family of states @xmath59 .",
    "by contrast , dark region in fig .",
    "2(b ) corresponds to states that can be obtained from pure states @xmath28 by mixing them with the separable states @xmath71 closest to @xmath72 .",
    "they can be given , in analogy to ( [ n10 ] ) , as @xmath73 where @xmath74 $ ] for @xmath75 and @xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "the bounds on @xmath78 are obtained from the requirement that @xmath79 should be a positive semidefinite operator . in special cases for @xmath80 ,",
    "the mixed state @xmath81 becomes the pure state @xmath82 .",
    "in analogy to the state ( [ n10 ] ) , the vedral - plenio theorem guarantees that the css for @xmath79 is the same as for the pure state @xmath28 .",
    "thus , we can calculate the ree for ( [ n14 ] ) arriving at @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the ree , given by ( [ n15 ] ) , for @xmath80 goes into ( [ n05 ] ) as expected .",
    "the lower bound of the rees for both @xmath79 and @xmath61 is the same and given by @xmath86 with the help of the vedral _ et al . _",
    "results @xcite , we can conclude that the ree , given by ( [ n16 ] ) , is the same as for a bell - diagonal state defined by @xmath87 where @xmath88 are the bell states , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath21 is the negativity @xmath91 . specifically ,",
    "the states ( [ n10 ] ) for @xmath92 and ( [ n14 ] ) for @xmath93 go into the following bell - diagonal states @xmath94 @xmath95 respectively , where the bell states are given in the following order @xmath96 for which @xmath97=0.0391\\ldots$ ] .",
    "the question arises about the highest possible difference for an arbitrary mixed state .",
    "this problem is strictly related to finding the upper bound of the ree vs negativity .",
    "there has been a long - standing open problem of finding a closed analytical formula for the ree for two qubits , which corresponds to finding the @xmath2 for a given entangled state @xmath5 @xcite and it is argued that the analytical solution does not exist @xcite . moreover , there has not yet been an efficient numerical method proposed to calculate the ree for an arbitrary entangled mixed state even in case of two qubits .",
    "analytical formulas for the ree are known only for some special sets of states with high symmetry @xcite .",
    "thus , usually , numerical methods for calculating the ree have to be applied @xcite .",
    "the complexity of the two - qubit problem can be explained by virtue of caratheodory s theorem , which implies that minimalization of the quantum relative entropy @xmath7 should be performed over @xmath98 real parameters describing decomposed @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "usually @xcite , gradient - type algorithms are applied to perform the minimalization .",
    "ehek and hradil @xcite proposed a method resembling a state reconstruction based on the maximum likelihood principle .",
    "@xcite designed a hierarchy of more and more complex operational separability criteria for which convex optimization methods ( known as semidefinite programs ) can be applied efficiently .    nevertheless , there is a compact - form solution to the inverse problem , which characterizes an entangled state @xmath5 for a given full - rank @xmath2 @xcite : @xmath99 @xmath100 and @xmath101 and @xmath102 is the kernel of @xmath103 , while @xmath104 and @xmath105 are eigenstates and eigenvalues of @xmath2 , respectively .",

    "the solution can be applied also for lower - rank csss in a limiting sequence from a full - rank state by noting that the ree is a continuous function .",
    "we have applied two approaches in our numerical simulations . in the standard approach ,",
    "the states are chosen at random and their @xmath109 and @xmath21 are calculated numerically using a simplex search method without using numerical or analytic gradients . however , given the fact that no closed formula exists for @xmath109 @xcite , it is more logical to choose random states ( call them @xmath2 ) on the boundary of the separability region and generate entangled states @xmath5 for which @xmath2 is the css by applying eqs .",
    "( [ n50])([n53 ] ) . the latter method is faster by three orders of magnitude than the standard one .",
    "figure 3 shows the results of our simulations for random rank-2 and rank-3 states . for brevity ,",
    "we have omitted a similar figure for random rank-4 states .",
    "the simulations confirm our analytical predictions that the mixed - state ree can exceed the pure - state ree but also indicate lower and upper bounds of the ree vs negativity .",

    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated that there are mixed states that have the ree in some range of a fixed negativity higher than the pure - state ree for the same negativity .",
