    "the question of the origins of intermittency in turbulence and its relation _ inter alia _ to small structures is also of central importance in the areas of non - equilibrium statistical physics , fluid dynamics , astrophysics , and geophysics @xcite .    in this paper",

    "the idea is to reduce the number of degrees of freedom with minimal breaking of the original symmetries of the system .",
    "the goal is to understand what are the key ingredients in the dynamics necessary to reproduce the main statistical properties of the original non - decimated burgers equation and therefore to understand the robustness and origins of its shock - like structures .    over the past few decades various models of intermittency",
    "have been developed based on the idea of energy cascade in physical space  @xcite .",
    "these contrast with other attempts , based on the spectral space , involving statistical closures and renormalization group methods . despite their success for certain problems , none of these attempts have been able to quantitatively connect anomalous scaling with the structure of the original equation , and hence with its intermittent behavior . as a result , our understanding of anomalous scaling is still based on phenomenological real - space descriptions and real - space methodologies .",
    "intermittency is intimately connected with ideas of energy transfer from large to small scales .",
    "working in fourier space should , hopefully , open new and possible ways to understand this cascade . in a recent work  @xcite ,",
    "the idea of _ fractal decimation _ was introduced , with the aim of studying the evolution of the navier - stokes equations on an effective dimension @xmath0 out of an integer @xmath4-dimensional embedding manifold .",
    "this is done by introducing a quenched mode - reduction in fourier space such that in a sphere of radius @xmath5 the number of modes that are involved in the dynamics scale as @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the effective fractal dimension of the system ) for large @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "this approach allows us to decimate the number of triad interactions in fourier space as a function of the wavenumbers involved as well as to consider the problem in non - integer , fractal dimensions @xmath0 . in ref.@xcite the first results for a set of simulations of the decimated",
    ", three - dimensional ( 3d ) navier - stokes equation have been reported with the intriguing conclusion that fractal fourier decimation leads , rather quickly ( i.e. , for a very small reduction of the fourier modes @xmath8 ) , to vanishing intermittency .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the same problem for the one - dimensional burgers equation .",
    "the main advantage with respect to the previous attempt on the 3d navier - stokes is that here , due to the simpler structure of the problem , numerical simulations can reach much higher resolutions and therefore assess , in a fully quantitative way , the problem of scaling and corrections to it .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : description ] we introduce the decimated burgers equation and give details about our numerical simulations .",

    "we can then write the decimated burgers equation , which gives the evolution for the decimated field @xmath27 as : @xmath28 with initial conditions @xmath29 @xcite . when @xmath30 we recover the usual one - dimensional equation .",
    "it is important to notice that the fractal projector in front of the non - linear term in eq .",
    "( [ d - burgers ] ) is fundamental to ensure that the non - linear convolution does not activate the decimated degrees of freedom during the system dynamics .",
    "it is interesting to note that the fractal decimation , as well as any other galerkin truncation , preserves the inviscid conservation of the first three moments of the velocity field only .",
    "we performed a set of numerical simulations of eq .",

    "we use a pseudo - spectral method with a second - order adams - bashforth scheme to integrate in time .",
    "details of all simulations can be found in table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "we note that the values of @xmath23 decreases with the dimension @xmath0 ( see table [ tab : table1 ] ) ; indeed as the decimation becomes stronger the contribution of the non - linear advection term becomes weaker  @xcite . hence to compare results from simulations with different values of @xmath0 , we use smaller and smaller values of @xmath23 in order to observe a similar extension of the inertial range .",
    "we do not know if the decimated equations are well behaved as @xmath37 and if the system develops a dissipative anomaly leading to a stationary behavior for all @xmath0 .",
    "this is an interesting point that will be addressed in future work .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     hereafter we analyze statistical properties for either a single quenched realization of the decimation mask or after a further averaging over different realizations of the quenched disorder .",
    "we indicate with @xmath38 the average over time for a single realization of the decimation mask ; while @xmath39 is used to denote an average over different quenched masks , where each mask acts as a projector .",
    "it is well known that the ordinary forced burgers equation develops several discontinuities ( shocks ) connected by smooth , continuous ramps as it evolves in time [ see fig .",
    "( [ fig : time_evolve]a ) ] .",
    "as soon as we introduce the fractal decimation projector , several sharp oscillatory structures appear in the solution for @xmath40 , even for mild decimation ( @xmath1 ) , as seen in fig [ fig : time_evolve](b ) .",
    "such structures , although reminiscent of features ( _ tygers _ ) of the galerkin - truncated burgers equation @xcite , are crucially different because they are spatially much more delocalized .",
    "the first question we want to address is the effect of decimation on the mean spectral properties .",
    "we define the energy spectrum for a general fractal dimension as @xmath41 .",
    "since fractal decimation does not break scaling invariance of the original equation in the inviscid limit , we still expect to observe a power - law dependency as a function of the wavenumber @xmath42 .",
    "another important quantity is the spectrum averaged over the quenched disorder : @xmath43 where with @xmath44 we indicate different realizations of the decimation mask . from these definitions",
    ", one can infer the following relations : @xmath45 where we have assumed that the scaling properties of the velocity field depend only on the fractal dimension @xmath0 but are independent of the particular @xmath46-th realization of the decimation mask . to ensure the validity of eq .",
    "( [ spect_exp ] ) we need to use @xmath47 large enough to smooth out the gaps produced by the different masks in the energy spectra .    for the one - dimensional burgers equation , because of the presence of the shock(s )",
    ", the energy spectrum scales as @xmath48 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_expo](a ) a log - log plot of @xmath49 versus @xmath5 for @xmath50 is shown .",
    "the mean energy spectrum @xmath51 becomes shallower when decreasing @xmath0 . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_expo](a ) , we show the dependency of the scaling exponents on @xmath0 .",
    "it changes from @xmath52 for @xmath30 to @xmath53 for @xmath54 , with a sharp transition around @xmath55 . in the same inset",
    "we also show the validity of the scaling relation eq.([spect_exp ] ) .    the existence of this quasi - singular behavior for the spectral slope at @xmath56 might indicate the presence of an intermediate asymptotics spoiling the true behavior in the limit of vanishing viscosity . to confirm this possibility , we show , in fig . [",
    "fig : spectra_expo](b ) , the energy spectrum @xmath49 versus @xmath5 for @xmath57 at various values of the viscosity and resolution .",
    "it is seen that there is a trend , when decreasing viscosity , towards the development of an inertial range scaling @xmath58 .",
    "this suggests that , asymptotically , as @xmath59 , the true scaling exponent @xmath60 for any @xmath61 .",
    "this observation would imply that the continuous transition seen in the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_expo](a ) is a consequence of some intermediate asymptotics and that fourier decimation is a singular perturbation for the spectral scaling properties .          in order to substantiate the relation between the change in the spectrum and the suppression of shocks we analyze the physical space velocity field .",
    "this is also required to address the issue of anomalous scaling due to the lack of a clear definition of intermittency in fourier space .",
    "intermittent features in turbulent flows are quantified by the statistics of multi - points correlation function or the so called structure functions : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and the angular brackets , @xmath64 , denote space and time averaging over the statistically stationary state .",
    "it is important to remark that the spatial average is equivalent to an average over the quenched disorder . to prove this we notice that :    @xmath65    where we have used the scaling properties of the probability defining the decimation mask and the fact that @xmath66 , where the symbol @xmath67 stands for statistically `` in law '' , i.e. , the two sides have the same scaling properties when averaged on different realizations of the fractal projector",
    "this relation is validated in fig .",
    "[ fig : flat_and_s2](a ) where the second - order structure functions obtained both from a single mask ( continuous black line ) and from an average over different realizations of the quenched masks ( square symbols in red ) are shown to be identical .",
    "for this reason henceforth , we stop distinguishing between @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "to understand the effects of decimation on intermittency , we measure the flatness of structure functions :    @xmath70 ^ 2 } \\sim r^{\\gamma_d}\\ ] ]    as a function of @xmath71 for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "let us stress that for the 1d burgers equations , phenomenological and theoretical arguments @xcite predict @xmath72 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , which give for the flatness the scaling @xmath73 , [ fig .",
    "[ fig : flat_and_s2](b ) , inset ] . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : flat_and_s2](b ) we find that scaling exponents , @xmath74 , present the same sharp transition already observed in the slope of the energy spectra for @xmath75 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_expo](a ) , inset ] .",
    "thus , surgeries on the fourier space and dimensional reduction seem to suppress intermittency in hydrodynamics ( as has also been seen in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . we can not refrain from noticing that this seems to be in contrast with the usual phenomenology of cascade dynamics , built in terms of local - fourier interactions .",
    "the results obtained in the previous section lead us to address the question of whether intermittency is indeed washed out by any small perturbation of the fourier dynamics  bad news for modeling  or if it is masked by new leading fluctuations introduced by the modified non - linear dynamics . to answer this question",
    ", we perform a systematic analysis of the scaling properties of structure functions by changing the fractal fourier dimension @xmath0 . it is important to decompose the structure function into contributions from the negative and positive increments of the velocity field @xcite .",
    "we thus define @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 , whence the structure function @xmath79 .",
    "to improve the statistics , odd - order structure functions are often measured in terms of the absolute value of velocity increments ; in this case we will obviously have @xmath80 . to study the scaling properties it is customary to analyze logarithmic local slopes :    @xmath81    the scaling exponents of order @xmath82 in the inertial range",
    "are obtained as a best fit to the local exponents in the interval of scales where they are close to a constant . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sf_exp ] we show the result for both @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( see figure captions for details ) .        from a comparison of the two figures",
    "one can conclude a few important facts .",
    "first , there is a clear tendency for even - order moments to approach the non - intermittent scaling behavior with exponent @xmath85 as soon as @xmath2 ; the agreement being almost perfect already at @xmath86 .",
    "second , the odd - order moments of the structure functions , defined without absolute values , seem to maintain a memory of the original non - decimated burgers behavior , namely @xmath87 , even for small fractal dimensions @xmath88 .",
    "let us note that this behavior is not entirely unexpected .",
    "first , the emergence of a linear scaling @xmath85 is in agreement with the observation of the spectral slope @xmath89 and with the absence of intermittency .",
    "figure [ fig : sf_exp](a ) is thus a demonstration of the suppression of intermittency in burgers flows under fractal fourier decimation , similar to what has been observed for the navier - stokes evolution in ref .",
    "the deviation from the values @xmath85 for the odd - order moments is explained by noticing that the third - order structure function must satisfy an analytical relation similar to the krmn - howarth @xmath90 law of navier - stokes , namely : @xmath91 for all @xmath0 and where @xmath92 is the mean energy dissipation .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : sf_exp](b ) clearly supports this statement . a possible way to rationalize these apparently contradictory results",
    "is to suppose that decimation introduces a distributed noise at all scales , leading to a typical scaling @xmath93 on top of an underlying burgers - like dynamics .",
    "if this is true , it should be detectable by looking separately at positive or negative velocity increments . as a result",
    ", we suggest the presence of two different asymptotics : @xmath94 where the first term on the right hand side of the equations should have pre - factors that go to zero for @xmath95 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : twofit ] ) the burgers scaling @xmath96 is present only for the negative increments and _ smooth _ denotes the sub - leading differentiable terms induced by the viscous contribution @xmath97 .",
    "( color online ) the probability density function ( pdf ) of the velocity increments at a scale @xmath98 ; the pdf is normalized by its standard deviation .",
    "the different lines correspond to different dimensions @xmath0 as shown in the legend . ]    in order to quantitatively check the above prediction , we perform a series of systematic fits to @xmath99 by using the following interpolation expression for the asymptotic behavior ( [ eq : twofit ] ) :    @xmath100    where @xmath101 are fitting constants and @xmath102 is the dissipative scale such that for @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "the overall factor @xmath105 is used to saturate the inertial range scaling for @xmath71 beyond the forcing length scale . @xmath106 and @xmath107 are estimated as the best - fitting parameters . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : interpola ] ) it is easy to recognize that the first term on the right hand side of both equations represents the effect introduced by the decimation , while the second term ( present only for negative increments ) represents the standard shock - dominated burgers scaling ( plus viscous contributions ) .",
    "clearly , if @xmath108 for all @xmath0 , we have moments of even order that are dominated by the @xmath85 scaling while moments of odd order have the usual burgers scaling .",
    "in figs . [",
    "fig : fitting_sf](a ) and [ fig : fitting_sf](b ) we show the best fit by using these expressions for the third - order moment ( @xmath109 ) and @xmath110 for both the ( a ) negative and ( b ) positive increments . for the case of negative increments",
    ", we also show the best fit with and without the shock contribution to highlight the importance of the shock to reconstruct the right behavior for @xmath111 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_no_shock](a ) and for @xmath109 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_no_shock](b ) .",
    "as one can see , the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : interpola ] ) are able to reconstruct the local scaling properties in a robust way , showing that our phenomenological model is _ not incompatible _ with the data .",
    "finally we measure the probability density function of the velocity increments at different scales ( fig . [",
    "fig : pdf ] ) .",
    "this clearly shows the emergence of non - trivial fluctuations for positive velocity increments at decreasing fractal dimension @xmath0 ; such fluctuations are almost absent in the standard one - dimensional burgers case . in summary , all our results indicate that while on the one hand the numerical evidence point toward a robustness of the shock structure ( as also visually confirmed from fig . [",
    "fig : time_evolve ] ) , on the other hand , decimation introduces important fluctuations that spoil the scaling of the original undecimated equation without modifying the existence of a constant - flux of energy from large to small - scales .",
    "let us now turn to a few theoretical considerations for understanding the behavior of @xmath84 .",
    "we first recall that just like any galerkin truncation  @xcite , the fractal fourier decimation constrains the number of conserved quantities to the first three moments of the velocity in the burgers equation . in particular , this allows the conservation of a cubic moment whose relative flux would yield @xmath112 , which , in turn , would be consistent with our numerical result @xmath113 .",
    "another possible explanation for the @xmath114 scaling is the idea that a new decorrelation mechanism in the shell - to - shell energy transfer across fourier modes might be introduced by the fractal decimation .",
    "the fractal mask can be seen as an extra , ad - hoc removal of non - linear couplings at all scales and , as such , a sort of power - law external `` energy - conserving '' noise . it is not unphysical to suppose that due to the power - law dependence on the wavenumber , a different weight between local and non - local interactions in fourier space is introduced , making the latter more important then in the usual @xmath3 case .",
    "given all this , it is conceivable that an extra decorrelation time of the order of @xmath115 appears , leading to a slow down of the energy transfer mechanisms , as is the case for alfvn waves in mhd  @xcite or in the presence of a rapid distortion mechanism  @xcite . typically , this leads to an estimate for the energy flux @xmath116 , where the transfer time is given in terms of a golden mean between the eddy - turn - over time @xmath117 and the decorrelation time @xmath118 , @xmath119 .",
    "if this is the case , considering that @xmath120 , we arrive at the estimate @xmath121 .",
    "let us notice that other decimation protocols might be imagined .",
    "in particular , one can consider performing a selective decimation of a single class of triads ( e.g. , local or nonlocal ) , in order to probe the main mechanisms leading to the formation of small - scales shocks in the dynamical evolution . in this case decimation",
    "can not be univocally defined in terms of each wavenumber , i.e. one wave number might belong to a local or non - local triads depending on the other two .",
    "hence a selected triads reduction can be done only inside the non linear convolution term , accessible via a fully spectral code with strong limitation in the numerical resolution achievable ; see ref .",
    "+ moreover , a recent study @xcite has shown that highly non - trivial time correlations among fourier triads are connected to the presence of intermittency in physical space .",
    "it is not obvious _ a priori _ that reducing fourier interaction will lead to a time de - synchronization of the energy exchange among triads .",
    "the results of ref . @xcite",
    "together with the ones shown here suggest that the build up of small - scale intermittent fluctuations in physical space ( shocks ) is indeed the outcome of an entangled temporal correlations amongst many ( all ? ) fourier modes .",
    "another interesting potentially useful methodology is to apply proper orthogonal decomposition of fourier amplitudes and phases correlations @xcite .    in this paper , we have presented a set of theoretical and numerical results concerning the evolution of the one - dimensional stochastically forced burgers equation decimated on a fractal fourier set .",
    "decimation leads , very quickly , to a suppression of the shock - dominated statistics , indicating that the bifractal scaling properties of the original equation are very sensitive to the details of the dynamical evolution .",
    "similar results have also been recently obtained for the more complicated case of the dynamics of fully developed incompressible turbulent flows in three dimensional navier - stokes equations .",
    "some properties connected to the existence of shock - like solutions are nevertheless robust , but sub - leading .",
    "our results indicate that the existence of strong localized fluctuations in burgers is the result of highly entangled correlations among _ all _ fourier modes . this might be important to develop models for the nonlinear evolution based on suitable reduction ( and replacement ) of a subset of the original degrees of freedom .",
