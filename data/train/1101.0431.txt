    "in a series of papers , we have begun to develop non - equilibrium thermodynamics starting from the second law and ensuring the additivity of entropy as a state function @xcite . the central idea in this approach",

    "( [ gibbs_fundamental_relation_0 ] ) remains valid , @xmath7 has _ no _ explicit @xmath15-depenedence ; the temporal evolution of the entropy in this case comes from the time - dependence in @xmath13 , with @xmath11and @xmath12 still independent of each other .",

    "the same is also true of the affinity , except that the affinity vector @xmath27 for the medium ; see ii .    from now on , we will only consider the case when the system is in internal equilibrium .",

    "the following maxwell relations that follow from the gibbs fundamental relation , see eq .",

    "the equilibrium field and affinity of the system become equal to those of the medium ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) ; see @xcite .",

    "these extensions will play an important role in non - equilibrium systems that are nonetheless in internal equilibrium .",
    "the time - variation of the internal temperature @xmath45 of a non - equilibrium system such as a glass is due to the time dependence of the observable @xmath35 such as @xmath36 , etc . and of the internal variable @xmath12 .",

    "we will briefly discuss them .",

    "the last section contains a brief summary of our results .",
    "an example of non - equilibrium systems under investigation here is a glass @xcite ; see figs .",
    "[ fig_glasstransition_v ] and [ fig_glasstransition_g ] .",
    "a supercooled liquid l is a _ stationary _ ( time - independent ) metastable state @xcite , which for our purpose , represents an equilibrium state ( by not allowing the crystalline state into consideration ) , and is shown by the curve abf under isobaric condition at a fixed pressure @xmath51 of the medium .",
    "we will refer to the equilibrium liquid always as l in the following .",
    "in contrast , a non - equilibrium liquid state will be designated gl here , and represents a _ time - dependent _ metastable state @xcite .",
    "the choice of gl is to remind us that it is a precursor to the eventual glass gl at a lower temperature .",
    "the equilibrium liquid l is obtained by cooling the liquid l and waiting long enough at each for it to come to equilibrium with the medium . however ,",
    "if it is obtained at a fixed cooling rate @xmath52 , then at some temperature @xmath53 l can not come to equilibrium and turns into gl ; the resulting curve bd leaves abf tangentially at b , and gradually turns into an isobaric glass gl represented by the segment de at d , when the viscosity becomes so large ( @xmath54 poises ) that it appears as a solid . at b ,",
    "the transition is from an equilibrium liquid l to a non - equilibrium liquid form gl , and will be called the l - gl transition . in the literature , it is commonly known as a transition from an ergodic state ( l ) to a non - ergodic state ( gl ) . in our opinion , this is a misnomer , as the concept of _ ergodicity _ refers to the long - time , indeed the infinite - time , behavior . in this limit",
    ", there will be no gl , only l. therefore , we will refer to this transition at @xmath55 as a l - gl transition or a _ precursory _ glass transition .",
    "the true glass transition at d is not a transition from l to gl , but a transition from gl to gl .",
    "we will refer to the glass transition at the lower temperature @xmath56 at d as the _ actual _ glass transition , or simply the glass transition .",
    "the transition region bd represents a time - dependent metastable supercooled liquid ( to be distinguished from the stationary metastable",
    "supercooled liquid l denoted by abf ) , which turns into a glass at d. the expansion coefficient in the glass is almost identical to that of the corresponding crystal below d. the glass continuously emerges out of gl at d , whose location is also determined by the rate @xmath52 of cooling .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath57 of the system ( the supercooled liquid ) becomes equal ( really comparable ) to the observation time @xmath58 at b. as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_glasstransition_v ] , the volume remains continuous at b and d at the two glass transitions .",
    "the same is also true of the entropy .",
    "indeed , the state of the system changes continuously at b and d , which is highly reproducible for a given cooling rate @xmath52 or the observation time @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the points b and d can be taken as a well - defined and unique glass transition temperatures @xmath59 and @xmath56 associated with the point b and d , respectively , in both figures .",
    "both transitions represent a non - equilibrium version of a continuous transition ( see sect .",
    "[ marker_clausius_clapeyron_relation ] for elaboration on this point ) , where not only the gibbs free energy , see fig .",
    "[ fig_glasstransition_g ] , but also its derivatives are continuous .",
    "the non - equilibrium nature of the transition appears in the dependence of the value of @xmath59 and @xmath56 on the rate of cooling .",
    "the continuity of the gibbs free energy at b and d makes them as genuine candidates as ( glass ) transition points , a requirement of a transition in equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "therefore , both these transitions will be collectively called _ conventional transitions _ in this work .",
    "[ ptb ]    glasstransition_v.eps    unfortunately , the idea of a glass transition was formulated as a transition between l and gl .",
    "thus , neither of the above two glass transitions represent the glass transition in the original sense .",
    "as the glass is considered a frozen state , it is common to assume that over the region de , the glass has its internal variables denoted by @xmath41 frozen at its value @xmath60 at d , even though its observables denoted by @xmath42 continue to change .",
    "on the other hand , the internal variables and the observables continue to change over bd from their values at b to their values at d. consequently ,    [ ptb ]    glasstransition_gibbsfreeenergy.eps    the properties such as the volume of gl , which is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig_glasstransition_v ] , gradually change to those of the glass at lower temperatures .",
    "thus , the glass transition from ab  to de is not a sharp transition .",
    "it can be argued , as we have done above , that b and d should be taken as the glass transition points .",
    "however , the practice in the field is to take a point between bd as a transition point obtained by electing some well - defined rule of selection ; see for example @xcite for a good discussion of various ways of identifying the glass transition temperature .",
    "one such rule commonly used is to consider the volume of the system and introduce an _ apparent _ glass transition temperature @xmath61 by the _ equilibrium continuation _ of the volume bcf of ab and by the _ extrapolation _ of the volume dcg of de to find their crossing point c. the state of the glass following tool and narayanaswamy @xcite is then _ customarily _ identified by the point c on dc .",
    "however , there is no reason to take the state at c to represent any real glass , as the extrapolation does not have to satisfy non - equilibrium thermodynamics ; the latter is valid only along the physical path db for the _ given history _ of preparation such as determined by the fixed rate @xmath52 of cooling during vitrification .",
    "the glass at @xmath61 must be described by the point on db corresponding to @xmath61 if we wish to employ non - equilibrium thermodynamics . to be sure",
    ", one can find a slow enough cooling rate than the one used to obtain gl at b so that the point b actually coincides with the point c on abf , as the latter represents l. however , the gl that will emerge at c for the slower cooling rate has nothing to do with the extrapolated state c on dcg . because of the continuity of the state , the gl at the slower rate at c will have its @xmath62 and @xmath63  and will have its gibbs free energy continuous .",
    "moreover , the new gl will follow a curve that will be strictly below bde .",
    "these aspects make the new gl different from the extrapolated gl  at c. taking the point c on cd to represent the glass will be an approximation , which we will avoid in this work , as our interest is to apply thermodynamics in the study of glasses .",
    "therefore , we will use the extrapolation to only determine @xmath61 , but the real glass and the real liquid states are determined by the curve bd and bcf , respectively , where our non - equilibrium thermodynamics should be applicable .",
    "the location of this temperature @xmath61 depends on the property being extrapolated .",
    "we can use the entropy of the system to locate the apparent glass transition temperature , which would invariably give a different value for the apparent glass transition temperature . to call one of these temperatures as a transition temperature is a misnomer for another reason .",
    "none of these temperatures represent a `` non - equilibrium '' thermodynamic transition for the simple reason that the two branches dcg and bcf do not have a common gibbs free energy  at @xmath61 as is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_glasstransition_g ] .",
    "the branch abc@xmath64f represents the gibbs free energy of the equilibrium supercooled liquid , while the segment de represents the gibbs free energy of the glass , with the segment bd denoting the gibbs free energy of the system during the transition region .",
    "the extrapolation dcg in fig .",
    "[ fig_glasstransition_v ] to determine the glass transition temperature @xmath61 corresponds to the extrapolated segment dcg in fig .",
    "[ fig_glasstransition_g ] .",
    "the gibbs free energy of the glass in this extrapolation is given by the point c , while the gibbs free energy of the supercooled liquid is determined by the point c@xmath64 .",
    "evidently , the two free energies are very different , with that of the glass higher than that of the supercooled liquid , as expected from the non - equilibrium nature of the glassy state .    the above discussion of the apparent glass transition also applies to comparing the glass at d with the corresponding l at @xmath56 , which will represent yet another apparent glass transition temperature .",
    "this apparent glass transition has the same problem regarding the gibbs free energy as the previous one at @xmath61 .",
    "however , this transition differs from the apparent glass transition at @xmath61  in that the `` glass '' at @xmath61  is not a frozen state , while the glass at d is a `` frozen '' glass to some extent ( as it also undergoes structural relaxation in time ) .",
    "it should also be remarked that whether we consider the apparent glass transition at @xmath56 or @xmath61 , the transition is an example of a discontinuity in the gibbs free energy of the two states .",
    "this is different from the precursory glass transition and the actual glass transition at b and d , respectively , where the gibbs free energy is continuous .",
    "because of the discontinuity in the gibbs free energies in the apparent glass transitions at @xmath56 and @xmath61 , we will refer to these transitions as _ apparent transitions _ in this work . indeed , one can think of these transitions as an analog of a _ zeroth order _ transition because of the discontinuity in the gibbs free energy",
    "however , it should be remarked that the apparent transitions do not represent any transition in the system ; those transitions are the two conventional transitions discussed above .",
    "the apparent transitions represent our desire to compare two distinct states .",
    "this is like comparing the supercooled liquid with the crystal at the same temperature and pressure .",
    "therefore , a discontinuity in the gibbs free energy is not a violation of the principle of continuity discussed in @xcite",
    ".    we will consider all of the above glass transitions later when we discuss the evaluation of the prigogine - defay ratio @xcite in sect .",
    "[ marker_pd_ratio ] . in this ratio ,",
    "a non - equilibrium state is compared with the equilibrium supercooled liquid state along abf . in the classic approach adopted by simon @xcite , the temperature range @xmath65",
    "is shrunk to a point , either by considering the apparent glass transition at @xmath61 , or by comparing the glass state at d with the supercooled liquid l at b. the latter amounts to neglecting the segment bd from consideration .",
