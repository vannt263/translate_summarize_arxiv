    "<S> the complex - field approach is developed to derive analytical expressions of the magnetic field distributions around superconducting strips on ferromagnetic substrates ( sc / fm strips ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the ferromagnetic substrates as ideal soft magnets with an infinite magnetic permeability , neglecting the ferromagnetic hysteresis . on the basis of the critical state model for a superconducting strip </S>",
    "<S> , the ac susceptibility @xmath0 of a sc / fm strip exposed to a perpendicular ac magnetic field is theoretically investigated , and the results are compared with those for superconducting strips on nonmagnetic substrates ( sc / nm strips ) . </S>",
    "<S> the real part @xmath1 for @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the amplitude of the ac magnetic field , @xmath4 is the critical current density , and @xmath5 is the thickness of the superconducting strip ) of a sc / fm strip is @xmath6 of that of a sc / nm strip . </S>",
    "<S> the imaginary part @xmath7 ( or ac loss @xmath8 ) for @xmath9 of a sc / fm strip is larger than that of a sc / nm strip , even when the ferromagnetic hysteresis is neglected , and this enhancement of @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 ) is due to the edge effect of the ferromagnetic substrate . </S>"
