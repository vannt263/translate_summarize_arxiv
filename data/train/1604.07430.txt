    "<S> in this paper we present scanning tunneling microscopy of a large @xmath0 crystal with superconducting pbbi islands deposited on the surface </S>",
    "<S> . local density of states measurements are consistent with induced superconductivity in the topological surface state with a coherence length of order 540 nm . at energies above the gap </S>",
    "<S> the density of states exhibits oscillations due to scattering caused by a nonuniform order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> strikingly , the spectra taken on islands also display similar oscillations along with traces of the dirac cone , suggesting an inverse topological proximity effect .    * _ introduction_*. three - dimensional topological insulators ( ti ) @xcite , such as @xmath0 , bi@xmath1te@xmath2 or bi@xmath3sb@xmath4 , were once only known for having great thermoelectric properties . </S>",
    "<S> their most notable physical characteristic , to harbor gapless surface states with striking spin textures protected by topology , was discovered only recently @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is understood nowadays that these topological surface states ( tss ) stem from a combination of strong spin - orbit coupling and band inversion in these materials . </S>",
    "<S> it has been quickly realized that studying the interplay of such symmetry - protected states and symmetry - broken phases , including for example magnetism or superconductivity , may lead to a plethora of new effects and provide new platforms for potential technological advances . </S>",
    "<S> the most natural approach to achieve this goal is to study a set of phenomena associated with the proximity effect .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been predicted that when a topological insulator is brought into contact with a conventional @xmath5-wave superconductor ( sc ) the proximity effect induces superconducting correlations into the tss that have unconventional @xmath6-wave symmetry @xcite . this original result triggered a flood of further theoretical works , some representative examples include refs .  , and a multitude of experimental efforts . </S>",
    "<S> the latter span from angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy , scanning tunneling microscopy , point contact , and differential conductance measurements @xcite , through to observations of supercurrents and unusual josephson fraunhofer patterns @xcite ; experiments on phase coherent transport including multiple andreev reflections , fabry - perot interferometry and aharonov - bohm oscillations @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> , at an interface as a function of position @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the superconducting condensate amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the pairing interaction constant , @xmath9 , is generally taken to have the form of a clear step function , but at small scales , the step actually has a finite slope due to electronic screening @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) a schematic illustration for the geometry of the stm probe scanning over the surface of ti @xmath0 in proximity to a pbbi island . in this experiment , we are interested in measuring the superconducting coherence length in the plane parallel to the ti surface , not in the normal direction to the surface as done in many other experiments . ]    on the technical side , proximity effects can be realized by growing thin layers of sc - ti heterostructures , an approach employed by most of the existing experiments . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one could study induced superconductivity in the surface state from the ti s bulk which becomes superconducting by cu - intercalation into bi@xmath1se@xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while cu@xmath4bi@xmath1se@xmath2 retains the dirac surface state , its superconducting volume fraction is relatively low which causes obvious challenges . here </S>",
    "<S> we explore a complimentary but different route inducing superconductivity into tss locally by depositing a matrix of superconducting pbbi islands on the surface of bi@xmath1se@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this approach was theorized earlier as a path to creating superconducting graphene @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was employed experimentally to create a tunable realization of two - dimensional superconductivity in mesoscopic superconductor - normal - superconductor arrays @xcite .    through the use of cryogenic scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) , an experimental technique that is ideal for probing the superconducting proximity effect in inhomogeneous samples , we are able to measure the induced local electronic density of states in ti surface states . a schematic illustration of the experiment is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure1](b ) , where an stm probe is placed near the interface of a superconducting island and a ti , and spectra are taken while gradually moving the probe away from the island along the ti surface .    </S>",
    "<S> we report in this letter the observation of two main experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> first , we show that stm spectra reveal a clear superconducting gap induced into the tss . from the spatially resolved probes and fits of the gap function we estimate the superconducting coherence length to be of the order of @xmath10 along the direction parallel to the quintuple layers . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , at energies above the gap we observe oscillatory behavior of the density of states that resembles the tomasch interference effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , while all the existing efforts were concentrated on revealing signatures of superconductivity induced into the tss , much less attention was paid to the corresponding reverse effect of the tss on an adjacent superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> we address this intriguing question by taking careful stm density of states spectra on superconducting islands and uncovering traces of the dirac cone that seemingly leaks from the tss . </S>",
    "<S> this observation manifestly provides evidence for the possibility of an inverse topological proximity effect .        </S>",
    "<S> * _ measurements and results_*. the ti used in this experiment is bismuth doped @xmath11 , grown by slowly cooling a stoichiometric mixture of bi and se from a temperature of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> five atomic planes with atomic order se1-bi1-se2-bi1-se1 form a quintuple layer ( ql ) ; the qls are weakly bound to each other , making it possible to readily expose a pristine surface for study . </S>",
    "<S> the exposed ql supports the existence of the tss , which features a single dirac cone . </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath13 is typically @xmath14 type , the bulk doping of bi tends to shift the fermi level back to the center of the band gap @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 is used as the superconductor due to its favorable whetting properties on @xmath13 , its large gap width ( 3.65 mev ) , and its high transition temperature of 8.2 k @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the ti is first cleaved in a nitrogen environment then placed into a thermal evaporator . here , we deposit 10 nm of @xmath15 onto the surface of the ti by evaporation through a ( transmission electron microscopy ) tem mask . </S>",
    "<S> this results in large array of superconducting islands with a diameter of 1.2 @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> from there , the sample is moved to our cryogenic besocke design stm system for measurement . </S>",
    "<S> all of these steps are taken in a vacuum , nitrogen , or helium environment , so the sample is never exposed to air . </S>",
    "<S> all stm topographs are taken with a bias voltage of 5 v and tunneling current of 500 pa , and all spectra are taken over a range of -45 mev to 45 mev and measured via a lock - in amplifier .    </S>",
    "<S> when doing a surface probe measurement , it is important to fully characterize the surface being measured . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , we are interested in the quality of deposition of the pbbi islands as well as how clean the interface is between the island edge and the ti surface . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure2 ] , we show various atomic force microscopy ( afm ) and stm topographs demonstrating the structure of these islands after thermal evaporation , we want to stress that these samples were also not exposed to the air . </S>",
    "<S> the pbbi dots appear to be comprised of many 20 - 100 nm radius droplets grown on top of and around one another . </S>",
    "<S> this can clearly be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure2](a ) and ( b ) . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure2](c ) is an stm topograph showing the edge of one of such droplet formations , along with the respective height profile in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure2](d ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we can see that the interface between the pbbi and the ti surface is very abrupt , giving evidence of minimal leakage of the pbbi onto the ti surface .    </S>",
    "<S> we present the local density of states ( ldos ) measurements taken via cryogenic stm at a temperature of 4.2k in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the right panel shows a series of differential conductance plots reflecting ldos of tss taken at various distances away from the superconducting island . at a distance of approximately 40 nm </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting induced gap is roughly 20% smaller than the corresponding gap on an island , while at distance of order 200 nm the gap falls to almost half of its value . at a distance of @xmath17 @xmath18 , </S>",
    "<S> the dirac cone is the only dominating feature in the ldos since the local region of the ti is no longer within the range of the superconducting proximity effect.on the data set taken at 40 nm away from the island one sees oscillatory features occurring with the period of 5 - 10 mv . as seen in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , the magnitude of the fourier transform shows a clear resonance at 0.11 @xmath19 , corresponding to a periodicity of 9 mv ; a near harmonic is evident at 0.20 @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , similar features are present on the ldos plots taken on the different islands , which are shown on the left panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in addition to oscillations at energies above the gap , traces of the dirac cone are also revealed . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this dependence to the inverse topological proximity effect where ldos properties of topological surface states penetrate into the superconducting island . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate this behavior by a simple theoretical model .     </S>",
    "<S> curves measured at 4.2 k taken at various distances from a pbbi island . </S>",
    "<S> the ldos displays clear signature of the induced superconducting gap . </S>",
    "<S> another notable feature of the presented data is visible oscillations , the frequency of oscillations is visible in the fourier transforms shown in the inset . </S>",
    "<S> the left panel represents @xmath20 curves measured on different islands at nominally the same conditions . above the gap </S>",
    "<S> one can see not only oscillations but also traces of the dirac cone at higher energies . </S>",
    "<S> all data are normalized so that @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry which can be seen in the top left two panels is due to an offset between the fermi energy and the minimum of the dirac cone caused by the states leaking onto the superconducting island . ]    * _ discussion and analysis_*. it has been emphasized early on that crystals of bi@xmath1se@xmath2 possess topological surface states , as well as intra - gap trivial states in the bulk originating from unintentional doping , and importantly also at the surface due to the band bending effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this coexistence of topological and trivial surface states leads to certain complications in the context of the proximity effect . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , phase coherent transport measurements @xcite suggest that the superconducting proximity effect of trivial states is in the diffusion dominated transport regime , whereas topological states display transport peculiarities that are specific to the ballistic domain of transport .    in order to gain some theoretical insight into the system we have modeled our experimental set - up in two limits . as a first approach we have considered the diffusive limit that should be relevant to a part of the proximity effect governed by the trivial surface states . in complete analogy to previously studied mesoscopic superconductor - normal proximity junctions @xcite we solved the standard usadel equation for a circular geometry describing a superconducting island of radius @xmath22 surrounded by an infinite normal system . within this formalism </S>",
    "<S> the proximity effect is described by the semiclassical green s function @xmath23 $ ] of position and energy that in the normal region obeys the nonlinear equation @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the dimensionless position coordinate and @xmath26 is the thouless energy defined by the fermi momentum @xmath27 and mean free path @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the ldos is obtained from the real part of the green s function @xmath29,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the normal density of states without the proximity effect . in a linearized regime , </S>",
    "<S> applicable at distances away from the boundary where the proximity effect is weak , an analytical result for eq .   </S>",
    "<S> is possible , @xmath31 elsewhere the problem must be solved numerically . in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32 is the modified bessel function and @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the bcs density of states on the island . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis predicts a reasonable @xmath5-wave like proximity induced gap @xmath35 in the normal region , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure4](a ) , albeit with a scale set by the thouless energy , @xmath36 , rather than a superconducting gap @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> however it contains no specific information about the microscopic surface state structure of the material , which is neglected in the semiclassical disordered limit . for the typical </S>",
    "<S> known values of @xmath38 m / s and @xmath39 nm which are specific to bi@xmath1se@xmath2 surface states , and @xmath40 nm , one estimates a proximity induced thouless gap @xmath41 mev to be in a proper parameter regime when compared with @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> based on this modeling the expected superconducting coherence length for disordered surface states is in the range of @xmath42 nm . </S>",
    "<S> however , in order to fit the actual spatial profile of the decay of the gap function @xmath43 in the bi@xmath1se@xmath2 found in the experiment [ see inset in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure4](b ) ] it is necessary to use a fitting parameter of the thouless scale which is different from what is estimated above . </S>",
