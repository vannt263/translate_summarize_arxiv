    "the subject of open quantum systems has undergone substantial growth in the last three decades , starting with contributions to the field of fundamental quantum physics with the aim of understanding the process of decoherence . based on the von neumann approach to the reduction of the state vector @xcite",
    ", these contributions were mainly driven by the pioneering work of zurek @xcite , caldeira and leggett @xcite , and joos and zeh @xcite .",
    "the repercussions of their work , together with the advent of the field of quantum information theory , led to renewed interest in open quantum systems , the focus now shifting from fundamental issues to practical applications in circuits to implement quantum logic operations .    the master equation approach has long been used to derive system - reservoir dynamics , to account for energy loss under a weak coupling regime @xcite .",
    "its effectiveness comes from the fact that the energy loss of most quantum mechanical systems , especially within quantum and atomic optics , can be handled by the single - pole wigner - weisskopf approximation @xcite , where a perturbative expansion is performed in the system - reservoir coupling . following developments by caldeira and leggett @xcite , more sophisticated methods to deal with the system - reservoir strong coupling regime have been advanced , such as the hu - paz - zhang @xcite master equation , with time - dependent coefficients , which allows for non - markovian dynamics .",
    "halliwell and yu @xcite have published an alternative derivation of the hu - paz - zhang equation , in which the dynamics is represented by the wigner function , and an exact solution of this equation was given by ford and oconnell @xcite .",
    "recently , the non - markovian dynamics of open quantum systems has been studied with renewed interest , especially in connection with quantum information theory , as in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , in these studies , as well as in most of the derivations of master equations with time - dependent coefficients , the authors assume either the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) or the secular approximation ( sa ) for the system - reservoir coupling @xcite . since non - markovian behavior is sensitive to the counter - rotating terms in the interaction hamiltonian , important features of the dynamics are missing under the rwa in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a study of the effect of the rwa and the sa on the non - markovian behavior in the spin - boson model at zero temperature has already been advanced @xcite , without , however , deriving a master equation .",
    "our goal in this work is to derive and investigate the consequences of a master equation within the strong - coupling regime , which prevents us resorting to either the rwa or the sa in the system - reservoir coupling .",
    "moreover , instead of the path integrals approach @xcite , we use the formalism of quasi - probability distributions , thus enabling us to cast the problem as the solution of a linear system of equations .",
    "our results follow from the general treatment of a bosonic dissipative network we have previously presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the network dynamics were investigated , and further used for quantum information purposes @xcite .",
    "however , differently from our previous developments , we first consider the general model for a network of bosonic non - dissipative oscillators and , subsequently , we focus on some of these oscillators ( or in just one of them ) as our system of interest , and treat all the others as a ( structured ) reservoir . the exact dynamics of the network allows us to obtain an exact dynamics of the system - reservoir interaction .",
    "moreover , we present a simple inequality to distinguish between markovian and non - markovian dynamics .    finally , this development enables us to generalize an earlier result by glauber @xcite .",
    "when using the rwa and a zero - temperature reservoir , it was shown that the quasi - probability functions maintain their shape while they are displaced in phase space ; in particular , coherent states remain coherent states .",
    "we find that , for a general gaussian state , the center of its phase space distribution follows classical dynamics ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but its shape is changed .",
    "furthermore , this change can be derived from the evolution of the vacuum state , which is no longer stationary , because of the counter - rotating terms .",
    "the change in shape is affected by both quantum and thermal fluctuations , and these contributions can be distinguished , at least in theory .",
    "our developments can be straightforwardly translated to the derivation of an exact master equation for fermionic systems , using the reasoning in ref .",
    "the universe considered here consists of a set of @xmath0 harmonic oscillators , which are linearly coupled to each other in an arbitrary network .",
    "we consider @xmath1 of them to be part of our system of interest , and the remaining @xmath2 to be part of a reservoir .",
    "however , at this stage , we are concerned with the full dynamics of the universe , and there is actually no difference between system and reservoir modes .",
    "the oscillators are described by mass @xmath3 and natural , isolated frequencies @xmath4 ; the coupling between modes @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which occurs via their position coordinates , has strength @xmath7 ( which , without loss of generality , is symmetric in its indices ) . before we write the hamiltonian that describes such a universe",
    ", we note that it must be positive - definite , in order to be bounded from below and have a well - defined ground state .",
    "then , the hamiltonian which is compatible with this model is @xmath8 where the coefficients @xmath7 form a real , symmetric matrix .",
    "we do not assume any particular form for them , so as to generate an arbitrary network , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] the coupling term induces a change in the natural frequency of each mode , that is now represented by @xmath9    fig1.eps    [ fig : fig1 ]    using this renormalized frequency , we can define annihilation operators @xmath10 and rewrite the hamiltonian as @xmath11 the coupling in this picture being given by @xmath12    from here on , we will focus on @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the latter forming a real , symmetric matrix .",
    "the dynamics given by the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltona ] ) is best understood in terms of the characteristic function of a state , which is just the expected value of the multimode displacement operator in the symmetric ordering , @xmath15 where @xmath16 represents all coordinates @xmath17 with @xmath18 , as well as their complex conjugates .",
    "the characteristic function carries the complete information about the state , and in particular information about moments of all orders ; this is one of the reasons it is a better approach than using the heisenberg equations of motion directly .",
    "the von neumann equation in hilbert space is mapped to a differential equation in dual phase space ( where the characteristic function is defined):@xmath19    being linear and of first order , this equation admits a simple ansatz , @xmath20 which implies that the characteristic function maintains its shape , but the underlying ( dual ) phase space undergoes a linear transformation , given by @xmath21 this transformation is defined by the solution to a system of differential equations ,    @xmath22    the heisenberg equations of motion for the first moments have a similar structure .",
    "however , since they refer only to first moments , they do not represent a complete solution of the problem , which can be obtained from the characteristic function with the same computational effort .",
    "from this point on , we shall be interested only in the behavior of a subset of @xmath1 oscillators ( the ones labeled @xmath23 to @xmath1 ) , which form our system of interest , while the oscillators labeled @xmath24 to @xmath0 play the role of a ( structured ) reservoir .",
    "the complete solution to the dynamics is given by eq.([eq : ansatz ] ) ; in order to eliminate the reservoir degrees of freedom , all we need to do is set @xmath25 if @xmath26 ( i.e. , evaluate the characteristic function at the origin of the phase space of the modes we want to eliminate from the description ) . before continuing , we observe that although not strictly necessary in our method , for the sake of simplicity we assume the usual sudden - coupling hypothesis , i.e. , that the states of system and reservoir are initially uncorrelated :    @xmath27    tracing out the reservoir degrees of freedom , following the procedure above , leads to @xmath28 where the indices run only through the degrees of freedom of the system ( i.e. , @xmath5 runs from @xmath23 to @xmath1 ) .",
    "therefore , we must use eq.([eq : linear ] ) with @xmath25 for @xmath26 , and it follows that we only need @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 . eqs .",
    "( [ s1],[s2 ] ) , although written as a matrix equation , are actually a set of @xmath2 independent vector equations and we conclude that only a few of these need to be solved . in fact , if our system of interest were a single oscillator , we would reduce the problem of finding its exact dynamics to a single vector equation of dimension @xmath32 .",
    "the two terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : reducedsolution ] ) are called the homogeneous ( because it depends on the initial state of the system ) and inhomogeneous terms ( because it is independent of it , depending only on the initial state of the reservoir ) .",
    "the homogeneous part of the solution is just the linear transformation of phase space induced only by the elements @xmath29 and @xmath30 for which both @xmath33 . these elements can be arranged in two general complex @xmath34 matrices , resulting in @xmath35 real parameters .    at this point",
    ", we make an additional assumption that the initial state of the reservoir is gaussian @xcite , i.e. , its characteristic function has the gaussian form .",
    "moreover , the reservoir is unbiased ( i.e. , @xmath36 for @xmath37 ) .",
    "these are reasonable hypotheses , since the gaussian states include the thermal states of quadratic hamiltonians .",
    "the inhomogeneous characteristic function is then also a gaussian function : @xmath38 the time - dependent functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 may be divided into two terms , in the form @xmath41 ( and similarly for @xmath42 ) , the first of which is the solution for a zero - temperature reservoir ,    [ eq : pqzero]@xmath43 while the second incorporates the effects of the reservoir initial state , which is completely characterized by the second - order moments @xmath44 and @xmath45 ,    [ eq : pqtemp]@xmath46 both @xmath47 and @xmath42 form complex @xmath34 matrices ; however , @xmath47 must be hermitian , while @xmath42 is not .",
    "this represents an additional @xmath48 real parameters , giving a total of @xmath49 that completely specifies a given gaussian evolution map ( so called because , if the initial state of the system is gaussian , it will remain gaussian ) .    the functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 represent the solution for a zero - temperature reservoir",
    "; therefore , they represent the quantum , or zero - point fluctuations . the functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 represent the thermal fluctuations ( when the reservoir is assumed to be in a thermal state ) , and other effects that may arise due to , e.g. , squeezing in the reservoir modes .",
    "the above result may be written in a simpler fashion for the case of a single oscillator taken as the system of interest :    @xmath54    where the indices @xmath55 are dropped .",
    "the single - mode gaussian map is completely characterized by @xmath56 real parameters ( since @xmath47 is real , and @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath42 are complex ) .    when a single mode is considered as the system of interest",
    ", we can perform a diagonalization of the reservoir part of the hamiltonian , and consider the interaction of the system with each of the reservoir normal modes , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ( normal modes of the reservoir do not interact with each other , but interact with the system ) .",
    "fig2.eps    in order to get physical results in the limit @xmath59 , it is essential to keep track of the oscillator masses ( @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonqp ] ) ) .",
    "essentially , the central oscillator must be much more massive than the reservoir modes .",
    "this is the case with brownian motion , where the observed particle , though mesoscopic , is still much larger than the bath of fluid molecules it interacts with .",
    "it is also the case in quantum optics , where the mode inside a cavity has a much smaller mode volume ( i.e. , it is concentrated in a small region ) than the vacuum modes outside the cavity .",
    "we shall consider then that the central oscillator has mass @xmath1 and the reservoir modes have mass @xmath60 , with @xmath61 , and the renormalized frequencies and couplings are    @xmath62    dropping the first index , eqs.([s1],[s2 ] ) become    @xmath63    the bottom two equations can be solved by considering @xmath64 and @xmath65 as external parameters .",
    "then , by substituting them into the top two equations , we get a pair of coupled integro - differential equations :    @xmath66    which depends on the reservoir topology only through the function    @xmath67    which in turn is related to the fourier transform of the reservoir spectral density @xmath68    this is the homogeneous part of the solution . to obtain the inhomogeneous one , we need to use the solution found previously for @xmath69 and @xmath70 in terms of the now known @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and then use eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pqzero ] ) and ( [ eq : pqtemp ] ) .",
    "the complete solution for single - mode dynamics is eq .",
    "( [ eq : solution ] ) , with time - dependent functions @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath47 and @xmath42 .",
    "it was derived by assuming an explicit microscopic model for the reservoir as a set of other modes , which are coupled to the mode of interest , but over which the experimenter has little control ( except for macroscopic parameters such as temperature ) . in this section ,",
    "our goal is to find a dynamical equation ( in fact , a master equation ) whose solution is precisely eq .",

    "( [ eq : masterham ] ) is a squeezing term , arising from an asymmetry between position and momentum variables in the coupling hamiltonian .",
    "however , in the weak - coupling regime , this term is small ( being exactly zero in the rwa ) , leading to a negligible squeezing effect .",
    "* @xmath89 is a decay rate , that drives the center of the system wave - packet towards its equilibrium at the origin of phase space .",
    "* @xmath82 is a diffusion coefficient , related to injection of extra noise into the system due to non - zero reservoir temperature and counter - rotating terms , which only spreads the wave - packet without affecting the trajectory of its center .",
    "* @xmath90 is a coefficient of anomalous diffusion , which injects different levels of noise in position and momentum . from eqs .",
    "( [ 1],[2 ] ) , we see that , when @xmath91 , the lindblad operators are not given by @xmath92 and @xmath93 , but by linear combinations of the two , giving rise to anomalous diffusion .      an interesting discussion in the current literature ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) concerns non - markovian behavior .",
    "the born - markov approximation always leads to a lindblad equation with a dissipator written in the form of eq.([eq : masterdisslind ] ) , with rates @xmath94 , which are positive but may vary in time ( in which case it can be called a _ time - dependent markovian process _ ) .",
    "if , at any given time , one of these rates assumes a negative value , then it is said to be a _ non - markovian process _ , according to the divisibility criterion of rivas - huelga - plenio @xcite .",
    "the model we have developed allows us to compute these rates exactly from the solution , obtained through the system - reservoir interaction hamiltonian .",
    "we can thus describe the system as _ markovian _ if the following conditions hold for all times @xmath95 :    @xmath96    where the functions are defined in eq . ( [ eq : gammafrommapa ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma2 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta ] ) .",
    "in many physical systems described by the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltona ] ) , the typical coupling intensity , @xmath97 , is many orders of magnitude smaller than the frequencies @xmath13 , characterizing the _ weak coupling regime_. it is then a good approximation to drop the counter - rotating terms ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) , a procedure which is known as the _ rotating wave approximation _ ( _ rwa _ ) .",

    "together , this implies that @xmath108 . the condition @xmath109 is required to maintain the symmetry between position and momentum variables ( the exchange @xmath110 leaves the rwa hamiltonian unchanged , while it changes the one in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonqp ] ) ) . therefore , in rwa , the squeezing term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : masterham ] ) and the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : masterdiss ] ) both vanish at all times , leading to the usual three terms ( frequency shift , dissipation and diffusion ) in the expression .",
    "the markovianity condition is then simplified to    @xmath111",
    "it is a well known result @xcite that a coherent state remains coherent when in contact with a reservoir at absolute zero , if one assumes rwa .",
    "this makes coherent states a natural basis to analyze system dynamics , ultimately motivating glauber and sudarshan to define the normal - order quasi - probability @xmath112 function :    @xmath113    we have returned to the general case , where the system is composed of @xmath1 modes .",
    "the coherent state follows a dynamics in phase space that can be written @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is given by ( compare with eq .",
    "( [ eq : linear ] ) ) @xmath116 combining these two equations , we have the familiar result @xmath117    the fact that coherent states remain coherent is intimately connected with the fact that the vacuum is a stationary state of this non - unitary evolution . however , for non - zero temperature , or when one includes the counter - rotating terms , this is no longer true : coherent states do not maintain their coherence , and we must resort to another basis , formed by gaussian states . in the same way that the coherent states are generated by displacing the vacuum ,",
    "the time - dependent gaussian basis states are generated by displacing a squeezed thermal state : @xmath118 where @xmath119 is obtained by allowing an initial vacuum state to evolve in accordance with the solution presented in eq .",
    "( [ eq : solution ] ) : @xmath120    adopting then this natural gaussian basis , we can write the evolution of any initial state as : @xmath121    combining eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolvacuum ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolany ] ) , we can rewrite the evolution of an arbitrary initial state ( albeit one with a reasonably well - defined @xmath112 function ) as @xmath122 where @xmath115 describe the evolution of the _ center _ of the wavepacket ( which obeys a classical equation of motion , as required by the ehrenfest theorem , and is independent of the state of the reservoir ) and @xmath123 describe the evolution of the _ shape _ of the wavepacket .    when the rwa and an absolute - zero reservoir are assumed , the wavepacket is not distorted , and @xmath123 reduces to a delta function at the origin , making eq . ( [ eq : naturalbasis ] ) identical to eq .",
    "( [ eq : glauberevolution ] ) . therefore , eq . ( [ eq : naturalbasis ] ) is a generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : glauberevolution ] ) and we have obtained a generalization of the dynamics described in ref . @xcite .",
    "another way to look at this result is that the displaced phase - space quasi - probability function is convoluted with another function , which accounts for the change in shape .",

    "( [ eq : u1integro ] ) and ( [ eq : v1integro ] ) .",

    "we have presented a technique to derive an exact master equation for the system - reservoir dynamics under the strong coupling regime , where neither the rotating - wave - approximation nor the secular approximation apply . to this end , we adopted the strategy of considering a network of bosonic systems coupled to each other , picking out one of them as the system of interest and leaving the rest to play the role of the reservoir . working with phase - space distribution functions and gaussian states ,",
    "we generalize an earlier result by glauber , that a coherent state remains coherent despite dissipation when coupled to a zero temperature reservoir .",
    "we demonstrate that there is a class of gaussian states which serves as a generalization of the coherent state basis of the glauber - sudarshan @xmath112 representation .",
