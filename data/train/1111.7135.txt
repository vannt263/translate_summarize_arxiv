    "the precise description of weak chaos in nonintegrable high - dimensional hamiltonian system is not trivial .",
    "when starting from an integrable system , the large amount of regular structures ( invariant tori in two dimensions ) which remain for small nonlinear perturbations strongly influences the dynamics @xcite .",
    "the phase space dynamics is mainly regular with few chaotic trajectories . in distinction to what happens in totally chaotic or ergodic systems , the dynamics is now strongly dependent , in a very complex way , on the initial conditions ( ics ) .",
    "the present contribution shows a simple and clarifying way to analyze the whole dynamics when weak chaos is dominant .",
    "the dynamics dependence on initial conditions is shown in the plot : ics _ versus _ the nonlinear parameter .",
    "chaotic trajectories are generated inside intervals of ics which get larger as the nonlinear parameter increases , forming chaotic `` stripes''-like structures in the plot ics _ versus _ nonlinear parameter .",
    "thus the purpose of the present work is to show the way ( _ via _ chaotic stripes ) integrable hamiltonian systems are transformed in weakly chaotic systems .",
    "since chaotic stripes are expected to exist for a large class of hamiltonian systems , results are shown here for two entirely different systems .",
    "the first system is the two dimensional open rectangular billiard where the corners have been modified , they are rounded .",
    "such open billiard , but with straight corners and a rounded open channel , was studied recently @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the rounded open channel generates a chaotic dynamics inside the stripes and thus inside the billiard .",
    "the chaotic motion is characterized based on exponential decays of escape times ( ets ) statistics @xcite inside the stripes .",
    "we would like to mention some examples of two - dimensional billiards where boundaries have been modified : edge roughness in quantum dots @xcite , soft billiards @xcite , edge corrections @xcite in a resonator , effects of soft walls @xcite , rounded edges @xcite , deformation of dielectric cavities @xcite , location of the hole @xcite , among others .",
    "the second example considered here comes from the nonlinear dynamics , namely @xmath0 particles which are globally coupled on a discrete lattice .",
    "this system was extensively studied in @xcite , and the dynamics characterized by the existence of an ordering process called clustering . in the context of the present work , this model serves to show that chaotic stripes exist in a higher - dimensional system and are related to the arnold web , or stochastic web @xcite .",
    "different from the billiard case , the chaotic motion will be characterized by the finite time lyapunov exponent ( ftle ) .",
    "starting from a chaotic trajectory , regular structures induce sticky motion @xcite , the convergence of the ftles is affected and the dynamics becomes strongly dependent on ics .",
    "recent methods @xcite , which use higher - order cummulants of gaussian - like distributions of the ftles to characterize the whole dynamics via sticky motion , do not work quite well for very small nonlinear perturbations since the distributions may be multimodal @xcite .",
    "although we are considering two totally distinct physical systems , the common feature is that the appearance of chaotic trajectories for weak perturbations occurs _ via _ the same process , the chaotic stripes . in other words we are interested to understand how the transition from integrable motion to weakly chaotic regime happens as the parameter of nonlinearity",
    "is increased .",
    "this occurs for the very simple billiard system and for the complex coupled maps , for which chaotic stripes are shown to be related to the arnold web .",
    "since the second model contains coupled standard maps , results should be valid for a large class of dynamical systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ model ] presents the model of the open billiard system and shows numerical results for the ets decays and the existence of stripes in emission angles .",
    "section  [ maps ] presents the coupled map lattice model , shows the existence of the stripes and their relation to the arnold web . in section  [ conclusions ]",

    "the closed rectangular billiard is integrable in the absence of corner effects ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "all lyapunov exponents are zero and the dynamics can be described in terms of invariant tori .",

    "when opening up the billiard , ics which start on an irrational torus will certainly escape the billiard after some time , but trajectories which start exactly on a rational tori will never leave the billiard , except for those ics which match the opening channel .     and ( b ) @xmath17 ( one ic ) : green ( light gray ) points occur when the trajectory collides with the rounded corner and defines the scattering region ( sr ) or chaotic region .",

[ time](c ) , a straight line decay is observed , characterizing the transition to an almost totally chaotic motion when stripes overlap .    summarizing results for the billiard model , we showed that specific intervals of ics , called chaotic stripes , which increase linearly with the nonlinear parameter , generate chaotic trajectories .",
    "outside these stripes we have the isoemissions stripes , for which the ics generate a regular motion . for smaller values of the parameter",

    "such regular structures can be global invariants ( as @xmath84 ) or local , or collective ordered states which live in the high - dimensional phase space . as trajectories itinerate between ordered and random states , the regular structures affect locally the ftles inducing sticky motion , so that the corresponding ftles decrease . thus each point in the mixed plot from fig .",

    "this picture is similar to the one shown in @xcite ( but in black and white ) , and presents a form called as `` onion '' .",
    "in fact , this plot shows an arnold web , or stochastic web , where points with larger ftles are the chaotic channels inside which the arnold diffusion occurs .",

    "we can define the chaotic stripes as _",
    "arnold stripes_. we also observed such stripes for hamiltonian systems with higher values of @xmath88 and other couplings ( not shown here ) .",
    "this suggests that weak chaos in hamiltonian systems always emerges inside stripes of particular ics .",
    "this is of relevance since in such systems finite time distributions , independently of the considered physical quantity , are not gaussians anymore and decay rates of recurrences and time correlations are difficult to obtain @xcite . for higher values of the nonlinear parameters a totally chaotic motion is observed due to the overlap of arnold stripes ."
