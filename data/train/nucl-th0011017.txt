    "<S> the chemical composition of the neutron star is determined by the requirement of charge neutrality and equilibrium with respect to the weak interaction ( @xmath29-stable matter ) . from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) we can calculate the proton fraction , @xmath30 , for @xmath29-stable matter as found in the interior of neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> equilibrium for the reactions @xmath31 and @xmath32 requires that @xmath33 where @xmath34 ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) is the chemical potential . </S>",

    "<S> ( 1 ) , ( 3)-(5 ) , it is easy to find numerically the proton fraction as a function of density @xmath10 .    just above nuclear matter density at which @xmath43 exceeds the muon mass @xmath44 , </S>",
    "<S> the reactions @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 may be energetically allowed such that both electrons and muons are present in @xmath29-stable matter . </S>",
    "<S> this alters the @xmath29-stability condition to @xmath48 ^{1/2},\\ ] ] with @xmath49    the bulk properties of symmetry nuclear matter at saturation density , such as the density @xmath50 , the binding energy per nucleon @xmath51 , the incompressibility @xmath52 , the effective mass @xmath53 , and the symmetry energy are summarized in table 1 for the three parameter sets sii , siii , and ski5 . from table 1 , one can see that the difference for incompressibility between sii and ski5 is very large , about 85 mev at saturation density , while they almost have the same @xmath53=0.58 . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the difference for @xmath53 is very large between siii and sii , about 0.18 at saturation density , while the difference for incompressibility between them is relatively small , about 14 mev . in calculations </S>",
    "<S> , we note that the binding energy per nucleon @xmath54 and the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath28 exhibit completely different behaviors with the increase of the baryon density for different skyrme parameter sets . </S>",
    "<S> these differences come from the difference of the nuclear eoss . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one may investigate the proton fraction for different nuclear eoss .    under the parabolic approximation ( up to the -@xmath55 term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) ) , the chemical compositions of neutron stars in both the electrons only and electrons plus muons cases as a function of the baryon density are shown in figs . 1 ( a)-1 ( c ) using the skyrme parameter sets sii , siii , and ski5 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in order to ensure validity of the proton fraction above , we show the squared ratio of sound speed to light speed , ( @xmath56)@xmath57 ( where @xmath58 is the total energy density ) , in fig . 1 ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the causality condition requires ( @xmath56)@xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> one notes that for sii and ski5 , the squared ratio ( @xmath56)@xmath2 will make the causality condition fail to be satisfied at baryon density larger than 1.35 @xmath60 and 1.1 @xmath61 , respectively , about 8 times larger than the saturation density for symmetry nuclear matter . for siii , </S>",
    "<S> up to baryon density 1.5 @xmath60 , the causality condition can be still satisfied . from figs . 1 ( a)-1 ( c ) </S>",
    "<S> , one can find that the addition of muons increases significantly the proton fraction over a broad range of density . in case of siii , </S>",
    "<S> the muon fraction is very small and muons only exist at about 0.16 @xmath60 , which is due to the fact that @xmath43 is too small to exceed the muon mass @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the proton fraction is an important ingredient to model the thermal evolution of a neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , if the proton fraction in the interior of star is above a critical value @xmath62 , the so - called direct urca processes @xmath31 and @xmath32 can occur@xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> if they occur , neutrino emission and neutron star cooling rate are increased by a large factor compared to the standard cooling scenario@xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the critical proton fraction has been estimated to be in the range of @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> it is indicated from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 that the proton fraction for sii and siii can not reach this range . however , the proton fraction reaches @xmath65 at baryon density 0.2 fm @xmath66 for ski5 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that one can get a reasonable proton fraction for a softer nuclear eos , such as @xmath67 mev for case of ski5 . while for stiffer ones , such as sii ( @xmath68 mev ) and siii ( @xmath69 mev ) , one might not get reasonable proton fraction although they may have a very different effective mass ( @xmath70 0.580 and 0.763 for sii and siii , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> it seems that the incompressibility is more important to determine the proton fraction .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the interesting features of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 is the disappearance of the proton fraction at high density , namely , @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xmath60 for sii and siii , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon may be due primarily to the greater short - range repulsion in isospin singlet nucleon pairs compared to isospin triplet nucleon pairs@xmath73 . at high density </S>",
    "<S> this short - range repulsion must dominate and pure neutron matter is favored . at intermediate densities the strong isospin singlet tensor potential and correlation serve to keep the isospin singlet nucleon pairs , and thus symmetry nuclear matter , more attractive than pure neutron matter . </S>",
    "<S> these features imply that the pure neutron matter may exist in the interior of neutron stars where the density is high enough . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon has also been observed in the calculations of the vmb theory . </S>",
    "<S> for parameter set ski5 , the disappearance of the proton fraction is not found up to 1.5 @xmath60 .    </S>",
    "<S> many theoretical studies have shown that the empirical parabolic law of the single particle binding energy is well satisfied within a broad range of density and neutron excess @xmath24 , namely , in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) the @xmath55 term is significant , but the higher - order terms are very small . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is still unknown how the higher - order terms affect the proton fraction at high density . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 is the same as fig . 1 except for including all the higher - order terms . </S>",
    "<S> from the comparison between figs . 1 and 2 , one can find that the addition of the high - order terms increases significantly the fraction of different constituents , @xmath36 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , over a broad range of density for parameter sets sii and siii . </S>",
    "<S> it implies that the higher - order terms of the nuclear symmetry energy have obvious effects on the chemical composition and the parabolic approximation of the nuclear symmetry energy may result in large deviation .    </S>",
