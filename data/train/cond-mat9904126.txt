    "the differences between the bcs scenario of superconductivity and superconductivity in high-@xmath0 materials are well accepted as experimental facts , although there is no theoretical consensus about their origin .",
    "one of the most convincing manifestations is the pseudogap , or a depletion of the single particle spectral weight around the fermi level ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "another transparent manifestation is the temperature and carrier density dependencies of the superfluid density in high-@xmath0 superconductors ( htsc ) @xcite which do not fit the canonical bcs behaviour .",
    "in particular the value of the zero temperature superfluid density is substantially less than the total density of doped carriers @xcite .",
    "currently there are many possible explanations for the unusual properties of htsc .",
    "one of these is based on the nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid model @xcite .",
    "another explanation , proposed by anderson , relies on the separation of spin and charge degrees of freedom .",
    "one more approach , which we will follow in this paper , relates the observed anomalies to precursor superconducting fluctuations .",
    "different authors argue that alternative types of superconducting fluctuations are responsible for the pseudogap , e.g. @xcite , and the scenario based on the fluctuations of the order parameter phase suggested by emery and kivelson @xcite . the latter scenario we believe to be more relevant due to low superfluid density and practically 2d character of the conductivity in htsc mentioned above . a microscopic 2d model which elaborates the abovementioned scenario @xcite has been studied in the papers @xcite .",
    "the results obtained show that the condensate phase fluctuations indeed lead to features which are experimentally observed in htsc both in the normal and superconducting states .",
    "it is obvious , however , that the present treatment of the phase fluctuations is incomplete due both to the oversimplified character of the model and the absence of an explanation for the more recent advanced experiments @xcite on the temperature and doping dependencies of the superfluid density .",
    "it is well known , however , that the theoretical study of htsc faces a lot of computational difficulties due to , for example , a non - conventional order parameter symmetry , complex frequency - momentum dependence of the effective quasiparticle attraction , general form of the quasiparticle dispersion law , etc .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain analytical results , we have to date only considered nonretarded @xmath1-wave pairing in the absence of impurities .",
    "( the attempts to consider the retardation effects were done in @xcite . )",
    "nevertheless , a discussion of the effect of impurities seems to be crucial for a realistic model of the htsc .",
    "indeed , it is known , that the itinerant holes in htsc are created by doping which in turn introduces a considerable disorder into the system , for instance , from the random coulomb fields of chaotically distributed charged impurities ( doped ions ) @xcite .",
    "thus one the purposes of the present paper is to study the model @xcite but in the presence of nonmagnetic impurities .    in the theory of `` common metals '' the fermi energy @xmath2 and the mean transport quasiparticle time @xmath3",
    "are independent quantities which are always assumed to satisfy the criterion @xmath4 . in htsc which are `` bad metals '' @xcite both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are dependent on the doping and the abovementioned criterion may fail @xcite . as an illustration we refer to the remarkable linear dependence of the normal state resistivity @xcite which implies indeed that @xmath5 may be @xmath6 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that for strongly disordered metallic system superconductivity is absent if the scattering - to - pairing ratio exceeds a critical value and the existence of superconductivity in a finite range of doping if this ratio is not exceeded .",
    "we shall not study this case but rather consider here the more usual ( and in some sense simple ) situation , originally studied in the papers of anderson @xcite and abrikosov - gorkov ( ag ) @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , when the superconducting order is preexisting and the criterion @xmath4 is satisfied .    the anderson theorem @xcite states that in 3d the bcs critical temperature is unchanged in the presence of nonmagnetic impurities .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , the bcs critical temperature in 2d is the temperature @xmath7 at which the pseudogap opens , while the superconducting transition temperature transition is the temperature @xmath8 of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition .",
    "in contrast to the former , the latter is defined by a bare superfluid density ( given by the delocalized carriers ) which is dependent on ( see below ) the concentration of impurities .",
    "thus in 2d case the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath8 decreases with increasing impurity concentration .",
    "thus , in the model under consideration , the relative size of the pseudogap phase , @xmath9 is larger in the presence of impurities than in the clean limit @xcite . therefore it can be observed over a wider range of densities .",
    "the second result obtained is that the value of the zero temperature superfluid density is less than the total density of carriers ( dopants ) , so that the presence of impurities may contribute into this diminishing and in its turn explain the experimental results @xcite .",
    "finally we attempt to interpret qualitatively the recent experiments on the temperature dependence of the superfluid density @xcite within our scenario .",
    "a brief overview of the paper follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we present the model and derive the main equations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] we compare the results obtained for clean and dirty limits . in particular we compare the values of @xmath8 , the relative sizes of the pseudogap region and the values of the bare superfluid density at @xmath10 and @xmath11 close to @xmath12 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : superfluid ] an attempt is made to give an explanation for the experimental results @xcite .",
    "our starting point is a continuum version of the two - dimensional attractive hubbard model defined by the hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath13 , \\label{hamilton}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 denotes the space and imaginary time variables , @xmath15 is a fermion field with spin @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the effective fermion mass , @xmath18 is the chemical potential , @xmath19 is an effective local attraction constant , and @xmath20 is the static potential of randomly distributed impurities ; we take @xmath21 . the model with the hamiltonian ( [ hamilton ] ) is equivalent to a model with an auxiliary bcs - like pairing field which is given in terms of the nambu variables as @xmath22 \\psi(x )   + \\frac{|\\phi(x)|^2}{v } \\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath25 is the complex order field",
    ". then the partition function can be presented as a functional integral over fermi fields ( nambu spinors ) and the auxiliary fields @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "however , in contrast to the usual method , the modulus - phase parametrization @xmath28 $ ] is necessary for the 2d model at finite temperatures ( see @xcite and references therein ) . to be consistent with this replacement",
    "one should also introduce the spin - charge variables for the nambu spinors @xmath29\\upsilon(x ) \\label{nambu.phase}\\ ] ] with @xmath30 the field operator for neutral fermions .    from the hamiltonian ( [ hamilton ] ) , following @xcite , one can derive an effective one which is the hamiltonian of the classical xy - model @xmath31 ^ 2 \\label{xy.hamilton}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 \\nonumber                       \\\\ & & + \\frac{t}{32 m^2 \\pi^2 } \\sum_{n = -\\infty}^{\\infty } \\int d^2 k k^2 \\mbox{tr } [ \\langle \\mathcal { g}(i \\omega_{n } , \\mbox{\\bf k } ) \\rangle    \\langle \\mathcal { g}(i \\omega_{n } , \\mbox{\\bf k } ) \\rangle ] \\label{j}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the bare ( i.e. unrenormalized by the phase fluctuations , but including pair breaking thermal fluctuations ) superfluid stiffness . here",

    "this approximation , as shown by ag @xcite , does not change the final result for @xmath36 .",
    "note also that the green s function ( [ green.impurity ] ) is valid only when @xmath4 which demands the presence of a well developed fermi surface , which in turn implies that @xmath37 .",

    "when the modulus of the order parameter @xmath46 is treated in the mean field approximation , the equation for @xmath45 takes the following form @xcite @xmath47 , \\label{rho.gap}\\ ] ] which formally coincides with the gap equation of the bcs theory .",
    "this coincidence allows one to use the anderson theorem @xcite which states the dependence of @xmath48 is the same as that for the clean superconductor and not affected by the presence of nonmagnetic impurities .",
    "it is important to recall that this theorem is , of course , valid only for the @xmath1-wave pairing and small disorder .",
    "there is , however , both physical and mathematical differences between the gap in the bcs theory and @xmath45 @xcite . in particular the temperature @xmath12 which is estimated by the condition @xmath49 is not related to the temperature of the superconducting transition , but is interpreted as the temperature of pseudogap opening @xmath7 ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "the main point , which we would like only to stress here , is that due to the anderson theorem @xcite the value of @xmath12 does not depend on the presence of impurities , while the temperature @xmath8 , as we will show , is lowered .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath18 is defined by the number equation @xmath50 = n_f . \\label{number}\\ ] ] since we are interested in the high carrier density region the solution of ( [ number ] ) is @xmath37 , so that in eqs.([j.final ] ) - ( [ rho.gap ] ) one can replace @xmath18 by @xmath2 .",
    "having the temperatures @xmath12 and @xmath8 as functions of the carrier density one can build the phase diagram of the model @xcite which consists of three regions .",
    "the first one is the superconducting ( here bkt ) phase with @xmath51 at @xmath52 . in this region",
    "there is algebraic order , or a power law decay of the @xmath53 correlations .",
    "the second region corresponds to the pseudogap phase ( @xmath54 ) . in this phase @xmath45",
    "is still non - zero but the correlations mentioned above decay exponentially .",
    "the third is the normal ( fermi - liquid ) phase at @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "note that @xmath57 everywhere . while the given phase diagram was derived for the idealized 2d model ,",
    "there are indications that even for as complicated layered systems as htsc the value of the critical temperature for them may be well estimated using @xmath8 @xcite even though the transition undoubtedly belongs to the 3d xy class . it was also pointed out in @xcite that a nonzero gap in the one - particle excitation spectrum can persists even without long - range order .",
    "the transport time @xmath3 is infinite in the clean limit , so that @xmath58 near @xmath12 one can obtain from ( [ j.clean ] ) @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the zeta function .",
    "this expression must coincide with the result from @xcite which was derived using the opposite order for the summation and integration . inserting the well - known dependence of @xmath48 ( see , for example @xcite ) @xmath61 and then substituting ( [ j.clean.expand ] ) into ( [ bkt.temperature ] ) one obtains the following asymptotic expression for the bkt temperature in the clean limit for high carrier densities @xcite @xmath62    in the high density limit one can also use the equation @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the energy of the two - particle bound state in vacuum which is a more convenient parameter than the four - fermion constant @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "it is obvious from ( [ bkt.clean ] ) and ( [ rho.temperature ] ) that the pseudogap region shrinks rapidly for high carrier densities - wave pairing the high density limit is in fact equivalent the weak coupling bcs limit . ] and one may ask ( see , for example , @xcite ) whether this scenario can explain the pseudogap anomalies which are observed over a wide range of temperatures and carrier densities , since in the clean limit the relative size of the pseudogap region @xmath66 is , for instance , less than @xmath67 when the dimensionless ratio @xmath68 . a crude estimate for the dimensionless ratio for optimally doped",
    "cuprates gives @xmath69 - @xmath70 @xcite which indicates that in the clean superconductor the pseudogap region produced by the phase fluctuations is too small .",
    "of course , all these estimations are qualitative due to the simplicity of the model .",
    "the value of the bare superfluid density , @xmath71 is straightforwardly expressed via the bare phase stiffness , @xmath72 .",
    "in particular , it follows from ( [ j.clean ] ) that @xmath73 .",
    "this is not surprising since @xmath74 must be equal to the full density @xmath75 for any superfluid ground state in a translationary invariant system @xcite and the clean system is translationary invariant .",
    "we note , however , as stated above that in htsc @xmath76 @xcite . substituting ( [ rho.dependence ] ) into ( [ j.clean ] )",
    "one obtains for @xmath11 close to @xmath12 the bare superfluid density as @xmath77 .",
    "this behaviour of the bare superfluid density is formally the same as the behaviour of the full superfluid density in the bcs theory .",
    "nevertheless it is important to remember that the full superfluid density in the present model undergoes the nelson - kosterlitz jump at @xmath8 and is zero for @xmath78 .",
    "we note that one can probe experimentally both the bare superfluid density in high - frequency measurements @xcite and the full superfluid density in low - frequency measurements @xcite .      in the dirty limit",
    "the quasiparticle transport time @xmath3 is small ( @xmath79 ) so that one can neglect the radical in the bracket of ( [ j.final ] ) @xcite .",
    "the remaining series is easily summed and one obtains for the bare superfluid stiffness @xmath80    as explained above , due to the anderson theorem , the expressions ( [ rho.dependence ] ) for @xmath45 and ( [ rho.temperature ] ) for @xmath12 remain unchanged in the presence of impurities . again substituting ( [ rho.dependence ] ) into ( [ j.dirty ] )",
    "one obtains @xmath81 one can see that the size of the pseudogap region is now controlled by the new phenomenological parameter @xmath3 which is an unknown function of @xmath2 for htsc .",
    "the experimental data @xcite suggest that @xmath3 is almost independent on doping level in the underdoped region .",
    "it is difficult to obtain more than a qualitative estimate using eq.([bkt.dirty ] ) since in its derivation we have assumed that @xmath4 . in htsc however , as discussed above ( see also @xcite ) , this assumption is not always justified .",
    "bearing in mind that the dirty limit implies that the condition @xmath82 is satisfied , one can easily see that the value of @xmath8 for this case is less than that given by ( [ bkt.clean ] ) for the clean superconductor .",
    "since impurities are inevitably present in htsc , phase fluctuations can in fact give rise to a pseudogap region that is of comparable size to that experimentally observed .",
    "we note that our arguments are in fact quite similar to that given in @xcite for the best observing conditions for the bkt physics in superconducting films .",
    "however , in contrast to this paper , the gap opening below @xmath12 is particularly emphasized here .    while eq.([bkt.dirty ] ) was derived under assumption @xmath83 in general case when @xmath8 can be substantially less than @xmath12 the self - consistent equation ( [ bkt.temperature ] ) with @xmath84 given by ( [ j.dirty ] ) must be solved .",
    "recall , however , that to make any quantitative estimates , the more realistic @xmath85-wave model has to be considered and the inequality @xmath4 should not be assumed @xcite .    the value of the zero temperature superfluid density is now given by @xmath86 since @xmath87 .",
    "this does not contradict the results of @xcite because the system is not translationary invariant in the presence of impurities @xcite .",
    "furthermore as one can see , the low value of the superfluid density in htsc @xcite may be related to the impurities which are inevitably present in htsc .",
    "another reason which leads to lowering of the superfluid density is the presence of lattice which also destroys a continuous translational invariance .",
    "we note that as was pointed @xcite quantum fluctuations also lead to a decrease in the superfluid density .",
    "in this section we try to correlate the temperature dependence of the observed in - plane resistivity @xmath88 with the recently measured temperature dependence of the bare superfluid density @xcite .    for @xmath78",
    "the expression for the bare superfluid density in the dirty limit ( [ j.dirty ] ) can be rewritten in terms of the in - plane conductivity , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the charge of electron : @xmath91    the in - plane resistivity , @xmath92 in cuprates has been extensively studied @xcite and its temperature and concentration dependencies must reflect the pseudogap properties observed in other experiments .",
    "one can say that @xmath88 is linear above @xmath93 and roughly linear between @xmath8 and @xmath12 but with a lower slope .",
    "thus in the interval @xmath94 the resistance can be approximately written as @xmath95 , where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are functions of @xmath2 but not of temperature .",
    "now , substituting @xmath98 into eq.([j.conductivity ] ) , one obtains @xmath99 our estimations based on eq.([sup.phenomenological ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "one can see that , in contrast to the almost linear bcs dependence of @xmath100 , we have convex behaviour and the superfluid density becomes zero at @xmath12 .",
    "we stress that the curvature of @xmath71 is the result of both the temperature dependence of @xmath48 and @xmath101 for @xmath94 .",
    "more importantly the slope of the curve @xmath100 at @xmath12 for the dirty metal is substantially less than for the clean one .",
    "the experiment @xcite shows the same curvature for @xmath71 but indicates that the bare superfluid density disappears at a lower temperature , @xmath102 .",
    "since the slope @xmath103 at @xmath12 is very small , as predicted by eq.([sup.phenomenological ] ) and observed experimentally , the non - zero value of @xmath100 between @xmath104 and @xmath105 may however simply be too small to be experimentally observed .",
    "a definitive answer to this question demands further experiments and theoretical studies .",
    "in particular , @xmath45-fluctuations should be taken into account @xcite .",
    "one can also comment on the experimentally observed change in the curvature of the full superfluid density , @xmath106 , with changing carrier density @xcite even though @xmath106 can not be directly linked to the bare superfluid density @xmath71 discussed here .",
    "although the full superfluid density disappears above @xmath8 , the curvature present in the bare superfluid density @xmath100 seems to be retained as a curvature in the full superfluid density , @xmath106 , below @xmath8 @xcite . for low carrier densities ( the underdoped region ) the pseudogap region , @xmath94 , is larger and therefore the curvature in @xmath100 is more pronounced .",
    "this behaviour seems to be reflected in the full superfluid density , @xmath107 below @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it is important however to study experimentally and theoretically the concentration dependence of the bare superfluid density , @xmath71 to make a full comparison with the results from @xcite for @xmath106 .",
    "the experimental data of @xcite also show that @xmath106 does not display the nelson - kosterlitz jump .",
    "this is probably related to the influence of the interlayer coupling , see refs . in @xcite .",
    "since in htsc the pairing scale @xmath108 is different from the superconducting transition temperature the role of non - magnetic impurities is not traditional and they in fact define the superconducting properties of a `` bad metal '' .",
    "in particular the presence of nonmagnetic impurities strongly increases the size of the pseudogap phase originating from the fluctuations of the phase of the order parameter .",
    "in addition the behaviour of the superfluid density in the presence of the impurities is closer to that experimentally observed .",
    "our results are only qualitative since we have considered the model with non - retarded @xmath1-wave attraction and an isotropic fermion spectrum .",
    "however , it is likely that for @xmath85-wave pairing , the properties obtained will persist .",
    "there is , of course , a problem why a strong disorder does not destroy @xmath85-wave superconductivity when non - magnetic impurities are pair - breaking .",
    "as was suggested by sadovskii @xcite even @xmath85-wave pairing may persist if coupling is strong enough .",
    "further studies are necessary , for example , it is important to explain the concentration dependence of the superfluid slope , @xmath109 at @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "our results also indicate that it would be interesting to study the bcs - bose crossover problem in the presence of impurities , especially in @xmath85-wave case @xcite .",
