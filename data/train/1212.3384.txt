    "<S> many modern and proposed future particle accelerators rely on superconducting radio frequency cavities made of bulk niobium as primary particle accelerating structures . </S>",
    "<S> such cavities suffer from the anomalous field dependence of their quality factors @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> high field degradation - so - called high field q - slope - is yet unexplained even though an empirical cure is known . </S>",
    "<S> here we propose a mechanism based on the presence of proximity - coupled niobium hydrides , which can explain this effect . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the same mechanism can be present in any surface - sensitive experiments or superconducting devices involving niobium .    </S>",
    "<S> superconducting niobium is an important technological material used for e.g. superconducting radio frequency ( srf ) cavities and josephson junctions . </S>",
    "<S> srf cavities are primary particle accelerating structures in many modern accelerators ( i.e. cebaf , cesr , sns ) and the technology of choice for future ones ( i.e. ilc , xfel , frib , project x ) . </S>",
    "<S> bulk niobium is predominantly used to make such cavities due to its highest @xmath1 among pure elements and high enough critical fields . </S>",
    "<S> quality factor q@xmath2 of srf cavities is determined by the surface resistance via the formula : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the angular frequency , @xmath5 is stored energy calculated from the integral of the field over cavity volume , and @xmath6 is the power dissipated in cavity walls calculated as an integral of surface resistance over cavity walls . </S>",
    "<S> extremely low surface resistance in superconducting state and hence very high quality factors @xmath7 are achievable in such structures .    </S>",
    "<S> several decades of research demonstrated that the microwave surface resistance of niobium in superconducting state is very sensitive to heat and surface chemical treatments . </S>",
    "<S> such surface resistance is completely determined by the nanostructure within the magnetic field penetration depth @xmath8 100  nanometers where the screening currents flow . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the intrinsic bcs - described component coming from thermally excited quasiparticles there is a number of extrinsic contributions to losses . </S>",
    "<S> some of such contributions are understood ( trapped magnetic flux , field emission , multipacting ) , while many are not . among the unknown mechanisms </S>",
    "<S> are the ones leading to the so - called _ low , medium , and high field q - slopes _ , which correspond to , respectively , a decrease of @xmath9 in the field range of about 0 - 20  mt , mild increase in the range of 20 - 100  mt , and a drastic increase above about 100  mt ( see  @xcite for review ) . for reaching highest accelerating gradients ( highest sustainable surface fields ) and for highest quality factors ( lowest surface resistance ) medium and high field </S>",
    "<S> q - slopes present a significant obstacle . </S>",
    "<S> an empirical recipe has been developed to achieve highest gradients , which allows to eliminate the high field q - slope via a combination of electropolishing and 90 - 145@xmath10c baking in vacuum frequently referred to as `` mild baking '' . </S>",
    "<S> no controlled way to mitigate the medium field q - slope is known . </S>",
    "<S> understanding the mechanisms behind these effects is of uttermost importance for further progress in the srf field from both scientific and practical points of view .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the high field q - slope ( hfqs ) can be explained by the breakdown of the proximity effect acting on niobium hydrides in the near - surface layer . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , q - degradation phenomenon due to large niobium hydrides ( _ q - disease _ )  @xcite can be quantitatively described by the same model .    </S>",
    "<S> niobium is a material which exhibits high affinity for hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> hydrogen can enter niobium whenever the natural oxide layer of niobium pentoxide nb@xmath11o@xmath12 is absent . in niobium cavities it happens during standard chemical treatments ( buffered chemical polishing and electropolishing ) and during the cooldown and air exposure following high temperature furnace treatments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> inside niobium the distribution of hydrogen is non - uniform and exhibits the near - surface segregation . </S>",
    "<S> high values of 1 - 20 at.%  @xcite were reported for the concentration of hydrogen in the first several tens of nanometers below the surface while bulk hydrogen content is typically in the @xmath8 100 ppm range . </S>",
    "<S> vacuum heat treatments at t@xmath13600 - 900@xmath10c decrease the bulk concentration but the near - surface region is weakly affected and very high hydrogen concentration remains . in low rrr ( @xmath14 ) </S>",
    "<S> niobium most of hydrogen ( bulk and surface ) is trapped by interstitial impurities such as e.g. oxygen as manifested in the absence of q - disease in cavities made of such material . in the case of high rrr ( @xmath15300 ) </S>",
    "<S> cavities it is not the case and hydrogen can move and precipitate .    from nbh@xmath16 phase diagram  @xcite it follows that the near - surface hydrogen - rich layer should transition from solid solution into @xmath17-phase of niobium hydride upon cooldown below @xmath15100 - 150  k depending on the concentration . </S>",
    "<S> two important conditions which facilitate this transition are long enough diffusion length of hydrogen during the cooldown time in the precipitation temperature range and the presence of nucleation centers . </S>",
    "<S> typically , a `` fast '' cooldown is performed on cavities to avoid the q - disease , and it was believed that it allows to avoid any hydride precipitation . nevertheless , a simple estimate based on the typical cooldown between 150 and 2  k ( fnal data was used ) and the diffusion constant of hydrogen leads to the diffusion length of @xmath18  nm . </S>",
    "<S> this means that all the h within the segregation layer near the surface can precipitate during fast cooldown . </S>",
    "<S> such a scenario is depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cooldown_schematic](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a precipitation would lead to what is called a q - disease only if there is a significant bulk hydrogen concentration and longer cooldown allowing hydrides to grow large .    </S>",
    "<S> schematic of the effect of the cooldown on : ( a ) unbaked ; ( b ) baked at 120@xmath10c niobium . </S>",
    "<S> precipitation of niobium hydride around nucleation centers ( possibly vacancies ) leads to the _ increase _ of the electron m.f.p . ]    </S>",
    "<S> niobium hydrides were demonstrated to be normal conducting at t@xmath191.5  k  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , hydride precipitates will be subject to the superconducting proximity effect  @xcite and will have a non - zero order parameter up to a certain breakdown field @xmath20 at which meissner effect disappears . </S>",
    "<S> for the proximity effect in the normal / superconducting sandwich an important length scale is set by the normal metal coherence length . for and assuming the same fermi velocity @xmath21 for hydrides as nb ( @xmath22  cm / s ) we get @xmath23  nm . proximity effect does depend on temperature and two asymptotic cases @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 , @xmath27 is a normal metal thickness ) were considered in the literature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> based on the observations of the surface relief  @xcite the thickness @xmath27 of hydrides corresponding to the q - disease is of order and the corresponding @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> hydrides should be even smaller in size for the high field q - slope and hence in both cases we are in the limit of @xmath24 and the breakdown field is provided by : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the magnetic flux quantum , and . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath31 is the total electron density in the hydride , which may be different from that in niobium .    a direct evidence for the proximity effect in superconducting niobium cavities is provided by `` hydrogen q - disease '' . </S>",
    "<S> in this effect the microwave surface resistance does not change significantly up to peak surface magnetic fields of @xmath810  mt followed by a sharp increase . </S>",
    "<S> such a threshold may be interpreted as a breakdown field of surface hydrides of the corresponding size . </S>",
    "<S> surface relief measurements  @xcite of the hydrides formed under similar cooldown conditions to the ones leading to q - disease show that the thickness of hydrides responsible for such q - disease with @xmath32  mt is @xmath33  nm . </S>",
    "<S> then from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : hb ] it follows that the hydrides with average breakdown field of @xmath15100  mt corresponding to the hfqs onset should have smallest dimension of @xmath34  nm .    </S>",
    "<S> the proximity effect will also result in the suppression of the superconducting gap of the host niobium . </S>",
    "<S> for example , such a suppression attributed to nbo@xmath16 inclusions as a subject to the proximity effect was reported in the literature  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that hydrides are formed with the normal distribution of characteristic sizes @xmath27 then it follows from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : hb ] that the distribution of the breakdown fields @xmath20 is determined by the distribution of @xmath35 and has the c.d.f . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the mean and @xmath38 is the width of the breakdown field distribution . if we attribute the normal conducting surface resistance @xmath39 and surface density @xmath40 to niobium hydrides then the total surface resistance can be written as : @xmath41 such surface resistance dependence on field provides an excellent fit to experimental data on cavities with the high field q - slope and q - disease available to us . </S>",
    "<S> examples of fits using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : rs ] to the average surface resistance data are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : q_slope_fit ] and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : q_disease_fit ] ( average surface resistance is defined as @xmath42 , where g is a constant determined by cavity geometry ) .    </S>",

    "<S> as mentioned above , mild baking removes the high field q - slope in all but fine grain bcp cavities . </S>",
    "<S> based on the proposed mechanism of the high field q - slope we suggest that the main effect of mild baking is the complete absence or significantly smaller in size hydrides .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the effects of the mild baking on niobium is the drastic decrease in the electron m.f.p . within the penetration depth as deduced from fits to r@xmath44(t ) and directly measured lately with muon spin spectroscopy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unlike other suggested mechanisms our model can explain m.f.p . </S>",
    "<S> change without involving diffusion of other interstitials ( such as o , c , n ) by purely the effect of the precipitation of hydrides . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , if segregated hydrogen stays dispersed in the lattice then m.f.p . </S>",
    "<S> is determined by the average h - h distance . </S>",
    "<S> if the dispersed h precipitates into hydrides then the m.f.p . </S>",
    "<S> is either the mean hydride - hydride distance or determined by other less - abundant impurities ( o , c , n ) , which in both cases is much larger than h - h distance before precipitation . </S>",
    "<S> the schematic of the near - surface structure of baked / unbaked cavities within our model is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cooldown_schematic ] .    </S>",
    "<S> now we describe a possible mechanism of mild baking on the material level in further detail . </S>",
    "<S> it was demonstrated  @xcite that in the presence of a significant amount of hydrogen the formation energy of vacancies in niobium becomes much lower . </S>",
    "<S> this can lead to the very high concentrations of complexes consisting of a monovacancy and several hydrogen atoms ( vac - h ) . </S>",
    "<S> this process - a so - called `` superabundant vacancy '' formation  @xcite - was discovered in many metals including niobium . </S>",
    "<S> here we propose that the near - surface layer enriched with hydrogen in srf niobium cavities contains superabundant vacancies ( sav ) after chemical ( bcp or ep ) or vacuum heat ( 600 - 800@xmath10c ) treatments . </S>",
    "<S> the concentration of savs can be estimated from  @xcite , which for hydrogen concentration gives @xmath45 at . </S>",
    "<S> % .    </S>",
    "<S> it was discovered by positron annihilation studies  @xcite that vac - h complexes start dissociating at t@xmath4690@xmath10c , which agrees remarkably with the lowest effective temperature of mild baking found empirically . lately </S>",
    "<S> direct positron annihilation doppler broadening studies  @xcite on cutout samples from baked and unbaked cavities showed a strong decrease in the vacancy concentration brought about by 120@xmath10c bake . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that vac - h complexes dissociate during mild baking and the near - surface layer gets `` cleaned '' from vacancies by their diffusion to the surface and annihilation .    upon cooldown of srf cavities to cryogenic temperatures </S>",
    "<S> , vac - h complexes may serve as nucleation centers around which an @xmath17-phase of niobium hydride can form . in the case of the 120@xmath10c baked niobium the nucleation centers are absent and hydrides do not form . </S>",
    "<S> schematically such mechanism is depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cooldown_schematic ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of precipitate sizes is determined by the kinetics of hydrogen diffusion towards nucleation centers during cooldown . </S>",
    "<S> if for simplicity we assume that hydrides are spherical then we can estimate their diameters . </S>",
    "<S> taking vac - h complexes as nucleation centers with concentration @xmath47 at .  </S>",
    "<S> % and @xmath48 at.% in the first 20  nm , assuming all h will precipitate from the layer determined by diffusion length over `` fast '' cooldown @xmath49 , and @xmath50  ppm in the bulk we get @xmath51  nm in a very good agreement with the estimates above based on the breakdown field if we assume that the breakdown field of spherical precipitates can be approximated by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : hb ] as well .    </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that if no vac - h complexes are present , the nbh@xmath16 solution can be quenched to 2  k without any significant hydride formation , and no high field q - slope is observed .    </S>",
    "<S> a number of testable predictions can be made based on our model .    </S>",
    "<S> first , the @xmath52 dependence in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : rs ] predicts that @xmath9 should change the character / saturate deep in the high field q - slope when most of the hydrides become normal conducting . </S>",
    "<S> such saturation is observed for hydrogen q - disease and can be accessible at higher rf powers for the hfqs as well . </S>",
    "<S> it should be possible to check it with single cell cavities . </S>",
    "<S> we have observed hints of such saturation on two different cavities , but further testing at higher powers is required to confirm it .    </S>",
    "<S> second , if vac - h mechanism for mild baking is correct then reintroduction of vacancies in the near - surface layer should lead to the reappearance of the high field q - slope in the mild baked cavity . </S>",
    "<S> we are currently planning such an experiment with controlled introduction of vacancies by irradiation .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , nanoscale hydrides may be directly observable using techniques such as an in situ cold stage imaging with tem / stem . </S>",
    "<S> such a search is currently underway .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted further that if nanohydrides are present then the medium field q - slope can be explained by the field dependence of the proximity effect below h@xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> hence it may open up a possibility for further significant improvement in niobium cavities . </S>",
    "<S> the problem may be approached by the combination of heat treatment and `` sealing '' the surface with the niobium pentoxide before reabsorption rebuilds the interstitial hydrogen content . </S>",
    "<S> such experiments are currently underway at fnal .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , we have put forward a novel model for the high field q - slope based on the proximity effect acting upon niobium hydrides within the penetration depth . </S>",
    "<S> our model can also explain quantitatively the hydrogen q - disease , which we suggest has the same physical mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the mild baking effect is due to the strong suppression of hydride precipitation , which may be caused by the change in concentration of vac - h complexes .    </S>",
