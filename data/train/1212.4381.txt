    "many problems in science can be reduced to the eigenvalue / vector problem . the first eigenvalue / vector have sometimes particularly important meanings in these problems .",
    "for example , the first eigenvector of the transition probability matrix in physics represents the largest transfer direction . in quantum physics , the assessment of the ground state is generally formulated as a first eigenvalue / vector problem@xcite . to analyze the spin - glass system",
    ", we often use the spin - glass susceptibility as an indicator of the critical phenomena .",
    "the spin - glass susceptibility is derived from the covariance matrix of its spins , so that the first eigenvalue of the correlation matrix plays an important role , especially at the critical point@xcite .",
    "we show the density function of the first eigenvalues / vectors that are evaluated from the adjacency matrices of the networks whose nodes have two different types with respect to their degrees in this paper .",
    "the adjacency matrix of this network is also reduced to a subset of the random sparse matrices and it seems that the property of the density function of the eigenvalues / vectors on such matrices has not been clarified very well so far , especially on the first eigenvector distribution .",
    "we show the dependence of the density function on the ratio of two different degrees in this paper .",
    "if a network is constructed with two different types of nodes with respect to the degree then the distribution of its first eigenvector has fat tails such as the stable distribution ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) under a certain condition ; whereas if a network is constructed with only one type of degree , the distribution of its first eigenvector is the gaussian distribution , approximately .",
    "we calculate the first eigenvalue / vector that is derived from taking the large system limit , using our developed scheme@xcite based on the cavity method and the scheme is applicable to a wide variety of networks . in the population dynamics method which we use to assess the density function of the cavity field of the network",
    ", we need to employ the sequential update strategy for a stable convergence , which will be explained later .",
    "we evaluate two dimensional density function of the cavity fields in this paper , whereas we mainly discussed the case that the independence can be assumed for two variables of the cavity fields in ref .",
    "[ ] , i.e. @xmath3 .",
    "we also explore a poissonian network and a laplacian matrix for comparison .",
    "we show that the poissonian network and the network whose nodes have two different types of degrees with a certain ratio have many similar properties .",
    "this similarity is clarified by the results of the cavity method .",
    "this means that many network properties are defined by the ratio of nodes that have the largest degree .",
    "we show the shape of the density functions , whereas we used the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) to evaluate the skewness of the density function of the eigenvectors in ref .",
    "we found a richer structure in the shape of the density function and we will describe those in this paper .",
    "the poisonian netwrok is one of the most well - known erds - rnyi model which have been widely studied in network science@xcite .",
    "the poissonian network is also related with the graph bisection problem@xcite .    using the diagonal matrix and the adjacency matrix which can be regarded as a random symmetric matrix",
    ", we can compose a laplacian matrix .",
    "random impedance networks can be represented by a laplacian matrix and we can evaluate the density of resonances of the networks as the spectral density of the eigenvalues@xcite . the well - known google pagerank@xmath4 ranks world wide web pages on the basis of the first eigenvector of the laplcian matrix whose entries represent the number of links of a huge network constructed with web pages@xcite . in networks science , the first eigenvector of the adjacency matrix is called the eigenvector centrality .    many properties have been clarified for the spectral density of the eigenvalues that are evaluated from the ensembles of large random matrices .",
    "we can find this clarified knowledge in random matrix theory and its related topics@xcite . in random matrix theory , we also find a knowledge on the _ first _ eigenvalue distribution of dense matrices which is called as the tracy - widom distribution .",
    "however , relatively little is known about the distribution of the eigenvalues / vector for the random sparse matrices@xcite . the problem which can be described by a random matrix with a constraint",
    "is related to a wide region of science , e.g. , combinatorial problems in computer science@xcite , statistical properties of disordered conductors and of chaotic quantum systems@xcite , since wigner designed the random matrix theory to deal with the statistics of eigenvalues / vectors of complex many - body quantum systems@xcite .",

    "concluding remarks are presented in the final section .",
    "in this section , we describe the method of constructing the network which is discussed in this paper . for this purpose ,",
    "we make use of an adjacency matrix which uniquely defines the network structure .",
    "we construct the network whose nodes have two different types of degrees and it will be referred as 2-dtd network or 2-dtd model hereafter . this network can be regarded as one of the simplest cases of a network that generally has various types of nodes with respect to the degree .",
    "we also explore the networks whose degree distribution is the poissonian distribution and that might be one typical case among networks that has various types of nodes with respect to the degree .",
    "this network is often mentioned as a model for the world wide web network and other scientific structures",
    ". we also find it in the bisection problem .",
    "consider a @xmath5 real symmetric sparse matrix @xmath6 that is characterized by a distribution @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the number of non - zero entries in a column / row of the matrix and represents the degree of the corresponding node .",
    "we set the diagonal elements of the matrices to zero , because we assume that there are no self - loops in the network .",
    "we define @xmath9 that represents the degree of a node indexed @xmath10 ) as follows : we draw a number @xmath11 from the stochastic variable obeying the distribution @xmath7 and set @xmath12 , and repeat the same procedure for all @xmath13 .",
    "now , we randomly decide the non - zero entries in a @xmath5 adjacency matrix which represents the links of the network as the following algorithm@xcite :    * prepare a set of indices @xmath14 in that each index @xmath15 attends @xmath9 times .",
    "* repeat the following until no suitable pair can be found .",
    "choose a pair of elements @xmath16 from @xmath14 , randomly .",

    "* if @xmath14 is empty , finish the algorithm .",
    "otherwise , return to ( s ) and start over again .",
    "we set 1 to the elements of the adjacency matrix as corresponding with the link of the above network .",
    "this construction agrees with the usual definition of adjacency matrix .    here , we modify the above adjacency matrix as follows .",
    "we replace the values of the non - zero entries symmetrically i.e. @xmath19 , and stochastically obeying the following probability : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the dirac delta function and @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath23 controls the number of the negative entries which represent the links between two different groups in the bisection problem .",
    "we interpret the negative entries as frustrations that are often discussed in the spin glass model .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss a property of an ensemble average of the modified adjacency matrices that generate from the same algorithm . for this purpose",
    ", we made the thousands of networks , running the above algorithm .      within the set of networks that have two different types of nodes with respect to the degree",
    ", we mainly focus on the networks whose nodes are the 4 or 8 degrees with ratio 0.9:0.1 : @xmath24 for comparison , we also show results on several other cases as follows : the ratio is different from the above case , the value of the larger degree is different , and the network that all nodes are the same with respect to the degree .",
    "as regards a poissonian network , if the support of the number of degrees is not bound by a maximum value , i.e. the number of non - zero entries in each row / column is infinite , the first eigenvalue generally diverges as @xmath25 . to avoid this phenomenon",
    ", we assume that @xmath26 for @xmath27 larger than a certain value which is denoted by @xmath28 . to normalize the probability distribution ,",

    "in order to verify our results , we compare the results obtained by the cavity method with those evaluated by the power method .",
    "the first eigenvalue / vector problem can be formulated as an optimization problem : @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the minimization with respect to @xmath37 . from the above optimization",
    ", we derive the optimal values of @xmath37 which equal to the eigenvector @xmath38 of the matrix @xmath39 .",

    "the cycles lengths in the connectivity graph , constructed by random sparse matrices , typically grow as @xmath68 when @xmath25 @xcite , and thus , we can ignore the effects of the cycles .",
    "we apply a macroscopic approximation to the cavity fields and describe those as a two - dimensional distribution , i.e. , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the number of nodes directly connecting to node @xmath15 .",
    "when we choose an edge randomly and observe one terminal of the edge , the probability that the degree of the node is @xmath27 is described as @xmath71 using this probability , we can describe the following self - consistent equation of @xmath72 , which is consistent with eqs .",

    "the cavity method also works sufficiently well for the poissonian network model .",
    "2 .   concerning the poissonian network model ,",
    "many important features such as the heavy tail for the density function and the shape of the first eigenvalue are similar to the results of the network that has only two different types of nodes with respect to the degree .",
    "we showed the properties of the first eigenvalue / vector for several kinds of adjacency matrices .",
    "the cavity method is available for all those matrices .",
    "it is often necessary to know the properties of an infinite large system in many studies such as the combinatorial problems , the random matrix problems , the network science and so on .",
    "therefore it is important to establish a searching method such as the cavity method to explore the properties of the infinite large system . in this paper",
    ", we mainly focused on 2-dtd model and the poissonian model .",
    "we also explored the laplacian matrix and confirmed that the cavity method can be useful for that , see appendix .",
    "the value of the critical point of @xmath194 for degree 4 network is still unknown",
    ". it might not be easy to find the critical value using the methods in this paper .",
    "therefore , it is required to find another method capable of rigorously determining the critical point @xmath194 . the finite scaling method might be useful to determine the critical point @xmath194 , whereas it is known to be hard sometimes@xcite .",
    "we showed in 2-dtd model that the density function of the eigenvectors has fat tails , i.e. , it decays as the power law , when the ratio of the larger degree nodes is small ; whereas the density function decays exponentially , when the majority or none of nodes are the larger degree .",
    "it seems that the power low decay of the density function originate from the construction of network , not from the variety of the degrees of nodes , if we consider the results of 2-dtd model and the poissonian network model .",
    "there must be certain rule between the degree distribution and observables .",
    "for example , there must be a rule on the ratio of degrees so that the tail of the density becomes the power law for small @xmath139 in 2-dtd model .",
    "so far , we confirmed that using the cavity method , we observe a power law decay at the tail of the density when the network nodes have two different types of the degrees which are 4 and 8 with the ratio 0.5:0.5 . , whereas we can not observe a power law decay using the analysis of the adjacency matrices whose sizes are @xmath195 .",
    "deciding boundary of @xmath196 and finding the relationship between the exponent of the density s decay and the ratio of degrees will be a future study .",
