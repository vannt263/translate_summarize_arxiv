    "<S> this is true in particular for the gluon , since this quantity contributes to dis in leading order ( lo ) only via the @xmath0-dependence of the spin asymmetry ( @xmath1 ) , which could not be thoroughly studied experimentally so far . in the near future </S>",
    "<S> , the improved capabilities of handling polarized beams will allow high - energy colliders to operate in polarized mode , thus giving the possibility to study polarized scattering in a way complementary to dis . at the rhic collider at bnl , the first proton  proton polarized collisions are expected in two years from now . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility that the electron  </S>",
    "<S> proton hera collider at desy will run with polarized beams has also been considered for a long time  @xcite .    at variance with dis , </S>",
    "<S> collider physics offers a relatively large number of processes whose dependence upon the gluon density is dominant already at lo . </S>",
    "<S> the study of these processes is therefore crucial in order to measure this density in a direct way . among the various high transverse momentum reactions with a sizeable gluonic contribution , </S>",
    "<S> jet production is an obvious candidate , because of the large rates . at hera </S>",
    "<S> , the largest cross sections will be obtained by retaining those events where the electron is scattered at very small angles with respect to the beam line . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , the photon exchanged between the electron and the proton is almost on - shell , and the underlying dynamics is that of a photoproduction process .    as was shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , a polarized version of the hera collider with @xmath2 gev would be a very promising and useful facility for studying polarized photoproduction reactions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , jet production cross sections display a strong sensitivity to the polarized gluon distribution of the proton . </S>",
    "<S> however , the analysis of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is based on a lowest order qcd computation . from unpolarized </S>",
    "<S> physics it is well known that , in order to describe the data in a satisfactory way , the calculation of next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections to the jet cross sections is mandatory .    the computation of the nlo qcd corrections to one- and two - jet production in polarized photon  </S>",
    "<S> hadron collisions is the purpose of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> as is well known , in qcd photoproduction cross sections are written as the sum of two terms ( point - like and hadronic components ) , neither of which is physically meaningful by itself . </S>",
    "<S> the hadronic part , in which the photon behaves like a hadron , can be accounted for by using the available results for jet production in polarized hadron  </S>",
    "<S> hadron scattering  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nlo qcd corrections for the point - like part are presented in this paper for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> such a calculation needs the one - loop @xmath3 and tree - level @xmath4 polarized amplitudes as input ( one of the particles in the initial state being the photon and the other a quark or gluon ) . </S>",
    "<S> these amplitudes are already known  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the next step is to implement them in a monte carlo code which allows the calculation of any three - parton infrared - safe observable . in order to do this </S>",
    "<S> , we will use the general algorithm , based on the subtraction method , presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> following the same strategy as already adopted in the case of polarized hadron  </S>",
    "<S> hadron collisions  @xcite , we build a modified version of the monte carlo code of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which deals with unpolarized photon  </S>",
    "<S> hadron collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the reader can find further details in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in photoproduction processes initiated by an electron , the electron can be considered to be equivalent to a beam of real photons , whose distribution in energy ( weizscker  williams function  @xcite ) can be computed theoretically . the polarized electron  </S>",
    "<S> hadron cross section reads d_eh(k_e , k_h)=_y_min^y_max dy f_^(e)(y)d_h(yk_e , k_h ) , [ sigeppol ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the momenta of the incoming electron and hadron respectively , and are fixed by kinematical boundary conditions or experimental cuts . </S>",
    "<S> the quantities @xmath7 appearing in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sigeppol ] ) are defined in terms of cross sections for incoming particles of definite helicities d= ( d(+,+)+d(-,- ) -d(+,-)-d(-,+ ) ) . </S>",

    "<S>  williams functions ( and , respectively ) can be computed . </S>",
    "<S> as far as the unpolarized case is concerned , we use the form  @xcite f_^(e)(y)= . </S>",
    "<S> [ wwfununp ] notice that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ wwfununp ] ) contains a non - logarithmic term with a singular behaviour for . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this term was shown to give non - negligible contributions ( of about 7% and 5% for @xmath8  gev@xmath9 and @xmath10  gev@xmath9 , respectively ) in the case of unpolarized jet production at hera . </S>",
    "<S> one expects an analogous non - logarithmic term to appear also in the polarized weizscker  </S>",
    "<S> williams function . to the best of our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> however , such a term has never been presented in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore computed from scratch . </S>",
    "<S> we closely follow the procedure of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , in which the interested reader will find further details . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the generic production process e(p;n)+a(k;s)e(p^)+x , q = p - p^ , where @xmath11 is a parton whose momentum @xmath12 , which is kept off - shell for the time being , will eventually be put on - shell , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 are spin vectors . in the case of polarized scattering , </S>",
    "<S> we only need the antisymmetric part of the partonic and leptonic tensors ( see for example ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) : & & w^_a= = i ^q _ , [ parttens ] + & & t^_a= = -2im_e ^n_q _ , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the usual structure functions relevant to polarized collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the spin vectors for the incoming electron and parton can be written as n_=n_n ( p_-k _ ) , s_=n_s ( k_-p _ ) , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are normalization factors such that . </S>",
    "<S> the spin vectors satisfy the transversality conditions and . </S>",
    "<S> the electron  </S>",
    "<S> parton cross section follows from direct computation and @xmath16 in series of @xmath19 : the remaining terms give non - factorizable corrections which are suppressed by powers of @xmath20 . ] </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) : d_ea(p , k)&= & + & = & - dq^2 dy . </S>",
    "<S> [ sigmaea ] notice that the terms proportional to @xmath16 drop from this equation . </S>",
    "<S> this expression can be related to the polarized cross section for real photon  parton scattering , which can be computed by convoluting the parton tensor of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ parttens ] ) with the antisymmetric part of the photon polarization density matrix , p^_a=(^^- ^^ ) = ^ q_t _ , where @xmath23 is the photon polarization vector and @xmath24 is its spin vector t_=n_t ( q_-k _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> we get ( @xmath25 ) _ </S>",
    "<S> a(q , k)= w^_a p_a= . </S>",
    "<S> [ sigmagammaa ] combining eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sigmaea ] ) and  ( [ sigmagammaa ] ) , and integrating over @xmath19 in the accessible kinematical range ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , we get d_ea(p , k)= _ a(yp , k)f_^(e)(y)dy , where f_^(e)(y)= . </S>",
    "<S> [ wwfunpol ] we therefore find that also in the case of polarized scattering a non - logarithmic term is present . </S>",
    "<S> this term , at variance with the unpolarized case , is not singular for @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> however , exactly as in the unpolarized case , its behaviour for small @xmath27 is equal to the behaviour of the term that multiplies the logarithm .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now go back to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sigeppol ] ) , and compute . using the factorization theorems of qcd , </S>",
    "<S> we can write d_h(k_,k_h)= d^point_h(k_,k_h ) + d^hadr_h(k_,k_h ) , [ sigmagp ] where d^point_h(k_,k_h)&=&_jdx f^(h)_j(x,_h^ ) d_j(k_,xk_h,_s(_r^),_r^,_h^ , _ ) , [ pointcomp ] + d^hadr_h(k_,k_h ) & = & _ ijdx dy f^()_i(x , _ ) </S>",

    "<S> s(_r^),_r^,_h^ , _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ hadrcomp ] we remind the reader that the two terms in the rhs of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sigmagp ] ) ( denoted as point - like and hadronic components ) are not separately well defined in perturbative qcd beyond leading order : only their sum is physically meaningful . </S>",
    "<S> the polarized parton distribution functions and are defined , as usual , in terms of densities for partons of definite helicity in hadrons of definite helicity ( @xmath28 : f^(a)_i = f^(a+)_i+-f^(a+)_i- = f^(a-)_i -- f^(a-)_i+ . </S>",
    "<S> [ deltafdef ] the subtracted partonic cross sections and are finite at any order in qcd and , for the purpose of this paper , have been evaluated to nlo ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> notice that while the dependence upon the scales @xmath31 and @xmath32 cancels ( up to nnlo terms ) in the point - like and hadronic components separately , the dependence upon @xmath33 in the point - like component is compensated by a corresponding dependence in the hadronic component . </S>",
    "<S> we finally point out that equations completely similar to eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sigmagp])([hadrcomp ] ) also hold for unpolarized scattering .    in what follows </S>",
    "<S> , we will present phenomenological predictions relevant to hera physics . to this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we will evaluate both the polarized and unpolarized cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> since one of the major goals of high - energy colliders in the polarized mode will be that of studying the polarized parton densities , we will make a definite choice for the unpolarized densities throughout the paper , and study the dependence of our predictions for the asymmetries upon the polarized densities . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we will adopt the set mrsa@xmath34  @xcite for the unpolarized proton , and the set grv - ho  @xcite for the unpolarized photon . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath35 associated to mrsa@xmath34 ( @xmath36  mev ) is well below the current world average ; however , it is closer to the value of @xmath35 associated to grv - ho and to all the polarized sets we are going to use </S>",
    "<S> . the use of more modern proton sets would only affect the absolute normalization of the cross sections , without any sizeable change in the shape of the distributions .    as far as the polarized densities in the proton are concerned , dis data available at present leave the gluon density largely unconstrained , while they determine the quark densities to a reasonable extent . </S>",
    "<S> several parametrizations are therefore available , whose gluon densities are very different from each other . </S>",
    "<S> we will consider the following sets : grsv std and grsv maxg  @xcite , dss1 , dss2 and dss3  @xcite , and gs - c  @xcite ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a discussion about this choice and a comparison between the various sets ) . </S>",
    "<S> grsv std will be the default set when studying the perturbative stability of our results .    </S>",
    "<S> the polarized densities in the photon are completely unmeasured so far , and models for them have to be invoked . to obtain a realistic estimate for the theoretical uncertainties due to these densities </S>",
    "<S> , we use the two very different scenarios considered in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , assuming `` maximal '' ( @xmath37 ) or `` minimal '' ( @xmath38 ) saturation of the positivity constraint @xmath39 at the input scale @xmath40 ( @xmath41 gev ) ) for the qcd evolution ( here , the unpolarized densities are those of the set grv - ho ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding sets are denoted as sv  max  @xmath42 and sv  min  @xmath42 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the former will be our default choice when studying perturbative stability .    in order to compute the nlo results consistently </S>",
    "<S> , we will use the nlo - evolved version of the previously mentioned parton distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that these nlo - evolved sets will also be used to compute the born results ; indeed , as observed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the use of lo - evolved parton distributions could introduce differences between the lo and nlo cross sections that are much larger than those that can be expected on the basis of perturbative considerations .    since this paper presents the first nlo calculation of jet cross sections in polarized photon  </S>",
    "<S> hadron collisions , it is mandatory to assess the effect of the radiative corrections . </S>",
    "<S> lacking an nnlo computation , the most reliable estimate of the theoretical uncertainty affecting our results comes from the study of the dependence upon the mass scales entering eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pointcomp ] ) and  ( [ hadrcomp ] ) , at fixed values of the other input parameters . unless otherwise specified , we will set all the scales equal to a common value @xmath43 , and vary @xmath43 in the range . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath44 is the default scale , which we set equal to half of the total transverse energy of the event ; other sensible choices for @xmath44 give completely similar results . </S>",
    "<S> from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sigeppol ] ) , it is clear that all the dynamical information on the @xmath45 process in the weizscker  </S>",
    "<S> williams approximation are contained in the @xmath46 cross section . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we will study the scale dependence of our results using monochromatic photon  </S>",
    "<S> proton collisions at @xmath47  gev ; the scale dependence at lower centre - of - mass energies , and in electron  </S>",
    "<S> proton collisions , is comparable or milder .    </S>",
    "<S> we start by considering the single - inclusive jet pseudorapidity , requiring @xmath48 gev , where @xmath49 is the transverse momentum of the jet . </S>",
    "<S> the jet has been defined using the cone algorithm with @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the results for polarized and unpolarized cross sections are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : eta ] . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the radiative corrections is larger in the case of unpolarized collisions ; in the case of polarized collisions , the contributions from the various partonic subprocesses do not have the same sign , and cancellations occur . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the variation of the scale induces a variation of the cross section of the order of 10% over most of the @xmath51 range considered . </S>",
    "<S> the scale dependence is strongly reduced when going from born ( boxes and circles ) to nlo ( dashed and dotted histograms ) results . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is not true in the region of negative @xmath51 s , where the scale dependence of the born cross section is very small , and smaller than that of the nlo results . </S>",
    "<S> this could be the signal of a failure of the perturbative expansion , which would be extremely relevant from the phenomenological point of view , since it is precisely from this region that one hopes to extract information on the gluon density in the proton  @xcite .    in order to understand this point , </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the scale dependence of our results more carefully , by varying separately all the scales that enter eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pointcomp ] ) and  ( [ hadrcomp ] ) . at the born level , </S>",
    "<S> the hadronic component has a relatively mild @xmath52 dependence , a sizeable @xmath33 dependence , and a very large @xmath53 dependence . </S>",
    "<S> although the @xmath33 and @xmath53 variations tend to compensate each other , the latter is dominant , and the overall result is a large scale dependence , which is precisely the effect we see in the positive @xmath51 region in fig .  [ fig : eta ] , where the hadronic component is dominant . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the point - like component displays a dependence upon @xmath54 and @xmath55 of about the same size , but opposite in sign ( at the born level , the point - like component does not depend upon @xmath33 ) , and a simultaneous variation of the two scales leads to an almost perfect cancellation of the effects induced by them . </S>",
    "<S> this is the origin of the small scale dependence of the born result that we see in the negative @xmath51 region in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : eta ] . when going to nlo , in the hadronic contribution the @xmath52 dependence basically reduces to zero , and the @xmath53 dependence is sizeably reduced ; this is what we expect , as remarked after eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ deltafdef ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath33 dependence is also reduced , although it remains sizeable ; indeed , the effects of the variation of @xmath33 are only partially cancelled in the hadronic component , since the complete cancellation ( up to nnlo terms ) takes place when the point - like component is included . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we can observe this cancellation by looking at the @xmath33 dependence of the point - like component at nlo , whose size is almost the same as that of the hadronic component , but opposite in sign . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the @xmath54 and @xmath55 dependences of the point - like component are largely reduced with respect to the corresponding dependences at lo . in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the scale dependence of the @xmath51 distribution is consistent with what we expect from perturbative considerations . </S>",
    "<S> the small scale dependence of the born result in the negative @xmath51 region is only due to an incidental cancellation , which takes place when fixing all the scales to the same value . a more sophisticated treatment of the scale dependence would result in a scale dependence larger at the born level than at the nlo level .    </S>",
    "<S> we also studied several double differential observables , by considering the two leading jets of each event . </S>",
    "<S> as an example , we present in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : mjj ] the invariant mass of the pair . </S>",
    "<S> we require the hardest ( next - to - hardest ) jet to have transverse momentum larger than 15  gev ( 10  gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> we do not impose any @xmath51 cuts , in order to maximize the scale dependence ( as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : eta ] , the scale dependence is larger for the smallest and largest accessible @xmath51 values , since they correspond to small transverse momenta ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the case of @xmath51 cuts simulating a realistic geometrical acceptance , the scale dependence of our results would be smaller . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the case of the invariant mass is pretty similar to the case of single - inclusive pseudorapidity . </S>",
    "<S> the size of radiative corrections is larger in the case of unpolarized scattering , and the scale dependence of the polarized result is comparable to that of the unpolarized one . </S>",
    "<S> a reduction of the scale dependence can be observed when going from lo to nlo , except for the region close to the threshold , where there is no contribution at the born level ( due to the asymmetric transverse - momentum cuts ) , and the nlo result is effectively a lo one .    </S>",
    "<S> for all the single - inclusive and double - differential jet observables that we have studied , the same pattern as outlined above is reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> the size of radiative corrections is usually smaller in the polarized case than in the unpolarized case . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of nlo terms reduces the magnitude of the scale dependence with respect to the lo results , in both the polarized and unpolarized cases . when considering double - differential cross sections , special care has to be taken in the case where the cuts on the transverse momenta of the two leading jets are set to the same value , since there are regions in the phase space where the perturbative computation fails to give a sensible prediction </S>",
    "<S> this situation has been discussed at length in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for unpolarized jet production . </S>",
    "<S> we did not find any major difference in the case of polarized scattering . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigated the effect of changing the jet definition , by considering the @xmath56 algorithm proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this basically only amounts to a change in the normalization , while the effects due to the variation of the scales are of the same size as those studied above . finally </S>",
    "<S> , the perturbative stability of the results obtained with different parton densities is identical to the one presented here .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the problem of studying the dependence of our results upon the available proton and photon polarized parton densities . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we will consider electron  </S>",
    "<S> proton collisions in the weizscker  williams approximation , setting @xmath57  gev , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath8  gev@xmath9 ( see eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sigeppol ] ) , ( [ wwfununp ] ) and  ( [ wwfunpol ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> all the scales will be set to the default value . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : asy ] we present the results for the asymmetry _ = , [ asyeta ] where @xmath51 is the pseudorapidity of the single - inclusive jet . </S>",
    "<S> a cut of @xmath48  gev has been applied . on the lhs of the figure , </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen grsv std as the polarized proton set , and we evaluated the results for both the polarized photon sets we consider in this paper . the born and nlo results are both shown . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that in the large ( positive ) @xmath51 region the difference induced by the choice of the two photon sets is extremely large . on the other hand , towards negative @xmath51 values this difference tends to vanish . </S>",
    "<S> this is because in that region the point - like component , which does not depend upon photon densities , is the dominant one . </S>",
    "<S> we can also observe that in the positive @xmath51 region there is a very small difference between the nlo and lo results , while for negative @xmath51 s the radiative corrections are positive and reduce the asymmetry considerably . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noticing that , as can be seen from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : eta ] , this reduction is mainly due to the increase of the unpolarized cross section at nlo with respect to lo , while the polarized result is basically unchanged . on the rhs of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : asy ] , we show the curves obtained by fixing the polarized photon set to , and by considering the various polarized proton sets . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the largest differences can be seen at negative @xmath51 values , where theoretical predictions can vary for about one order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the asymmetries is quite similar for all the sets , except for gs - c ; this reflects the fact that the shape of the gs - c gluon is rather different from the shape of the gluons of the other sets . </S>",
    "<S> the same effect has indeed been observed in polarized @xmath60 collisions  @xcite .    on the lhs of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : asy ] we also show ( dotted lines ) an estimate of the minimum value of the asymmetry observable at hera . </S>",
    "<S> this is calculated using the following formula ( a_)_min= , [ amin ] where @xmath61 is the integrated luminosity , @xmath62 is the polarization of the electron ( proton ) beam , and the factor @xmath63 accounts for experimental efficiencies ; @xmath64 is the unpolarized cross section integrated over a range in rapidity ( @xmath65 ) , which has been chosen , for the present case , equal to @xmath66 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : asy ] we used , and @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that , if high luminosity will be collected , it will be possible to get information on the polarized parton densities in the proton , given the fact that realistic values for the polarization of the beams will be such that @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the cross section corresponding to sets such as dss3 or gs - c will be hardly measurable at hera , regardless of the luminosity collected . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the bin size @xmath65 can be enlarged ; this would result in a smaller observable asymmetry , at the price of a loss in resolution . </S>",
    "<S> as far as the polarized photon densities are concerned , if the `` real '' densities are similar to those of the set sv  min  @xmath42 , it will be extremely hard to even get the experimental evidence of a hadronic contribution to the polarized cross section . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , a set like sv  max  @xmath42 appears to give measurable cross sections , but this conclusion strongly depends upon the polarized proton densities . as observed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , sensible information on the polarized photon densities will be obtained only after a more precise knowledge of the proton densities will be availabe . at this point , we have to comment upon the effect of the non - logarithmic term in the polarized weizscker  williams function . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that , for the single - inclusive distribution we are studying here , this term reduces the absolute value of the cross section by a factor of about 6% . </S>",
    "<S> since the non - logarithmic term in the unpolarized case also reduces the cross section by a factor of about 7%  @xcite , it follows that the asymmetry is to a good extent independent from the presence of non - logarithmic terms in the weizscker  </S>",
    "<S> williams functions . finally , </S>",
    "<S> if a different jet definition is adopted , the asymmetries change for less than 1% ; this feature has already been observed in the case of @xmath60 collisions  @xcite .    in principle , it is conceivable to study asymmetries also for monochromatic photon  </S>",
    "<S> proton collisions . from the experimental point of view </S>",
    "<S> , this would correspond to selecting events with the weizscker  </S>",
    "<S> williams @xmath27 ( that is , the fraction of electron energy carried away by the photon ) in a given narrow range ( which corresponds to taking @xmath69 and @xmath70 very close to each other in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sigeppol ] ) ) . if we compute the asymmetry of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ asyeta ] ) with instead of @xmath71 , the values we obtain are larger than those shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : asy ] . for @xmath72  </S>",
    "<S> gev , the asymmetry can be twice as large as that obtained using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ asyeta ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , this is not sufficient . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , what is actually measured at hera is an electron  proton cross section . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to get a physically observable quantity one should multiply the @xmath46 asymmetry by the ratio of the integral of the polarized weizscker  </S>",
    "<S> williams function in the range over the same integral calculated for the unpolarized function . </S>",
    "<S> this ratio tends to zero for ( is kept fixed ) , thus disfavouring the measurement of the asymmetry at small photon  </S>",
    "<S> proton centre - of - mass energies .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we reported the first calculation of jet cross sections in polarized photon  hadron collisions , which is accurate to nlo in perturbative qcd . </S>",
    "<S> for all the observables considered , it has been found that the size of the radiative corrections is moderate , and that the scale dependence is smaller than that of the lo result . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of the nlo terms reduces the size of the asymmetries in the pseudorapidity region where the contamination from the hadronic photon contribution is minimal . in order to get information on the polarized gluon densities in the proton and in the photon , a very high luminosity </S>",
    "<S> must be collected at hera . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculated the universal , non - logarithmic term in the polarized weizscker  </S>",
    "<S> williams function . </S>",
    "<S> its contribution to the cross sections is small with respect to the logarithmic term , analogously to what happens in the unpolarized case . </S>"
