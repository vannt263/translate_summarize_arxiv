    "josephson junctions are natural voltage - to - frequency converters , since a finite voltage drop across the junction always leads to oscillating current with frequency proportional to the voltage ( _ ac _ josephson effect @xcite ) .",
    "this fundamental property suggested an attractive possibility to use the ac josephson effect for developing of voltage - tunable generators of electromagnetic waves .",
    "radiation from a josephson junction directly into the waveguide in the microwave frequency range has been indeed detected a long time ago @xcite .",
    "however , the typical detected radiated power @xmath11pw occurred to be too small for practical applications .    a natural route to enhance this power is to use large arrays of junctions .",
    "this possibility has been extensively explored by several experimental groups , see reviews @xcite .",
    "when all junctions oscillate in phase , the total emitted power is expected to be proportional to the square of the total number of junctions in the array .",
    "inevitable variations of junction parameters , however , may cause variations of the oscillating frequencies leading to desynchronization and dramatic drop in emission power .",
    "therefore , the major challenge is to synchronize oscillations in all junctions @xcite .",
    "one way to solve this problem is to couple the junctions with a resonant cavity .",
    "the efficient synchronization in such systems has been demonstrated experimentally @xcite and has been extensively studied in several simulation papers @xcite .",
    "demonstration of intrinsic josephson effect in high - temperature superconductors @xcite opened a completely new route to developing electromagnetic sources .",
    "layered high - temperature superconducting materials , such as bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( bscco ) , are composed of superconducting cuo@xmath2 layers coupled by josephson interaction .",
    "intrinsic josephson effect has been extensively investigated in the past decade and most `` classical '' _ ac _ and _ dc _ josephson phenomena have been observed , including fraunhofer magnetic oscillations of critical current in small - size samples @xcite , josephson plasma resonance @xcite , shapiro steps in current - voltage characteristics induced by external microwave irradiation @xcite , fiske resonances @xcite , etc .",
    "therefore a small - size mesa fabricated out of this material represents a natural one - dimensional array of josephson junctions .",
    "a large value of superconducting gap , up to 60 mev , allows to bring the josephson frequency into the practically important terahertz range . due to atomic nature of the intrinsic junctions ,",
    "it is much easier to prepare large arrays of virtually identical junctions than in the case of artificially fabricated arrays .",
    "nevertheless , the same challenge to synchronize oscillations in all junctions also remains for this system .",
    "electromagnetic waves propagate inside large - size layered superconductor in the form of plasma modes . in zero magnetic field",
    "the minimum frequency of these waves corresponding to homogeneous oscillations is given by the josephson plasma frequency .",
    "the in - plane velocity of the mode strongly depends on the c - axis wave vector , @xmath4 .",
    "the highest velocity corresponds to the in - phase mode , @xmath5 , and the lowest velocity corresponds to the antiphase mode , @xmath6 .    a stack of the intrinsic josephson junctions with lateral size smaller than the decay length of electromagnetic wave behaves as a cavity .",
    "it is characterized by a spectrum of fiske resonant modes corresponding to excitation of almost standing electromagnetic waves @xcite .",
    "frequencies of these modes strongly depend on the wave vector perpendicular to the layer direction , with the maximum frequency corresponding to the homogeneous in - phase mode in all junctions and the minimum frequency corresponding to the antiphase mode . at the stack edge",
    "the electromagnetic waves excited inside the intrinsic junctions are converted into electromagnetic waves propagating into dielectric media outside the crystal . to use the stack as a coherent source of such radiation , it would be desirable to excite the in - phase resonance mode .",
    "then the radiation power is proportional to the square of the total number of junctions positioned at distances smaller than the wavelength of radiation .",
    "however , to synchronize the intrinsic junctions one needs to have strong enough coupling between them . in the simplest case of a homogeneous stack at zero magnetic field , the josephson oscillations typically interact very weakly inside the crystal .",
    "a very popular way to achieve coherent josephson oscillations in the whole stack is to apply magnetic field along the layers .",
    "the magnetic field promotes strong inductive interaction between the neighboring junctions .",
    "large magnetic field generates a dense josephson vortex ( jv ) lattice homogeneously filling all junctions . in the case of large - size system ,",
    "interaction between the static jv arrays in neighboring junctions leads to formation of the triangular lattice corresponding to the @xmath7 phase shift between the phases in the neighboring junctions .",
    "the fiske resonances excited by the moving jv lattice have been observed experimentally @xcite . due to its triangular ground state",
    ", the jv lattice typically excites the antiphase modes .",
    "only a very weak outside radiation at double josephson frequency is expected in this case.@xcite    to achieve a powerful emission it would be desirable to prepare aligned rectangular arrangement of jvs .",
    "such configuration is expected at certain conditions in small - size mesas due to interaction with edges . at small lattice velocities transition from triangular to rectangular configuration with increasing magnetic field has been observed experimentally as a crossover from @xmath8- to @xmath9-periodic magnetic oscillations of the flux - flow voltage @xcite .",
    "the transitions between _ static _ configurations have been studied theoretically in ref .  .",
    "the possibility to have the aligned configuration at large velocities is an open issue .",
    "recent large - scale numerical simulations @xcite suggest that excitation of the resonance in - phase mode and interaction via the radiation electromagnetic field may promote alignment of jvs .    a possibility to use a mesa with small lateral size and",
    "a very large number of junctions ( about 10@xmath10 ) in zero magnetic field as a source of terahertz radiation has been proposed in ref .  .",
    "in such a design oscillations in different junctions are synchronized by the external electromagnetic radiation field generated by the oscillations themselves .",
    "small lateral size increases the strength of interaction due to the radiation field and allows to avoid excessive heating .",
    "such a source is frequency - tunable with the maximum power conversion efficiency about 30% .",
    "the obvious technological challenge of this design is a requirement to fabricate a mesa with such a large number of almost identical junctions .    in this paper",
    "we explore a different way to excite resonance mode and synchronize oscillations in a junction stack .",
    "we propose to use a stack with strongly modulated josephson critical current ( jcc ) with modulation identical in all junctions .",
    "such a modulation dramatically enhances coupling between the josephson oscillations and the in - phase resonance modes . for a single junction",
    "such a mechanism of excitation of the fiske resonances has been considered in ref .  .",
    "the frequencies of in - phase resonance modes are set by the lateral size of the mesa , @xmath11 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the c - axis dielectric constant . in particular , assuming @xmath14 , the resonance at @xmath15 thz for the fundamental mode , @xmath16 , takes place for a mesa with width 43 @xmath17 m . in the resonance a powerful almost standing wave",
    "is excited by josephson oscillations which synchronizes oscillations in the whole stack .",
    "such synchronization function of the cavity mode does not exist in a single junction.@xcite in such a design the frequency tunability in a single device is sacrificed in favor of larger power and better efficiency .",
    "we consider several specific cases of modulation , both symmetric and asymmetric , which correspond to excitation of the mode with the wavelength equal to @xmath11 and @xmath18 . for simplicity , we assume that the mesa size along the field direction , @xmath19 , is larger than the wavelength of outcoming electromagnetic wave , @xmath20 ( 0.3 mm for 1 thz ) . the calculation can be straightforwardly generalized to the opposite case @xmath21 .",
    "we calculate the i - v dependences , radiated electromagnetic power , and power conversion efficiency for such systems .",
    "recently , the resonant electromagnetic emission from the mesas fabricated out of underdoped bscco crystals has been detected experimentally @xcite .",
    "the resonance frequencies vary from 0.4 to 0.85 thz , and they increase roughly inversely proportional to the mesa widths . the origin of the observed resonances is most probably due to the mechanism described in this paper , even though no jcc modulation has been introduced deliberately . suppression of superconductivity near the edges during the fabrication process occurs to be sufficient for excitation of the resonances .",
    "one can expect that deliberately introduced jcc modulation will significantly enhance the amplitude of the resonance and radiation power .",

    "even though our voltage range is significantly lower , @xmath12 mv / junction , the heating is still expected to be significant due to the required large lateral size of the mesa . for example , for @xmath249 @xmath250[@xmath175  cm ] , @xmath46 , and @xmath251 m , 10 mw of power will be dissipated inside the mesa .",

    "<S> intrinsic josephson - junction stacks realized in mesas fabricated out of high - temperature superconductors may be used as sources of coherent electromagnetic radiation in the terahertz range . </S>",
    "<S> the major challenge is to synchronize josephson oscillations in all junctions in the stack to get significant radiation out of the crystal edge parallel to the @xmath0 axis . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest a simple way to solve this problem via artificially prepared lateral modulation of the josephson critical current identical in all junctions . </S>",
    "<S> in such a stack phase oscillations excite the in - phase fiske mode when the josephson frequency matches the fiske - resonance frequency which is set by the stack lateral size . </S>",
    "<S> the powerful almost standing electromagnetic wave is excited inside the crystal in the resonance . </S>",
    "<S> this wave is homogeneous across the layers meaning that the oscillations are synchronized in all junctions in the stack . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate behavior of the i - v characteristics and radiated power near the resonance for arbitrary modulation and find exact solutions for several special cases corresponding to symmetric and asymmetric modulations of the critical current . </S>"
