    "the standard model of elementary particle physics admits that the electron may have an electric dipole moment ( edm ) , but a darn small one ; the standard model prediction is on the order of @xmath2 e - cm , many orders of magnitude below the current experimental limit .",
    "nevertheless , in models beyond the standard model , notably super - symmetry , a larger edm is expected , sometimes tantalizingly close to the current experimental upper bounds on @xmath3 @xcite . to observe @xmath3",
    "would imply a different form of charge - conjugation / parity ( cp ) violation than the familiar form in the k- and b - meson systems .",
    "the observation of @xmath3 requires extremely large electric fields to observe the energy shift due to different alignments of @xmath3 along the quantization axis .",
    "the current upper limit on the electron edm,@xmath4 e - cm , comes from measurements in atomic thallium @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "an _ effective _ electric field is generated inside the atom .",
    "the magnitude of this electric field ( on the order of 70 mv / cm ) is far larger than the field that could be applied directly in the laboratory .",
    "this circumstance is what makes an atomic edm experiment desirable .",
    "taking this idea even further , sandars noted that the effective electric field within a molecule can be even larger than that within an atom @xcite . this insight has prompted a series of proposed and actual experiments , aimed at using molecules as high - electric - field laboratories .",
    "these experiments have employed either molecular beams or traps for neutral molecules , including molecules pbo @xcite and ybf @xcite .",
    "several others have also been proposed as viable candidates @xcite .",
    "recently , a new experiment has been proposed that may increase the experimental sensitivity to an electron edm by orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the key to this experiment is using molecular ions in lieu of neutral molecules .",
    "because ions are far easier to trap for long times than neutrals , the proposed experiment wins in terms of long coherence times .",
    "nevertheless , such an experiment poses a number of challenges , both in experimental technology and in the choice of a reasonable molecule .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to identify diatomic molecular ions that possess properties that are desirable for this experiment .",
    "for instance , the molecule should have a relatively small degeneracy of quantum mechanical states near its ground state .",
    "this feature , in a cold sample at thermal equilibrium , would ensure that most or all of the ions are already in or near a state that is useful for the edm measurement . because the number of ions in a trap is fairly small",
    ", this requirement is necessary for achieving a good signal - to - noise ratio . to meet this requirement",
    "we restrict our attention to diatomic hydrides , where the light hydrogen atom will contribute to a relatively large rotational constant .",
    "similarly , we are interested in heavy atoms with spinless isotopes in order to ensure a favorable population distribution .",
    "this requirement is an experimental one . on the theory side , isotopes with spin",
    "are useful in characterizing the accuracy of the calculations and for making empirical estimates @xcite .",
    "a second requirement is that the electric field used to polarize the molecule must be relatively small , on the order of 100 v / cm or less .",
    "this is because in the proposed experiment , the polarizing field must be rotating at mhz frequencies in order to act on the molecules without accelerating them out of the trap .",
    "lastly , we restrict ourselves to molecules that have at least one unpaired spin ( paramagnetic , i.e. molecules with @xmath5 ) , so that the net edm of the electrons does not vanish    because we confine our attention to diatomic molecules , we must meet two additional requirements : ( 1 ) a large dipole moment , on the order of 1 debye , which is not hard to achieve if the two atoms are quite different , and ( 2 ) a small energy splitting between even- and odd - parity branches of the ground state .",
    "in other words , a small omega doublet is desirable .    in general ,",
    "the size of the omega doublet is smaller for larger quantum number @xmath6 , which represents the total ( orbital plus spin ) angular momentum of the electron about the intermolecular axis .",
    "for this reason we prefer diatomic molecules with high angular momentum . in the following",
    "we consider species with @xmath1 molecular symmetry , which can support values of @xmath6 as large as @xmath7 .",
    "this choice is in sharp contrast with previous edm candidate molecules , most of which were based on @xmath8 molecular symmetries .",
    "more recently , molecular ions of @xmath9 @xcite or @xmath10 @xcite symmetry have been considered as well .    finally , the essential requirement for the molecule is that it must possess a large internal effective electric field .",
    "it is this field that acts on the electron s edm to make a measurable signal .",
    "a quick review of the relevant physics reveals why a large internal field is so important .",
    "if an electric field were applied to an atom , and if relativity did not matter , then a given electron would feel no net electric field . in equilibrium ,",
    "the applied external field would be exactly balanced by the field due to all the other charges in the atom , or else the electron would be pulled to a different equilibrium .",
    "this is the content of schiff s theorem @xcite .",
    "however , the fact that the electron can move at relativistic speeds in an atom provides a loophole around this theorem . in the relativistic case ,",
    "the electron s equilibrium is governed by the balance of electric fields , plus the motional magnetic field generated when it swings by the nucleus .",
    "thus the net electric field , by itself , can be non vanishing . by applying an external electric field , the non zero field within the molecule can be increased by a relativistic enhancement factor manifested through the mixing of @xmath11 and @xmath12 atomic states .",
    "the resulting energy shift scales with the third power of the nuclear charge , and therefore strongly favors heavy atoms as edm candidates .",
    "qualitatively , molecules can be even more effective at mixing @xmath11 and @xmath12 states of atoms than externally applied fields .",
    "indeed , in molecular orbitals it is possible for @xmath11 and @xmath12 levels to perfectly hybridize , as in the conjugated bonds of carbon - bearing molecules .",
    "the relativistic enhancement factor can be estimated from its value for the heavy atom , therefore estimating the effective internal electric field becomes a question for nonrelativistic molecular structure theory .",
    "the mixing of @xmath11 and @xmath12 atomic orbitals is useful only when it produces a molecular orbital of @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "an electron in such a molecular orbital has no orbital angular momentum about the molecular axis , and can thus penetrate close to the heavy atom s nucleus , where relativistic effects are greatest .",
    "this behavior explains why molecules with total symmetry @xmath14 have been preferred in the past .    as noted above",
    ", however , the experiment under consideration is likely constrained to molecules with _",
    "angular momentum about the axis . to accomplish these seemingly contradictory goals , we seek molecules having two valence electrons .",
    "one , of @xmath13 molecular symmetry , will be responsible for the effective electric field and consequent edm signal .",
    "the second , of @xmath15 symmetry , will allow for small omega doubling .",
    "we are thus led to contemplate molecules of @xmath16 symmetry overall .",
    "further , since @xmath15 molecular orbitals are likely to arise from @xmath17-type atomic orbitals , we seek diatomic molecules in which the heavy atom is a transition metal .",
    "previous theoretical work on heavy transition metal hydrides @xcite identifies a pair of likely molecules with low - lying @xmath18 states , namely , hfh@xmath0 and pth@xmath0 .    in the following sections we will explore the properties of these and other molecules in terms of their usefulness to an electron edm experiment . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we revisit the theoretical methods for estimating the edm signal in terms of nonrelativistic molecular wave functions and the way in which such wave functions can be constructed . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we present concrete examples of calculations for various diatomic molecules .",
    "these calculations verify that the perturbative methods we employ can semi quantitatively reproduce the effective electric fields predicted previously by more substantial calculations .",
    "in edm circles , it is customary to speak of an `` effective electric field '' experienced by the electron inside an atom or molecule .",
    "what this means in practice is that the energy shift due to an electron edm of magnitude @xmath3 is simply @xmath19 we use the letter @xmath20 to denote electric field strengths , to distinguish them from energies , denoted @xmath21 . to evaluate the energy shift ,",
    "one writes the perturbation hamiltonian in dirac notation ( @xcite , p. 254",
    "ff . ) is : @xmath22 this @xmath23 matrix acts on the state vector @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the `` upper '' and `` lower '' components of the electron s dirac wave function .",
    "each of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , in turn , stands for a two - component spinor .    in eq.([edm_ham ] ) , @xmath27 is a pauli matrix designating the electron s spin , so the combination @xmath28 describes the edm of the electron .",
    "( the direction of the electron s edm is presumed to be collinear with its magnetic moment ) .",
    "this moment interacts with the instantaneous electric field @xmath29 experienced by the electron . to a good approximation , this field",
    "is given by the coulomb field of the heavy nucleus with charge @xmath30 , @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the electron - heavy atom distance . here and throughout this paper",
    "we use atomic units , setting @xmath33 .",
    "next we denote the lower component of the electron s ground state wave function to be @xmath34",
    ". then the perturbative energy shift due to @xmath35 would be @xmath36",
    ". however , this expression vanishes for a ground - state wave function of definite parity , owing to the odd - parity of @xmath29 .",
    "thus , an externally applied electric field is required to mix states of different parities . in the important example of an atom with an s - electron ( e.g. , cs ) ,",
    "an applied electric field would create a linear combination of @xmath11 and @xmath12 states , @xmath37 higher angular momentum states are also possible in principle but do not make a substantial contribution at laboratory fields . in typical atomic edm experiments , the field is sufficiently weak to invoke the perturbative approximations : @xmath38 here @xmath39 stands for the relevant dipole operator , and the denominator denotes the energy difference between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 states .    with these approximations ,",
    "the expression for the energy shift becomes @xmath40 the factor @xmath41 incorporates the relativistic effects and can be estimated analytically using relativistic coulomb wave functions @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the fine structure constant and @xmath44 .",
    "the quantities @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the effective quantum numbers for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 states of the heavy atom , defined as the the principal quantum number shifted by a quantum defect .",
    "all values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 are obtained from ref .",
    "the constant @xmath47 is the effective nuclear charge seen by the valence electron ; for a neutral atom @xmath48 .",
    "an additional energy shift would arise from perturbations due to the @xmath49 excited state .",
    "however , the matrix element connecting the @xmath50 state to the @xmath49 state is vanishingly small , since the @xmath49 radial function has negligible amplitude near the nucleus @xcite .",
    "the energy shift of an atom in an electric field , due to the edm of the electron thus requires mixing the @xmath50 ground state and the @xmath51 excited state .",
    "the resulting energy shift is , in atomic units , @xmath52 d_e f_{\\rm applied}.\\ ] ] this expression can be viewed in two ways .",
    "one way is to envision that the atom gains an edm that is bigger than the electron s edm by the factor in square brackets in eq.([atom_shift ] ) . alternatively ,",
    "the existing electronic edm may be seen as experiencing the applied field @xmath53 , enhanced by this same factor .      in diatomic molecules ,",
    "the same kind of @xmath11-@xmath12 mixing may occur , perhaps much more substantially than in an atom @xcite .",
    "if so , the basic expression for the measured energy shift is still given by eq.([edm_shift ] ) , but the coefficients may have quite different values . to estimate these coefficients , we expand the molecular orbital wave function of the contributing electron in terms of atomic orbitals : @xmath54 here @xmath11 and @xmath12 still refer to the relevant atomic orbitals on the heavy atom , from which the edm shift will arise .",
    "but now there are other orbitals that may participate .",
    "for example , the electron wave function may have considerable contributions from @xmath17 or @xmath55 orbitals on the heavy atom or from atomic orbitals residing on the other atom .",
    "thus , in general , it may _ not _ be a good approximation that @xmath56 .",
    "nevertheless , one may seek molecules for which @xmath57 and @xmath58 are known , we can use eq.([edm_shift ] ) to find the energy shift , with the following caveat .",
    "the orbital @xmath59 here stands for the nonrelativistic @xmath12 wave function of the atom .",
    "it is therefore a linear combination of the relativistic atomic states , denoted by total spin @xmath60 : @xmath61 the factor @xmath62 emphasizes that the @xmath51 contributes with opposite signs for the two spin projections on the molecular axis , @xmath63 .",
    "as noted above , the @xmath49 orbital does not contribute to the electron edm shift ; hence the relevant matrix element reads @xmath64 thus , following flambaum @xcite and khriplovich and lamoreaux @xcite , we find the electron edm energy shift for a diatomic molecule ( in atomic units ) : @xmath65 \\frac{d_e}{ea_0}.\\ ] ]    in strong contrast to eq.([atom_shift ] ) , the molecular expression eq.([molecule_shift ] ) does _ not _ depend explicitly on the applied electric field @xmath66 .",
    "the effective electric field is simply the coefficient in front of @xmath3 .",
    "applying an external field in the laboratory is essential , however . in zero electric field ,",
    "the molecule s energy eigenstates are also eigenstates of parity @xcite : @xmath67 but separated by an energy @xmath68 referred to as the @xmath6-doubling energy . by convention , the lower ( upper ) sign of this doublet is denoted by the letter @xmath69 ( @xmath55 ) . in such a state , the electronic spin projection @xmath13 will lie along the molecular dipole moment as often as against it , canceling the energy shift .",
    "however , in a modest electric field @xmath66 , the signed values of @xmath70 are again good quantum numbers , and the expression eq.([molecule_shift ] ) is relevant",
    ". to overcome @xmath68 , the field must be large compared to a `` critical '' field , at which the stark energy overcomes the energy difference between the two parity eigenstates : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the permanent electric dipole moment of the molecule .",
    "for the proposed molecular ion experiment , it is desirable to make @xmath73 as small as possible , preferably below 100 v / cm @xcite .",
    "there remains the question of evaluating the constants @xmath74 and @xmath58 for a given molecule of interest .",
    "fortunately , it is common practice in molecular structure theory to cast molecular orbitals as linear combinations of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) .",
    "the atomic orbitals , in turn , are usefully expressed in terms of a gaussian basis set that is carefully constructed to reproduce the energy levels of the individual atoms . after decades of development , these methods are now robust and commercially available in software packages such as gaussian @xcite and molpro @xcite .",
    "we use molpro in the calculations performed here .",
    "we assume that the molecules are well - approximated by hund s angular momentum coupling case ( a ) .",
    "this approximation is justified by the much greater strength of the spin - orbit interaction and the exchange splitting ( both on the order of @xmath75@xmath76 ) as compared to rotational energies ( on the order of @xmath77 @xmath76 ) . in this case",
    "the relevant quantum numbers of each electron are its projection of orbital ( @xmath78 ) and spin ( @xmath13 ) angular momentum on the molecular axis .",
    "( in fact , strong spin - orbit mixing will impact these quantum numbers slightly , pushing the molecules toward hund s case ( c ) .",
    "we will deal with this later ) .    to make a concrete calculation , each molecular orbital",
    "is expanded in a basis set of gaussian functions , where a basis element is defined as @xmath79 here each @xmath80 is a gaussian function centered on either of the atoms in the molecule .",
    "such a set of gaussians is chosen to optimize the energies of each atom separately and is provided in one of a set of standard basis sets , referred to below . with this basis , it is now possible to define an orbital as @xmath81 and a configuration is a product of occupations of orbitals given as @xmath82 can take the values 0,1 or 2 .",
    "@xmath83 stands for anti - symmetrization .",
    "the hartree - fock ( hf ) procedure minimizes the energy of the ground state configuration , hence only one configuration is optimized .",
    "this is done by minimizing the coefficients in the orbitals and configurations .",
    "for concreteness , the configuration is @xmath84 and the procedure finds the @xmath85 and @xmath86 that minimize the total electronic energy @xmath21 . after this procedure , we perform a multi - configuration self consistent field ( mcscf ) @xcite calculation with a complete active space ( cas ) within molpro .",
    "the mcscf takes the hf @xmath21 as an initial guess and finds appropriate linear combinations of the configurations given in eq.([true_config ] ) that minimize @xmath21 over @xmath87 configurations .",
    "the @xmath87 configurations can contain many different symmetries and spin states .",
    "this wave function is @xmath88 and the procedure varies @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath86 in order to minimize the average @xmath21 .",
    "this is the time - consuming part of the calculation due to the non linear optimization routine .",
    "this step is then followed by the multi - reference configuration interaction ( mrci ) @xcite program . a mrci",
    "calculation uses the mcscf configurations and mixes in single and double excitations .",
    "the wave function is @xmath91 that minimize the value of @xmath21 for a given symmetry , subject to the constraint that the @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath86 are all fixed .",
    "therefore , deep inside the mcscf wave function is the @xmath13 molecular orbital that mixes the atomic @xmath11 and @xmath12 orbitals .",
    "we denote this orbital as @xmath92 , which has an explicit expansion into the gaussian basis functions according to eq.([true_config ] ) .",
    "analogously , the wave function for the heavy atom ( e.g. , hf@xmath0 or pt@xmath0 ) is also computed at the mcscf and mrci levels and contains atomic orbitals @xmath93 and @xmath94 expanded into the _ same _ gaussian basis set .",
    "it is now a straightforward to estimate the amplitudes @xmath95 .",
    "there are two final , but sometimes decisive , corrections .",
    "first , the desired configuration does not constitute the entire wave function , but only a fraction of it , given by its amplitude , e.g. @xmath96 in the mrci expansion in eq.([mrci ] ) .",
    "for the molecules considered in the proposed experiment , however , we have found this factor to be within several percent of unity .",
    "alternatively , it does play a crucial role in the case of pbo where the factor @xmath96 is considerably less than unity for the @xmath97 metastable state ; the state that contributes to the edm signal .",
    "more significantly , the molecular state identified in eq.([mrci ] ) may be mixed with others via spin - orbit couplings . in the case",
    "that one other molecular symmetry is mixed in , we get @xmath98 in terms of a mixing angle @xmath99 .",
    "there is no prime on the @xmath6 since spin - orbit interactions preserve the value of @xmath6 .",
    "the factor @xmath100 can be quite significant .",
    "for example , in a @xmath101 state ( as in pbf @xcite and the halides hbr@xmath0 @xcite and hi@xmath0 @xcite ) , the single valence electron would be in a @xmath102 state and would not contribute at all to an effective electric field ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "however , spin - orbit mixing with nearby @xmath104 states can introduce a @xmath13 electron , but its effective electric field is reduced by a factor of @xmath105 .",
    "this mixing is responsible for the large effective field in pbf because it has a very large spin - orbit constant .",
    "finally , we arrive at the expression used to estimate the effective electric field in our approximation : @xmath106,\\ ] ] in terms of analytical expressions and concrete features of molpro output .      in the available literature",
    ", there is no consensus as to the true ground state of pth@xmath0 @xcite ; only one paper attempts to work out the ground state of hfh@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the debate arises in pth@xmath0 concerning the ordering of the @xmath107 and @xmath1 states .",
    "therefore , we use molpro along with state - of - the - art basis sets @xcite to compute several electronic states of these molecules in addition to the @xmath1 states of interest .",
    "diatomic molecules belong to the @xmath108 point group ; however , molpro only uses abelian point groups , necessitating the use of the @xmath109 point group for our calculations . in this point group ,",
    "the projection of electronic angular momentum along the diatomic axis ( @xmath110 ) will transform as the following : @xmath111 will transform as a1 symmetry , @xmath112 as a2 , @xmath113 as b1 and @xmath114 as b2 . as a result",
    ", the full @xmath115 symmetry transforms as a1@xmath116a2 , requiring the molpro calculations to include both the a1 and a2 symmetries .",
    "the mrci @xcite calculations are performed after a mcscf @xcite calculation at various internuclear separations ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "the term `` active space '' describes the set of orbitals being used to construct the configurations , as in eq.([true_config ] ) .",
    "the active space is increased in one of two ways .",
    "one is to allow the electrons to reside in higher - lying orbitals that are nominally unoccupied .",
    "the second is to promote electrons from previously closed shells into these same orbitals .",
    "both of these options allow more parameters with which to optimize the total energy , but it comes at the expense of an increased computational burden .    the basis sets and active space sizes are bench - marked against the dissociation energies of @xcite .",

    "these curves are shown in fig.([curves_rel ] ) . performing these calculations yields values of @xmath149@xmath76 and @xmath150@xmath76 for the molecular spin - orbit constants of pth@xmath0 and hfh@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "this shift is more than enough to push the @xmath142 curve below that of the @xmath107 in pth@xmath0 ( fig.([curves_rel]a ) ) .",
    "recall that the @xmath107 state shifts little in energy because there is no spin or orbital motion , and therefore any shift in energy must be a second - order effect .",
    "the lowest @xmath7 curve is solely @xmath142 .",
    "additionally , the @xmath142 state of pth@xmath0 is well described in hund s case ( a ) ; there are no other states with @xmath7 nearby in energy ( the closest we estimate is a @xmath151 state @xmath152 30,000 @xmath76 away that dissociates to the @xmath153f limit of pt@xmath0 ) .",
    "the same results applied to hfh@xmath0 tell a different story ( fig.([curves_rel]b ) ) .",
    "the value @xmath141 is not sufficiently large to shift the @xmath143 state below the @xmath154 state .",
    "the energy difference between @xmath155 and @xmath156 states is 600 @xmath76 .",
    "there are other relativistic effects , such as the second - order correction to the spin - orbit constant and spin - spin and spin - rotation interactions , that can further push down the @xmath143 state .",
    "for example , we can estimate the second - order  spin - spin parameter in terms of the atomic spin - orbit constant in the pure - precession approximation @xcite . in these heavy elements",
    "it is the more dominant contribution to spin - spin .",
    "we find @xmath157    these contribute to an uncertainty of the an order of magnitude smaller than the energy difference in the spin - orbit - corrected curves .",
    "it is conceivable that the sum total of these other relativistic effects , acting more strongly on the @xmath1 state than on the @xmath107 state , will reverse the ordering in fig.([curves_rel]b ) . in principle",
    ", there is an uncertainty in the computed electronic energy using molpro , but this is not trivial to estimate .",
    "states more subject to relativistic effects ( like @xmath1 ) are less accurately computed compared to a @xmath107 state . more detailed calculations  or , even better , experiments  will be required to decide this issue .    if it turns out that the ground state of hfh@xmath0 is @xmath107 , then the @xmath143 state is metastable , and an estimate of its lifetime is desirable . on symmetry grounds we see that this lifetime should be very long , because of the fact that the transition would require @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "@xmath161 is the total angular momentum about the internuclear axis , @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is the mechanical rotation of the nuclei about their center of mass .",
    "the @xmath164 and @xmath6 changes are are not dipole allowed in the case ( a ) basis .",
    "however , rotational couplings do not preserve the value of @xmath6 , and spin - orbit couplings do not preserve the value of @xmath164 . because of such interactions , the molecule is not a pure hund s case ( a ) molecule .",
    "the @xmath1 states may therefore by contaminated by small amplitudes of other case ( a ) states that are dipole allowed .",
    "these are very small effects and is the reason that these terms are usually neglected in the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "for example , we can compute the amount of contamination the @xmath165 in the @xmath143 state via spin - orbit .",
    "this was done to produce the curves in fig.([curves_rel ] ) . using the eigenvectors of the case ( c ) @xmath155 functions",
    "we compute the lifetime to be ( @xmath166 ) : @xmath167 we see that lifetime is on the order of seconds .",
    "as we have seen , the electric field inside a polar diatomic molecule is independent of the applied electric field , provided that the molecule is polarized .",
    "there is a relativistic enhancement factor determined from properties of the heavy atom and a projection of the electron spin , * @xmath13 * , onto the molecular axis .",
    "now we must determine , according to our working formula eq.([real_molecule_shift ] ) , how much the @xmath11 and @xmath12 atomic orbitals are mixed because of the presence of the other atom .",
    "the values of @xmath74 and @xmath58 are obtained from the molecular structure calculations , as described above .",

    "the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and hydrogen atomic orbitals are also shown below the molecular orbital wave function .",
    "all wave functions are normalized to unity .",
    "notice that the hfh@xmath0 molecular ion in fig.([wave_functions]b ) is not as strongly mixed as in the case of pth@xmath0 .",

    "this result points to the imperative need for a complete electronic structure calculation to refine the predictions for these ions .",

    "its ground state is a toss - up between @xmath143 and @xmath154 , and its effective electric field is @xmath175 gv / cm .",
    "there remains the question of how easily polarized are the molecular states we have identified .",
    "the energy difference between states of differing parity eq.([parity ] ) in a @xmath115 state is a fourth order effect in perturbation theory provided the @xmath176 and @xmath177 electronic states are fairly well separated in energy from the @xmath178 state .",
    "brown , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have used this idea to give formulas for estimating the effect in a manner consistent with the ideas of mulliken and christy @xcite , who worked out the effect in @xmath10 states .",
    "thus , the @xmath6-doubling is relegated to finding the @xmath110-doubling ( the difference in energy between parity states comprised of @xmath179 and @xmath180 ) .    in a @xmath1 state",
    ", there are three parameters contributing to the energy splitting designated @xmath181 , @xmath182 , and @xmath183 .",
    "the parameters have the following forms @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the matrix element of the spin - orbit ( rotational ) hamiltonian between differing states .",
    "@xmath186 is an example of @xmath187 , whereas @xmath188 is an example of @xmath189 .",
    "the @xmath190 are the energy differences between the state of interest and the intermediate states .",
    "it is now straight - forward to estimate the order of magnitude of @xmath191 in the @xmath1 states .    in hfh@xmath0 , we are concerned with the @xmath155 state , governed by the @xmath192 parameter .",
    "we find @xmath191 to be ( recall that @xmath193 in the ground state ) @xmath194 this @xmath68 leads to an @xmath195 using the value of @xmath196 debye obtained via the molpro calculations .",
    "pth@xmath0 is slightly more complicated .",
    "the parameter governing its splitting is @xmath197 and connects the @xmath143 state to the @xmath142 state .",
    "so , we first find the value of the parameter and then use second - order perturbation theory within the @xmath198 manifold .",
    "thus we find ( with @xmath199 in the ground state ) that @xmath200 using @xmath201 debye in pth@xmath0 , from the molpro calculation , we find @xmath202 , which is negligible for any purpose .",
    "the @xmath1 states of pth@xmath0 and hfh@xmath0 satisfy our two most important criteria for experimental searches of the electron edm . both are easily polarized and expected to generate very high effective internal electric fields .",
    "however , several other experimentally relevant concerns remain to be resolved for these molecules , including:(1 ) whether @xmath143 is the true ground state of hfh@xmath0 ; ( 2 ) at what laser wavelengths the molecules can be probed and detected ; and ( 3 ) how their magnetic properties , e.g. , g - factors , are influenced by channel couplings engendered by electric and magnetic fields and terms neglected in the born - oppenheimer approximation ; i.e. , intermediate coupling via @xmath203 , etc .",
    "these items demand further detailed study , and will be the subject of future work .    we have endeavored to articulate a strategy for estimating the influence of the electron edm on molecular structure , using perturbation theory and nonrelativistic electronic structure calculation . this strategy has proved quite successful and should be useful to anyone wishing to assess the viability of a candidate molecule in the future .",
    "this estimate does not , of course , take the place of a complete relativistic many - electron calculation , which must be done as a follow - up .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge useful conversations with e. cornell , a. leanhardt , l. sinclair , and r. stutz and thank them for bringing the topic to our attention .",
    "we are also indebted to l. gagliardi for discussions on pth@xmath0 .",
    "erm thanks m. thompson for some useful discussions pertaining to the molpro software suite for heavy atoms .",

    "first we calculate in terms of hund s case ( a ) functions and then in terms of the single electron operators .",
    "we present the wave functions in terms of hund s case ( a ) numbers .",
    "these are presented by @xmath204 with @xmath205 . in terms of slater determinants ,",
    "the molecular wave functions are : @xmath206 once again normalizations are assumed in the determinants .",
    "the spin - orbit energy shift for the @xmath142 is then @xmath207 now we apply the total spin lowering operator ( given by @xmath208 ) to eq.([del3 ] ) to obtain the @xmath209 state .",
    "since the projection of the spin , @xmath14 , is zero , there is no shift .",
    "therefore , the molecular spin orbital constant @xmath141 as half the atomic spin - orbit constant @xmath210 .",
    "the spin - orbit parameter is the same for all states within the @xmath1 manifold .",
    "there are higher - order effects via coupling to other @xmath7 electronic states .",
    "yet , the only other @xmath7 states come from @xmath211 or @xmath212 states , which lie far off in energy . they can be evaluated to see the second - order contribution to the molecular spin - orbit constant via a calculation similar to the one below describing the coupling of @xmath213 states .",
    "off - diagonal effects of spin orbit can be evaluated using the same one - electron operators .",
    "first we write the off diagonal elements using spherical tensor notation .",
    "@xmath214 then we evaluate the coupling between eq.([del2 ] ) and eq.([pi2 ] ) . the only one electron element that works",
    "is @xmath215 to take @xmath216 to @xmath209 . only including the terms that contribute",
    ", we find @xmath217    these calculations take into account the permutations of the indices within the determinant .",
    "this is what cancels the normalization .",
    "we have ignored the effects of the other electrons in the slater determinant that belong to paired orbitals .",
    "these can , in principle , contribute via permutations of the indices and raising / lowering the angular momentum .",
