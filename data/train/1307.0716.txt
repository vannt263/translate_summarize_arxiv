    "there are good reasons for the intense activity around gapped ground states phases of quantum lattice models .",
    "theoretically as well as experimentally it has become clear that ground states of many models in condensed matter physics often have interesting structural properties even in the absence of long - range order .",
    "this structure is sometimes referred to as _ topological order _ because of striking topological effects found in some important examples @xcite .",
    "a quantum ground state phase is loosely defined as a family of models ( hamiltonians ) of which the ground states have qualitatively similar properties .",
    "the recent literature provides ample support for the following statement : for a family of hamiltonians depending on a continuous parameter in some range , @xmath3 , its ground states represent the same quantum phase if there is a positive lower bound for the spectral gap above the ground state energy independent of @xmath3 . in the opposite case , a _",
    "quantum phase transition _ may occur at a critical value of the parameter if some of the ground state properties undergo qualitative changes , and the spectral gap above the ground state necessarily vanishes at this critical value .",
    "although quantum phase transitions were already described a long time ago , for example in the xy model  @xcite or in the quantum ising model in a transverse field  @xcite , and in the monograph @xcite , the notion of a gapped ground state phase has only recently been thoroughly investigated  @xcite .",
    "the classification of symmetry - protected phases has been the subject of several studies .",
    "the result of such a classification will of course depend on the notion of equivalence that is employed . in most of the literature",
    "the manipulations preserving the equivalence of systems includes embedding the hilbert space of the original system as a subspace of the hilbert space of another system ( extending the range of degrees of freedom ) , and also tensoring with another system ( adding degrees of freedom ) @xcite .",
    "this approach has led to appealing results @xcite . in this article , however , we do not compare systems with different hilbert spaces .",
    "what we find then is a stronger invariant , meaning that our results have a greater power to predict the existence of a quantum phase transition , i.e. , the existence of at least one critical point in any parameter region between two values where the system is in two different gapped phases distinguished by different values of the invariant .    in the one - dimensional classes of examples we work out explicitly ( see the excess spin operators in section [ sec : excess ] ) , our invariant is the representation generated by unitary string operators , closely related to the string order parameters @xcite , acting on the ground states of a half - infinite chain .",
    "remarkably , these unitaries can be approximated by local observables and , hence , are in principle experimentally accessible . in a very distinct way _",
    "non - local _ unitaries can also be put to use to unravel the structure of certain symmetry - protected phases , as was first done by kennedy and tasaki in @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for several generalizations .",
    "an important consequence of the existence of a smooth interpolating path connecting two hamiltonians along which the spectral gap does not vanish , is the local automorphic equivalence @xcite of the ground state spaces of the models along the path . in @xcite",
    "we showed the existence of such a path connecting a class of generalizations of the aklt chain @xcite to a class of toy models we called pvbs hamiltonians , and emphasized the role of edge states .",
    "further physical and mathematical properties shared by models in the same phase remain largely conjectural .",
    "for example , the definition of a gapped ground state phase is expected to encapsulate the common structure of entanglement within the system , as embodied by the so - called entanglement spectrum in these systems which are expected to satisfy an area law for the entanglement entropy  @xcite .",
    "more generally , models within the same phase should exhibit the same topological order .",
    "automorphically equivalent models have the same ground state degeneracy on any lattice they can be defined on , and if a symmetry is preserved along the path , they exhibit the same pattern of symmetry breaking .",
    "moreover , models in the same phase are even expected to share a similar structure of their low - lying excitations , as for example quasi- particles with anyonic properties in the case of topologically ordered phases  @xcite .",
    "the mathematical study of these question has only just begun @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we study gapped quantum phases with symmetry , in particular a local continuous symmetry such as the invariance under spin rotations of antiferromagnetic spin chains . the assumption of a non - vanishing gap implies , under rather general conditions , that the symmetry is necessarily unbroken and consequently that the ground state does not have the associated long - range order @xcite .",
    "concretely , we will prove some implications of the automorphic equivalence of @xmath0-invariant models , where @xmath0 is a group of local symmetries of the hamiltonian .",
    "that is , we assume that the @xmath0-invariance is preserved along the paths connecting different models in what could be called the same _ symmetry - protected gapped phase _ , in analogy with the _ symmetry - protected topological order _ that may be present and detectable in such a situation @xcite .",
    "it has already been argued in  @xcite that the bulk ground state is not sufficient to describe the full range of possible phases and phase transitions even in one dimension , and that the structure of edge states carries additional information . in the presence of a symmetry which remains unbroken in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", we prove that these edge modes , namely the additional ground states that arise whenever a boundary is present , carry equivalent representations of @xmath0 within a phase .",
    "the argument is valid in any dimension and for arbitrary lattices including domains with holes or non - trivial topology .",
    "the set of these edge representations can therefore be used as a new general invariant of a gapped ground state phase .",
    "the results of section  [ sec : gtransport ] are not concerned with a particular model , but are statements about properties shared by all models within a symmetric gapped ground state phase , thereby clarifying the meaning and implications of the very notion of a phase .    in one dimension and for the special case @xmath4 ,",
    "the abstract result can be supported by the construction of an explicit ` excess spin ' operator generating the rotations of the half chain in the gns hilbert space of the bulk state .",
    "this experimentally accessible observable provides a way to measure the abstract invariant of a phase in a particular system . for models in the haldane phase , namely for integer spin antiferromagnets with a unique gapped ground state in the thermodynamic limit and exponential decay of correlations ,",
    "the existence of a half - integer edge spin is readily apparent in the aklt model and was experimentally observed in  @xcite .",
    "we show by construction that the excess spin can be approximated by local observables in two particular cases : for frustration free models having a finitely correlated ground state ( in this situation our approach works for any @xmath2 ) , and for a class of antiferromagnetic chains whose ground state has a classical random loop representation .",
    "isotropic half - integer antiferromagnetic spin chains are expected to either belong to a a gapless phase or to a dimerized phase , breaking translation invariance  @xcite .",
    "the results of this article can be applied to dimerized phases but we will not discuss the implications in detail here .",
    "similarly , the xy chain does generically not carry an interesting local symmetry except in the isotropic case in which it becomes gapless .    in section  [ sec : boundary - bulk ]",
    "we show how the abstract boundary representation and the excess spin operator are related in the case of frustration free models . in the context of frustration free spin chains with matrix product ground states we prove an exact relation between these representations and , as a consequence ,",
    "show that the representation that characterizes the edge ground state space can be determined from the correlations in the bulk .",
    "this can be seen as a simple instance of _ bulk - edge correspondence _ in the setting of quantum spin models , similar to the bulk - edge correspondence in quantum hall systems or topological insulators .",
    "we consider a quantum spin system with local hilbert space @xmath5 at each site @xmath6 . here , @xmath7 is a countable metric space , e.g. , a finite - dimensional lattice with the lattice distance as the metric .",
    "the local algebra of observables on any finite subset @xmath8 is the full matrix algebra @xmath9 and , for @xmath10 , we consider @xmath11 as a subalgebra of @xmath12 , in the natural way . for infinite @xmath7 ,",
    "the algebra of quasi - local observables , @xmath13 , is the norm completion of @xmath14 , where the union is over the finite subsets of @xmath7 . by the limit @xmath15 , we mean the limit along an increasing and absorbing sequence of finite subsets @xmath16 .",

    "first a uniform bound on the rate at which balls grow : there exist numbers @xmath17 and @xmath18 for which @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the cardinality of the ball centered at @xmath21 of radius @xmath22 .",
