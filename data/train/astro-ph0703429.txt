    "@xcite pointed out the near equality of several large fundamental dimensionless numbers of the order @xmath6 .",
    "one of these large numbers varied with time since it depended on the age of the universe .",
    "thus there was a limited time during which this near equality would hold . under the assumption that observers could exist at any time during the history of the universe , this large number coincidence",
    "could not be explained in the standard cosmology .",
    "this problem motivated @xcite and @xcite to construct an ad hoc new cosmology .",
    "alternatively , @xcite proposed that our observations of the universe could only be made during a time interval after carbon had been produced in the universe and before the last stars stop shining .",
    "dicke concluded that this temporal observational selection effect  even one so loosely delimited  could explain dirac s large number coincidence without invoking a new cosmology .    here",
    ", we construct a similar argument to address the cosmic coincidence : why just now do we find ourselves in the relatively brief interval during which @xmath7 .",
    "the temporal constraints on observers that we present are more empirical and specific than those used in dicke s analysis , but the reasoning is similar .",
    "our conclusion is also similar : a temporal observational selection effect can explain the apparent cosmic coincidence .",
    "that is , given the evolution of @xmath3 and @xmath2 in our universe , most observers in our universe who have emerged on terrestrial planets will find @xmath8 .",
    "rather than being an unusual coincidence , it is what one should expect .",
    "there are two distinct problems associated with the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "one is the coincidence problem that we address here .",
    "the other is the smallness problem and has to do with the observed energy density of the vacuum , @xmath9 .",
    "why is @xmath9 so small compared to the @xmath10 times larger value predicted by particle physics ? anthropic solutions to this problem invoke a multiverse and argue that galaxies would not form and there would be no life in a universe , if @xmath9 were larger than @xmath11 times its observed value @xcite .",
    "such explanations for the smallness of @xmath9 do not explain the temporal coincidence between the time of our observation and the time of the near - equality of @xmath2 and @xmath3 . here",
    "we address this temporal coincidence in our universe , not the smallness problem in a multiverse .",
    "given the currently observed values for @xmath12 and the energy densities @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the universe @xcite , the friedmann equation tells us the evolution of the scale factor @xmath16 , and the evolution of these energy densities .",
    "these are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : omegas ] . the history of the universe can be divided chronologically into four distinct periods each dominated by a different form of energy : initially the false vacuum energy of inflation dominates , then radiation , then matter , and finally vacuum energy .",
    "currently the universe is making the transition from matter domination to vacuum energy domination . in an expanding universe , with an initial condition @xmath17",
    ", there will be some epoch in which @xmath7 , since @xmath18 is decreasing as @xmath19 while @xmath9 is a constant ( see top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : omegas ] and appendix a ) .",
    "figure [ fig : omegas ] also shows that the transition from matter domination to vacuum energy domination is occurring now .",
    "when we view this transition in the context of the time evolution of the universe ( fig .",
    "[ fig : logproblem ] ) we are presented with the cosmic coincidence problem : why just now do we find ourselves at the relatively brief interval during which this transition happens ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite find this coincidence to be a remarkable result that is crucial to understand .",
    "the cosmic coincidence problem is often regarded as an important unsolved problem whose solution may help unravel the nature of dark energy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the coincidence problem is one of the main motivations for the tracker potentials of quintessence models @xcite .",
    "in these models the cosmological constant is replaced by a more generic form of dark energy in which @xmath2 and @xmath3 are in near - equality for extended periods of time .",
    "it is not clear that these models successfully explain the coincidence without fine - tuning ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the interpretation of the observation @xmath4 as a remarkable coincidence in need of explanation depends on some assumptions that we quantify to determine how surprising this apparent coincidence is .",
    "we begin this quantification by introducing a time - dependent proximity parameter , r = [ eq : rdef ] which is equal to one when @xmath20 and is close to zero when @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "the current value is @xmath23 . in figure",
    "[ fig : logproblem ] we plot @xmath24 as a function of log(scale factor ) in the upper panel and as a function of log(time ) in the lower panel .",
    "these logarithmic axes allow a large dynamic range that makes our existence at a time when @xmath25 , appear to be an unlikely coincidence .",
    "this appearance depends on the implicit assumption that we could make cosmological observations at any time with equal likelihood . more specifically , the implicit assumption is that the _ a priori _ probability distribution @xmath26 , of the times we could have made our observations , is uniform in log @xmath27 , or log @xmath16 , over the interval shown .",
    "our ability to quantify the significance of the coincidence depends on whether we assume that @xmath26 is uniform in time , log(time ) , scale factor or log(scale factor ) .",
    "that is , our result depends on whether we assume : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "these are the most common possibilities , but there are others . for a discussion of the relative merits of log and linear time scales and implicit uniform priors",
    "see section [ sec : measure ] and @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : linearnoproblem ] we plot @xmath32 on an axis linear in time where the implicit assumption is that the _ a priori _ probability distribution of our existence is uniform in @xmath27 over the intervals @xmath33 $ ] gyr ( top panel ) and @xmath34 $ ] gyr ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the bottom panel shows that the observation @xmath35 could have been made anytime during the past 7.8 gyr .",
    "thus , our current observation that @xmath23 , does not appear to be a remarkable coincidence . whether this most recent 7.8 gyr period is seen as `` brief '' ( in which case there is an unlikely coincidence in need of explanation ) or `` long '' ( in which case there is no coincidence to explain ) depends on whether we view the issue in log time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : logproblem ] ) or linear time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : linearnoproblem ] ) .",
    "a large dynamic range is necessary to present the fundamental changes that occurred in the very early universe , e.g. , the transitions at the planck time , inflation , baryogenesis , nucleosynthesis , recombination and the formation of the first stars .",
    "thus a logarithmic time axis is often preferred by early universe cosmologists because it seems obvious , from the point of view of fundamental physics , that the cosmological clock ticks logarithmically .",
    "this defensible view and the associated logarithmic axis gives the impression that there is a coincidence in need of an explanation .",
    "the linear time axis gives a somewhat different impression .",
    "evidently , deciding whether a coincidence is of some significance or only an accident is not easy @xcite .",
    "we conclude that although the importance of the cosmic coincidence problem is subjective , it is important enough to merit the analysis we perform here .",
    "the interpretation of the observation @xmath4 as a coincidence in need of explanation depends on the _ a priori _ ( not necessarily uniform ) probability distribution of our existence",
    ". that is , it depends on when cosmological observers can exist .",
    "we propose that the cosmic coincidence problem can be more constructively evaluated by replacing these uninformed uniform priors with the more realistic assumption that observers capable of measuring cosmological parameters are dependent on the emergence of high density regions of the universe called terrestrial planets , which require non - trivial amounts of time to form  and that once these planets are in place , the observers themselves require non - trivial amounts of time to evolve .",
    "in this paper we use the age distribution of terrestrial planets estimated by @xcite to constrain when in the history of the universe , observers on terrestrial planets can exist . in section [ sec : computeprobability ]",
    ", we briefly describe this age distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cosmologists ] ) and show how it limits the existence of such observers to an interval in which @xmath7 ( fig .",

    "we compute the probability of an observer on a terrestrial planet observing @xmath36 ( fig . [",
    "fig : pofr_nonorm ] ) .",
    "in section [ sec : robust ] we discuss the robustness of our result and find ( fig .",
    "[ fig : varyingtev ] ) that this result is relatively robust if the time it takes an observer to evolve on a terrestrial planet is less than @xmath5 gyr . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we discuss and summarize our results , and compare it to previous work to resolve the cosmic coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "the mass histogram of detected extrasolar planets peaks at low masses : @xmath37 , suggesting that low mass planets are abundant @xcite .",
    "terrestrial planet formation may be a common feature of star formation ( @xcite ) .",
    "whether terrestrial planets are common or rare , they will have an age distribution proportional to the star formation rate  modified by the fact that in the first @xmath38 billion years of star formation , metallicities are so low that the material for terrestrial planet formation will not be readily available . using these considerations , @xcite estimated the age distribution of terrestrial planets  how many earths are produced by the universe per year , per @xmath39 ( figure [ fig : cosmologists ] ) .",
    "if life emerges rapidly on terrestrial planets @xcite then this age distribution is the age distribution of biogenesis in the universe .",
    "however , we are not just interested in any life ; we would like to know the distribution in time of when independent observers first emerge and are able to measure @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as we are able to do now .",
    "if life originates and evolves preferentially on terrestrial planets , then the @xcite estimate of the age distribution of terrestrial planets is an _ a priori _ input which can guide our expectations of when we ( as members of a hypothetical group of terrestrial - planet - bound observers ) could have been present in the universe .",
    "it takes time ( if it happens at all ) for life to emerge on a new terrestrial planet and evolve into cosmologists who can observe @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , to obtain the age distribution of new independent observers able to measure the composition of the universe for the first time , we need to shift the age distribution of terrestrial planets by some characteristic time , @xmath40 required for observers to evolve . on earth , it took @xmath41 gyr for this to happen .",
    "whether this is characteristic of life elsewhere in the universe is uncertain ( @xcite ) . for our initial analysis",
    "we use @xmath42 gyr as a nominal time to evolve observers . in section",

    "@xcite estimated that the earth is relatively young compared to other terrestrial planets in the universe .",

    "the sun is more massive than @xmath80 of all stars .",
    "therefore @xmath81 of stars live longer than the @xmath82 gyr main sequence lifetime of the sun .",
    "this is mildly anomalous and it is plausible that the sun s mass has been anthropically selected .",
    "for example , perhaps stars as massive as the sun are needed to provide the uv photons to jump start and energize the molecular evolution that leads to life .",
    "if so , then @xmath5 gyr is a rough upper limit to the amount of time a terrestrial planet with simple life has to produce observers . even if the characteristic time for life to evolve into observers is much longer than @xmath83 gyr , as concluded by @xcite , this uv requirement that life - hosting stars have main sequence lifetimes @xmath84 gyr would lead to the extinction of most extraterrestrial life before it can evolve into observers",
    "this would lead to observers waking to observerhood to find the age of their planet to be a large fraction of the main sequence lifetime of their star ; the time they took to evolve would satisfy @xmath85 gyr , and they would observe that @xmath25 and that other observers are very rare .",
    "such is our situation .",
    "if we assume that we are typical observers @xcite and that the coincidence problem must be resolved by an observer selection effect @xcite , then we can conclude that the typical time it takes observers to evolve on terrestrial planets is less than @xmath86 gyr ( @xmath87 gyr ) .      the @xmath43 used here ( fig . [",
    "fig : rollercoasterzoom ] ) is based on the star formation rate ( sfr ) computed in @xcite .",
    "there is general agreement that the sfr has been declining since redshifts @xmath88 .",
    "current debate centers around whether that decline has only been since @xmath88 or whether the sfr has been declining from a much higher redshift ( @xcite ) .",
    "since @xcite assumed a relatively high value for the sfr at redshifts above 2 , this led to a relatively high estimate of the metallicity of the universe at @xmath88 , which corresponds to a relatively short delay ( @xmath38 gyr ) between the big bang and the first terrestrial planets .",
    "for the purposes of this analysis , the early - sfr - dependent uncertainty in the @xmath89 gyr delay is degenerate with , but much smaller than , the uncertainty of @xmath40 .",
    "thus the variations of @xmath40 discussed above subsume the sfr - dependent uncertainty in @xmath43 .      in figs .",
    "[ fig : logproblem ] & [ fig : linearnoproblem ] we illustrated how the importance of the cosmic coincidence depends on the range over which one assumes that the observation of @xmath24 could have occurred .",
    "this involved choosing the range @xmath90 shown on the x axis in figs . [",
    "fig : logproblem ] & [ fig : linearnoproblem ] .",
    "we also showed how the apparent significance of the coincidence depended on how one expressed that range , i.e. , logarithmic in fig .",
    "[ fig : logproblem ] and linear in fig .",
    "[ fig : linearnoproblem ] .",
    "the coincidence seems most compelling when @xmath90 is the largest and the problem is presented on a logarithmic @xmath91 axis .",
    "this dependence is a specific example of a `` measure '' problem ( @xcite ) .",
    "the measure problem is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : naivedistrib ] , where we plot four different uniform distributions of observers on a linear time axis . in panel _ a _ ) @xmath92 constant .",

    "this means for example that the probability of finding yourself between 0.1 and 1 gyr is the same as between 1 and 10 gyr .",
    "we plot this as a function of linear time and find that the distribution of observers ( dark grey ) is highest towards earlier times .    to quantify and explore these dependencies further , in table [ table : minmaxprobs ] , we take the duration when @xmath59 ( call this interval @xmath95 ) and divide it by various larger ranges @xmath90 ( a range of time or scale factor ) . thus , when the probability @xmath96 is @xmath97 , there is a low probability that one would find oneself in the interval @xmath95 and the cosmic coincidence is compelling .",

    "<S> the energy densities of matter and the vacuum are currently observed to be of the same order of magnitude : @xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> thus , we are presented with the cosmological coincidence problem : why , just now , do these energy densities happen to be of the same order ? here </S>",
    "<S> we show that this apparent coincidence can be explained as a temporal selection effect produced by the age distribution of terrestrial planets in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> we find a large ( @xmath1 ) probability that observations made from terrestrial planets will result in finding @xmath2 at least as close to @xmath3 as we observe today . </S>",
