    "complex fluids such as polymer solutions , liquid crystals , or surfactant systems are characterized by the presence of organized structures at mesoscopic scales between macroscopic and solvent molecular lengths @xcite . under the action of external forcing",
    ", the coupling between the mesoscopic structures and the local velocity field makes the flow properties of complex fluids different from those of simple liquids @xcite .",
    "for example , when a shear flow is applied to a simple fluid , after a short initial transient , the linear relation between the stress @xmath0 and the shear rate @xmath1 is verified , @xmath2 with @xmath3 being the fluid viscosity . in complex fluid an effective viscosity can be defined by the same relation but its value is not constant , depending on the strength of the applied flow . in systems with interfaces , for examples ,",
    "the effective viscosity generally decreases ( shear thinning ) when the shear rate is increased due to the alignment of interfaces with the flow .    in some cases",
    "the flow can induce new organization in the fluid @xcite . in lamellar phases , for instance , onion and hexagonal phases",
    "have been observed not existing at rest @xcite .",
    "such shear induced structures ( sis ) can coexist in a range of applied shear rates with the structures unmodified by the flow .",
    "usually the sis and the unmodified phase have different viscosities so that they flow with different profiles .",
    "this phenomenon , called shear banding , has been observed in many complex fluids and also in lamellar systems @xcite . its microscopic origin is not yet completely understood and different explanations have been proposed depending on the system @xcite .",
    "the traditional theoretical description of shear banding and other rheological behaviors in complex fluids is based on the assumption of a local relation between the stress and the shear rate @xcite .",
    "however , in this way , the role of the structures present in the fluid is not evident and they can not be directly related to the flow pattern . while a full description of the system with all its molecular dynamical variables is not possible , a description at mesoscopic level based on an order parameter evolution equation can enlighten many issues concerning the kinetics of shear banding , the morphology of the different structures in the fluid and the evolution of the flow field @xcite .",
    "since the formation of sis often occurs during transient regimes and since , also under stationary conditions , the flow pattern is not known _ a priori _ , one understands that a description based on both navier - stokes and order parameter equations is generally required .",
    "the hydrodynamical description is useful also for comparisons with experiments where not always the dynamical quantities are all easily accessible .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we want to show the relevance of the full hydrodynamical description also in systems with applied flow and see how a specific problem can be conveniently studied by our simulation methods .",
    "then we hope to clarify some aspects of the kinetics of formation of lamellar phases in cases when banded flows are observed @xcite . in our model the lamellar properties",
    "are encoded in a free - energy functional of an order parameter representing the relative concentrations of substances in the mixture .",
    "the order parameter follows a convection - diffusion equation ; from its instantaneous configurations the stress can be calculated and inserted in the navier - stokes equation without assuming a further stress - shear rate constitutive relation .",
    "the free - energy functional considered in this paper was originally introduced to study the effects of fluctuations in the disordered - lamellar phase transition @xcite and later used to describe equilibrium properties of di - block copolymer systems @xcite .",
    "solutions of copolymers , consisting of a - polymers covalently bonded to b - polymers in pairs , can organize in striped phases where a - rich and b - regions are separated by a stack of lamellae @xcite .",
    "the order parameter in this case represents the relative concentration of a and b substances .",
    "our model is also relevant for other systems with lamellar order .",
    "we mention ternary mixtures where the surfactant form interfaces between oil and water @xcite , dipolar @xcite and supercooled liquids @xcite , chemically reactive binary mixtures @xcite .",
    "the dynamical equations will be solved using a numerical scheme based on a lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) for the navier - stokes equation and finite difference methods for the convection - diffusion equation .",
    "lbm solves numerically a minimal boltzmann equation where the fluid can only move along the links of a regular lattice with dynamics consisting of a free - streaming and a collision step @xcite .",
    "lbm has been largely applied to the study of binary mixtures and complex flows @xcite .",
    "rheological behavior of liquid crystals under shear has been studied by lbm in ref .",
    "the mixed method used in this paper @xcite allows a reduction in memory which is convenient in large scale simulations . moreover , spurious terms appearing in eq .",
    "( [ motion2 ] ) @xcite are avoided and the numerical efficiency is increased .    in our simulations",
    "we start from a disordered configuration and consider the evolution of the system with parameters corresponding to the lamellar phase .",
    "this correspond to a sudden quench ; shear is applied for all the evolution after the quench .",
    "lamellae are expected to align with the flow with order propagating from the moving walls @xcite .",
    "one could think that after a sufficient long time lamellae will be ordered uniformly in the whole system .",
    "however , we will see that the system can behave differently .",
    "in some range of parameters we will find that a sis region develops in the middle of the system consisting of small droplets and pieces of bent and rolled lamellae .",
    "this region coexists with lamellar regions close to the walls and a banded flow with different shear rates is observed .",
    "these results will be discussed in relation with the traditional _ scenario _ of shear banding @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section the equilibrium model and the dynamical equations",
    "will be first introduced .",
    "then the various components of the stress and the structure factor will be defined .",
    "finally , a short review of the numerical scheme we use will be given .",
    "section iii contains our results for the evolution of the system in a specific case where a sis region with banded flow is observed .",
    "the effects of changing viscosity and shear rate on the properties of the sis region will be shown in section iv . in section",
    "v we analyze the evolution of global order in the system in the spirit of what usually done in phase separation studies , considering the behavior of the first momenta of the structure factor .",
    "a discussion with conclusions will be given in section vi .",

    "the variance corresponding to each average is also shown ; it is generally quite small indicating an uniform behavior of the system in the flow direction . at the beginning ( @xmath85 ) the shear profile is different from zero only in a region of about @xmath94 lattice sizes close to the walls ; this explains the isotropy of the configuration observed almost everywhere at this time in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . at later times",
    "the @xmath93-profile becomes characterized by two slopes found in correspondence of the regions with lamellar and sis phases .",
    "the profile remains almost stationary from @xmath95 ; the local shear rates in the lamellar and sis regions are respectively higher and lower than the imposed value .",
    "mechanical properties are described by the behavior of the two stress @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the structures present in the system locally determine the value of the chemical part of the stress .",
    "@xmath96 is larger in presence of defects or configurations which are not minima of the free - energy while it is close to zero for a well ordered lamellar configuration .",
    "this can be seen in the central part of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] where we compare the chemical stress at different distances from the walls . in the middle of the system ( @xmath98 ) the @xmath33-averaged stress reaches a maximum in correspondence of the formation of the sis and then remains different from zero .",

    "the behavior of the chemical stress at @xmath99 , just inside the sis region , is similar . on the other hand , in the region with lamellar order , at @xmath100 and @xmath101 , after a maximum at initial times , the stress relaxes to a very small value .",
    "this maximum occurs before than lamellae become aligned with the flow .",
    "this behavior is analogous to that observed in phase separation of binary mixtures under shear where the excess viscosity reaches a maximum before than domains orientate with interfaces in the direction of the flow @xcite .    the hydrodynamical stress , also shown in fig .",

    "we consider a central region of the system which includes a portion of the sis phase and the interface with the lamellar region . at @xmath85",
    "there is no evidence of the imposed flow in this part of the system ; local flows , as usually in phase segregation , originate from the defects .",

    "vortex structures , not present in the lamellar phase , can be also observed . in later pictures",
    "one observes that the sis - lamellar interface structure evolves with time together with the local flow patterns .",
    "velocity in the sis phase always remains small and a jump in the velocity magnitude can be seen moving through the sis - lamellar interface at all the late times considered .",
    "the behavior described in the previous section is found , at a given viscosity , for shear rates under a certain threshold .",
    "velocity , stress and other properties , in cases when a sis region is observed , have been checked to remain stable for long times and a linear velocity profile is never reached .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the behavior of the chemical part of the stress for two values of shear rate smaller and larger than the threshold that , for the case @xmath83 , is @xmath103 .    at @xmath104",
    "the chemical stress remains almost stationary after the formation of the sis region and the morphological evolution is similar to that shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig2 ] . on the other hand , at @xmath105 , after a maximum , the shear stress decreases to small values while the horizontal velocity tends to a profile with constant slope . in this case",
    "the sis region does not form in the middle of the system and ruptures do not occur at all in the lamellar network .",

    "with imposed shear rate this leads to a stress plateau on the flow curve ( stress _ versus _ imposed shear rate ) at @xmath108 . on the plateau , the shear rates of the different bands do not change by varying the imposed flow which only determines the relative spatial extension of the bands .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we show the shear rate profiles for different values of @xmath109 and for @xmath110 at times , for @xmath109 , when the sis phase is well formed .",
    "a central region with smaller shear rate can be clearly identified in all cases , except that for @xmath111 .",
    "the width of this region , the one with sis morphology , decreases when the imposed sear rate is increased , as usually in systems with shear banding .",
    "close to the walls the shear rate is larger than the imposed value with an almost constant value in correspondence of the region with well aligned lamellae . however ,",
    "differently from other systems with shear banding , the values of shear rates in the lamellar and in the sis regions change with the imposed flow .",
    "the constraint that the integral of the horizontal velocity in the vertical direction gives the value imposed on the boundaries is always verified .",
    "an interface of finite width between the lamellar and the sis region can be seen in all cases , confirming the relevance of the arguments discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the behavior of the hydrodynamical , chemical and total stress is shown in fig .  [ fig8 ] as a function of the imposed shear rate . the total stress does not exhibit a flat regime in the interval where the sis phase exists and changes in the behavior are not observed when @xmath1 becomes greater than @xmath112 . as expected , the chemical stress decreases with the reduction of the width of the sis region .    finally , we examine the effects of viscosity showing results at fixed shear rate for times after the sis formation .",
    "the main result is that at higher viscosities the width of the sis region becomes narrower , as shown in fig .",
    "this behavior is confirmed from fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] where shear rate profiles are plotted .",
    "we have tried to interpret these results considering possible relations between cases with a sis region and characteristic time scales of the imposed flow .",
    "the shear rate naturally introduces a typical time @xmath113 when shear effects are expected to become relevant @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the propagation of the horizontal velocity from the moving walls requires a relaxation time which , in simple fluids , is inversely proportional to the viscosity @xcite .",
    "this time is also relevant for the effectiveness of the imposed flow in the middle of the system .",
    "we did not find a quantitative explanation of the phenomena before described in terms of these time scales , probably , also because the relaxation time of a simple fluid is not appropriate for the system we are studying .",
    "however , our results suggest the following general qualitative observation . if shear effects arrive early enough in the middle of the system , due to a large shear rate or to a high viscosity , the flow is able to penetrate in this region and lamellae align with it . otherwise , at lower shear rates or lower viscosity , a sis region can be found .",
    "we will return on this point in the discussion of the last section .",
    "in cases without imposed flows , the kinetics of formation of ordered phases after a quench is a process which is well - known for simple systems like binary mixtures , and still under investigations for lamellar systems . in binary mixtures dynamical",
    "scaling occurs with domains growing isotropically with power - law behavior @xcite . in lamellar systems",
    "the formation of extended defects or grain boundaries between domains of differently oriented lamellae characterizes the late time evolution ; other defects like dislocations and disclinations are also present @xcite .",
    "typical lengths can be defined and their evolution follow power - law or slower asymptotic growth depending on the steepness of the potential energy and on the depth of the quench . in cases with power - law behavior the length corresponding to the inverse of the structure factor at half height grows with an exponent ranging in the interval @xmath114 @xcite .    in our case with shear",
    "the presence of banded structures makes problematic the description of ordering in terms of a single length , as we have seen in the previous sections .",
    "however , it could still be interesting to consider the behavior of averaged lengths intended as macroscopic indicators of the degree of order in the system .",

    "[ fig11 ] the evolution of @xmath116 for different viscosities and shear rates . in all cases",

    "in particular , keeping the viscosity @xmath21 fixed , we found that the value of @xmath119 increases by increasing the shear rate @xmath1 . in the case discussed in section iii with @xmath120",
    "it results that @xmath121 for times @xmath122 corresponding to sis formation ; the later growth is characterized by the elimination of local defects in the lamellar region .",
    "finite size effects may affect the behavior of @xmath118 at very late times .",
    "the case not shown in fig .  [ fig11 ] with @xmath104 and the same viscosity @xmath123 is similar .",
    "the time interval corresponding to the sis formation ( @xmath124 ) is characterized by a growth compatible with exponent @xmath125 while the growth rate changes later . by increasing",
    "further the shear rate ( @xmath106 ) , banded configurations do not form ( see figs .",
    "[ fig5]-[fig6 ] ) and the whole system reaches a lamellar order with exponent @xmath126 .",
    "the behavior at @xmath104 and @xmath127 is qualitatively similar to those already discussed ; the difference is in the value of the growth rate which is now @xmath128 during the sis formation .",
    "we observe that this value is greater than in the case with the lower viscosity @xmath123 . finally , for the highest value of viscosity shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , a power law appears not appropriate for describing the behavior of @xmath118 .",
    "we can conclude that the growth of lamellar order as measured by @xmath118 is faster for parameters corresponding to a smaller extension of the sis region and a larger lamellar phase .",
    "in this paper we have shown results from two - dimensional simulation results for a fluid mixture quenched from a disordered configuration into a state with lamellar order .",
    "the fluid , described by navier - stokes and convection - diffusion equations , is subject during all the evolution to the action of a shear flow imposed by the walls of the system .",
    "the ordering process of a lamellar system , in absence of flow , would be characterized by the presence of local and extended defects that make slow , sometimes freezing , the evolution of the system .",
    "when shear is applied , defects tend to be eliminated and lamellae would be expected to align in a preferred direction forming well - ordered macroscopic domains .",
    "our results actually show that different evolutions with more complex morphologies are also possible under shear . for small enough shear rates and viscosities we found that the flow stabilizes itself with a horizontal velocity profile characterized by two different slopes .",
    "close to the walls the shear rate is higher than the imposed one and well - ordered lamellae can be observed . in the central part of the system , that is reached later by the flow , the shear rate is smaller than the imposed one and the morphology of domains is characterized by the presence of small droplets and pieces of bent or rolled lamellae never aligned with the flow .",
    "we referred to this region as to a sis phase .",
    "shear banding phenomena occur in many complex fluids .",
    "similarly to what generally found , in our case the width of the sis phase decreases by increasing the value of the imposed shear rate . in other important aspects , however , our results differ from the usual picture of shear banding . in the range of shear rates with coexisting lamellar and sis regions ,",
    "we do not observe a plateau of the total stress at varying shear intensity .",
    "moreover , in this range , the values of local shear rates corresponding to the two phases depend on the imposed flow .    at the moment",
    ", we are not aware of experiments with the same scenario as that described in this paper . however , even if our model can be appropriately used for studying copolymer systems in the weak segregation limit @xcite , the comparison with experiments is limited from the fact that our simulations are two - dimensional while in three - dimensional systems more complex geometries can occur @xcite , with possible different rheological behaviors and flow patterns . actually , the purpose of this work was more generic .",
    "we wanted to analyze general features of the formation of banded flows in systems with lamellar order considering the full dynamical problem for the velocity and the concentration fields .",
    "our results of section iii and iv show that when the applied flow is weak enough or propagates from the walls sufficiently slowly ( at lower viscosities ) , it is not able to penetrate with the same shear rate in all the system . in this case",
    "the central region , with its intertwined tangled lamellae , opposes to the presence of the flow and tends to keep its morphology .",
    "the region tends to behave as an almost frozen network ; the shear mainly acts stressing this network and causing ruptures with the production of droplets and small pieces of lamellae .",
    "even if the shear rate in the sis region is quite small but not zero , the behavior of our system resembles that of yield stress fluids where no flowing steady states exist for stresses under a certain threshold @xcite . for example , in soft glass systems , coexistence between not flowing `` pasty '' states and sheared fluid regions has been observed @xcite . in relation with this , it is interesting to observe that an equilibrium glass transition has been found also in systems with lamellar order @xcite .",
    "we think that in our case the competition between the intrinsic slow dynamics @xcite and the acceleration induced by the external flow is responsible for the peculiar shear banding phenomena we have shown .",
    "finally , we observe that our numerical methods have been proven to be quite convenient for simulating fluids with complex order under driving forces .",
    "these methods can be implemented also with different geometries and in the more realistic three - dimensional case .",
    "we hope that our two - dimensional results can be useful for the comprehension of shear banding and stimulating for new experiments .",

    "<S> close to the walls the system reaches a lamellar order with very few defects and the slope of the horizontal velocity is higher than the imposed shear rate . in the middle of the system the local shear rate is lower than the imposed one and the system looks as a mixture of tilted lamellae , droplets and small elongated domains . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to this as to a region with a shear induced structures ( sis ) configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the local behavior of the stress shows that the system with the coexisting lamellar and sis regions is in mechanical equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon occurs , at fixed viscosity , for shear rates under a certain threshold ; when the imposed shear rate is sufficiently large , lamellar order develops in the whole system . </S>",
    "<S> effects of different viscosities have been also considered : the sis region is observed only at low enough viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the above _ scenario _ with the usual one of shear banding . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we do not find evidence for a plateau of the stress at varying imposed shear rates in the region with banded flow . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret our results as due to a tendency of the lamellar system to oppose to the presence of the applied flow . </S>"
