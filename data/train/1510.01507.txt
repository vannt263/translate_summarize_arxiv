    "simulation of granular matter is important for increased understanding of the nature of granular media and as an engineering tool for design , control and optimization of processing and transportation systems @xcite . with the discrete element method ( dem ) the material is modeled as a system of contacting rigid bodies , referred to as particles in this text .",
    "this provides detailed information about force structures and particle kinematics on a microscopic level .",
    "dem accurately capture many of the characteristic phenomena of granular media - for instance jamming , dilatancy , emergence of strong force chains , strain localization , avalanches and size - segregation upon fluidization - that are difficult or even impossible to model with continuum based methods . the required computational time increase with the number of bodies and this limit the practical use of dem for exhaustive simulation studies of large - scale systems and large parameter spaces .",
    "one strategy to remedy this is to increase the computational performance by use of parallel algorithms and dedicated hardware .",
    "another strategy is the use of implicit integration with large time - step using the nonsmooth dem ( ndem ) @xcite , also known as the contact dynamics method @xcite , where velocities may be time - discontinuous and impulses can propagate instantly through the system .",
    "a third strategy , that is pursued in the paper , is to reduce the computational complexity by identifying regions in the granular media where the particles may be substituted by approximate models with less degrees of freedom .",
    "model order reduction is well established and widely used for reducing the computational complexity in solid and fluid mechanics , dynamical systems and control theory @xcite . in multibody dynamics , it is often used for reducing the degrees of freedom of flexible bodies @xcite while the number of multibodies are preserved .",
    "there are few examples that resemble model order reduction for the discrete element method .",
    "glssmann @xcite applied the karhunen - love transform to clusters of discrete elements that show dynamic coherence to reduce the order of generalized coordinates . in the combined finite - discrete element method ( fdem )",
    "each body is represented as a discrete element that is also discretized by a finite element method @xcite .",
    "the bodies may deform , fracture and fragment indefinitely into smaller elements based on the internal stresses .",
    "an inversion of this is the hierarchical multiscale modeling of granular media discretized by a coarse mesh of finite elements in combination with assemblies of fine grained discrete elements for numerical computation of the local constitutive law for the finite element computations @xcite .",
    "a two - scale and two - method approach for modeling granular materials is presented in @xcite , where dem is used for domains of large and discontinuous deformations and as an elastoplastic solid using fem in continuous domains .",
    "automatic simplification algorithms of articulated multibody systems have been developed and shown to increase computational performance by two orders in magnitude on large - scale linkage systems @xcite .",
    "dynamic formation of both rigid aggregates ( clumped particles ) and elastic aggregates ( clustered particles ) , are supported by several discrete element codes and is used for modeling grains in brittle rock @xcite .",
    "the idea is to identify regions of the granular media that collectively move as rigid bodies and substitute each of these regions with rigid aggregates of the corresponding shape and mass distribution",
    ". particles and rigid aggregates may also merge with rigid bodies or kinematic geometries that do not represent granular media , for instance the particles in an excavator bucket may merge with the bucket into one single rigid body .",
    "the aggregated rigid bodies still contribute to the system dynamics but require only a few degrees of freedom .",
    "when merged material is disturbed , by a change in external forces or boundary contacts , it may split into smaller constituents that are either rigid aggregates of fewer particles or single particles .",
    "the complexity of systems with granular media in the solid state is thus largely reduced and the computational performance increase correspondingly while the macroscopic dynamics may be preserved . for granular media in the gaseous or liquid state ,",
    "on the other hand , a model reduction into rigid aggregates will cause significant errors .",
    "this paper is limited to model reduction into rigid bodies .",
    "the extension to elastoplastic bodies can be imagined but is beyond the current scope .",
    "the ultimate goal is to achieve optimal trade - off between : maximum system reduction ; minimum errors on the macroscopic dynamics ; minimum computational overhead .",
    "the main challenge is to predict when and where merged material should be refined , or split .",
    "most real systems are in a combination of the three states of granular media : solid , fluid and gas @xcite . if the split conditions are too restrictive , or the merge condition too progressive , the bulk properties become wrong .",
    "this may appear as incorrect angle of repose , artificial resistance to compression and shearing forces and erroneous rheology in the fluid state .",
    "if the split conditions are too permissive , or the merge conditions too strict , most particle will remain free and the there is no computational gain .",
    "also , the computational overhead of model reduction must be small in comparison to the computational time for the fully resolved system .",
    "the idea is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration ] with an excavator digging in a bed of granular material .",
    "only a finite domain of the material around the bucket is displaced and need to be simulated dynamically .",
    "the remaining part is static and contribute merely with supporting contact pressure .",
    "when the bucket is filled and starts to lift , most material co - move rigidly with the bucket .",
    "if the purpose of the simulation is to compute the dynamics of the excavator and the load forces in the mechanism , the material and the bucket can be approximated by a single rigid body .",
    "when the bucket accelerates or rotate slowly the force distribution in the granular material change and it might start to flow . several methods for predicting splitting of the rigid aggregates are proposed and tested in numerical experiments .",
