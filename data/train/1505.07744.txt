    "the last decades have witnessed a revolution in science , thanks to the appearance of the concept of _ complex systems _ : systems that are composed of a large number of interacting elements , and whose interactions are as important as the elements themselves @xcite . in order to study the structures created by such relationships ,",
    "several tools have been developed , among which _ complex networks theory _",
    "@xcite , a statistical mechanics understanding of graph theory , stands out .",
    "complex networks have been used to characterise a large number of different systems , from social @xcite to transportation ones @xcite .",
    "they have also been valuable in the study of brain dynamics , as one of the greatest challenges in modern science is the characterisation of how the brain organises its activity to carry out complex computations and tasks .",
    "constructing a complete picture of the computation performed by the brain requires specific mathematical , statistical and computational techniques . as",
    "brain activity is usually complex , with different regions coordinating and creating temporally multi - scale , spatially extended networks , complex networks theory appears as the natural framework for its characterisation .",
    "when complex networks are applied to brain dynamics , nodes are associated to sensors ( _ e.g. _ measuring the electric and magnetic activity of neurons ) , thus to specific brain locations , and links to some specific conditions .",
    "for instance , brain functional networks are constructed such that pairs of nodes are connected if some kind of synchronisation , or correlated activity , is detected in those nodes - the rationale being that a coordinated dynamics is the result of some kind of information sharing @xcite .",
    "once these networks are reconstructed , graph theory allows endowing them with a great number of quantitative properties , thus vastly enriching the set of objective descriptors of brain structure and function at neuroscientists disposal .",
    "this has especially been fruitful in the characterisation of the differences between healthy ( control ) subjects and patients suffering from neurologic pathologies @xcite .",
    "once the topology ( or structure ) of a network has been described , a further question may be posed : can such topology be explained by a set of simple generative rules , like a higher connectivity of neighbouring regions , or the influence of nodes physical position ? when a set of rules ( a _ generative model _ ) has been defined , it has to be optimised and validated : one ought to obtain the best set of parameters , such that the networks yielded by the model are topologically equivalent to the real ones .",
    "this usually requires maximising a function of the @xmath0-values representing the differences between the characteristics of the synthetic and real networks . in spite of being accepted as a standard strategy",
    ", this method presents several drawbacks .",
    "first , its high computational complexity : large sets of networks have to be created and analysed for every possible combination of parameters ; and second , its unfitness for assessing the presence of multiple local minima .    in this contribution",
    ", we propose the use of _ probabilistic constraint programming _ ( pcp ) for characterising the space created by the parameters of a generative model , _",
    "i.e. _ a space representing the distance between the topological characteristics of real and synthetic networks .",
    "we show how this approach allows recovering a larger quantity of information about the relationship between model parameters and network topology , with a fraction of the computational cost required by other methods .",
    "additionally , pcp can be applied to single subjects ( networks ) , thus avoiding the constraints associated with working with a large and homogeneous population .",
    "we further validate the pcp approach by studying a simple generative model , and by applying it to a data set of brain activity of healthy people .",
    "the remainder of the text is organised as follows .",
    "besides this introduction , sections [ sec : cp ] and [ sub : probabilistic - constraint - program ] respectively review the state of the art in constraint programming and its probabilistic version .",
    "afterwards , the application of pcp is presented in section [ sec : results ] for a data set of brain magneto - encephalographic recordings , and the advantages of pcp are discussed in section [ sec : comparing ] .",
    "finally , some conclusions are drawn in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "a constraint satisfaction problem @xcite is a classical artificial intelligence paradigm characterised by a set of variables and a set of constraints , the latter specifying relations among subsets of these variables .",
    "solutions are assignments of values to all variables that satisfy all the constraints .",
    "constraint programming is a form of declarative programming , in the sense that instead of specifying a sequence of steps to be executed , it relies on properties of the solutions to be found that are explicitly defined by the constraints .",
    "a constraint programming framework must provide a set of constraint reasoning algorithms that take advantage of constraints to reduce the search space , avoiding regions inconsistent with the constraints .",
    "these algorithms are supported by specialised techniques that explore the specificity of the constraint model , such as the domain of its variables and the structure of its constraints .",
    "continuous constraint programming @xcite has been widely used to model safe reasoning in applications where uncertainty on the values of the variables is modelled by intervals including all their possibilities .",
    "a continuous constraint satisfaction problem ( ccsp ) is a triple @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a tuple of @xmath3 real variables @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a cartesian product of intervals @xmath6 ( a box ) , each @xmath7 being the domain of variable @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is a set of numerical constraints ( equations or inequalities ) on subsets of the variables in @xmath2 .",
    "a solution of the ccsp is a value assignment to all variables satisfying all the constraints in @xmath9 .",
    "the feasible space @xmath10 is the set of all ccsp solutions within @xmath5 .",
    "continuous constraint reasoning relies on branch - and - prune algorithms @xcite to obtain sets of boxes that cover exact solutions for the constraints ( the feasible space @xmath10 ) .",
    "these algorithms begin with an initial crude cover of the feasible space ( the initial search space , @xmath5 ) which is recursively refined by interleaving pruning and branching steps until a stopping criterion is satisfied .",
    "the branching step splits a box from the covering into sub - boxes ( usually two ) .",
    "the pruning step either eliminates a box from the covering or reduces it into a smaller ( or equal ) box maintaining all the exact solutions .",
    "pruning is achieved through an algorithm  @xcite that combines constraint propagation and consistency techniques  @xcite : each box is reduced through the consecutive application of narrowing operators associated with the constraints , until a fixed - point is attained .",
    "these operators must be correct ( do not eliminate solutions ) and contracting ( the obtained box is contained in the original ) . to guarantee such properties ,",
    "interval analysis methods are used .",
    "interval analysis @xcite is an extension of real analysis that allows computations with intervals of reals instead of reals , where arithmetic operations and unary functions are extended for interval operands .",
    "for instance , @xmath11+[3,7]$ ] results in the interval @xmath12 $ ] , which encloses all the results from a point - wise evaluation of the real arithmetic operator on all the values of the operands . in practice",
    "these extensions simply consider the bounds of the operands to compute the bounds of the result , since the involved operations are monotonic . as such",
    ", the narrowing operator @xmath13 may be associated with constraint @xmath14 to prune the domain of variable @xmath15 based on the domains of variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "similarly , in solving the equation with respect to @xmath16 and @xmath17 , two additional narrowing operators can be associated with the constraint , to safely narrow the domains of these variables . with this technique , based on interval arithmetic ,",
    "the obtained narrowing operators are able to reduce a box @xmath18\\times[3,7]\\times[0,5]$ ] into @xmath19\\times[3,4]\\times[4,5]$ ] , with the guarantee that no possible solution is lost .      in classical ccsps",
    ", uncertainty is modelled by intervals that represent the domains of the variables .",
    "constraint reasoning reduces uncertainty , providing a safe method for computing a set of boxes enclosing the feasible space .",
    "nevertheless this paradigm can not distinguish between different scenarios , and all combination of values within such enclosure are considered equally plausible . in this work",
    "we use probabilistic constraint programming @xcite , which extends the continuous constraint framework with probabilistic reasoning , allowing to further characterise uncertainty with probability distributions over the domains of the variables .    in the continuous case , the usual method for specifying a probabilistic model",
    "@xcite assumes , either explicitly or implicitly , a joint probability density function ( p.d.f . ) over the considered random variables , which assigns a probability measure to each point of the sample space @xmath20 .",
    "the probability of an event @xmath21 , given a p.d.f .",
    "@xmath22 , is its multidimensional integral on the region defined by the event : @xmath23    the idea of probabilistic constraint programming is to associate a probabilistic space to the classical ccsp by defining an appropriate density function .",
    "a probabilistic constraint space is a pair @xmath24 , where @xmath1 is a ccsp and @xmath22 is a p.d.f .",
    "defined in @xmath25 such that : @xmath26 .",
    "a constraint ( or a conjunction of constraints ) can be viewed as an event @xmath21 whose probability can be computed by integrating the density function @xmath22 over its feasible space as in equation ( [ eq : prob - event ] ) .",
    "the probabilistic constraint framework relies on continuous constraint reasoning to get a tight box cover of the region of integration @xmath21 , and computes the overall integral by summing up the contributions of each box in the cover .",
    "generic quadrature methods may be used to evaluate the integral at each box .    in this work , monte carlo methods @xcite are used to estimate the value of the integrals at each box .",
    "the integral can be estimated by randomly selecting @xmath27 points in the multidimensional space and averaging the function values at these points .",
    "this method displays @xmath28 convergence , _",
    "i.e. _ by quadrupling the number of sampled points the error is halved , regardless of the number of dimensions .",
    "the advantages obtainable from this close collaboration between constraint pruning and random sampling were previously illustrated in ocean colour remote sensing studies @xcite , where this approach achieved quite accurate results even with small sampling rates .",
    "the success of this technique relies on the reduction of the sampling space , where a pure non - nave monte carlo ( adaptive ) method is not only hard to tune , but also impractical in small error settings .",
    "in order to validate the use of pcp for analysing the parameters space of a generative models , here we consider a set of magneto - encephalographic ( meg ) recordings .",
    "a series of preliminary steps are required , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] . first",
    ", starting from the left , real brain data ( or data representing any other real complex system ) have to be recorded and encoded in networks , then transformed into a set of topological ( structural ) features . in parallel , as depicted in the right part , a generative model has to be defined : this allows to generate networks as a function of the model parameters , and extract their topological features .",
    "finally , both features should be matched , _",
    "i.e. _ the model parameters should be optimised to minimise the distance between the vectors of topological features of the synthetic and real networks .",
    "magneto - encephalographic ( meg ) scans were obtained for @xmath29 right handed elderly and healthy participants , recruited from the geriatric unit of the hospital universitario san carlos madrid and the centro de prevencin del deterioro cognitivo , ayuntamiento de madrid , spain . before the task execution , all participants or legal representatives gave informed consent to participate in the study .",
    "the study was approved by the local ethics committee .",
    "brain activity scans correspond to a modified version of the sternberg s letter - probe task @xcite , a standard task used to evaluate elders memory proficiency .",
    "meg signals were recorded with a @xmath30 hz sampling rate , using @xmath31-channel whole head magnetometer , confined in a magnetically shielded room ( msr ) . @xmath32 artefact - free epochs were randomly chosen from those corresponding to correct answers for each of participant .      following the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] , meg recordings are converted in functional networks .",
    "nodes , corresponding to meg sensors and therefore to different brain regions , are pairwise connected when some kind of common dynamics is detected between the corresponding time series .",
    "such relationship is assessed through synchronization likelihood ( sl ) @xcite , a metric able to detect _ generalised synchronisation _ , _",
    "i.e. _ situations in which two time series react to a given input in different , yet consistent ways @xcite .",
    "it thus goes beyond simple linear correlations , as it is able to detect non - linear and potentially chaotic relations . applying sl yields a correlation matrix @xmath33 of size @xmath34 ( the number of sensors in the meg machine ) for each epoch available . in order to filter any kind of transient or noise specific to one epoch ,",
    "the @xmath32 matrices corresponding to each subjects have been averaged : the final result is then a single weight matrix @xmath35 for each subject .",
    "while a correlation matrix can readily be interpreted as a weighted fully - connected network , few metrics are available to describe the structure of such objects .",
    "it is then customary to apply a threshold , _",
    "i.e. _ discard all links whose weight is not significant , and thus obtain an unweighted network .",
    "this presents several advantages .",
    "first of all , brain networks are expected to be naturally sparse , as increasing the connectivity implies a higher physiological cost .",
    "furthermore , low synchronisation values may be the result of statistical fluctuations , _",
    "e.g. _ of correlated noise ; in such cases , deleting spurious links can only improve the understanding of the system .",
    "lastly , a pruning can also help deleting indirect , second order correlations , which do not represent direct dynamical relationships .",
    "the final step involves the calculation of the topological metrics associated to each pruned network , _",
    "i.e. _ the @xmath22s of fig . [ fig:01 ] .",
    "two have here been considered , representing two complementary aspects of brain information processing ; their selection has been motivated by the generative model used afterwards ( see section [ sec : model ] ) :    clustering coefficient . : :    the _ clustering coefficient _ , also known as _ transitivity _ , measures    the presence of triangles in the network @xcite .",
    "mathematically , it    is defined as the relationship between the number of triangles and the    number of connected triples in the network :    @xmath36 . here",
    ", a triangle is a    set of three nodes with links between each pair of them , while a    connected triple is a set of three nodes where each one can be reached    from each other ( directly or indirectly ) . from a biological point of    view , the clustering coefficient represents how brain regions are    locally connected , creating dense communities computing some    information in a collaborative way . efficiency .",
    ": :    it is defined as the inverse of the harmonic mean of the length of the    shortest paths connecting pairs of nodes @xcite :    +    @xmath37    +    @xmath38 being the distance between nodes @xmath39    and @xmath40 , _",
    "i.e. _ the number of jumps required to travel    between them . a low value of @xmath41 implies that all brain    regions are connected by short paths .",
    "it has to be noticed how these two measures are complementary , the clustering coefficient and efficiency respectively representing the _ segregation _ and _ integration _ of information @xcite .",
    "additionally , both @xmath9 and @xmath41 are here defined as a function of the threshold @xmath42 applied to prune the networks - their evolution is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig:02 ] .          jumping to the right side of fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] , it is now necessary to define a generative model . as an example , we have here implemented a _ economical clustering model _ model as defined in @xcite .",
    "given two nodes @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the probability of creating a connection between them is given by :    @xmath43    @xmath44 is the number of neighbours common to @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and @xmath45 is the physical distance between the two nodes .",
    "this model thus includes two different forces that compete to create links .",
    "on one side , @xmath46 controls the appearance of triangles in the network , by positive biasing the connectivity between nodes having nearest neighbours in common ; it thus defines the clustering coefficient and the appearance of computational communities . on the other side , @xmath47 accounts for the distance in the connection , such that long - range connections , which are biologically costly , are penalised .",
    "the problem is now identifying the best values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 that permit recovering the topological properties obtained in sec . [",
    "sec : reconstr ] for the experimental brain networks . as an example of a standard @xmath0-value based mechanism , we here use a simplified version of the energy function proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite :    @xmath48    @xmath49 represents the @xmath0-value of the kolmogorov - smirnoff ( k - s ) test between the distributions estimated from the model and experimental networks , and @xmath39 runs over all topological metrics . as just two topological properties are here studied , the previous formula simplifies to : @xmath50    for each considered value of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , a set of networks have been generated according to the model of eq .",
    "[ eq : economicalclustering ] ; their topological features extracted ; and the resulting probability distribution compared with the distribution corresponding to the real networks , through a k - s test .",
    "[ fig:03 ] presents the result of plotting the energy evolution in the parameters space .",
    "specifically , fig .",
    "[ fig:03 ] left reports the evolution of the energy for a link density of @xmath51 . it can be noticed that a large portion of the space , constructed around the values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 suggested in @xcite , maximises the energy . fig .",
    "[ fig:03 ] right represents the same information for ten different link densities , from @xmath52 ( bottom part ) to @xmath53 ( upper part ) .      as an alternative solution ,",
    "the previously described pcp method is here used to recover the shape of the parameters space .",
    "two preliminary steps have to be completed : first , reconstruct a set of synthetic networks using the generative model of eq .",
    "[ eq : economicalclustering ] , for different @xmath46 and @xmath47 values , and extract their topological characteristics ; and second , obtain approximated functions describing the evolution of the topological metrics as a function of the model parameters , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "afterwards , each observed feature @xmath56 is modelled as a function @xmath57 of the model parameters plus an associated error term @xmath58 : @xmath59    for @xmath3 observations , a probabilistic constraint space is considered with random variables @xmath46 and @xmath47 , a set of constraints @xmath9 , @xmath60 @xmath61 being chosen to keep the error within reasonable bounds , and the joint p.d.f .",
    "@xmath22 , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the normal distribution with @xmath64 mean and standard deviation @xmath65 .    to compute the probability distribution of the random variables @xmath46 and @xmath47 , a grid",
    "is constructed over their domains and a branch - and - prune algorithm is initially used to obtain a grid box cover of the feasible space ( where each box belongs to a single grid cell ) .",
    "then , for each box in the cover , a monte carlo method is used to compute its contribution to equation ( [ eq : prob - event ] ) with the p.d.f .",
    "defined in equation ( [ eq : error - pdf ] ) .",
    "the probability of the respective cell is updated accordingly and normalised in end of the process .",
    "[ fig:04 ] reports the results obtained , _",
    "i.e. _ the probability of obtaining networks with the generative model which are compatible with the real ones , as a function of the two parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and as a function of the link density . in the next section , both approaches and their results are compared .",
    "results presented in sec . [ sec : par_std ] and [ sec : par_pcp ] allow comparing the @xmath0-value and pcp methods , and highlight the advantages that the latter presents over the former .    the extremely high computational cost of analysing the parameters space by means of k - s tests seldom allows a full characterisation of such space .",
    "this is due to the fact that , for any set of parameters , a large number of networks have to be created and characterised . increasing the resolution of the analysis , or enlarging the region of the space considered , increases the computational cost in a linear way .",
    "this problem is far from being trivial , as , for instance , the networks required to create fig . [ fig:03 ] represents approximatively @xmath66 gb of information and several days of computation in a standard computer .",
    "such computational cost implies that it is easy to miss some important information .",
    "let us consider , for instance , the result presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:03 ] left .",
    "the shape of the iso - lines suggests that the maximum is included in the region under analysis , and that no further explorations are required - while figs .",
    "[ fig:04 ] and [ fig:05 ] prove otherwise .    on the other hand ,",
    "estimating the functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 requires the creation and analysis of a constant number of networks , independently on the size of the parameters space .",
    "the total computational cost drops below the hour in a standard computer , implying a 3 orders of magnitude reduction .",
    "this has important consequences on the kind of information one can obtain .",
    "[ fig:05 ] left presents the same information as fig .",
    "[ fig:03 ] left , but calculated by means of pcp over a larger region .",
    "it is then clear that the maximum identified in fig .",
    "[ fig:03 ] is just one of the two maxima presents in the system .",
    "the second important advantage is that , while the pcp can yield results for just one network or subject , a @xmath0-value analysis requires a probability distribution .",
    "it is therefore not possible to characterise the parameters space for just one subject , but only for a large population .",
    "[ fig:05 ] right explores this issue , by showing the probability evolution in the parameters space for six different subjects .",
    "it is interesting to notice how subjects are characterised by different shapes in the space .",
    "this allows a better description of subjects , aimed for instance at detecting differences among them .",
    "in this contribution , we have presented the use of probabilistic constraint programming for optimising the parameters of a generative model , aimed at describing the mechanisms responsible for the appearance of some given topological structures in real complex networks .",
    "as a validation case , we have here presented the results corresponding to functional networks of brain activity , as obtained through meg recordings of healthy people .",
    "the advantages of this method against other customary solutions , _",
    "e.g. _ the use of @xmath0-values obtained from kolmogorov - smirnoff tests , have been discussed .",
    "first , the lower computational cost , and especially its independence on the size of the parameters space and on the resolution of the analysis .",
    "this allows a better characterisation of such space , reducing the risk of missing relevant results when multiple local minima are present .",
    "second , the possibility of characterising the parameters space for single subjects , thus avoiding the need of having data for a full population .",
