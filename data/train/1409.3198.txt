    "core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) are recognized as the final stage of stars with initial mass @xmath58 m@xmath6 characterized by their great luminosities , comparable to the total luminosity of their host galaxies , and a sustained growth in size ( an envelope ejection ) due to the energy released by the gravitational collapse of the iron core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . among these sne , many show evidence for hydrogen ( h ) in their spectra , being historically classified as type ii @xcite . for this spectral type , @xcite proposed a subclassification based on the shape of the light curve during the photospheric phase , i.e. , the stage between maximum light and the transition to the radioactive tail : type ii `` plateau '' ( ii - p ) for those sne that display a nearly constant optical luminosity during @xmath7100 days , and type ii `` linear '' ( ii - l ) for those that show a linearly declining luminosity .",
    "two other subclasses have been introduced based on spectral characteristics : iin for sne that show narrow h emission lines @xcite , and iib for those that show h in early spectra that soon disappear @xcite .",
    "finally , few sne do not fit into the aforementioned subclasses , but show characteristics similar to sn 1987a ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recently , @xcite performed a photometric analysis of a sample of 116 sne ii .",
    "they did not find a clear separation between ii - p and ii - l subclasses , so they propose a continuous subclass , named simply `` ii '' , where each sn is characterized by the decline rate during the plateau phase .",
    "core - collapse sne are the most frequent of all sne ( 76% belonging to this class , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , being sne ii ( ii - p and ii - l ) the most frequent among core - collapse events ( @xmath755% , * ? ? ?",
    "the physics of radiative transfer during the photospheric phase of sne ii - p is the better understood and probably the easiest to model for sn theorists ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the above is further strengthened by the clear identification of red supergiants as progenitors of sne ii - p , fundamental to consolidate the hypothesis of a core - collapse process @xcite .",
    "all these characteristics ( i.e. , high luminosity , high relative frequency , and physical understanding of the phenomenon ) make sne ii - p well - suited for in - depth study , and interesting for distance measurement .    at present ,",
    "thermonuclear ( ia ) sne are the more mature astrophysical tool to measure distances : they are @xmath712 mag brighter than sne ii - p in the optical , and have been shown to display the highest degree of both photometric and spectroscopic homogeneity @xcite .",
    "type ia sne are not perfect standard candles , but empirical calibrations have allowed us to standardize their luminosities with a dispersion in absolute magnitude of @xmath70.150.22 mag and therefore determine distances to their host galaxies with an unprecedented precision of @xmath7710% @xcite .",
    "first attempts to measure distances to sne ii assume that these phenomena emit as blackbodies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the scattering - dominated atmospheres of sne ii are not well - suited for the simple blackbody approximation @xcite , and this becomes an important factor to consider in distance measurements .",
    "proposed solutions come from theoretical approaches to sn ii atmospheres by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , significant systematic discrepancies exist between these two sets of models , leading to @xmath750% differences in distances @xcite .    to get around this problem",

    "therefore , on the one hand we have theory - based methods with conflicting results , and , on the other , empirical methods that work well , but do not make full use of the possibilities of the underlying simple model .",
    "the goal of this research is to take advantage of the simplified physics of sne ii to find improved ways of estimating distances .",
    "we organize our work as follows : in  [ observational_material ] we describe the photometric and spectroscopic data . in  [ tools_to_measure_distances ] we develop the standard framework , and a standardization based on color is presented in  [ photospheric_magnitude ] . in  [ crucial_parameters ] we discuss some crucial parameters involved in our analysis , with emphasis in the development of a method to measure host galaxy extinction in  [ host_galaxy_extinction ] . in  [ analysis ]",
    "we show our results : extinction measurements , the color - based standardization , and an alternative standardization based on time since shock breakout . in  [ discussion ] we discuss some aspects of the classical surface brightness method , and the next refinement steps for the method proposed in this work .",
    "we present our conclusions in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we base our work in data obtained in the course of four different systematic sn follow - up programs : the cerro tololo sn program ( pis : phillips and suntzeff , 19862003 ) , the caln / tololo sn survey ( pi : hamuy , 19891993 ) , the supernova optical and infrared survey ( soirs ; pi : hamuy , 19992000 ) , and the carnegie type ii supernova survey ( cats ; pi : hamuy , 20022003 ) .",

    "_ sne ii have a similar spectral evolution during the photospheric phase_. this is partly supported by results of sn ii atmosphere models , which show that the emergent flux depends mainly on temperature @xcite . in that case , sne ii should have approximately the same intrinsic c3 with slope @xmath115 . as the c3 slope is not affected by reddening , the value of @xmath115 does not depend on dust extinction or dust properties ( i.e. , reddening law and @xmath98 ) .",
    "there could be , however , intrinsic differences due to the variations on the sn parameters , mainly those involved with the line profile formation ( e.g. , metallicity , density and expansion velocity profile ) .    \\2 .",
    "_ dust in sne ii sightlines is described by the same @xmath98_. sne ii tend to appear near regions , so the value of @xmath98 to use should be representative for these regions . in that case",
    ", the slope of reddening vectors will be the same for all sne .",
    "this allow us to identify the sn with the smallest reddening in a given sn set ( see figure [ 3 g ] ) : that with the lowest value of @xmath116 if the slope of the reddening vector is larger than @xmath115 , or that with the highest value of @xmath116 if the slope of the reddening vector is lower than @xmath115 .",
    "if the sn found with the smallest reddening by this method is consistent with small reddening found by other methods , then we can set its y - intercept as @xmath114 .",
    "the shock breakout epoch @xmath61 is one of the most important parameters in determining the actual stage of the expanding photosphere .",
    "this value is estimated as lying between the last nondetection @xmath117 and the first detection @xmath118 of the sn , where the first detection can be the discovery epoch @xmath119 or the time of a prediscovery detection if it is available . defining @xmath120 as the midpoint between @xmath117 and @xmath118 , and the uncertainty @xmath121 as half the time between @xmath117 and @xmath118 , i.e. , @xmath122@xmath123 ( where we choose to express time with respect to @xmath119 )",
    ", we can locate the shock breakout epoch in the range @xmath124 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we use @xmath125 instead of @xmath126 to emphasize that the uncertainty is not gaussian but uniform , with a probability distribution described by a top hat function .",
    "if a sn has a @xmath117 that yields a very high @xmath121 , or simply there is no nondetection report for the sn , then we use the shock breakout epoch obtained through the supernova identification code ( snid ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) given in @xcite .",
    "for some sne we compare their earliest spectra with a library of sn spectra using the gelato tool @xcite , then we constrain @xmath61 between the lowest and the highest value of @xmath61 estimated with the spectra comparison .",

    "table [ ladj ] lists the c3 slope values obtained for the sne in the @xmath106 ( column 2 ) and @xmath107 ( column 3 ) filter subsets .",
    "sn 2003gd and sn 2003ho do not describe clear straight lines in the color - color diagram because for these sne we have only late - time photometry .",
    "so we discard them for the c3 intrinsic slope determination .",
    "we also rule out sn 1991al and sn 2002ew due to the poor sampling in the @xmath12 and @xmath127 band respectively .",
    "we obtain mean slopes of @xmath128 and @xmath129 with standard deviations of 0.27 and 0.09 respectively . in each filter",
    "subset the measurement errors for the c3 slopes are lower than the standard deviation , so this value represents the intrinsic diversity in the c3 slope value",

    "this means that in the case of a c3@xmath134 the displacement produced by reddening is virtually along the same c3 , so the c3 method for the @xmath106 filter subset is not suitable to measure reddening . for the @xmath107 filter subset @xmath135 , so the c3 method for this filter subset ( hereafter c3(@xmath10 ) ) is very promising for measuring reddening .",

    "can also be due to the use of late - time spectra ( with flux correction in the case of sn 1992af and sn 2003fb ) , which are not the best for reddening determination with the spectroscopic analysis @xcite . discarding the outliers ,",
    "the dispersion is reduced to 0.21 mag , where the value of @xmath154 indicates that the dispersion is slightly lower than the combined uncertainties of both techniques .",

    "although negative reddening values have not physically meaningful , negative values in our sn set are statistically consistent with zero reddening , with the exception of sn 2008 in which differs by @xmath155 from zero reddening .",
    "a possible explanation for the negative value is the effect of a high metallicity , which reduces the flux in the @xmath12-band ( via line blanketing ) producing higher values of the @xmath0 color index .",
    "this effect moves the c3 upward , acting contrary to the reddening effect .",
    "based on the correlation between metallicity and the strength of the 5018   absorption line displayed by theoretical models , @xcite derive a metallicity for sn 2008 in of @xmath156 , which is the highest value in their sn set .",
    "so it is possible that sn 2008 in be a low or zero reddened sn , with @xmath157 due to a high metallicity .",
    "moreover , @xcite find sn 2003bn , one of our sne used to set the reddening zero point , among the sne with the lowest metallicities in their sn set .",
    "so sn 2003bn , which is consistent with zero reddening , also works as a zero point for the metallicity effect .",
    "as the @xmath141 value of sn 2003bn is virtually equal to @xmath152 , we will keep this value as the reddening zero point , but we will set @xmath158 mag for sn 2008 in .      since we are trying to understand the intrinsic dispersion of the color - based standardization , we do not want to introduce large dispersion from the distances in our trial sn sample .",

    "<S> we develop an empirical color - based standardization for type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) , equivalent to the classical surface brightness method given in @xcite . we calibrate it with sne ii with host galaxy distance measured with cepheids , and well - constrained shock breakout epoch and extinction due to the host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the reddening with an analysis of the @xmath0 versus @xmath1 color - color curves , similar to that of @xcite . with four sne ii meeting the above requirements </S>",
    "<S> , we build a photospheric magnitude versus color diagram ( similar to an hr diagram ) with a dispersion of 0.29 mag . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that when using time since shock breakout instead of color as independent variable , the same standardization gives a dispersion of 0.09 mag . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that the above time - based standardization corresponds to the generalization of the standardized candle method of @xcite for various epochs throughout the photospheric phase . to test the new tool </S>",
    "<S> , we construct hubble diagrams to different subsamples of 50 low - redshift ( @xmath2 km s@xmath3 ) sne ii . for 13 sne within the hubble flow ( @xmath4 km s@xmath3 ) and with well - constrained shock breakout epoch we obtain values of 6869 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 for the hubble constant , and an mean intrinsic scatter of 0.12 mag or 6% in relative distances . </S>"
