    "in the past decades , enormous effort has been dedicated to the study of two - dimensional area - preserving maps with the twist condition@xcite , but very few studies have been made of nontwist maps .",

    "the critical boundary has many sharp singular structures , and their locations seem to have a one - to - one correspondence with those of the reconnection thresholds .",
    "the relationship between the transition to global chaos and the reconnection processes was first pointed out by howard and hohs@xcite , but it has not yet been thoroughly investigated . + in order to investigate the detailed structure of the critical boundary , one needs accurate information regarding the reconnection processes . in this paper , we study the details of the reconnection processes in the quadratic twist map and propose a theoretical method to determine the reconnection thresholds .",
    "we show that the reversibility and symmetry of the mapping guarantee the existence of the `` indicator points '' in the phase space .",
    "these enable us to study the reconnection processes systematically . for twin - chains of period one and period two ,",
    "the reconnection thresholds have already been determined , either exactly or approximately@xcite .",

    "+ this paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we derive the location of the indicator points which play an important role in studying the reconnection processes in the qtm and give a review of the previous results on the transition to global chaos . in  3 ,",
    "the reconnection processes of even - periodic twin - chains are studied by using the indicator points .",
    "the reconnection thresholds are analytically derived , and a new type of reconnection process is analyzed . in  4 , we focus on the reconnection processes of odd - periodic twin - chains , and a new numerical method to determine the reconnection thresholds is proposed .",
    "section 5 contains a summary and discussion .",
    "by reversibility , the qtm can be rewritten as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are given by @xmath17 @xmath18 and they satisfy @xmath19 . moreover",
    ", the mapping @xmath20 commutes with the mapping @xmath21 ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) defined by @xmath23 previously@xcite , we showed that when there exists only one shearless curve in the phase space , it is an invariant set of both the mapping @xmath20 and the mapping @xmath21 .",
    "as shown in appendix a , the invariant sets are given by the following sets @xmath24  @xmath25 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the solutions of @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively . here",
    "@xmath31 represents an arbitrary integer , and @xmath32 represents the linear transformation defined by @xmath33 the solutions of eqs .",
    "( 2@xmath75 ) and ( 2@xmath76 ) are as follows : @xmath34 @xmath35 note that @xmath27 depends only on @xmath2 , while @xmath28 depends only on @xmath3 .",

    "( 2@xmath74 ) .",
    "we shall call these points , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , the `` indicator points '' in the present paper . as will be shown in what follows",
    ", we can detect the occurrence of the transition to global chaos and of the reconnection of twin - chains by investigating the iterates of the indicator points .",
    "+ when the iterates of the indicator points @xmath39 are confined in a bounded region , the following two cases are possible : i ) they are confined on a shearless curve  ( see fig .  1(a ) ) , or ii ) they are not confined on a certain kam curve , but several robust kam curves surrounding them prevent global chaotic motion  ( see fig .",
    "1(b ) ) . in either case",
    ", one can say that the bounded motion of the iterates of @xmath39 ensures the existence of kam curves . on the other hand , the unbounded motion of the iterates of @xmath39 guarantees the non - existence of kam curves .",
    "+ as reported in ref .",
    "6 ) , we have numerically determined whether the iterates of @xmath39 are bounded or not for each set of @xmath3 and @xmath2 . the phase diagram so obtained",
    "is shown in fig .  2 , where the iterates of @xmath39 are bounded in the gray region , but unbounded in the white region .",
    "thus , the boundary between the gray and the white regions displayed in fig .",
    "2 determines the critical boundary , where the transition to global chaos occurs . in numerical calculations ,",
    "we consider iterates to be bounded when the absolute values of their @xmath41 components do not exceed @xmath42 during @xmath43 steps of iteration  ( i.e. , @xmath44  for  @xmath45 ) . these conditions are sufficient to detect the bounded motion , because the robust kam curves are always localized around the indicator points @xmath39 , as shown in figs .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "in this section , we consider the case where either @xmath27 or @xmath28 is an even - periodic point with rotation number @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are relatively prime integers and let @xmath49 be even . by the symmetry of the mapping , eq .",

    "note that these relations do not depend on @xmath31 at all .",
    "the exact iterates of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are given for @xmath52 and @xmath53 in appendix c. the obtained @xmath3-@xmath2 relations are summarized in table i , where we put @xmath54 and @xmath55 let us denote the @xmath3-@xmath2 relations derived from eqs .  ( 3@xmath72 ) and ( 3@xmath73 ) by @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively ; i.e. , @xmath58 where @xmath31 is an arbitrary integer and @xmath59 in the @xmath3-@xmath2 parameter space , the two sets @xmath56 and @xmath57 are described by two different curves which pass through the trivial point @xmath60 .",
    "these curves are shown by solid lines in fig .  2 for several values of @xmath46  ( those for @xmath61 ) .",
    "there are two types of characteristic @xmath3-@xmath2 curves given for each value of @xmath46 .",
    "we shall call these curves the right @xmath62-curve or the left @xmath62-curve , depending on their relative positions , corresponding to the right - hand side or the left - hand side in fig .  2 .",
    "for @xmath62-curves that have a crossing point , we only apply the notion of right and left below the crossing point .",
    "some of the right and the left @xmath62-curves are summarized in table ii .",
    "+ note that the @xmath62-curves are quite similar to the @xmath62-bifurcation curve introduced by del - castillo - negrete et al.@xcite , where the @xmath62-bifurcation curve is defined as the @xmath3-@xmath2 locus which represents the creation / annihilation points of the twin - chains with rotation number @xmath46 .",
    "it will be shown later that either the right or the left @xmath62-curve which we have introduced here coincides well with the @xmath46-bifurcation curve .",
    "+ from numerical calculations , we can find the following general characteristics of the iterates of the indicator points @xmath39 and the characteristic @xmath63 curves defined by eq .",
    "( 3@xmath76 ) :    for the @xmath3-@xmath2 parameter values given by @xmath56(or @xmath57 ) , successive iterates of @xmath28(or @xmath27 ) converge to a periodic point with rotation number @xmath46 under the mapping @xmath64 .    for the @xmath3-@xmath2 parameter region between the right and the left @xmath62-curves , successive iterates of both @xmath27 and @xmath28 converge to an unstable periodic point with rotation number @xmath46 under the mapping @xmath64 .",
    "these properties are numerically illustrated in fig.3 for the case of @xmath65 .",
    "+ it is found in many cases that twin - chains with rotation number @xmath46 ( hereafter referred to as @xmath62-twin - chains ) are created or annihilated at parameter values on the left @xmath62-curve , and that the reconnection of the @xmath62-twin - chains takes place at parameter values on the right @xmath62-curve .",
    "thus , the left @xmath62-curve and the right @xmath62-curve correspond to the annihilation threshold and the reconnection threshold , respectively . in fig .  2",
    ", we can see nice agreement of the critical boundary and the right @xmath62-curves for many @xmath46 .",
    "this is more clearly shown in fig .  4 for the case of @xmath66 .",
    "however , this correspondence does not always hold for all @xmath46 .",
    "for instance , in the cases of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , it is the left @xmath62-curve that coincides with the critical boundary .",
    "this is more clearly shown in fig .  5 for the case of @xmath68 .",
    "this exceptional correspondence occurs when the left @xmath62-curve changes to correspond to the reconnection threshold at a certain point on the curve .",
    "+ let us illustrate this for the left @xmath69-curve .",
    "figures 6(a)@xmath70(e ) display phase space portraits for various values of @xmath2 , where @xmath2 increases along the left @xmath69-curve . at @xmath71 ,",
    "marginally stable periodic points with rotation number @xmath72 exist in the phase space , as shown in fig.6(a ) . at @xmath73 ,",
    "the periodic point becomes unstable and gives birth to two elliptic points , as shown in fig .",
    "we refer to the chain of these periodic points as the primary chain . at @xmath74 ,",
    "another pair of periodic points with rotation number @xmath72 is created on both sides of the primary chain via a saddle - node(sn ) bifurcation .",
    "figure 6(c ) exhibits the phase space portrait at @xmath75 , where two chains of sn pairs appear , in addition to the primary chain mentioned above .",
    "we refer to these chains of sn pairs as the secondary chains .",
    "moreover , at @xmath76 , the two separatrices of the primary chain and those of the secondary chains merge , as shown in fig .",
    "6(d ) . as a result of the reconnection process induced by the merging of the primary and secondary chains , vortex pairs and two poincar - birkhoff chains come to appear , as shown in fig .",
    "+ to summarize , the left @xmath69-curve corresponds to the annihilation threshold of the primary chain for @xmath77 . while , for @xmath78 , it corresponds to the reconnection threshold of the vortex pairs that are formed via the reconnection process of the primary and secondary chains . +",
    "in this section we characterize the reconnection of odd - periodic twin - chains by using the indicator points . at a reconnection threshold of the @xmath62-twin - chains , successive iterates of both @xmath79 and @xmath80",
    "approach the same hyperbolic periodic point of the reconnecting twin - chains under the mapping @xmath81 .",
    "figure 7(a ) corresponds to the case of the @xmath82-twin - chains at the reconnection threshold .",
    "figure 7(b ) is the magnification of the phase space near the lower hyperbolic periodic point of the @xmath82-twin - chains , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 approach the same hyperbolic periodic point as @xmath85 increases .",
    "we have numerically confirmed this property for all odd - periodic twin - chains with period @xmath86 .",
    "this property seems to hold even at a large @xmath2-value , as shown in fig .  8 , where we can still observe monotonic convergence in spite of strong chaos around a hyperbolic periodic point .",
    "+ consider the quantity @xmath87 given by @xmath88 where @xmath31 is an arbitrary integer and @xmath89 represents the euclidian norm . at the reconnection threshold , @xmath87 is expected to decrease exponentially as @xmath90 where @xmath91 represents the smaller  ( stable ) eigenvalue of the tangent map of the mapping @xmath92 evaluated at the hyperbolic periodic point of the @xmath62-twin - chains .",
    "numerical evidence for the exponential scaling regime of eq .",
    "( 4@xmath72 ) at the reconnection threshold of the @xmath82-twin - chains is shown in fig .  9 for various @xmath2-values .",
    "there appear large deviations from the scaling regime when the number of iterations @xmath85 becomes extremely large , because the monotonic convergence of @xmath87 is violated by heteroclinic chaos near the hyperbolic periodic point .",
    "however , as shown in table iii , the decay rates in the scaling regime are in good agreement with the theoretically estimated values of @xmath93 .",
    "+ on the basis of the remarkable convergent property mentioned above , the determination of the reconnection threshold is reduced to the problem of finding the parameter values where @xmath94 holds for a given small value @xmath95 with a certain large @xmath96 .",
    "the merit of this computational criterion is that it does not require any additional knowledge about the detailed structure of twin - chains , such as the location of the periodic point and its stability . applying this criterion",
    ", we numerically determined the reconnection thresholds for odd - periodic twin - chains with the period @xmath86 , which are indicated by solid lines for @xmath49=odd in fig .  2 .",
    "the results based on the above technique seem to reproduce the reconnection thresholds .",
    "this is illustrated more clearly in fig .",
    "10 for the case of the @xmath82-twin - chains .",
    "we have studied in detail the reconnection processes of twin - chains in the qtm by investigating the iterates of the indicator points @xmath39 which belong to the invariant sets of both the mapping @xmath20 and the mapping @xmath21 . for the case of even - periodic twin - chains",
    ", we introduced @xmath62-curves in the parameter space , on which either the annihilation or the reconnection of the @xmath62-twin - chains occurs . we succeeded in deriving the @xmath62-curves analytically for @xmath97 .",
    "one can also derive @xmath62-curves with larger value of @xmath49 by solving eqs .",
    "( 3@xmath72 ) and ( 3.3 ) .",
    "on the other hand , for the case of odd - periodic twin - chains , we propose a numerical method to determine the reconnection threshold .",
    "the method is based on the observation that the successive iterates of the indicator points converge to the same hyperbolic periodic point at the reconnection threshold .",
    "numerical results clearly show that the critical boundary is described well by the reconnection thresholds of twin - chains .",
    "+ finally , we briefly discuss the reconnection process between the primary and the secondary twin - chains which was found for the @xmath69-twin - chains .",
    "the variety of reconnecting twin - chains has been studied in cubic and quartic twist maps@xcite .",
    "for example , cubic twist maps exhibit the reconnection of three island chains with the same rotation number .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the fact that the cubic twist function generically has two extrema and that each extremum generates an inherent reconnection process .",
    "however , it is surprising that multiple reconnection processes occur simultaneously even in the qtm whose twist function has only one extremum .",
    "the occurrence of the secondary twin - chains inevitably ensures the existence of multiple shearless curves in the phase space , neither of which passes through the indicator points @xmath39(see figs .",
    "6(c ) and ( e ) ) .",
    "our result suggests that shearless curves can be created by nonintegrable nonlinear perturbations .",
    "this problem will be discussed elsewhere .",
