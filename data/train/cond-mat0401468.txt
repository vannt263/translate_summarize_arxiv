    "low temperature oscillations of diverse electromagnetic and thermal characteristics ( resistivity , magnetization , susceptibility , thermal conduction , heat capacity etc . ) of macroscopic and mesoscopic bodies in an increasing uniform magnetic field are apparently a general property of systems formed by charged particles .",
    "these oscillations have been last years studied experimentally and theoretically in mesoscopic systems of different geometry and microscopical structure : in mesoscopic rings  @xcite , in a thin spherical layer  @xcite , in superconducting discs  @xcite , in micron - size heterostrucures  @xcite .",
    "observing such variety of properties and objects one is forced to arrive at a conclusion that there must be a common reason for arising this phenomenon . in this letter as a source of such oscillations we regard crossings of the quantum levels of a mesoscopic system abstracting from the physical nature of the levels and system itself .",
    "we concentrate here on static properties ( the magnetic susceptibility @xmath0 and heat capacity @xmath1 ) in the regime of the thermodynamical equilibrium of the canonical ensemble at low temperatures .",
    "we assume that a system exposed to a uniform magnetic field  ( @xmath2 ) possesses a number of discrete quantum states altering their mutual energy disposition depending on @xmath2 .",
    "thereby for each value of @xmath2 there exist a lowest state , the ground state for a given @xmath2 , and the nearest to it first excited state with energies @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "each of these energies is a smooth function of @xmath2 , however @xmath3 and @xmath4 can locally have opposite slopes with @xmath2 . therefore the difference @xmath5 @xmath6 can become equal to zero for a value of @xmath7 .    in sec.2 we show that this point of the level crossing is a peculiar point where at very small temperatures both @xmath0 and @xmath1 reach local extrema : a _ maximum _ for @xmath0 and a _ minimum _ for @xmath1 .",
    "in the low temperature limit only two first terms practically exhaust the canonical partition function @xmath8 the rest , @xmath9 , gives a weak background for @xmath0 and @xmath1 near the point @xmath10 in the vicinity of which the partition function can be expressed via a small parameter @xmath11 : @xmath12 the magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity are naturally divided near @xmath10 into smoothly varying parts @xmath13 , @xmath14 and the rapidly varying functions @xmath15 , @xmath16 with extrema in @xmath10 : @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 is the volume of the system .",
    "the derivative @xmath20 implies hereafter the derivative with respect to @xmath2 in the point of @xmath7 .    at low temperatures ( @xmath21",
    ", @xmath22 is the mean level spacing at @xmath23 ) we take into account only those terms in eqs.(5 ) and ( 7 ) which are proportional to the maximum power of @xmath24 at @xmath7 , @xmath25 , that gives @xmath26 @xmath15 is paramagnetic ( @xmath13 determines the diamagnetic component of @xmath0 ) and proportional to the squared difference of the magnetic moments of the crossing states .",
    "thus , eqs.(8 )  -(11 ) confirm the existence of a local maximum in @xmath0 and a minimum in @xmath1 at the level crossing point @xmath10 . increasing the field",
    "can generate appearance of new level crossing points that will give @xmath0 and @xmath1 an oscillating functions of @xmath2 .",
    "intervals between peaks and their amplitudes depends on the physical nature of the system and its shape .",
    "here we limit ourselves by considering weak fields ( the cyclotron radius is much larger than the size of the system ) .",
    "the alterations of quantum levels v.s .",
    "@xmath2 are caused by removing the spin and rotational degeneracy , the latter occurs when a system has rotational symmetry . to investigate oscillating behavior of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in sec.3",
    "we apply the independent electron model to normal mesoscopic systems and in sec.4 superconducting clusters of the perfect spherical shape are described by using the exact solution of the conventional superconducting hamiltonian .",
    "the character of oscillations in electron @xmath0 and @xmath1 of a mesoscopic system is dependent on the its shape . in spherical clusters at @xmath23",
    "each many  fold degenerate level ( the spin - orbital interaction is omitted here ) displays a sheaf - wise splitting .",
    "hence magnetic sublevels originated from one spherical @xmath27-shell ( @xmath27 is an orbital momentum ) can not cross each other with the growth of @xmath2 .",
    "thus the minimum strength of a magnetic field , @xmath28 , ( here we consider the case of the closed fermi ",
    "shell at @xmath23 ) required to arouse the first crossing and the first extremum is determined by @xmath29 , the distance between the fermi ",
    "shell , @xmath30shell , and the unoccupied @xmath31shell at @xmath23 : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the effective electron mass .",
    "we assume that orbital and spin projections are aligned at the first crossing .",
    "nevertheless the absolute value of @xmath28 is practically independent of @xmath27 , since the level splitting near @xmath35 at @xmath23 is proportional to @xmath27 : @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the mean level spacing of the fermi gas near the fermi energy ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath39 and for nanometer normal metallic clusters ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) @xmath28 is of the order of @xmath44 . the evolution of some single  electron levels in a spherical cavity and corresponding extrema in @xmath0 and @xmath1 are shown in fig.1 .",
    "properties of quantum dots are frequently interpreted in the two - dimensional cylindrically symmetric oscillator model  @xcite .",
    "this symmetry also gives a rather high degeneracy of electron levels near the fermi level , which is removed in the same manner as in the previous spherical case .",
    "@xmath28 of the first level crossing is assessed analogously : @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the free electron number in the quantum dot . as @xmath38 and @xmath47 for such systems can be small ( e.g. for gaas @xmath48 , @xmath41 @xmath49  @xcite ) oscillations of @xmath0 could be observable in relatively weak fields for a wide range of @xmath46 . @xmath0 and @xmath1 v.s",
    "the cyclotron frequency are shown in fig.2,3 for @xmath50 ( we consider the case of the closed cylindrical fermi  shell at @xmath51 ) .",
    "the feature of @xmath0 and @xmath1 oscillations in systems with cylindrical or spherical symmetry is the presence of several groups of peaks corresponding firstly crossings of levels from two nearest cylindrical or spherical shells separated at @xmath23 by one shell gap , then cross levels separated at @xmath23 by two shell gaps and so on .",
    "increasing temperature ( fig.3 ) leads to confluence of separate peaks so that curves for @xmath0 and @xmath1 become similar and their gross structure is caused by the shell structure of the single  particle energy spectrum .",
    "much simpler behavior of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as function of @xmath2 is observed in clusters having no rotation symmetry axis . in this case level crossings",
    "are caused by the zeeman splitting and perturbation of orbital motion by weak fields proves to be insignificant , because orbital energy shifts for such systems are quadratic in @xmath2 .",
    "then signs of energy denominators appearing in perturbative calculations are opposite for levels near the fermi ",
    "level that reduces second order terms .",
    "the example of such `` spin '' oscillations of @xmath0 is concerned with electron system in the oscillator well with oscillator frequencies @xmath52 that corresponds to an ellipsoid with semiaxes @xmath53 ( we adopt the relation between semiaxes and oscillator frequencies from ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath54 ) .",
    "such system has no rotation axis and a magnetic field directed along @xmath55axis generates `` spin '' oscillations ( fig.4 ) .",
    "these oscillations of @xmath0 in the anysotropic oscillator are much like oscillations in the equal level spacing model @xcite .",
    "another example of magnetic oscillations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is given by the single - shell model ( ssm ) of superconductivity .",
    "such model can be a reasonable approach to a description of spherical superconducting clusters with numbers of conduction electrons @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "there is a wide range of orbital momentum @xmath30 for states successively becoming the fermi level with growth of @xmath46 .",
    "averaging through @xmath46 gives @xmath57 @xcite . at @xmath23 the level spacing between degenerate shells",
    "@xmath58 is much more than the bcs superconducting gap at @xmath59 , @xmath60 , e.g. @xmath61  @xmath49 and @xmath62  @xmath49 for @xmath63-clusters with @xmath46 under consideration .",
    "therefore the superconducting pair correlations can arise between electrons ( their number is @xmath64 ) occupying only one shell with a large @xmath27 .",
    "the hamiltonian of ssm consists of the pairing interaction with the strength @xmath65 and the interaction with a field @xmath2 .",
    "the exact spectrum of such hamiltonian is well known  @xcite and at @xmath23 is determined by the seniority @xmath66 ( unpaired electron number ) @xmath67 for each @xmath66 there is a multiplet of states ( degenerate at @xmath23 ) with different orbital and spin projections which are splitted by a field .",
    "the energy of the lowest state for each @xmath66 is @xmath68 + 4(1-\\delta_{\\nu.0 } ) \\},\\ ] ] thus with growth of @xmath2 ( in this section @xmath69 ) the role of the ground state is successively played by states with @xmath70 for even @xmath71 or @xmath72 for odd @xmath64 , i.e. increasing @xmath2 leads to a sequence of crossings of the @xmath66-level with @xmath73-level , resulting in a step  wise decrease of the pairing gap ( the region of the gapless superconductivity ) .    to take into account the temperature dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 quantities we have analytically summed up those components of the canonical partition function @xmath74 which involve states inside the considered @xmath27shell @xmath75,\\\\ \\phi_{\\nu}=\\sum_{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{min}}}^{\\nu",

    "the latter is measured in @xmath76 , the critical temperature of the conventional bcs theory for half  filled shell .",
    "oscillations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 created by level crossings in ssm spread on a range of rather small fields @xmath77 @xcite ( @xmath78 @xmath79 for @xmath63-clusters with @xmath80 and @xmath43 ) . in nonspherical superconducting clusters where a weak magnetic field does not influence orbital motion , the level crossings are determined only by alignment of spins",
    ". therefore greater values of @xmath28 are expected to induce the first extrema in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in conclusion we have shown that an increasing uniform magnetic field applied to a mesoscopic system transforms the structure of the ground state in a such a way that in level crossing points synchronously appear local extrema in magnetic susceptibility ( _ maxima _ ) and heat capacity ( _ minima _ ) .",
    "thereby these thermodynamic quantities oscillate with growth field .",
    "periodicity and amplitudes of the low temperature oscillations carry information concerning properties of the quantum states of investigated normal and superconducting systems .",
