    "the lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) interactions , non - zero electric dipole moments ( edm ) and the anomalous magnetic moments ( amm ) of leptons are among the most promising candidates to search for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the amm of the muon have been studied in the literature extensively @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the experimental result of the muon amm by the g-2 collaboration @xcite has been obtained as @xmath0 and recently , at bnl @xcite , a new experimental world average has been announced @xmath1 which has about half of the uncertainty of previous measurements .",
    "this result has opened a new window for testing the sm and the new physics effects beyond .",
    "the sm prediction for @xmath2 is written in terms of different contributions @xcite ; @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the hadronic contributions are under theoretical investigation . with the new data from novosibirsk @xcite , the calculation of the first order hadronic vacuum polarization to @xmath6",
    "is obtained as @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) using the @xmath9 @xmath10 based result .",
    "the addition of the higher order contributions , @xmath11 and light by light scattering @xmath12 , result in @xmath13 ( @xmath14 based on @xmath15 @xmath10 data .",
    "therefore , there is a @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) standard deviation from the experimental result and this could possibly be due to the effects of new physics , at present .",
    "various scenarios have been proposed to explain the nonvanishing value of the deviation @xmath18 @xcite - @xcite , previously .",
    "the supersymmetry ( susy ) contribution to @xmath2 has been investigated in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the new physics effect on @xmath2 has been explained by introducing a new light gauge boson .",
    "the prediction of the muon amm has been estimated in the framework of leptoquark models in @xcite , the technicolor model with scalars and top color assisted technicolor model in @xcite , in the framework of the general two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) in @xcite and also in @xcite .",
    "the work @xcite was devoted to the higgs mediated lepton flavor violating interactions which contributed to @xmath2 .",
    "in this study , only the scalar higgs exchange was taken into account by assuming that the pseudoscalar higgs particle was sufficiently heavier than the scalar one . finally , in @xcite , scalar scenarios contributing to @xmath2 with enhanced yukawa coupling were proposed .    in @xcite , the upper bound on leptonic flavor changing",
    "coupling , related with the transition @xmath19 , has been obtained in the 2hdm as @xmath20 , using the amm of the muon by considering that the dominant contribution comes from the lighter scalar boson . in this case the uncertainty between the sm prediction and the experimentalone was taken as @xmath21 and it was emphasized that this bound would decrease to the values of @xmath22 with the reduction of the uncertainty up to a factor @xmath23 .    in our work , we study the new physics effects on the amm of the muon using the model iii version of the 2hdm of reference @xcite , including both scalar and pseudoscalar higgs boson effects , based on the assumption that the numerical value should not exceed the present experimental uncertainty , @xmath24 . the new contribution to @xmath2 exists at one - loop level with internal mediating neutral particles @xmath25 and @xmath26 in our case , since we do not include charged fc interaction in the leptonic sector due to the small couplings for @xmath27 interactions . in the calculations ,",
    "we take into account the internal @xmath28 and @xmath29 leptons and neglect the contribution coming from the internal @xmath30-lepton since the corresponding yukawa coupling is expected to be smaller compared to the others .",
    "furthermore , we also neglect the internal @xmath29-lepton contribution by observing the weak dependence of @xmath18 on the @xmath29-@xmath29 coupling .",
    "we predict a stringent upper bound for the @xmath29-@xmath28 coupling and compare with the one , which is obtained by using the restriction coming from the edm of @xmath29 lepton ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the new physics effects on the amm of the muon in the framework of the general 2hdm . section 3 is devoted to discussion and our conclusions .",
    "in the type iii 2hdm , there exist flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) , mediated by the new higgs bosons , at tree level .",
    "the most general higgs - fermion interaction for the leptonic sector in this model reads as @xmath31 where @xmath32 are family indices of leptons , @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote chiral projections @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are lepton doublets and singlets respectively , @xmath38 for @xmath39 , are the two scalar doublets @xmath40\\ , ;   \\phi_{2}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\begin{array}{c c }   \\sqrt{2 } h^{+}\\\\ h_1+i h_2 \\end{array}\\right ) \\,\\ , , \\label{choice}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the vacuum expectation values @xmath41 with the help of this parametrization and considering the gauge and @xmath42 invariant higgs potential which spontaneously breaks @xmath43 down to @xmath44 as : @xmath45 ^ 2 + c_4 [ ( \\phi_1^+ \\phi_1 ) ( \\phi_2^+ \\phi_2)-(\\phi_1^+ \\phi_2)(\\phi_2^+ \\phi_1 ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + &   c_5 [ re(\\phi_1^+ \\phi_2)]^2 + c_{6 } [ im(\\phi_1^+ \\phi_2)]^2   + c_{7}\\,\\ , , \\label{potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the sm particles and new particles beyond can be collected in the first and second doublets respectively . here @xmath46 is the sm higgs boson and @xmath47 are the new neutral higgs particles .",
    "since there is no mixing of neutral higgs bosons at tree level for this choice of higgs doublets , @xmath47 is the usual scalar ( pseudoscalar ) @xmath48 .    in the yukawa interaction eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) , the part which is responsible for the fcnc at tree level reads as @xmath49 notice that , in the following we will replace @xmath50 by @xmath51 to emphasize that the couplings are related to the neutral interactions .",
    "the yukawa matrices @xmath51 have in general complex entries and they are free parameters which should be fixed by using the various experimental results .    the effective interaction for the anomalous magnetic moment of the lepton is defined as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the electromagnetic field tensor and `` @xmath54 '' is the amm of the lepton `` @xmath55 '' , @xmath56 .",
    "this interaction can be induced by the neutral higgs bosons @xmath25 and @xmath26 at loop level in the model iii , beyond the sm .",
    "as mentioned we do not take charged fc interaction in the leptonic sector due to the small couplings for @xmath27 interactions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we present the 1-loop diagrams due to neutral higgs particles . since , the self energy @xmath57 ( diagrams @xmath58 , @xmath59 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) vanishes when the @xmath55-lepton is on - shell , in the on - shell renormalization scheme , only the vertex diagram @xmath60 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] contributes to the calculation of the amm of the lepton @xmath55 .",
    "the most general lorentz - invariant form of the coupling of a charged lepton to a photon of four - momentum @xmath61 can be written as @xmath62 where @xmath61 is the photon 4-vector and the @xmath63 dependent form factors @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are proportional to the charge , amm and edm of the @xmath55-lepton respectively . using the definition of amm of the lepton @xmath55 ( eq . ( [ amm1 ] ) ) ,",
    "@xmath67 is extracted as @xmath68 where @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) is the contribution coming from the internal @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) lepton .",
    "the functions @xmath69 and @xmath71 are given by @xmath72 and @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are @xmath76 here @xmath77 and @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the charges of @xmath28 and @xmath29 leptons respectively .",
    "( [ tauanom1 ] ) and ( [ tauanom2 ] ) @xmath81 is defined as @xmath82 . in eq .",
    "( [ tauanom ] ) we take into account internal @xmath28 and @xmath29-lepton contributions since , the yukawa couplings @xmath83 @xmath84 ( or @xmath85)@xmath86 are negligible ( see discussion part ) .",
    "notice that we make our calculations for arbitrary @xmath63 and take @xmath87 at the end .",
    "in our analysis we take the couplings @xmath88 and @xmath89 complex in general and use the parametrization @xmath90 the yukawa factors in eqs .",
    "( [ tauanom1 ] ) and ( [ tauanom2 ] ) can be written as @xmath91 where @xmath92 . here",
    "@xmath93 are cp violating parameters which lead to the existence of the lepton electric dipole moment .",
    "the new physics contribution to the amm of the lepton is controlled by the yukawa couplings @xmath94 in the model iii .",
    "these couplings can be complex in general and they are free parameters of the model under consideration .",
    "the relevant interaction ( see eq . ( [ amm1 ] ) ) can be created by the mediation of the neutral higgs bosons @xmath25 and @xmath26 beyond the sm , with internal leptons @xmath95 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "however , in our predictions , we assume that the yukawa couplings @xmath96 and @xmath89 are small compared to @xmath88 since their strength is proportional to the masses of the leptons denoted by their indices , similar to the cheng - sher scenerio @xcite .",
    "notice that , we also assume @xmath81 as symmetric with respect to the indices @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , the number of free yukawa couplings is reduced by two and one more coupling , namely @xmath88 still exists as a free parameter .",
    "this parameter can be restricted by using the experimental result of the @xmath29 edm @xcite @xmath97 at @xmath98 cl limit and the corresponding theoretical result for the edm of the muon in the model iii ( see @xcite for details ) . since",
    "a non - zero edm can be obtained in the case of complex couplings , there exist a cp violating parameter @xmath99 coming from the parametrization eq .",
    "( [ xi ] ) . using the experimental restriction in eq.([muedmex ] ) , the upper limit of the coupling @xmath88 is predicted at the order of the magnitude of @xmath100 .    the other possibility to get",
    "a constraint for the upper limit of @xmath88 is to use the experimental result of the muon amm . in this work",
    ", we study the new physics effects on the muon amm and predict a more stringent bound for the coupling @xmath88 , with the assumption that the new physics effects are of the order of the experimental uncertainty of the muon amm measurement .",
    "we also check the effect of the coupling @xmath89 on amm of the muon and observe that amm has a weak sensitivity on this coupling .",
    "this insensitivity is due to the suppression coming from the factors @xmath101 and @xmath102 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ tauanom2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can take @xmath88 as the only free parameter .    fig .",
    "[ anommagtauksi ] shows the @xmath103 dependence of @xmath67 for @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 . here , @xmath67 is of the order of magnitude @xmath107 , increases with increasing value of the coupling @xmath103 and exceeds the experimental uncertainty , namely @xmath107",
    "this forces us to restrict the coupling @xmath103 as @xmath108 for intermediate values of @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "this is a much better upper limit compared to the one obtained using the experimental result of the @xmath29 edm .    in fig .",
    "[ anomagtausin ] , we show the @xmath109 dependence of @xmath67 for @xmath111 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "increasing values of @xmath109 cause @xmath67 to decrease and to lie within the experimental uncertainty .    in fig .",

    "we choose the type iii 2hdm of @xcite for the physics beyond the sm and assume that only fcnc interactions exist at tree level , with complex yukawa couplings .",
    "we predict an upper limit for the coupling @xmath103 for the intermediate values of the imaginary part , by assuming that the new physics effects are of the order of the experimental uncertainty of muon amm , namely @xmath107 , and see that this leads to a much better upper limit , @xmath116 , compared to the one obtained by using the experimental result of the @xmath29 edm , @xmath117 . in the calculations , we studied the internal @xmath29 lepton contributions as well .",
    "however , we observe that they give a negligible contribution to the amm of muon . furthermore",
    ", we neglect the @xmath30 lepton contribution . with more accurate future measurements of the amm , it should be possible to constrain the parameters of the two higgs doublet model more stringently .",
