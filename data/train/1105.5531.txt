    "silicon carbide ( sic ) crystallizes in either a cubic or a hexagonal form , and exbihits interesting polytypism  @xcite .",
    "the polytypes are made of identical hexagonal layers with different stacking sequences .",
    "these polytypes are semiconductors with a range of band gaps , from 2.39 ev in the zincblende polytype ( 3c ) to 3.33 ev in the wurtzite polytype ( 2h )  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , 3c and 6h sic are used for high temperature , high - power and high - frequency devices  @xcite due to their unique properties  @xcite , while 6h sic with a band gap of 2.86 ev is a useful material for blue light - emitting diode applications  @xcite .",
    "recently , sic nanotubes ( nts ) were synthesized by reaction of carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) with sio at various temperatures  @xcite . like other tubular materials such as c  @xcite ,",
    "bn  @xcite , aln  @xcite , and gan  @xcite nanotubes that have been synthesized previously , sic - nts display very interesting properties distinctly different from their bulks . therefore , the successful synthesis of the sic - nts has stimulated a number of theoretical and experimental investigations on tubular form of sic ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , based on density - functional calculations , miyamoto and yu  @xcite predicted that the strain energies of sic - nts are lower than that of cnts , and that the band gaps of sic - nts can be direct or indirect , depending on the chirality . using both tight - binding molecular dynamics and @xmath1 methods , menon and coworkers",
    "@xcite showed that single - walled sic - nts are very stable with a large band gap . unlike cnts ,",
    "sic - nts are polar materials and therefore , may exhibit unusual physical properties that cnts may not have .",
    "for example , like bn - nts ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , zigzag sic - nts may become piezoelectric , and also show second - order non - linear optical response .",
    "a knowledge of the optical properties of sic - nts is important for their optical and electro - optical applications .",
    "therefore , wu and guo have recently carried out a series of _ ab initio _ calculations within the density functional theory ( dft ) with the local density approximation ( lda ) in order to analyze the linear optical features and underlying band structure as well as the second - harmonic generation and linear electro - optical coefficients of all three types of the sic - nts.@xcite in particular , wu and guo found that all the sic nanotubes are semiconductors with exceptions of the ultrasmall ( 3,0 ) and ( 4,0 ) zigzag tubes which may be regarded as the thinnest conducting sic nanowires.@xcite interestingly , the band gap of the zigzag sic - nts may be reduced from the energy gap of the sic sheet all the way down to zero by reducing the diameter , though the band gap for all the sic nanotubes with a diameter larger than @xmath220 @xmath3 approaches that of the sic sheet .",
    "furthermore , dft indicates that all the semiconducting _ zigzag _ sic - nts have a direct band gap .",
    "all these suggest that they may have interesting applications in optical and optoelectronic devices .",
    "nonetheless , both the armchair and chiral sic - nts have an indirect band gap at the dft level .",
    "these previous theoretical studies of the electronic and optical properties of sic - nts were based on the independent - particle approximation within the dft framework@xcite or on semi - empirical calculations@xcite . however , many - body interactions are known to play an important role in low - dimensional systems such as nanotubes@xcite , due to reduced charge screening and enhanced electron - electron correlation .",
    "therefore , motivated by the prospects of optoelectronic device applications of sic - nts and also this theoretical issue , we have performed _ ab initio _ calculations to study the many - body effects on the quasiparticle band gaps and optical spectra of sic - nts .",
    "indeed , we find pronounced gw quasiparticle corrections of more than 1.0 ev to the lda band gaps in the sic - nts .",
    "further , the calculated optical absorption spectra from the sic - nts are dominated by the discrete exciton peaks due to strongly bound excitons with a large binding energy of up to 2.0 ev .    sic - nts can be considered as an atomic layer of sic sheet rolled up into a cylinder , and similar to the cnts the structure of a sic - nt is specified by the chiral vector which is given in term of a pair of integers ( @xmath4).@xcite understanding the optical properties of an isolated sic sheet would help understand the many - body effects on the optical responses of sic - nts . therefore , the single atomic layer hexagonal sic sheet is first considered here .",
    "furthermore , the optical properties of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) single sic sheet are interesting on their own account , and , in particular , a single sic sheet bears many similarities to graphene which exhibits many fascinating properties.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the theoretical methods and computational details , including the ground - state , quasiparticle and electron - hole interaction calculations , are described . in sec .",
    "iii , the calculated quasipartice band structure and optical absorption spectrum of the isolated sic sheet are presented . in sec .",
    "iv , the calculated quasiparticle band structures of the sic - nts are reported and the effects of curvature and chirality on the band gaps are analyzed . in sec .",
    "v , the calculated optical absorption spectra of the sic - nts are presented , and the excitonic effects are discussed . finally , the conclusions drawn from this work are given in sec .",
    "in the present paper , we adopt the approach of rohlfing and louie@xcite and hence calculate the quasiparticle energies , electron - hole excitations and optical spectra from first - principles in three steps .",
    "first , we calculate the electronic ground state with dft in the lda.@xcite second , we obtain the quasiparticle energies ( @xmath5 ) within the gw approximation for the electron self energy @xmath6.@xcite finally , we evaluate the coupled electron - hole excitation energies and optical spectra by solving the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) of the two - particle green s function.@xcite details of our computations are described below .      an appropriate mean - field description of the ground - state properties of solids is essential to perform quasiparticle calculations within many - body perturbation theory .",
    "for the conventional covalent and ionic bonded materials , it is shown @xcite that eigen wavefunctions and eigen energies of the kohn - sham equation@xcitein the lda provide a good starting point for the many - body perturbation calculations such as within the gw approximations .",
    "therefore , in this paper , the ground - state electronic structure of the single sic sheet and sic - nts are first calculated by means of _ ab initio _ plane - wave pseudopotential method@xcite .",
    "the electronic configurations of si(@xmath7 ) and c(@xmath8 ) are treated as active valence states when generating pseudopotentials in the kleinman - bylander form@xcite for all the calculations .",
    "the cutoff energy of 40 ry for the plane wave basis set is used . also to ensure the convergency , the brillouin zone ( bz ) integrals for the calculations of the sic sheet and sic - nts",
    "are carried out using the 10@xmath910@xmath91 and 1@xmath91@xmath932 monkhorst - pack @xmath10-grid sampling@xcite , respectively .",
    "the supercell approach is used here such that an isolated sic sheet ( nanotube ) is approximated by a single sic layer ( nanotube ) surrounded by vacuum in a supercell .",
    "sufficient intersheet and intertube separations ( more than 10 @xmath11 ) are used to prevent intersheet and intertube interactions .",
    "the underlying atomic positions and lattice constants are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite where the theoretical structures were obtained by the conjugate gradient method with the atomic forces and the stress calculated from first - principles .      based on the ground - state kohn - sham wavefunctions and corresponding eigenvalues ( @xmath12 ) calculated above",
    ", the many - body effects on the quasiparticle band structure characterized by the self energy ( @xmath6 ) can be evaluated by solving the dyson equation @xcite",
    "@xmath13|n{\\bf k}>=e_{n\\bf{k}}^{qp}|n{\\bf k}>\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the hamiltonian in the hatree approximation , and @xmath15 represents the quasiparticle wavefunction of energy @xmath16 within one - partcile green s function method . in the @xmath17 approximation ,",
    "the vertex correction is approximated by a delta function and the irreducible polarizibility @xmath18 is a convolution of the mean field green s function @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "this gives rise to a dynamical dielectric matrix within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) scheme and a generalized plasmon - pole ( gpp ) model@xcite .",
    "also , the screened coulomb potential @xmath21 can be obtained from the bare coulomb interaction @xmath22 through the equation @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "finally , the quasiparticle self - energy operator is given by @xmath24 .",
    "although alternatives have been proposed recently to calculate the self energy going beyond this approximation , the @xmath17 approach is still the most efficient scheme for providing a successful description of the electronic excitation and even transport properties in various semiconductors , metals , surfaces , and novel nanomaterials@xcite .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we adopt the @xmath17 approach to calculate the quasiparticle properties of the single sic sheet and sic - nts . here a rather dense @xmath10-point sampling for the sic sheet ( 18@xmath918@xmath91 ) and also for the sic - nts ( 1@xmath91@xmath932 ) is used to ensure the calculated quasiparticle energies converged to within @xmath25 ev .     the calculated quasiparticle band gap of a sic sheet ( open symbols ) as a function of the inverse of intersheet separation ( @xmath26 ) . the converged band gap indicated as the solid line is derived by employing the coulomb truncation scheme .",
    "the dashed line linking the open circles is a guide to the eye only . ]",
    ".the band gap ( @xmath27 ) and quasiparticle energy differences between the conduction band minimum ( @xmath28 ) and valence band maximum ( @xmath22 ) at some high symmetry @xmath10-points of the sic sheet from the lda and gw [ without / with the coulomb truncation ( no trunc.)/(trunc . ) ] calculations .",
    "all energies are in ev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     when the interaction between electrons and holes is included , excitons with specific excitation energies ( @xmath29 ) are formed to give rise to the prominent photoabsorption peaks .",
    "the binding energy of the lowest - energy exciton is defined as the energy difference between the continuum onset and corresponding excitation energy . for the armchair ( 3,3 )",
    "sic - nt , the optical absorption spectra from the gw+bse calculations is dominated by the discrete exciton peaks [ see the red curves in fig .",
    "the first bright exciton ( @xmath30 ) appearing at @xmath31 ev with a large binding energy ( @xmath32 ) of @xmath33 ev is formed by a mixture of four pair of interband transitions , as indicated by the arrows in fig .",
    "these four different interband transitions couple strongly to make the electron amplitude more localized and highly asymmetric around the hole position located outside the tube but near the c atom , as displayed in the inset in fig .",
    "( b ) , thereby resulting in a strongly bound character of exciton @xmath30 . at the same time , the large electron - hole overlap in the ( 3,3 ) sic - nt lifts the double degeneracy of the @xmath34 exciton in the 2d sic sheet to create the bright @xmath30 exciton and a dark exciton with a higher ( by @xmath35 ev ) excitation energy .",
    "similar excitonic effects are also found in the larger armchair ( 5,5 ) sic - nt ( see table ii ) . however , the lowest optically active exciton in the ( 5,5 ) sic - nt has a smaller binding energy of @xmath36 ev , because the reduced electron - hole overlap due to the decreased curvature .",
    "moreover , apart from the bright bound and resonant excitons shown as red peaks in fig 7(b ) , there also exist many dark excitons among the bright ones .",
    "however , we find no dark exciton below the @xmath30 exciton in the armchair sic - nt . as mentioned before , this can be anticipated from the fact that the isolated sic layer has a direct band gap at the @xmath37-point . in this case , there is no momentum mismatch when the sic sheet is rolled up to form an armchair sic - nt , and hence the possibility of the formation of the optically inactive lowest - energy exciton diminishes@xcite .",
    ", is mainly related to the interband transition indicated as a red - solid arrow in ( a ) whereas the transition by the red - dashed arrow in ( a ) corresponds to the third ( @xmath38 ) bright exciton in ( b ) .",
    "the inset in ( b ) shows the squared electron amplitude ( @xmath39 in an arbitrary unit ) of @xmath30 with the fixed hole position marked by a red sphere .",
    "the si and c atoms are represented by the cyan and yellow spheres , respectively . ]",
    "next , let us concentrate on the excitonic effects on the optical absorption in the small radius zigzag sic - nts . in order to scrutinize the chirality effects , we performed gw+rpa and gw+bse calculations of the zigzag ( 5,0 ) sic - nt with a tube radius comparable to that of the armchair ( 3,3 ) sic - nt .",
    "the quasiparticle band structure and optical polarizability @xmath40 of the ( 5,0 ) sic - nt is displayed in fig .",
    "8 ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . in fig .",
    "8 ( b ) , label @xmath41 denotes the @xmath42th optically allowed excited state .",
    "the inset in fig . 8 ( b ) is a contour plot of the electron charge density distribution of the @xmath30 exciton with respect to a fixed hole position .",
    "like the ( 3,3 ) sic - nt , the photoexcited spectrum of the ( 5,0 ) sic - nt is characterized by the discrete exciton peaks .",
    "the first bright exciton @xmath30 is the most prominent feature in the spectrum , and consists of the different interband transitions near the zone - center @xmath43-point ( represented by the solid arrow ) . as a result , the charge density distribution is not cylindrically symmetric .",
    "similar results are found in the ( 6,0 ) sic - nt , and the corresponding excitation energies are listed in table ii .",
    "interestingly , although the ( 5,0 ) and ( 3,3 ) sic - nts have a similar curvature , the relatively smaller binding energy ( 0.3 ev ) of the @xmath30 exciton in the ( 5,0 ) sic - nt indicates a rather delocalized exciton .",
    "this pronounced chirality effect can be attributed to the considerable orbital rehybridization in the zigzag sic - nts emphaszied above .",
    "this orbital rehybridization induces a significant band - gap reduction giving rise to the increasing of the effective screening , and hence reduces the binding energy .",
    "furthermore , according to the zone - folding scheme for nanotubes , the lowest energy optically active interband transition at the @xmath37 point of the 2d sheet can be folded into the @xmath43 point to form a bright exciton with the lowest excitation energy in zigzag nanotubes . however , in the very small - radius zigzag sic - nts such as the ( 5,0 ) nanotube , the strong curvature - induced orbital rehybridization has brought a higher conduction band down to the gw band gap ( @xmath44 ev ) region [ see fig .",
    "8 ( a ) ] .",
    "since the optical transitions from the top valence bands to this conduction band are dipole - forbiden , some low energy dark excitons including the @xmath45 dark exciton , appear in the small - radius zigzag sic - nts . as shown in table ii , this low - energy @xmath45 dark exciton is also rather localized with a large binding energy , and this could make the zigzag sic - nts candidates for the tunable optical devices for temperature or external field sensors .",
    "finally , we explore the extent of the exciton wavefunction localization in the different sic - nts by comparing the intensity of their electron - hole wavefunctions in real space . in fig .",
    "9 , the isosurface plots of the electron density with the fixed hole position ( the red cross in the figure ) of the first bright exciton ( @xmath30 ) of the armchair sic - nts suggest a significant local distribution in the direction along the circumference of the tube . mixing of excitations to different subband pairs in the small - radius sic - nts is responsible for this tightly bound character .",
    "in addition , a spatial localization of the exciton wavefunction along the tubular direction is also revealed by integrating out the electron coordinates in the perpendicular plane ( red curves in fig .",
    "in contrast with the carbon nanotubes , the deviation from the one - dimensional nature of the low - energy exciton is mainly attributed to the strongly mixing of the interband transitions .",
    "similar tightly bound behavior of the lowest - energy bright exciton has also been discovered in the bn - nts@xcite . in the zigzag sic - nts , we find the similar anisotropic bound nature of the first bright exciton . the slightly broadened distribution of the integrated wavefunction intensity ( see the blue curves in fig .",
    "9 ) suggests a less bound character in the zigzag sic - nts .",
    "the distinct spiky features in the curve are located on the cation ( si atom ) planes and they indicate a charge transfer from an anion ( hole ) to its neighboring cations by photoexcitation . on the other hand ,",
    "the pronounced peak structures are not observed in the armchair sic - nt because of the specific atomic arrangement dictated by its particular chirality .",
    "furthermore , the asymmetric distribution of @xmath46 with respect to the fixed hole position , is a consequence of the different nearest - neighbor cation - anion distances caused by rolling up the ideal symmetric 2d sic sheet .",
    "this curvature - induced spatial symmetry breaking is also responsible for the special nodal - like feature near the hole position in the smallest armchair ( 3,3 ) sic - nt .",
    "nonetheless , by comparing the distribution of the exciton wavefunction of the ( 3,3 ) sic - nt with the larger ( 5,5 ) nanotube , we note that this symmetry breaking will decrease gradually as the curvature decreases or the tube diameter increases .     of the @xmath47 exciton ( see fig . 7 and fig .",
    "8) with the fixed hole position ( indicated by a red cross ) in the armchair ( 3,3 ) and ( 5,5 ) as well as the zigzag ( 5,0 ) and ( 6,0 ) sic - nts .",
    "the corresponding integrated intensities by averaging out the coordinates perpendicular to the tube axis , are also shown . here",
    "the hole position is set at 0 .",
    "the si and c atoms are represented by the cyan and yellow spheres , respectively . ]",
    "in summary , we have employed the state - of - the art many - body gw and gw+bse approaches to study the quasiparticle band structure and optical properties , respectively , of the sic sheet and related sic nanotubes .",
    "first of all , we find a direct quasiparticle band gap for the isolated 2d sic sheet .",
    "our gw band structure calculations show that rather complicated orbital - dependent self - energy corrections are needed in obtaining accurate quasiparticle properties for the isolated sic layer .",
    "the profile of the optical spectra is modified dramatically when the electron - hole interaction is included .",
    "in particular , a strongly bright bound exciton with a large binding energy ( 1.17 ev ) is found to dominate the optical spectrum , because of the enhanced overlap between the electron and hole orbitals due to reduced - dimensionality effects and also the existence of vacuum region which reduces the effective screening in the sic sheet .    secondly , the quasiparticle band structure of the small - radius armchair and zigzag sic - nts is systematically studied within the gw approximation .",
    "our detailed analysis on the charge density distributions reveals that a curvate - induced orbital rehybridization plays a vital role on determining the band gap of the small - radius sic - nts with different chiralities at both the lda and gw levels .",
    "in particular , the quasiparticle band gaps as a function of tube diameter behave very differently , depending on the chirality of the sic - nts concerned .    finally , the calculated photoexcited spectra are consisted of discrete exciton peaks , thereby indicating strong excitonic effects in both the armchair and zigzag sic - nts .",
    "the optical absorption spectra of the small radius armchair and zigzag sic - nts are dominated by the first bright bound exciton @xmath30 with a significant binding energy up to @xmath22.0 ev . the highly asymmetric charge distribution of the exciton @xmath30 in the ( 3,3 ) sic - nt is found to be a consequence of the strong coupling of the four optically allowed inter - subband transitions .",
    "interestingly , we also find a quasi - zero dimensional bound character of the first bright exciton in the sic - nts and curvature - induced symmetry breaking affects the shape and size of this bound exciton .",
    "moreover , our gw and bse calculations demonstrate that the simple zone - folding approach fails in predicting the low energy exciton characters in very small zigzag sic - nts , mainly because of the strong curvature - induced orbital rehybridization in these nanotubes .",
    "we believe that the large excitation energy of @xmath0 ev of the first bright exciton , with no dark exciton below it , may make the small - radius armchair sic - nts candidates for optical devices working in the uv regime .",
    "in contrast , the numerous dark excitons below @xmath30 in the zigzag sic - nts may lead to potential applications in tunable optelectric devices ranging from infrared to uv frequencies by external perturbations .",

    "<S> remarkably , the excited electron amplitude of the exciton wavefunction is found to peak on the si atoms near the hole position ( which is on the c site ) in the zigzag sic - nts , indicating a charge transfer from an anion ( hole ) to its neighboring cations by photoexcitation . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , this pronounced peak structure disappear in the exciton wavefunction in the armchair sic - nts . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in the armchair sic - nts , the bound exciton wavefunctions are more localized and also strongly cylindrically asymmetric . </S>",
    "<S> the large excitation energy of @xmath0 ev of the first bright exciton with no dark exciton below it , suggests that the small - radius armchair sic - nts be useful for optical devices working in the uv regime . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the zigzag sic - nts have many dark excitons below the first bright exciton and hence may have potential applications in tunable optoelectric devices ranging from infrared to uv frequencies by external perturbations . </S>"
