    "the nature of the transition between quark and hadron degrees of freedom in qcd is one of the most fundamental problems in strong interaction physics .",
    "this transition has been extensively explored within nonperturbative models of qcd , which , while retaining some of the apposite features of qcd , make simplifying assumptions that allow approximate solutions to be found @xcite .",
    "considerable progress has also been made recently in calculating hadronic properties directly from qcd via lattice gauge theory , and much is anticipated from this approach in the near future with significant advances in computing power available @xcite .",
    "it is clear , however , that while a quantitative description of hadronic structure from first principles in qcd is still some time away , phenomenological input will remain crucial in guiding our understanding for the foreseeable future .    of course , assuming qcd can ultimately describe the physics of hadrons , the transition from quarks and gluons to hadrons can be considered trivial in principle from the point of view of quark  hadron duality . so long as one has access to a complete set of states , it is immaterial whether one calculates physical quantities in terms of elementary quark or effective hadron degrees of freedom . in practice , however , truncations are unavoidable , and it is precisely the consequences of working with incomplete or truncated basis states that allows one to expose the interesting dynamics that drives the quark  hadron transition .",
    "the duality between quarks and hadrons reveals itself in spectacular fashion through the phenomenon of bloom - gilman duality in inclusive lepton ",
    "nucleon scattering , @xmath3 . here",
    "the inclusive @xmath4 structure function of the nucleon measured in the region dominated by low - lying nucleon resonances is observed to follow a global scaling curve describing the high energy data , to which the resonance structure function averages @xcite .",
    "the equivalence of the averaged resonance and scaling structure functions in addition appears to hold for each prominent resonance region separately , suggesting that the resonance ",
    "scaling duality also exists to some extent locally .",
    "the correspondence between exclusive and inclusive observables in electroproduction was studied even before the advent of qcd @xcite . within qcd",
    ", the appearance of duality for the moments of structure functions can be related through the operator product expansion ( ope ) to the size of high twist corrections to the scaling structure function @xcite , which reflect the importance of long - range multi - parton correlations in the hadron @xcite . the apparent early onset of bloom - gilman duality for the proton structure function seen in recent jefferson lab experiments @xcite indicates the dominance of single - quark scattering to rather low momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "it is not _ a priori _ clear , however , whether this is due to an overall suppression of coherent effects in inclusive scattering , or because of fortuitous cancellations of possibly large corrections . indeed , there are some indications from models of qcd that the workings of duality may be rather different in the neutron than in the proton @xcite , or for spin - independent and spin - dependent structure functions .",
    "from another direction , one knows from the large @xmath5 limit of qcd @xcite that duality is an inevitable consequence of quark confinement ; in the mesonic sector one can prove ( at least in 1 + 1 dimensions ) that an exactly scaling structure function can be constructed from towers of infinitesimally narrow mesonic @xmath6 resonances @xcite .",
    "this proof - of - principle example provides a heuristic guide to the appearance of the qualitative features of bloom - gilman duality , and has been used to motivate more elaborate studies of duality in quark models , even though application to the baryon sector is somewhat more involved @xcite . given that bloom - gilman duality is empirically established only for baryons ( specifically , the proton ) , while the application of theoretical models is generally more straightforward in the meson sector , a natural question to consider is whether , and how , duality manifests itself phenomenologically for the simplest @xmath6 system in qcd  the pion .    as the lightest @xmath6 bound state",
    ", the pion plays a special role in qcd .",
    "indeed , in nature the pion presents itself as somewhat of a dichotomy : on the one hand , its anomalously small mass suggests that it should be identified with the pseudo - goldstone mode of dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry in qcd ; on the other , it ought to be described equally well from the qcd lagrangian in terms of current quarks , with particularly attractive forces acting in the @xmath7 channel .",
    "the complementarity of these pictures may also reflect , loosely - speaking , a kind of duality between the effective , hadronic description based on symmetries , and a microscopic description in terms of partons .",
    "this duality is effectively exploited in calculations of hadron properties via the qcd sum rule method @xcite , in which results obtained in terms of hadronic variables using dispersion relations are matched with those of the ope using free quarks .    in this paper",
    "we connect a number of these themes in an attempt to further develop and elucidate the issue of quark - hadron duality for the pion , focusing in particular on insights that can be gained from phenomenological constraints .",
    "specifically , we shall examine the possible connections between the structure of the pion as revealed in exclusive scattering , and that which is measured in inclusive reactions .",
    "the latter can in principle be reconstructed given sufficient knowledge of the form factors which parameterize transitions from the ground state pion to excited states .",
    "we do not attempt this rather challenging task directly ; instead , we use the tools of the ope to organize moments of the pion structure function according to ( matrix elements of ) local operators of a given twist .",
    "this exercise is possible because the structure function of the pion has been determined from drell - yan @xmath8 scattering data at high @xmath0 .",
    "of course , the absence of fixed pion targets means that the structure of the pion at low excitation mass @xmath9 is not known , with the exception of the elastic pion contribution , which has been accurately measured for @xmath10  gev@xmath11 in @xmath12 electroproduction off the proton .    to complement the dearth of data on specific @xmath13 transitions above threshold ( but below the deep inelastic continuum ) , we consider a simple model for the pion structure function in which the low @xmath9 spectrum is dominated by the elastic and @xmath2 transitions , on top of a continuum which is estimated by evolving the leading twist structure function to lower @xmath0 .",
    "the discussion at low @xmath9 is necessarily more qualitative than for the corresponding case of the nucleon @xcite where ample data exist .",
    "however , even within the current limitations , this analysis provides an estimate of the possible size of higher twist effects in the pion structure function , and the role of the resonance region in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) from the pion .",
    "preliminary results for the higher twist corrections have been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we shall extend that analysis by considering the extent to which local duality may be valid in the pion structure function , and possible constraints on the @xmath14 behavior which can be inferred from the elastic channels .",
    "this study is timely in view of experiments on the pion elastic @xcite and transition @xcite form factors being planned or analyzed at jefferson lab , which will probe the interplay between soft and hard scattering from the pion and the onset of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) behavior .",
    "furthermore , recent measurements of the inclusive pion structure function via the semi - inclusive charge - exchange reaction , @xmath15 , at hera have yielded some unexpected results at low @xmath1 @xcite , and new experiments over a large range of @xmath1 are being planned at jefferson lab at lower @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this paper discusses the possible interelations between these measurements , in the quest for obtaining a consistent , unified description of the structure of the pion in electromagnetic scattering .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "after briefly reviewing in section  ii the definitions and kinematics of inclusive lepton scattering from the pion , in section  iii we begin the discussion by focusing on the special case of elastic scattering .",
    "we construct an efficient parameterization of the elastic pion form factor in the space - like region consistent with the @xmath16 and @xmath17 constraints .",
    "an analysis of moments of the pion structure function is presented in section  iv , including the extraction of higher twists and a discussion of the role of the resonance region .",
    "some of these results appeared in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we carefully examine the large @xmath1 region , which is important for high moments , and compare predictions of several models for the leading and higher twist contributions to the pion structure function as @xmath14 .",
    "the relation of the structure function at @xmath18 with the @xmath17 dependence of elastic form factors is discussed in section  v , where we test the hypothesis of local bloom - gilman duality between the scaling structure function and the exclusive elastic and @xmath2 transition contributions .",
    "concluding remarks and a survey of future avenues for developments of the issues presented are outlined in section  vi .",
    "inclusive scattering of an electron , or any charged lepton , from a pion , @xmath19 , is described by the pion hadronic tensor , @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 and the pion and virtual photon four - momenta , respectively , and @xmath23 is the momentum of the hadronic final state with invariant mass squared @xmath24 , with @xmath25 the energy transfer in the pion rest frame and @xmath26 the pion mass .",
    "the hadronic tensor can be parameterized in terms of two structure functions , @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are in general functions of two variables , for instance @xmath25 and @xmath30 . in the limit as @xmath31 and @xmath32 , with",

    "radiative qcd corrections introduce explicit dependence of @xmath37 on the strong coupling constant , @xmath38 .",
    "while only transversely polarized photons contribute to the @xmath39 structure function , @xmath40 , the @xmath41 structure function receives both transverse and longitudinal contributions , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the transverse and longitudinal photoabsorption cross sections , respectively .",
    "the inclusive spectrum begins with the elastic peak at @xmath45 , or equivalently , @xmath46 . because the pion is spinless , elastic scattering from the pion contributes only to the longitudinal cross section , so that the elastic contribution to the @xmath39 structure function vanishes .",
    "the elastic contribution to the @xmath41 structure function is proportional to the square of the elastic pion form factor , @xmath47 , @xmath48 where @xmath47 is the elastic pion form factor . as the most basic observable characterizing the composite nature of the lightest bound state in qcd ,",
    "the elastic form factor of the pion is of fundamental importance to our understanding of hadronic structure . in the approximation that the pion wave function is dominated by its lowest @xmath6 fock state ,",
    "the pion form factor becomes amenable to rigorous qcd analysis .",
    "indeed , it is well known that the asymptotic behavior of the pion form factor is calculable in pqcd @xcite , @xmath49 where @xmath50  mev is the pion decay constant .",
    "current data on @xmath51 , summarized in fig .  1 , indicate that there are large soft contributions still at @xmath10  gev@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the low @xmath0 data are obtained from scattering pions off atomic electrons @xcite , while the higher @xmath0 data are taken from @xmath52 measurements at cea / cornell @xcite , desy @xcite and jlab @xcite . for comparison , the leading order pqcd prediction from eq .",
    "( [ fpipqcd ] ) is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "although the region of applicability of the pqcd result is _ a priori _ unknown , the pion represents the best hope of observing the onset of asymptotic behavior experimentally ( the corresponding pqcd calculation of the nucleon form factors significantly underestimates the data at the same @xmath0 ) .",
    "there have been a number of calculations of the elastic pion form factor at low @xmath0 , for instance using the qcd sum rule approach @xcite . rather than rely on any specific model , however , in this analysis we use empirical data to calculate the elastic contribution to the pion structure function .",
    "for convenience , and for later use in sections  iv and v , we present a simple parameterization of the pion elastic form factor data in the space - like region , which is valid over the entire range of @xmath0 currently accessible , and smoothly interpolates between the pqcd and photoproduction limits . for the latter , the pion form factor at low @xmath0",

    "the higher twist contributions @xmath73 represent matrix elements of operators involving both quark and gluon fields , and are suppressed by additional powers of @xmath70 .",

    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) demonstrated that the onset of quark - hadron duality is governed directly by the size of the higher twist matrix elements .",
    "in particular , duality implies the existence of a region in the ( @xmath79 , @xmath0 ) space in which the moments of the structure function are dominated by low mass resonances , and where the higher twist contributions are neither dominant nor negligible . for the case of the proton @xmath4 structure function , even though there are large contributions from the resonance region , conventionally defined as @xmath80  gev , to the @xmath81 moment ( @xmath82 at @xmath83  gev@xmath11 ) , the higher twists contribute only around 10 - 20% to the cross section at the same @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "iv.a .    on the other hand ,",
    "as alluded to above , the extraction of the pion structure function requires as input the parton distributions in the nucleon .",
    "since the bulk of the data for @xmath191 corresponds to a nucleon light - cone momentum fraction @xmath1920.1 , errors may be introduced into the analysis through poor knowledge of the sea quark , or ( at higher order ) gluon , distributions in the nucleon .",
    "furthermore , because the data are taken on nuclear targets ( e.g. tungsten for the e615 experiment ) , nuclear effects may give rise to corrections to the nucleon quark distributions , especially in the region @xmath193 , where nuclear shadowing is known to play an important role @xcite .",
    "the effects of using more modern nucleon parton distributions , and including nuclear corrections in the analysis , are currently being investigated @xcite .",
    "it may also be that the asymptotic behavior does not set in until @xmath1 is very close to 1 , and that the functional form ( [ e615fit ] ) is simply too restrictive to adequately reflect this behavior , in which case a more sophisticated parameterization would be required .",
    "further , nonobservation of the predicted counting rule behavior may not necessarily imply a breakdown of pqcd .",
    "the derivation of the counting rules for large-@xmath1 structure functions from feynman diagrams in terms of hard gluon exchanges between quarks involves an infrared cut - off mass parameter , @xmath194 , which regulates the integrals when @xmath195 @xcite .",
    "although an analysis based on pqcd should be valid also for @xmath196 , the counting rule results are sensitive to the parameter , @xmath194 , and comparison with phenomenology requires a nonzero value @xcite .",
    "regardless of the ultimate @xmath14 behavior of @xmath41 extracted from data , it is instructive to examine whether the asymptotic inclusive  exclusive relations between the pion structure function and the pion elastic and transition form factors at large @xmath0 can provide additional constraints . in the next section we use local quark - hadron duality to study these relations in more detail .",
    "there has been a revival of interest recently in the phenomenon of bloom - gilman duality in electron ",
    "nucleon scattering .",
    "this has been stimulated largely by recent high precision measurements @xcite at jefferson  lab of the @xmath4 structure function of the proton , which demonstrated that duality works remarkably well for each of the prominent low - lying resonance regions , including the elastic @xcite , as well as for the integrated structure function , to rather low values of @xmath0 .",
    "ongoing and planned future studies will focus on duality in other structure functions , such as @xmath127 @xcite and @xmath197 @xcite , and for hadrons other than the proton .    while the existence of local quark - hadron duality appears inevitable in qcd at asymptotically large momenta @xcite , it is not _ a priori _ clear that it should work at finite @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , there are reasons why at low @xmath0 it should not work at all @xcite , and its appearance may in principle be due to accidental cancellations ( due to quark charges in the proton @xcite , for instance ) of possibly large higher twist effects .",
    "a systematic study of local duality for other hadrons , such as the pion , is therefore crucial to revealing the true origin of this phenomenon .    shortly after the original observations of bloom - gilman duality for the proton @xcite , generalizations to the case of the pion",
    "were explored . by extending the finite - energy sum rules @xcite devised for the proton duality studies , moffat and snell derived a local duality sum rule relating the elastic pion form factor with the scaling structure function of the pion @xcite , @xmath198 ^ 2 & \\approx & \\int_1^{\\omega_{\\rm max } } d\\omega\\ \\nu w_2^\\pi(\\omega)\\ , \\label{local}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath199 is a function of the scaling variable @xmath200 .",

    "the agreement appears remarkably good . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnitude of the form factor depends somewhat on the precise value chosen for @xmath204 , so the agreement in fig .",
    "6 should not be taken too literally .",
    "nevertheless , the shape of the form factor is determined by the @xmath1 dependence of the structure function at large @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , while a @xmath156 behavior leads to a similar @xmath0 dependence to that for the e615 fit , assuming a @xmath139 behavior gives a form factor which drops more rapidly with @xmath0 .",
    "this simply reflects the kinematic constraint @xmath205 at fixed @xmath9 .    although the apparent phenomenological success of the local duality relation ( [ local ] ) is alluring , there are theoretical reasons why its foundations may be questioned .",
    "in fact , the workings of local duality for the pion are even more intriguing than for the nucleon . because it has spin 0 , elastic scattering from the pion contributes only to the longitudinal cross section ( @xmath206 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the spin 1/2 nature of quarks guarantees that the deep inelastic structure function of the pion is dominated at large @xmath0 by the transverse cross section @xcite .",
    "taken at face value , the relation ( [ local ] ) would suggest a nontrivial duality relation between longitudinal and transverse cross sections . whether local duality holds individually for longitudinal and transverse cross sections , or for their sum ,",
    "is currently being investigated experimentally .",
    "indications from proton data are that indeed some sort of duality holds for both the transverse and longitudinal structure functions of the proton individually @xcite .    while the elastic form factor of the pion is purely longitudinal , the @xmath207 transition is purely transverse .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that the average of the pion elastic and @xmath2 transition form factors may instead dual the deep inelastic pion structure function at @xmath18 . if we take the simple model used in sec .",

    "the resonance / dis ratio is also shown for @xmath216  gev ( dotted curves ) . in this case",
    "the agreement is better for @xmath1263  gev@xmath11 , with the ratio being @xmath217 below unity for @xmath2156  gev@xmath11 .",
    "given the simple nature of the model used for the excitation spectrum , and the poor knowledge of the @xmath2 transition form factor , as well as of the pion elastic form factor beyond @xmath218  gev@xmath11 , the comparison can only be viewed as qualitative .",
    "however , the agreement between the dis and resonance contributions appears promising .",
    "clearly , data on the inclusive @xmath92 spectrum at low @xmath9 would be invaluable for testing the local duality hypothesis more quantitatively .",
    "in addition , measurement of the individual transverse and longitudinal cross sections of the pion , using rosenbluth separation techniques , would allow duality to be tested separately for the longitudinal and transverse structure functions of the pion .",
    "understanding the structure of the pion represents a fundamental challenge in qcd .",
    "high energy scattering experiments reveal its quark and gluon substructure , while at low energies its role as a goldstone boson mode associated with chiral symmetry breaking in qcd is essential in describing the long - range structure and interactions of hadrons .",
    "we have sought to elucidate the structure of the pion by considering its response to electromagnetic probes , focusing in particular on the connection between inclusive and exclusive channels .",
    "the relation between the pion structure function and the pion elastic and transition form factors has been studied in the context of quark - hadron duality .",
    "moments of the pion structure function have been evaluated , and the role of the resonance region studied , assuming that the low @xmath9 resonant spectrum is dominated by the elastic and @xmath2 transitions .",
    "the contribution of the resonance region ( @xmath208  gev ) to the lowest moment of @xmath41 is @xmath219 at @xmath218  gev@xmath11 , and only falls below 10% for @xmath125  gev@xmath11 .",
    "the elastic component , while negligible for @xmath220  gev@xmath11 , is comparable to the leading twist contribution at @xmath117  gev@xmath11 . combined , this means that the higher twist corrections to the @xmath81 moment are @xmath219 at @xmath123  gev@xmath11 , @xmath221 at @xmath105  gev@xmath11 , and only become insignificant beyond @xmath67  gev@xmath11 .",
    "uncertainties on these estimates are mainly due to the poor knowledge of the inclusive pion spectrum at low @xmath9 , which limits the extent to which duality in the pion can be tested quantitatively .",
    "only the elastic form factor has been accurately measured to @xmath218  gev@xmath11 , although at larger @xmath0 it is poorly constrained .",
    "the inclusive pion spectrum can be extracted from data from the semi - inclusive charge - exchange reaction , @xmath15 , at low @xmath91 , for instance at jefferson lab @xcite .",
    "this could also allow one to determine the individual exclusive channels at low @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , a rosenbluth separation would allow the transverse and longitudinal structure functions to be extracted .    within the current uncertainties ,",
    "the higher twist effects in the pion appear larger than the analogous corrections extracted from moments of the nucleon structure functions @xcite .",
    "this can be generically understood in terms of the larger intrinsic transverse momentum of quarks , which governs the scale of the @xmath70 corrections , in the pion than in nucleon , associated with the smaller pion confinement radius .",
    "the implication is that duality would therefore be expected to set in later ( at larger @xmath0 ) for the pion than for the nucleon .",
    "higher twist effects have also been observed in the pion structure function at large @xmath1 by the e615 collaboration at fermilab @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence and angular distribution of @xmath133 pairs produced in @xmath8 collisions at @xmath18 suggests a value @xmath132  gev@xmath11 , which is larger than the typical quark transverse momentum in the nucleon ( @xmath222(500  mev ) ) .",
    "on the other hand , the measured @xmath1 dependence appears to be harder than that predicted by counting rules @xcite or models based on perturbative one gluon exchange @xcite , favoring a @xmath156 shape over a @xmath139 dependence .",
    "a reanalysis @xcite of the drell - yan data to take into account nuclear corrections and updated sea quark distributions in the nucleon , which are used as input into the analysis , is necessary for a definitive assessment of the validity of the various approaches .",
    "additional modification of the @xmath14 behavior due to sudakov - like effects @xcite may also need to be considered before drawing final conclusions about the implications of the observed @xmath14 dependence .",
    "there are also plans to measure @xmath41 in semi - inclusive reactions over a range of @xmath1 at jefferson lab @xcite to confirm the drell - yan and semi - inclusive hera measurements , which should allow a more thorough exploration of the higher twist effects at lower @xmath0 .",
    "the specific @xmath14 behavior of the pion structure function has consequences for the @xmath0 dependence of the elastic pion form factor , if one assumes the validity of local quark - hadron duality for the pion .",
    "in particular , using parameterizations of the drell - yan structure function data , the existing data on @xmath47 can be fitted if the upper limit of the integration region above the elastic peak extends to @xmath202  gev .",
    "analogous fits with a @xmath139 shape fall off too rapidly with @xmath0 and do not fit @xmath47 as well .    on the other hand",
    ", there may be limitations of the extent to which local duality can hold for the pion , as such duality implies a nontrivial relationship between the longitudinal and transverse cross sections .",
    "it may in fact be more appropriate to examine whether the sum of the longitudinal ( elastic ) and transverse ( @xmath2 transition ) contributions duals the dis structure function at low @xmath9 .",
    "using phenomenological models for the @xmath2 form factor , our estimate for the sum of the lowest - lying resonant contributions is in qualitative agreement with the corresponding scaling contribution in the same @xmath9 interval .",
    "however , empirical information on the strength and @xmath0 dependence of @xmath94 is necessary for a more quantitative test .",
