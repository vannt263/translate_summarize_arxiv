    "a screw  like , that is , helical motion of an electrically conducting fluid is capable of dynamo action .",
    "this has been first theoretically shown by @xcite .",
    "later , in 1999 , it was experimentally demonstrated in the liquid sodium facility of the institute for physics in riga ( latvia ) @xcite .",
    "it is also the background of another liquid sodium experiment which is under preparation in the institute for continuous media mechanics in perm ( russia ) ( denisov _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 , frick _",
    "_ 2001 , 2002 ) @xcite .    in this experiment a torus - shaped vessel filled with liquid sodium is rotated about its symmetry axis and then suddenly stopped . after the stop a flow of sodium occurs inside the vessel and decays in the course of time .",
    "due to diverters , that is , proper arrangements of blades inside the vessel , the flow becomes helical . in this way",
    "the possibility of a dynamo of ponomarenko type arises for a certain time interval .",
    "the large radius of the torus is about 0.40 m and the small one about 0.12 m. rotation rates up to 50 rps are envisaged .",
    "estimates show that magnetic reynolds numbers sufficient for dynamo action are indeed feasible .",
    "the critical magnetic reynolds number is definitely higher than 10 .",
    "for liquid sodium the hydrodynamic reynolds number exceeds the magnetic reynolds number by a factor of about @xmath1 .",
    "therefore in the case of a dynamo the fluid flow is necessarily turbulent , that is , may be considered as consisting of a main flow and a superimposed turbulence .",
    "the turbulence affects the dynamo in two ways .",
    "firstly it influences the profile of the main flow .",
    "secondly it leads to small  scale induction effects .",
    "in particular the turbulence will enlarge the effective magnetic diffusivity of the fluid , what raises the dynamo threshold .",
    "likewise other small  scale induction effects will occur . as a consequence of helical features of the turbulence an @xmath0effect or related effects are possible .",
    "basically they could also support the screw dynamo or even open the possibility of another type of dynamo .    in this paper",
    "we want to estimate these direct influences of turbulence on the electromagnetic field on the basis of mean  field electrodynamics .",
    "we will rely on a recent general calculation of the mean electromotive force due to turbulence @xcite , which was partially motivated by this experiment . in section [ concept ]",
    "we describe the general concept of our investigation . in section [ structure ]",
    "we discuss possible structures of the mean electromotive force which can be concluded from symmetry arguments , and in section [ results ] we explain results of more detailed calculations . on this basis",
    "we deliver in section [ estimates ] estimates for the influence of the turbulence on the dynamo . finally in section [ summary ] the main results are summarized .",
    "let us first recall some ideas of the mean  field concept which are important for the following ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we start from the induction equation that governs the behavior of the magnetic field @xmath2 in an electrically conducting fluid , @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the velocity of the fluid and @xmath5 its magnetic diffusivity , which is assumed to be constant .    the velocity @xmath4 and , as a consequence , also the magnetic field @xmath2 are assumed to consist of large  scale parts and small  scale turbulent fluctuations .",
    "we define the mean magnetic and velocity fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 as averages over space or time scales larger than those of the turbulence and put @xmath8 analogously to @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that the reynolds averaging rules apply . taking the average of equation ( [ eq03 ] ) we obtain the mean - field induction equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an electromotive force due to the fluctuations of magnetic field and velocity , @xmath12    the equation for @xmath13 resulting from ( [ eq03 ] ) and ( [ eq05 ] ) allows us to conclude that @xmath11 is determined by @xmath7 , @xmath14 and @xmath6 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath11 at a given point in space and time depends not only on @xmath7 , @xmath14 and @xmath6 at this point but also on their behavior in a certain neighborhood of this point .",
    "we adopt the frequently used assumption that @xmath6 varies only weakly in space and time so that @xmath11 in a given point depends on @xmath6 only via its components and their first spatial derivatives in this point .",
    "then @xmath11 can be represented in the form @xmath15 with tensors @xmath16 and @xmath17 being averaged quantities determined by @xmath7 and @xmath14 . here and",
    "in the following we refer to a cartesian co  ordinate system @xmath18 and adopt the summation convention .",
    "relation ( [ eq09 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath19 ( see rdler 1980 , 2000 ) , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are symmetric tensors of the second rank , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are vectors , and @xmath24 is a tensor of the third rank , all depending on @xmath7 and @xmath14 only .",
    "@xmath25 is the symmetric part of the gradient tensor of @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath26 .",
    "notations like @xmath27 or @xmath28 are used in the sense of @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "the term with @xmath20 in ( [ eq11 ] ) describes the @xmath0effect , which is in general anisotropic , that with @xmath22 a transport of mean magnetic flux by the turbulence .",
    "the terms with @xmath21 and @xmath23 can be interpreted by introducing a modified magnetic diffusivity , again in general anisotropic .",
    "they are usually accompanied by the @xmath24 term , which allows no simple interpretation .",
    "we consider the ponomarenko dynamo here in its original cylindrical geometry .",
    "as observed in other investigations this provides a reasonable approximation for the situation in a torus even for aspect ratios as large as in the planned device @xcite .",
    "we assume that it is primarily a helical mean flow described by the mean velocity @xmath7 which generates or maintains the mean magnetic field @xmath6 . referring to a proper cylindrical co  ordinate system @xmath31 we put @xmath32",
    "as mentioned above we will study the influence of the turbulence , that is , of the velocity field @xmath14 , on the mean magnetic field @xmath6 in the framework of mean  field electrodynamics .    for a more detailed discussion of the mean electromotive force @xmath11 caused by the turbulence and for its calculation",
    "we change temporarily from the frame of reference in which ( [ eq01 ] ) applies to another one rotating about the axis @xmath33 and moving along it .",
    "let us consider @xmath11 in a given point at the surface @xmath34 .",
    "the moving frame is then fixed such that the mean velocity of the fluid at the surface @xmath34 is equal to zero .",
    "the result for @xmath11 found in this rotating system , considered as a vector with the usual transformation properties , applies in the original frame of reference as well . in the moving frame",
    "the mean velocity @xmath7 has , again in the cylindrical co  ordinate system introduced above , the form @xmath35 in contrast to the original frame , in the rotating one a coriolis force occurs , which is defined by an angular velocity @xmath36 , given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 means the unit vector in the @xmath39 direction of the cylindrical co  ordinate system .",
    "consider now @xmath11 in the moving frame at a point with @xmath40 .",
    "then @xmath11 and so the quantities @xmath16 and @xmath17 , or @xmath20 , @xmath22 , @xmath21 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , depend on @xmath7 and @xmath14 in a certain neighborhood of this point .",
    "the dependence on @xmath14 implies again a dependence on @xmath7 and of course also a dependence on @xmath36 .",
    "we restrict our attention now to the case in which @xmath7 varies only weakly in the relevant neighborhood and assume that its behavior can be there sufficiently precisely described by the gradient tensor @xmath41 , with respect to cartesian co  ordinates defined by @xmath42 . in addition we assume until further notice that the turbulent fluctuations @xmath14 deviate from a homogeneous isotropic mirror  symmetric turbulence only as a consequence of the gradient @xmath41 of @xmath7 and the coriolis force defined by @xmath36",
    ". we may split @xmath41 into its symmetric and antisymmetric parts .",
    "the first one is the rate of strain tensor @xmath43 , that is , @xmath44 .",
    "it describes the deforming motion near the point considered . due to the incompressibility of the fluid we have @xmath45 and therefore @xmath46 .",
    "the second part , @xmath47 , given by @xmath48 , corresponds to a rigid body rotation of the fluid near this point .",
    "we may represent it according to @xmath49 by a vector @xmath50 . until further notice we do not use specifications of @xmath43 and @xmath51 according to ( [ eq15 ] ) .",
    "they will be introduced only later .",
    "we now utilize the symmetry properties of the basic equations governing @xmath2 and @xmath4 , or @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , from which @xmath11 and so the quantities @xmath16 and @xmath17 , or @xmath20 , @xmath22 , @xmath21 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , have to be derived .",
    "they allow two important conclusions ( see also , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the first reads that these quantities can not contain any other construction elements than the isotropic tensors @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the vectors @xmath36 and @xmath51 and the tensor @xmath43 .",
    "the second uses the distinction between polar and axial vectors as @xmath4 and @xmath2 , respectively , and between true and pseudo tensors .",
    "it reads that @xmath16 and @xmath17 , further @xmath20 and @xmath24 are pseudo tensors , @xmath21 is a true tensor , @xmath22 a polar vector , and @xmath23 an axial vector .",
    "it is then important that @xmath36 and @xmath51 are axial vectors and @xmath43 is a true tensor .",
    "let us consider first @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the mentioned construction elements @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath36 , @xmath51 and @xmath43 allow us neither to built a pseudo tensor of the second rank nor a polar vector .",
    "that is , we have @xmath56 we stress that this applies independently of any assumptions concerning linearity in @xmath36 , @xmath51 and @xmath43 like those we will introduce below .",
    "in contrast to this there are several non  zero contributions to @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we give here only those of them which are linear in @xmath36 , @xmath51 and @xmath43 , @xmath60 the coefficients @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 @xmath65 are determined by @xmath14 but do not depend on @xmath36 , @xmath51 and @xmath43 .",
    "because of @xmath66 , terms of @xmath59 containing @xmath67 would not contribute to @xmath11 and have therefore been dropped .    as a consequence of ( [ eq19 ] ) and ( [ eq21 ] ) we have @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a tensor of the third rank defined by @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath61 and @xmath62 terms in ( [ eq23 ] ) make that the mean  field diffusivity deviates from the original , that is , molecular magnetic diffusivity of the fluid . due to",
    "the @xmath62 term the mean  field diffusivity becomes anisotropic .",
    "the @xmath63 and @xmath71 terms , too , can be discussed as contributions to the mean  field diffusivity .",
    "they lead to skew  symmetric contributions to the diffusivity tensor . in another context",
    "the effect described by the @xmath63 term has been called  @xmath72effect \" .",
    "it has been shown that this effect in combination with a differential rotation , here a dependence of @xmath73 or @xmath74 , is able to establish a dynamo @xcite .",
    "the @xmath71 term describes an effect analogous to the @xmath75effect , which has been revealed only recently @xcite .",
    "it occurs even in the absence of the coriolis force as consequence of a shear in the mean motion .",
    "the possibility of a dynamo due to this effect is still under debate , see section  [ subsec53 ] .",
    "we refrain from discussing the @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath65 terms here .",
    "let us now relax the assumption that the original turbulence is homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "we admit an inhomogeneity and an anisotropy due to a gradient of the turbulence intensity and introduce a vector @xmath78 in the direction of this gradient by putting @xmath79 .",
    "then we have to add @xmath78 , which is a polar vector , to the above  mentioned construction elements of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 . as a consequence @xmath20 and @xmath22",
    "can well be non - zero .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we assume that the influence of @xmath78 on @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 is so weak that they are at most of first order in @xmath78 .",
    "we have then @xmath80 whereas ( [ eq21 ] ) remains unchanged .",
    "the general form of @xmath11 reads now @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a symmetric tensor defined by @xmath83 . in the following the induction effects described by the individual contributions to @xmath11",
    "are called @xmath84effect , @xmath85effect , @xmath64 @xmath65effect or , more summarizing , @xmath0effects , @xmath86effects , @xmath64 @xmath87effects .",
    "the occurrence of an @xmath0effect as a consequence of the gradient of the turbulence intensity and the coriolis force , that is , of @xmath78 and @xmath36 , is known for a long time .",
    "the possibility of an @xmath0effect due to a combination of @xmath78 and @xmath51 , or of @xmath78 and @xmath43 , has however been revealed only recently @xcite .",
    "likewise the @xmath88effect and its modification by the coriolis force , that is @xmath36 , is known for a long time , but modifications by @xmath51 and @xmath43 have been found only in the last  mentioned investigations .",
    "we still remain in the co  moving frame defined above , in which @xmath7 is given by ( [ eq15 ] ) , and consider a point with @xmath34 . as a consequence of ( [ eq15 ] ) both @xmath51 and @xmath43 take specific forms .",
    "zero components of @xmath51 are @xmath89 and @xmath90 . as can be concluded with the help of the relations in the appendix the only non ",
    "zero elements of @xmath43 are @xmath91 and @xmath92 . as for @xmath36",
    "we refer to ( [ eq17 ] ) .    in view of the perm dynamo experiment",
    "the simplest assumption on @xmath78 is that it is a radial vector . in this case",
    "the tensor @xmath20 has a remarkable peculiarity .",
    "the terms with @xmath93 and @xmath94 disappear . in the cylindrical co ",
    "ordinate system @xmath20 has the form @xmath95 @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are , of course , measured in the rotating frame of reference .",
    "all diagonal elements of @xmath20 are equal to zero .",
    "therefore a mean magnetic field in @xmath39 direction does not generate any mean electromotive force in @xmath99 or @xmath39 direction .",
    "the last statement remains true even if we relax the assumption on linearity with respect to @xmath78 .    in this context experiments with torus ",
    "shaped devices similar to but smaller than that prepared for the dynamo experiment are of interest . in an experiment with water instead of sodium clearly helical small - scale motions have been observed @xcite .",
    "this suggests the existence of an @xmath0effect in the conducting fluid . in the case of a complete @xmath0effect an azimuthal mean magnetic field leads to a mean electromotive force with a non  zero azimuthal component",
    "however , our above result concerning @xmath20 , with the @xmath39 direction interpreted as the azimuthal one , does not predict such a component .",
    "the existence of helical motions alone is not sufficient for the occurrence of a complete @xmath0effect .",
    "another experiment with gallium instead of sodium was carried out , too @xcite .",
    "it clearly confirmed that there is indeed no azimuthal electromotive force or electric current due to an azimuthal magnetic field .",
    "our considerations on the structure of the electromotive force @xmath11 did not provide us with relations between the coefficients @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and the parameters of the turbulent flow .",
    "we rely here on recent calculations of these coefficients presented in detail in a paper by @xcite .",
    "they were carried out just under the restrictions introduced above , namely that @xmath11 is only weakly influenced by the coriolis force and the gradient of the mean velocity so that it is linear in @xmath36 , @xmath51 and @xmath43 . in addition , again in the sense of restrictions already made , it was assumed that all mean quantities determining @xmath11 vary only weakly in space and time so that it is also linear in the operator @xmath102 acting on quantities like @xmath103 or @xmath6 , and contains no time derivatives of them .",
    "finally the second  order correlation approximation was used . in this approximation",
    "the velocity correlation tensor @xmath104 of the second rank , @xmath105 plays a central part .",
    "the calculations have partially been carried out in the fourier space , and the fourier  transformed correlation tensor @xmath106 has been used , defined such that @xmath107 the  original \" turbulence , which occurs in the limit of vanishing coriolis force and vanishing gradient of the mean motion , is assumed to deviate from a homogeneous isotropic and mirror  symmetric one only by a gradient of its intensity . the corresponding fourier ",
    "transformed correlation tensor @xmath106 was assumed to have the form @xmath108 with some function @xmath109 describing the kinetic energy distribution in the fourier space .",
    "it was chosen such that @xmath110 where @xmath111 describes the turbulence intensity in the limit of vanishing coriolis force and mean velocity gradient , and @xmath112 and @xmath113 are correlation length and time in this limit .",
    "the results for the coefficients @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 can be represented with the help of the prandtl number @xmath114 of the fluid , the magnetic reynolds number @xmath115 of the turbulent motion and a dimensionless parameter @xmath116 , @xmath117 where @xmath118 .",
    "clearly @xmath115 , like @xmath119 , in general depends on position .",
    "the quantity @xmath116 is the ratio of the magnetic diffusion time @xmath120 to the correlation time @xmath113 .",
    "we speak of low ",
    "conductivity limit if @xmath121 , and of high  conductivity limit if @xmath122 .",
    "as for the general results concerning @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 we refer to the mentioned paper , in particular relations ( 55)(58 ) and figures  1 and 2 .",
    "these results cover arbitrary @xmath114 and @xmath116 .",
    "we may write @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 except @xmath123 and @xmath61 in the form @xmath124 and @xmath125 the @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath64 , @xmath128 are dimensionless functions of @xmath114 and @xmath116",
    ". only @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 are independent of @xmath114 . in the case of @xmath129 and @xmath130 this independence appears as natural when considering the derivation of these results , in the case of @xmath131 it occurs as a accidental compensation of different influences .",
    "further we have @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "as will become clear in the following section here only results for specific @xmath114 and @xmath116 are of interest .",
    "table  1 gives some values of the @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath64 , @xmath128 for such @xmath114 and @xmath116 .",
    "let us make a few estimates of the turbulence effects to be expected in the perm dynamo device on the basis of the general form ( [ eq27 ] ) of the mean electromotive force @xmath11 , the relations ( [ eq267 ] ) and ( [ eq269 ] ) , and numerical values represented in table  1 . as for the properties of the liquid sodium we put @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "as a typical value @xmath136 of the mean velocity @xmath7 we use @xmath137 .",
