    "nuclei with the equal numbers of neutrons and protons ( @xmath0 ) have become a special ground to investigate neutron - proton ( _ np _ ) correlations . in @xmath0 nuclei ,",
    "neutrons and protons occupy the same shell - model orbits , leading to large spatial overlaps between neutron and proton wave functions .",
    "the _ np _ pairing is further enhanced in odd - odd @xmath0 nuclei due to odd neutron and odd proton correlation .",
    "the _ np _ residual pairing interaction can be equally important as the neutron - neutron ( _ nn _ , @xmath6 ) and proton - proton ( _ pp _ , @xmath7 ) pairings .",
    "while _ nn _ and _ pp _ pairings have been well established in terms of the simple bcs model , the _ np _ pairing is still an open question that has motivated many recent theoretical and experimental works @xcite .",
    "in contrast to _ pp _ and _ nn _ correlations , the _ np _ pairing can form isovector ( @xmath8 ) and isoscalar ( @xmath9 ) configurations .",

    "moreover , the high - precision measurements of level schemes provide useful information for discussion of the isospin asymmetry in their excited states at different angular momenta @xcite .",
    "experimentally , isospin effects can be discussed by defining the mirror energy differences ( med ) and triplet energy differences ( ted ) between analogous states in mirror pairs and @xmath2 triplets , respectively @xcite .",
    "the differences have their origins from the coulomb interaction and charge dependence in strong force , while the former usually plays a dominant role . in the _ fp _ shell , the coulomb shifts of single - particle orbits are relatively small @xcite .",
    "this allows us to extract the effect from the charge symmetry breaking in the strong force for the many - body systems of nuclei .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the structures and properties of odd - odd @xmath0 nuclei in the _ fp _ model space by the shell - model diagonalization method .",
    "the many - body interaction used in the effective hamiltonian has been derived from a high - precision charge - dependent bonn ( cd - bonn ) nucleon - nucleon ( _ nn _ ) potential @xcite using the so - called folded - diagram method @xcite .",
    "the obtained interaction retains the charge - independence breaking effects in the _ nn _ potential . the contribution from the coulomb field is also included .",

    "ii , we describe briefly the folded - diagram method and the construction of the residual interaction . in section iii , the level structures of the odd - odd @xmath0 nuclei in the @xmath10 shell are calculated and discussed . in section iv , we discuss the electromagnetic properties of the odd - odd @xmath0 nuclei with analyzing the isospin structures of the nuclei .",
    "we start from the mean - field approximation with the perturbation expansion . in this approximation , it is convenient to reduce the degree of freedom of the hilbert space for the many - fermion system of nuclei . for large - scale shell - model diagonalizations ,",
    "the determination of the model space is a crucial step .",

    "the central spirit of shell model calculations is to find a unified interaction for a given mass region .",
    "for the _ fp _ nuclei , various interactions have been proposed , such as the kuo - brown ( kb ) renormalized g matrix @xcite and its modified versions with monopole centroid corrections @xcite , the fpd6 analytic two - body potential @xcite and the gxpf interaction @xcite .",
    "these interactions have been extensively tested with the successful descriptions of rotational collectivities of nuclei in the upper part of the @xmath3 shell ( e.g. , @xmath31cr ) @xcite .",
    "however , these interactions conserve isospin symmetry . in this work",
    ", we present a new isospin - nonconserving effective interaction derived microscopically from the underlying @xmath32 potential .",
    "traditionally , effective residual interaction is derived from phenomenal fit to observations @xcite ( e.g. , the usd interaction for the @xmath30 shell . ) or from the evaluation of the g reaction matrix @xcite .",
    "although the effective interaction can in principle be derived from true @xmath32 interaction , it has to be renormalized to include the contributions from the excluded configurations and to avoid the hard core of the bare @xmath32 potential .",

    "the @xmath179 values of ground - state fermi ( @xmath180 ) decays would be the same for analogous transitions if the conserved vector current ( cvc ) hypothesis is valid @xcite .",
    "odd - odd @xmath0 nuclei provide the best ground to test the understanding of the electroweak interaction . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the isospin - symmetry breaking effect has significant contribution on the asymmetry in analogous transitions . in our hamiltonian ,",
    "the isospin symmetry breaking is treated microscopically , which can provide a basis to quantify the effect .",
    "however , it is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "a microscopical _ fp_-shell interaction has been constructed from the high - precision cd bonn _",
    "nn _ potential using the folded - diagram renormalization method . in the cd bonn potential ,",
    "both charge symmetry breaking and charge independence breaking are well described . the coulomb field is also included in calculating the effective interaction .",
    "hence , in our effective hamiltonian , isospin symmetry is naturally broken .",
    "the isospin - nonconserving interaction has been used to investigate the level structures of odd - odd self - conjugate nuclei in the lower part of _ fp _ shell .",
    "excellent agreements between calculations and experiments have been obtained .",
    "particularly , the interaction gave a good description of the isospin structures in odd - odd @xmath0 nuclei , reproducing well the relative positions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands .",
    "further studies done with the idaho - a chiral perturbation potential showed similar results .",
    "moreover , calculations show that effective interactions derived with the folded - diagram method can reproduce the low - lying structures of odd - odd @xmath0 nuclei in other major shells , including the famous case of @xmath82b in _ p _ shell .",
    "our calculations reproduce the high - spin isomeric states in the _ fp _ shell .",
    "in particular , we have performed detailed shell - model calculations for the positive - parity states in @xmath4v and @xmath5mn .",
    "em transition properties and isospin structures in odd - odd @xmath0 nuclei have been predicted and discussed .",
    "we can construct a one - to - one correspondence between calculated results and experimental data with the comparisons of excitation energies and electromagnetic transition properties .",
    "our study shows that the predictions of this _ ab initio _ interaction is encouraging .",
    "it is very interesting to test its performance in other _",
    "_ shell nuclei .",
    "further studies will be carried out in our future works .",
