    "it is convenient for theoreticians as well as experimentalists to maintain the fiction that bacteria exist as planktonic cells in well - mixed liquid cultures , all with equal access to nutrients , wastes , toxins , antibiotics , bacterial viruses , and each other .",
    "however , in the real world , bacteria are more often found in physically structured , spatially heterogeneous habitats as colonies and micro - colonies . while one can experimentally explore the population and evolutionary dynamics of bacteria in such physically structured habitats",
    ", there is dearth of mathematical models to generate hypotheses for and to interpret results of these experiments . as a step towards the construction of a theory of the population dynamics of bacteria in physical structured habitats , we develop and",
    "experientially explore the simplest such model of the dynamics of bacterial growth in 3-d structured colonies .",
    "in 1942 , jacques monod developed a mathematical model of bacterial growth in a liquid culture , where the bacterial cells and nutrient molecules were homogeneously distributed @xcite .",
    "a simple ordinary differential equation was accurate enough to account for the exponential growth of bacteria and their ascent into stationary phase following the exhaustion of the limiting resource .",
    "the model has proven to be long - lived since most experimental studies of the population dynamics of bacteria are in liquid culture@xcite .",
    "in contrast , outside the tubes , flasks , and chemostats of laboratory culture , bacteria most commonly live as physically structured habitats as colonies or microcolonies .",
    "such colonies are heterogeneous ; at a minimum , their cells vary in their access to nutrients depending on their position within the colony and thereby divide at different rates .",
    "the majority of research directed at understanding structured bacterial population growth has been confined to two dimensional ( 2-d ) surfaces @xcite , including studying the interplay of evolution and the physical structure @xcite , or analyzing effects of mechanical interactions in an expanding colony @xcite .",
    "however , diffusion in two dimensions is different from three , making it easier to form diffusion - limited instabilities @xcite . in 3-d",
    ", work has been done to understand nutrient shielding of the interior of a colony by the microbes on the surface , treating them as individual agents @xcite .",
    "however , we are not aware of 3-d models of colony growth that account for the spatially varying density of nutrients and bacteria , explain the observed experimental phenomenology of bacterial growth in such colonies , and do so in a relatively simple coarse - grained ( pde ) monod - style manner , rather than relying on complex agent simulations of individual bacteria    here we develop such a model that treats the growth rate heterogeneity due to the non - uniform nutrient distribution produced self - consistently by consumption of a nutrient by the bacteria .",
    "we explore its fit experimentally with the growth of _",
    "e.  coli _ maintained and growing as colonies embedded in 3-d matrix of soft agar with an initially uniform spatial distribution of a limiting carbon source , glucose ( fig .",
    "[ image ] ) .",
    "we compare dynamics of growth of bacteria in colonies with that of planktonic cells in liquid culture with the same concentration of limiting glucose . in our model , we assume that the colony is essentially unconstrained by the soft agar and is free to expand , and the bacteria within them are non - motile .",
    "this combined theoretical - experimental study reveals two surprising features of bacterial populations growing as colonies : ( i ) the bacteria within these structures exist as loosely packed viable cells , and ( ii ) the viable cell densities of bacteria produced in colonies is more than two - fold greater than that in liquid cultures with the same concentration of the limiting glucose .",
    "we use population growth of _ e.  coli _ in minimal medium as the basis for developing the model . to control the amount of nutrients available to the bacteria , we use glucose at the initial concentration @xmath0 mg / ml , at which it limits the stationary phase density of _",
    "e.  coli _ produced as planktonic cells and as colonies in soft agar .",
    "we grow bacteria either in liquid cultures or as three - dimensional colonies embedded in soft agar ( fig .",
    "[ image ] ) . unless otherwise noted , 3-d colonies",
    "are grown in @xmath1 ml of soft agar , inoculated with approximately @xmath2 bacteria / ml . under these conditions , each colony has an access to a nutrient subvolume of @xmath3 ml , or , on average , a nutrient sphere of radius @xmath4 mm . for the liquid and the 3-d growth",
    ", we estimate the density of viable cells , @xmath5 , at different times diluting and plating and then counting the number of resulting colonies ( colony - forming units , or cfu ) , see _ methods _ for details . for each time point , we obtain 6 independent replicates of cfu density estimates , and each experiment was replicated at least 3 times .",
    "the results of these population growth experiments are shown in fig .",
    "[ datacompiled ] ( data points ) . in liquid , the density of the population increases exponentially , and then abruptly stops and begins to decline at a low rate , presumably because the bacteria consume the available glucose and enter the stationary phase , at which time the rate of cell mortality exceeds that of division .",
    "in contrast , in 3-d colonies , the exponential growth and the stationary phase are separated by a gradual decline in the net rate of growth .",
    "we expect that this is because the growth of the population here is limited by the speed with which diffusion brings glucose from the periphery of the available nutrient volume to the colony , where it is consumed by the bacteria .",
    "surprisingly , the maximum density of bacteria growing as colonies is substantially greater than that in liquid , despite the concentration of the limiting glucose being equal for liquid and the soft agar . to understand these findings quantitatively",
    ", we now develop a simple ( minimalist ) mathematical model of resource - limited bacterial growth in liquid and as spatially structured colonies .",
    "our liquid culture model of bacterial growth is a variant of that of monod @xcite . in this model ,",
    "all bacteria have the same resource ( glucose ) concentration dependent growth rate @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the concentration of glucose , @xmath8 is the maximum growth rate , and @xmath9 , the monod constant , is the concentration of the resource when the growth rate is half its maximum value @xmath10 . with these parameters ,",
    "the rate of change of the density of the bacterial population @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the volume of the liquid where the culture grows , and @xmath14 is the liquid _ yield _ , which measures the number of bacteria produced by a microgram of the nutrient .",

    "specifically , we added a small constant death rate @xmath18 to account for the decrease of the population in the liquid culture after the saturation ( fig .",
    "[ datacompiled ] ) .",
    "thus the population has a zero net growth at a critical nutrient density of @xmath19 , which represents the minimum nutrient concentration needed to sustain life without growth @xcite .    ]    .",
    "liquid cultures switch abruptly from the exponential growth to the saturation , and then decay slowly .",
    "in contrast , 3-d colonies gradually slow down before saturating ( see inset ) at a population size larger than that in the liquid , and then decay .",
    "[ datacompiled ] ]    we fit the five growth parameters ( @xmath20 , @xmath9 , @xmath14 , @xmath21 , and @xmath18 ) to the experimental data using nonlinear least squares fitting , and estimate uncertainties of the fit using bootstrapping ( see _ materials and methods _ , and also table  [ fittedpars ] ) . as seen in fig .",
    "[ datacompiled ] ( blue curve ) , after the lag phase , the population increases exponentially before it saturates abruptly when all the cells in the colony run out of food at the same time .",
    "the excellent agreement between the experiments and the model is encouraging .",
    "it allows us to use the monod model with death as the basis for 3-d studies .    to develop the minimal model of 3-d growth ,",
    "we assume that the bacteria within the colony are physiologically identical , but depending on their position , vary in their access to the diffusing carbon source .",
    "thus all cells grow according to the monod model , differing only by the local availability of the limiting nutrient , glucose , @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that soft agar is too soft to provide mechanical resistance to the colony , but sufficiently dense to keep cells from moving .",
    "as the cells divide , the colony expands symmetrically as a sphere , keeping a constant cell density per volume of the space occupied by the colony .",
    "this leads to the following equations for the spherically - symmetric local number density of cells @xmath23 and nutrient concentration @xmath24 : @xmath25\\label{qg4},\\\\    \\frac{\\partial \\rho(r , t)}{\\partial t}&=d\\nabla^2\\rho    -\\frac{1}{a_{\\rm c}}n(r , t)\\,\\theta(t-{\\tau_{\\rm lag}})\\frac{{g_{\\rm",

    "two different growth regimes are clearly visible after the lag but before the ultimate saturation and the slow cell death .",

    "this regime is indistinguishable from the growth in liquid .",
    "when the local nutrients are depleted at a certain time @xmath37 following the start of the growth at @xmath21 , new nutrients must be brought from afar by diffusion .",
    "this is slow , resulting in a slower _ diffusion - limited growth _ regime .",
    "here the overall colony growth rate is an average over cells growing at different rates due to different concentrations of the locally accessible nutrient .",

    "when local resources are exhausted , growth is limited by nutrients diffusing in from the volume @xmath49 . however , because the encounter probability for a 3-d random walk is less than one @xcite , most of the nutrient molecules coming from afar will not be immediately absorbed .",
    "in fact , since the box - counting dimension of a diffusive process is two , only @xmath50 nutrient molecules will be captured in time @xmath51 , resulting in @xmath52 .",

    "in contrast , our three - dimensional result depends critically on knowing how the radius of the colony scales with the number of growing bacteria .",
    "in particular , here we can not model the colony as a point - like object .",
    "thus the exponent of the power law scaling is not universal in 3-d , and it may change for heterogeneous colonies with varying cell size and cell density .      to determine the extent to which our minimal model accounts for the dynamics of growth of bacteria in colonies , we fit the model to data using nonlinear least squares fitting , similar to the liquid case .",
