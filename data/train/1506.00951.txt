    "according to the @xmath7cdm cosmological model , massive galaxies build up in part through the amalgamation and merger of smaller galaxies .",
    "the globular cluster ( gc ) systems of such massive galaxies , which are often quite rich , are also thought to be assembled , at least partially , from gcs donated by the smaller accreted galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if this is indeed the case , gcs can act as valuable tracers of such events , while offering the potential to understand the formation history of their host galaxy . in their influential study , @xcite uncovered important clues about the formation of the milky way through its gc system , namely that accretion played a significant part in the process .",

    "indeed the growth of our galaxy and its gc system is still ongoing .",
    "observations of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy , which is currently being accreted onto the milky way while donating at least 5 gcs to the galactic halo , provide the strongest evidence that this is the case ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the work of our group has shown that a similar situation is also observed in m31 .",

    "the study of dwarf irregular galaxies ( dirr ) is a particularly important topic within the context of understanding galaxy formation .",
    "being by far the most common galaxy type at high redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , dirr systems could have provided a significant contribution toward the growth of massive galaxies at early times .",
    "in addition , in order to use gc as probes of galaxy assembly , it is crucial to understand the properties of gc systems in dwarf galaxies , and how they relate to the host galaxy properties and to the properties of gcs formed _ in situ _ around a massive galaxy . in this context ,",
    "dirr galaxies are especially helpful , since in the local universe they are often found either in isolation or in groups without a massive dominating companion , making them excellent systems for studying the pristine properties of gc systems .",
    "lying in the southern hemisphere with galactocentric coordinates of @xmath8 , ngc  6822 is one of the most intriguing dwarf galaxies in the local group .",
    "discovered by @xcite , this barred dirr galaxy features a number of peculiar properties that has made it the focus of much attention over the years , even though its low galactic latitude makes observations quite challenging .",
    "it has an absolute magnitude @xmath9 and a half - light radius of @xmath10  kpc @xcite . located at a distance of @xmath11  kpc @xcite , it is the closest dirr galaxy save for the magellanic clouds .",
    "it does not appear to be associated with either the milky way or m31 , and it has no other neighbouring companions .",
    "this galaxy contains a substantial spheroidal component , that has been traced via its constituent red giant branch stars out to a radius of at least @xmath12  kpc @xcite .",
    "@xcite used carbon stars in the spheroid as kinematic tracers , finding evidence for rotational support .",
    "in addition , ngc  6822 contains large quantities of hi gas forming a disc , the semi - major axis of which is positioned perpendicular to the stellar spheroid ( e.g * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the hi gas is also observed to be rotating , but at right angles to the rotation of the spheroid , showing that there are at least two different kinematic components present in ngc  6822 .",
    "this is further supported by a recent study on planetary nebulae and hii regions by @xcite , showing that the planetary nebulae have kinematics similar to the carbon stars , while the hii regions share the kinematics of the hi disc .    in recent years , dedicated searches",
    "have substantially increased the number of gcs known around local group galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including ngc  6822 .",
    "hubble  vii , originally discovered by @xcite , was long considered the only old gc in ngc  6822 .",
    "however , this changed when @xcite discovered 4 new gcs in wide - field _ cfht / megacam _ imagery covering an area of @xmath13  deg around ngc  6822 , .",
    "later , @xcite re - examined this data and by complementing it with additional archival _ subaru _ and _ cfht _ imagery which expanded the observed footprint , uncovered 3 additional gcs , bringing the total number of members to 8 .",
    "figure  [ fig : spatialn6822 ] shows the positions of the gcs superimposed on an image of ngc  6822 , on which are also marked the contours of the hi distribution , ranging between 3.5 - 42 @xmath14  @xmath15 @xcite , and the known extent of the red giant branch stars in the galaxy spheroid @xcite .",
    "it is notable that the gc system of ngc  6822 is quite spatially extended , with the most remote cluster , sc1 , having a projected radius of nearly 11  kpc .",
    "furthermore , the gcs are arranged in a rather linear configuration , with an orientation aligned quite closely with the major axis of the spheroid @xcite .",
    "five of the 8 gcs in ngc  6822 are fairly extended in nature and thus resemble the extended clusters found in the haloes of m31 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and m33 @xcite .",
    "the coordinates , position angles , projected radii ( @xmath16 ) , gc type and galactic @xmath17 extinction values @xcite of the clusters are listed in table  [ tab : n6822coords ] .    ) and corrected for the systemic motion of ngc  6822 .",
    "the ellipse shows the extent of the stellar spheroid traced by @xcite , with a semi major axis of 36  arcmin and an ellipticity of 0.36 .",

    "the uncertainties of the pressure - supported mass component are calculated via the jackknifing technique , while the uncertainties in the rotation component are only due to the error propagation of the detected amplitude in the relevant scenarios .",
    "total massess estimated assuming the rotating disk and the non - rotating scenario yield similar results , which is unsurprising given the low degree of rotation detected in the disk model .",
    "for these cases our measurements yield an estimated mass of @xmath18 , with a corresponding mass - to - light ratio of @xmath19 .",
    "these estimates are , however , smaller than those from @xcite who found the mass of ngc  6822 within 11  kpc to be @xmath20  using four extended clusters only ( sc1-sc4 ) .",
    "the discrepancy in the estimates is likely due to the large uncertainties in the velocity measurements , in combination with their smaller cluster sample .",
    "still , our inferred mass - to - light ratio makes ngc  6822 a highly dark matter dominated system when compared to other dwarf galaxies of similar luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    on the other hand , assuming the rotating cigar scenario we estimate the mass of ngc  6822 to be unreasonably high , about @xmath21 , as indicated by the associated mass - to - light ratio .",
    "this adds further confidence that the high rotation signal found for this model is indeed a spurious detection .",
    "it is worth acknowledging the caveats regarding the choice of @xmath22 and @xmath23 parameters which feature in the tme .",
    "it is unclear whether their assumed values are indeed the right choices when estimating the mass of ngc  6822 , thus adding additional uncertainty which is not formally included . using the same method and identical assumptions , but only 4 extended gcs",
    ", @xcite found the total mass of ngc  6822 enclosed within 11 kpc to be @xmath24  .",
    "this most likely indicates that when dealing with a small samples such as this one , the inclusion or exclusion of a single data point can have an important effect on the results . for reference , using the kinematics of the hi gas",
    ", @xcite found a mass of @xmath25   within @xmath12  kpc from the centre of ngc  6822 .",
    "gcs hosted by dwarf galaxies have been often found to have similar colours as gcs residing in the haloes of massive galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and our results are in keeping with that . comparing the optical colours of the gcs hosted by ngc  6822 with those located in the m31 outer halo , it is found that they are all mutually consistent , having @xmath26 .",
    "this is also true for the gcs residing in the dwarf elliptical galaxies ngc  147 and ngc  185 , located in the outer halo of m31 @xcite . in terms of their number , extended gcs dominate the population of ngc  6822 and there is a similarity between the mean absolute magnitudes of the extended gcs hosted by ngc  6822 and by m31 , which are found to be @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "this may either be a fundamental property of extended gcs in general , or is a result of a bias arising from the faint limit of the survey imaging from which these objects were discovered . given that some of them lie right at the detection limit , it is possible that the extended gcs have a larger range of absolute magnitudes than observed at present , but the currently available data allows only for the bright end of the luminosity function to be observed , resulting in the low spread and similar @xmath29 values .",
    "nonetheless , the range of luminosities , structures , ages and metallicities spanned by the gcs in ngc6822 is broadly consistent with that observed in the m31 halo population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a number of studies have focused on gc systems hosted by dirr galaxies outside the local group ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they have found that gcs have typical optical colours within the range of @xmath30 , consistent with our measurements . in their study , @xcite searched for gcs in 19 nearby ( 2 - 8 mpc ) dirr galaxies using archival _ hst",
    "the galaxies in their sample are members of dwarf galaxy associations only , without a dominant massive galaxy nearby . in the final sample of gc candidates that passed all their selection criteria ,",
    "@xcite found an absence of objects having @xmath31 and @xmath32 , i.e. faint and blue gcs .",
    "the authors claim that this effect is not due to a bias in their gc selection criteria , nor a bias due to the depth of the imaging , since they are able to identify clusters down to @xmath33 . in ngc  6822",
    "however , there are 2 extended gcs which satisfy these criteria .",
    "if such clusters were present in the sample of @xcite , they were most likely missed because of their low surface brightness as well as their extended morphology .",
    "we have considered three scenarios for the kinematic configuration of the gc system of ngc  6822 .",
    "as indicated in the previous section , the so - called `` disk '' and `` no - rotation '' models are the most plausible of these . in the disk scenario",
    "our analysis provides tentative evidence for a weak rotation signal of amplitude @xmath34 , although clearly the case of zero rotation is not strongly excluded .",
    "it is interesting to note that this putative rotation would be in the same sense as that detected for stars in the underlying stellar spheroid by @xcite , and also of a comparable magnitude ( although we note that the demers et al .",
    "measurements do not extend to particularly large galactocentric radii ) .",
    "similarly , the velocity dispersion we infer for the gc system matches closely that determined from the @xcite kinematic sample , once the global rotation has been accounted for ( see * ? ? ?",
    "these similarities suggest that the gc system of ngc  6822 is plausibly associated with its stellar spheroid , and indeed this would be consistent with the clear linear alignment of the gcs with the major axis of the spheroid .",
    "our third kinematic model  the so - called `` cigar '' model  would imply a large systemic rotation amongst the gc population , although this is strongly sensitive to the precise orientation of the rotation axis . in this case",
    ", the sense of rotation would be opposite to that seen for the hi gas by @xcite ; furthermore , the inferred amplitude would be considerably larger than that seen for the hi gas at comparable distances along its major axis to those of the gcs . in the event this model was correct",
    ", it would appear that the gcs are not asscociated with the hi gas component of ngc  6822 .",
    "the gcs could constitute a dynamically young system , in which case a search for a stellar stream along the major axis of the ngc  6822 spheroid may prove fruitful .",
    "in this paper we present a uniform optical and near - ir photometric study of the gc system hosted by ngc  6822 .",
    "the photometric measurements are used to estimate the ages and metallicities of the gcs via a colour - colour plot and an empirical colour - metallicity relation .",
    "all gcs are found to have ages consistent with 9  gyrs or older , in agreement with past studies . on the other hand ,",
    "the clusters are found to exhibit a range of metallicities ( @xmath35 \\lesssim -0.4}$ ] ) , at odds with previous spectroscopic studies which found them to be very metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath36 ) .",
    "metallicity measurements from resolved colour - magnitude diagrams would alleviate this tension , as would higher s / n spectroscopy .",
    "we also modelled the kinematics of the gc system using new velocities for six members , two of which had no previous spectroscopic information . with the caveat at our results",
    "are based on a small sample , we found tentative evidence for a weak rotation signal of amplitude @xmath37  in the case where the rotation axis sits perpendicular to the linear arrangement of the gcs on the sky .",
    "however , zero rotation is not strongly excluded by our analysis . if the rotation is real , then it would be in the same sense as inferred for the underlying stellar spheroid by @xcite , and of a comparable amplitude .",
    "furthermore , the velocity dispersion we determine for the gc system , @xmath38  is very similar to that exhibited by stars in the spheroid ( see * ? ? ?",
    "these similarities suggest to us that the gcs are plausibly associated with the spheroidal component of ngc  6822 .",
    "finally , using the gcs as dynamical mass tracers , the total mass of ngc  6822 is recalculated to be roughly @xmath39 , subject to various systematic effects due the small data sample and the implicit assumptions built into the tme .",
    "the corresponding mass - to - light ratio sits in the range @xmath6 , implying that ngc  6822 hosts a substantial dark matter component .",
