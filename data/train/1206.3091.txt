    "topological insulators ( tis ) are bulk insulators possessing helical surface states that span the bulk band gap as a consequence of strong spin - orbit coupling @xcite . while bi@xmath0se@xmath1 shares these properties with a set of bi and sb chalcogenides , it is unique among the 3d topological insulators as it has a comparatively large band gap of 0.35 ev and a simple surface spectrum consisting of a single dirac cone roughly centered within the gap @xcite .",
    "these features have made it a system of choice for ti experiments @xcite .    to date , many of the most informative experiments",
    "have been performed using surface sensitive probes , such as angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) or scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite .",
    "potential applications of ti compounds will require the development of transport measurements , which so far have been hindered by bulk conduction in these materials , which masks the transport properties of the surface states @xcite . in bi@xmath0se@xmath1",
    ", se - vacancies typically result in n - type doping that pins the fermi level in the bulk conduction band @xcite .",
    "several approaches are being explored to tune the fermi level into the gap . in particular , nanoscale samples offer an increased surface - to - volume ratio and have allowed the employment of high - k dielectrics or electrolytic solutions for field effect gating @xcite . however , very high electric fields can induce dielectric breakdown , band bending , and in the case of polymeric gating , undesired chemical reactions at the surface of the crystal @xcite .",
    "therefore it is ideal to eliminate se - vacancies to the greatest extent possible .",
    "while nanoscale samples may be exfoliated from very high purity macroscopic crystals , there is typically some degradation relative to the bulk host material @xcite .",
    "together , these factors encourage the development of direct syntheses of nanoscale bi@xmath0se@xmath1 with minimal defects .    in numerous other materials ,",
    "the vapour - liquid - solid ( vls ) growth mechanism has afforded the possibility of epitaxial growth of high quality structures with predefined geometries @xcite .",

    "an inert gas flows over a heated bi@xmath0se@xmath1 powder , carrying bi and se vapours to a cooler growth substrate downstream .",
    "liquid au particles on the substrate saturate with the vapour and precipitate solid nanowires and nanoribbons .",
    "au particles remaining at the tips of the ribbons are evidence for the vls growth process . in such a configuration , however , it is difficult to control the magnitude and time dependence of the bi and se vapour concentration @xcite . despite recent work utilizing nanoribbons for ti transport experiments ,",
    "there has been comparatively little work studying the growth process itself @xcite . in conventional semiconductors , such as si",
    ", the vls growth process has been studied in - situ using chemical vapour deposition ( cvd ) in concert with high resolution tem imaging @xcite .",
    "given the degree of control of the doping level that is required for successful ti transport measurements , this class of compounds would benefit from detailed studies of the growth mechanism .",
    "in this work we employ a metalorganic chemical vapour deposition ( mocvd ) growth process in which bi@xmath0se@xmath1 nanostructures are grown in a controlled environment with well - defined , independently adjustable bi and se vapour concentrations .",
    "in our study we first obtain nanostructure growth at a specific set of growth parameters and then vary the parameters in order to understand the process of nanoribbon formation .",
    "the ratio of bi to se vapour is of particular importance in the interest of reducing se vacancies and is the focus of our study .",
    "we perform growth in a mocvd system depicted schematically in figure 1 .",
    "the reactor is based on a design that has yielded high quality growth of inp and inas nanowires @xcite .",
    "the growth chamber consists of a 12 inch spherical chamber that has a base pressure @xmath4 torr .",
    "samples are loaded into the chamber via a sample load lock that is evacuated to @xmath5 torr .",
    "the substrate rests on a 2 inch boron nitride heater stage at the chamber center and the temperature is monitored using a standard thermocouple .",
    "mass flow controllers ( mfcs ) admit prescribed flow rates of hydrogen through bubblers containing the liquid metalorganic precursors diethyl selenium ( dese ) and trimethyl bismuth ( tmbi ) .",
    "the metalorganic vapours enter a cold - wall growth chamber where they decompose at the heated substrate .",
    "dese and tmbi are commercially available in high purities , have cracking temperatures of @xmath6 450 @xmath7c , and are unlikely to react in the gas phase @xcite . among possible se precursors , dese has several advantages , including atmospheric stability and low toxicity .",
    "schematic illustration of the growth process .",
    "hydrogen carrier gas passes through bubblers and delivers a dilute vapour of trimethyl bismuth and diethyl selenium to the heated substrate ( _ left _ ) . at the substrate",
    "the precursors decompose , forming long crystallites of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ( _ right _ ) .",

    "an excess of se flux is necessary to compensate for the se evaporating from the crystal during growth @xcite .",
    "precursor vapour pressures and constraints on h@xmath0 flows prevent us from exceeding @xmath10 = 45 while maintaining fixed tmbi pressure .",
    "prior studies of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 mocvd thin film deposition using dese and tmbi serve as a guide for the above growth conditions , although differences are expected for nanoribbon growth @xcite .",
    "these studies report the onset of mass - flow limited deposition above about 465 @xmath7c , although at a significantly higher flow rate than we use here . in the present study ,",
    "the growth substrate temperature is typically maintained at 470 @xmath7c to ensure complete decomposition of the precursors .",
    "in addition , thin film studies observed se deficient films for ratios below about 20 , which led us to typically use a ratio near 30 .",
    "bi@xmath0se@xmath1 nanostructures are grown on ( 100 ) orientation si substrates that are prepared with a 5 nm thick thermally evaporated au film . at elevated temperatures",
    "the film forms a dense layer of au nanoparticles 1040 nm in diameter ( see figure 8) .",
    "several other substrates including sio@xmath0 , si ( 111 ) , and gaas were also tested , but produced no ribbon growth . in an alternative preparation ,",

    "mocvd allows for precise control of the entire growth process .",
    "once an overall h@xmath0 carrier gas flow is initiated ( 600 sccm ) , active pressure control stabilizes the growth pressure to 100 torr .",
    "the sample is heated to the growth temperature ( 460500 @xmath7c ) in 30 seconds .",
    "precursor flow is initiated when the sample heater stabilizes to within 0.1 @xmath7c of the prescribed growth temperature .",
    "precursor flows are maintained for @xmath12 = 730 minutes for sample growth .",
    "flow of the bi precursor is halted to terminate growth .",
    "the sample heater is then turned off and the sample cools to 150 @xmath7c in @xmath6200 seconds .",
    "se evaporation from the nanoribbons is minimized by maintaining the flow of dese until the sample has cooled to a temperature less than 150 @xmath7c .    in the present study",

    "ribbons consistently grow ` on - edge ' ( i.e. normal to the substrate and along the basal plane of the bi@xmath0se@xmath1 crystal ) suggesting that nucleation depends on lattice - matching between bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and substrate .",

    "a sudden onset of ribbon growth is observed at 470 @xmath7c , consistent with a thermally activated decomposition process and previous reports in the literature indicating that the precursors fully decompose near this temperature @xcite .",
