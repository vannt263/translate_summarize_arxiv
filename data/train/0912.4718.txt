    "the wigner function is the quantum equivalent of the classical particle distribution function and can be used to calculate average values of physical observables @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "the time evolution of the wigner function is evaluated considering only scalar potentials , hence without the inclusion of magnetic fields .",
    "one reason for this is the considerable analytic complexity of the electromagnetic wigner equation .",
    "indeed even the electrostatic wigner equation already is a cumbersome integro - differential equation which hardly can be examined except in the linear limit .",
    "however , the emergence of new areas like spintronics @xcite where magnetic effects are crucial makes it desirable to have quantum kinetic models allowing for nonzero vector potentials .",
    "in this situation the gauge invariance of the wigner function should be assured from the very beginning in order to avoid inconsistencies , a point somewhat neglected in previous studies .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to stress the relevance and properties of the gauge invariant wigner function ( giwf ) @xcite in connection with quantum plasmas problems .",
    "in addition we provide a macroscopic ( moments ) formulation starting from the electromagnetic wigner - maxwell system , substantially generalizing the recently introduced moments system derived from the wigner - poisson equations @xcite .",
    "the resulting macroscopic equations are a step toward the inclusion of spin dependent variables , postponed to future considerations .",
    "the advantages in macroscopic formulations are in their relative simplicity , so that the nonlinear regimes are not necessarily unaccessible apart from numerical simulations .",
    "notice however that our fluid approach does not imply any fluid approximations , in the sense that we are not supposing a large collision rate or a short mean free path for instance .",
    "if we are interested only in basic quantities like particle , current or energy densities , nothing forbids to compute moments of the wigner function in order to derive fluid - like equations for the time - evolution of these variables .",
    "the roots of the moments descriptions in plasma theory can be traced back to grad @xcite .",
    "the price of replacing the more detailed kinetic models by macroscopic models is the loss of information on kinetic phenomena like landau damping , the plasma echo and many others .",

    "these quantities are invariant under the local gauge transformation @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an arbitrary differentiable function .",
    "if the starting point is the usual ( gauge dependent ) wigner function @xmath19 which is written in terms of the canonical momentum @xmath20 , one obtains gauge independent results for the zeroth , first and second order moments , but gauge dependent quantities when considering higher order moments .",

    "hence apart from linear problems this wigner - maxwell system can be helpful only by means of numerical simulations , which are themselves not evident due to the complexity of the system .",
    "this motivate the creation of alternative models capturing the essentials of the quantum plasma dynamics .    in this context , recently @xcite a fluid moments hierarchy was derived from the electrostatic wigner equation . as usual in moments theories @xcite , a set of macroscopic variables ( particle density , current etc . )",
    "were defined in terms of integrals of the wigner function .",
    "the time - evolution of these quantities was then deduced from the wigner equation .",
    "no assumptions were made on the particular local equilibrium wigner function . in the linear limit , a quantum version of the bohm - gross dispersion relation was derived .",
    "also certain nonlinear traveling wave solutions were obtained .",
    "it is the central purpose of this work , to extend the results of ref .",
    "@xcite to the electromagnetic case .",

    "now the task is to obtain from the wigner equation the equations of motion for the several moments , which will compose an infinite coupled hierarchy .",
    "we also note that for the case of an isotropic distribution function , _",

    "( [ s ] ) .    from the above we can infer a general recipe for the closure of the fluid - like system up to the @xmath115moment : fourier transform the linearized evolution equations for the @xmath116 and @xmath117 moments , setting the @xmath118 moment to zero . in this way we derive an expression for the @xmath116 moment , so as to close the system for the @xmath119 moments .",
