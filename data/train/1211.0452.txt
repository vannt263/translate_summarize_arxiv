    "the sun shows an activity cycle with a period of eleven years , which is manifested by sunspots occurring on the solar disk . every eleven years",
    "the number of sunspots has a maximum and around five years later a minimum . with each cycle",
    "the polarity of the global magnetic field changes sign and gives rise to the 22 years _ hale _ cycle .",
    "the occurrence of sunspots does not only vary with time , but it also shows a strong latitudinal dependence . during solar minimum ,",
    "the sunspots are more likely to emerge at higher latitudes and during the maximum at lower latitudes , close to the equator .",
    "this observed feature corresponds to an equatorward migration of the magnetic activity belt causing the sunspots .",
    "producing the cyclic behavior in numerical simulations is challenging .",
    "either one neglects important backreaction of the magnetic field on the fluid motions and solves the problem in a kinematic mean - field approach with widely varying parameterizations for the small scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or one uses direct numerical simulations ( dns ) with orders of magnitudes too high viscosity and diffusivity , and too low stratification of density and temperature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the kinematic mean - field approach seems to be successful in reproducing observed features of the sun .",
    "however , whether solar activity is generated by a distributed turbulent dynamo throughout the convection zone or in a thin layer below the convection zone is still very much under debate and can not be answered just by mean - field modeling .",
    "it has turned out to be much more challenging to obtain solar - like magnetic activity from dns or large - eddy simulations : models either show only weak mean fields @xcite , strong quasi - steady large - scale fields @xcite , cycles but no migration @xcite , or cycles and poleward migration @xcite . recently @xcite were able to reproduce an equatorward migration of the azimuthal and radial magnetic fields for the first time using direct numerical simulation of a convective dynamo .",
    "another important observed feature of the sun is its differential rotation .",
    "it is broadly believed that the solar differential rotation is an important ingredient in the solar dynamo . in the kinematic models",
    "the differential rotation profile is used as an input parameter . beside mean - field models",
    "( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a solar - like differential rotation profile has not yet been self - consistently obtained in direct numerical simulations .",
    "often the rotation profile is solar - like in the sense that the equator rotates faster than the poles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the angular velocity is constant on cylinders due to the taylor - proudman balance . _ spoke - like _ rotation has not been seen unless a latitudinal temperature gradient is imposed at the base of the convection zone @xcite .    in the following work",
    ", we present the results of a two - layer model , which combines a convection zone with a coronal layer .",
    "the model was originally developed to investigate coronal ejections generated by a dynamo underneath the surface and the helicity flux due to the coronal envelope and the ejections , see @xcite and @xcite for details . in this work",
    "we focus on the magnetic and fluid properties in the convection zone .",
    "the dynamics of coronal ejections will be discussed in a followup paper .",

    "the inset in logarithmic scale emphasizes the steep decrease of the pressure and density in the coronal layer . ]",
    "we use a similar setup as in @xcite , which we improve in two respects .",
    "firstly , we apply more solar - like temperature and density profiles for the coronal layer . in the earlier work ,",
    "the temperature in the corona was constant and identical with that in the photosphere .",
    "now , we let the temperature rise above the surface reaching a constant value at a radius of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the solar radius . the coronal temperature is 1.2 times larger than that at the base of the convection zone . in figure  [ strat ]",
    "the radial profiles of density , temperature , pressure , and entropy are shown from the saturated stage of the simulation .",
    "the entropy is negative in the convection zone with a negative slope .",
    "close to the surface ( @xmath5 ) the gradient changes sign resulting in positive values above @xmath6 .",
    "the density decreases exponentially in the corona ( @xmath7 ) . in the convection zone ( @xmath8 )",
    "the stratification is initially isentropic .",
    "this results in a density difference @xmath9 in the convection zone and @xmath10 in the entire domain , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the other improvement is to use a turbulent heat conductivity @xmath14 in the entropy equation ( [ entr ] ) to model the unresolved heat conductivity .",
    "similar subgrid - scale models have also been used by e.g.@xcite and @xcite to significantly increase energy transport due to the convective flux .",
    "we apply a constant value of @xmath14 , which is similar to the molecular viscosity @xmath15 , in the interval of @xmath16 , and tends smoothly to zero above and below .",
    "we use a spherical wedge extending from @xmath17 to @xmath18 in radial direction , from @xmath19 to @xmath20 in colatitude , and from @xmath21 to @xmath22 in azimuthal direction .",
    "we solve the following equations of compressible magnetohydrodynamics : @xmath23 where magnetic field is expressed by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the vector potential , and @xmath26 is the magnetic diffusivity .",
    "furthermore , @xmath27 is the velocity , @xmath28 is the density and @xmath29 is the gravitational acceleration . the coriolis and lorentz forces are given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , where @xmath32 is the angular velocity and @xmath33 is the current density .",
    "@xmath34 is the traceless rate - of - strain tensor and @xmath15 is the kinematic viscosity . the energy conservation equation is solved in terms of the specific entropy @xmath35 .",
    "we include radiative transport in term of the diffusion approximation with heat conductivity @xmath36 and model the unresolved turbulent transport with @xmath14 .",
    "the fluid obeys the ideal gas law , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the ratio of specific heats at constant pressure and constant volume , respectively , and @xmath39 is the internal energy density , which defines the temperature @xmath40 .",
    "the third and fourth terms on the rhs of equation  ( [ entr ] ) describe viscous and ohmic heating .",
    "the radial cooling function @xmath41 is defined such that it cools / heats the corona towards a predefined temperature profile @xmath42 , which is plotted in figure  [ strat ] . as an initial condition we use a stratification profile similar to that plotted in figure  [ strat ] and a weak , random , gaussian - distributed seed magnetic field in the convection zone .",
    "we apply periodic boundary conditions in the azimuthal direction . for the velocity field we use stress - free conditions on all other boundaries . for the magnetic field",
    "we use a perfect conductor boundary condition at the @xmath17 and both @xmath43 boundaries ; at the @xmath18 boundary be apply a vertical - field condition .",
    "the heat flux through the lower ( @xmath17 ) boundary is held constant and the temperature at the top is fixed .",
    "we employ the pencil code , which uses sixth - order centered finite differences in space and a third - order runge - kutta scheme in time ; see @xcite for the extension to spherical coordinates .",
    "for this work we consider a single simulation , which is defined by the following properties : the coriolis number @xmath44 is 14 , the reynolds number @xmath45 is @xmath46 , and the magnetic prandtl number @xmath47 . here",

    "we plot the azimuthally averaged ( in the following mean ) radial and azimuthal magnetic fields as functions of time in terms of the turnover time @xmath59 .",
    "effectively @xmath60 is an eddy turnover time , which varies between a few minutes and more than a month in the solar convection zone , depending on the depth . in the kinematic regime ,",
    "the magnetic field pattern shows a cyclic poleward migration close to the surface ( @xmath53 ) for the azimuthal @xmath61 and radial fields @xmath52 at lower latitudes .",
    "the period is short , only a few tens @xmath62 . in the non - linear regime ,",
    "a new pattern is developing : equatorward migration starting at high latitudes overcomes the poleward migration at low latitudes .",
    "this equatorward migration shows a longer period of 100 - 200 @xmath62 .",
    "additionally the pattern is not only visible near the surface , as it penetrates into the convection zone as shown in the left panel of figure  [ butterfly ] .",
    "the pattern does not look as regular as in @xcite , which can be explained by the interaction of the corona and convection zone .",
    "initially the interior rotation profile is constant in cylinders with a positive gradient of angular velocity at low latitudes . in the hydrodynamic state , affected by rotation",
    ", the convective turbulence re - shapes the rotation profile within the convection zone , while in the convectively stable coronal layer only viscosity is at play .",
    "after a dynamically important magnetic field has been generated by the dynamo action , it influences the rotation as well . in the corona , where the density is much lower than in the convection zone",
    ", the lorentz force can dominate over the coriolis force , see equation  ( [ mom ] ) , and have a greater influence on the angular velocity . in our simulation the velocities in the corona saturate not before @xmath63 .",
    "the differential rotation profile is solar - like , see figure  [ meri ] .",
    "the equator rotates faster than the poles and the contours of constant rotation show a _ spoke - like _ pattern  especially at low latitudes .",
    "this is the first time a spoke - like profile has been found in dns in combination with equatorward migration .",
    "@xcite , whose setup is similar to ours in the convection zone , found that the contours of constant rotation are significantly more cylindrical at similarly high coriolis numbers .",
    "this could be due to the interaction between the coronal layer and the convection zone",
    ". there might be even an indication of a surface shear layer at latitudes @xmath64 .",
    "the meridional circulation shows a clockwise pattern  in contrast to the sun . instead of a poleward flow near the surface , as in the sun ,",
    "the flow is equatorward .",
    "this might be one possible explanation for the equatorward migration of the magnetic field .",
    "the field would then be dragged along with the fluid motion to the equator .",
    "but the magnetic field shows an equatorward migration throughout the convection zone , and the anti - solar meridional circulation seems to be shallow with a return flow in the middle of the convection zone . in our simulation",
    "the meridional circulation seems not to have a connection with the equatorward migration and the generation of the field .",
