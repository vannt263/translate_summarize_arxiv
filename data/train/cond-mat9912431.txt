    "this expression was obtained in the diffusion approximation for the isotropic scattering by randomly distributed scatterers with a short - range potential .",
    "nevertheless it is universally used in the analysis of experimental data to extract the phase breaking time and its temperature dependence through the fitting of experimental curves .",
    "it should be pointed out that @xmath8 determined in this way is a fitting parameter rather than the phase breaking time because some deviation of experimental curves from eq.([eq3 ] ) takes place in almost without exception .",
    "this deviation may result from some correlations in distribution of scatterers , scattering anisotropy , or long - range potential fluctuations in real 2d systems .",
    "this may be a possible reason of the saturation of @xmath9 with decreasing temperature as it is seen in some experiments.@xcite    in the previous paper we have developed a new approach to the analysis of anomalous magnetoresistance which makes it possible to obtain the information about the statistics of closed paths from the magnetic field dependence of magnetoresistance .",
    "this approach provides the basis for a new method of analysis of negative magnetoresistance due to weak localization suppression . in the present paper",
    "we demonstrate the potentials of this method as it is applied for interpretation of concrete experimental results obtained for gaas / ingaas / gaas quantum wells .",

    "the @xmath34-doped by si layers are arranged in them on both sides of the well at the distance 100  . in this paper",
    "we present the experimental results for two structures of different types which are refereed as structure i and structure ii , respectively . the measurements carried out in wide ranges of magnetic fields ( up to 6 t ) and temperatures ( 0.4 - 40 k ) show that in structures investigated only one size - quantized subband is occupied . the main contribution to",
    "the conductivity comes from the electrons in the quantum well of in@xmath32ga@xmath33as . the electron density and mobility for structure i are @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xmath38/(v sec ) , respectively . for structure",

    "the magnetic field dependencies of the conductivity for both structures for low magnetic fields and different temperatures are shown in fig .",

    "the main contribution to the negative magnetoresistance in the range @xmath42 t for structure i and @xmath43 t for structure ii comes from the weak localization effect , while in the range @xmath44 t for structure i and @xmath45 t for structure ii it results from the correction to the conductivity due to electron - electron interaction .",
    "notice that the positive magnetoresistance due to weak antilocalization effect was observed in analogous structures for low magnetic fields in refs . .",
    "this effect is observed when the spin relaxation time @xmath46 is less than the phase relaxation time .",
    "the positive magnetoresistance is absent in both our structures ( for example , see the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , where magnetoresistance of structure ii for very low magnetic fields is shown ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that the conductivity of the structures studied in ref .",
    "was order of magnitude larger than that in our case therefore the phase relaxation time was longer , too .",
    "the phase relaxation time in our case lies in the range @xmath47 sec ( see below ) . comparing this value with @xmath48 sec determined in ref .",
    "we have @xmath49 for our structures .",
    "another reason for the absence of positive magnetoresistance in our case is the fact that , in contrast to structures investigated in ref .",
    "our structures are symmetric in the growth direction .",
    "usually the expression ( [ eq3 ] ) is used to analyze the negative magnetoresistance , taking @xmath7 and @xmath9 as fitting parameters .",
    "the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] have been obtained in this way and , at first glance , they are in good agreement with the experimental data in the range of magnetic field @xmath50 . for structure",
    "i this procedure gives @xmath51 , @xmath52 sec for @xmath53 k. however , the more detailed analysis reveals the difference between the theory and the experimental data ( dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath54 vary in the range of @xmath55 and @xmath56 sec , respectively , when the fitting procedure is undertaken in different intervals of @xmath57 within the range @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the accuracy of determination of @xmath7 and @xmath9 values is @xmath59% .",
    "the ratio @xmath60 for this structure is @xmath61 for the temperature range @xmath62 k.    analogous data treatment for structure ii gives @xmath63 , @xmath64 sec for @xmath53 k and the ratio @xmath65 for the temperature range @xmath66 k. in the strict sense the expression ( [ eq3 ] ) is not valid for this structure because the scattering potential is smooth and the scattering is anisotropic .",
    "nevertheless it provides a good agreement with the experimental data ( fig.1 b ) .",
    "it is commonly believed that lower than unity value of @xmath7 results from the electron - electron interaction ( maki - tompson term ) .",
    "however , below it is shown that such value of @xmath7 in structure ii is the result of failure of the diffusion approximation due to poor @xmath28 ratio .",
    "the temperature dependencies of @xmath9 are plotted in fig.[fig2 ] for both structures , and as is seen @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "this means that the inelasticity of electron - electron interaction is the main mechanism of the phase relaxation.@xcite    =    now we demonstrate new possibilities of analysis of experimental data provided by the method described above .",
    "it is obvious that the method is applicable for low magnetic fields , @xmath69 , where the interference contribution to the negative magnetoresistance is dominant . as is seen from eq.([eq6 ] )",
    "the information about the statistics of closed paths can be obtained from the fourier transform of @xmath70 .",
    "but the value @xmath71 , not @xmath72 , is experimentally measured . it is easily shown that the fourier transform of the experimental curve @xmath73 padded with zeros at @xmath74 is close to that of @xmath75 at @xmath76 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the fourier transforms of @xmath77 for different temperatures are presented .",
    "the area range where the fourier transform @xmath15 is shown is bounded .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath24 is determines by signal - to - noise ratio in the experimental curves @xmath78 .",
    "the minimum value is determined by the range of magnetic field , @xmath79 , where the weak localization effect is dominant .",
    "we assume that @xmath80 is about @xmath81 t for structure i and @xmath82 t for structures ii .",
    "=    =    as is seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) , the function @xmath83 must be linear with respect to @xmath84 with the slope @xmath26 .",
    "it is seen from fig.[fig4 ] that the corresponding curves are really close to straight lines for both structures , but the slopes are different : @xmath85 for structure i and @xmath86 for structure ii .",
    "thus , for structure i with @xmath87 the value of @xmath26 is close to that obtained in the improved diffusion approximation @xmath88 , but somewhat larger than the value @xmath89 obtained in the numerical simulation.@xcite    in structure ii the ratio @xmath90 is significantly larger and the diffusion approximation fails . besides , the fact that the impurities are arranged in the barriers in this structure leads to smooth scattering potential and anisotropic scattering .",
    "to our knowledge , there are no theoretical results for this case .",
    "however , it is valid to say that the anisotropy of scattering and smooth scattering potential do not change the statistics of closed trajectories with the lengths significantly larger than the mean free length .",
    "the numerical calculations beyond the diffusion approximation for isotropic scattering @xcite show that @xmath91 at @xmath92 .",
    "it is close to @xmath26 value for structure i with @xmath93 .",
    "thus we believe that the main reason for small value of @xmath26 in this structure is failure of diffusion approximation .",
    "=    the method put forward in this paper gives a possibility to determine the area distribution function @xmath13 .",
    "the temperature dependencies of @xmath94 for several @xmath24 are plotted in fig .",
    "the value of @xmath95 for a given @xmath24 increases when @xmath17 due to increase of @xmath16 .",
    "thus the extrapolation of curves @xmath96 to @xmath19 ( see eg .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) ) gives the value of @xmath97 for the corresponding value of @xmath24 .",
    "the results of such a data treatment for both structures are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5]b .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5]b the area distribution functions obtained within the improved diffusion approximation@xcite with parameters corresponding to the structures investigated are presented too .",
    "one can see that at low @xmath24 the experimental area dependencies of @xmath98 are close to the theoretical ones for both structures . for @xmath99 @xmath41 the more rapid decreasing of the experimental curves is observed and for @xmath100 @xmath41 the experimental values of @xmath101 is @xmath102 times lower than the theoretical values .",
    "there are two reasons for such a discordance : ( i ) the number of closed trajectories with large areas in real samples is smaller than the theoretical one due to , for instance , the long - range potential fluctuations ; ( ii ) the saturation of the phase breaking length with decreasing temperature from @xmath103 k has to lead to underestimating the value of @xmath101 for large @xmath24 in the data processing described above .",
    "it should be noted that some evidence for @xmath104 saturation was obtained only for temperatures @xmath105 k. @xcite our measurements were carried out at significantly higher temperature , @xmath106 k. so , we believe that the rapid decreasing of @xmath101 for @xmath99 @xmath41 ( fig .  [ fig5 ]  b ) results from the shortage of large trajectories , rather than from the saturation of @xmath104 .",
    "thus , one can see that the area distribution functions of closed paths coincide practically for both structures , but the area dependencies of the average length of closed trajectories are distinguished .",
    "this distinction results from different @xmath107 ratio .",
    "just this fact leads to the lower than unity value of prefactor @xmath7 in structure ii rather than the electron - electron interaction .",
    "the new method of the analysis of negative magnetoresistance is used .",
    "this method provides a possibility to obtain an information on the statistics of closed paths .",
    "the experimental studies of negative magnetoresistance show that the area dependence of average length of closed paths depends on @xmath107 ratio : @xmath108 at @xmath109 ; @xmath110 at @xmath111 .",
    "this fact leads to the lower than unity value of prefactor when one fits the experimental results to hikami expression rather than contribution of electron - electron interaction ( maki - tompson term ) .",
    "the experimental area distribution functions of closed paths are close to these obtained in improved diffusion approximation at low area , but distinct at large one .",
    "the shortage of large trajectories by long range potential fluctuation is a possible reason for such distinction .",
