    "<S> it is desirable to implement an efficient quantum information process demanding fewer quantum resources . </S>",
    "<S> we designed two compact quantum circuits for determinately implementing four - qubit toffoli and fredkin gates on single - photon systems in both the polarization and spatial degrees of freedom ( dofs ) via diamond nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centers in resonators . </S>",
    "<S> the gates are heralded by the electron spins associated with the diamond nv centers . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the ones with one dof , our implementations reduce the quantum resource and are robust against the decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> evaluations of fidelities and efficiencies of our gates show that our schemes may be implemented with current technology . </S>"
