    "random matrix theory ( rmt )  @xcite was first applied to physical systems in the context of nuclear physics  @xcite and has found application in condensed matter physics especially in the study of disordered systems .",
    "it has also been shown to play a crucial role in understanding how isolated quantum systems thermalize  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to classical mechanics there is no notion of a phase space in quantum mechanics .",
    "hence , the concept of quantum ergodicity ( thermalization ) is not very well understood , and is presently a very active area of research @xcite.it is believed that isolated quantum systems that thermalize generally do not have dynamics strongly constrained by conservation laws and are thus not integrable .",
    "these non - integrable systems can be characterized by random matrix ensembles depending on the symmetry of their hamiltonians .",
    "integrable models have infinite conserved quantities in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite , as a consequence of which they display no level repulsion and obey a poissonian level spacing distribution given by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is energy spacing measured in units of the mean level spacing . in contrast a non - integrable system has a finite number of conserved quantities even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "once , one has accounted for the corresponding symmetries , the rest of the energy spectrum displays level repulsion with @xmath2 as @xmath3 . depending on the symmetries of the system",
    ", @xmath4 can have the following forms :    1 .",
    "@xmath5 for the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , 2 .",
    "@xmath6 for the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) ( where time reversal symmetry is broken ) 3 .",
    "@xmath7 for gaussian symplectic ensemble(gse ) ( where time reversal symmetry is preserved but spin rotation symmetry is broken ) .    in the presence of disorder",
    ", the situation is different .",
    "the disorder renders the system non - integrable by destroying conservation laws that may have existed in its absence .",
    "however , it is possible that for a sufficiently strong value of disorder , the level spacing distribution is poissonian indicative of localization in the system . for non - interacting disordered systems ( without spin orbit coupling ) , it is known that in one and two dimensions , even an infinitesimal amount of disorder is sufficient to localize all states in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite . in three dimension even in the thermodynamic limit one needs to have a finite amount of disorder to localize all states .",
    "significantly less is understood about the nature of localization for interacting disordered systems .",
    "the one parameter scaling theory for non - interacting systems  @xcite is expected not to apply in this case and there is much debate over whether there is a finite amount of disorder required for localization and what its dependence on interaction strength and dimensionality is  @xcite .",
    "we do not attempt to join the debate in this paper focussing instead on systems with weak enough disorder that localization does not occur . in a previous work with ramaswamy",
    "we investigated how integrability in a one - dimensional interacting system is destroyed by perturbations  @xcite .",
    "we found that the scale of the perturbation that caused a crossover to non - integrability goes to zero with increasing system size as a power law in the system size whose exponent is independent of microscopic details .",
    "we conjectured that the value of this exponent was dependent only on the random matrix ensemble describing the non - integrable system which was of the goe type . in this paper , we elaborate on that claim by studying systems described by different random matrix ensembles and and investigate the crossovers among them .",
    "we also investigate the effect of dimensionality on the finite - size scaling of the perturbation that causes the crossover . to this end , it is most convenient for us to look at models which have disorder in addition to interactions .    in this paper , we have looked at two disordered models , 1 ) a one dimensional interacting model of hard - core bosons and 2 ) a three dimensional model of non - interacting particles with spin - orbit - coupling(soc ) .",
    "these models allow us to realize phases with poissonian , goe , gue and gse level spacing distributions and thus study the crossovers among them .",
    "our main result is that the scale of perturbations responsible for the crossovers among the different classes of systems goes to zero with increasing system size as a power law , with an exponent that appears to depend only on the random matrix ensembles of the classes independent of microscopic details .",
    "we consider the one - dimensional heisenberg spin-1/2 chain containing @xmath8 spins with random on site magnetic field in the @xmath9-direction .",
    "the hamiltonian for this system is :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the spin operator at site @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the nearest neighbor exchange constant .",
    "@xmath14 is a random magnetic field in the @xmath9 direction , which is uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath15 $ ] .    for this model @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the time reversal operator and",
    "therefore , @xmath18 the presence of a magnetic field breaks the time reversal symmetry .",
    "however , the antiunitary operator @xmath19 commutes with @xmath20 .",
    "the operator @xmath21 reverses the sign of @xmath22 and @xmath23 but not of @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 thus preserves an unconventional time reversal symmetry and the level spacing distribution for @xmath20 is goe type in the presence of a large enough random magnetic field that is not so large as to localize all states .",
    "introducing a three site interaction  @xcite , the hamiltonian becomes ,    @xmath25 } , \\label{eqn : hamiltonian_broken t}\\ ] ]    which breaks time reversal symmetry and unlike for the hamiltonian of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : hamiltonian ] , this time reversal symmetry violation can not be compensated by any anti - unitary spin reversal operator .",
    "the three spin term can be written as , @xmath26}&=&i j_{t}s_{j}^{z}\\epsilon_{jkl}s_{k}^{+}s_{l}^{- } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & i j_{t}s_{j}^{z}s_{j+1}^{+}s_{j+2}^{-}-i j_{t}s_{j}^{z}s_{j+2}^{+}s_{j+1}^{- } \\label{eqn : triple product term}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and using a holstein and primakoff transformation  @xcite this model can be mapped onto one of hardcore bosons .",
    "the spin operators in terms of the bosonic operators are @xmath27 where , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the creation and annihilation operators for the hard core bosons and @xmath30 is the number density operator .",
    "the resultant hamiltonian , which we have studied is thus ,    @xmath31    if @xmath32 , the model reduces to the integrable @xmath33 model of hardcore boson  @xcite .",
    "non - zero @xmath14 makes the model non - integrable and also destroys its lattice translational symmetry .",
    "we have used exact diagonalization techniques to obtain all the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian and have able to reach up to @xmath34 sites at half filling .",
    "the results we report have been averaged over different realizations of disorder to achieve convergence .",
    "we consider a three - dimensional disordered system  @xcite with soc on a cubic lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model is given by : @xmath35 where @xmath36 labels the sites of the lattice and @xmath37 labels the spin .",
    "@xmath38 labels nearest neighbor pairs @xmath36 and @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath39 is @xmath40 random on - site potential which does not contain the spin index and thus does not violate time reversal invariance .",
    "@xmath39 is chosen from the interval @xmath41 of uniformly distributed random variables . the nearest neighbor hopping @xmath42 has the following form : @xmath43 where , @xmath44 is the spin orbit coupling strength and @xmath45,@xmath46 and @xmath47 are independent uniform random variables taken from the interval @xmath48 . for nonzero @xmath44 ,",
    "this model breaks spin rotation symmetry and hence its eigenvalues give a gse type level spacing distribution .",
    "when @xmath44 is zero , the model belongs to the goe class .",
    "a large value of @xmath49 will cause localization and the again energy eigenvalues will obey a poissonian level spacing distribution .",
    "we will restrict ourself to a region where model exhibits no localization .",
    "a study of the crossover from poissonian to gse level spacing statistics can be studied even in two dimensions for the model of eqn .",
    "[ eq : socham ] .",
    "however , the crossover from poissonian to goe statistics can not be examined in this model in two dimensions since this requires the soc to be turned off which will cause localization ( and no phase with goe statistics ) for any amount of disorder .    like the system described by eqn .",
    "[ eqn : hamiltonian ] , this model too has disorder and hence no lattice translation symmetry .",
    "we thus write down the hamiltonian in a real space basis to perform exact diagonalization to obtain all the energy eigenstates .",
    "we have been able to diagonalize systems with @xmath50 sites and a maximum value of @xmath51 .",
    "once again , we average over different realizations of disorder to obtain good statistics for the quantities of interest .",
    "setting @xmath52 in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : hamiltonian_hardcore ] we obtain an integrable model of hard - core bosons with poissonian level spacing statistics  @xcite . increasing the value of @xmath49 keeping @xmath53 , a crossover from poissonian to goe level spacing statistics",
    "is observed as shown in figure  [ fig : level spacing poi - goe ] .    for model",
    "ii , one can see a crossover from poisson to goe level spacing statistics as we increase the value of @xmath49 in eqn .",
    "[ eq : socham ] provided @xmath44 ( the soc strength ) in eqn .",
    "[ eq : intform ] is set to zero .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : poi_goe_3d ] .",
    "the intermediate distribution can be to a brody distribution  @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     for model ii , we have observed that the integrability breaking parameter which is responsible for the poissonian to goe / gse crossover goes to zero as a power law with exponent 1 and for the goe to gse crossover this exponent becomes 3/2.(figure  [ fig : level powerlaw goe - gue and poi - goe ] )    we have also studied a different version of model ii to investigate the poisson to gue and goe to gue crossovers .",
    "here , we have taken the nearest neighbor hoping matrix @xmath54 to have the following form , @xmath55 this model breaks time reversal symmetry .",
    "increasing @xmath44 and @xmath49 simultaneously we have observed a poissonian - gue crossover and then setting @xmath56 and increasing @xmath44 , a goe to gue crossover .",
    "the exponents of the power law scaling of the crossover value of the perturbation are 1 and 3/2 for the poissonian - gue and goe - gue cases respectively .",
    "why do we obtain the same exponent for the poissonian to gue and poissonian to gse crossovers as we do for poissonian to goe ?",
    "a possible answer is that the poissonian to gue and poissonian to gse crossovers can be thought of as a crossover first from poissonian to goe , which introduces level repulsion and then a crossover from goe to gue and gse through the breaking of additional symmetries ( time reversal for goe - gue and spin rotation invariance for goe - gse ) . for this interpretation to be correct",
    ", the fall off of the crossover value with system size for goe - gue and goe - gse has to be faster than for poissonian - goe .",
    "this is indeed the case for all the cases we have considered as can be seen from figure  [ fig : level powerlaw goe - gue and poi - goe ] .",
    "a second important question is why the poissonian - goe / gue / gse crossover scaling exponents are different for the two different models ?",
    "the reason does not seem to be that the models have different dimensionality .",
    "for instance , the poissonian - goe crossover for model ii is the same in both two and three dimensions .",
    "we conjecture that this difference can be attributed to the fact that model i contains interactions among the elementary degrees of freedom while model ii does not .",
    "this has a bearing on the integrable limits of these models as well in that the elementary degrees of freedom are correlated even in the integrable limit of model i and not model ii .",
    "this difference could well be responsible for the different exponents in the two models . to further investigate this and also the role of dimensionality",
    ", it would be desirable to obtain crossovers among all the different categories of ensembles in different dimensions .",
    "however , it is not possible for us to realize a goe phase in the non - interacting model in two dimensions owing to the fact that localization becomes operative in the absence of spin - orbit coupling and time reversal breaking in two dimensions . on the other hand ,",
    "it is difficult to study model i in more than one dimension since the presence of interactions greatly reduces the system sizes we can study in higher dimensions",
    ". a through investigation of the effect of interactions and dimensionality on the crossovers among different ensembles will require a study of more models which we will defer to a later work .",
    "we have investigated the finite scaling of perturbations which cause crossovers among different random matrix ensembles in two different models : a one dimensional model of interacting hard core bosons ( or equivalently spin 1/2 ) objects and a disordered model of non - interacting particles with disorder and spin - orbit coupling . obtaining the level spacing distribution using numerical exact diagonalization , we have found that the scaling is a power law for crossovers among all the different ensembles ( poissonian , goe , gue and gse ) that can be realized in these models and obtained the corresponding exponents .",
    "we find that the scaling from poissonian to any of the other ensembles is dominated by the poissonian - goe crossover which introduces level repulsion while the symmetry breaking that causes the goe - gue and goe - gse crossovers is a sub - dominant effect .",
    "we also conjecture that there is a difference in the scaling depnding on whether the elementary degrees of freedom interact or not .",
