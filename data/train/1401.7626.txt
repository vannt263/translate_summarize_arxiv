    "in the past decade an intrinsic wave - particle dualism in spiral waves has been highlighted  @xcite .",
    "this invites comparison with a growing number of macroscopic systems in which waves propagating in a nonlinear medium are associated with some degree of spatial localization  @xcite , including liquid ` walker ' droplets bouncing on a vibrated bath  @xcite , various optical solitons  @xcite and chemical wave segments  @xcite . among other common properties ,",
    "each of these examples exhibits nonspecular reflections from obstacles or medium perturbations  @xcite and the dynamics involved in the reflection process can be quite complex  @xcite .",
    "it is within this context that we have undertaken the present investigation .",
    "our study focuses on rotating spiral waves in a system with excitable dynamics .",
    "first witnessed experimentally in the belousov - zhabotinsky chemical oscillator  @xcite , they have since been discovered in diverse biological  @xcite , chemical  @xcite and physical  @xcite contexts . within two - dimensional homogeneous excitable media ,",
    "spiral waves typically rotate about an unexcited core of fixed radius and center .",
    "these are so - called _ rigidly rotating _ spirals .",
    "the rotation frequency is determined solely by medium properties , while the center of rotation and phase are determined by initial conditions . however , applying spatial or temporal perturbations to an otherwise homogeneous medium can cause the wave pattern to undergo a spatial displacement or _ drift _  @xcite . by tracking either the local rotation center , or the closely related wave tip , one may observe interesting trajectories as drifting spirals move through a medium .",
    "a noteworthy case is _ resonant _ drift  @xcite in which spatially uniform periodic driving is applied in resonance with the spiral rotation frequency . in this case",
    "the spiral core travels in a straight line with constant velocity . in a typical experimental domain ,",
    "such a spiral will inevitably come close to a boundary , which may lead to a reflection in the drift trajectory  @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : reflection_examples ] .",
    "-field of the barkley model .",
    "both plots use the same length scale .",
    "the boundaries are generated by a step change in medium properties , indicated by gray shading at the left - hand edges .",
    "( a ) a ` small - core ' spiral wave approaches a boundary and doubles back on itself ; its reflection angle lies on the same side of the boundary normal as its incidence angle .",
    "( b ) a ` large - core ' spiral wave speeds up close to the boundary and travels alongside it for a short while before reflecting sharply away .",
    "( the plots were cropped to @xmath0 space units from simulations performed on a @xmath1 square domain , discretized in space with grid spacing @xmath2 and in time with time step @xmath3 .",
    "the step change was located @xmath4 space units from the left - hand domain wall .",

    "[ sec : methods ] . ) , width=312 ]    reflections are in general nonspecular : the incidence angle rarely equals the reflection angle . furthermore , the character of individual reflection trajectories depends on the medium in which the wave propagates , the properties of the boundary and the spiral s resonant drift velocity .",
    "numerical simulations of resonantly drifting spiral reflections were undertaken some time ago by biktashev and holden  @xcite , who laid the foundations of the asymptotic approach in a subsequent study  @xcite .",
    "their numerical work has recently been updated with more extensive simulations and the calculation of a large catalog of reflection trajectories  @xcite .",
    "a key feature of spiral wave reflections in these two studies is that the angle of reflection is essentially independent of the angle of incidence for a large range of incident angles .",
    "indeed , the reflection angle instead depends more strongly on the characteristics of the medium than on incident angle .",
    "this was predicted by biktashev and holden using an ordinary differential equation ( ode ) model based on the simplifying assumption that the component of the spiral s drift velocity caused by interaction with the boundary decays exponentially with distance from the boundary  @xcite .",
    "however , a more detailed theoretical treatment is required to fully understand the mechanism behind spiral reflection . while separate theoretical accounts of both resonant drift  @xcite and spatial medium inhomogeneities  @xcite ( which may act as boundaries to drift ) already exist , it is the combination and interaction of these two phenomena which we must consider here .",
    "a good candidate for an updated approach is to use the theory of _ response functions _",
    "@xcite which has developed and matured in the years since the biktashev - holden study .",
    "response functions are adjoint modes to the neutral symmetry modes of a spiral which characterize how the position and rotation phase of a spiral react to asymptotically small perturbations . in practical terms ,",
    "response functions allow us to reduce the partial differential equations ( pdes ) governing the whole medium to the dynamics of just three real variables  the two spatial coordinates of the wave rotation center and the rotational phase .",
    "in this paper we bring the reflection of drifting spirals into this asymptotic framework by considering the superposition of two small perturbations : one corresponding to resonant forcing generating drift and the other corresponding to a step change in a medium parameter acting as a boundary to drift .",
    "previous studies addressed both effects independently using response functions  @xcite . while the approach is strictly applicable only in the limit of slow resonant drift and weak boundary effects , we show that it nevertheless can capture , and thereby explain , most of the important features of spiral wave reflections outside of this asymptotic limit .",
    "the underlying dynamics of the excitable medium are well described by models in the class of reaction - diffusion pdes on the plane : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a vector of @xmath9 state variables for the medium , @xmath10 describes the excitable dynamics at each point in space dependent on a vector of @xmath11 parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 is a ( symmetric ) diffusion matrix .",
    "we are interested in models that admit solutions rotating with angular frequency @xmath14 about a center point @xmath15 .",
    "that is , rigidly rotating waves of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 are polar coordinates centered at @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the fiducial phase of the spiral at @xmath20 .",
    "note that due to symmetries of the plane , if eq .",
    "admits a solution of the form in eq .",
    ", then there are infinitely many such solutions related by symmetry , and this is captured by the fact that @xmath18 and @xmath19 are arbitrary constants .",
    "we refer to @xmath14 as the _ natural _ frequency since it is an intrinsic property of the medium , whereas @xmath18 and @xmath19 depend on initial data .",
    "suppose we perturb the medium slightly .",
    "in the limit of weak perturbations , this induces small shifts in the rotation center @xmath18 and the phase @xmath19 , leaving the shape of the spiral otherwise unchanged .",
    "thus the response of the spiral to weak perturbations is a trajectory through the space of solutions of the form eq .  , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 depend on time .",
    "mathematically , we treat such a perturbation as the addition of a vector @xmath21 to the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    "it can be shown using perturbation methods  @xcite that to first order in @xmath22 , the time derivatives of @xmath23 and @xmath24 are proportional to the @xmath25 inner products @xmath26 of the spiral s response functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 with the perturbation vector , averaged over one full rotation period @xmath29 : @xmath30 where we use the identification @xmath31 .",
    "technical details can be found in the appendix and elsewhere  @xcite , but the essence of these equations is the following .",
    "the response functions are adjoint fields corresponding to the symmetries of the reaction - diffusion system [ eq .  ] .",
    "@xmath32 is @xmath33-valued and corresponds to the presence of rotational symmetry .",
    "one can think of the perturbation , @xmath34 , as providing an infinitesimal impulse @xmath35 along the direction of the symmetry ( phase @xmath19 in this case ) , at each time @xmath36 .",
    "equation   captures the effect of all such impulses over one rotation period to give the rate of change in @xmath19 .",
    "the response function @xmath28 is @xmath37-valued and corresponds to the two translational symmetries . here",
    "the perturbation at each time @xmath36 provides the spiral with an infinitesimal impulse in the direction @xmath38 rotated by @xmath39 due to the underlying natural rotation of the spiral .",
    "these contributions , averaged over one rotation period , give the drift velocity .",
    "importantly , a change in @xmath19 typically implies a change in the direction of drift .",
    "response functions have been computed numerically for a variety of spiral waves in previous studies . for various cases , including that of the spiral waves we study here , the support of these functions was found to be highly localized around the spiral rotation center  @xcite .",
    "thus , a spiral wave drifts only in response to perturbations very close to the core .",
    "that is , it behaves as a particle whose position may be identified with the rotation center @xmath18 .",
    "we are interested in the case where a resonantly forced spiral moves towards , and reflects from , a boundary in the medium .",
    "this is a combination of two perturbations to the original reaction - diffusion equations  a homogeneous , time - periodic one that causes resonant drift of the spiral and a spatial one that imposes a boundary to the drifting spiral .",
    "let us suppose the resonant forcing can be described by some @xmath40 . in practice",
    "we will consider the simple case of harmonic forcing of one of the medium parameters at the natural frequency @xmath14 . likewise , suppose that the effect of a boundary may be formulated in @xmath41 .",
    "the type of boundary we shall consider is a sharp interface along the line @xmath42 between two media with different excitability properties .",
    "although this is not a physical barrier to wave propagation , a drifting spiral core may nevertheless reflect from the spatial inhomogeneity ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : reflection_examples ] and ref .",
    "we refer to this as a _ step boundary_. it may be considered as a weak perturbation provided that the step change in medium parameters is small . in previous studies",
    "a neumann or ` no - flux ' boundary was also considered .",
    "while this type of boundary condition can not be treated as a weak perturbation , it has previously been observed that reflections from a step inhomogeneity are qualitatively similar to the no - flux case  @xcite .",
    "the total perturbation to the medium can be written as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 represent the strengths of the respective ` step ' and ` forcing ' perturbations .",
    "one can immediately see from eqs .   and   that the effects of the two perturbations on @xmath45 and @xmath46 are a linear superposition and",
    "may therefore be considered separately .",
    "it may consequently be shown ( see the appendix ) that the equations of motion for the spiral center @xmath47 and phase @xmath19 are of the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 are contributions due to the step boundary and @xmath52 , @xmath53 are contributions due to the resonant forcing .",
    "these are given by integrals of the form in eqs .   and  .",
    "while the functions depend in detail on the specific model used and the particular spiral wave under consideration , their general form , in particular their respective dependence on @xmath54 and @xmath19 as indicated , is independent of these details .",
    "since the step boundary is located along the line @xmath42 in the original pde , the dynamics of the spiral depends only on the distance @xmath54 of the spiral center from step boundary and does not depend on @xmath55 .",
    "likewise , since the step perturbation is time independent , its effect , when averaged over a full spiral rotation , can not depend on the spiral s phase @xmath19 .",
    "the form of the functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 and the role of @xmath19 are quite important . in the appendix",
    "we show that for sinusoidal resonant forcing of a medium parameter : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 is a real constant for each model and set of parameter choices . hence , for a given spiral wave and given forcing amplitude , the drift velocity due to resonant forcing is , in the asymptotic limit , constant with direction determined by the phase @xmath19 .",
    "this direction of drift can change as a result of interaction with the boundary , i.e. ,  the function @xmath51 , but not due to periodic forcing alone .",
    "equations  ,   and   reduce the spiral dynamics from a set of nonlinear pdes to three coupled autonomous nonlinear odes .",
    "the functions @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 on the right - hand sides must in practice be obtained numerically by taking appropriate inner products with numerically computed response functions .",
    "nevertheless , evaluating the right - hand sides and then numerically solving the odes can be done quickly with minimal computational resources .",
    "it is worth noting that the essential dynamical quantities @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath19 are the same variables that biktashev and holden used in their asymptotic theory of spiral reflections  @xcite . moreover , we stress that while the variable @xmath19 was introduced as the phase of the spiral wave , its role in the reduced system becomes the direction of drift due to periodic forcing .",
    "the previous discussion of response functions did not depend on any specific model . here , we consider spiral wave solutions in the standard barkley model  @xcite , for which @xmath59 : @xmath60 the two state variables @xmath61 and @xmath62 capture , respectively , the excitation and recovery processes of the medium .",
    "parameters @xmath63 control the threshold for excitation and @xmath64 sets the timescale of the fast excitation process , relative to recovery .",
    "( the parameter @xmath65 is usually called @xmath22 but we will not use that notation here . ) for fixed parameter @xmath65 and variable @xmath66 , the section of parameter space which admits rigidly rotating spiral wave solutions is divided roughly into two regimes distinguished by the size of the rotation core .",
    "the reflective properties of so - called _ small- _ and _ large - core _ spirals markedly differ  @xcite and we therefore divide our study along these lines .    throughout our study",
    "we have varied the @xmath67 parameter to create the step inhomogeneity by considering @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the heaviside step function .",
    "resonant forcing has been applied homogeneously by varying the excitability @xmath65 as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the forcing frequency required to obtain resonant drift and @xmath72 is some initial forcing time ( the choice of which is discussed in the appendix ) . for our results in sec .

    "the values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 have been chosen small enough that the perturbed medium remains in the same parameter regime ( of small- or large - core rigid rotation ) as the unperturbed parameters .",
    "the response functions and natural rotation frequencies for various small- and large - core spirals in the barkley model were calculated on a polar grid using the software dxspiral  @xcite .",
    "the numerical methods are detailed in ref .",
    "a disk of radius @xmath76 was used in the small core with @xmath77 angular grid points and @xmath78 radial grid points . in the large core the radius size was increased to @xmath79 and the number of radial grid points used was @xmath80 .",
    "the resulting response function discretizations were used to numerically compute the right - hand sides of eqs .  ,  , and   ( see the appendix for the specific integrals ) , again using dxspiral .",
    "reflection trajectories were calculated by timestepping the resulting three dynamical variables from chosen initial conditions .",
    "direct numerical simulations of the barkley model pdes were also performed for comparison with the response function predictions .",
    "these were computed using the standard finite - difference techniques described in refs .",
    "these simulations use unusually high precision to ensure that they correctly capture the spiral rotation frequency  ( * ? ? ?",
    "( the simulations involve forcing at the natural frequency , i.e.  @xmath73 , obtained very accurately from dxspiral .",

    "model parameter values are given later in the text .",
    "before presenting our response function calculations , we make a note concerning incident and reflected angles .",

    "one considers incident angles only in the range @xmath91 $ ] , since , due to symmetry in the @xmath92-direction , trajectories at equal angles either side of the normal correspond to physically identical situations .",

    "[ sec : theory ] and the appendix we have implicitly set @xmath94 to correspond to clockwise rotation .",

    "note also the antisymmetry of @xmath51 .",
    "far to the left of the boundary , @xmath115 tends to a non - zero ( negative in this case ) constant .",
    "this is because the spiral s rotation frequency in the left half - plane , with the perturbed model parameter @xmath116 , differs from the ` natural ' frequency @xmath14 of the unperturbed spiral in the right half - plane .",

    "this effect itself does not cause the subsequent reflection from the boundary .",
    "the motion away from the boundary is rather due to the @xmath19 dynamics .",

    "each spiral wave reaches this sign change of @xmath131 in essentially the same state : with @xmath134 and @xmath54 close to the edge of the boundary region .",

    "large - core spiral waves are particularly susceptible to this as their rotation frequencies and tip orbits vary rapidly with parameters  @xcite . in the dns",
    "there is a shift from the unperturbed rotation frequency @xmath14 ( as calculated to high accuracy by dxspiral ) due to small but finite spatial discretization errors , as well as weak nonlinear effects at finite perturbation strength .",

    "however , the main value of the response function approach is the _ qualitative _ understanding it brings to how interactions with a boundary lead to different types of reflections in various situations . several of the most significant features of spiral wave reflections , previously observed in simulations at higher drift speeds and greater step inhomogeneities  @xcite , are nevertheless captured qualitatively by the asymptotic analysis .",
    "consequently , we have been able to understand the essential causes of many interesting aspects of spiral wave reflections .    as stated in the introduction ,",
    "the primary characteristic of spiral wave reflections is that across a wide range of model parameters , the reflected angle is approximately constant for large ranges of incident angle .",
    "this reflection angle ` plateau ' is present in the response function results in both small- and large - core cases . in the small - core case",
    ", it was previously demonstrated numerically that the value of this constant angle increases toward @xmath162 as the resonant drift velocity decreases  @xcite .",
    "our asymptotic results reveal the limiting case of this trend , yielding only reflected angles very close to @xmath163 and we have shown exactly why the reflected angle is essentially constant across a wide range of parameter space .",
    "another significant feature observed in prior numerical simulations of reflections is that , unlike the small - core case , for large - core spirals the reflected angle _ increases _ with increasing drift velocity  @xcite .",
    "this effect is clearly present in the asymptotics ( figs .",

    "[ fig : xphitrajs ] .",
    "furthermore , general consideration of the differences between small- and large - core spiral waves at the asymptotic level has led to explanations of the diversity of behaviors between the two cases .",
    "finally , we note that the non - trivial shape , closest boundary approach distance , and relative drift speeds that are obtained and explained via the response function analysis are all observed qualitatively beyond the asymptotic limit , in both the small- and large - core cases  @xcite .",
    "the work presented in this paper fits comfortably with that which is already known about spiral wave reflections .",
    "biktashev and holden  @xcite recognized many years ago that reflections are caused by small deviations from the natural rotation frequency on close approach to the boundary , which alter the direction of drift .",
    "they proposed asymptotic equations of motion for the rotation center and phase , positing that the boundary effects ( corresponding to @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 in our notation ) decay exponentially with distance from the boundary .",
    "these simple assumptions ably capture the overriding feature of spiral wave reflections  large ranges of approximately constant reflected angle  but beyond that the predictive qualities of the model are limited .",
    "our application of response functions to the reflection problem can be viewed as an extension of their efforts , removing the phenomenology for the case of a step boundary and allowing the boundary effects to be calculated accurately for any spiral wave .",
    "this extra information yields a much more detailed picture of the reflection dynamics , capturing the behavior near to the boundary as well as far from it and producing qualitatively meaningful reflection trajectories across a wide range of parameters .",
    "furthermore , we have calculated response functions in the large - core regime , which was not considered by biktashev and holden . here , we observe that the repulsive effect on spirals velocity normal to boundary ( @xmath49 ) decays more rapidly than the effect on the phase ( @xmath51)a finding which accounts for the differences between small- and large - core reflection angle results . this could not have been captured by the original biktashev - holden theory which for simplicity assumed that all boundary effects decay with respect to the same length scale .    beyond the features of spiral wave reflections considered here ,",
    "there are phenomena outside the asymptotic limit of small perturbations that are not predicted by the linear order response function approach . in the small - core regime ,",
    "a wider range of reflection angles are observed at higher forcing amplitudes than is captured by the asymptotic analysis . in the large - core regime , there exist so - called ` glancing ' and ` binding ' trajectories in which spiral waves respectively become temporarily and permanently attached to the boundary  @xcite",
    ". it would be desirable to address these phenomena theoretically  particularly the attachment behaviors which are especially at odds with what we have seen in the asymptotics .",
    "one potential approach could be to use a kinematic model , similar to the one introduced by di _",
    "et al . _  in ref .",
    "the principle idea is to split the motion of the spiral tip into angular and radial components , which depend on the tip rotation radius @xmath164 and rotation period @xmath165 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath164 and @xmath165 on the medium parameters ( or on some external perturbation ) may be determined empirically by direct simulation and thus used to model drift in a given scenario .",
    "recent papers have employed this method to reproduce the tip dynamics of small- and large - core spirals in the presence of a step inhomogeneity  @xcite and under periodic forcing of excitability  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a similar approach could be used to model spiral wave reflections .",

    "we can compute the integral over @xmath196 explicitly . changing the co - ordinate to @xmath203 and rescaling the step function , we have @xmath204",
    "as discussed in the main text , we see that the integral depends on the distance of the spiral center to the step inhomogeneity .",
