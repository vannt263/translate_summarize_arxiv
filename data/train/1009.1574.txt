    "the discovery of superfluidity in helium ii ( @xmath0he and @xmath1he ) has aroused interest in boson liquids .",
    "this was recently renewed and intensified due to the experimental obtaining of bose  einstein condensates ( becs ) in alkali metals .",
    "especially interesting is the formation and time evolution of both curved and straight vortices which appear in these media @xcite .    in two preceding papers @xcite ,",
    "referred to as part i and part ii , the time evolution of a pair of oppositely polarized linear vortices was examined . in part",
    "i , it was demonstrated that if such a pair is appropriately perturbed , a persistent set of identical circular vortices can be created .",
    "this was in full agreement with feynman s hypothesis @xcite mentioned in the title .",
    "in part ii , examples were given for the creation of several _ different _ circular vortices from one linear pair .",
    "in both cases , the bec was examined within the commonly used gross  pitaevskii model @xcite .",
    "the authors checked that all circular vortices created during the evolution satisfied known relations between their velocities and radii @xcite .    here , in part iii",
    ", we examine the interaction of circular vortices with either linear ones , or else with other circular vortices of different radii , again within the gross  pitaevskii model .",
    "the results are compared with those of other authors @xcite@xcite .",
    "in the present paper , as in parts i and ii , we describe a one - component bec by a single particle wavefunction of @xmath2 bosons of mass @xmath3 that obeys the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) type equation as formulated by gross @xcite and pitaevskii @xcite , @xmath4 where positive @xmath5 is the strength of the assumed @xmath6-function repulsive potential between bosons .",
    "both linear pair and circular stationary vortex solutions are known , of which only the last ones were shown to be stable ( see part i for references ) .",
    "similarly , and for the same reasons as in parts i and ii , we introduce dimensionless variables defined by the transformation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the chemical potential and @xmath9 is the background mass density .",
    "now , we obtain from ( [ trans ] ) and ( [ nls ] ) @xmath10 an initial condition used in parts i and ii , was @xmath11 where ( @xmath12 here has been interchanged with @xmath13 ) @xmath14 @xmath15 which is a model representing two oppositely polarized rectilinear vortices parallel to the @xmath16 plane and moving along the @xmath12 axis .",
    "the constant @xmath17 was chosen such that the velocity of the two rectilinear vortices ( along @xmath12 ) in the simulation would agree with @xmath18 , from the theory , see @xcite , table 2 . in spite of its simplicity",
    ", this model satisfies several criteria .",
    "the variable @xmath19 is scaled correctly , the wavefunction is zero at the centres of the two vortices , and far field behaviour is approximately correct ( of the order of @xmath20 ) .",
    "( we have doubts about the formula of jones and roberts , see appendix . )",
    "when the vortices are well separated , fetters formula @xcite is recovered ( @xmath21 , and @xmath22 as @xmath23 ) .    in this paper , an initial condition for a circular vortex will be used .",
    "it will be described by formulae of similar form to ( [ incond])([inconf ] ) , but with @xmath19 and @xmath12 replaced by @xmath24 the vortex in question will move along the @xmath12 axis with velocity close to @xmath18 taken from table 1 in @xcite , and the vortex lines ( @xmath25 ) at @xmath26 will intersect the plane @xmath27 at two points : @xmath28 .",
    "it is clear that the accuracy of such a model will increase as we increase the radius @xmath29 of the circular vortex .",
    "however , as we observed in all considered cases , even for not very large values of @xmath29 , the oscillations of the respective circular vortices during their motion were negligible .",
    "the nonlinear schrdinger equation in three dimensions ( [ nlstr ] ) was numerically solved by using a discrete fast fourier transform in @xmath19 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 to calculate the space derivatives ( pseudospectral algorithm ) , along with the leapfrog timestep .",
    "calculations were performed in a box : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , with the number of mesh points @xmath33@xmath34 , and @xmath35@xmath36 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were assumed , and the timestep was determined from the numerical stability condition .",
    "the details of our calculations are described in @xcite .",
    "figures 1 and 2 present collisions of a circular vortex parallel to the @xmath16 plane ( of radius @xmath37 ) with an arc of another such vortex of much larger radius @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "this arc , along with its periodic continuations to neighbouring periodicity boxes , models a linear vortex .",
    "( we have evidence that in this model , small disturbances of the initial condition for linear vortex , also involving small discontinuities in derivatives at the boundaries , only introduce small oscillations but do not change the main features of the evolution . ) as the advection velocity ( along the @xmath12 axis ) of a circular vortex is a decreasing function of its radius ( see e.g. figure 2 in part i ) , the circular vortex of radius @xmath37 will be much faster than the `` linear '' one which , in the situation shown in figures 1 and 2 , will imply their collision .    in figure 1 ,",
    "the @xmath19 components of the polarization vectors for the linear vortex and the neighbouring part of the circular one during collision have opposite signs , which locally resembles the situation analysed in parts i and ii , i.e. a pair of oppositely polarized rectilinear vortices . in figure 2 ,",
    "the pertinent signs are the same .",
    "nevertheless , strange as it may seem , the result of the collision in both cases is topologically the same , i.e. a ( distorted ) circular vortex and a linear vortex .",
    "this is in contradiction to the description of the two above mentioned collisions given by schwarz , see the second and third situation presented in figure 16 of @xcite . in both these situations ( in the schwarz description )",
    "the reconnection occurs only at one of the crossing points and the result of the collision is topologically different from the initial state ( one linear vortex only in the final state ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that different behaviour at the two crossing points ( occurrence and lack of reconnection ) is in fact also in contradiction to the results of koplik and levine who examined the evolution ( within the gp model ) of two neighbouring rectilinear vortices for various angles between their vorticity vectors .",
    "reconnection was demonstrated for angles between @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and no reconnection for @xmath42 .",
    "thus , in the case of two rectilinear vortices , the angle @xmath42 implied the same behaviour as that for @xmath43 . for the collisions shown in our figures 1 and 2 , the angles between vorticity vectors at two intersection points are the same and one should not expect different behaviour there .",
    "another question , however , is the applicability of the results of koplik and levine to the collisions shown in figures 1 and 2 , where one can only locally think in terms of rectilinear vortices during collision .",

    "the first view is along the @xmath19 axis.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    here we pause for some comments .",
    "firstly , we repeated the calculation but for the segment of the large circular vortex with opposite curvature . no difference between the results in both cases was observed .",
    "secondly , we performed a calculation for a similar initial vortex configuration , but with both colliding circular vortices having comparable radii .",
    "we obtained essentially the same results ( i.e. topologically , both results could be treated as identical ) .",
    "so the exact values of the radii of the colliding vortices are not important , if only the radius of one of the vortices is finite .",
    "even more , a similar scenario of the collision of two circular oppositely polarized vortices is observed if the vortices have identical radii and their symmetry axes are parallel to each other but do not coincide .",
    "again two reconnections at the crossing points and two distorted circular vortices after collision are obtained , see @xcite .",
    "note also that the initial conditions presented in figures 1 and 2 are symmetric with respect to the plane @xmath55 passing through both centres of colliding rings .",
    "this implies that this symmetry lasts during the evolution .",
    "this was the case in our results even if it is not obvious from figures 1 and 2 .",
    "as we have mentioned earlier , collisions as considered here were also investigated by k w schwarz @xcite who performed the first important step towards a formal description of the dynamics of vortices in becs kws85 , kws88 .",
    "schwarz was able to explain many features of the vortex dynamics in these media , including the interaction with walls . in order to describe some simple observed effects , such as `` avoiding collision '' between parallel vortices and `` attraction '' by antiparallel ones , schwarz introduced explicitly an `` artificial force '' acting between cores of neighbouring vortex lines .",
    "this made it possible to reach many detailed results , but also introduced the risk of some of these results being questionable .",
    "the disagreement with our results has an important consequence .",
    "if in the course of the collision in question only one reconnection point appears , the two vortex lines join together into one vortex line and the degree of entanglement of the system of these lines increases .",
    "our result , on the contrary , states that such coplanar collisions can not increase the degree of entanglement and such a quick generation of vortex entanglement as showed schwarz in his figure 4 in @xcite can not come about in this fashion .",

    "in parts i and ii the authors gave several examples of how circular vortices can be created from pairs of oppositely polarized rectilinear vortices perturbed sinusoidally in space . here",
    "we will show that similar circular vortices can be created , if a circular vortex passes by another , oppositely polarized coaxial circular vortex of somewhat larger radius .",
    "this seems to contradict what koplik and levine say when considering a coaxial collision of oppositely polarized circular vortices of different radii , ( , p. 4746 ) :    `` two cases occur if two rings of _ different _ sizes approach on axis : if the ratio of radii is large , the rings simply leapfrog each other .",
    "if , however , the radii are comparable , one again sees annihilation similar to the equal - sized case , except that the partially overlapping rings continue to translate during the merger stage preceding annihilation . ''",
    "different behaviour , resulting in reconnections and formation of circular vortices , should be possible if the the collision of the circular rings is somehow perturbed . in the case of rectilinear vortices",
    ", this perturbation was introduced externally . in the case of circular vortices , it could result from interaction ( in the sense of schwarz @xcite ) of the colliding vortices with other circular vortices close by during the collision .",
    "such situations are very probable in real condensates . in this paper , they have been modelled in the simplest possible way , i.e. by choosing the dimensions of the periodicity box in the plane parallel to the colliding vortices ( @xmath16 plane ) to be comparable to the diameters of the colliding vortices . with this choice ,",
    "the perturbation is due to the interaction of the colliding vortices with their neighbouring periodic images parallel to the @xmath16 plane .",
    "there are four closest neighbours in the directions of the @xmath19 and @xmath13 axis , four further ones in the directions rotated by @xmath42 along the axis of the colliding vortices , still more along the @xmath19 and @xmath13 axis , etc .",
    "this evidently suggests that the number of circular vortices after collision should be a multiple of four .",
