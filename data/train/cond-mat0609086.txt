    "transport in a two dimensional electron gas is affected by the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the most common signature is the weak ( anti)localization .",
    "it is a small correction to the conductance due to the interference of time reversed trajectories .",
    "the sign of the correction depends on the presence or absence of the spin - orbit scattering .",
    "the correction is suppressed if a time reversal symmetry breaking magnetic field is present@xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit term in the hamiltonian has a form of a non - abelian vector potential@xcite . in the case of quantum dots ,",
    "if the spin - orbit coupling strength is position independent , a gauge transformation can be done , which results in an effective hamiltonian with reduced spin - orbit coupling , and a rich variety of symmetry classes @xcite . if the spin - orbit coupling depends on the position the transformation can not be done any more@xcite . as a consequence , the accessible symmetry classes are the three standard classes of dyson , classifying the systems according to the presence or absence of time reversal and spin rotation symmetry .    for quantum dots with chaotic dynamics random matrix theory",
    "gives a convenient way to describe the transport properties , provided that the electron transit time @xmath0 is much shorter than the other time scales of the problem ( mean dwell time @xmath1 , spin - orbit time @xmath2 , magnetic time @xmath3 , inverse level spacing)@xcite .",
    "constructing the appropriate rmt models for the crossover between the symmetry classes , the magnetic field and spin - orbit coupling dependence of the average conductance was calculated in refs . .",
    "the theoretical results are confirmed by numerical simulations @xcite and they are in good agreement with the experiments @xcite .",
    "if one would like to calculate the averages of other transport properties , such as the shot noise power , higher order cumulants of the distribution of the transmitted charge , or any other linear statistics , the density of transmission eigenvalues is needed @xcite .",
    "jalabert et al.@xcite gave the weak localization correction to the transmission eigenvalue density for chaotic quantum dots belonging to dyson s three symmetry classes .",
    "our work extends this result to the crossover regime between these classes .",
    "we present a calculation of the dependence of the weak localization correction to the transmission eigenvalue density on spin - orbit coupling and perpendicular magnetic field . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we restrict our attention to symmetric dots , i.e. we assume that the two leads attached to the cavity support the same number of channels @xmath4 , and for technical reasons we consider the case of @xmath5 .",
    "in some other sense we complement the work done by nazarov @xcite , who calculated the crossover behaviour of the weak localization correction to the transmission eigenvalue density for disordered samples in dimensions @xmath6 . here",
    "we give the results for @xmath7 corresponding to a quantum dot .",
    "the study of the transmission eigenvalue density is interesting not only because of the practical implications related to the linear statistics , but it is instructive by itself as well , since it gives a deeper insight to the weak ( anti)localization phenomenon . in the cases of dyson s symmetry classes the weak localization correction to the transmission eigenvalue density is of the form of dirac delta peaks at the endpoints of the spectrum@xcite .",
    "our analytical , closed - form result shows that these peaks broaden in the crossover regime , but the correction still remains singular .",
    "furthermore , similarly to higher dimensional cases of ref .  , it is possible to identify the peaks as originating from the singlet and triplet sectors of the cooperon modes of conventional diagrammatic perturbation theory .",
    "our result also enables us to study the transition from weak localization to weak antilocalization on the level of transmission eigenvalues .    as applications ,",
    "we calculate the weak localization correction to the conductance , the shot noise power and the third cumulant of the distribution of the transmitted charge . in the case of the conductance",
    "we recover the result of ref .  , giving a verification of our calculations .",
    "for the shot noise we find that for the symmetric cavities studied in this paper the weak localization correction is absent in the full crossover regime .",
    "the third cumulant of the transmitted charge behaves the opposite way .",
    "it is `` crossover induced '' in the sense that the classical contribution vanishes @xcite and the weak localization term is nonzero only in the crossover regime .",

    "let us consider a chaotic quantum dot with two leads attached to it .",
    "we assume , that the number of propagating modes is the same for both leads .",
    "we choose the spin - orbit coupling to depend on the position to avoid the reduction of the coupling strength .",
    "the weak magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the dot .",
    "the assumptions for the spin - orbit coupling and the magnetic field ensure that our system exhibits a crossover between dyson s standard symmetry classes .",
    "the transmission eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of the matrix product @xmath8 . denoting the number of modes in a lead with @xmath4 ,",
    "the transmission matrix @xmath9 , describing the transmission from lead 2 to lead 1 , is an @xmath10 matrix with quaternion elements .",
    "it is submatrix of @xmath11 , the @xmath12 scattering matrix of the system : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an @xmath15 matrix defined by @xmath16 if @xmath17 and @xmath18 otherwise , @xmath19 is a @xmath20 matrix with @xmath21 if @xmath22 and @xmath18 otherwise .",
    "the product @xmath8 has @xmath23 eigenvalues , where the factor two comes from the quaternion structure of the matrix elements .",
    "if the system is time reversal invariant , there are @xmath4 twofold degenerate levels .",
    "we assume that the system can be described with random matrix theory , i.e. @xmath24 @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath2 , where the magnetic time is related to the flux @xmath25 through the system as @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the flux quantum and @xmath28 is a numerical factor of order unity .    to give a statistical description of the crossover behaviour of the transmission eigenvalues",
    "we need an rmt model for the scattering matrix in the crossover regime .",
    "this is provided by the `` stub model '' @xcite which was adapted for the system under consideration in ref .  .",
    "in this approach the s matrix is represented as @xmath29 with @xmath30 in the above expression @xmath31 is an @xmath32 random unitary symmetric matrix taken from dyson s circular orthogonal ensemble@xcite ( coe ) and @xmath33 is a unitary matrix of size @xmath34 .",

    "the dimensionless parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 are related to the corresponding time scales as @xmath56 at the end of the calculation the limit @xmath57 should be taken .",
    "the density of transmission eigenvalues is defined as @xmath58 where the trace is taken over channel and spin indices .",
    "having @xmath59 at hand we can calculate the ensemble average of any linear statistics @xcite @xmath60 as @xmath61    prominent examples for linear statistics are the conductance , the shot noise power , or the cumulants of the distribution of transmitted charge @xcite .",
    "the weak localization correction for the linear statistics can be obtained from the weak localization correction to the transmission eigenvalue density .",
    "to find the density of transmission eigenvalues , one has to substitute the scattering matrix into the definition using , expand the inverses and calculate the average with the help of the diagrammatic technique of ref .",
    "up to subleading order in the small parameter @xmath62 .",
    "the details of the calculation can be found in appendix  [ app : details ] .",
    "the result is @xmath63    with the @xmath64 contribution @xmath65 we recover the known result of refs .  .",
    "the factor of two accounts for the spin , as a consequence of the known fact , that the @xmath64 term is insensitive to the spin - orbit interaction and the magnetic field .",
    "the main result of our paper is the closed - form , analytical expression for the weak localization correction to the density of transmission eigenvalues , @xmath66 for @xmath67 and @xmath18 otherwise .",

    "the factor of two in is due to the twofold degeneracy of transmission eigenvalues for @xmath84 , mentioned in sec [ sec : sysmod ] .",
    "to get some insight how the weak ( anti)localization peaks in emerge , let us have a closer look at @xmath85 as it approaches the different limits . for @xmath86 the expression for @xmath87 is well approximated by a lorentzian in the variable @xmath88 , @xmath89 in the opposite limit , @xmath90 , the functions @xmath71 become independent of @xmath91 . thus going to @xmath78 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 cancel , and @xmath94 , together with the inverse square root prefactor evolves to the peaks in at the edge of the spectrum .",
    "close to @xmath80 the correction vanishes .",
    "notice , that @xmath93 is independent of the spin - orbit coupling parameters .",
    "specially in zero magnetic field it always gives dirac delta contributions at @xmath95 and at @xmath96 .",
    "approaching @xmath82 , the contributions from @xmath94 , @xmath92 disappear , thus the zero magnetic field peaks associated with @xmath93 show up as the weak antilocalization correction .",
    "+    in the crossover regime the weak localization peaks in broaden , but the correction remains singular at the endpoints . if all the @xmath97-s are finite , the singularity is present through a inverse square root factor proportional to the @xmath64 contribution .",
    "the second , nonsingular factor in determines the form of the weak localization correction as the function of the magnetic field and spin - orbit coupling . in the absence of the magnetic field ( @xmath98 )",
    "this picture is modified by the inclusion of the remanent dirac delta contribution in place of the @xmath93 term . on fig .",
    "[ fig : drho ] we illustrated the transition from weak localization to weak antilocalization for two values of the magnetic field .",
    "the relevant regions are close to the endpoints , where the peaks of the pure symmetry cases are located . due to the antisymmetry of @xmath74 we plotted only the part around @xmath95 .",
    "the presence of spin - orbit coupling dependent and spin - orbit coupling independent contributions is analogous to the case of higher dimensional systems studied by nazarov @xcite , where they correspond to contributions coming from spin - triplet and spin - singlet cooperon modes .",
    "the situation is very similar in our case .",
    "the basic building block of the diagrammatic expansion for @xmath85 is the combination @xmath99 , with @xmath100 and @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes quaternion complex conjugation and the tensor product is defined with a backwards multiplication : @xmath103 the trace in the second term is understood as @xmath104 where latin letters are channel indices , greek letters refer to spin space and summation over repeated indices is implied .",
    "the very same structure emerges in the work of brouwer et .",
    "@xcite , where the authors identify @xmath105 as the equivalent of the cooperon in the conventional diagrammatic perturbation theory . in the limit",
    "@xmath106 it becomes : @xmath107 if according to the multiplication rule we define the action of a matrix on a vector as @xmath108 , the spin - singlet and spin - triplet basis turns out to be the eigenbasis of the matrix @xmath99 with eigenvalues @xmath109 as in ref .",
    ", only the triplet eigenvalues depend on the spin - orbit coupling strength .",
    "the correction can be expressed as @xmath110 where the function @xmath111 is @xmath112 the appearance of the spin - orbit coupling independent term is because of the decoupling of the singlet and triplet sectors of @xmath99 .",
    "going back to the discussion of the weak localization - weak antilocalization transition with in mind , we find that the weak localization peak is due to the triplet terms with eigenvalue @xmath113 , and the weak antilocalization peak comes from the singlet contribution .",
    "an other property of the higher dimensional cases that persists also for quantum dots is the breakdown of the perturbation theory for small magnetic fields near @xmath114 .",
    "more precisely , for fields @xmath115 the applicability condition @xmath116 of the perturbation theory is violated in an interval of order @xmath117 from the endpoints of the spectrum .",
    "the conclusion is the same as in ref .",
    ", namely , at small fluxes , for obtaining the detailed behaviour of the density near @xmath114 one has to treat the problem in a nonperturbative way .",
    "having obtained the @xmath118 , let us see some applications . in the following we assume zero temperature .",
    "first we compute the conductance .",
    "we find @xmath119 , \\end{array}\\label{eq : deltag}\\ ] ] where the second term represents the weak localization correction .",
    "it is another verification of , as we recover the corresponding result of brouwer et .",
    "al . in ref .  .",
    "note that the correction is of the form @xmath120 ( ref . ) .    as a second application we consider the shot noise power .",
    "we get @xmath121 that is , the @xmath122 contribution from @xmath74 is absent . in the case of pure symmetry classes",
    "it is a known result , that the weak localization correction to the shot noise power vanishes if the number of modes is the same in both leads @xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref .   that this persists to the case of a @xmath123 transition too .",
    "our result allows us to extend this prediction to the more general crossover interpolating between all of dyson s symmetry classes .",
    "the reason behind the absence of the @xmath122 contribution is that @xmath124 is symmetric with respect to the point and it is integrated with the antisymmetric density function @xmath85 .    to see an example , where the weak localization correction is absent in the limit of pure symmetry classes , but not in the crossover regime ,",
    "let us take the third cumulant of the distribution of the transmitted charge .",
    "it is the opposite of the shot noise in the sense , that for cavities with leads supporting the same number of channels the @xmath64 term vanishes @xcite , thus the leading order of this quantity is determined by @xmath125 .",
    "the third cumulant is proportional to @xmath126 the weak localization correction trivially vanishes in the pure symmetry case because of the factor @xmath124 and the dirac delta functions in . in the crossover regime",
    "we find @xmath127 that is , the ( ensemble average of the ) third cumulant is `` crossover induced '' for a symmetric cavity .",
    "we investigated the crossover behaviour of the weak localization correction to the density of the transmission eigenvalues between dyson s three symmetry classes @xmath128 for a case of a chaotic cavity with symmetric leads . using the stub model approach for the rmt description , with the help of the diagrammatic method of brouwer and beenakker @xcite",

    "we studied the weak localization - weak antilocalization transition in detail .",
    "we found that the weak localization peaks of the case of pure symmetry classes broaden in the crossover regime , but the correction still remains singular at the endpoint of the spectrum . with our result at hand",
    ", we gave a quantitative description of the broadening and the crossover from localization to antilocalization as the function of the magnetic field and spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we compared our results to the known cases of higher dimensionalities , and found strong similarities .",
    "first , our result also splits into spin - singlet and spin - triplet parts , with only the triplet contribution depending on the spin - orbit coupling . in the limits of pure symmetry classes ,",
    "the weak localization peak comes from the triplet contribution , while the antilocalization peak is due to the singlet part .",
    "second , we also find that for small magnetic fields , the perturbation theory fails to describe the details of the density near the endpoints of the transmission eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "we applied our results to the conductance , the shot noise power and the third cumulant of the distribution of the transmitted charge .",
    "the conductance served as a test for our calculations , we recovered the result of ref .",
    "obtained in the framework of the same model .",
    "for the shot noise power we found that the weak localization correction is absent in the full crossover , due to the symmetry of the transmission eigenvalue density .",
    "for the third cumulant we found opposite behaviour .",
    "it is crossover induced : the @xmath64 term is absent , and the @xmath122 contribution is nonzero only in the crossover regime .",
    "further directions of research could be to apply our result to obtain the weak localization correction to the full statistics of the transmitted charge .",
    "another possibility would be to extend our calculations to the case of cavities with asymmetric leads . in that case , differently from the present results , we expect a nontrivial magnetic field and spin - orbit coupling dependence also for the shot noise power .",
