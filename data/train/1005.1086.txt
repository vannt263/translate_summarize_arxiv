    "total positivity is a remarkably widespread phenomenon : matrices with positive / nonnegative minors play an important role in classical mechanics ( theory of small oscillations ) , probability ( one - dimensional diffusion processes ) , discrete potential theory ( planar resistor networks ) , asymptotic representation theory ( the edrei - thoma theorem ) , algebraic and enumerative combinatorics ( immanants , lattice paths ) , and of course in linear algebra and its applications .",

    ", nonnegative ) matrices in @xmath3 form a multiplicative semigroup , denoted by @xmath4 . in view of cryer s lemma",
    ", the study of @xmath4 can be reduced to the investigation of its subsemigroup @xmath5 of upper - triangular unipotent totally nonnegative matrices .",
    "the celebrated loewner - whitney theorem @xcite identifies the infinitesimal generators of @xmath6 as the _ chevalley generators _ of the corresponding lie algebra . in pedestrian terms , each upper - triangular unipotent totally nonnegative @xmath1 matrix can be written as a product of ( totally nonnegative ) matrices of the form @xmath7;\\ ] ] here the matrix @xmath8 differs from the identity matrix by a single entry @xmath9 in row @xmath10 and column  @xmath11 .",

    "( at @xmath15 ) .",
    "this set is infinite , and very hard to understand ; fortunately , it can be replaced  @xcite by a much simpler ( and finite ) set of _ generalized minors _  @xcite .",
    "a yet more general ( if informal ) concept is one of a _ totally positive / nonnegative variety_. vaguely , the idea is this : take a complex variety  @xmath16 together with a family @xmath17 of `` important '' regular functions on  @xmath16 . the corresponding totally positive ( resp . ,",
    "totally nonnegative ) variety @xmath18 ( resp . , @xmath19 )",

    ", nonnegative ) grassmannian _ consisting of the points in a usual grassmann manifold where all plcker coordinates can be chosen to be positive ( resp . ,",

    "the notion of positivity depends on a particular choice of a coordinate system : a basis in a vector space allows us to view linear transformations as matrices ; a choice of reference flag determines a system of plcker coordinates ; and so on .",
    "why study totally nonnegative varieties ?",
    "besides the connections to lie theory alluded to above , there are at least three more reasons .    first , some totally nonnegative varieties are interesting in their own right as they can be identified with important spaces , e.g.  some of those arising in teichmller theory ; cf",
    ".  section  [ sec : teich ] .",
    "one can hope to gain additional insight into the structure of such spaces and their compactifications by `` upgrading '' them to complex varieties , studying associated quantizations , etc .",
    "the nascent `` higher teichmller theory '' @xcite is one prominent expression of this paradigm .",
    "second , passing from a complex variety to its positive part can be viewed as a step towards its _",
    "tropicalization_. the deep connections between total positivity , tropical geometry , and cluster theory lie outside the scope of this short paper ; see @xcite for some aspects of this emerging research area .",
    "yet another reason to study totally nonnegative varieties lies in the fact that their structure as semialgebraic sets reveals important features of related complex varieties .",
    "we illustrate this phenomenon using the example first studied in  @xcite ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) .",
    "consider @xmath23 , the subgroup of @xmath24 unipotent upper - triangular matrices .",
    "the corresponding totally nonnegative variety is the semigroup @xmath6 of totally nonnegative matrices in  @xmath25 .",
    "take @xmath26 ; then @xmath27 : \\begin{array}{l } x\\ge0\\\\ y\\ge0\\\\ z\\ge0 \\end{array } \\",
    "\\text{and}\\ \\ xz - y\\ge0 \\right\\}.\\ ] ] the inequalities defining @xmath6 are homogeneous in the following sense : replacing @xmath28 by @xmath29 , with @xmath30 , does not change them . consequently , the space @xmath6 is topologically a cone with the apex @xmath31 ( the identity matrix ) over the base @xmath32 cut out by the plane @xmath33 .",
    "thus @xmath34 is the subset of the coordinate plane @xmath35 bounded by the @xmath0 axis and the parabola @xmath36 , as shown in figure  [ fig : digon](a ) .",

    "the adjacency of these strata is described by a partial order isomorphic  to the _ bruhat order _ on the symmetric group  @xmath45 .",
