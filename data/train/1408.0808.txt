    "the @xmath6 ( @xmath1 ) ( martin et al . 2005 ) has imaged the whole sky in the @xmath7 ( @xmath8 1350  1750  ) and @xmath2 ( @xmath8 1750  2750  ) wavebands , opening the door to studying variable stars in the ultraviolet",
    ". one of the most important classes of variable stars are rr lyraes , evolved horizontal branch stars that have intrinsic luminosities that correlate with pulsation amplitude and period .",
    "@xmath0  scuti  stars ( dsct amplitudes in the range 0.03 to 0.90 mag .",
    "; those with @xmath3 amplitudes greater than 0.20 are often called high amplitude @xmath0  scuti  stars . ] ) are a different class of pulsators with colors and pulsation periods comparable to rr lyraes ; they are discussed in the appendix ( sec . a ) .",
    "importantly , the ultraviolet ( @xmath9 ) amplitudes of rr lyrae stars are much larger in @xmath1 wavebands than in optical wavebands ( wheatley et al . 2003 ) .",
    "what remains unexplored are complete samples of @xmath9 variables .",
    "interestingly , detailed observations of several bright rr lyrae stars show that their @xmath9optical colors correlate with metallicity .",
    "wheatley et al . ( 2012 ) fit model light - curves to the @xmath7 and @xmath2 photomtery of six well - observed bright rr lyrae stars .",
    "they find that the @xmath7 and @xmath2 light - curves , which primarily reflect temperature changes during the pulsation cycle , also depend on metallicity .",
    "we also find that @xmath10 depends on metallicity .    to date ,",
    "candidate variable @xmath1 sources have been cataloged by welsh ( 2005 ) ( catalog 1 ) and by wheatley et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ( catalog 2 ) .",
    "during the course of this work , a third catalog of over a thousand variable @xmath1 sources was published by gezari et al .",
    "( 2013 ) ; this catalog exclusively uses @xmath2 magnitudes .",
    "few of these @xmath9 variables have optical identifications .",
    "only 25% of the 84 sources in catalog 1 and less than a third of the 410 sources in catalog 2 are matched to optical objects of known type .",
    "most of the @xmath9 variables with optical identifications are extragalactic objects . less than 10% of the @xmath9 variables in the catalog of gezari et al .",
    "( 2013 ) have identifications with known types of stars .",
    "the goal of this paper is to identify all of the galactic stars in the @xmath1 variable catalogs in a complete and systematic way , with a particular focus on rr lyrae variables .",
    "we investigate the @xmath4 color index as a possible diagnostic for identifying variable types : in sec .",
    "4.5 and appendix b , we address the problem of distinguishing between type c rr lyrae stars and contact binaries ( kinman & brown 2008 ) .",
    "we base our analysis on @xmath2 magnitudes , because @xmath2 magnitudes are more accurate than @xmath7 magnitudes and are available for a larger number of objects .",
    "the use of the @xmath11 color could provide additional constraint ( see for example , smith et al .",
    "2014 ) but would limit the sample .    our approach is to use the vizier search tool and the jaavs variable star catalog ( vsx , watson 2006 ) to identify known variables , such as those identified by drake et al .",
    "( 2012 ) in the catalina surveys , by palaversa et al .",
    "( 2013 ) in the linear survey , and by abbas et al .",
    "( 2014 ) in their search of the combined sdss , pan - starrs1 and catalina surveys .",
    "we look at every object in catalog 1 and in catalog 2 , and the subset of objects identified as `` stars '' in the larger gezari catalog . if we are unable to classify an object with the variable star catalogs , we then use data from the catalina survey data release 2 ( drake et al .",
    "2009 ) to measure the object s mean @xmath3 magnitude and , if possible , its variability .",
    "period - finding with the catalina survey data ( e.g. using the nasa exoplanet archive periodogram service ) becomes difficult for objects with @xmath3 @xmath12 17 and for objects with @xmath3 amplitudes @xmath130.2 magnitudes ; consequently , the types we assign to such variables are less certain .",
    "we also review the 38 objects previously identified as rr lyrae stars in the gezari catalog .",
    "this paper presents the rr lyrae and @xmath0  scuti  stars that we identify , and describes how @xmath1 magnitudes can assist in their identification .",
    "the @xmath14 color is particularly sensitive for detecting the temperature changes that come from pulsations , and for detecting the onset of this instability as a function of parameters such as t@xmath5 .",
    "the identification of other types of stars and variables from the @xmath1 variability catalogs will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "table 1 presents 110 rr lyrae and @xmath0  scuti  stars that we identify from the first two catalogs of @xmath1 variables ; these stars constitute 22% of all the sources in these catalogs .",
    "our list comprises 8 @xmath0  scuti  stars , 17 rrc  stars , 1 rrd star and 84 rrab  stars .",
    "references to the sources of the @xmath1 magnitudes and the optical data are given in columns 4 and 10 respectively .",
    "the @xmath4 colors given in col . 8 refer to mean magnitudes magnitude is the mean of the maximum and minimum values .",
    "the mean @xmath3 magnitude is the arithmetic mean of all the observations given by the catalina datarelease 2 . for brighter variables not in this survey ,",
    "the mean was estimated from the maximum and minimum magnitudes using the formula given in the appendix of preston et al .",
    "( 1991 ) . ] and their largest source of uncertainty lies in the estimation of the mean @xmath2 from the available data ; this uncertainty increases with the @xmath2 amplitude and is therefore largest for the rrab variables .",
    "we assumed the galactic extinction a@xmath15 = 8.90e@xmath16 ( rey et al .",
    "the e@xmath16 were taken from the mast archive of @xmath1 objects .",
    "only 6 stars have e@xmath16 @xmath12 0.100 so the uncertainty in the correction for extinction ( peek & schiminovich , 2013 ) is probably significant only for these stars .",
    "the periods given in column 9 are those taken from the literature in the case of previously known variables ; otherwise , the periods were determined by us .",
    "we discover 2 new @xmath0  scuti  stars , 3 rrc  stars and 10 rrab  stars among the 110 variable stars .",
    "we present the ephemerides of the new variables in table 2 , and plot their light curves in figures 1 , 2 , 3 & 4 .",
    "one of these rrc  and one of these rrab   were later found in the catalog of drake et al , ( 2014 ) but with differing periods ; these differences are discussed in sec .",
    "we investigate trends between @xmath14 color and stellar properties by studying a well - defined sample of known rr lyrae stars .",
    "we begin by calculating @xmath14 for 150 nearby rr lyrae stars using the recent compilation by dambis et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , a sample for which we could easily obtain the necessary data . for this sample , we plot @xmath14 against period for rrc and for @xmath17 and @xmath18 rrab ( fig 5 , upper panel ) , and against [ fe / h ] ( fig 5 , lower panel ) .",
    "there is a significant difference in @xmath14 between the rrc and rrab that reflects the average temperature difference between the two types .",
    "there is also a significant difference in @xmath14 between the @xmath18 and @xmath17 rrab that reflects the metallicity difference between the two types as expected from wheatley et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "we also investigate trends between the @xmath14 color and stellar properties for a sample of known high - amplitude @xmath0  scuti  stars ( hads ) taken from mcnamara ( 1997 ) and @xmath0  scuti   of lower amplitude taken from suveges et al .",
    "the results are shown in the plot of @xmath14 @xmath19 period given in fig .",
    "the blue open circles , black open triangles and black filled triangles are respectively the rrc ( both catalogs ) , rrab from catalog 1 and rrab from catalog 2 in table 1 .",
    "the horizontal solid blue , dotted black and dashed red lines show the mean values of @xmath14 for the rrc , halo rrab , and disk rrab respectively ; their associated vertical lines show the @xmath20 standard errors of these means .",
    "there is good agreement between these mean values and the @xmath14 of our program stars .",
    "the observed increase in this color with increasing period is nicely matched to the @xmath14 location of the blue edge of the instability gap ( kinman et al .",
    "2007 ) , shown by the heavy blue vertical line at a period of 0.2 days in fig . 6 .",

    "we begin by exploring the distribution of @xmath2 and @xmath3 pulsation amplitudes of the @xmath1 variables . for context , consider the five rrab variables with well - observed @xmath2 light curves from wheatley et al .",
    "the mean of the ratio of the @xmath2 amplitudes to the corresponding @xmath3 amplitudes ( taken from the literature ) for these five rrab stars is 2.15@xmath250.18 .",
    "the [ fe / h ] of these stars range from @xmath28 to @xmath29 ( mean @xmath30 ) , which means they are typical halo rr lyrae stars .    in figure 7",
    "we plot the @xmath2 amplitude @xmath19 the @xmath3 amplitude for the 84 rrab variables in table 1 .",
    "the variables from catalog 1 are plotted as open circles and those from catalog 2 by filled circles .",

    "lie above the line and 24 below ; 26 of the variables from catalog 2 lie above the line and 23 below .",
    "the catalog 1 variables lie preferentially below the line ( 5% level of significance ) while those from catalog 2 are more equally spaced .",
    "thus the @xmath2 amplitudes for the rrab derived from catalog 1 are on average lower than those from catalog 2 ; the latter are generally derived from more observations and approximate more closely to the true amplitudes .",
    "the scatter in fig .",
    "7 is large so that the correlation between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 amplitudes is not strong .",
    "it is clear , however , that on average the rrab @xmath2 amplitudes are twice as large as their @xmath3 amplitudes .",
    "next we explore the period - amplitude relation of the variables . in figure 8 we plot the distribution of @xmath31(period ) versus @xmath2 amplitudes ( left panel ) and @xmath3 amplitudes ( right panel ) . for reference ,",
    "the curve shows the relation for oosterhoff type i rrab variables observed in the globular cluster m3 ( cacciari et al .",
    "the curve refers to monoperiodic variables ; curves with secondary periods such as rrd or those with blazhko effect will have smaller amplitudes and lie below the line in this plot . in the right hand plot , the variables with periods shorter than 0.56 days ( @xmath31 p @xmath32 0.25 ) lie mainly below the curve ; those with longer periods lie increasingly above the curve with increasing period .",
    "we suspect that our @xmath3 amplitudes ( derived by visual inspection from light - curves largely derived from catalina survey data ( drake et al . , 2009 ) or in a few cases linear survey data ( sesar et al . , 2013",
    ") ) are systematically too small and that the admixture of higher amplitude variables with periods greater than 0.56 days comes from a population of oosterhoff type ii variables .",
    "the errors in the amplitudes are too great for a clean separation of the two types .",
    "a similar interpretation holds for the @xmath2 amplitudes in the left plot in fig .",

    "he finds 6 rrab with periods greater than 0.75 days and only 4 with periods greater than 0.80 days .",
    "none of these stars have amplitudes less than 0.50 mag . a new survey by abbas et al .",
    "( 2014 ) finds @xmath33 20 rrab with periods greater than 0.80 days .",
    "most of these stars have @xmath3 amplitudes between 0.4 and 0.6 magnitudes , and constitute about 0.03% of their total sample . here , we find two rrab with smaller amplitudes in this period range , the aforementioned j013642.0 - 062743.1 and j171251.8 + 185452.4 .",
    "these two rrab constitute @xmath33 2% of our sample , suggesting that the use of @xmath1 magnitudes ( where observed amplitudes are larger ) facilitates the discovery of such low ampltiude stars .      in the plot of @xmath4 against period , the hottest rr lyrae stars ( type rrc ) are coterminous with the blue horizontal branch stars at the blue edge of the instability gap .",
    "the stars near this blue edge are nearly all metal - poor ; thick disk blue horizontal branch stars are rare ( kinman et al . 2009 ) .",
    "we now consider the non - variable horizontal branch stars on the cool side of the instability gap : the red horizontal branch ( rhb ) stars . fig .",
    "9 plots @xmath34 against effective temperature ( t@xmath5 ) for these stars .",
    "the sources for the data in this plot are given in the appendix ( sec .",
    "we see that the hottest metal - poor rhb stars have @xmath4 colors similar to the halo rr lyrae stars . indeed , we find that some of the hottest metal - poor rhb candidates are actually rr lyrae stars .",
    "for t@xmath5 less than about 5200 k , most of these rhb stars are metal - rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath12 -0.8 ) and have larger @xmath4 than the metal - poor rhb , similar to the trend seen in the rrab stars .",
    "we do not find any metal - rich rhb stars hotter than this limit . as we discuss in appendix c , this is likely an observational selection effect ; there are few constraints on hot metal - rich rhb stars at fainter magnitudes ( @xmath3 @xmath12 10.5 ) .",
    "we can not rule out , however , that hot metal - rich rhb stars may be scarce in the field even though they are found in the metal - rich globular clusters like 47 tuc .",
    "the change in @xmath14 color with effective temperature is much larger compared with the change in optical color indices .",
    "stars like bd 18@xmath35 2757 and bps cs",
    "22875 - 029 have similar metallicity but differ in t@xmath5 by @xmath331250 k. their difference in @xmath36 and @xmath37 are 0.32 and 0.15 mag , respectively , while their difference in @xmath4 is over 2 mag .",
    "this makes the @xmath14 color particularly sensitive for detecting the temperature changes that come from pulsations and , in particular , for detecting the onset of this instability as a function of other parameters ( such as t@xmath5 ) .",
    "we explore the magnitude limits of our samples in figure 10 .",
    "10(a ) plots the distribution of the minimum @xmath3 magnitudes for the 84 rrab variables in table 1 .",

    "there is a steep fall - off at about @xmath15 = 21.0 .",
    "these two magnitude limits are consistent with the @xmath38 mag rrab colors observed by wheatley et al .",
    "( 2012 ) ; most of the rrab in table 1 are also in this range .",
    "a @xmath3=17.5 magnitude corresponds to a distance limit of about 25 kpc for our sample of rrab .",
    "most of the stars in our sample are at a sufficiently high galactic latitude that the correction for interstellar extinction is small , e@xmath16 @xmath32 0.04 for which e@xmath39 @xmath32 0.23 .",
    "the mean @xmath10 for rrc is somewhat smaller than that of the rrab , and they have lower amplitudes .",
    "consequently , rrc stars will have a fainter @xmath3 magnitude for a given @xmath2 , and their identification will necessarily be less complete than for the rrab .",
    "the @xmath2 light curve minima in the gezari catalog are all fainter than 20.0 and so , neglecting extinction , the rrc will have @xmath3 @xmath12 17 and will generally be less easy to detect with existing optical data without the use of new techniques .",
    "the 17 rrc and 48 rrab corresponds to @xmath330.40 variables per square degree for catalog 2 .",
    "this is comparable to the 0.455 rr lyrae per square degree found by abbas et al .",
    "( 2014 ) in a survey of somewhat greater depth ( 28 kpc ) and which they find has a completeness of @xmath3350% .",
    "this suggests that @xmath1 has detected only half of the rrab to @xmath3=17.5 , or else catalog 2 is itself only about half complete for these variables .",
    "catalog 2 contains the variables whose @xmath2 amplitudes are greater or equal to 0.6 mag .",

    "it is unlikely to be caused by a spread in metallicity because the range of metallicity in these objects is small ( rucinski et al .",

    "the @xmath2 pulsation amplitude of rr lyrae stars is roughly twice that of their @xmath3 amplitude ( as found earlier by wheatley et al .",
    "( 2012 ) ) .",
    "this allows us to detect low - amplitude variables such as j013642.0 - 062743.1 and j171251.8 + 185452.4 which have @xmath3 amplitudes of 0.25 and 0.38 mag , respectively .",

    "the overall completeness of catalog 2 is similar to that of the catalog of abbas et al .",
    "( 2014 ) which they estimate as 50% .",
    "the completeness of catalog 2 varies from field to field depending on the number of observations made per field .",
    "@xmath4 is more sensitive than optical colors to changes in t@xmath5 ( such as those that occur in stellar pulsation ) .",
    "four stars that have been described in the literature as rhb stars are actually rr lyrae stars ( e.g. bps cs 22940 - 070 which is called non - variable by for et al . , ( 2010 ) ) .",
    "a plot of @xmath4 against t@xmath5 shows that the metal - poor rhb stars merge into the rr lyraes at t@xmath5 @xmath33 6000 k which agrees with other estimates of the red edge of the instability gap .",

    "( 2012 ) do not show any metal - rich ( disk ) rhb stars hotter than t@xmath5 @xmath33 5200 k whereas such stars are known in the metal - rich globular cluster 47 tuc .",
    "we suggest that hotter metal - rich rhb stars could be found by deeper surveys .",
    "we find a large range in both @xmath4 and @xmath43 colors in a sample of bright contact binaries that have twice the periods of rrc stars and which may therefore be confused with them .",
