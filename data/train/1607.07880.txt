    "@xcite . from these decays",
    "we can deduce the observables : the two - body decay @xmath61 is sensitive to @xmath62 since the flavor of the charged lepton implies that the sterile neutrino must have mixed into a muon neutrino leading to the considered final decay ( a similar argument holds for the decay @xmath63 , which is sensitive to @xmath64 ) .",
    "the decay @xmath65 is sensitive to the total mixing @xmath39 because ship consider the light neutrino as missing energy , meaning that the flavor is not measured .",

    "specifically , one can measure the z - boson partial decay width @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the sm decay rate of a z - boson into two light neutrinos and @xmath69 is the mass of the sterile neutrino .",
    "it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ equ : zboson ] ) that the fcc experiment is only sensitive to the total mixing @xmath39 at the z - pole . if the center - of - mass energy is increased to @xmath70  gev .",
    "however , these measurements are less sensitive than fcc on the total mixing .",
    "we therefore disregard them since the individual mixing elements can not violate the bound on the total mixing  @xcite .",
    "] there are different experimental channels to be investigate at lepton colliders ; here we mention the two most promising ones .",

    ", kinematical cuts and selecting two leptons with the same electric charge can reduce the background . since the two outgoing leptons have the same sign , the process is lepton number violating and sensitive to the majorana nature of the neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity to the active - sterile mixing of the experiments has been studied under different assumptions for the ratios among the flavor - dependent mixings which makes it possible for the ship and dune collaborations to translate a bound on the individual mixing element into a bound on the total mixing .",
    "the fcc collaboration only considers the total mixing ; therefore no assumption of that kind is needed in their study .",
    "the ship collaboration obtained their sensitivity to the _ total _ active - sterile mixing for five different scenarios with these assumptions  @xcite : @xmath73 where no ( io ) means normal ( inverted ) ordering of the light neutrinos .",
    "the first three scenarios imply that the sterile neutrinos predominantly mix with one flavor ( electron , muon or tau )  @xcite , whereas the last two scenarios are interesting to generate a sufficient amount of baryon asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "case  2 is ship s benchmark scenario , which means that the sensitivity to the total active - sterile mixing is calculated for this case only , whereas the sensitivity for the other cases has been obtained by extrapolating the sensitivity from case  2 by using the ratio among the individual mixing elements .",
    "the conclusions are derived from the decay @xmath74 .",
    "note , however , that the ship collaboration has also investigated the processes @xmath75 and @xmath76 individually .",
    "the dune collaboration estimated their sensitivity curve  @xcite for the total mixing by scaling experimental parameters , such as protons on target , number of produced charm mesons , detector length and detector area with the charm  @xcite and the ps191  @xcite experiments .",
    "this means that the sensitivity curve is extrapolated to the dune experiment .",
    "however , charm and ps191 have only reported sensitivity bounds of the individual mixing elements @xmath64 and @xmath62 , which means that dune s sensitivity curve is only valid when these individual mixing elements dominate the total mixing .",
    "therefore the underlying assumption in terms of flavor observables are similar to the ship experiment .",
    "several sensitivity bounds have been reported by each of the future experiments for changing the experiment parameters , such as detector length , running time and decay length .",

    "here two procedures are discussed which produce viable candidates for @xmath78 and @xmath79 leading to neutrino physics observables in the allowed parameter ranges .",
