    "we also retrieved the archival acs uv images from proposal 9470 with daniel kunth as pi which are described in @xcite .",
    "these were aligned with idp3 and utilized to better understand the morphology of sbs0335 - 052e at higher spatial resolution than the nicmos images or the previous wfpc2 images .",

    "the key elements to this study are the volume emission measure , @xmath22 , and the nature of the thermal radio emission .",
    "together they determine the nature of the stellar population and the state of the ionized gas in s1 and s2 . in",
    "what follows we will lump s1 and s2 together since they are unresolved in the nicmos image .",
    "we assign half of the emission to each source , and hence half of the volume emission measure , although a radio image from @xcite indicates that s1 is the stronger radio source .",
    "the error is at most a factor of two and does not affect the major conclusions of the paper .",
    "the optical and near infrared contour plots and the uv f149lp image are shown in figure  [ fig - src ] in the orientation of the original wfpc2 images .",
    "the dominant pa @xmath0 emission is clearly centered on s1 and s2 with some emission also at s3 .",

    "we next use the pa @xmath0 image to determine the volume emission measure for s1 and s2 which in turn is a direct measure of the ionizing flux . @xcite",
    "measured the br @xmath23 and br @xmath0 flux in a 1.5 by 1 arc second region centered on s1 and s2 that does not include any of the emission from s3 .",
    "the measured pa @xmath0 flux in this region is @xmath24 ergs s@xmath17 @xmath10 after subtraction of flux from an aperture of equal area off the source to eliminate any contribution due to diffuse emission .",
    "the observed @xmath25 ratio @xcite predicts an a@xmath26 value of @xmath27 using the extinction law of @xcite which is very similar to the value of 12.2 found by @xcite using another extinction law .",
    "this in turn predicts an extinction of 1.64 magnitudes at pa @xmath0 which gives an extinction corrected pa @xmath0 flux of @xmath28 ergs s@xmath17 @xmath10 for the 1 by 1.5 arc second region that contains s1 and s2 .",
    "here we have assumed that since s1+s2 is the brightest pa @xmath0 emitter , it is also probably the brightest br @xmath0 emitter as well and the measured extinction from @xmath25 is appropriate for correcting the pa @xmath0 emission of s1+s2 .",
    "@xcite find that the optical emission lines are best matched with an ionized gas temperature of 20,000 k which we will use in the rest of the analysis .",
    "an important question is whether the observed pa @xmath0 flux in this work is consistent with the br @xmath0 measurements in the context of normal case b recombination theory .",
    "the extinction at br @xmath0 from @xcite is 0.57 magnitudes which gives an extinction corrected br @xmath0 flux of @xmath29 ergs s@xmath17 and a pa @xmath0 to br @xmath0 ratio of 5.26 .",
    "the line ratios given in the appendix of @xcite show that the calculated ratio for 20,000 k is 4.22 . given the expected errors in fluxes and extinctions this is considered in reasonable agreement .",
    "note that if the pa @xmath0 to br @xmath0 ratio were affected by line optical depth effects we would expect that the observed ratio would be less than the calculated ratio since the population of the n=3 state of the hydrogen gas should be greater than the n=4 state .",
    "the numbers in this calculation are listed in table  [ tbl - paba ] .    a caveat to the calculated extinction",
    "should be mentioned .",
    "if the extinction derived from the infrared lines is extrapolated to the ultraviolet wavelength of the acs image , 1400 it should be on the order of 24 magnitudes .",
    "comparison of the predicted flux at 1400 from the starburst99 calculation described below indicates an extinction of approximately 8 magnitudes .",
    "this however follows an already observed trend in sbs0335 - 052e that the derived extinction decreases at shorter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the usual explanation is that only at longer wavelengths can you see into the regions of higher extinction . since we are concerned with the true pa @xmath0 flux we will use the extiction dervived directly from the infrared lines which is consistent in the ratios of pa @xmath0 br @xmath23 and br @xmath0 .",
    "the radio images of @xcite ( slide 10 ) confirm that there are no hidden ionization regions off the observed sources that could be the source of additional br @xmath0 flux that might contaminate the measurement .    using case b recombination theory    @xmath30    and the appendix from @xcite the volume emission measure to total pa @xmath0 power is given by    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is in ergs per second .",
    "for a 20,000 k ionized gas the observed pa @xmath0 for s1 only , assigning half of the s1+s2 emission measure to s1 , requires a volume emission measure ( n@xmath33 ) of @xmath34 @xmath35 which is equivalent to 16,000 o7 stars using the o7 star n@xmath33 value of @xmath36 from @xcite .",
    "use of the standard @xcite relation between the number of ionizing photons and the current star formation rate gives a rate of 2 m@xmath37 per year for s1 .",
    "our concentration on s1 here , rather than s1+s2 is slightly arbitrary since the pa @xmath0 image does not resolve the two sources .",
    "however , as will be seen later , s1 has a resolved radio spectrum , which is not available yet for s2 , and s1 has a resolved size from the acs uv image .",
    "s2 in this image is a diffuse object .",
    "we therefore concentrate on s1 as the source with the best determined physical parameters , and as mentioned earlier , changes by a factor of 2 in the s1 emission measure does not affect the conclusions of this paper .    although the absolute star formation rate of 2 m@xmath2 per year for s1 is not particularly high , the specific star formation rate , ssfr , the star formation rate divided by the stellar mass of @xmath38 m@xmath2 found below , is @xmath39 year@xmath17 , consistent with the enhanced ssfr of higher z galaxies from the plots in @xcite .",
    "they find that the ssfr increases with redshift out to their maximum redshift of 1.5 indicating higher star formation rates per unit mass by two orders of magnitude at z = 1.5 than today .",
    "this provides some evidence that the star formation in sbs0335 - 052 is similar to star formation at much earlier times .",
    "we used the online starburst99 code @xcite to determine the volume emission measure produced by a @xmath40 m@xmath2 stellar population with a salpeter imf in the mass range between 0.1 and 120 m@xmath2 . comparing the volume emission measure from the starburst99 output at 3 my to the measured value we determine that s1 contains a stellar mass of @xmath38 m@xmath2 .",
    "stars below 1 m@xmath2 are probably not yet on the main sequence but we assume that they are gravitationally bound protostars that contribute to the gravitational mass of the cluster . counting only stars above 1 m@xmath2 , the total formed mass is approximately @xmath41 m@xmath2 .",
    "the output of this same calculation determined that the actual number of o9 and earlier stars is approximately 7,500 .",
    "this is lower than the number of equivalent o7 stars since the presence of stars earlier than o7 increases the number of ionizing photons per unit mass .",

    "[ sss - ir ] .",
    "observations of the br @xmath23 line in obscured young stellar objects ( ysos ) in the 1980s indicated that the observed line flux for objects with luminosities less than that of an o9 zero age main sequence ( zams ) star were higher than predicted from the ly continuum emission expected from the star , eg .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) . at the same time",
    "the radio emission was far less than that from optically thin free - free emission with the same emission measure .",
    "the explanation of the line excess phenomenon was provided by @xcite who showed that a star with a significant wind will have a high density region which collisionally excites the n = 2 level of hydrogen .",
    "the excited atoms can then be ionized by balmer continuum photons which gives an excess line emission over the ionization expected from only lyman continuum photons . n@xmath33 as derived from the line emission is then no longer an accurate measure of the number of lyman continuum photons .",
    "the lack of radio emission was due to the high optical depth at radio frequencies .",
    "if the majority of ionizing photons are produced by stars earlier than o9 then the line excess effect is irrelevant in our calculations involving n@xmath33 .",
    "calculations of the ionizing flux for a stellar population with a salpeter imf and an upper mass cutoff of 120 m@xmath37 indicates that 98% of the ionizing flux comes from stars earlier than o9 , therefore the calculated value of n@xmath33 is suitable for determining the nature of the stellar population .",
    "the optically thin free - free emission is directly proportional to the volume emission measure by the thermal bremsstrahlung equation    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is in w m@xmath45 hz@xmath17 and all units are in the mks system @xcite . for radio frequencies",

    "[ eq - ff ] the z dependence has been dropped since the majority of the gas is hydrogen . at a distance of 53 mpc the value of the volume emission measure found in   [ s - vem ] from the pa @xmath0 flux of s1 , converted to m@xmath45 , predicts a thermal radio emission of 0.61 mjy at 10 ghz for an ionized gas temperature of 20,000 k which is a factor of 4 above the flux observed by @xcite ( slide 8) of 0.15 mjy at 10 ghz for s1 only . the synchrotron flux observed by @xcite for s1 + s2 is not present in the @xcite spectrum , indicating that it is probably associated with s2 or other regions outside s1 .    instead of the expected @xmath48 decrease in radio flux with frequency spectrum of optically thin free - free emission",
    "the observed radio spectrum has a roughly @xmath49 rising spectrum .",
    "this , coupled with the factor of 4 less emission than predicted from the emission measure , indicates that the radio emission has a significant optically thick component .",
    "the radio emission probably comes from a complex geometry of varying optical depths and perhaps temperatures but observations of galactic hii regions which surround the ionizing star @xcite suggests a very simplified model of 7500 o stars with winds that produce hii regions of high enough density that the stromgren spheres are confined to areas close to the star .",
    "we can use the simplified models of @xcite as a guide .",
    "@xcite showed that for a density structure of @xmath50 around a star the frequency dependence of the optically thick radio emission is @xmath51 where @xmath52 . the unhindered free expansion wind with @xmath53 gives a roughly @xmath54 spectrum .",
    "the value of @xmath55 for @xmath56 is 1.72 which is appropriate for a wind that is not allowed to freely expand but is hindered by the surrounding medium .",
    "the flux at a frequency @xmath57 is given by    @xmath58    where d is the distance to the object and r is the r in the density equation .",
    "the optical depth @xmath59 is given by    @xmath60    and the emissivity f in @xmath61 is given by    @xmath62    for olnon s model iv .",
    "distributing the observed flux equally among 7,500 stars and matching the observed flux at 10 ghz gives the following parameters for the hii regions around each star .",
    "the electron density at r is @xmath63 and r is @xmath64 pc or 433 au for a temperature of 20,000 k. the optical depth at r is 9.7 , justifying the assumption of optically thick emission .",
    "as is well known , olnon s model iv is not valid for @xmath65 since an integration of the density law leads to an infinite mass .",
    "the density law must be truncated at some radius as is done for @xmath53 in olnon s model v. the solutions are not given for other q values but the general nature is that they are basically model iv in the optically thick regions and the normal free - free spectrum in the optically thin regions , therefore use of model iv in this frequency range is justified and real stars will have truncated flows when the pressure of the interstellar medium halts the wind .",
    "the parameters described above are typical of hyper compact hii regions . if 2r is taken as a characteristic size of the ionized regions then the total volume occupied by the ionized gas is only @xmath66 pc@xmath67 which is a filling factor of less than @xmath68 for a 3 pc cluster radius .",
    "this is justification for our assumption that the hii regions are confined to the stars themselves .",
    "the average distance between the 15,000 o stars in the cluster is about 0.1 pc , much greater than the size of the hii regions .",
    "note that integration of the density equation out to 1.9 r accounts for the volume emission measure calculated from the pa @xmath0 emission .",
    "in reality it is probable that although the majority of o stars may have confined hii regions , that some of the hii regions have broken out and that some ionizing uv emission is present throughout the cluster , producing a background optically thin component of emission .",
    "obviously the stars in s1 will have differing density structures and the structure we have used here is a representative average .",
    "the variations in structure will produce bumps and wiggles in the radio spectrum as is observed in the spectrum of @xcite .",
    "it also should be emphasized that the model developed here is not the only possible geometry of the ionized gas that will account for the line and radio emission .",
    "it is , however , motivated by observations in our own galaxy of young stars with winds that limit the ionized area to a small region centered on the star .      although not critical to our discussion of feedback in sbs0335 - 052e , we address two other known emission components for completeness and to show that neither component has a significant effect on the galaxy at the present time",
    ". the x - ray emission component could conceivably have a significant role in the nature of the galaxy at a later time , however .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity for sbs0335 - 052e is approximately @xmath69 ergs per second @xcite depending on the spectral model used to fit the data .",
    "the emission is primarily from a point source although @xcite state that there is also evidence for faint extended emission with a luminosity of @xmath70 ergs per second .",
    "the temperature of the x - ray emitting gas is @xmath71 kev which is much hotter than the  1 ev gas responsible for the nebular continuum .",
    "for this temperature gas the volume emission measure , @xmath22 , required is @xmath72 @xmath35 which is more than 1000 times less than is required for the nebular emission ( see   [ s - vem ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the hot x - ray emitting gas is a minor component of the ionized gas in sbs0335 - 052e .",
    "@xcite indicate that the x - ray spectrum is relatively soft and consistent with either a cluster of high mass x - ray binaries or with an intermediate mass black hole .",
    "the thermal bremsstrahlung from the x - ray emitting gas is only @xmath73 jy at radio frequencies , therefore it does not contribute to the observed radio flux .",
    "one of the surprises of sbs0335 - 052e was the discovery of strong mid - infrared emission from dust in a galaxy that has very low metallicity ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "neither the iso image nor the spitzer peak up image @xcite have the spatial resolution to associate the infrared emission with a particular component or ssc , but it is consistent with being centered on s1-s2 .",
    "the simplest explanation is that infrared source is associated with s1 and s2 .",
    "this is also consistent with the ground based observations of @xcite which show that the br@xmath23 emission and the 12.5 @xmath4 emission are coincident to an accuracy of 0.5 .",
    "the high emission measure of s1 and s2 indicate that they are young and still have dust nearby if not in the clusters themselves .",
    "@xcite comment that the mid - ir spectrum is consistent with very hot dust which is another reason for associating the mid - ir emission with the young s1 and s2 sscs . the intrinsic luminosity of @xmath74 is sufficient to power the approximately @xmath75 @xcite mid infrared luminosity .",
    "in fact with an a@xmath26 value of 12 there should be a three times higher mid - infrared luminosity than that observed if the dust causing the extinction is located close to s1 .",
    "given our model of sources with strong winds it is probable that the dust geometry is quite complex and that there may not be high dust obscuration over a full @xmath76 steradians , allowing a large fraction of luminosity to escape in directions other than along our line of sight to the sources .",
    "it is very probable that there is little , if any , dust in the strong wind , ultra - compact hii regions surrounding the stars .",
    "one of the critical missing elements in our ability to model the formation , growth , and evolution of galaxies is a good understanding of how the initial star formation affects , or feedbacks on , subsequent star formation .",
    "sbs0335 - 052e affords an opportunity to observe the process at reasonably high resolution under conditions similar to star formation at very high redshift .",
    "there are several qualitative clues and a few quantitative ones that can be identified .",
    "there is significant evidence as discussed by @xcite and now with the increase of pa@xmath0 emission toward the southern clusters that there is a progression of apparent ages , starting with the supernova cavity in the northeast , ending with the obviously young s1 and s2 in southwest .",
    "this suggests that each episode of star formation has positive feedback on subsequent star formation .",
    "the lack of a significant population of stars in the supernova cavity suggests that the very first star formation episode ended very quickly , blowing out the area but producing compression of the gas that lead to star formation at s6 , s5 and s4 .",
    "these then induced star formation at s3 and subsequently at s1 and s2 .",
    "more qualitative evidence of positive , or at least nondestructive feed back is the double source , s3 .",
    "the two clusters are separated on the sky by only 26 pc and are therefore almost certainly associated . that two clusters can form stars in such close proximity is strong evidence that adjacent star forming areas do not produce strong negative feedback .",
    "although not as intense as s1+s2 , s3 has detectable pa@xmath0 emission indicating current star formation .",
    "it is not possible to determine which of the clusters , or perhaps both , is the source of the star formation .",
    "the exact nature of the clusters is not critical , but rather that two clusters can form in close proximity , regardless of the sequence , is evidence that the presence of large scale star formation does not necessarily terminate other star formation in the immediate environment .",
    "it is unfortunate that we can not observe this system at much higher resolution to see the dynamical interaction between two closely paired clusters .    the simple existence of sscs , which have thousands of o stars within a radius of only a few parsecs , sets severe limits on the negative feedback from massive star formation .",
    "the formation of the first massive stars does not prevent the subsequent formation of thousands of more massive stars at average distances of far less than a pc from the first stars .",
    "in fact this is a motivating consideration in the construction of our model system to see if there is a plausible model that matches the observed parameters and that allows the formation of such a cluster . since a large fraction of stars",
    "may have formed in clusters this has important implications on theories of galaxy evolution .",
    "if our model of individual hii regions surrounding the o stars is even approximately correct it says that the volume of ionized gas in at least s1 is quite small compared to the volume of the cluster .",
    "this invokes a scenario that most of the luminous stars are losing mass through stellar winds and the ionizing photons of the stars are expended within a few 100 au from the stars due to the high densities created by the winds .",
    "this quenches any negative feedback due to the photoionization of neutral gas .",
    "other than through winds and gravity these stars have very little effect on their environments outside of their hii regions .",
    "as long as these winds continue , photoionization will not play a role in feedback on the galaxy as a whole .",
    "it is important to note here that the boundaries of the hii regions are simply where the ionizing photons are depleted and do not necessarily mark any boundary for the gas outflow .    although the effects of photoionization can be accurately mapped through emission line images and radio emission maps , the effects of stellar winds are less easily measured .",
    "work by @xcite indicated that massive and concentrated star clusters should produce a strong stationary superwind at all times in their evolution .",
    "this would remove gas from the cluster and affect the surrounding region through shocks and density enhancement .",
    "recent work by @xcite , however , indicates that many outflows around hii regions created by young stellar clusters are `` stalled '' by the ambient interstellar medium . in this case , however , the individual stellar hii regions appear to be stalled by the intercluster gas .",
    "this may be a phase that further delays the onset of feedback at the cluster level .",
    "@xcite note that it is mainly the pressure that controls the expansion of the hii regions .",
    "the low star to gas mass ratio and the large gas mass of sbs0335 - 052 may contribute to stalling out the expansion of the stellar hii regions .",
    "the future evolution of the sscs and of sbs0335 - 052 itself is of great interest .",
    "sbs0335 - 052w has an even lower metallicity than the eastern component but with a higher x - ray luminosity ( @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it appears that the western component has not yet had a major episode of star formation .",
    "as suggested by @xcite , the star formation in the eastern component was probably triggered by interactions , either between the eastern and western component or with ngc 1376 .",
    "since the two components share a common hi cloud it appears likely that it was the interaction with ngc 1376 that triggered the formation of the sscs .",
    "the large amount of neutral gas , @xmath77 m@xmath2 , shows that there is adequate mass for further star formation in both components .",
    "based on only the radial component of the velocity difference between sbs0335 - 052 and ngc 1376 , they are gravitationally bound to each other .",
    "it would appear that the eventual fate of sbs0335 - 052 is to merge with the much larger ngc 1376 in what in hierarchical galaxy assembly would be called a minor merger . in",
    "most galaxy merging simulations significant star formation occurs after the first encounter which would mean that sbs0335 - 052 has already had its first encounter with ngc 1376 and may have been significantly closer to it in the past .",
    "the current sscs in sbs0335 - 052e will evolve on a much shorter time scale than the sbs0335 - 052/ngc 1376 system . according the stellar populations calculated by starburst99",
    "there are more than 2500 stars in the s1 ssc with more than 30 m@xmath2 .",
    "these stars should end up as black holes at the end of their evolution .",
    "although many of the black holes may be ejected from the cluster due to supernova kicks , there exists the possibility of having several thousand black holes within the 3 pc radius of the cluster .",
    "this proximity may lead to mergers which could form an intermediate mass black hole , consistent with the x - ray emission from the region .",
    "an alternative scenario is presented by @xcite who modeled the cluster mgg 11 in m82 .",
    "they calculated that the dynamical time for a 100 m@xmath2 star to sink to the center of the cluster was 3 myr which led to several collisions and the formation of a 800 - 3000 m@xmath2 star which then led directly to the creation of an intermediate mass black hole without significant mass loss .",
    "although the radius of s1 is about twice that of mgg 11 it has about 10 times more mass leading to a similar dynamical sink time from equation 1 of @xcite . in either scenario",
    "super star clusters may be the birthplace of intermediate mass black holes that can be the seeds of the massive black holes that power agns .",
    "the lack of x - ray emission from the other sources in sbs0335 - 052 indicate that this process did not occur in those sources , however , we do not currently have detailed information on their stellar density in the formation epoch equivalent to the current epoch of s1 and s2 .",
    "the pa @xmath0 flux from the s1 ssc provides a determination of the volume emission measure which when compared to the observed radio emission indicates that much of the radio emission occurs at high to moderate optical depth and high density .",
    "a simple model which divides the volume emission measure equally among the 7500 o stars predicted from starburst99 and using radio emission models of @xcite indicates a very low filling factor for the ionized gas , consistent with the assumption of individual hii regions .",
    "the confinement of the ionizing flux to regions of only a few hundred au around individual stars limits and delays the effect of photoionization of neutral gas and molecular clouds .",
    "this provides a consistent picture of how several thousand o stars can form within a radius of 3 pc and may be indicative of star formation at early times in the universe . although indicating very little negative feedback at the current time , sbs0335 - 052 has a very low star to gas mass ratio . as that ratio increases and the gas mass decreases the confining pressure of the interstellar medium may decrease to a level where the hii regions are no longer stalled at small radii and begin to produce negative star formation feedback on the galaxy as a whole .",
    "finally we address the evolution of both the complex and the sscs indicating that sbs0335 - 052 may be part of a minor merger with ncc 1376 and speculating that s1 and sscs in general may be the birthplace of intermediate mass black holes .",
    "this work contains data from the nasa / esa hubble space telescope which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy ( aura ) inc . under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 .",

    "<S> the wind density can be high enough to absorb the majority of ionizing photons within less than 1000 au of the stars , creating very compact hii regions that emit optically thick radiation at radio wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> these winds would then effectively quench the photoionizing flux very close to the stars . this can delay the onset of negative feedback by photoionization and photodissociation on star formation in the clusters . </S>",
    "<S> this is significant since sbs0335 - 052e resembles the conditions that were probably common for high redshift star formation in galaxies near the epoch of reionization . </S>"
