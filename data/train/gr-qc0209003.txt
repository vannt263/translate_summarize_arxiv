    "the brane world scenario is paid much attention in the context of the unified theory of elementary particles .",
    "this scenario regards our space as the 3-brane with large extra dimensions on which gauge particles and interactions are confined . in this scenario ,",
    "the planck energy can be at the @xmath3 scale  @xcite .",
    "one of the consequences of lowering the planck scale is that the properties of a small black hole whose radius is smaller than the size of the extra dimensions are substantially altered ; the black holes is well - described as a @xmath0-dimensional black hole centered on the brane , but extending out into the @xmath4-dimensional extra space and the radius of such a black hole is @xmath5 times larger than that of the usual black hole with the same mass .",
    "hence it becomes much easier to produce black holes using a future planned accelerator such as the cern large hadron collider and this possibility has been discussed by many authors  @xcite .    the possibility of producing black holes by the collision of particles can be estimated by using the hoop conjecture  @xcite , which states that an apparent horizon forms when and only when the mass @xmath6 of the system gets compacted into a region whose circumference @xmath7 satisfies @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the schwarzschild horizon radius for the mass @xmath6 .",
    "if we assume that the inequality give the condition for black hole formation in the higher - dimensional gravity , we can evaluate the impact parameter @xmath10 of the colliding particles which leads to black hole production .",
    "the circumference that surrounds two particles at the instant of collision is @xmath11 . by setting @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the center of mass energy of the system ,",
    "the maximal impact parameter @xmath14 that leads to the black hole formation becomes @xmath15 . by introducing a numerical factor @xmath16 close to unity ,",
    "the total cross section for black hole production is written as the following form : @xmath17 obtaining @xmath16 is necessary to improve experimental predictions of the black hole production in collider physics and observations of ultra - high energy cosmic rays .    in our previous paper",
    "@xcite , we investigated the black hole formation in high - energy head - on collisions of particles in the @xmath0-dimensional gravity and found that @xmath18 becomes a parameter to judge the existence of the apparent horizon for all @xmath0 .",
    "although this implies that the hoop conjecture holds for this system , we do not know the condition for the horizon formation in the higher - dimensional spacetime .",
    "recently , ida and nakao  @xcite investigated momentarily static initial data in the five - dimensional spacetime and found that a spindle distribution of matter can lead to the black hole formation even if the hoop @xmath7 is arbitrarily larger than @xmath19 .",
    "this provides a counter example for `` only when '' part of the hoop conjecture .",
    "they showed that the isoperimetric inequality @xmath20 is satisfied on the horizon and conjectured that for a characteristic @xmath2-dimensional volume @xmath21 of the system , the inequality @xmath22 would become a condition for the horizon formation in the @xmath0-dimensional spacetime with the gravitational constant @xmath23 .",
    "this `` @xmath2-volume conjecture''(volume conjecture ) is one candidate that provides a better condition for the horizon formation in the higher - dimensional spacetime than the hoop conjecture and it is worth investigating .    in this paper , we consider the grazing collisions of particles in the @xmath0-dimensional einstein gravity and investigate the formation of apparent horizons .",
    "eardley and giddings  @xcite developed a method of finding apparent horizons for this system .",
    "the problem was reduced to a boundary - value problem for a poisson s equation in a @xmath24-dimensional flat space and they solved it analytically for @xmath25 case .",
    "we solve this problem numerically for @xmath26 and obtain the maximal impact parameter @xmath14 for black hole formation and the factor @xmath16 in eq . .",
    "then using these solutions , we discuss the condition of horizon formation for this system from the view point of the hoop conjecture and the volume conjecture .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly review the method of finding apparent horizons in the system of the grazing collision of particles . in section iii",
    ", we present our numerical results and discuss the two conjectures for this system .",
    "section iv is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "to simplify the situation , we consider black holes with horizon radius smaller than the size of extra dimensions .",
    "this enables us to ignore the effect of the brane tension and the geometry of the extra dimensions .",
    "the metric with a high - energy point particle is obtained by infinitely boosting a schwarzschild black hole with fixed total energy @xmath27 .",
    "the resulting system becomes a massless point particle accompanied by a plane - fronted gravitational shock wave which is the lorentz - contracted longitudinal gravitational field of the particle .",
    "combining two shock waves , we can set up the collision of high - energy two particles moving in @xmath28 direction .",
    "this system was originally developed by death and payne  @xcite and recently analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "the metric of this system outside the future light cone of the colliding shocks is given as @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the heviside step function and @xmath33 is the point in flat @xmath24-space @xmath34 that is transverse to the direction of particle motion .",
    "the function @xmath35 depends only on @xmath36 and takes the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the volume of a unit @xmath2-sphere and @xmath39 denote the points of two particles in @xmath24-dimensional space and we take @xmath40 the apparent horizon @xmath41 is defined as a closed spacelike @xmath24-surface on which the outer null geodesic congruence has zero convergence .",

    "the black hole is produced when the impact parameter @xmath10 satisfies the condition @xmath160 .",
    "this condition can be derived by using the volume conjecture and suggests that the volume conjecture provides a better condition for horizon formation than the hoop conjecture in the higher - dimensional gravity .",
    "we evaluated the value of @xmath18 and @xmath130 on the apparent horizon and both inequalities @xmath161 and @xmath162 give fairly good conditions for the horizon formation .",

    "but in the system with two point particles , the gravitational field in the middle of two particles is weak if the distance of two particles are larger than @xmath9 and becomes sufficiently strong to form the horizon if the distance of two particles equals to @xmath9 for any @xmath0 .",
    "this leads to the condition of the black hole formation @xmath165 .",
    "we therefore expect that the hoop conjecture in the higher - dimensional spacetime holds for the system that consists of two point particles .",
    "the behavior of @xmath148 indicates that @xmath162 with the quasilocal mass provides the better condition for the horizon formation compared to the hoop conjecture .",

    "there remains the possibility that even if the apparent horizon does not exist , there is a surface that satisfies the @xmath166 .",
