    "damped ly@xmath3 quasar absorption line systems are commonly believed to trace a population of objects which may be the progenitors of modern galaxies ( e.g. wolfe 1990 ) .",

    "the problem such searches face is that without high resolution and high signal - to - noise ratio spectra , the molecular hydrogen lines are blended with the ly@xmath3forest lines . further , quasar absorption line studies usually concentrate on bright blue quasars , so lines of sight with substantial reddening and large molecular fraction are probably selected against ( ostriker & heisler , 1984 ; fall & pei 1993 ) .",
    "so far , there is only one detection of h@xmath2 absorption in the z = 2.811 damped ly@xmath3  absorber toward psk 0528@xmath0250 , which shows moderate h@xmath2 absorption with total column density n(h@xmath2 )",

    "an exposure of a he - ne - ar - cu lamp was done before and after each exposure of the object to provide an accurate wavelength reference , and a measure of the spectral resolution .",
    "several quartz lamp exposures were taken at the beginning and end of the nights to provide a flat - field correction .",
    "we also observed standard stars before and after the qso observations to monitor possible atmospheric absorption .",
    "the data were reduced in the standard way using iraf .",
    "the he - ne - ar - cu spectra were extracted with the same procedure and a first order spline3 function fit was used to obtain a wavelength calibration .",

    "a very strong peak with the correlation amplitude of 0.66 is noted near zero velocity shift .",
    "the other two second strong peaks at @xmath23 4,300 km  s@xmath7  are caused by shifting the spectra by one band separation ( @xmath14 47   in the observed frame , e.g. morton & dinerstein , 1976 ) . if the regions in the spectrum around the four identified strong ly@xmath3  and metal lines , as marked in fig .",

    "the measured redshift for the h@xmath2 absorption corresponding to the peak position of the cross - correlation function , z@xmath24 = 1.9731 , is consistent with the redshift of the metal lines ( ge _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) .    in order to estimate the statistical significance of the correlation amplitude",
    ", we have simulated ly@xmath3  forest line spectra using the program described in dobrzycki & bechtold ( 1996 ) . in order to be conservative , we made synthetic spectra that matched the total absorption line density of all the strong lines in the q 0013@xmath0004 spectrum between 3150 and 3350    even though several of the strong lines are actually metal transitions for the z = 1.97 system .",
    "we cross - correlated 1000 simulated spectra with the synthetic h@xmath2 absorption line spectrum .",
    "the peak values of the cross - correlation function are all smaller than 0.55 .",

    "column densities from j = 0 , 1 are derived by the continuum - reconstruction procedure described by savage _",

    "the relative depletion of [ fe / zn ] implies that the dust - to - gas ratio in the z = 1.9731 absorber is @xmath14 50% of the milky way s value .",
    "the relatively normal dust - to - gas ratio is consistent with the high h@xmath2 fraction because h@xmath2 is very efficiently formed on dust grain surfaces ( savage _ et al .",
    "_ 1977 ) .",
    "as discussed by previous reviews ( e.g. spitzer & jenkins , 1975 ; shull & beckwith 1982 ) , the relative populations of j = 0 and 1 are established dominantly by thermal particle collisions , especially for saturated lines , so the excitation temperature , t@xmath37 , is approximately equal to the kinetic temperature , t@xmath38 , of the clouds .",
    "the measured t@xmath27 k in the z = 1.9731 absorber implies that the kinetic temperature is similar to that of the milky way diffuse clouds , @xmath39 = ( 77 @xmath15 17 ) k ( savage _ et al .",
    "the higher rotational levels are populated primarily by collisions , formation pumping and uv pumping and radiative cascade after photoabsorption to the lyman and werner bands ( e.g. spitzer & zweibel 1974 ; jura 1974 , 1975 ) .",
    "for example , the j = 4 is populated by direct formation pumping , and by uv pumping from j = 0 ( e.g. black & dalgarno 1976 ) . for densities",
    "less than @xmath40 @xmath10 , the j = 4 level is depopulated mainly by spontaneous emission ( dalgarno & wright 1972 ; elitzur & watson 1978 ) .",
    "therefore , in a steady state for j = 4 , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the uv pumping efficiency into the j = 4 level from the j = 0 level ( jura 1975 ) , @xmath43 s@xmath7 is the spontaneous transition probability ( dalgarno & wright 1972 ) , r is the h@xmath2 formation rate , n = n(h ) + 2n(h@xmath2 ) , and @xmath44 denotes the rate of absorption in the lyman and werner bands from the jth rotational level , including any attenuation ( see jura 1975 for details ) . the equilibrium between the h@xmath2 formation on dust grains and h@xmath2 destruction by absorption of lyman- and werner - band radiation ( e.g. jura 1975 ) can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the h@xmath2 dissociation rate ( jura 1975 ) . if the self - shielding in j = 0 , 1 levels is about the same , so that @xmath47 , then @xmath48 thus , @xmath49 s@xmath7 for the q 0013@xmath0004 cloud , which is about the same magnitude as that for @xmath36 per and @xmath35 oph clouds ( jura 1975 ) .",
    "we can use the analytic calculation for n(h@xmath2)/n(h ) within a h@xmath2 cloud by jura ( 1974 ) to estimate the h@xmath2 dissociation rate @xmath50 s@xmath7 .",
    "the photoabsorption rate in the lyman and werner bands outside of the cloud , @xmath51 s@xmath7 , which is similar to that of @xmath36 per cloud ( jura 1975 ) and about a factor of a few higher than that of @xmath35 oph cloud ( federman _ et al .",
    "further , the photoabsorption rate , @xmath52 , depends linearly on the local radiation field at 930 - 1150   ( jura 1974 ) , therefore , the @xmath52 for the z = 1.9731 absorber corresponds to an estimated local radiation field at 1000    of j@xmath53 @xmath54 ergs @xmath5s@xmath7hz@xmath7ster@xmath7 .",
    "thus j@xmath55 is about three orders of magnitude higher than the radiation field at the lyman limit , j@xmath56 , expected in the ambient igm at this redshift ( e.g. lu _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 ; bechtold 1994 ) .",
    "the radiation field at 1000   is therefore probably dominated by the uv emission by hot stars in this galaxy .    as mentioned above",
    ", the z = 1.9731 absorber has a similar dust - to - gas ratio to that of the milky way diffuse clouds .",
    "if we assume the h@xmath2 formation rate on grains , r @xmath57 @xmath58s@xmath7 , the typical rate for the milky way s clouds ( jura 1975 ) , then the inferred value of the number density n @xmath14 300 @xmath10 , about the same as that of the @xmath35 oph and @xmath36 per clouds .",
    "the derived values of the uv radiation field , density , and temperature in the z = 1.97 absorber are estimates based on the simple analysis of jura ( 1975 ) , which ignores the depth - dependence of the attenuation by dust and self - shielding of absorption lines . however , the results from this simple analysis are qualitatively consistent with that from more detailed modeling ( e.g. van dishoeck & black 1986 ) .",
    "we note that there is some uncertainty in the derived b - value . while b = 15 km  s@xmath7  provides the best fit to the observed values , smaller doppler parameters , for example , b = 2 km  s@xmath7 ,",
    "also give an acceptable solution .",
    "in this case , the implied column densities in j = 2 , 3 and 4 are so high they would suggest that conditions more like a photon - dominated region ( pdr ) are implied ( e.g. draine & bertoldi 1996 ; black & van dishoeck 1987 ; abgrall _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; le bourlet _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ; sternberg & dalgarno 1989 ) .",
    "the populations in j = 2 , 3 and 4 would be fit by a single excitation temperature of 350 k. this would leave excess population in j = 0 and 1 , suggesting a cold component at t@xmath59 k. the density of the absorber cloud would have to be lower than @xmath14 5000 @xmath10 in order for the j = 5 limit to be consistent with the populations in j = 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "finally , if the larger value b = 15 km  s@xmath7  is correct , then this absorber has a b - value which is much larger than that for typical milky way diffuse clouds ( e.g. spitzer _ et al .",
    "this would indicate that there is likely more than one velocity component .",
    "spectra of higher resolution would permit a better constrained analysis of the excitation and molecular abundance and provide a better understanding of physical conditions in this high redshift galaxy .",
