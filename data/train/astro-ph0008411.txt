    "it has only been very recently , with new facilities such as the keck telescopes and the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) , that early galaxy formation and galaxy evolution could be studied in detail .",
    "the high spatial resolution of the _ hst has revealed that young galaxies appear to be more numerous and smaller than nearby galaxies ( e.g. , phillips et al .",
    "1997 ) , and often have a distorted morphology ( e.g. , driver et al . 1998 ) .",
    "studies of lyman break galaxies ( e.g. , steidel 1999 ) and the hubble deep fields have also revealed that star formation was more intense at higher redshifts , although the star formation rate as a function of time is still heavily debated .",
    "taken together , these attributes suggest that galaxies have gone through a period of significant evolution since their formation .",
    "it has been difficult , however , to obtain detailed answers about the growth of galaxies and the rates of star formation and mergers . also , still unknown ,",
    "is the prevalence of modest agn activity at high redshifts . _ _",
    "part of the difficulty in trying to answer these problems is the extremely small angular sizes of distant galaxies",
    ". the exponential scale lengths of spiral galaxies are predominantly in the range from 1 to 10 kpc ( e.g. , de jong 1996 ) .",
    "thus , by a redshift of @xmath2=0.5 all disks have an angular scale length under an arcsecond .",
    "bulges are typically of order 10 times smaller than the disks .",
    "consequently , very few measurements have been made of the central spheroidal component of galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "several recent surveys have , however , been able to measure disk properties at optical wavelengths and look for evidence of disk evolution . in particular , schade et al .",
    "( 1996 ) as part of the cnoc2 redshift survey , showed that the peak surface brightness of disks increased 1.5 mag by @xmath30.8 .",
    "vogt ( 1999 ) argued that within their own data ( the deep project ) a similar effect could be explained primarily by selection bias , and they concluded that disk evolution is relatively mild .",
    "recent cold dark matter models by mao , mo , & white ( 1998 ) and dalcanton , spergel , & summers ( 1997 ) have been used to model the rate of galaxy growth and have made predictions that disk radii should decrease as ( 1+@xmath2)@xmath4 with roughly constant @xmath5-band luminosity so that the intrinsic surface brightness must increase . in all of these cases ,",
    "the use of @xmath5-band magnitudes has been a significant complication since the k - corrections and mass - to - luminosity ratios at @xmath5 are poorly constrained .",
    "it would be preferable to use infrared images , especially in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 bands .",
    "these wavelengths trace the older stellar population even at fairly high redshifts and are less affected by dust or recent star formation .",
    "unfortunately , _ hst can not currently observe at these wavelengths and nicmos images had insufficient angular resolution to resolve most distant bulges .",
    "_    adaptive optics ( ao ) systems provide real - time compensation of the blurring effects of the earth s atmosphere ( e.g. , beckers 1993 ) .",
    "most astronomical ao systems can be divided into two categories reflecting their method of wavefront sensing and correction .",
    "the keck ao system falls in the shack - hartmann based category and uses a lenslet array to measure the wavefront error at a location close to the conjugate of the primary mirror . a deformable mirror is also placed close to a pupil plane and is used to correct for the measured aberrations . since the characteristic scale length of atmosphere turbulence ( r@xmath8 @xmath9 10 - 40 cm ) is much smaller than telescope diameters , a large number of actuators is needed to produce good correction . for the keck ao system ( wizinowich et al .",
    "2000 ) , 349 actuators are updated at up to 660 hz . many of the most successful ao systems such as pueo ( rigaut et al . 1998 ) on the canada - france - hawaii telescope use a curvature sensor to measure wavefront error and have traditionally used a bimorph mirror with a relatively small number of degrees of freedom ( @xmath1050 ) . for several reasons including the use of avalanch photodiodes and the need to divide the light into fewer elements , curvature based systems can operate on fainter targets and have historically been more successful on extragalactic targets .    in any ao system , only a fraction of the light is restored to the diffraction - limited core , while the rest remains in an extended halo roughly the size of the seeing disk .",
    "a parameter used to describe the effectiveness of ao is the strehl ratio .",
    "it is the ratio of the peak intensity of the point - spread function ( psf ) compared to the theoretical peak intensity of a diffraction - limited source .",
    "a higher - order system with many actuators ( or degrees of freedom ) will normally result in a higher strehl ratio than a lower - order system on the same telescope .",
    "typical strehl ratios at 1.6 @xmath0 m for the keck system are around 0.3 for the guide star and fall off with angular separation .",
    "the strehl ratio is typically below 0.1 at a distance of @xmath11 from the guide star , although there is significant variation with atmospheric conditions .",
    "the keck system requires a guide star brighter than 12th mag at @xmath12 for full correction .",
    "partial correction is possible on guide stars as faint as 14th mag .",
    "this limitation of using bright sources for wavefront references has severely limited the use of ao systems on faint extragalactic targets .",
    "our study of faint field galaxies is the first of its kind and is only possible because of the high density of galaxies on the sky .",
    "deep infrared imaging surveys ( e.g. , djorgovski et al .",
    "1995 ) have shown that in the @xmath7 band ( 2.2 @xmath0 m ) , on average , there are 2 galaxies brighter than @xmath7 = 20 mag within @xmath13 of any star .",
    "these objects form a statistically unbiased set of galaxies at high redshift and provide an excellent sample for studying galaxy evolution . at a typical redshift between 0.25 and 1.0 ( corresponding to look back times of ( 3 - 8)@xmath1410@xmath15 years ago ) these objects",
    "are seen at a critical time in galaxy development .",
    "this corresponds to just after the time that the milky way s disk appears to have stabilized and when the oldest disk stars formed ( winget et al .",
    "recent evidence also indicates that star formation throughout the universe may have begun its decline to the present levels at around @xmath16 ( madau , pozzetti , & dickinson 1998 ) .",
    "between 1998 september and 1999 july , 25 stars were imaged with a non - ao infrared camera ( nirc ; matthews & soifer 1994 ) on the keck - i telescope .",
    "these images were used to provide a sample of galaxies within @xmath11 of potential guide stars .",
    "the stars were all a - type stars with a visual magnitude between 8 and 12 . over 200 galaxies",
    "were selected in these fields down to a @xmath7-band magnitude of 21.5 .",
    "many of the fields also have faint off - axis stars that can be used to measure the psf in order to determine the level of correction achieved .",
    "this is critical since the performance of ao systems can vary significantly with position in the sky and brightness of the guide star .",
    "these pre - ao images are detailed in larkin & glassman ( 1999 ) .",
    "the camera used for the ao observations was kcam , which was developed at ucla by james larkin and ian mclean in coordination with peter wizinowich and the ao development team .",
    "it uses a nicmos infrared array detector with 256@xmath14256 pixel elements .",
    "it is sensitive from 1 to 2.5 @xmath0 m , although the current filter set limit it to @xmath17 ( 1.27 @xmath0 m ) , @xmath6 ( 1.65 @xmath0 m ) and @xmath18 ( 2.15 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the plate scale in the @xmath6-band is 0@xmath190176 @xmath1 0@xmath190004 per pixel yielding a total field of view of 4@xmath1951 ( macintosh 2000 ) .",
    "this plate scale was selected to nyquist sample the @xmath6-band diffraction limit .    on 1999",
    "april 3 , we observed the first faint field galaxy ever examined with a shack - hartmann ao system . the galaxy is 18@xmath20 from a @xmath21=10.2 mag natural guide star ( ngs ) named ppm 127095 ( r.a.=10@xmath2205@xmath2326.86@xmath24 , dec=+16@xmath2521@xmath265018 , j2000 ) .",
    "the galaxy ( ppm 127095 - 8 + 16 ) is 19.0 mag in the @xmath6-band .",
    "its infrared colors are @xmath27=0.9 mag and @xmath28=0.8 mag .",
    "non - ao imaging marginally resolved the galaxy in good seeing conditions ( 05 ) , but no morphological information was available .",
    "a second star 17@xmath199 from the same ngs was used to measure the psf .",
    "six exposures of five minutes each were taken on the galaxy , with the psf star observed before and after the galaxy sequence . between each of the six exposures ,",
    "the galaxy was moved @xmath29 in a square dither pattern . the total integration time was limited by the demands of the ao commissioning program .",
    "a second galaxy was observed in a similar manner in september 1999 .",
    "the galaxy ( ppm 114182 + 6 + 27 ) is @xmath30 away from the 8th mag a - type star ppm 114182 ( r.a.=22@xmath2213@xmath2340.2@xmath24 , dec=+21@xmath2502@xmath26587 , j2000 ) and has a total @xmath6-band magnitude of 17.4 and an extent of roughly @xmath31 .",
    "its infrared colors are @xmath27=0.7 mag and @xmath28=0.1 mag . in this particular case ,",
    "the strehl ratio degraded rapidly during the observations from @xmath320.2 to less than @xmath320.1 . in the final image , only the first three frames ( each 5 minutes ) out of a total of six",
    "were utilized .",
    "the variability of the psf is discussed in the results section below .",
    "this galaxy was also observed with the optical spectrograph lris ( oke et al .",
    "1995 ) on the keck - ii telescope on 1999 december 12 .",
    "two 10-minute exposures were taken , but the first suffered from a large amount of scattered light from the ppm star and was not used .    the images were reduced using standard techniques for non - ao images .",
    "sky frames were created by masking off the quadrant with the galaxy from each frame and then they were medianed together without positional offset . for ppm  114182",
    "+ 6 + 27 , frames with poor strehl ratios were used for creating median sky frames even if they were nt used for the final image .",
    "flat field images were created from observations of the twilight sky .",
    "figure 1 shows the image of ppm  127095 - 8 + 16 .",
    "the contours of the galaxy are consistent with a disk galaxy with an inclination of 65@xmath25 .",
    "we removed the first - order effects of inclination by rotating the image , making its major axis horizontal , then resampling it in the vertical direction to produce roughly circular isophotes .",
    "the radial profile was subsequently produced by azimuthally averaging the image .",
    "this yields a high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) profile of the galaxy out to a surface brightness of @xmath3322 mag / arcsec@xmath34 .",
    "figure 1 also shows this radial profile for both the galaxy and the psf star .",
    "figure 1 . - faintest galaxy ever imaged with a high order adaptive optics system ( @xmath6=19.0 mag ) .",
    "this image of the galaxy ppm  127095 - 8 + 16 has a resolution of 50 milliarcseconds and also represents the highest resolution infrared image ever taken of a faint field galaxy .",
    "to decompose the galaxy into bulge and disk components , we created 2-dimensional model galaxies and convolved these models with the psf star image .",
    "we used an exponential profile for both the bulge and the disk and found that a de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) model for the bulge produced significantly worse fits .",
    "the free parameters of the model were the scale sizes and peak brightnesses of the exponential disk and bulge plus an overall background offset .",
    "this offset is necessary because the small field of view does not allow for an unambiguous background measurement .",
    "since we had good infrared photometry on the galaxy in non - ao images , however , we were able to constrain the flux in the galaxy within @xmath31 , which restricts the amount of background fluctuation that is allowed in the model .",
    "errors in the profile were estimated empirically by performing the azimuthal averaging in four angular bins , then determining the variation within the bins as a function of radius .",
    "a grid search was used to determine these parameters to the nearest two pixels for the disk and the nearest 0.2 pixel for the bulge .",
    "the best fit bulge scale length is 0042 with a 1@xmath35 range from 0025 to 0056 .",
    "the disk scale is 063 with 1@xmath35 limits of 042 and 081 . of the four galaxy parameters ,",
    "the disk scale size is the most uncertain due to a partial degeneracy with the background level",
    ". the measured peak surface brightness of the disk is 19.6 mag / arcsec@xmath34 at @xmath6 which corresponds to @xmath7=18.8 mag / arcsec@xmath34 ( using non - ao colors to convert @xmath6 to @xmath7 ) . the peak surface brightness of the bulge is @xmath6=17.2 mag / arcsec@xmath34 .",
    "the radial profile of the best fit model galaxy is also shown in figure 1 as a dashed curve .",
    "figure 2 shows the image and radial profile of ppm  114182 + 6 + 27 .",
    "unfortunately conditions were not as good as on the ppm  127095 - 8 + 16 source and the fwhm of the psf star was just under 01 .",
    "isophotal contours of the galaxy are approximately circular so no inclination correction is applied .",
    "the outer region of the radial profile is well fit with an exponential disk with a scale length of 092 with a 1@xmath35 range of 073 to 123 .",
    "the central region is best fit by an exponential bulge with radial scale length of 01 .",
    "however , if the disk component is subtracted from the galaxy , the residual is only slightly wider than the psf . given the variability of the psf during the observations of this galaxy it is possible that the central region is not resolved . using the point source model",
    ", the core has an @xmath6-band magnitude of 20.8 , @xmath324% of the total @xmath6-band luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "this core would be undetectable without ao .",
    "- ao image of a galaxy at the epoch of the formation of the solar system .",
    "this galaxy ( ppm  114182 + 6 + 27 ) shows evidence for a disk but perhaps not a true bulge .",
    "instead a central unresolved core is found along with a point source 0@xmath196 south of the center .",
    "the lris spectrum of ppm  114182 + 6 + 27 ( figure 3 ) shows no spectral lines but does have a significant break at 5500   ( observed frame ) .",
    "if we interpret this as the 4000   break we find good agreement with a template spectrum at a redshift of 0.37@xmath10.05 . at this redshift ,",
    "the physical scale size of the disk is 5.1 kpc and the scale size of the bulge is less than 300 pc ( 3 pixels ) .",
    "this corresponds to a look back time of 4.4 gyr , almost exactly the estimated age of our own solar system .",
    "other possibilities for the identification of the break would require a much higher redshift and would be inconsistent with the observed surface brightness of the disk .",
    "regardless of redshift or cosmological model , the ratio of bulge to disk scale size is below 0.12 . for the galaxy",
    "ppm  127095 - 8 + 16 , no redshift is currently available .",
    "for direct comparison to the properties of local disk galaxies we selected the de jong ( 1996 ) sample of 86 nearly face - on spiral galaxies .",
    "its advantage is that it contains accurate bulge and disk parameters in all major bands from @xmath36 to @xmath7 . at a redshift of 0.37",
    "the galaxy ppm  114182 + 6 + 27 has a luminosity distance of 2.1 gpc giving it an absolute @xmath7-band magnitude of -24.4 .",
    "this is comparable to the most luminous objects in the de jong sample . perhaps more importantly ,",
    "its peak disk surface brightness is 17.2 mag / arcsec@xmath34 after correcting for the ( 1+@xmath2)@xmath37 fading .",
    "this is again near the maximum for all of the local sample of galaxies .",
    "large disk galaxies with comparable scale lengths ( 3 - 6 kpc ) range from 17.5 to roughly 19.0 mag / arcsec@xmath34 making the ao galaxy brighter than the brightest local galaxy of comparable size , and @xmath321.0 mag brighter than the average . the central source , however , has an absolute magnitude of -20.8 in @xmath6 which is towards the middle of the local distribution of bulges .",
    "its size , however , is compact with a scale length under 500 pc .",
    "- optical spectrum of ppm  114182 + 6 + 27 .",
    "it has been shifted to match the spectrum of the local elliptical galaxy ic  4889 .",
    "the best shift corresponds to a redshift of 0.37@xmath10.05 primarily based on the position of the spectral break at 4000   .",
    "no emission lines are visible .",
    "one possible explanation for an unresolved core is a nuclear starburst .",
    "some local galaxies exhibit greatly enhanced star formation within the central kpc , often due to tidal interactions .",
    "this phenomenon might be expected to increase at high redshift as galaxy separations decrease .",
    "we compared the bulge with the local starburst galaxy ngc 1808 .",
    "tacconi - garman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found that the central 750 pc of ngc 1808 has an absolute @xmath7-band magnitude of -22.3 corresponding to a star - formation rate of 11 m@xmath38 per year . using @xmath28= 0.4 mag ,",
    "this is only 0.1 mag different from our high - redshift core .",
    "the optical spectrum ( figure 3 ) does not contain a bright [ oii ]  @xmath393727 emission line , however , and is generally inconsistent with strong ongoing star formation .",
    "if most of the star formation in the disk occurred at an even earlier time , then the [ oii ] line may be too faint for detection .",
    "the central core , where star formation may be active , is too weak to be detected in the spectrum since it was taken without ao and thus includes most of the galaxy .",
    "another possible contributor to the core would be an active nucleus .",
    "again , the core is probably too faint to have produced detectable emission lines in the lris spectrum .",
    "it is interesting to consider that ao spectroscopy may be one of the most sensitive methods for detecting faint agns at high redshifts since most of the starlight is rejected .",
    "the ao image of ppm 114182 + 6 + 27 ( figure 2 ) also shows a point source 06 south of the nucleus , with an @xmath6-band magnitude of 22 .",
    "the knot then has an absolute @xmath6-band magnitude of -20 and may be a very luminous star - forming region .",
    "similar `` super star clusters '' are seen in local galaxies , but this would be among the most extreme examples and is about 2 mag brighter than the brightest knot in the interacting galaxies ngc 6090 ( dinshaw et al .",
    "it is likely that the knot in ppm  114182 + 6 + 27 is composed of many such regions and may even be a second galactic nucleus indicating an ongoing merger or simply a companion galaxy seen in projection against the disk . if it is a star forming knot and others like this one prove to be common , then it may indicate that star formation at high redshifts was often in giant superclusters .",
    "we have presented new near - diffraction - limited images of cosmologically distant field galaxies taken with the keck ao system .",
    "even these preliminary images show significant detail and provide morphological information on scales as small as 005 .",
    "this gives us the first ability to accurately study morphological evolution at cosmological distances from 8 - 10 meter telescopes .",
    "both of the objects presented here show a smooth exponential disk and a bulge with a scale size at or below 0.1 of the disk , consistent with local objects .",
    "one of the galaxies has a large star - forming region or possibly a companion galaxy and an elevated peak surface brightness .",
    "we have recently obtained similar images of over 10 additional galaxies and more observations are scheduled .",
    "we soon hope to produce a statistically meaningful population study of these objects . also within the next year , with new spectrographic capabilities and infrared colors , we plan to search for the presence of active nuclei , study the stellar population ages , and measure the rotation curves of these cosmologically young objects .",
    "we would like to acknowledge the contributions of the members of the keck ao team including the wavefront controller team at llnl .",
