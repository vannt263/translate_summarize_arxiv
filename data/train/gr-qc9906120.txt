    "quantum particle creation effects are important in black hole physics  @xcite , the generation of density perturbations and primordial gravitational waves  @xcite , and reheating in inflationary cosmological models  @xcite , the damping of anisotropy in the early universe  @xcite , and perhaps for even the very existence of a cosmological constant  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the issue of quantum backreaction due to these effects could also be important for understanding black holes  @xcite and the dynamics of the early universe  @xcite .    in a curved spacetime background",
    ", it is not possible in general to define a unique vacuum state  @xcite .",
    "however , if the background expansion is sufficiently slow the notion of an adiabatic vacuum state defined via wkb expansions comes closest to the minkowski vacuum  @xcite . for frw",
    "cosmological models , adiabatic regularization  @xcite has been shown to be particularly convenient , and equivalent to covariant point - splitting  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a consistent , physically simple formulation of the general time - dependent initial value problem for a quantum scalar field of arbitrary mass @xmath3 , and curvature coupling @xmath4 in a background homogeneous , isotropic frw cosmology , which is suitable for implementation on a computer .",
    "we present numerical results for particle creation in de sitter space , and outline how the formalism can be applied to cosmological backreaction .",
    "we make use of an adiabatic particle number basis obtained via a time - dependent bogoliubov transformation , in which the energy - momentum tensor of a quantum field in a frw universe breaks up naturally into a ` particle ' and a ` vacuum ' contribution , the latter isolating the ultraviolet divergences .",
    "these divergences are then removed using adiabatic subtractions .",
    "the remaining finite energy density and pressure of the quantum field admit an intuitive quasiclassical interpretation in terms of the average number of particles present at a given time .",
    "these terms can be interpreted as the energy density and pressure of the produced ` particles ' if the universe entered an adiabatic era .",
    "this definition is motivated by and is a direct outgrowth of parallel definitions of particle number in time dependent problems in field theories in minkowski space , such as scalar qed and @xmath6 theory  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the concept of particle is ambiguous in time dependent backgrounds .",
    "covariantly conserved quantities such as the renormalized expectation value of @xmath7 can be defined without ambiguity ( save the usual freedom associated with the additive finite renormalization of conserved local tensors ) , although the division of @xmath7 into ` vacuum ' and ` particle ' components is not unique . however , if one requires that the intrinsically quantum ultraviolet power divergences of @xmath2 are isolated in the ` vacuum ' component of @xmath2 , then the ambiguity in the remainder is considerably reduced .",
    "in fact , this requirement is equivalent to matching the definition of ` vacuum ' to an adiabatic basis up to at least second adiabatic order .",
    "one does not wish to match the vacuum to higher than fourth adiabatic order since this would introduce higher than fourth order time derivatives in the backreaction equations .",
    "hence the only remaining ambiguity in the definition of the ` particles ' resides in the treatment of the fourth adiabatic order terms , and is actually relatively mild .",
    "we introduce a precise definition of adiabatic basis in this paper which resolves the remaining ambiguity and use it to renormalize the energy - momentum tensor and study the particle creation process in de sitter background .",
    "the resulting renormalized @xmath1 has a physically transparent , quasiclassical form in terms of the average number of created ` particles ' , and is the appropriate source term for dynamical backreaction of the quantum field on the metric in semiclassical cosmology . since our main interest here is the initial value problem in semiclassical gravity , we consider general frw - invariant initial states .",
    "to prevent the occurrence of initial time singularities , we restrict attention to initial conditions which are also matched to the appropriate instantaneous fourth order adiabatic vacuum at the initial time  @xcite .",
    "the renormalized @xmath0 we obtain is cutoff independent , and covariantly conserved . as a consequence of our analysis we demonstrate that these features do not depend on the choice of time parametrization ( _ e.g. , _ comoving versus conformal time ) , thus clarifying some previous discussions in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we have implemented a numerical scheme to compute the time evolution of the renormalized @xmath8 which preserves covariant conservation and cutoff independence . though our scheme is applicable to general frw spacetimes , in this paper",
    "we have restricted ourselves to de sitter space with closed spatial sections .",
    "we have checked covariant conservation and cutoff independence of the renormalized @xmath8 for a variety of masses , couplings to curvature , spatial cutoffs , and non de sitter - invariant initial states .",
    "we consider in some detail the time structure of the particle creation process for massive scalar particles in de sitter space starting from a well - defined adiabatic initial state , which is not de sitter invariant .",
    "the particle number in a particular momentum mode increases sharply when the physical wavelength of that mode crosses the de sitter horizon .",
    "we show how the adiabatic particle basis is useful in interpreting the numerical results for the time evolution of the renormalized energy and pressure .",
    "we apply the same method to the massless case with @xmath9 and @xmath10 . for the case",
    "@xmath10 , as expected from conformal invariance , there is no particle production , and the renormalized value of @xmath2 is determined by the trace anomaly  @xcite .",
    "the case of @xmath11 is important because the two helicity states of gravitons obey a wave equation which corresponds to this value of the mass parameter @xmath12 , and there are several indications of strong infrared effects for such fields in de sitter space .",
    "for example it is known that no de sitter invariant state of the kind usually assumed , implicitly or explicitly , in inflationary models of the early universe exists for massless , minimally coupled scalar fields  @xcite , and that the graviton propagator has unusual infrared behavior in de sitter space  @xcite .",
    "we will see that the exact minimally coupled , massless case @xmath13 is special in that in this case , at late times the renormalized @xmath8 goes asymptotically to the constant de sitter invariant value found by allen and folacci  @xcite , and not to the zero mass limit of the bunch - davies vacuum  @xcite . for any other nonzero values of @xmath14 and @xmath4 such that @xmath15 the energy - momentum tensor grows without bound , linearly with cosmic time @xmath16 , for adiabatic finite initial data .",
    "( we point out that this result is a quantum effect , and not a classical instability . ) hence at least in these cases it is clear that the backreaction of @xmath8 on the metric can not be neglected at late times .",
    "we have also investigated the case of a small mass , minimally coupled field , results for which will be reported elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section we review scalar quantum field theory in general frw spacetimes , which will serve to fix our notation and conventions . in section iii",
    "we introduce the adiabatic number basis by a certain time dependent bogoliubov transformation on the exact mode functions . in section",
    "iv we derive the energy density and pressure for a scalar field of arbitrary mass and curvature coupling in homogeneous , isotropic cosmologies as sums ( or integrals ) over the time dependent fourier mode amplitudes and express the energy and pressure in the adiabatic number basis , showing explicitly how to isolate and remove the ultraviolet divergences in the vacuum contributions to these mode sums . in section v we present numerical results for de sitter space , for the massive , conformally coupled and minimally coupled scalars , for a variety of finite non de sitter invariant initial states . in section",

    "we will consider states of the scalar field , which like the geometry ( [ frws ] ) , are also spatially homogeneous and isotropic .",

    "theory it has been shown that it is always possible to fix the bilinears  @xcite @xmath78 by making use of the freedom in the initial phases of the mode functions @xmath79 , with no loss of generality .",
    "precisely the same conclusion applies here . because of the ubiquitous appearance of the bose - einstein factor in succeeding sections we will often make use of the the definition @xmath80 in what follows",
    "the ` vacuum ' state in this basis corresponds to the choice @xmath81 .",
    "the observation underlying the introduction of the adiabatic basis is that the mode equation ( [ modefns ] ) generally possesses time dependent solutions which have no clear _ a priori _ physical meaning in terms of particles or antiparticles .",
    "the familiar notion that positive energy solutions of the wave equation correspond to particles while negative energy solutions correspond to antiparticles is quite meaningless in time dependent backgrounds , where the energy of individual particle / antiparticle modes is not conserved , and no such neat invariant separation into positive and negative energy solutions of the wave equation is possible .",
    "this is just a reflection of the fact that particle number does not correspond to a sharp operator which commutes with the hamiltonian , _",
    "i.e. , _ particle / antiparticle pairs are created or destroyed , and physical particle number is not conserved in time dependent backgrounds  @xcite .",
    "it is equally clear physically that in the limit of slowly varying time dependent backgrounds there should be an appropriate slowly varying particle number operator which becomes exactly conserved in the limit of @xmath82 vanishing .",
    "clearly this slowly varying particle number is _ not _ the @xmath83 defined with respect to the time independent heisenberg basis by ( [ part ] ) above .",
    "this @xmath83 is part of the initial data , a strict constant of motion , no matter how rapidly varying the spacetime geometry is .",
    "the physical particle number at time @xmath16 must be defined instead with respect to a time dependent basis which permits a semiclassical correspondence limit to ordinary positive energy plane wave solutions in the limit of slowly varying @xmath84 .",
    "this adiabatic basis is specified by introducing the adiabatic mode functions  @xcite @xmath85 which are guaranteed to satisfy the wronskian condition ( [ wron ] ) for any real , positive function @xmath86 .",
    "the phase @xmath87 in ( [ adbmod ] ) can be measured from any convenient point such as the initial time @xmath75 .",
    "if one requires @xmath88 to be a solution of the _ exact _ mode equation ( [ modefns ] ) , a second order non - linear equation for the frequency @xmath89 is obtained .",
    "however , the utility of the wkb form of this equation is that instead of solving for @xmath90 exactly , it can be used to generate an asymptotic series in order of time derivatives of the background metric .",
    "terminating this asymptotic series at a given order defines an adiabatic mode function @xmath91 ( to that order ) , which will no longer be exact solution of the original mode equation ( [ modefns ] ) , but which can serve as a template adiabatic basis against which the exact mode functions @xmath63 can be compared .",
    "this is accomplished by expressing the exact mode functions in the adiabatic basis by means of a time dependent bogoliubov transformation of the general form  @xcite , @xmath92 the precise form of the time dependent bogoliubov coefficients @xmath93 and @xmath94 will be determined once we specify completely the adiabatic basis functions @xmath95 , and these will be used to define a time dependent adiabatic particle number .",
    "the first few orders of the asymptotic adiabatic expansion of the frequency @xmath90 in powers of the time variation of the metric are given by @xmath96 explicitly to second adiabatic order in the asymptotic expansion , @xmath97 where we have dropped third and higher order terms in the ellipsis .",
    "from this we evaluate @xmath98 correct to adiabatic order three .",
    "finally we have @xmath99 where terms of adiabatic order higher than four have been discarded .",
    "notice that the terms fall off faster with large @xmath55 as we develop the expansion to higher adiabatic orders , and therefore the adiabatic expansion is an asymptotic expansion in powers of @xmath100 which matches the behavior of the exact mode functions in the far ultraviolet region .",
    "this is what makes the expansion useful for defining a particle number basis , since it can be used to isolate the divergences of the vacuum energy - momentum tensor .",
    "since @xmath101 is a dimension four operator in four spacetime dimensions , its divergences are obtained by expanding to adiabatic order four , and no higher orders are required .",
    "in fact all terms in @xmath102 beyond the first three of ( [ adbfour ] ) fall off faster than @xmath103 as @xmath104 , and therefore will lead to convergent mode sums ( integrals ) and finite contributions to @xmath1 .",
    "our method will make use of these well - known results and take them one step further . instead of demanding that @xmath105 satisfy the exact mode equation ( [ modefns ] )",
    "we will _ define _ @xmath106 to match the terms in @xmath107 that fall off most slowly in @xmath55 , in order to isolate the divergences of the energy - momentum tensor in the vacuum sector in the most convenient way .",
    "the exact mode functions @xmath108 will be written then as a linear combination of @xmath91 defined by ( [ adbmod ] ) and its complex conjugate .",
    "the @xmath105 defined in this way specify an adiabatic number basis in which particle creation in the homogeneous , isotropic state of the quantum field @xmath34 can be discussed in a physically meaningful way , free of ultraviolet divergences .    since the bogoliubov transformation ( [ bogf ] ) may be viewed as a pair of canonical transformations in the phase space spanned by the field variables and their conjugate momenta , a complete specification of the transformation between bases requires a condition on the first time derivatives of the mode functions as well .",
    "the general form of this condition which preserves the wronskian relation ( [ wron ] ) is @xmath109   \\alpha_k(t ) \\tilde f_k(t )   +   \\left [ i w_k(t ) + { v_k(t ) \\over 2 } \\right ] \\beta_k(t ) \\tilde f_k^*(t)\\ , , \\label{dbog}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which introduces a second real function of time @xmath110 .",
    "usually this second independent function @xmath110 , which contains only _ odd _ adiabatic orders , has been set equal to @xmath111 in earlier discussions of the adiabatic expansion .",
    "hence the general adiabatic basis as a canonical transformation in phase space , where @xmath90 and @xmath110 are treated independently and on an equal footing , has not been fully realized .",
    "we will make use of the freedom to choose both @xmath90 and @xmath110 independently in our development .",
    "the precise choice of @xmath90 and @xmath110 will be postponed until the next section , where we present the detailed analysis of the ultraviolet divergences of the energy - momentum tensor .    for any real @xmath90 and @xmath110 the linear relations ( [ bogf ] ) and ( [ dbog ] )",

    "_ , @xmath117 so that @xmath118 then the last expression for the adiabatic particle number at arbitrary time @xmath16 in ( [ adbpar ] ) may be viewed as the sum of the particle number present at the initial time , @xmath83 , plus the particles created by the time varying geometry , @xmath119 , multiplied by the bose enhancement factor , @xmath120 , to account for both spontaneous and induced particle creation processes .",
    "because the rapidly varying phase @xmath121 drops out of the definition of the particle number in ( [ adbpar ] ) , @xmath122 is a relatively slowly varying function of time .",
    "in fact , if @xmath90 and @xmath110 are chosen appropriately to match the adiabatic mode functions to a given order , @xmath122 will be an adiabatic invariant to that order .",
    "on the other hand the bilinear @xmath123 is a very rapidly varying function of time , since the phase variable @xmath121 does not drop out of this combination .",
    "we can remove the leading part of this rapid phase variation by defining the quantities @xmath124 which together with @xmath122 span the space of three non - trivial real bilinears in the adiabatic creation and destruction operators .",
    "because of the relation ( [ can ] ) these three time dependent functions are not independent , but rather are related by @xmath125 where @xmath126 is a strict constant of motion , dependent only on the initial data . differentiating ( [ adbpar ] ) with respect to time and using ( [ abdif ] ) , and the definitions ( [ ridef ] ) , we obtain as well , @xmath127 the two relations ( [ magc ] ) and ( [ dpart ] ) imply that @xmath128 and @xmath129 may be eliminated in favor of @xmath122 and @xmath130 , if desired .",

    "the physical reason for this fact is that for any smoothly varying @xmath173 the large @xmath55 behavior of the exact mode functions is determined by the wkb - like adiabatic form ( [ adbmod ] ) , and the local ultraviolet divergences of the energy - momentum tensor are identical to those obtained in the adiabatic expansion of the mode functions .",
    "let us consider the matching of the large @xmath55 behavior of the exact and adiabatic mode functions order by order in the adiabatic expansion .",
    "if we were to take @xmath174 and @xmath175 , then we would isolate the leading ( _ i.e. , _ quartic ) divergences in the energy density and pressure . indeed ,",
    "to lowest adiabatic order we obtain the quartic and quadratic divergent terms , @xmath176 by differentiating @xmath177 with respect to comoving time , one can easily show that this adiabatic order zero energy - momentum is formally conserved . it obeys ( [ cons ] ) provided that the time derivative commutes with the sum ( integral ) over @xmath55 , _",
    "i.e. , _ that any cutoff in the mode sum over comoving momentum is time independent . thus subtracting it from the full expressions",
    "preserves the conservation law required by general coordinate invariance , even though the forms ( [ adbz ] ) do _ not _ correspond to an explicitly covariant local counterterm in the effective action .",
    "the reason for this lack of manifest covariance is that the adiabatic expansion treats time differently than space , and in fact cutting off the sums in spatial momentum @xmath55 corresponds precisely to a point separation in the spacelike hypersurface of constant @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "when this is recognized , then the correspondence between the adiabatic order zero expressions ( [ adbz ] ) and the subtraction of covariant countertems generated by point splitting in the spacelike direction may be made fully manifest and becomes completely justified . in the language of general renormalization theory , power law divergences are ` non - universal , ' in the sense that their precise form depends on the regularization scheme employed , which in and of itself has no physical significance .",
    "this is clear from the fact that in dimensional regularization power law divergences do not appear at all .",
    "hence any convenient scheme , covariant or not , may be employed to isolate and remove these divergences , although the form of the subtractions will not be explicitly covariant if the regularization scheme is not , and the existence of a covariant point splitting procedure equivalent to the non - covariant adiabatic subtraction is necessary to establish the latter s validity .",
    "the fact that the subtraction of the non - covariant divergent sums such as ( [ adbz ] ) in adiabatic regularization nevertheless preserves the conservation equation ( [ cons ] ) is _ a posteriori _ evidence enough that the procedure is completely consistent with general covariance , which is all that we require from a practical point of view .",
    "the subtraction of the adiabatic order zero expressions from the full energy density and pressure in ( [ epdecomp ] ) leaves subleading quadratic divergences still present .",
    "hence we must match the function @xmath90 and @xmath110 to the adiabatic expansion to at least one higher order .",

    "the full justification of this subtraction requires the covariant point splitting analysis . at this order",
    "all the non - universal power law divergences are removed .    proceeding in this way one more time we might choose @xmath183 and @xmath184 in order to match the remaining logarithmic divergences in the vacuum sector and leave behind completely finite state dependent terms in @xmath160 and @xmath185 .",
    "it is necessary to subtract up to adiabatic order four to obtain the correct finite trace anomaly in the conformally invariant limit .",
    "however , the remaining logarithmic divergences in the energy - momentum tensor ( unlike the power divergences ) correspond directly to local covariant counterterms in the quantum effective action , namely the fourth order local invariants , @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "the variation of the first of these vanishes in conformally flat frw metrics , and a possible third linear combination of @xmath188 and @xmath187 vanishes by the invariance of the topological gauss - bonnet density , @xmath189 , under local variations of the metric .",
    "hence only the logarithmic cutoff dependence of the coefficient of the covariantly conserved tensor @xmath190 , defined by ( [ hone ] ) and ( [ honecomp ] ) , remains after the adiabatic order two terms ( [ ettwo ] ) have been subtracted .",
    "in fact , it is easy to see that the fourth adiabatic energy density and trace are given by @xmath191 as is evident from these expressions the adiabatic terms of order four are of two kinds : logarithmically divergent pieces , which are proportional to the local geometric tensor @xmath192 , and finite pieces which are given in terms of the quantities @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "the logarithmic cutoff dependence of @xmath8 may be absorbed into a renormalization of the coefficient of the tensor @xmath190 in the backreaction equations , _",
    "i.e. , _ by a renormalization of the coupling constant of the local @xmath187 term in the effective action  @xcite .",
    "since such a term has to be introduced in principle into the backreaction equations in any case , we may simply include an explicit logarithmic cutoff dependence ( with the correct coefficient ) in the bare @xmath187 coupling to cancel the remaining logarithmic cutoff dependence in the vacuum energy - momentum tensor of the quantum field .",
    "the resulting backreaction equations will be fully cutoff independent and obey the covariant conservation relation ( [ cons ] ) .    in electrodynamic backreaction problems",
    "the analogous procedure has been employed in practical numerical implementations  @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic divergence in the electric current expectation value @xmath195 in that case does not need to be removed by explicit subtractions .",
    "rather the logarithmic cutoff dependence of the bare electric charge , @xmath196 , is used to cancel the cutoff dependence of the expectation value of the current @xmath195 in the full backreaction equations , @xmath197 .",
    "provided that the momentum cutoff is chosen much larger than the inverse scale of temporal variation of the electric current and fields @xmath198 , it can be demonstrated numerically that the results are independent of the cutoff , as they should be .",
    "this can be checked explicitly by running the numerical code with several different cutoffs and verifying that the evolution is unchanged , provided that the bare charge is rescaled logarithmically with the changed cutoff in such a way as to keep the renormalized charge fixed . in other words , rather than striving to eliminate it explicitly , the remaining logarithmic cutoff dependence in the expectation value of @xmath199 may actually be used to our advantage , in order to check the cutoff independence in the numerical evolution of the backreaction equations .",
    "this procedure may be implemented in the semiclassical backreaction equations as follows .",
    "we propose to avoid explicit subtraction of the logarithmic cutoff dependence of the energy and pressure , by checking that it cancels against the logarithmic cutoff dependence of the bare fourth order coupling multiplying the tensor @xmath190 , which appears in the semiclassical einstein equation of backreaction .",
    "if we denote the bare coupling of the @xmath187 term in the action by @xmath200 then the logarithmic cutoff dependence in the backreaction equations will be removed if @xmath201 where @xmath202 is the cutoff in the comoving momentum sum ( integral ) and @xmath203 is an arbitrary finite renormalization scale . the finite adiabatic order",
    "four pieces in the energy - momentum tensor are not taken into account by this procedure , so they can be added back in by hand to the backreaction equations .",
    "besides being conceptually and technically somewhat simpler than the usual approach of explicitly subtracting all terms up to adiabatic order four , this proposal is a significant simplification for practical implementation of the backreaction equations on a computer since @xmath102 as given by ( [ adbfour ] ) involves both three and four time derivatives of the scale factor @xmath173  @xcite .",
    "these higher order derivatives present problems for the standard approach to numerical backreaction calculations , when they occur inside the mode sums , since one can not determine the form of @xmath8 to step the equations forward in time without first knowing these higher derivatives , which are themselves determined through the backreaction equations by @xmath8 .    since in the general frw backreaction problem we will not remove the logarithmic cutoff dependence in the energy and pressure connected with the geometric tensor @xmath190 , we will not need to match the functions @xmath90 and @xmath110 to their full fourth adiabatic order values .",
    "however even if these functions are matched only to second adiabatic order , fourth order terms in the ` vacuum ' contributions to the energy and pressure , @xmath204 and @xmath205 , will be generated inevitably , from the square of adiabatic order two terms in @xmath90 . in order to cancel these terms in @xmath206 and @xmath205",
    "we will choose @xmath90 to be @xmath207 _ plus _ those additional terms on the first line of ( [ adbfour ] ) which fall off only as fast as @xmath208 at large @xmath55 .",
    "likewise we will choose @xmath110 to be @xmath209 _ plus _ the one additional term on the first line of ( [ adbthree ] ) which falls off only as fast as @xmath210 at large @xmath55 .",
    "since we are not attempting to isolate the adiabatic order four logarithmic divergences , and wish only to avoid introducing spurious fourth order divergences from the square of @xmath211 , we may evaluate the fourth order terms in @xmath90 and @xmath110 on a spacetime with _ vanishing _ @xmath190 .",
    "this is the minimal choice of @xmath90 and @xmath110 , which leaves behind only a logarithmic cutoff dependence in @xmath160 and @xmath185 proportional to the geometric tensor @xmath190 .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath190 , with components given in eq .",
    "( [ honecomp ] ) , allows us to make the following replacements , @xmath212 when evaluating @xmath90 and @xmath110 .",
    "hence the higher derivative terms in the first line of ( [ adbfour ] ) become @xmath213 and we finally _ define _ : @xmath214 to specify fully the adiabatic particle number basis for the scalar field of arbitrary mass and curvature coupling in a general frw spacetime .    some comments about this definition and the corresponding choice of basis bear emphasizing .",
    "first , by construction these choices for @xmath90 and @xmath110 match all the quartic and quadratic power law divergences in the energy and pressure in a general frw spacetime .",
    "thus the subtraction of the adiabatic two expressions ( [ ettwo ] ) from the bare energy density and trace will leave behind only the logarithmic cutoff dependence proportional to @xmath190 , whenever it is non - vanishing .",
    "second , with these requirements , the choice of @xmath90 and @xmath110 , and hence the adiabatic basis they define is the almost unique , minimal choice . since the adiabatic ( order zero and two ) matching is required to eliminate the non - universal power divergences in the energy - momentum tensor , and since the matching of any higher adiabatic orders requires higher order time derivatives of the scale factor which we exclude , the only freedom left in the choice of @xmath90 and @xmath110 are adiabatic order four terms in @xmath90 and third order terms in @xmath110 , which either give rise to local @xmath190 terms in @xmath8 or fall off faster than @xmath215 and hence lead to finite reapportionment of the terms in the energy - momentum tensor between ` particle ' and ` vacuum ' contributions .",
    "this residual ambiguity in the separation of the energy - momentum terms into particle and vacuum contributions can not be removed except by an essentially arbitrary choice .",
    "it reflects the necessary uncertainty in the definition of the ` particle ' concept in time varying external fields .",
    "however the residual ambiguity is fairly mild and does not affect severely the physical interpretation of particles in semiclassical cosmology where the variations of the metric are assumed small in planck units .",
    "our definitions of @xmath90 and @xmath110 in ( [ wdef ] ) and ( [ vdef ] ) are the _ minimal _ ones , involving no more than second derivatives of the metric , that make such an interpretation of the separation of @xmath8 into quantum vacuum and quasiclassical particle components possible for slowly varying @xmath173 .",
    "third , for the massless , conformally coupled scalar , @xmath216 and @xmath217 , the definitions ( [ wdef ] ) and ( [ vdef ] ) simplify considerably : @xmath218 and @xmath219 . referring back to ( [ bigom ] ) and ( [ dpart ] ) we observe that the adiabatic particle number @xmath122 is _ constant _ in this case , _",

    "the definition of adiabatic particle basis specified by ( [ wdef ] ) and ( [ vdef ] ) is meaningful even in this quite infrared sensitive case , which is the most analogous to linearized graviton fluctuations .    in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to a test field approximation , and do not consider the backreaction of the created ` particles ' in the background geometry .",
    "for the special case of de sitter , which will be the particular spacetime under study , the tensor @xmath190 vanishes . hence in this fixed background the one remaining logarithmic cutoff dependence proportional to the geometric tensor @xmath190 ( after subtraction of the adiabatic order two expressions ) will vanish identically , and the resulting renormalized energy - momentum tensor is fully cutoff independent , without any additional countertems . in order to compare the value of the finite @xmath7 with previous authors ,",

    "an additional technical point is the fact that when performing the adiabatic subtraction one should use the continuous measure , and not the discrete one , even in the case of a closed cosmological model  @xcite .",
    "this scheme is necessary to compute finite casimir energies and the correct trace anomaly , for example .",

    "the de sitter invariant ` vacuum ' state ( or variants thereof ) is by far the most commonly discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "however , from the point of view of the initial value problem for the scalar field theory , specified on a complete spacelike cauchy surface , there is no _ a priori _ reason to impose the global @xmath239 invariance of de sitter spacetime .",

    "that is , we can trust our results until times of order of @xmath261 , with @xmath261 given by @xmath262 .    in figs . 2 and 3 we plot the particle number @xmath263 in de sitter space for various values of @xmath55 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , starting at @xmath264 and @xmath265 ( in units of @xmath266 ) with adiabatic vacuum initial conditions , and the choices @xmath267 and @xmath268 . when @xmath3 and @xmath4 are such that @xmath269 the particle number increases sharply ( with a rise time of order @xmath270 ) when the physical wavelength of the mode crosses the de sitter horizon , _",
    "i.e. , _ when @xmath271 , where @xmath272 when the initial time @xmath273 , the de sitter universe ( in closed spatial coordinates ) is always expanding thereafter and each mode can cross the horizon and go through its particle creation event at most once . this situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ particle6 ] and fig .",
    "[ particle0 ] . if the initial time @xmath274 , the spatial sections first contract , then expand , and some modes can cross the horizon twice , once on the way in and then again on the way out , corresponding to the two solutions of ( [ horiz ] ) at @xmath275 .",

    "the behavior of the horizon crossing time with @xmath55 in accordance with ( [ horiz ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ horizon6 ] and fig .",
    "[ horizon0 ] .    in figs . 5 and 6 we plot the logarithms of the comoving momentum as a function of their crossing time @xmath276 .",
    "the lines correspond to the fits , @xmath277 and @xmath278 , for @xmath10 and @xmath9 , respectively , in agreement with the previous considerations regarding the nature of the particle production at horizon crossing and earlier work on stochastic inflation  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the physical picture of particle creation as a parametric resonance between the wave function of the particle mode and the geometry , which is maximized when the physical wavelength of the mode is the same as the horizon scale .    in figs .",
    "7 and 8 we have plotted the renormalized values of the energy , trace , and pressure for the cases considered above .",
    "the most important feature of the figures to note is that the particle number goes to a constant which is almost independent of @xmath55 at late times , when the modes freezes out .",
    "the value of the constant plateau value of @xmath122 at late times and large @xmath55 can be compared with that calculated by one of us  @xcite analytically some years ago , namely @xmath279 , assuming an initial ` in ' vacuum state corresponding to pure positive frequency as @xmath280 .",
    "although this ` in ' state is a higher order adiabatic vacuum state than the one considered in the present work , the difference between the two goes to zero rapidly for large @xmath281 .",
    "we remark that if we had chosen a different separation of particle and vacuum components of @xmath8 by making a slightly different definition of @xmath90 and @xmath110 at adiabatic order four , then the detailed time profile of the @xmath122 near the horizon crossing would be slightly different , but the location of the crossing time and the plateau values of particle number at later times observed in the figures would not be altered .",
    "the fact that the particle number density in any given @xmath55 mode does not redshift away despite the exponential expansion is related to the fact that these created particles do not satisfy a standard dust or matter equation of state with @xmath282 , @xmath283 . rather as figs .",
    "[ etp-6 ] and [ etp-0 ] show , the matter plus vacuum contributions to the renormalized energy and pressure satisfy the de sitter equation of state , @xmath284 at late times . in this free field theory",
    "there is no scattering between the created particles , and a ` normal ' equation of state can not be established .",
    "the form of the equation of state is expected to change as soon as interactions are introduced , no matter how weak , since the particles have a finite density and an unlimited interval of time to interact .",
    "next we consider the massless cases ( @xmath216 ) for both conformal ( @xmath285 ) and minimal ( @xmath286 ) couplings .",
    "as already remarked , in the conformal case there is no particle creation at all , so the energy and pressure remain strictly constant and agree with that of the bunch - davies vacuum  @xcite given by @xmath287 which corresponds to the value of the anomalous trace .    the results for the massless , minimally coupled field are shown in figs .",
    "[ phi2 ] and [ tensor00 ] .",
    "we point out the fact that the renormalized value of @xmath288 grows linearly in time with a slope of @xmath289 , that is independent of the initial conditions  @xcite .",
    "notice that for the massless , minimally coupled case the late time behavior of the renormalized energy , trace , and pressure are determined by the value given in reference  @xcite , and it does _ not _ go to the value calculated in reference  @xcite .",
    "this difference can be understood as a finite additional term that must be added to the bunch - davies result when the spatially homogeneous @xmath57 mode is handled properly .",
    "it is interesting to study the case of the exactly massless , minimally coupled scalar field for a wider variety of initial conditions .",
    "if a non - zero number of particles @xmath83 in a finite number of modes is added , the asymptotic values of the renormalized @xmath1 still approaches the de sitter invariant value  @xcite @xmath290 even though the initial state and transient behavior in those cases ( non - vacuum initial conditions ) are not de sitter invariant .",
    "the fact that in all the above cases , even for de sitter non - invariant initial conditions and even for the massless , minimally coupled field , the total renormalized energy - momentum tensor goes to the de sitter form , @xmath291 constant , is an important general conclusion of our study .",
    "qualitatively , one can understand this result in the following way . at late times , @xmath292 , @xmath173 grows exponentially in de sitter spacetime , and a very large number of modes have wavenumber @xmath293 , _",
    "i.e. , _ physical wavelengths that have been redshifted out of the de sitter horizon and frozen out . those wavenumbers for which @xmath55 is still greater than @xmath173 behave like adiabatic vacuum modes and are removed by the subtraction procedure .",
    "hence the sums ( integrals ) over @xmath55 in the renormalized energy - momentum tensor are cut off at @xmath294 of order @xmath173 .",
    "since the initial conditions differ from the de sitter invariant vacuum data only for some finite set of wavenumbers @xmath295 ( say ) , these small wavenumbers make a decreasingly small contribution to the mode sum , which is controlled by the wide band of wavenumbers for which @xmath296 .",
    "the summand ( integrand ) in this wide @xmath55 band appearing in the energy density , pressure or trace is a function only of physical wavenumber @xmath297 ( since it is independent of the initial data ) . examining the behavior of the mode functions for late times and expanding the integrand in @xmath160 or @xmath185 in powers of physical momentum",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath298 hence all terms in the summand which do not grow faster than @xmath233 for large @xmath173 yield a constant contribution to @xmath8 in the late time limit , independent of the initial data .",
    "the largest power @xmath234 which can occur in the mode sums for @xmath160 and @xmath185 is controlled by the behavior of the mode functions @xmath79 at late times .",
    "referring back to eqs .",
    "( [ modefns ] ) and ( [ bigom ] ) it is clear that the late time behavior of @xmath63 is oscillatory , @xmath299 for @xmath300 but exponential , @xmath301 for @xmath302 . since @xmath7 is bilinear in the mode functions",
    "the power @xmath234 can be as large as @xmath303 for @xmath281 pure imaginary .",
    "provided @xmath304 , all @xmath305 , and the exponential behavior can not overcome the normal kinematic redshift @xmath306 , there are no extreme infrared singular terms in the summand , and we conclude from ( [ asympn ] ) that both @xmath160 and @xmath185 should tend asymptotically to a constant , independent of the initial data at late times . by the covariant conservation equation ( [ cons ] ) for the renormalized @xmath8 this implies the de sitter equation of state @xmath307 at late times , which is precisely what the numerical results show .",
    "conversely , if @xmath308 , we should expect the integrals for the finite renormalized energy density and pressure of the scalar field to contain terms with @xmath309 and to grow with the scale factor like @xmath310  @xcite .",
    "details of this case and the analytic calculation of this behavior will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath311 is marginal . for this value of @xmath312 the power @xmath233 is possible ( but not required ) in the mode sum .",
    "if present , it leads to a logarithm , @xmath313 and linear growth in cosmic time for the components of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "one has to examine the energy - momentum tensor in more detail to determine if such logarithmic behavior exists or not , as a general argument based on the asymptotics of the mode equation ( [ modefns ] ) will not suffice . in the adiabatic ` vacuum ' and",
    "matter contributions separately we observe this linear growth for the massless , minimally coupled scalar .",
    "this behavior of the ` vacuum ' component is easily understood from the asymptotic forms of the functions @xmath90 and @xmath110 in ( [ mmc ] ) in the massless , minimally coupled case , since they imply that @xmath314 for @xmath293 .",
    "this is the marginal @xmath233 power behavior which leads to a linear growth ( for the energy density of the vacuum contribution ) in comoving time with slope @xmath315 .",
    "however , it turns out that for the exactly massless , minimally coupled case ( @xmath316 ) the complete , vacuum _ plus _ particle , renormalized energy and pressure do not have such @xmath233 logarithmic divergences , as our numerical studies show . in this case",
    "there is an exactly compensating growth in the matter contribution which cancels the vacuum piece .",
    "this cancellation is a consequence of the exact field translational symmetry ( @xmath317 ) in the massless , minimally coupled case which prevents a term proportional to @xmath318 from appearing in @xmath1 .",
    "next we consider @xmath311 , _",
    "@xmath319 , with @xmath14 and @xmath4 separately different from zero , which has the same mode equation but no such symmetry under field translations . because the energy - momentum tensor ( [ ttij ] ) depends on @xmath14 and @xmath4 in distinctly different ways , in these cases",
    "there is a generic term proportional to @xmath318 in @xmath160 and @xmath185 , and hence the exact cancellation of the linear growth in @xmath16 between vacuum and particle contributions no longer occurs .",
    "total _ energy - momentum tensor now grows logarithmically with @xmath173 or linearly with @xmath16 in de sitter space .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ nu32 ] .",
    "the coefficients of this linear growth can be determined analytically from the known behavior of @xmath318 , namely @xmath320 with the constants @xmath321 and @xmath322 constrained by the conservation equation ( [ cons ] ) to obey @xmath323 and the constant @xmath324 determined by the equation @xmath325 hence for @xmath326 ( and @xmath327 ) this linear growth decreases the effective cosmological constant over time , whereas for @xmath328 ( and @xmath329 ) it increases it . in either case",
    "the backreaction of the scalar quantum field can not be neglected at late times .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this linearly growing behavior carries over to the physically more relevant case of one - loop metric fluctuations themselves , and if so with which sign .    finally , it is interesting to study the case of minimal coupling and non - vanishing but small real mass . in this case",
    "there are two time scales : a short time scale on which the allen - folacci vacuum is approached , and a longer time scale controlled by @xmath330 on which there is a smooth transition to the bunch - davies vacuum .",
    "details of this case and a reliable analytic calculation of the behavior observed will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we have presented a general method to study the initial value problem of a quantum field in a frw spacetime .",
    "the two basic ingredients are : an initial adiabatic state ( of order four ) , and an adiabatic number basis , with respect to which we define a particle number .",
    "this basis allows one to write the bare energy - momentum tensor as a sum of two contributions : a vacuum polarization term , and a particle production term .",
    "the advantage of the basis presented here is that the non - universal power law divergences of @xmath8 are isolated in the vacuum polarization piece , and the matter contribution displays physically reasonable behavior , as evidenced by the particle creation process in de sitter space .",
    "we have implemented a numerical scheme incorporating this theoretical approach which preserves the covariant conservation of @xmath8 , and yields a renormalized @xmath8 which is cutoff independent .",
    "the numerical results for a de sitter background can be summarized as follows . for the case of large mass",
    "( @xmath331 ) particle production takes place at horizon crossing , and the late time behavior of the renormalized energy - momentum tensor agrees with that of the bunch - davies vacuum . in the conformally invariant case ( @xmath332 ) there is no particle production , and the renormalized value of the energy - momentum tensor corresponds to the well - known trace anomaly .",
    "the massless minimally coupled field ( @xmath333 ) appears to be a marginal case .",
    "non - de sitter invariant initial conditions are driven to the allen - folacci vacuum , and not to the bunch - davies vacuum . in none of the above cases does @xmath8 vanish for late times , that is , it is not red - shifted away due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "backreaction effects , though not required by this behavior can not be ruled out when higher order corrections due to self - interactions or fluctuations in the background metric are included . finally , for @xmath334 , but @xmath14 and @xmath4 individually different from zero , the total energy density , trace , and pressure of a free scalar field grow without bound , logarithmically with the scale factor .",
    "in this case it is certain that backreaction effects must be included self - consistently , since the energy density and pressure must eventually grow large enough to influence the background geometry and invalidate the test field approximation .",
    "we believe that these results merit a fuller investigation of the effects of self - interactions and quantized gravitational fluctuations in a complete backreaction calculation .",
    "with respect to the latter , an interesting extension of the present study of free scalar field theory would be to the second order energy - momentum tensor of quantized metric fluctuations themselves . barring a special cancellation which occurs in the @xmath335 scalar case",
    ", we may expect that this energy - momentum tensor would contain terms which grow logarithmically with the scale factor , and dynamically influence the evolution of the mean geometry away from de sitter space , as has been suggested by general arguments some time ago  @xcite .",
    "the generalization to fully self - interacting fields is another interesting direction to pursue , since one would again expect the interactions to alter the de sitter equation of state found in our study of the asymptotic behavior of massive fields .",
    "the formalism presented in this paper is intended to serve as a foundation from which the detailed analyses of these issues can begin , and the general backreaction problem in cosmological spacetimes with arbitrary finite adiabatic initial data can be posed and solved numerically .",
    "these extensions , applications to specific cosmological models , and the generation of density perturbations in the early universe are under current study .",
    "the authors wish to express their gratitude to paul anderson for his incisive comments on the manuscript and endless hours of fruitful discussion .",
    "numerical computations were performed on the t3e at the national energy research scientific computing center ( nersc ) at lawrence berkeley national laboratory ( lbnl ) .",
    "because of the loss of explicit covariance under time reparameterizations in the adiabatic regularization procedure , we establish in this appendix the relationship between the adiabatic expansions in two different , commonly used time coordinates , namely conformal time @xmath21 and the comoving time @xmath16 employed in the present work .",
    "we will show that the two adiabatic expansions ( comoving and conformal ) give identical results for physical quantities such as @xmath8 to any order in the expansion .",
    "the relation between the two time coordinates is given by ( [ conftim ] ) of the text .",
    "we denote a derivative with respect to comoving time by a dot , and a derivative with respect to conformal time by a prime .",
    "if we define the conformal mode functions by the relation , @xmath336 then the mode equation ( [ modefns ] ) in comoving time implies the mode equation , @xmath337 with @xmath338 in conformal time . hence the zeroth order adiabatic frequency for the adiabatic expansion in conformal time is @xmath339 times the zeroth adiabatic frequency for the adiabatic expansion in comoving time , @xmath340 . we will now show that this feature holds to any adiabatic order .",
    "since the mode equations , ( [ etamode ] ) or ( [ modefns ] ) , both have the standard form of a time dependent harmonic oscillator equation , the adiabatic ansatz , @xmath341}^{1/2 } } }   { \\rm exp}\\left[-i{\\int^{\\eta } { \\mathrm{d } } \\eta ' \\upsilon_k(\\eta')}\\right ]   \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] leads to an equation for @xmath342 in conformal time , @xmath343 which is exactly of the same form as that in comoving time , upon replacing @xmath344 by @xmath90 , and @xmath345 by @xmath346 , _",
    "@xmath347 to zeroth adiabatic order we have established already that @xmath348 let us now assume that this result is true at adiabatic order @xmath349 , _",

    "an immediate corollary of this result is that any quantity such as the energy density and pressure , developed up to a given adiabatic order @xmath137 in the comoving time coordinate @xmath16 corresponds exactly to the same quantity developed up to the same adiabatic order @xmath137 in any other time coordinate @xmath356 .",
    "since @xmath199 transforms as a tensor , the energy density and pressure transform as @xmath361 under ( [ ttrans ] ) .",
    "hence up to the overall factor of @xmath362 in the first of these relations , the energy density and pressure in either time coordinate are numerically equal at any order of the adiabatic expansion , and the renormalization procedure of subtracting the expansion up to adiabatic order two or four from the bare quantities is the _ same _ procedure in any time coordinate .",
    "the case @xmath363 and @xmath364 , relating conformal time to comoving time , is just a special case of this much more general result , so that the conformal adiabatic expansion which has been given , for example , in  @xcite is exactly equivalent to the corresponding expansion in comoving time given by eqns .",
    "( [ adbtwo ] ) and ( [ adbfour ] ) of the text , as may be checked by explicit comparison of the two sets of expressions .",
    "hence the subtraction of the adiabatic order two expressions ( [ ettwo ] ) from the bare energy density and pressure corresponds exactly to the same subtraction in conformal ( or any other ) time coordinate which leaves the spatial sections unchanged .",
    "finally , since the fourth order logarithmic cutoff dependence of @xmath8 is proportional to the geometric tensor @xmath190 , this remaining cutoff dependence and the argument ( given in the text ) for how to handle it in backreaction calculations , applies equally well in any time coordinate .",

    "<S> 1 pc    we present a general formulation of the time - dependent initial value problem for a quantum scalar field of arbitrary mass and curvature coupling in a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmological model . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce an adiabatic number basis which has the virtue that the divergent parts of the quantum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath0 are isolated in the vacuum piece of @xmath0 , and may be removed using adiabatic subtraction . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting renormalized @xmath1 is conserved , independent of the cutoff , and has a physically transparent , quasiclassical form in terms of the average number of created adiabatic ` particles ' . by analyzing the evolution of the adiabatic particle number in de sitter spacetime we exhibit the time structure of the particle creation process , which can be understood in terms of the time at which different momentum scales enter the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> a numerical scheme to compute @xmath2 as a function of time with arbitrary adiabatic initial states ( not necessarily de sitter invariant ) is described . for minimally coupled , massless fields , at late times the renormalized @xmath1 goes asymptotically to the de sitter invariant state previously found by allen and folacci , and not to the zero mass limit of the bunch - davies vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> if the mass @xmath3 and the curvature coupling @xmath4 differ from zero , but satisfy @xmath5 , the energy density and pressure of the scalar field grow linearly in cosmic time demonstrating that , at least in this case , backreaction effects become significant and can not be neglected in de sitter spacetime .    </S>",
