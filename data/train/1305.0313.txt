    "the theory of cosmic inflation @xcite , advanced to solve the cosmological horizon and flatness problems , also explains the initial fluctuations which later gave rise to galaxies and large - scale structure in the universe . while inflation generically predicts initial matter density fluctuations with an approximately gaussian random distribution , the small deviations from gaussianity that characterize different inflation models",
    "have been suggested to provide an observational probe to test and distinguish the models .",
    "while purely gaussian initial density fluctuations are fully described by their power spectrum , primordial non - gaussianity ( png ) requires higher - order statistics to characterize it , the lowest - order being the 3-point correlation function , or its fourier transform  the bispectrum  which is zero for the gaussian case .",
    "henceforth , we will describe the level of png predicted by different inflation models in terms of this bispectrum as parametrized by the dimensionless `` nonlinearity parameter '' @xmath3 , specialized to the case of the so - called `` local '' template .",

    "observational cosmology has made important progress in constraining png thus far .",
    "recent measurement of the cmb anisotropy bispectrum by _ planck _ has placed the most stringent constraint so far , @xmath8 @xcite . since",
    ", even in the ideal noise - free limit , cmb temperature ( temperature+polarization ) measurements can only reduce the error to @xmath9 @xcite , there is great interest in finding other methods to measure png ; if future observations still do not detect png , an error budget @xmath10 will be necessary to rule out non - standard inflationary models conclusively .",
    "[ henceforth , we focus on this `` local '' template and remove the label `` local '' . ]",
    "png affects the clustering of the early star - forming galactic halos responsible for creating a network of ionized patches in the surrounding intergalactic medium ( igm ) during the epoch of reionization ( eor ) , which leaves a png imprint on the tomographic mapping of neutral hydrogen in the igm using its redshifted 21  cm radiation .",
    "we shall here investigate in detail the prospects for constraining png with radio interferometric 21  cm measurements .",

    "can be used to combine multi - frequency measurements because it fixes the reionization history ( and therefore @xmath72 ) for a given ( @xmath0 , @xmath39 ) .",
    "we show multi - epoch constraints from the esmr in table  [ tab:1sigall ] .",
    "specifically , if information is combined from @xmath73 ( 7-band , total 42  mhz bandwidth , corresponding to @xmath74 in the esmr ) , the constraint can be significantly tightened , i.e.  @xmath75 for omniscope ( 10  times smaller than an ideal cmb experiment ) , and @xmath76 by ska ( two times smaller than _ planck _ ) .",

    "cmb measurements@xcite corresponds to a prior of @xmath78 , much larger than allowed by ska and omniscope alone , so adding this @xmath79 prior can not improve @xmath80 from these experiments .",
    "if we take a more conservative upper limit , @xmath81 ( instead of @xmath82 as assumed above ) , then @xmath80 for omniscope is @xmath83 times larger . since multi - epoch observations tighten @xmath0 constraints by combining information from different frequency bands to increase the amount of data relative to a single band , our use of the simple esmr model here , with constant efficiency parameter @xmath39 , for which reionization spans a relatively narrow range of redshift , may be a conservative one .",

    "our results differ for a number of reasons : ( 1 ) ref.@xcite computed the scale - dependent signature of png in @xmath72 by fitting their approximate semi - numerical simulations of reionization . in ref.@xcite",
    ", we showed by our analytical derivation and numerical lptr calculations that this fit underestimates the scale - dependent bias due to png significantly .",

    "( 2 ) the anticipated mwa512 configuration assumed by ref .",
    "@xcite was also overly optimistic , while we adopt the current mwa128 configuration @xcite .    to model the effect of png on the 21  cm power spectrum , ref .",
    "@xcite assumed the simple functional dependence of ionized fraction on local overdensity , used for illustrative purposes by ref .",
    "@xcite for the gaussian case , to derive an ionized fraction bias @xmath85 for png .",
    "unfortunately , they incorrectly used @xmath85 to relate the 21  cm power spectrum to the matter power spectrum ( see ref .",
    "this paper suggests two approaches to constrain @xmath0 with 21  cm power spectra from the eor .",
    "if we take a conservative approach , i.e.  assuming nothing about @xmath20 and @xmath86 , then the pheno - model can be employed for a single redshift bin to provide @xmath0 constraints with the same precision as a reionization model in which the reionization history is uniquely specified by a set of model parameters . however , using the esmr , we demonstrate that a well - motivated reionization model can improve @xmath80 in two ways : ( 1 ) a pathfinder measurement at a single redshift can best - fit the values of model parameters , which then can be used to estimate the desired redshift corresponding to @xmath87 , i.e. the `` sweet spot '' for cosmic - variance - dominated experiments .",
    "this can help tune _ single - epoch _",
    "observations for maximum precision .",
    "( 2 ) _ multi - epoch _ measurements can be combined to improve @xmath80 .",
    "we find that multi - frequency observation by ska can achieve @xmath1 , providing a new method to constrain png independent of cmb measurements , but with a precision comparable to _ planck _ s .",
    "a cosmic - variance - limited array of this size like _ omniscope _ can achieve @xmath2 , improving current constraints by an order of magnitude .",
