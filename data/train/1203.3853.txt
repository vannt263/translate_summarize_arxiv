    "this shall serve as motivation to study similar estimates for perturbations of the wave equation by lower order terms and outline strategies to be pursued .",
    "we will recall some well - known properties of solutions to the cauchy problem for the wave equation @xmath0 in @xmath1 .",
    "we assume for simplicity that data belong to @xmath2 . a simple integration by parts argument allows to show that solutions possess a cone of dependence property and are therefore also compactly supported for all fixed times @xmath3 .",
    "we will not make this argument rigorous , but point out that by the same reason the total energy defined as @xmath4 is preserved , @xmath5    this preserved energy is spread out ( uniformly ) over a region increasing in time .",

    "dispersive estimates are much harder to prove than energy estimates as they encode structural information about the representation of solutions .",
    "we will collect some of the crucial ingredients of their proof in this introductory section .      of particular importance for us",
    "are equations with constant coefficients as they can be solved explicitly in terms of the fourier transform and serve as important model examples .",
    "we keep it as simply and sketchy as possible to not extend the exposition too much .",

    "gordon equation @xmath15 natural questions to ask for these problems are :    1 .",
    "what are reasonable energies to estimate ?",
    "while for the damped wave equation @xmath16 is a good candidate , we need to include @xmath17 itself into the energy term for the klein ",
    "gordon equation .",
    "then the klein ",
    "gordon energy is preserved , while for the damped wave equation we obtain @xmath18 and the ( wave ) energy decreases .",
    "2 .   what are sharp ( decay )",
    "rates for the energy ?",
    "this is of interest for the damped wave equation and the answer is by no means trivial .",
    "it heavily depends on the assumptions made for data , see e.g. the work of ikehata @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for some examples of this .",
    "the obvious estimate @xmath19 is sharp for the damped wave equation with arbitrary data from the energy space .",

    "4 .   are there other asymptotic representations for solutions ?",
    "as example we refer to nishihara @xcite for an asymptotic description of solutions to the damped wave equation in terms of solutions of an associated heat equation and some exponentially decaying free waves .",
    "we will come back to some of these questions for more general hyperbolic models in the subsequent sections .",
    "an extensive study of higher order hyperbolic equations with constant coefficients and their dispersive estimates was done in ruzhansky ",
    "smith @xcite , we restrict ourselves here in this informal introductory part to the wave equation . solutions in @xmath23 can be studied in terms of the partial fourier transform with respect to the @xmath24-variable .",
    "this gives the parameter - dependent ordinary differential equation @xmath25 with solutions explicitly given as @xmath26 estimates in @xmath27-scale can be obtained immediately from plancherel identity",

    "the proof is straightforward from .",
    "the solutions to the cauchy problem satisfy the a priori estimate @xmath28 together with @xmath29 for all @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the proof of the dispersive estimates of theorem  [ thm:1:dispest ] are based on the representation of solutions as sum of fourier integrals @xmath33 with amplitudes @xmath34 supported in @xmath35 and an ( easy to obtain ) better estimate for the remainder term localised to @xmath36 . a dyadic decomposition of frequency space is used to reduce this to integrals over spherical shells in @xmath37 and they are treated by means of usually stationary phase estimates .",
    "we will conclude this introductory section by reviewing some estimates for fourier transforms of surface carried measures and relate them to estimates for fourier integrals .",
    "such estimates have a rather long history and go back to the original work of van der corput @xcite , @xcite , hlawka @xcite , @xcite , randol @xcite and in particular for applications in hyperbolic partial differential equations strichartz @xcite , @xcite and littman @xcite .",
    "later , sugimoto @xcite , @xcite , established further decay rates depending on the geometry of the level sets of the phase , in the analytic case , introducing notions of convex and non - convex indices in this context .",
    "we will rely on further extension of these by ruzhansky @xcite , @xcite , allowing phases and amplitudes of limited regularity and depending on parameters , with uniform estimates with the respect to parameter , bridging the gap between the van der corput lemma and the stationary phase method .",
    "let @xmath38 be a smooth closed hypersurface embedded in @xmath39 .",
    "we assume first that @xmath38 encloses a convex domain of @xmath39 , which is in particular the case if the gaussian curvature of @xmath38 is non - vanishing .",
    "let further @xmath40 be a smooth function defined on the surface @xmath38 .",
    "in a first step we are interested in decay properties of the inverse fourier transform @xmath41 the integral taken with respect to the surface measure induced from the ambient lebesgue measure . before stating the result , we introduce the contact index @xmath42 of the surface @xmath38 to be the maximal order of contact between @xmath38 and its tangent lines . for a 2-plane @xmath43 containing the normal of the surface",
    "@xmath38 at @xmath44 we define @xmath45 to be the order of contact between the tangent @xmath46 and the curve @xmath47 in the point @xmath48 .",
    "consequently , we set @xmath49 then the following result is valid .",
    "[ lem:1:sug1 ] assume @xmath38 is convex .",
    "then the estimate @xmath50 is valid for all @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "this result is closely related to the following multiplier theorem which we formulate in the form due to ruzhansky @xcite ( see also ruzhansky  smith @xcite and sugimoto @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath53 be an excision function , i.e. , we assume it is equal to @xmath54 for large @xmath55 and vanishes near the origin .",
    "we then consider the operator @xmath56 for a given real - valued phase function @xmath57 being positively homogeneous @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "the @xmath60@xmath61-boundedness of such an operator is related to the geometry of the fresnel surface / level set @xmath62 it is sufficient to prove the limit case for @xmath63 , boundedness between dual lebesgue spaces follows by interpolation with the ( obvious ) boundedness in @xmath64 .",
    "first we recall the definition of besov spaces .",
    "let @xmath65 define a littlewood  paley decomposition , i.e. , be such that @xmath66 for any @xmath67 .",
    "then the homogeneous besov norm of regularity @xmath68 and with lebesgue - indices @xmath69 $ ] is defined by @xmath70 while the besov space @xmath71 contains all functions with @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "it follows @xmath74 and there are continuous embeddings @xmath75 for @xmath76 and similarly @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "the opposite embeddings require to pay a small amount of regularity ( see runst  sickel @xcite for more details ) .",
    "[ lem:1:sug1a ] assume that @xmath38 defined by is convex .",
    "then @xmath79 is a bounded operator mapping @xmath80 for all @xmath81 .",
    "the statement of this lemma immediately implies dispersive type estimates for fourier integral representations of the form @xmath82 indeed , by rescaling @xmath83 , @xmath84 , we see that @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "the above estimate is of interest to us because solves the cauchy problem @xmath87 generalising . here and later on",
    "we use the notation @xmath88 $ ] for fourier multipliers .",
    "in general there is no reason for the fresnel surface of a phase to be convex .",
    "of particular importance for the study of hyperbolic systems arising in crystal acoustics or elasticity theory or for higher order scalar equations are generalisations of the lemmata  [ lem:1:sug1 ] and [ lem:1:sug1a ] to non - convex surfaces .",
    "to consider this situation , we define the non - convex contact index @xmath89 as maximal order of minimal contact .",
    "the replacement to lemma  [ lem:1:sug1 ] is    [ lem:1:sug2 ] for general ( non - convex ) surfaces @xmath38 the estimate @xmath90 is valid for all @xmath91 .",
    "again we obtain a multiplier theorem for the operator @xmath79 defined in .",
    "[ lem:1:sug2a ] the operator @xmath79 is bounded @xmath80 for @xmath92 .",
    "later on in section  [ sec:3:dispersive ] we will generalise the above estimates to include phase functions depending on both @xmath3 and @xmath24-variables suitable for the treatment of more general hyperbolic equations .",
    "before we pursue the analysis of equations and systems with time - dependent coefficients it is instructive to understand what happens in the case of equations with constant coefficients .",
    "one of the very helpful observations available in this case is that after a fourier transform in the spatial variable @xmath24 we obtain an ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients which can be solved almost explicitly once we know its characteristics .",
    "this works well for frequencies where the characteristics are simple .",
    "if they become multiple , the representation breaks down and other methods are required . in the presentation of this part we follow @xcite to which we refer for the detailed arguments and complete proofs of the material in this section .",
    "let us consider the cauchy problem for a general scalar strictly hyperbolic operator with constant coefficients , @xmath93 the symbol @xmath94 of the operator @xmath95 is assumed to be a homogeneous polynomial of order @xmath96 , and the @xmath97 are ( complex ) constants .",
    "we denote by @xmath98 and @xmath99 the operator in and its principal part , respectively , @xmath100 we denote by @xmath101 and @xmath102 , @xmath103 , the characteristic roots of @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively . hence , we write @xmath106 the strict hyperbolicity of @xmath98 means that the functions @xmath101 are real and distinct , for all @xmath107 .",
    "it follows that @xmath108 and that the @xmath109 are positively homogeneous of order one , @xmath110 for all @xmath111 and @xmath107 .    in the general analysis",
    "it is usually desirable to have conditions on the lower order terms for different rates of decay of solutions to .",
    "however , it is more convenient to prove the results making assumptions on the characteristic roots . some results deducing properties of characteristics from properties of coefficients are available , and we refer to @xcite for some details in this direction .",
    "it is natural to impose a stability condition excluding an exponential growth of solutions in time .",
    "namely , we assume that for all @xmath112 we have that @xmath113 in fact , certain microlocal decay estimates are possible even without this condition if the supports of the fourier transforms of the cauchy data are contained in the set where condition holds .",
    "however , this restriction is only technical so we may assume without great loss of generality since otherwise no time decay of solutions can be expected , which becomes clear from the following representation of solutions .      by taking the fourier transform of with respect to @xmath24 , solving the resulting ordinary differential equation , and taking the inverse fourier transform",
    ", we obtain that the solution to the cauchy problem can be written in the form @xmath114 where the propagators @xmath115 are defined by @xmath116 with suitable amplitudes @xmath117 .",
    "more precisely , for each @xmath118 and @xmath96 , the functions @xmath117 are actually independent of @xmath3 on the set of simple characteristics @xmath119 for these @xmath120 , we have    [ lem : ordercoeff ] for @xmath121 we have @xmath122 where @xmath123 means sum over the range indicated excluding @xmath118 .",
    "furthermore , for each @xmath124 , and @xmath125 , we have that the amplitude @xmath120 is smooth in  @xmath126 and @xmath127    it turns out that it is sensible to divide the considerations of how characteristic roots behave into two parts : their behaviour for large values of @xmath55 and for bounded values of @xmath55 .",
    "the reason is that the large time behaviour of solutions of is governed by the properties of characteristics @xmath128 of the full equation . in turn , these are similar to those of @xmath109 for large @xmath55 .",
    "it turns out that the key properties of characteristics to consider are    * the behaviour for large frequencies in which case the roots @xmath128 must be distinct ; * the multiplicities of roots ( this only occurs for bounded frequencies ) ; * whether roots lie on the real axis or are separated from it ; * how roots meet the real axis ( if they do ) ; * the properties of the hessian of the roots , @xmath129 ; * convexity - type conditions guaranteeing better decay rates .    for frequencies away from multiplicities",
    "we can actually establish estimates for the corresponding oscillatory integrals that contribute to the solution in .",
    "around multiplicities we need to take extra care of the structure of solutions .",
    "this can be done by dividing the frequencies into zones each of which will give a certain decay rate .",
    "combined together they yield the total decay rate for solution to .",
    "we now state the summarised result as it appeared in @xcite .",
    "[ thm : overallmainthm ] suppose @xmath130 is the solution of the @xmath131 order linear , constant coefficient , strictly hyperbolic cauchy problem  .",

    "+ @xmath142 this is the @xmath143 rate in a shrinking region ; see @xcite for the details .",
    "then , with @xmath144 , the following estimate holds @xmath145 where @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 is a constant depending upon  @xmath149 and  @xmath7 .",
    "let us now briefly explain how to understand these tables . since the decay rates do depend on the behaviour of characteristic roots in different regions , in theorem [ thm : overallmainthm ] we single out properties which determine the final decay rate .",
    "since the same characteristic root , say @xmath128 , may exhibit different properties in different regions , we look at the corresponding rates @xmath150 under each possible condition and then take the slowest one for the final answer .",
    "the value of the sobolev index @xmath148 depends on the regions as well , and it can be found from the relevant microlocal statements that exist for each region .    in conditions of part",
    "i of the theorem , it can be shown by perturbation arguments that only three cases are possible for large @xmath37 , namely , the characteristic root may be uniformly separated from the real axis , it may lie on the axis , or it may converge to the real axis at infinity . if , for example , the root lies on the axis and , in addition , it satisfies the convexity condition with index @xmath151 , we get the corresponding decay rate @xmath152 . indices @xmath151 and @xmath153 in the tables are defined as the maximum of the corresponding indices @xmath154 and @xmath155 , respectively , where @xmath156 , over all @xmath118 and over all @xmath157 , for which @xmath37 lies in the corresponding region .",
    "the indices @xmath154 and @xmath155 are those defined in section [ sec:1:statphas ] .    the statement in part ii is more involved since we may have multiple roots intersecting on rather irregular sets .",
    "the number @xmath105 of coinciding roots corresponds to the number of roots which actually contribute to the loss of regularity .",
    "for example , operator @xmath158 would have @xmath159 for both pairs of roots @xmath160 and @xmath161 , intersecting at the origin . meeting",
    "the axis with finite order @xmath162 means that we have the estimate @xmath163 for all the intersecting roots , where @xmath164 in part ii of theorem [ thm : overallmainthm ] , the condition that @xmath105 roots meet the axis with finite order @xmath162 on a set of codimension @xmath165 means that all these estimates hold and that there is a ( @xmath166 ) set @xmath167 of codimension @xmath165 such that @xmath168 for all corresponding @xmath118 .",
    "in part ii of the theorem , condition @xmath142 is formulated in the region of the size decreasing with time : if we have @xmath105 multiple roots which coincide on the real axis on a set @xmath167 of codimension @xmath165 , we have an estimate @xmath169 if we cut off the fourier transforms of the cauchy data to the @xmath170-neighbourhood @xmath171 of @xmath167 with @xmath172 . here",
    "we may relax the definition of the intersection above and say that if @xmath105 roots coincide in a set @xmath167 , then they coincide on a set of codimension @xmath165 if the measure of the @xmath170-neighbourhood @xmath171 of @xmath167 satisfies @xmath173 for small @xmath174 ; here @xmath175    we can then combine this with the remaining cases outside of this neighbourhood , where it is possible to establish decay by different arguments .",
    "in particular , this is the case of homogeneous equations with roots intersecting at the origin .",
    "however , one sometimes needs to introduce special norms to handle @xmath27-estimates around the multiplicities .",
    "we leave this outside the scope of this review , and refer to @xcite for further details , as well as for microlocal improvements of some of the estimates under certain more refined assumptions .      here",

    "the considerations of the generalised energy conservation property in section  [ sec:3:solvdiag ] were inspired by the work of hirosawa , @xcite and later joint work with him , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "main question arising there is to what extent symbolic conditions on coefficients can be weakened without loosing uniform bounds on the energy .",
    "as the presented results are sharp , weaker estimates for derivatives have to be compensated by additional stabilisation conditions",
