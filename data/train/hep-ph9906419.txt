    "one of the most important challenges facing the next generation of accelerators is the untangling of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking . in the optimistic scenario where a higgs boson is discovered at lep2 , the tevatron , or the lhc , a major goal of a high energy",
    "@xmath9 collider becomes the measurement of the higgs boson couplings to the fermions and gauge bosons .",
    "these couplings are uniquely predicted in the standard model ( sm ) , but can be significantly different in extentions such as supersymmetric models .",
    "a measurement of the higgs couplings can therefore discriminate between various alternatives to the standard model .",
    "the couplings of the higgs boson to the gauge bosons can be measured in a straightforward manner through the associated production processes , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , and through vector boson fusion , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the couplings of the higgs boson to fermions are more difficult to measure , however . in the standard model ,",
    "the fermion - higgs boson couplings are completely determined in terms of the fermion masses . for a generic quark , @xmath17 ,",
    "the @xmath18 coupling is given by ,    _",
    "q =- m_qv , [ yuk ]    where @xmath19 and so the top quark - higgs boson yukawa coupling is much larger than any other yukawa coupling .    the process @xmath20 provides a direct mechanism for measuring the top quark - higgs yukawa coupling@xcite .",
    "this process proceeds mainly via @xmath21 and @xmath22 exchange , with the higgs boson radiated from the top quark .",
    "this contribution is directly proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "there is also a contribution from the higgs boson coupling to the exchanged @xmath22 , but this contribution is subdominant and so does not upset the interpretation of the @xmath24 process as a measurement of the top quark - higgs boson yukawa coupling .    at a high energy @xmath9 collider with @xmath25  gev ,",
    "the process @xmath24 is sensitive to higgs bosons in the mass region @xmath26 .",
    "the current limit on @xmath27 from lep2 is @xmath28  gev@xcite .",
    "this higgs mass regime is favored by calculations comparing precision electroweak data to standard model predictions@xcite .",
    "in addition , the lightest higgs boson of supersymmetric models ( which for many models behaves indistinguishably from the sm higgs boson ) ought to have mass less than typically 130  gev@xcite .",
    "in the interesting @xmath29 mass region , the higgs boson will decay predominantly to @xmath30 pairs and so the final state of interest will be @xmath31 .",
    "since the top quark decays to a @xmath7 boson and a @xmath8 quark , the final state will contain at least four @xmath8-quarks plus two @xmath7 bosons .",
    "although the rate is small ( on the order of a few femtobarns ) , the signature is quite spectacular .",
    "there are two major sources of background to the @xmath31 final state@xcite .",
    "there is a large qcd background , coming primarily from the process @xmath32 , with the gluon decaying to a @xmath30 pair .",
    "the @xmath30 pairs resulting from the gluon splitting tend to peak at low values of the @xmath30 invariant mass .",
    "there is also an electroweak ( ew ) background , of which the dominant contribution is @xmath33 .",
    "although the ew background is formally smaller than the qcd background , it is more problematic since the @xmath34 decay resonates in close proximity to the expected higgs signal .",
    "we compute these backgrounds and estimate the resulting precision which can be obtained on @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath35 cross section for @xmath36 has been calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we work entirely with tree level cross sections , for consistency with the background predictions .",
    "the dominant effect of qcd corrections will be to increase the precision of signal and background total cross section calculations , so that results from this paper can be appropriately rescaled once the qcd corrected background rates are available .",
    "recently , moretti has presented parton - level calculations of both signal and background processes for the semileptonic final state  @xcite .",
    "we have confirmed both his signal and background results at the parton level . in this paper , we extend our programs to include parton showering , hadronization and particle decays .",
    "we consider both the semileptonic final state    @xmath37    and the fully hadronic final state @xmath38 in our approach , we rely on a full reconstruction of the various top quark , @xmath7-boson and higgs boson invariant masses in the events , which should lend confidence that the appropriate signal and background processes are in fact being seen .",
    "similar analyses of top quark yukawa coupling measurements have recently been presented at conferences . a recent analysis of signal and background for @xmath39",
    "production and decay for both semileptonic and hadronic channels has been presented by juste and merino using a neural net approach  @xcite .",
    "an independent analysis is also being carried out by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the associated @xmath40 process ( for @xmath41 ) is also of interest in supersymmetric models@xcite . in such models , there are five higgs bosons , @xmath42 , which can be produced and the couplings of the higgs bosons may differ significantly from those of the standard model . in particular , the coupling of at least one of the higgs bosons to the @xmath8 quark may be enhanced .",
    "in addition , because of the tri - linear coupling of the higgs bosons to a scalar and a pseudoscalar , in such models the @xmath43 production receives large resonance contributions not present in the standard model . these models offer a rich phenomenology , but will not be considered here .    in this report ,",
    "section [ sec : calculation ] contains a description of some of our calculational details .",
    "section [ sec : results_500 ] presents results for a linear @xmath9 collider operating at @xmath44 , while section [ sec : results_1000 ] shows corresponding results for @xmath45  tev . in section [ sec : conclusions ] , we present a discussion and some conclusions .",
    "the starting point for our signal and background calculations is the calculation of the corresponding squared matrix elements for the relevant subprocesses . for these ,",
    "we use the computer program madgraph@xcite and the helas subroutines@xcite .",
    "we compute : @xmath46    in the qcd contribution , we have taken @xmath47 .",
    "we notice that , with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite , our background calculation includes the z - boson spin correlation effects for the electroweak background",
    ". moreover the dominant qcd background is fully simulated .",
    "the squared matrix elements are integrated via monte carlo over phase space , and the total cross sections and distributions agree with the results of moretti@xcite .",
    "next , we interface our parton - level programs with the event generator isajet@xcite to allow for parton showers , hadronization and particle decays .",
    "we neglect initial state bremsstrahlung and beamstrahlung effects . for our analysis",
    ", these effects should mainly lead to a small rescaling of both the signal and background production cross sections .",
    "we also neglect the spin correlation of the top quark between production and decay , but expect this to be a small effect as well .    in our analysis",
    ", we use the isajet toy detector simulation program isaplt .",
    "we assume calorimetry in the range @xmath48 , with cell size @xmath49 . we take the electromagnetic energy resolution to be @xmath50 and the hadronic calorimeter resolution to be @xmath51 ( @xmath52 in gev ) .",
    "calorimeter cells are coalesced in towers of @xmath53 using the jet finding algorithm getjet .",
    "hadronic clusters with @xmath54  gev are called jets .",
    "leptons ( @xmath55 s or @xmath56 s ) with @xmath57 of 5  gev or more are considered to be isolated if the hadronic @xmath58 in a cone about the lepton of @xmath59 is less than 2  gev .",
    "jets are classified as @xmath8-jets with a tag efficiency of @xmath60 if they coincide with an original @xmath8-parton within an angle @xmath61 .",
    "to examine events in the semileptonic channel , we require :    * one and only one isolated @xmath55 or @xmath56 with @xmath62  gev , * @xmath63  gev , * exactly four tagged @xmath8-jets , * @xmath64 non-@xmath8-jets , * @xmath65(non-@xmath8-jets)@xmath66  gev ( consistent with @xmath67 ) .    the number of events expected for 1000 fb@xmath10 of integrated luminosity at @xmath25  gev is shown before and after these cuts in the first two rows of table  [ tab : eve_l_500 ] . for the time being , we take @xmath68 . already at this stage we see a huge reduction in the qcd background .",
    "the major qcd background reduction comes from the requirement of @xmath69 @xmath8-jets in the final state : for this background , the @xmath8 s from @xmath70 are usually relatively soft and not well separated in angle , so only rarely do we get four distinct @xmath8-jets from this process .",
    "the signal is already well in excess of background for @xmath71 and 110  gev , and ranges from @xmath72 events for the @xmath27 values we have chosen .",
    "an integrated luminosity of order 1000 fb@xmath10 will be essential for this measurement at @xmath25  gev .    at this stage , we can attempt to reconstruct some of the invariant masses that occur in these events . as an example , we show various mass distributions in fig .  [",
    "fig : masses ] .",
    "these distributions were generated for @xmath73  gev and @xmath11  tev ; the results for @xmath25  gev are qualitatively similar .",
    "first , in fig .  [ fig : masses]_a _ , the invariant mass of _ all _ non-@xmath8-jets in the events ( before imposing the 60 - 90  gev cut listed above ) is shown .",
    "the invariant mass rises to a peak near to , but slightly below , @xmath74 .",
    "the peak occurs below @xmath67 mainly due to jet activity leaking out of our fixed cone algorithm , so better jet reconstruction algorithms may improve upon this .",
    "we impose the @xmath65(non-@xmath8-jets)@xmath66  gev cut to insure events consistent with a hadronic @xmath7-boson decay .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : masses]_b _ , we combine the non-@xmath8-jets with the @xmath8-jet which most nearly reconstructs the top quark mass .",
    "the distribution peaks sharply just below @xmath75 , due in part to missing neutrinos from @xmath76-meson cascade decays , along with leakage from the jet cones . in fig .",
    "[ fig : masses]_c _ , we attempt to reconstruct the other @xmath77 decay .",
    "beam- and bremsstrahlung effects do not allow us to use the beam - beam center - of - mass energy to constrain the @xmath78 component of missing energy , so we work instead with transverse mass .",
    "the transverse mass distribution is shown , and peaks as expected just below @xmath79 , with considerable smearing due in part to @xmath76 and @xmath80 meson semileptonic decay contamination . finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : masses]_d _ , we reconstruct the @xmath81 cluster transverse mass .",
    "we pick one of the remaining @xmath8-jets which most nearly reconstructs to @xmath82 .",
    "the peak from the top quark decay is again visible .",
    "if our mass reconstruction algorithm has been successful , then the remaining two @xmath8-jets should reconstruct to @xmath27 for our signal events , but to other values for background events .    at this point",
    ", we note that the energy distribution of @xmath8-jets should vary considerably between signal and background .",
    "this should especially hold true for the slowest ( least energetic ) of the @xmath8-jets .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : ebsl ] the energy distribution of the slowest of @xmath8-jets , @xmath83 , at @xmath25  gev , after the above cuts . the dashed histogram for the sum of all background processes peaks at low @xmath83 , while the @xmath83 distribution for the signal becomes increasingly harder for heavier higgs boson masses . to gain some improvement in signal - to - background ratio ( s / b )",
    ", we will impose    * @xmath84    for @xmath85 and 130  gev .    after the above cuts and mass reconstructions , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : xmbbl5 ] the invariant mass of the remaining two @xmath8-jets .",
    "the signal histograms are solid , while background is dashed . for the @xmath86  gev case , the mass distribution peaks somewhat below 100  gev with a rather broad smear . in this case , the distribution in energy for @xmath8-jets from higgs decay is similar to the energy distribution of @xmath8-jets from top decay , so our reconstruction algorithm often fails to select the correct @xmath8-jets from higgs decay .",
    "in addition , neutrinos from @xmath76 and @xmath80 meson decay serve to further soften the distribution . as we increase the higgs mass in frames _ b_)_d _ ) , the signal distribution becomes harder and sharper .    for comparison ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : xmbbexl5 ] the @xmath87 distribution using generator information to select the correct @xmath8-quark jets .",
    "these distributions may be approached , for instance , by using additional information such as the previously measured higgs mass in the reconstruction algorithm . for these cases ,",
    "the higgs mass peak is more clearly defined , as is the peak in the background from the @xmath22 resonance .",
    "our results for this channel at @xmath88  gev are collected in tables  [ tab : eve_l_500 ] and [ tab : err_l_500 ] .",
    "the columns labelled with the higgs boson mass ( @xmath89 , _ etc _ ) are the signal for @xmath90 , @xmath91 followed by decays yielding four @xmath8-quark jets plus a lepton plus missing energy .",
    "the columns labelled @xmath92 and @xmath93 give the electroweak and qcd backgrounds respectively .",
    "the first row of table  [ tab : eve_l_500 ] gives the total number of @xmath31 events before the top quark decays . in the second row",
    "we report the number of events reconstructed for the specific channel . by placing cuts on the @xmath87 mass distribution ,",
    "some further improvement in s / b can be gained .",

    "even with this optimistically high luminosity , there is less than one remaining signal event for @xmath97 .    in table  [ tab : err_l_500 ] , we show the resulting statistical precision for the measurement of @xmath98 , for @xmath68 and @xmath99 .",
    "the error is calculated assuming a poisson distribution for both signal and background , and is given by = , [ poisson ] where @xmath100 and @xmath76 are respectively the number of signal and background events .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath101 will be known precisely from previous measurements at the lhc and nlc , and so the signal rate for @xmath102 depends only on @xmath1 .",
    "if high efficiency can be achieved on @xmath8-jet tagging , then already at @xmath25  gev the top quark yukawa coupling can be measured to 11% for @xmath71  gev .",
    "this decreases to 31% if only @xmath103 is achieved .",
    "the precision @xmath104 becomes rapidly worse as @xmath27 increases beyond @xmath105 . for @xmath106 and an integrated luminosity @xmath107 , we find , ~39% , m_h=120  .",
    "it appears that @xmath44 is a poor energy for the measurement of the @xmath108 yukawa coupling unless the higgs boson is @xmath109  gev . at this energy , the @xmath110 system is close to the phase space limit and the parent particles have little kinetic energy , making the kinematic cuts and event reconstruction less effective than at higher energies .",
    "in addition , the number of events is too small to obtain a statistically precise measurement for the heavier higgs boson masses .",
    "the totally hadronic channel for @xmath111 has the advantage of initially higher rates than the semileptonic channel due to the large @xmath7 boson hadronic branching fraction .",
    "however , in attempting mass reconstructions , a greater combinatoric problem is presented since there will now be typically four or more non-@xmath8-jets in each event , in addition to the four @xmath8-jets .    for the hadronic channel",

    "at @xmath11  tev , the total event rates are significantly larger than at @xmath25  gev .",
