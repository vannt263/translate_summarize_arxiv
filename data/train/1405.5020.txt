    "it has been a long history to test @xmath5 against @xmath6 for a given @xmath7 . when the dimension @xmath8 is fixed , a traditional test is the so - called hotelling @xmath0-test defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "another commonly used one is the empirical likelihood ratio test proposed by owen ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "more specifically , by defining the empirical likelihood function as @xmath11\\\\[-8pt ] & & \\hspace*{45pt}\\sum _ { i=1}^np_i=1 , \\sum _ { i=1}^np_ix_i=\\mu\\biggr\\},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] owen ( @xcite , @xcite ) showed that the wilks theorem holds under some regularity conditions , that is , @xmath12 converges in distribution to a chi - square limit with @xmath8 degrees of freedom , where @xmath7 denotes the true value of the mean of @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , based on the chi - square limit , one can construct a confidence region for @xmath3 or test @xmath14 against @xmath15 .    without assuming a family of distributions for the data , the empirical likelihood ratio statistics can be defined to share similar properties as the likelihood ratio for parametric distributions .",
    "for instance , the empirical likelihood method produces confidence regions whose shape and orientation are determined entirely by the data . in comparison with the normal approximation method and the bootstrap method for constructing confidence regions , the empirical likelihood method does not require a pivotal quantity , and it has better small sample performance ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for more details on empirical likelihood methods , we refer to @xcite and the recent review paper of @xcite .    motivated by applications in neuroimaging and bioinformatics studies , some tests for a mean vector with divergent dimension",
    "have been proposed in the literature .",
    "it is known that , as the dimension is large , the calculation of the inverse of the sample covariance matrix in hotelling @xmath0-test statistic becomes problematic and the sample covariance matrix may diverge when @xmath16 ; see @xcite . moreover , hotelling @xmath0-test is valid only when @xmath17 . in order to allow @xmath18 ,",
    "one may remove the sample matrix in hotelling s @xmath0-test statistic and avoid the singularity of the sample covariance .",
    "this is exactly what has been done in @xcite and @xcite for the two - sample test problem .",
    "the one - sample analogues of the two - sample test statistics in @xcite and @xcite lead to the following test statistics : @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively , where @xmath21 means the trace of a matrix .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath22 that is , the test in @xcite is the same as that in @xcite when the one - dimensional data is concerned . as mentioned in the end of section  3 of @xcite , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath23 depends on whether @xmath8 is fixed or goes to infinity .",
    "alternatively , @xcite and @xcite proposed to replace the covariance matrix in hotelling @xmath0-test statistic by a diagonal matrix .",
    "rates of convergence for the high - dimensional mean are studied by @xcite . for nonasymptotic studies ,",
    "we refer to arlot , blanchard and roquain ( @xcite ) .",
    "although it is known that the empirical likelihood method performs worse when the dimension @xmath8 is large and the sample size @xmath24 is not large enough , @xcite and @xcite showed that the empirical likelihood method for a fixed - dimensional mean is still valid when @xmath25 as @xmath26 .",
    "more specifically , they showed under some regularity conditions that @xmath27 converges in distribution to a standard normal if @xmath28 as @xmath26 .",
    "that is , the limiting distribution differs when the dimension of the mean vector is fixed or diverges .",
    "now , the question is whether there exists a way to test @xmath29 against @xmath6 without distinguishing the dimension of @xmath3 is finite or goes to infinity .",
    "motivated by the tests in @xcite and @xcite , we propose to apply the empirical likelihood method to the equation @xmath30 instead of @xmath31 for testing @xmath32 against @xmath15 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are independent and identically distributed random vectors with mean @xmath3 .",
    "although the equation @xmath35 is equivalent to @xmath5 , a test only based on the equation @xmath35 has a poorer power than a test based on @xmath31 .",
    "the reason is that @xmath36 instead of the standard order @xmath37 when @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a @xmath8-dimensional vector . to overcome this issue so as to improve the test power , we propose to add one more linear equation .",
    "more specifically , we propose to consider the following two equations : @xmath40 and @xmath41 it is easy to see that @xmath42 rather than @xmath43 when @xmath38 .",
    "the first equation ensures the consistency of the proposed test , and the second equation enhances the power in detecting a deviation .",
    "it turns out that the empirical likelihood method based on the above two equations works for either fixed @xmath8 or divergent @xmath8 .",
    "this differs from the results in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , the new method allows one to easily include more independent equations if such equations characterize the departure from the null hypothesis and are available .",
    "on the other hand , when the number of equations becomes large , the minimization in the empirical likelihood method turns out to be nontrivial .",
