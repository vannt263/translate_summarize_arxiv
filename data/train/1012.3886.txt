    "one of the most impressive successes of the standard model of particle physics is the determination of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron . this quantity is determined both experimentally and theoretically to such a degree of precision that the underlying physical description is vindicated .",
    "however , when it comes to the question of new physics , the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is an even more interesting quantity , see e.g. @xcite for reviews .",
    "this is due to the large mass of the muon as compared to the electron , which leads to an enhanced sensitivity to physics in and beyond the standard model .",
    "experimental efforts at brookhaven and theoretical efforts of the past ten years have pinned @xmath3 down to the @xmath4 level , leading to significant deviations between theory @xcite and experiment @xcite : @xmath5 whilst the theoretical and experimental values are determined to comparable errors , the central values give rise to a discrepancy at the @xmath6 confidence level .",
    "this difference has been present for a number of years and can be interpreted as a signal for the existence of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "however , to clearly distinguish between new physics and possible shortcomings in the sm calculations the uncertainties present in both experimental and theoretical values of @xmath3 need to be further reduced .",
    "the greatest uncertainties in the theoretical determination of @xmath3 are encountered in the hadronic contributions , i.e. those terms which involve qcd beyond perturbation theory .",
    "the most prominent of these is given by the vacuum polarisation tensor dressing of the qed vertex , see fig .",
    "[ fig : hadroniclo ] .",
    "fortunately it can be related to experimental data of @xmath7-annihilation and @xmath8-decay via dispersion relations and the optical theorem , thus resulting in a precise determination with systematically improvable errors @xcite . considered individually , its ( leading and subleading order ) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is  @xcite @xmath9\\times 10^{-11}\\;\\;.        \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although currently these uncertainties dominate the error of the theoretical result in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : amutheoretical ] ) it is foreseeable that future experiments reduce this error below that of another , more problematic source .",
    "this is the hadronic light - by - light ( lbl ) scattering diagram , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hadroniclbl ] .",
    "this contribution can not be directly related to experiment and must hence be calculated entirely through theory .",
    ".recent calculations of the hadronic light - by - light scattering contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.[tab : recent ] [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      to demonstrate parity between our approach and others in the determination of hadronic lbl , we calculate the ladder - exchange diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : photon4pt_2 ] assuming pseudoscalar pole - dominance .",
    "once more , we re - iterate that on mass - shell this is _ identical _ to the pseudoscalar exchange diagram portrayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : photon4pt ] , whereas off - shell we make the common assumption that the meson - exchange picture provides a good approximation .    in order to determine the pseudoscalar exchange contribution we must numerically determine the dressed quark propagator , the quark - photon vertex , and the homogeneous bethe - salpeter amplitude for the pseudoscalar meson . combining these together allows us to calculate from first principles the @xmath10 form - factor .",
    "we wish to emphasize again that the resulting quark - photon vertex also contains time - like poles corresponding to vector meson exchange  @xcite .",
    "thus the main ideas of vmd are naturally included here in the form - factor due to the non - perturbative approach that we employ .",
    "we have checked that the total numerical error of our calculation is of the order of one percent . in a similar fashion",
    "we also evaluate the corresponding form factors for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 mesons .",
    "we then use our results for the form factors to evaluate the pseudoscalar meson exchange contribution to lbl . for this",
    ", we use the off - shell prescription for the pseudoscalar bethe - salpeter amplitude proposed in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pionoffshell ] ) for the exchanged mesons .",
    "this prescription gives a reduction of the contribution that is similar to that found in other approaches .",
    "the systematic error of our calculation of the pseudoscalar exchange diagrams can be attributed entirely to the validity of the rainbow - ladder approximation , by the maris - tandy ( mt ) model , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : maristandy ] ) , and the off - shell prescription for the mesons , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : offshellprescriptionscalar ] ) .",
    "no other approximations have been used .",
    "while in the goldstone - boson sector the mt model works well , there is certainly a larger error in the flavour singlet sector .",
    "we therefore guesstimate a total systematic error : ten percent for the pion contribution , and twenty percent for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 contributions . with a numerical error of two percent",
    "we then obtain : @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 leading to @xmath16 for the pseudoscalar meson exchange contribution to lbl .",
    "as compared to our previous work @xcite , the values for @xmath17 and @xmath18 are slightly reduced due to a more consistent off - shell prescription in these channels .",
    "our result ( [ res : ps ] ) is compatible with previous ones @xcite , which for the pion pole contribution are displayed in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "this is not surprising , since the form - factors themselves are compatible at a qualitative level , _",
    "cf_. fig .",
    "[ fig : ff ] , and all approaches make the assumption that pseudoscalar pole - dominance is valid far from the meson mass - shell . +      having convinced ourselves that the method works we now focus on the quark loop contribution to lbl . here",
    "we follow the strategy described around eq .",
    "( [ eqn : defoffivepointfunction ] ) where the ward identity obeyed by the four - point function with respect to the external field is exploited to construct quantities that are explicitly finite . as for our numerical error we verified that we reproduce the well known perturbative result for the corresponding electron loop with an accuracy of better than one per mille . in the quark loop",
    "we use the fully dressed quark propagators for the up , down , strange and charm quarks , extracted from the dse , fig .",
    "[ fig : quarkdse ] . as already mentioned above , due to numerical complexity we are unfortunately not yet in a position where we can use the full , numerically determined quark - photon vertex used for the meson exchange contributions in the previous section .",
    "instead , we use three different approximations to the full vertex and compare the results . as explained in section [ sec : quarkphotonvertex ] due to the ward - identity we are in possession of exact expressions for the non - transversal , ball - chiu part of the vertex , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ballchiuansatz ] ) .",
    "we exploit this knowledge to compare results with ( a ) a bare vertex , ( b ) the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ballchiuansatz ] ) ( 1bc ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the quark and antiquark momenta , and ( c ) the full ball - chiu ( bc ) expression eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ballchiuansatz ] ) .",
    "a comparison between these three approximations may serve as a guide for the systematic error due to the relevance of vertex effects .",
    "we emphasize , however , that only our most elaborate approximation , ( c ) , satisfies the constraints of gauge invariance .",
    "previous approximations based on purely transverse parts of the vertex @xcite do not satisfy this constraint .",
    "we believe that the ansatz ( c ) provides an excellent basis for the calculation of the quark - loop diagram , which can and should be expanded in future work to also include transverse parts of the vertex .    as a result of our calculation",
    "we find @xmath21 for the quark loop contribution .",
    "clearly these are sizable contributions . whereas the bare vertex result roughly agrees with the number @xmath22 given in @xcite , the dressing effects of the vertex lead to a drastic increase . as compared to our result for the first part of the ball - chiu vertex @xcite we again find a drastic increase from @xmath23 to @xmath24 when the other two terms of the full ball - chiu vertex are included . in this calculation",
    "we included effects from four quark flavours in the quark - loop .",
    "their individual contributions are given by @xmath25 it is interesting to note that due to charge effects the heavy charm quark contributes more than the much lighter strange quark .    we have checked the model dependence of the above result by comparing with a similar calculation using a different model for the quark - gluon interaction @xcite .",
    "the results are similar to the one in eq .",
    "( [ res : ql ] ) within an error margin of five to ten percent .",
    "details will be given elsewhere .",
    "due to these results we estimate an additional systematic error for our bc - result of @xmath26 , which has to be added to the @xmath27 given in eq .",
    "( [ res : ql ] ) .    in general",
    ", these large dressing effects also make it very hard if not impossible to guess the effect of the total vertex dressing without an explicit calculation .",
    "certainly , however , given these findings , all previous estimates for the systematic error in the quark loop contributions seem to be an order of magnitude too small .",
    "in this paper we have presented a new approach towards the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon .",
    "we have used a combination of dyson - schwinger and bethe - salpeter equations to evaluate the pseudoscalar meson exchange contribution and the quark loop contribution to lbl .",
    "our only input is the maris - tandy model , a phenomenologically successful ansatz for the combined strength of the gluon propagator and the quark - gluon vertex .",
    "our treatment of the meson exchange contribution to lbl is different from earlier approaches in that we do not rely on an ansatz for the @xmath28 form factor , but calculate this quantity starting from the basic equations of motion of qcd .",
    "nevertheless , our result basically agrees with those from previous approaches .",
    "this result once more emphasizes that the meson exchange contributions to lbl are largely controlled by analytic constraints from qcd at large and small @xmath29 .    as for the quark - loop contribution ,",
    "analytic constraints have been used which arise from the requirement of gauge invariance : the quark - photon vertex appearing in this loop has to satisfy the vector ward - takahashy identity .",
    "in contrast to previous approaches , we have implemented this identity by using the ball - chiu ansatz for this vertex .",
    "we believe this is a systematic improvement .",
    "the consequences are drastic : we observe a dramatic increase for the quark - loop contribution to lbl .",
    "our result of @xmath30 is more than three times larger than the constituent quark result of ref .",
    "@xcite .    when combining our two results , eq .",
    "( [ res : ps ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ res : ql ] ) , we arrive at a hadronic lbl contribution of @xmath31 this value , however , does not yet account for transverse parts of the quark - photon vertex in the quark - loop contribution and for effects from the right hand diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : photon4pt ] or fig .",
    "[ fig : photon4pt_2 ] . in general , it is difficult to gauge the effects of additional transverse vertex contributions in the quark - loop diagram . in ref .",
    "@xcite part of these effects have been taken into account by using an ansatz motivated by vector - meson dominance ( vmd ) ideas .",
    "they found a reduction due to these effects of roughly @xmath32 . since we agree with ref .",
    "@xcite on the size of the pion exchange contribution , where vmd works very well , it may be justified to use their result as a rough estimate for the size and also for the potential error in these effects .",
    "we therefore add a contribution of @xmath33 to arrive at @xmath34 .",
    "the additional contributions due to the right hand diagrams of fig .  [ fig : photon4pt ] or fig .  [ fig : photon4pt_2 ] are also difficult to judge .",
    "it may help , though , to observe that these involve an additional quark - loop .",
    "typically such contributions are negative and of the order of ten to twenty percent of the leading-@xmath35 contributions @xcite .",
    "since on the other hand one also expects positive contributions of a similar size from non - pseudoscalar exchange diagrams @xcite we choose to subsume all these contributions to another @xmath36 , where the error is clearly subjective .",
    "this gives us the following total hadronic lbl contribution @xmath37 in our approach .",
    "note that the increase of the central value as compared to our previous result in ref .",
    "@xcite is due to a combination of taking the full bc - vertex instead of 1bc and in addition accounting for the transverse corrections in the quark - loop using the results of ref .",
    "taken at face value these numbers together with the other contributions quoted in @xcite clearly reduce the discrepancy between theory and experiment . combining our light - by - light scattering results with the other sm contributions",
    "gives : @xmath38 to put this result in perspective we wish to recall the caveats that to our mind are tied to it .",
    "first , there is the contribution of transverse parts of the quark - photon vertex to the quark - loop diagram .",
    "although the results of ref .  @xcite may serve as an estimate , we definitely need to explicitly calculate these contributions in our approach .",
    "second , there is the question whether the pseudoscalar meson exchange diagram provides for a good approximation of the gluon exchange contribution discussed around fig .",
    "[ fig : photon4pt_2 ] .",
    "also this assumption needs to be questioned by an explicit calculation . in this sense ,",
    "our results certainly do not provide final answers but still have to be seen as a further step towards a fundamental determination of @xmath3 .    finally , we point out that the current approach will also be checked by a calculation of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to @xmath3 . preliminary results in this direction",
