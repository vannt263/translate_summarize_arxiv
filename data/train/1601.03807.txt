    "the three most fundamental problems in the big bang theory of cosmology are the flatness problem , the horizon problem and the magnetic monopole problem . in 1980s inflation",

    "the predictions of inflation paradigm are consistent with observational facts , such as the the highly isotropic cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) , and the scale invariance of primordial density perturbations attributed to the quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field at the end of inflation  @xcite .",
    "inflation , however , is not free of problems .",
    "for instance , the initial singularity does not disappear but is delayed  @xcite .",
    "building on the success of inflation models , cosmologists have been searching for alternative scenarios that also address the problem of the cosmic singularity . in 1993 a gr - compatible solution utilizing a nonsingular bounce was proposed shortly after the first observation of current expansion  @xcite . at the same time , string theorists attempted to implement a nonsingular bounce in dilaton gravity , leading to the pre - big bang ( pbb ) scenario within string theory framework  @xcite . and many string inflation models as reviewed by linde  @xcite , and by tye  @xcite",
    ".    bounce universe has a long history , dated back to einstein , and many models  @xcite .",
    "a period of contraction is postulated to happen before the period of expansion resulting our current observable universe .",
    "for instance , a cyclic model in a conventional 4-dimensional quantum field theory generates a bounce which solved the singularity problem  @xcite .",
    "a `` matter bounce '' driven by ghost condensation was proposed to avoid ghost in the perturbation spectrum of states  @xcite ; a bounce model in n=1 super gravity was proposed to get rid of ghost excitations  @xcite and to prove that nonsingular bounces were viable in supergravity . a `` g - bounce '' model , which generates a non - singularity inflation cosmos with a galileon field  @xcite , produces a bounce in the lee - wick radiation phase with an apparent scale invariance in the perturbation spectrum  @xcite .",
    "a bounce solution was also found in the universe dominated by the quintom matter  @xcite .",
    "there is also the famous ekpyrotic universe  @xcite inspired by d - branes dynamics .",
    "bounce conditions were also found possible in f(r ) cosmology in  @xcite .",

    "the hubble parameter is nearly constant as long as the tachyon is locked at its peak by the scalar field @xmath36 .",
    "the dynamic equations of the hubble parameter , @xmath36 and @xmath14 can be simplified as follows , @xmath39 the scalar field , @xmath36 , oscillates while being redshifted @xmath40 we can calculate the number of e - folds @xmath41 in this era determined by the critical value of @xmath42 : @xmath43    ) of the tachyon - scalar field space : during the contraction period the tachyon field , @xmath14 , blue - shifts from @xmath44 to @xmath45 as the universe contracts from point @xmath28 to point @xmath29 in fig.[fig : bounce - model ] .",

    "* _ the bounce point : _ for an extended period of locked inflation at @xmath50 , the initial value @xmath51 should be larger than @xmath52 . and the locked inflation ends when @xmath53 * _ the effective mass of @xmath36 : _ the effective mass of @xmath36 is given by @xmath54 . during locked inflation , @xmath14 red - shifts and its @xmath55 @xmath56 diminishes dramatically .",
    "we assume that at the beginning of the locked inflation era @xmath47 is very large and the @xmath14 field is smaller than the bare mass of scalar field , @xmath57 at the end ; therefore @xmath58 and @xmath59 can be expressed as @xmath60 . * _ keeping @xmath36 oscillating : _ to keep @xmath36 oscillating in the locked inflation era , we demand the frequency of @xmath36 in  [ phi ] be real , which in turn implies @xmath61 . @xmath62    with these constraints we deduce the two critical relations amongst the key parameters @xmath57 , @xmath15 and @xmath63 : @xmath64 we thus see that these values cover a wide area of the parameter space , and it is easy to pick a generic set of initial conditions for a successful bounce model resulting in a realistic universe provided that @xmath65 e - foldings are generated in the locked inflation era",
    "this is to be contrasted with the fine tuning one needs for inflation models .",
    "we shall show that cstb universe is free of the horizon problem by calculating the e - foldings in the contraction phase of the cstb universe .",
    "bouncing universe models solve the horizon problem because there exists a phase of contraction  prior to the bounce  long enough to put the entire universe back into thermal contact and re - establish causality . in cstb model ,",
    "particle horizon is therefore nonzero . considering that particle horizons in expansion and contraction phases are symmetric",
    ", we only calculate the particle horizon in expansion phase .    in the era of locked inflation",
    ", the universe is vacuum energy dominated , thus the friedman equation becomes equation  [ simph ] .",
    "the universe undergoes exponential expansion as : @xmath66 the particle horizon in locked inflation is given by @xmath67    shortly after the bounce the hubble parameter changes from @xmath68 to @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , which in turn implies @xmath71 in the tachyon matter dominated era , the growth of the particle horizon is @xmath72    all in all the total particle horizon at the end of expansion would be @xmath73 therefore @xmath74 . since the maximum size of universe is larger than current size @xmath75 at the bounce point the particle horizon is much larger than the scale factor .",
    "so bouncing universe models guarantee that the particle horizon be larger than the current homogeneous regions .      in big bang cosmos",
    "the flatness problem is a cosmological fine - tuning problem .",
    "cmb data@xcite determines the current universe to be flat up to 1% percent level , @xmath76 , or @xmath77 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bounce - model ] we can read off the required e - foldings from the end of locked inflation to the present : @xmath78    after the tachyon condenses the single tachyon field rolls towards infinity with almost zero effective mass .",
    "when @xmath79 becomes large , the tachyon field can be replaced by an equivalent scalar field @xmath80 , which approaches zero when @xmath81 . with the new field",

    "@xmath85 loses its validity and one should returns to @xmath14 . at @xmath29 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bounce - model ] , the contraction phase turns into deflation .",
    "we denote this point as the ending of contraction phase with the amplitude of @xmath36 given by : @xmath93 e - foldings can be computed accordingly , @xmath94 , because @xmath95 . upon substituting the current size of universe @xmath96 into @xmath97 , we push back the current universe to the beginning of the deflation era : @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "it is convincing then to say that , with a contraction which can generate 120 e - foldings , the expansion era after the bounce can enjoy an analogous number of e - foldings@xcite .",
    "we can conclude that our bounce model solves the flatness problem by the 118 e - foldings in the contraction phase .",
    "we present a viable alternative to inflation based on string theory utilising coupled scalar and tachyon fields in the d-@xmath12-brane system  @xcite .",
    "the cstb cosmos undergoes an extended period of tachyon matter dominated contraction in which a stable and scale invariant spectrum of primordial density perturbations is produced  @xcite .",
    "the model has a signature out - of - thermal - equilibrium production of dark matter which can be tested by the future array of dark matter detections  @xcite , independently of cosmological observations .",
    "exploration on matter production and baryon asymmetry genesis is well underway  @xcite .",
    "we expect our success can inspire further studies on bounce models built from string theory or other quantum gravity theories .",
    "recently an interesting attempt is made to use ads / cft correspondence to study the evolution of matter through the bounce point  @xcite , extending the study ads singularity  @xcite to the bounce universe . together with earlier initiatives of using ads / cft to study cosmic singularities",
    "@xcite this holds great promise of a thorough study of bounce universe physics .    another interesting question to ask if the cst - bounce model can be embedded in higher dimensions , like  @xcite , and to study the stabilisation of the extra moduli in this context .",
    "further explorations shall also exploit the symmetries and dualities of the mother string theory as in  @xcite as string - cosmology models utilising t - duality hold more promise of modulus stabilisation  @xcite .",

    "<S> a bounce universe with a scale invariant as well as stable spectrum of primordial density perturbations was constructed from a string theoretical elements , using a tachyon effective potential arisen from the d - brane and anti  d - brane system . </S>",
    "<S> the tachyon is stabilized at the top of its potential via a coupling to the higgs field within . </S>",
    "<S> this is called the coupled scalar and tachyon bounce universe , or cstb cosmos for short . </S>",
    "<S> this bounce universe has been shown to be free of ghosts and does not violate the null energy condition . </S>",
    "<S> it can also solve the big bang cosmic singularity problem . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we follow up with a thorough study of the parameter space of the cstb model . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we are interested in the parameter space that can produce a single bounce to arrive at a radiation dominated universe . </S>",
    "<S> we further establish that cstb universe is a viable alternative to inflation , as it can naturally produce enough e - foldings  in the pre - bounce contractional phase as well in the post bounce expanding phase  to solve the flatness , horizon and homogeneity problems of the big bang model , leading to an observed universe of the current size .    </S>",
