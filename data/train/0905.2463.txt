    "visual localization / tracking plays a central role for many applications like intelligent video surveillance , smart transportation monitoring systems . localization and tracking algorithms aim to find the most similar region to the target in an image .",
    "recently , kernel - based tracking algorithms @xcite have attracted much attention as an alternative to particle filtering trackers @xcite .",
    "one of the most crucial difficulties in robust tracking is the construction of representation models ( likelihood models in bayesian filtering trackers ) that can accommodate illumination variations , deformable appearance changes , partial occlusions , .",
    "most current tracking algorithms use a single static template image to construct a target representation based on density models . for both kernel - based trackers and particle filtering trackers ,",
    "a popular method is to exploit color distributions in simple regions ( region - wise density models ) .",
    "generally semi - parametric kernel density estimation techniques are adopted .",
    "however , it is difficult to update this target model @xcite , and the target representation s fragility usually breaks these trackers over a long image sequence .    considerable effort has been expended to ease these difficulties .",
    "we believe that the key to finding a solution is to find the right representation . in order to accommodate appearance changes ,",
    "the representation model should be learned from as many training examples as possible .",
    "fundamentally two methods , namely on - line and off - line learning , can be used for the training procedure .",
    "on - line learning means constantly updating the representation model during the course of tracking .",
    "@xcite proposes an incremental eigenvector update strategy to adapt the target representation model .",
    "a linear probabilistic principal component analysis model is used .",
    "the main disadvantage of the eigen - model is that it is not generic and is usually only suitable for characterizing texture - rich objects . in @xcite",
    "a wavelet model is updated using the expectation maximization ( em ) algorithm .",
    "a classification function is progressively learned using adaboost for visual detection and tracking in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "@xcite adopts pixel - wise gaussian mixture models ( gmms ) to represent the target model and sequentially update them . to date , however , less work has been reported on how to elegantly update _ region - wise density _ models in tracking .",
    "in contrast , classification is a powerful bottom - up procedure : it is trained off - line and works on - line . due to the training",
    "being typically built on very large amounts of training data , its performance is fairly promising even without on - line updating of the classifier / detector .",
    "inspired by image classification tasks with color density features and real - time detection , we learn off - line a density representation model from multiple training data . by considering tracking as a binary classification problem , a discriminative classification rule is learned to distinguish between the tracked object and background patterns . in this way",
    "a robust object representation model is obtained .",
    "this proposal provides a basis for considering the design of enhanced kernel - based trackers using robust kernel object representations .",
    "a by - product of the training is the classification function , with which the tracking problem is cast into a binary classification problem .",
    "an object detector directly using the classification function is then available .",
    "combining a detector into the tracker makes the tracker more robust and provides the capabilities of automatic initialization and recovery from momentary tracking failures .    in theory ,",
    "many classifiers can be used to achieve our goal . in this paper",
    "we show that the popular kernel based non - linear support vector machine ( svm ) well fits the kernel - based tracking framework . within this framework",
    "the traditional kernel object trackers proposed in @xcite and @xcite can be expressed as special cases . because we use probabilistic density features , the learning process is closely related to probabilistic kernels based svms @xcite .",
    "it is imperative to minimize computational costs for real - time applications such as tracking .",
    "a desirable property of the proposed algorithm is that the computational complexity is independent of the number of support vectors .",
    "furthermore we empirically demonstrate that our algorithm requires fewer iterations to achieve convergence .",
    "our approach differs from @xcite although both use the svm classification score as the cost function . in @xcite",
    ", avidan builds a tracker along the line of standard optical flow tracking . only the homogeneous quadratic polynomial kernel ( or kernels with a similar quadratic structure ) can be used in order to derive a closed - form solution .",
    "this restriction prevents one using a more appropriate kernel obtained by model selection .",
    "an advantage of @xcite is that it can be used consistently with the optical flow tracking , albeit only gray pixel information can be used .",
    "moreover , the optimization procedure of our approach is inspired by the kernel - based object tracking paradigm @xcite .",
    "hence extended work such as @xcite is also applicable here , which enables us to find the global optimum .",
    "if joint spatial - feature density is used to train an svm , a fixed - point optimization method may also be derived that is similar to @xcite .",
    "the classification function of the svm trained for vehicle recognition is not smooth spatial mis - registration ( see fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "we employ a spatial kernel to smooth the cost function when computing the histogram feature . in this way ,",
    "gradient based optimization methods can be used . using statistical learning theory",
    ", we devise an object tracker that is consistent with ms tracking .",
    "the ms tracker is initially derived from kernel density estimation ( kde ) .",
    "our work sheds some light on the connection between svm and kde .",
    "another important part of our tracker is its on - line re - training in parallel with tracking .",
    "continuous updating of the representation model can capture changes of the target appearance / backgrounds .",
    "previous work such as @xcite has demonstrated the importance of this on - line update during the course of tracking .",
    "the incremental svm technique meets this end @xcite , which efficiently updates a trained svm function whenever a sample is added to or removed from the training set . for our proposed tracking framework , the target model can be learned in either batch svm training or on - line svm learning .",
    "we adopt a sophisticated on - line svm learning proposed in @xcite for its efficiency and simplicity .",
    "we address the crucial problem of adaptation , , the on - line learning of discriminant appearance model while avoiding drift .",
    "the main contributions of our work are to solve ms trackers two drawbacks : the template model can only be built from a single image ; and it is difficult to update the model . the solution is to extend the use of statistical learning algorithms for object localization and tracking .",
    "svm has been used for tracking by means of spatial perturbation of the svm @xcite .",
    "we exploit svm for tracking in a novel way ( along the line of ms tracking ) .",
    "the key ingredients of our approach are :    * probabilistic kernel based svms are trained and incorporated into the framework of ms tracking . by carefully selecting the kernel ,",
    "we show that no extra computation is required compared with the conventional single - view ms tracking . * an on - line",
    "svm can be used to adaptively update the target model .",
    "we demonstrate the benefit of on - line target model update . *",
    "we show that the annealed ms algorithm proposed in @xcite can be viewed as a special case of the continuation method under an appropriate interpretation . with the new interpretation , annealed ms",
    "can be extended to more general cases .",
    "extension and new discovers are discussed .",
    "an efficient localizer is built with global mode seeking techniques .",
    "* again , by exploiting the svm binary classifier , it is able to determine the scale of the target .",
    "an improved annealed ms - like algorithm with a cascade architecture is developed .",
    "it enables a more systematic and easier design of the annealing schedule , in contrast with _ ad hoc _ methods in previous work @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : pre ] , the general theory of ms tracking and svm is reviewed for completeness .",
    "our proposed tracker is presented in  [ sec : gkt ] .",
    "finally experimental results are reported in  [ sec : exp ] .",
    "we conclude this work in  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "for self - completeness , we review mean shift tracking , support vector machine and its on - line learning version in this section .      mean shift ( ms ) tracking was firstly presented in @xcite . in ms tracking ,",
    "the object is represented by a square region which is cropped and normalized into a unit circle . by denoting @xmath0 as the color histogram of the target model , and @xmath1 as the target candidate color histogram with the center at @xmath2 ,",
    "the similarity function between @xmath0 and @xmath3 is ( when bhattacharyya divergence @xcite is used ) , @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the dissimilarity measurement . let @xmath6 be a region s pixel positions in image @xmath7 with the center at @xmath2 . in order to make the cost function smooth ",
    "otherwise gradient based ms optimization can not be applied  a kernel with profile @xmath8 is employed to assign smaller weights to those pixels farther from the center , considering the fact that the peripheral pixels are less reliable .",
    "an @xmath9-bin color histogram is built for an image patch located at @xmath2 , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 here @xmath8 is the homogeneous spatial weighting kernel profile and @xmath12 is its bandwidth .",

    "the representation of candidate @xmath19 takes the same form .",
    "given an initial position @xmath20 , the problem of localization / tracking is to estimate a best displacement @xmath21 such that the measurement @xmath22 at the new location best matches the target @xmath0 , , @xmath23    by taylor expanding @xmath24 at the start position @xmath20 and keeping only the linear item ( first - order taylor approximation ) , the above optimization problem can be resolved by an iterative procedure :    @xmath25 }           =          \\frac {   \\sum_{\\ell=1}^n {   \\bi_\\ell { \\widetilde w}_\\ell   g          (          \\vert   \\frac{\\bc ^ { [ \\tau ] }                - \\bi_\\ell}{h }          \\vert^2                    )          }             }             {           \\sum_{\\ell=1}^n {            { \\widetilde w}_\\ell   g            (          \\vert   \\frac{\\bc ^ { [ \\tau ] }                     - \\bi_\\ell}{h }          \\vert^2           )             }             } , \\ ] ]    where @xmath26 and the superscript @xmath27 , indexes the iteration step .",

    "we limit our explanation of the support vector machine classifiers algorithm to an overview .",
    "large margin classifiers have demonstrated their advantages in many vision tasks .",
    "svm is one of the popular large margin classifiers @xcite which has a very promising generalization capacity .",
    "the linear svm is the best understood and simplest to apply .",
    "however , linear separability is a rather strict condition .",
    "kernels are combined into margins for relaxing this restriction .",
    "svm is extended to deal with linearly non - separable problems by mapping the training data from the input space into a high - dimensional , possibly infinite - dimensional , feature space , , @xmath30 . using the kernel trick ,",
    "the map @xmath31 is not necessarily known explicitly . like other kernel methods",
    ", svm constructs a symmetric and positive definite kernel matrix ( gram matrix ) which represents the similarities between all training datum points .",

    "the training process of svm then determines the parameters @xmath49 by solving the optimization problem @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the slack variable set and the regularization parameter @xmath52 determines the trade - off between svm s generalization capability and training error .",

    "@xmath59 in @xcite for the backbone of the algorithm .",
    "we omit the details due to space constraint .",
    "as mentioned , visual tracking is naturally a time - varying problem .",
    "an on - line learning method allows updating the model during the course of tracking .",
    "the standard kernel - based ms tracker is generalized by maximizing a sophisticated cost function defined by svm .      measuring",
    "the similarity between images and image patches is of central importance in computer vision . in svms",
    ", the kernel @xmath60 plays this role .",
    "most commonly used kernels such as gaussian and polynomial kernels are not defined on the space of probability distributions . recently various probabilistic kernels have been introduced , including the fisher kernel @xcite , top @xcite , kullback - leibler kernel @xcite and probability product kernels ( ppk ) @xcite , to combine generative models into discriminative classifiers .",
    "a probabilistic kernel is defined by first fitting a probabilistic model @xmath61 to each training vector @xmath36 .",
    "the kernel is then a measure of similarity between probability distributions .",
    "ppk is an example @xcite , with kernel given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a constant .",
    "when @xmath64 , ppk reduces to a special case , termed the bhattacharyya kernel : @xmath65 in the case of discrete histograms , , @xmath66^\\t $ ] and @xmath67^\\t $ ] , becomes @xmath68 when @xmath69 , @xmath70 computes the expectation of one distribution over the other , and hence is termed the expected likelihood kernel @xcite . in @xcite",
    "its corresponding statistical affinity is used as similarity measurement for tracking .",
    "the bhattacharyya kernel is adopted in this work due to :    * the standard ms tracker @xcite uses the bhattacharyya distance .",
    "it is clearer to show the connection between the proposed tracker and the standard ms tracker by using bhattacharyya kernel . *",
    "it has been empirically shown , at least for image classification , that the generalization capability of expected likelihood kernel @xmath71 is weaker than the bhattacharyya kernel . meanwhile , non - linear probabilistic kernels including bhattacharyya kernel , kullback - leibler kernel , rnyi kernel perform similarly @xcite .",
    "moreover , bhattacharyya kernel is simple and has no kernel parameter to tune .",
    "the ppk has an interesting characteristic that the mapping function @xmath72 is explicitly known : @xmath73 .",
    "this is equivalent to directly setting @xmath74 and the kernel @xmath75 .",
    "consequently for discrete ppk based svms , in the test phase the computational complexity is independent of the number of support vectors .",
    "this is easily verified .",
    "the decision function is @xmath76^\\t               \\bp ( \\bx ) ^\\rho + b         }   \\\\           & =           \\left [   \\sum_{i=1}^{n_s } {           \\hbeta_i    \\bq ( \\bx_i ) ^\\rho }           \\right]^\\t           \\bp ( \\bx ) ^\\rho + b.        \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term in the bracket can be calculated beforehand .",
    "for example , for histogram based image classification like @xcite , given a test image @xmath77 , the histogram vector @xmath78 is immediately available .",
    "in fact we can interpret discrete ppk based svms as _ linear _ svms in which the input vectors are @xmath79the features _ non - linearly _ , it is linear .",
    "the non - linear probabilistic kernels induce a transformed feature space ( as the bhattacharyya kernel does ) to smooth density such that they significantly improve classification over the linear kernel @xcite . ]",
    "extracted from image densities .",
    "again , one might argue that , since the bhattacharyya kernel is very similar to the linear svm , it might not have the same power in modelling complex classification boundaries as the traditional non - linear kernels like the gaussian or polynomial kernel .",
    "the experiments in @xcite indicate that the classification performance of a probabilistic kernel which consists an exponential calculation is not clearly better : exponential kernels like the kullback - leibler kernel and rnyi kernel performs similarly as bhattacharyya kernel on various datasets for image classification .",
    "moreover our main purpose is to learn a representation model for visual tracking .",
    "unlike other image classification tasks  in which high generalization accuracy is demanded  for visual tracking achieving very high accuracy might not be necessary and may not translate to a significant increase in tracking performance .",
    "note that ppks are less compelling when the input data are vectors with no further structure .",
    "however , even the gaussian kernel is a special case of ppk ( @xmath80 in equation   and @xmath81 is a single gaussian fit to @xmath82 by maximum likelihood ) @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the reduced set method is applied in @xcite to reduce the number of support vectors for speeding up the classification phase .",
    "applications which favour fast computation in the testing phase , such as large scale image retrieval , might also benefit from this discrete ppk s property .",
    "it is well known that the magnitude of the svm score @xmath83 measures the _ confidence _ in the prediction .",
    "the proposed tracking is based on the assumption that the local maximum of the svm score corresponds to the target location we seek , starting from an initial guess close to the target .    if the local maximum is positive , the tracker accepts the candidate .",
    "otherwise an exhaustive search or localization process will start . the tracked position at time @xmath84 is the initial guess of the next frame @xmath85 and so forth .",
    "we now show how the local maximum of the decision score is determined .    as in @xcite ,",
    "a histogram representation of the image region can be computed as equation  .    with equations  , and , we have to represent the image region .",
    "we also use the image center @xmath2 to represent the image region @xmath86 . for clarity",
    "we define notation @xmath87 . ]",
    "@xmath88 we assume the search for the new target location starts from a near position @xmath89 , then a taylor expansion of the kernel around @xmath90 is applied , similar to @xcite . after some manipulations and putting those terms independent of @xmath2 together , denoted by @xmath91 , becomes @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 }          { \\sqrt{p_u ( \\bc_0 ) }   } \\delta           ( { \\vartheta (          \\bi_\\ell -u ) }    ) } .",

    "the first term of @xmath95 is the weighted kernel density estimate with kernel profile @xmath8 at @xmath2 .",
    "it is clear now that our cost function @xmath96 has an identical format as the standard ms tracker .",
    "can we simply set @xmath97 which leads to a fixed - point iteration procedure to _ maximize _ @xmath95 as the standard ms does ?",
    "if it works , the optimization would be similar to .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath97 can not guarantee a local maximum convergence .",

    "note that no theoretical analysis is given in @xcite .",
    "we show that the methods in @xcite can not guarantee converging to a local maximum mode .",
    "see appendix for details .",
    "the above problem may be avoided by using @xmath59-class svms @xcite in which @xmath98 is strictly positive .",
    "however the discriminative power of svm is also eliminated due to its unsupervised nature .    in this work , we use a quasi - newton gradient descent algorithm for maximizing @xmath101 in .",
    "in particular , the l - bfgs algorithm @xcite is adopted for implementing the quasi - newton algorithm .",
    "we provide callbacks for calculating the value of the svm classification function @xmath101 and its gradient .",
    "typically , only few iterations of the optimization procedure are performed at each frame .",
    "it has been shown that quasi - newton can be a better alternative to ms optimization for visual tracking @xcite in terms of accuracy .",
    "quasi - newton was also used in @xcite for kernel - based template alignment . besides",
    ", in @xcite the authors have shown that quasi - newton converges around twice faster than the standard ms does for data clustering .",
    "the essence behind the proposed svm score maximization strategy is intuitive .",
    "the cost function favors both the dissimilarity to negative training data ( , background ) and the similarity to positive training data . compared to the standard ms tracking",
    ", our strategy provides the capability to utilize a large amount of training data .",
    "the terms with positive @xmath102 in the cost function play the role to attract the target candidate while the negative terms repel the candidate . in @xcite zhao",
    "have extended ms tracking by introducing a background term to the cost function , , @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath104 is the background color histogram in the corresponding region .",
    "it also linearly combines both positive and negative terms into tracking and better performance has been observed .",
    "it is simple and no training procedure is needed .",
    "nevertheless it lacks an elegant means to exploit available training data and the weighting parameters @xmath105 and @xmath106 need to be tuned manually .",
    "the original ms tracker s analysis relies on kernel properties @xcite .",
    "we argue that the main purpose of the kernel weighting scheme is to smooth the cost function such that iterative methods are applicable .",
    "kernel properties then derive an efficient ms optimization .",
    "as observed by many other authors @xcite , the kernels used as weighting kernel density estimation @xcite .",
    "we can simply treat the feature distribution as a weighted histogram to smooth the cost function and , at the same time , to account for the non - rigidity of tracked targets .",
    "note that ( 1 ) the optimization reduces to the standard ms tracking if @xmath107 ; ( 2 ) other probability kernels like @xmath108 are also applicable here .",
    "the only difference is that @xmath109 in will be in other forms .    in previous contents",
    "we have shown that in the testing phase discrete ppk s support vectors do not introduce extra computation .",
    "again , for our tracking strategy , no computation overhead is introduced compared with the traditional ms tracking in @xcite .",
    "this can be seen from equation .",
    "the summation in ( the bracketed term ) can be computed off - line .",
    "the only extra computation resides in the training phase : the proposed tracking algorithm has the _ same _ computation complexity as the standard ms tracker .",
    "it is also straightforward to extend this tracking framework to spatial - feature space @xcite which has proved more robust .",
    "+        a technique is proposed in @xcite , dubbed annealed mean shift ( ) , to reliably find the global _ density _ mode .",
    "is motivated by the observation that the number of modes of a kernel density estimator with a gaussian kernel is monotonically non - increasing the bandwidth of the kernel .",
    "here we re - interpret this global optimization and show that it is essentially a special case of the _ continuation _ approach @xcite . with the new interpretation ,",
    "it is clear now that this technique is applicable to a broader types of cost functions , not necessary to a density function .",
    "the continuation method is one of the unconstrained global optimization techniques which shares similarities with deterministic annealing . a series of gradually deformed but smoothed cost functions are successively optimized , where the solution obtained in the previous step serves as an initial point in the current step .",
    "this way the convergence information is conveyed . with sufficient smoothing , the first cost function will be concave / convex such that the global optimum can be found .",
    "the algorithm iterates until it traces the solution back to the original cost function .",
    "we now recall some basic concepts of the continuation method .    given a non - linear function @xmath110 , the transformation @xmath111 for @xmath110 is defined such that @xmath112 , @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a smoothing function ; usually the gaussian is used .",
    "@xmath12 is a positive scalar which controls the degree of smoothing .",
    "@xmath115 is a normalization constant such that @xmath116    note the similarity between the smoothing function @xmath114 and the definition of the kernel in kde . from",
    ", the defined transformation is actually the convolution of the cost function with @xmath117 . in the frequency domain ,",
    "the frequency response of @xmath118 equals the product of the frequency responses of @xmath119 and @xmath120 . being a smoothing filter ,",
    "the effect of @xmath117 is to remove high frequency components of the original function .",
    "therefore one of the requirements for @xmath114 is its frequency response must be a low - pass frequency filter .",
    "we know that popular kernels like gaussian or epanechnikov kernel are low - pass frequency filters .",
    "this is one of the principle justifications for using gaussian or epanechnikov to smooth a function .",
    "when @xmath12 is increased , @xmath111 becomes smoother and for @xmath121 , the function is the original function .",
    "the annealed version of mean shift introduced in @xcite for global mode seeking is a special case of the general continuation method defined in equation .",
    "let the original function @xmath122 take the form of a dirac delta comb ( impulse train in signal processing ) , , @xmath123 , where @xmath47 is known . with the fundamental property that @xmath124 for any function @xmath125 , we have @xmath126 this is exactly same as a kde .",
    "this discovers that is a special case of the continuation method .",

    "estimates are expected . as we will see in the experiments ,",
    "reasonable results can be obtained with only color .",
    "it is natural to combine into a cascade structure , like the cascade detector of @xcite .",
    "we start ms search from a large bandwidth @xmath130 .",
    "after convergence , an extra verification is applied to decide whether to terminate the search .",
    "if @xmath131 , it means @xmath130 is too large . then we need to reduce the bandwidth to @xmath132 and start ms with the initial location @xmath133 .",
    "this procedure is repeated until @xmath134 , @xmath135 .",
    "@xmath136 and @xmath137 are the final scale and position .",
    "little extra computation is needed because only a decision verification is introduced at each stage .",
    "in this section we implement a localizer and tracker and discuss related issues .",
    "experimental results on various data sets are shown .",
    "for the first experiment , we have trained a face representation model .",
    "@xmath138 faces cropped from caltech-@xmath139 are used as positive raw images , and @xmath140 negative images are randomly cropped from images which do not contain faces .",
    "the image size is reduced to @xmath141 pixels .",
    "kernel - weighted rgb colour histograms , consisting of @xmath142 bins , are extracted for classification . by default",
    "we use a soft svm trained with libsvm ( slightly modified to use customized kernels ) .",
    "test accuracy on the training data is @xmath143 ; and @xmath144 on a test data set which contains totally @xmath145 negative data .",
    "note that our main purpose is not to train a powerful face detector ; rather , we want to obtain an appearance model that is more robust than the single - view appearance model .",
    "we now test how well the algorithm maximizes the svm score .",
    "first , we feed the algorithm a rough initial guess and run ms .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : trackingexp1 ] for details .",
    "the first example in fig .",
    "[ fig : trackingexp1 ] comes from the training data set .",
    "the initial svm score is negative . in this case",
    ", a single step is required to switch to a positive score  it moves closely to the target after one iteration .",
    "we plot the corresponding cost function in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . by comparison ,",
    "the cost function of the standard ms is also plotted ( the target template is cropped from the same image ) .",
    "we can clearly see the difference .",
    "the other two test images are from outside of the training data set . despite the significant face color difference and variation in illumination ,",
    "our svm localizer works well in both tests . to compare the robustness",
    ", we use the first face as a template to track the second face in fig .",
    "[ fig : trackingexp1 ] , the standard ms tracker fails to converge to the true position .",
    "we now apply the global maximum seeking algorithm to object localization . in @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that it is possible to locate a target no matter from which initial position the ms tracker starts . here",
    "we use the learned classification rule to determine when to stop searching .",
    "we start the annealed continuation procedure with the initial bandwidth @xmath146",
    ". then the bandwidth pyramid works with the rule @xmath147 , @xmath148 .",
    "@xmath149 is the maximum number of iterations .",
    "we stop the search when for some @xmath9 the svm score is positive upon convergence .",
    "the image center is set to be the initial position of the search for these @xmath150 tests .",
    "we present the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : localisationexp1 ] .    in the first test ,",
    "our proposed algorithm works well : it successfully finds the face location , and also the final bandwidth well fits the target .",
    "[ fig : localisationexp1 ] ( right ) shows how the svm score evolves .",
    "it can be seen that every bandwidth change significantly increases the score .",
    "if the target size is large and there is a significant overlap between the target and a search region at a coarse bandwidth , @xmath136 , the overlap can make the cascade search stop _ prematurely _ ( see the second test in fig .",
    "[ fig : localisationexp1 ] ) .",
    "again this problem is mainly caused by the color feature s weak discriminative power .",
    "a remedy is to include more features .",
    "however , for certain applications where the scale - size is not critically important , our localization results have been usable .",
    "furthermore , better results could be achieved when we train a model for a specific object ( , train an appearance model for a specific person ) with a single color feature .",
    "effectiveness of the proposed generalized kernel - based tracker is tested on a number of video sequences .",
    "we have compared with two popular color histogram based methods : the standard ms tracker @xcite and particle filters @xcite .",
    "unlike the first experiment , we do not train an _ off - line _ svm model for tracking .",
    "it is not easy to have a large amount of training data for a general object , therefore in the tracking experiment , an on - line svm described in  [ sec : onlinesvm ] is used for training .",
    "the user crops several negative data and positive data for initial training . during the course of tracking the on - line svm updates its model by regarding the tracked region as a positive example and randomly selecting a few sub - regions ( background area ) around the target as negative examples .",

    "hence the displacement between neighboring frames is large .",
    "the illumination also changes .",
    "the background scene is cluttered and contains materials with similar color as the target .",
    "the proposed algorithm tracks the whole sequence successfully .",
    "[ fig : tracking1 ] summarizes the tracking results .",
    "the standard ms tracker fails at frame # 57 ; recovers at frame # 74 and then fails again .",

    "again we can see the proposed tracker performs best due to its learned template model and on - line adaptivity .",

    "we have shown promising tracking results of the proposed tracker on several video clips .",
    "we now present some quantitative comparisons of our algorithm with other trackers .",
    "first , we run the proposed tracker , ms , and particle filter trackers on the cubicle sequence 1 . in fig .",

    "but visually there is no significant difference , so we have not included ms results in fig .",
    "[ fig : cubicle1 ] .",
    "again , the particle filter tracker uses @xmath153 particles .",
    "we have run the particle filter @xmath155 times and the best result is reported .",
    "[ fig : qant1 ] shows the absolute deviation of the tracked object s center at each frame .",
    "clearly the generalized kernel tracker demonstrates the best result .",
    "we have reported the average tracking error ( the euclidean distance of the object s center against the ground truth ) in table  [ tab : quat1 ] , which shows the proposed tracker outperforms ms and particle filter . in table",
    "[ tab : quat1 ] , the error variance estimates are calculated from the tracking results of all frames regardless the target is lost or not .",
    "we have also proved the importance of on - line svm update .",
    "as mentioned , when we switch off the on - line update , our proposed tracker would behave similarly to the standard ms tracker .",
    "we see from table  [ tab : quat1 ] that even without updating , the generalized kernel tracker is slightly better than the standard ms tracker .",
    "this might be because the initialization schemes are different : the generalized kernel tracker can take multiple positive as well as negative training examples to _ learn _ an appearance model , while ms can only take a single image for initialization .",
    "although we only use very few training examples ( less than @xmath156 ) , it is already better than the standard ms tracker . in this sequence ,",
    "when the target object is occluded , the particle filter tracker only tracks the visible region such that the deviation becomes large .",
    "our approach updates the learned appearance model using on - line svm .",
    "the region that partially contains the occlusion is added to the object class database gradually based on the on - line update procedure .",
    "this way our tracker tracks the object position close to the ground truth .",

    "the generalized kernel tracker ( around @xmath161 fps ) is comparable to the standard ms tracker , and much faster than the particle filter .",
    "this coincides with the theoretical analysis : our generalized kernel tracker s computational complexity is independent of the number of support vectors , so in the test phrase , the complexity is almost same as the standard ms .",
