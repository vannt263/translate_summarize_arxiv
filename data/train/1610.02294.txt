    "short and ultrashort laser pulses are known to generate lipss ( laser induced periodic surface structures ) or ripples on the surfaces of metals , dielectrics and semiconductors .",
    "the pattern appears if the surface is exposed to multiple @xcite or even single @xcite laser shots .",
    "although the lipss have been observed from 1960s on laser - irradiated surfaces of materials of different kind , mechanisms of their formation are still controversially discussed in the literature .",
    "the first observation and explanation of the periodic pattern induced by ruby laser ablation of semiconductors was reported by birnbaum @xcite ; he explained the pattern by the diffraction of the laser beam on optical elements of the set up .",
    "nowadays the most common approach to the explanation of the patterns is based on interference of the incident laser beam with the surface - scattered wave @xcite .",
    "the resulting periodic pattern of the energy deposited at the target surface manifests itself in the periodically - patterned material ablation . in the frames of the plasmonic model ,",
    "the excited surface wave is a surface plasmon polariton ( spp ) , and the standing wave is formed by the interference of the plasmonic and laser fields , which results in a spatially modulated electron heating along the surface .",
    "the surface scattered wave and plasmonic models can explain the period and the orientation of the patterns under certain irradiation conditions , accounting for ablation from the peaks of the periodic absorption pattern .",
    "however , many contradictions between these models and experimental observations also exist in the literature @xcite .",
    "these contradictions raise the question on whether other mechanisms / processes can contribute to the formation of the diversity of the observed periodic surface structures , especially during post - irradiation evolution of laser - disturbed surfaces .",
    "one of the most obvious candidates for the alternative mechanism of the lipss formation would be a hydrodynamic instability of the liquid melt on the surface . indeed , there are many processes , which can cause periodic pattern formation @xcite in thin liquid layers . in @xcite , a phenomenological approach based on the kuramoto - sivashinsky model",

    "the model describes the morphology of the structures for multiple pulse ablation but can not give an explanation for single - pulse pattern formation .",

    "however , the most of the physical processes upon femtosecond laser ablation of metals are well - understood and some of them can be described analytically , suggesting the possibility of developing a realistic physical model of the lipss formation .    the physical processes triggered on the surface of metals by ultrashort laser pulses can be treated in frames of the two - temperature model ( ttm ) , whose details are described in many publications , see e.g  @xcite . in this work",

    "the slight discrepancy in the dispersion relation cut - off between the analytical forecast ( see fig .  [ figew ] and eq.([eq_unstableanalyticalcond ] ) ) and the current simulations ( see fig .",

    "such behavior should manifest itself upon laser irradiation of metals when pulse duration is small enough to enable non - equilibrium between the lattice and electron temperatures on the time scale succeeding to the laser pulse .",
    "for some materials with efficient electron - lattice coupling , fast electron - lattice thermalization can significantly shorten the growth phase of the modulation amplitude of the lattice temperature .",

    "however , due to strong non - equilibrium excitation of the electron subsystem at ultrashort laser pulses , the reflectivity of metals can considerably be changing during irradiation . when the electron temperature increases but still remains under the fermi temperature ( about 5.5  ev for gold  @xcite ) , the characteristic collision frequency of electrons is also increasing that is associated with an enhanced light absorption .",

    "<S> in this paper we investigate whether the periodic structures on metal surfaces exposed to single ultrashort laser pulses can appear due to an instability induced by two - temperature heating dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the results of two - temperature model ( ttm ) 2d simulations are presented on the irradiation of gold by a single 800  nm femtosecond laser pulse whose intensity is modulated in order to reproduce a small initial temperature perturbation , which can arise from incoming and scattered surface wave interference . </S>",
    "<S> the growing ( unstable ) modes of the temperature distribution along the surface may be responsible for the lipss ( laser induced periodic surface structures ) formation . after the end of the laser pulse and before the complete coupling between lattice and electrons occurs , the evolution of the amplitude of the subsequent modulation in the lattice temperature reveals different tendencies depending on the spatial period of the initial modulation . </S>",
    "<S> this instability - like behaviour is shown to arise due to the perturbation of the electronic temperature which relaxes slower for bigger spatial periods and thus imparts more significant modulations to the lattice temperature . </S>",
    "<S> small spatial periods of the order of 100 nm and smaller experience stabilization and fast decay from the more efficient lateral heat diffusion which facilitates the relaxation of the electronic temperature amplitude due to in - depth diffusion </S>",
    "<S> . an analytical instability analysis of a simplified version of the ttm set of equations supports the lattice temperature modulation behaviour obtained in the simulations and reveals that in - depth diffusion length is a determining parameter in the dispersion relation of unstable modes . </S>",
    "<S> finally it is discussed how the change in optical properties can intensify the modulation - related effects .    </S>",
