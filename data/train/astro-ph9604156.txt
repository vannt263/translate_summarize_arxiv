    "kelvin - helmholtz instability due to shearing induced by large velocity gradients is well known to develop in extragalactic jets .",
    "this has been shown by several analytical and numerical works such as the ones reviewed for instance by birkinshaw , 1991 .",
    "these studies often consider the jet as a single fluid with one bulk velocity and a single interface made by a sheared layer with the external medium .",
    "however there exist both observational and theoretical pieces of evidence supporting the fact that components with different bulk velocities are present inside jets themselves . among the observational data showing the presence of different velocities inside jets we can mention ( i ) the detection in some compact sources of vlbi components with different apparent speed , ( ii ) the superluminal effect which proves that some jets are highly relativistic at vlbi scale while properties of the extended component rather suggest classical or mildly relativistic large scale jets , ( iii ) the presence in some sources of entrained gas which emits optical lines from which one can infer velocities likely smaller than the main bulk velocity of the jet . the peculiar morphology of the wide angle tail radio sources ( wats ) appears also very difficult to explain ( eilek et al , 1984 ; odonoghue et al , 1990 and 1993 ) except if one assumes that matter with two different speeds is present in the jet , namely one relativistic component radiating before the inner hot spot and one component with slow speed radiating after the inner hot spot ( leahy , 1984 ) .",
    "recent data on m87 provide the first direct measurement of apparent bulk velocity at the kiloparsec scale and show a complex velocity pattern with the presence of quite different bulk flow velocities along the jet ( biretta et al , 1995 ) . in 3c273 , the radio emitting jet appears longer and wider than the optical one .",
    "bahcall et al ( 1995 ) suggest that there are actually two superposed components , a fast - moving inner jet surrounded by a slow - moving `` cocoon '' . besides that",
    ", a fanaroff - riley type ii radio source can also be considered as a stratified jet with two different layers corresponding to the inner real jet and to the backflow forming the surrounding cocoon .",
    "a quite new way of looking at the radio data appears as well in favour of the existence of several components in radio sources .",
    "starting with the use of color - color diagrams ( katz - stone et al , 1993 ) , rudnick et al , 1994 and katz - stone and rudnick ( 1994 ) show that it is reasonable to assume a distribution of radiating particles which is not a power - law throughout the sources and can then partially isolate the different parameters which contribute to the synchrotron brightness , namely the magnetic field b , the number of radiating particles @xmath0 and some fiducial lorentz factor @xmath1 that characterizes their energy distribution . adding some knowledge concerning the shape of the radiating particle distribution , they can produce frequency - independent maps , proportional to @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this powerful method provides a completely changed view of the sources in which new features are discovered .",
    "for instance , in the eastern lobe of cygnus a , they detect an edge - brightened channel girdled by rings , which corresponds to a real enhancement of the radiating particle density , likely located around the counterjet ( katz - stone , rudnick , 1994 ) .",
    "recent developments of their technics lead them to suggest that jets in both fri and frii sources may have coaxial sheaths a few times wider than the jets themselves . from their `` tomography '' analysis of radio data which combine maps at different frequencies , they detect two - component structures in 3c449 and 1231 + 674 , with flat spectrum jets surrounded by sheaths of steep spectrum emission with different polarization properties ( rudnick , 1995 ) . it is not yet known whether such sheaths emanate from the inner jets or have been directly ejected from the central engines .",
    "however their presence deeply emphasizes the likelihood of multi - component jet models .",
    "indeed several models of jet formation and propagation reach the concept of stratified jets .",
    "first chan and henriksen , 1980 , mentioned the `` multilevel '' structure as a basic modification to add to their self - similar jet model in order to explain why jets appear to have nozzles on very different scales .",
    "smith and raine , 1985 , investigate a two - level configuration and explore the possibility to produce collimated outflows by the interaction of a nuclear wind from the very inner region of an active galactic nucleus with a compton - heating - induced wind from an accretion disc .",
    "baker et al , 1988 , deal with another kind of two - component model while studying the radiative properties of a relativistic particle beam injected into an extragalactic jet and the possibility of collective emission of radio waves .",
    "a completely different approach by melia and knigl , 1989 , studies the compton - drag deceleration of ultrarelativistic nuclear jets .",
    "it predicts the existence of a transverse gradient in the asymptotic bulk lorentz factor distribution of the particles in the radio jets .",
    "knigl and kartje ( 1994 ) also consider highly stratified winds from accretion discs , with inner ionized gas and outer dusty neutral outflow .",
    "sol , pelletier , asso , 1989 , propose a two - component model taking into account a relativistic electron - positron beam extracted from the funnel of an accretion disc and streaming through a classical electron - proton collimated wind coming out from all parts of the disc .",
    "this model provides a simple explanation to the velocity dilemma if vlbi jets and superluminal motion are related to the relativistic beam while kiloparsec scale radio features are associated to the slower collimated wind .",
    "stability of such a configuration relatively to the excitation of langmuir , alfven and whistler waves has been found for electron - positron beams propagating along strong enough magnetic field with small enough lorentz factor ( sol et al , 1989 ; achatz et al , 1990 ; pelletier and sol , 1992 ; achatz and schlickeiser , 1992 ) .",
    "the condition for stability against excitation of langmuir waves requires a strong longitudinal magnetic field @xmath5 such that the electron gyrofrequency is larger than the plasma frequency in the wind , namely @xmath6 in cgs units where @xmath7 is the wind density .",
    "the constraint on the lorentz factor @xmath8 comes from the necessity to avoid excitation of alfven waves which imposes @xmath9 .",
    "therefore it appears possible to quench the beam - plasma instability and to ensure a two - component configuration stable from the point of view of microphysics .",
    "however , the question of large scale fluid instability of such two - component jet is still open .",
    "it is investigated in the present work . as a first approach to the study of the kelvin - helmholtz stability of stratified jets ,",
    "we consider here a core - sheet structure .",
    "it is the simplest `` multilevel '' configuration which appears in some jet models ( smith and raine , 1985 ; baker et al , 1988 ; sol et al , 1989 ) and provides an approximation to the general case of jets surrounded by cocoons or sheaths .    =",
    "we describe the jet with the 2-dimensional slab geometry , which provides an adequate description of the more realistic cylindrical case with respect to the kelvin - helmholtz instability ( ferrari et al . 1982 ) . for a large range of physical parameters , the solutions for both the slab and cylindrical cases have similar behaviour , apart from slight numerical differences .",
    "this similarity associates the symmetrical and antisymmetrical perturbations of the slab jet with the pinching and helical perturbations of the cylindrical jet respectively .",
    "only high order fluting modes do not have counterparts in slab jets ( ferrari et al , 1982 ; hardee , norman , 1988 )",
    ".    both spatial and temporal stability analysis of kelvin - helmholtz instability have been carried out in the literature .",
    "spatial and convected temporal growth rates have been shown to be not equal but still similar in the two approaches ( hardee , 1986 ; norman , hardee , 1988 ) .",
    "this paper investigates the temporal behavior of the instability .",
    "we consider a core - sheet jet made of three layers as shown in fig .  1 and describe the transition layers at all interfaces in the vortex - sheet approximation .",
    "the 2-dimensional core - sheet jet initially flows along the @xmath10-axis on the @xmath11 plane .",
    "the unperturbed equilibrium state is defined as follows .",
    "@xmath12 corresponds to the radius of the inner core , @xmath13 to the radius of the surrounding sheet .",

    "another way to cancel the effect of external gas is to assume a very large sheet since the factor of @xmath108 in ( [ eq:33 ] ) vanishes as @xmath109 $ ] for @xmath110 .",
    "a stratified jet with infinite sheet therefore corresponds to a single jet with only core and sheet components .",
    "conversely , for @xmath111 , internal and external interfaces coincide and equations ( [ eq:33 ] ) reduce again to the case of a single jet , but then with only core component and external gas .",
    "the method used to solve the dispersion relation ( [ eq:33 ] ) is based on the newton - raphson method ( press et al , 1992 ) .",
    "different sets of parameters have been investigated .",
    "they all lead to the same qualitative results .    1 .",
    "the presence of the sheet induces an oscillating pattern on the growth rate diagram 2 .",
    "the stability properties are dominated by the sheet even if its thickness is comparable with the core radius .",
    "the amplitude of oscillations of growth rate diminish with increasing sheet thickness .",
    "this is well illustrated in figs .",
    "2 to 4 which show the temporal growth rate of the antisymmetric fundamental , first and second reflection modes of core and sheet jets .",
    "the apparent oscillating pattern is a new feature caused by the reflections of acoustic waves at the interface between sheet and external gas .",
    "these reflections are represented by the reflection coefficient @xmath108 in dispersion relation ( [ eq:33 ] ) .",
    "the wave radiated at the core - sheet ( @xmath112 ) interface toward the sheet layer is reflected from the sheet - external ( @xmath113 ) interface and next returns to the ( @xmath112 ) interface as shown in fig .",
    "thus , one can expect resonances due to the presence of the sheet component if @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the change of phase of sound wave in sheet on the path between @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath112 interfaces and @xmath116 is an integer number . introducing the length of path of the wave between @xmath112 and @xmath113 interfaces",
    "( see fig .",
    "5 ) @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the wave propagation angle defined by @xmath119 , and the wavelength @xmath120 we can write the resonant condition ( [ rescond0 ] ) in explicit form @xmath121 the above interpretation of the oscillating pattern is demonstrated in fig .",
    "6 . , where we presented again the solution of fig .  4 in the linear scale",
    "the superimposed high bars represent these values of @xmath72 ( one should remember that @xmath74 is a function of @xmath72 ) for which the condition ( [ rescond1 ] ) is fulfilled . for comparison ,",
    "the small bars represent these @xmath72 for which we have an antiresonance @xmath122 we can easily notice a coincidence of the maxima of growth rate with high bars and minima with small bars , what proves the validity of our physical interpretation . in a case of external gas which is significantly lighter then the sheet gas we notice @xmath123 ( the change of phase by @xmath124 ) resulting in a reversed relation between bars and the maxima of growth rate .",
    "this effect is remarkable comparing figs .  2 and 3 , where maxima and minima in both the figures are inverted .",
    "figure  5 shows a clear coincidence of maxima , minima and bars described above .",
    "varying the parameters of the core sheet configuration we observe however that the bars can be shifted uniformly with respect to maxima and minima toward smaller or larger @xmath72 values .",
    "this is not a surprise since all the reflection and transmission coefficients are complex quantities in general and the additional phase shifts are natural for each reflection at the interfaces .",
    "the entire interaction of sound waves at the core - sheet interface appears to be very complicated .",
    "the normal acoustic impedances @xmath125 and @xmath126 depend on both real and oscillating imaginary parts of @xmath76 and @xmath127 .",
    "as payne & cohn ( 1985 ) shown the instability coincides with vanishing ( in practice small ) values of denominator in expression for the reflection and transmission coefficients . in the case of core - sheet interface",
    "we have @xmath128 and even relatively small oscillations of these quantities result in strong oscillations of @xmath129 and @xmath130 around the averaged values typical for the sheet layer of infinite thickness .",
    "both the reflected and transmitted waves at the ( @xmath112 ) interface come back to this interface after a finite number of cycles returning the acoustic energy which has already been radiated in both directions .",
    "this returned energy results in the modified growth rate of the instability and again the growth rate influence the reflection and transmission coefficients at the ( @xmath112 ) interface . because of the multiplicity of interfaces , many waves interfere within the core - sheet jet configuration and the detailed description of these interactions seems to be a difficult task .",
    "=    =    we explored different sets of values for the densities , lorentz factor of the core and mach number of the sheet , for antisymmetric or symmetric solutions . in all chosen cases ,",
    "@xmath131 remains smaller than 1 , implying that no magnification of the waves occurs at the external interface .",
    "variation of the sheet mach number slightly shifts the oscillating pattern but does not modify the average growth rate as long as the sheet keeps a classical velocity .",
    "this statement is valid also in the case of sheet velocity exceeding the sheet sound speed ( @xmath132 ) as long as we assume that the core is relativistic and sheet is nonrelativistic .",
    "the main source of the instability comes from the internal interface where amplification of the waves can take place . generally speaking",
    ", the instability develops due to the interaction between the core and the sheet , with the oscillatory modification superimposed by the presence of the external ( @xmath113 ) interface .    for small @xmath74",
    ", when the effective thickness of the sheet is smaller than the half - wavelength , namely @xmath133 the growth rate for the stratified case resembles to the solution obtained for a single jet without sheet @xmath134 or appears as a kind of compromise between the two extreme cases of no sheet or infinite sheet .    for all studied sets of parameters",
    ", the temporal growth rate of the stratified jet instability tends to the solution obtained for the case of an infinite sheet or oscillates around it for large @xmath74 ( corresponding to large @xmath72 ) .",
    "oscillations are always reduced while increasing the sheet thickness .",
    "practically all solutions that we obtained converge to the case of infinite sheet as soon as @xmath135 reaches the order of 5 and often even less .",
    "so the presence of a sheet with a thickness of only a few times the core component radius imposes the growth rate of the instability .",
    "it is the physical parameters of the sheet relatively to the core medium which are decisive for the growth of the instability instead of the parameters of the external medium .",
    "an illustration of this is provided by fig .  2 and fig .  3 which show almost similar growth rate for the stratified scenario ( except for the inversion of the maxima and minima ) in spite of different values of the density ratio @xmath136 .",
    "the effect of the sheet that we study in the 2-dimensional slab geometry corresponds to the effect due to an envelope , a sheath or a cocoon around the jet in the cylindrical description .",
    "the general result that properties of the sheet essentially influence the linear growth of the kelvin - helmholtz instability have several consequences .",
    "it shows that the maximal growth rate and corresponding wavenumber can be modified by the presence of even a modest envelope .",
    "this is illustrated by the case of fig .  4 , where an envelope not very different from the core - component ( same thickness with @xmath137 , density ratio of @xmath138 ) induces an increase of @xmath139 from 0.03 to 0.2 and of @xmath140 from 0.1 to 1 for the fundamental mode .",
    "the linear growth of the helical mode of such a jet is therefore much faster and the resonant wavelength decreases to about @xmath141 .",
    "such modification due to the new complexity driven by the envelope - effect can help to solve some difficulties encountered when trying to deduce parameters such as densities and temperatures from the radio morphology of jets , under the assumption that knots and wiggles are respectively due to the growth of pinching and helical modes ( ferrari et al , 1983 ; zaninetti , van horn , 1988 ) .",
    "indeed , the parameters deduced in such studies for the external medium can be considered as applying only to an envelope surrounding the jet , with density and temperature possibly quite different from values deduced for instance from x - rays data on intergalactic gas .",
    "however the model of core - sheet jet is complex and involves much more free parameters which makes any model - dependent predictions more difficult .",
    "the determination of physical parameters of astrophysical jets based on the model of kelvin  helmholtz instability is a challenge , but it is also made difficult by our lack of detailed knowledge on the nonlinear evolution of the instability .",
    "several authors investigated the nonlinear regime by means of numerical simulations ( e.g. hardee et al .",
    "1992 , bodo et al .",
    "1994 ) in the case of nonrelativistic jets and applying analytical methods ( hanasz 1995 ) in the case of relativistic jets .",
    "the last approach shows that in the phase preceding the formation of shock waves within the relativistic jet , the growth of instability slows down while the perturbation amplitude grows and finally the growth is stopped for the amplitude of lateral displacement of the jet which is only a fraction of the jet radius .",
    "the physical reasons responsible for this behaviour can be summarized as a strong nonlinear growth of modulus of the acoustic impedances of both the internal ( relativistic ) and the surrounding ( nonrelativistic ) gases , associated with the growth of perturbation amplitude .",
    "the properties of the surrounding gas and the presence or absence of the sheet layer are important for the properties of the kelvin - helmholtz instability in this aspect as well .",
    "the numerical simulations allow to trace the evolution of perturbations up to the jet disruption .",
    "as bodo et al .",
    "( 1994 ) shown the time interval between the formation of first shock waves and the beginning of the mixing phase is dependent on the values of the mach number of the jet and the density contrast .",
    "according to this work the smaller density and higher mach number jets can survive in the form of laminar flow for a longer time .",
    "we would like to point out that in analogy to our previous results we can expect that the parameters of sheet in the case of stratified jets will control the life time of the laminar flow .",
    "coming back to the linear approximation we point out that the presence of an envelope underdense relatively to the external medium tends to induce faster growth of the instability while overdense envelope slows it down .",
    "the high stability of a large number of radio jets can therefore be better understood if dense and cool envelopes are commonly present , as expected in `` multilevel '' or two - component jet models ( smith , raine , 1985 ; baker et al , 1988 ; sol et al , 1989 ; achatz et al , 1990 ) .",
    "this could explain for instance the remarkable stability of the inner jet of the wide - angle tail ( wat ) radio source 3c465 .",
    "this source is hosted by the central galaxy of the cluster of galaxies abell 2634 .",
    "a hot intercluster gas makes the external medium in which the radio jet propagates .",
    "x - ray observations provided estimates of its temperature and density with distance to the core , @xmath142k and @xmath143  @xmath144 at 20  kpc ( eilek et al , 1984 ) . from faraday rotation measures , leahy ( 1984 ) suggested the existence of thermal plasma inside the jet with a density of @xmath145  @xmath144 in the inner hot spots at about 20  kpc from the core and of @xmath146  @xmath144 on average in the tails .",
    "we tentatively identify this thermal plasma with the sheet component of our study ( indeed in our description , the slow plasma of the sheet can also be present at @xmath147 , with the fast - moving plasma of the core just streaming through it ) . in two - flow models , the slow component ( here the sheet or envelope ) is made by a collimated wind coming from the accretion disc . assuming that its temperature is comparable to or less than the one of the gas in the disc at the basis of the outflow",
    ", one can expect a temperature in the range @xmath148k for the envelope , from the temperature variation proposed by phinney ( 1989 ) in the accretion discs .",
    "taking @xmath149 required @xmath150@xmath144 in the region of the inner hot spots to ensure pressure equilibrium with the intercluster gas at the external interface .",
    "such values of @xmath151 are quite in agreement with the faraday rotation analysis and correspond to an overdense envelope which tends to stabilize the inner jet structure .",
    "such type of envelopes could be present in many other extragalactic radio sources as proposed in an application of two - component jet models ( dole et al , 1995 ) and as suggested by the `` tomography '' analysis of radio data ( rudnick , 1995 ) .",
    "direct estimates of the envelope densities are not yet available .",
    "however the sheath detected by katz - stone and rudnick ( 1994 ) around the jet of the frii source cygnus a corresponds to an enhancement of the density of radiating particles , and therefore likely to an increase of the thermal plasma density as well .",
    "overdense sheaths would influence the dynamics of frii jets and increase their stability .",
    "a somewhat analogous role was already known to be played by frii cocoons .",
    "indeed numerical simulations emphasized the importance of a cocoon for the dynamics of frii jets ( norman et al , 1984a , b ) and identified two regimes , mode - dominated or cocoon - dominated .",
    "our study deal with laminar flows and can not precisely describe frii - cocoons which are turbulent .",
    "however it proposes some theoretical interpretation of the cocoon - dominated regime observed in numerical experiments .",
    "our results are analogous to the results obtained by hardee & norman ( 1990 ) , who notice that the jet dynamics is determined by properties of the jet and lobe , but not by the properties in the undisturbed medium . in their numerical simulations",
    "the lobe surrounds the jet in a manner resembling to our sheet or envelope .",
    "in fact , four different layers can be expected in such cases , namely the inner jet , the sheath , the cocoon and the external media . from our results on core - sheet jets",
    ", we tentatively infer that the stability properties of this highly stratified configuration will be dominated by the kelvin - helmholtz instability of the most unstable interface , likely the internal one if the inner jet is relativistic , slightly modified by the multiple reflections of the acoustic waves at the other interfaces .",
    "the question of the origin of sheaths or envelopes around extragalactic jets is still open .",
    "they can just emanate from the inner jets as the result of particle diffusion .",
    "this could concern the slow - moving radio `` cocoon '' of the jet in 3c273 .",
    "the interaction itself between the jet and its surroundings induces turbulent sheared and entrainment layers which can lead to the formation of sheaths for instance in fri sources . in frii sources ,",
    "the backflow from the hot spots constitutes some kind of sheaths as well , as already mentioned .",
    "other possibilities proposed by two - component models for jets are to generate stratified jets , inner cores and surrounding sheaths , directly from the central engines . in all these cases ,",
    "the presence of an envelope with thickness comparable or slightly larger than the central jet radius deeply modifies the interaction of the jet with the ambient medium of the host galaxy , and somewhat isolates the jet from its surroundings .",
    "this makes then rather problematic to explain the dichotomy between radio - loud and radio - quiet objects by the difference in the media where the jets have to propagate .",
    "such an argument of difference in the host galaxy interstellar medium is often proposed to account for the fact that well - developed radio jets are observed in elliptical galaxies but not in spiral and seyfert galaxies , based on the idea that jets are rapidly destroyed by their interaction with the dense and inhomogeneous interstellar gas expected in spiral galaxies .",
    "in fact , the interstellar medium can influence the radio source evolution in two ways , first by its direct interaction with the jet , second by its primordial role during the accretion process .",
    "our results favour the latter option since the former one appears easily inhibited by specific internal jet properties .",
    "within such a view , the dichotomy between radio - loud and radio - quiet objects should arise from specific properties of the central engine possibly acquired during its formation and accretion phase .",
