    "the umbra convection is characterized by horizontally small and vertically long convective cells , and slow flows @xcite .",

    "it is natural that the vertical magnetic field structure represents vertical flux tubes for a strong field ( figure  [ 3d - snapshots]a ) .",

    "results in only a small stretching of granules along the magnetic field lines @xcite .",
    "when the magnetic field inclination increases , the magnetic effects on the granulation dynamics are much stronger . in particular , the high inclination leads to strong , horizontal mean flows resembling the evershed effect @xcite and to formation of a filamentary structure in the form of strongly stretched convective cells , which become more narrow for the stronger field ( see two bottom rows in figure  [ in - snapshots ] ) .    such changes of the solar magnetoconvection , depending on the inclination and strength of the magnetic field , can also be reflected in the oscillatory behavior .",

    "we investigate effects of the magnetic field on the oscillations by calculating the power spectral density for the vertical velocity fluctuations , averaged over the whole horizontal domain .",
    "this corresponds to considering the radial oscillations or oscillations of a low angular degree with the horizontal wavelength much larger than the size of the computational domain ( 6  mm ) . because of the small domain of the simulations , we do not attempt to extract high - degree modes . for calculating the power spectra , we used 20  hours of the simulated data sets of the vertical velocity with a cadence of 30  seconds , after the magnetoconvection reached a stationary state .",
    "figures  [ pow - sp ]  b - c illustrate the power spectrum changes with increasing vertical magnetic field strength .",

    "the two identical top panels ( figure  [ pow - sp]a ) show the spectrum without magnetic field , for comparison . in the frequency range of @xmath12 mhz ,",
    "the power spectra have four mode peaks , the frequencies of which are determined by the resonant conditions between the bottom boundary conditions of our domain and the near - surface reflective layer . in this paper , we have not considered the high - frequency spectrum because the top boundary condition was reflecting .",
    "comparison of the oscillation spectra in figure  [ pow - sp ] shows three main dependencies : _ i _ ) suppression of the power by the magnetic field , _ ii _ ) shift of the mode peaks to a higher frequency , which is greater for the stronger field , and _",
    "iii _ ) increase of the width of the resonant peaks with the magnetic field . in the vertical field , @xmath6  g , the shift of the mode frequencies shows a trend to higher frequencies .",
    "the frequency shift increases in the stronger field , @xmath7  g. it is interesting that the power suppression is stronger for the vertical magnetic field than for the inclined field , but the frequency shift is significantly stronger for the inclined field than for the vertical field . also , the frequency dependence of the shift is stronger for the inclined magnetic field .",
    "the frequency shifts estimated from the positions of the peak maxima are shown in figure  [ shift ] .",
    "the dependence on the magnetic field strength seems to be nonlinear , in particular , for the two higher modes , but , obviously , this requires further investigation .    , panel a ) and almost horizontal ( @xmath3 , panel b ) magnetic fields . ]",
    "we have used radiative mhd simulations of magnetoconvection in the upper convective boundary layer and the low atmosphere of the sun to investigate changes in the oscillation power spectrum in the cases of vertical and highly inclined magnetic fields .",
    "the oscillations in these simulations are naturally excited by the turbulent convection .",
    "we have investigated only the behavior of the radial ( or large - scale ) oscillations .",
    "the results show two basic effects of the magnetic fields : power suppression and shifts of the mode peaks to higher frequencies . the power suppression is stronger for the vertical magnetic field , but the frequency shift is stronger for the inclined magnetic field .",
    "the stronger frequency shift in the inclined magnetic field can be understood in terms of physical properties of fast mhd waves .",
    "the speed of these waves is higher when they travel across the magnetic field lines , and this leads to higher modal frequencies .",
    "these results may have important implications for local helioseismology analysis and for comparison with linear modeling of oscillations in magnetic fields ( _ e.g. _ , ) .",
    "in particular , our results indicate that the frequency shift measured in sunspot regions using the ring - diagram technique of local helioseismology without discriminating the sunspot umbra and penumbra regions may come mostly from the penumbra because the contributions of various parts of the analyzed area are weighted by the local oscillation power of these parts ."
