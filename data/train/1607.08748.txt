    "a classic example is that of the evolution of the three types in a population of lizards of the species _",

    "the mixed - strategy nash equilibrium has been used to illustrate the price dispersion and the game itself to support the cyclic behaviour of prices ( set by a population of sellers or firms ) .",
    "the literature goes back at least to edgeworth @xcite , who predicted the existence of price cycles without mention of rsp . from the point of view of applications ,",
    "price cycles were observed by noel @xcite in the toronto retail gasoline market , where cycling among several price levels , from low to high and back again , is reported for major and independent firms . the use of the rsp game to model price dispersion can be found in hopkins and seymour @xcite , where the existence of price dispersion seems to depend on the absence of informed consumers . in laboratory experiments price cycling",
    "is reported in cason _",
    "_ @xcite and an experiment directed at illustrating cyclic behaviour in rsp can be found in cason _",
    "@xcite , where the issue of learning is present .",
    "learning is a natural environment for the use of the rsp game as it appears in the form of replicator dynamics . in @xcite , learning on the side of consumers prevents price dispersion .",
    "consumers choice of brands is mentioned by brgers and sarin @xcite as a possible application of reinforcement learning .",
    "the model of @xcite is further developed in lahkar and seymour @xcite to include the rsp game exhibiting local convergence to the interior rest point .    even though sometimes the seller perspective is in focus and other times the buyers point of view is taken , the applications are so far those of a single population of individuals rather than the strategic interaction of two ( or more ) individuals or populations .",
    "an exception to this is the work by friedman @xcite although his model is not by replicator dynamics . from a strictly abstract point of view , the interaction of individuals modelled by the rsp game has been addressed numerically by sato _",
    "_ @xcite and , building from this , analytically by aguiar and castro @xcite .    in this paper , we address stability of cyclic behaviour in the strategic interaction of two players of rsp .",
    "aguiar and castro @xcite show that the dynamics exhibit a heteroclinic network made of pairs of pure strategies and solutions connecting them in a suitable quotient space .",
    "this network can be seen as consisting of    * three cycles , one of which involves alternate win - loss of both players , and two involving a tie and loss by only one of the players ; * two cycles for which play goes through all possible combinations of outcomes in the two possible orders .",
    "we present a comprehensive study of the stability of the cycles in the rsp game , showing that this stability depends on the payoffs received for a tie , which we allow to vary in a range that makes a tie almost ( but not quite ) as good as a win or almost ( but not quite ) as bad as a loss .",
    "although cycles in a network can not be asymptotically stable , they can exhibit a strong type of stability , known as _ essential asymptotic stability _",
    ", first introduced by melbourne @xcite .",
    "we show that the cycle where players never tie is essentially asymptotically stable when the sum of payoffs for a tie is negative . in this case , a tie is not an attractive outcome for at least one of the players for whom the payoff is negative ( the payoffs for winning and losing are normalised to @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively ) and hence , as an outcome , it is avoided .",
    "our model allows for further development of strategic interaction in economics .",
    "the dynamics of the gasoline retail market in noel @xcite , show that the major and independent firms alternate in setting the highest price ( see figure 1 therein ) . if we assume that consumers buy at the lowest price , then major and independent firms alternate in winning and losing in an rsp game where the actions are `` fix lowest price '' , `` fix highest price '' and `` fix equal price '' .",
    "this corresponds to the win - loss cycle in ( a ) above . considering the pricing model of hopkins and seymour @xcite ,",
    "our rsp allows the introduction of the consumers as players by choosing to be `` uninformed '' , `` little - informed '' and `` well - informed '' .",
    "we discuss these models further in the final section .",
    "admittedly , the dynamics arising from the interaction of two players can be very complex and we do not attempt to find detailed specific applications .",
    "we do however hope that this first approach and its results can open the door to further research in this context .",
    "this article is organised as follows : the next section contains preliminary material which may be skipped by the reader familiar with the dynamics near heteroclinic networks .",
    "section  [ sec : rspgame ] describes the @xmath6-person rsp game and its cycles section  [ sec : transitions ] contains the necessary information to describe the trajectories of points near each cycle in the rsp network .",
    "this is then used in section  [ sec : stability ] to provide a thorough study of the stability of all the cycles in the dynamics of rsp .",
    "detailed calculations are deferred to an appendix .",
    "section  [ sec : applications ] suggests a possible first approach to an extension to two players of the models by noel @xcite and by hopkins and seymour @xcite .",
    "the last section concludes .",
    "consider a continuous - time dynamical system @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a smooth vector field .",
    "we say that @xmath10 is @xmath11-equivariant for some finite group @xmath11 acting orthogonally on @xmath12 if @xmath13 , for all @xmath14 and @xmath8 .",
    "then we say that @xmath14 is a symmetry of @xmath10 .",
    "background on differential equations with symmetry can be found in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11-orbit of @xmath8 is the set @xmath15 in particular , the elements in the @xmath11-orbit of an equilibrium for the flow of @xmath10 are also equilibria . a group orbit of equilibria is called a relative equilibrium .",

    "the set of all @xmath11-orbit of a subset @xmath21 is called the quotient space or orbit space . if @xmath22 is invariant under the flow of @xmath10 , then the flow of @xmath10 restricts to a flow on the quotient space so that @xmath22 can be reduce to the quotient space by identifying points in the same group orbit .",
    "a heteroclinic cycle is an invariant set @xmath23 which consist of an ordered set of hyperbolic equilibria @xmath24 for the flow of @xmath10 and trajectories @xmath25\\subset w^{\\textrm{u}}\\left(\\xi_{j}\\right)\\cap w^{\\textrm{s}}\\left(\\xi_{j+1}\\right)\\neq\\emptyset$ ] , @xmath26 , connecting them , where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are unstable and stable manifolds , respectively .",
    "a heteroclinic network is a connected union of finitely many heteroclinic cycles .    in general a connection between two saddles",
    "can be broken by arbitrarily small perturbations of @xmath10 , which makes the cycle structurally unstable .",
    "a suficient condition for preserving its structure relies on the existence of spaces invariant under the flow of @xmath10 where connections are of saddle - sink type .",
    "such a heteroclinic cycle is called robust .",
    "robust heteroclinic cycles arise naturally in equivariant systems ( e.g. @xcite ) as well as in game theory and population dynamics ( e.g. @xcite ) . in equivariant systems spaces of points fixed by the group action",
    "are naturally flow invariant . in the context of population dynamics",
    "such flow invariant spaces arise in the form of extinction hyperplanes .",
    "assume that for each @xmath26 there exists a flow invariant subspace @xmath30 such that @xmath31 is a hyperbolic saddle and @xmath32 is a hyperbolic sink in @xmath30 , and @xmath25\\subset p_{j}$ ] .",

    "even so , we take @xmath30 as the smallest linear subspace . set @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "obviously , @xmath35 .",
    "criteria for asymptotic and non - asymptotic stability of a heteroclinic cycle can be given in terms of the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix associated with the linearization of @xmath10 about each equilibrium .",
    "according to the geometry of the eigenspaces at @xmath31 , eigenvalues are divided into four classes , where @xmath36 denotes the orthogonal complement in @xmath37 of the subspace @xmath38 :    * radial eigenvalues @xmath39 with associated eigenvectors in @xmath40 ; * contracting eigenvalues @xmath41 with associated eigenvectors in @xmath42 ; * expanding eigenvalues @xmath43 with associated eigenvectors in @xmath44 ; * transverse eigenvalues @xmath45 with associated eigenvectors in @xmath46 .",
    "we set @xmath47 for @xmath48 , @xmath49 for @xmath50 , @xmath51 for @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath54 , such that @xmath55 .",
    "we focus on the case in which eigenvalues are all real . the numbers @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are positive but @xmath59 can be either positive or negative . before a heteroclinic network ,",
    "the type of the eigenvalue at each equilibrium is determined by the cycle taken into account .",
    "for example , an eigenvalue may be contracting with respect to one cycle and transverse with respect to another cycle .",
    "the issue of stability for robust heteroclinic cycles has been a subject of interest .",
    "prominent results for asymptotic stability were established by krupa and melbourne @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , numerical simulations reveal that a heteroclinic cyle may have strong attractivity properties even though it is not asymptotically stable .",
    "then several forms of non - asymptotic stability have been employed as essentially asymptotic stability and fragmentarily asymptotic stability .",
    "this is particularly appropriate for cycles put together in a heteroclinic network since none of them can be asymptotically stable . in fact an equilibrium common to more than one cycle always admits an unstable direction with respect to one of the cycles to which it belongs .",
    "let @xmath23 be a compact set invariant under the flow , @xmath60 , associated to @xmath10 and @xmath61 .",
    "following the terminology of @xcite , we denote by @xmath62 an @xmath63-neighbourhood of @xmath64 .",

    "an important feature of the stability index is that it is constant along trajectories of the flow .",

    "making use of recent developments in the study of dynamical systems , particularly in the study of stability of heteroclinic cycles , we classify all the cycles of the rsp game according to their stability as a function of two parameters .",

    "the corresponding situation when the sum of payoffs for a tie is positive is not as stable , although it does exhibit some intermediate level of stability .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that if the players oscillate between a tie and a win for one ( same ) player , then the player that never wins is not very happy with the situation and tries to deviate .",
    "these results are consistent with numerical simulations and experiments referred throughout the current work and may help to clarify empirical examples of the rsp cycles discovered in nature and economy .",
    "we note that our rsp game is not necessarily zero - sum , taking into account sigmund s @xcite concern that `` for most types of social and economic interactions , the assumption that the interests of the two players are always diametrically opposite does not hold . '' in particular , the payoff matrices reflect asymmetry which is a feature that arises either in interpopulation or intrapopulation interactions .",
    "social and economic dilemmas between consumers and sellers , firms and workers are examples of situations where agents frequently adopt asymmetric positions .",
