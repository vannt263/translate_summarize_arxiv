    "hydrodynamics has been rather successful at describing data obtained in relativistic nuclear collisions at rhic .",
    "usually , smooth initial conditions are assumed ( see e.g. fig.1 in @xcite and fig.3 in @xcite . on the other side , microscopic codes such as nexus predict initial conditions event - by - event , which are quite irregular as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the question we address here is whether such structures ( hot spots or more precisely hot tubes ) can have a sizable effect on variables .    to solve the hydro equations with very irregular initial conditions",
    ", we use the spherio code .",
    "this code is based on the method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics , originally developed in astrophysics and adapted to relativistic heavy ion collisions in @xcite .",
    "the version of nexspherio used here has initial conditions provided by nexus @xcite and normalized by an @xmath0-dependent factor to reproduce @xmath1 in each centrality window @xcite .",
    "the equation of state has a critical point @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 is fixed ( mostly ) by @xmath3 and depends on the centrality window ( i.e. number of participants ) .",
    "centrality windows are defined using participant number and not impact parameter @xcite .",
    "an ideal fluid is assumed , a code with smoothed particle hydrodynamics and dissipation is under development @xcite .",
    "in the following , we present a summary of results obtained using smooth initial conditions and running once the spherio hydro code ( standard approach ) or using a set of nexus initial conditions , running for each initial conditions the spherio hydro code and computing averages over the set for various observables ( event - by - event hydrodynamics ) .      as can be seen in figure 2 ( left ) , the high @xmath4 part is lifted .",
    "this is expected since hot tubes must expand more violently , producing more high @xmath4 particles @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 is flatter as seen in figure 2 ( centre ) .",
    "this is also expected as the isotropic expansion of hot tubes produces more high @xmath4 particles and lowers @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath6 has no shoulder @xcite as seen in figure 2 ( right ) .",
    "the effects ( isentropic expansion ) of the hot tubes are more visible in regions of lower matter density present at larger @xmath0 s @xcite .      in @xcite , we argued that the hot tubes should manifest themselves giving smaller hbt radii .",
    "however , the situation might be more complicated .",
    "another observable where hot tubes might manifest themselves is the ridge , a structure observed in the 2 particle correlations , plotted as function of pseudorapitity difference @xmath7 and azimutal angle difference @xmath8 between a high @xmath4 trigger hadron and its associated hadrons ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the structure is @xmath7 independent . in nexspherio",
    ", the hot tubes can lead to such a ridge for the e - by - e initial conditions and not the smooth ones @xcite .",
    "finally , the fluctuations in the e - b - e initial conditions also manifest themselves in fluctuations of @xmath9 ( as well as @xmath10 ) . the predicted values for @xmath9 at 130 a gev @xcite and estimates at 200 a gev @xcite are in agreement with data @xcite .",
    "improvements to remove the non - flow effects have been reported by star and phobos , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present some new _ preliminary _ results obtained with nexspherio on directed flow .      if a nucleus - nucleus collision is a number of independent nucleon - nucleon collisions , the momentum distribution is isotropic .",
    "if instead , it leads to thermalized matter in the overlap region , the momentum distribution is stretched along the impact parameter direction , @xmath9 is a measure of this stretching ( so teaches about ic , thermalization , etc ) .",
    "there is also the possibility that the momentum distribution be shifted / deformed towards one of the sides in the x - y plane , @xmath10 is a measure of this shift .    at some energy , a `` wiggle '' in @xmath11 is predicted . in some microscopical models such as rqmd and urqmd",
    ", this could be the case for nucleons at rhic energy @xcite . in hydro models",
    ", this could be the case for the fluid , if a qgp phase occurs @xcite .    at sps energy",
    "( 40 a gev and 158 a gev ) , it was shown @xcite that pions and protons behave oppositely .",
    "pion directed flow as function of rapidity has no wiggle and crosses y=0 with a negative slope while nucleon directed flow has no wiggle and crosses y=0 with a positive slope ( except perhaps at the higher energy , in the more peripheral bin , where there is a hint of wiggle ) .      at rhic ,",
    "directed flow for charged particles is rather similar to what was obtained at sps for pions : it crosses @xmath12 with a negative slope @xcite .",
    "this is understandable since charged particles are mostly pions , the fluid directed flow must be dominated by pions .",
    "the turnover in @xmath11 occurs for different values of @xmath0 in phobos and in star ( see below ) .",
    "results for identified particles are becoming available @xcite .",
    "in addition , comparison of results for directed flow in cu+cu and au+au collisions show no system - size dependence @xcite .",
    "nexspherio results are in qualitative agreement with phobos for all @xmath0 s and quantitative agreement for @xmath13 ( figure 3 left ) .",
    "they are in qualitative agreement with star for @xmath14 but turnover occurs for smaller @xmath0 than for star ( figure 3 right ) .",
    "@xmath11 from nexspherio for various centrality windows for au+au and cu+cu at 200 a gev is shown in figure 4 .",
    "little dependence on a is seen in the windows 6 - 15% to 45 - 55% .",
    "statistics must be improved .",
    "+    figure 5 ( left ) illustrates particle dependence . in nexspherio",
    ", protons have a big wiggle , pions have a plateau ( left ) .",
    "a similar result was obtained using urqmd @xcite . in figure 5 (",
    "right ) , it is seen that @xmath11 has a plateau for fluctuating initial conditions and a somewhat stronger negative inclination for smooth initial conditions .",
    "a short review of possible effects of fluctuating initial conditions , rather than smooth ones , was presented .",
    "in addition to providing a reasonable description of various observables , as is possible with smooth initial conditions , some new effects were listed , most notably the ridge effect and the @xmath9 fluctuations , which do not appear when using the smooth initial conditions .    99 t.hirano phys.rev.c65 ( 2001 ) 011901r c.nonaka and s.bass phys.rev.c75 ( 2007 ) 014902 c.e.aguiar , t.kodama , t.osada@xmath15&@xmath15y.hama , j.phys.g27(2001)75 ;",
