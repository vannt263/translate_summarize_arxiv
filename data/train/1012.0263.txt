    "two dimensional electronic systems on a honeycomb lattice have seen tremendous activity over the last couple of years .",
    "this development was triggered by the experimental isolation of single layer graphene which comes with a variety of fascinating and unusual properties  @xcite .",
    "commonly , graphene is considered an excellent conductor with extremely high mobilities  @xcite . the effective low - energy theory describing the system",
    "is given in terms of massless dirac fermions moving at the fermi velocity @xmath0 instead of the speed of light @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "most of the experimental findings in graphene to date can be explained in terms of weakly interacting massless dirac quasiparticles  @xcite .",
    "a most prominent exception is provided by the recently observed fractional quantum hall effect  @xcite .    despite this predominant lack of signatures of correlation effects ,",
    "many authors have analyzed the role of local and long - range coulomb interaction and possible interaction driven insulating phases  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study transport in the vicinity of a semimetal - to - insulator quantum phase transition , in which the opening of the single - particle gap in the insulating phase is driven by spontaneous sublattice symmetry breaking .",
    "the sublattice inversion symmetry breaking is driven by collective instabilities of the charge density or spin density wave type .",
    "note that this scenario does not describe the mott transition in the traditional sense due to the additional symmetry breaking  @xcite . in that sense",
    "the treatment presented here is closer to the excitonic insulator obtained due to long - range coulomb interaction and chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite than it is to a pure hubbard model . within this paper",
    "we analyze the simplest possible transition from a semimetal to an insulator described by a hubbard like model and discard the possible existence of interesting intermediate phases such as a spin liquid phase  @xcite .",
    "transport properties at quantum - criticality have traditionally been a very active branch of research in strongly correlated matter . in two dimensions",
    "microscopic calculations have been performed with the quantum - critical conductivity being given by a temperature independent universal number  @xcite .",
    "this has to be expected for dimensional reasons if the critical point of the field theory has relativistic invariance and is located at finite interaction strength .    in the context of clean intrinsic graphene , which shares a number of characteristics with a quantum - critical system  @xcite",
    ", the critical conductivity was shown to diverge in logarithmic manner upon lowering temperature  @xcite .",
    "this behavior is rooted in the renormalization group fixed point of the system lying at zero interaction , with the interaction parameter describing long - range coulomb interaction being marginally irrelevant , thus flowing to zero logarithmically upon lowering the energy scale .    in our problem ,",
    "the insulating phase is characterized by the presence of collective order of charge density ( cdw ) or spin density wave ( sdw ) type  @xcite .",
    "the finite order parameter acts like a mass term for the dirac fermions and consequently opens a gap in the electronic excitation spectrum .",
    "both sorts of long - range order break sublattice inversion ( @xmath3 ) symmetry ( conventionally referred to as chiral symmetry ) , which is the driving force behind the finite electronic gap .",
    "sdw additionally breaks spin rotation symmetry ( su(@xmath4 ) ) .    within this paper",
    "we choose a simple field theoretic formulation of the gross - neveu type  @xcite , which captures the collective instability and the opening of the electronic quasiparticle gap .",
    "we consider two related formulations : ( i ) a landau - ginzburg type bosonic order parameter theory coupled to dirac fermions via a yukawa - type coupling ( henceforth referred to as model i ) and ( ii ) a locally interacting theory of dirac fermions ( henceforth referred to as model ii ) . in both cases there",
    "is a quantum phase transition of the semimetal - to - insulator type , which is second order and described by an interacting fixed point . in both cases an appropriate order parameter",
    "can easily be defined , which is zero in the semimetallic phase and finite in the insulating phase .",
    "thinking in terms of the landau - ginzburg description of phase transitions , the order parameter symmetry is @xmath5 with @xmath6 ( ising or @xmath3 ) for cdw and @xmath7 ( heisenberg ) for sdw .    microscopically",
    ", local interactions can trigger these instabilities : on - site coulomb repulsion favors sdw , whereas repulsion between adjacent sites favors cdw .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] sketches a phase diagram with the vertical axis being temperature and the horizontal axis the local interaction parameter .",
    "the strength of local repulsion , denoted @xmath8 , serves as tuning parameter for the quantum phase transition . in the case of a quantum phase transition towards cdw",
    ", @xmath8 denotes repulsive interaction between adjacent sites , whereas for the case of a transition towards sdw the repulsion is on - site .",
    "our analysis proceeds along the lines of a combination of a semiclassical boltzmann equation combined with renormalization group arguments ( model i ) and a large - n expansion ( model ii )  @xcite . throughout the paper all mathematical expressions",
    "are explicitly shown for the cdw case .",
    "the sdw expressions differ in combinatorial factors due to the difference in order parameter symmetry , but not in their structure . however , qualitative differences occur at finite temperature due to the absence of long - range order in the sdw case . in the cdw case a finite gap in the electronic excitation spectrum is stable at finite temperatures , whereas there is no hard gap for the sdw .",
    "this is discussed in great detail in the conclusions .",
    "we calculated the quantum - critical minimal conductivity of graphene at the semimetal - to - insulator transition using two different phenomenological models .",
    "furthermore , we estimated crossover functions for the conductivity which obtain upon lowering temperature and entering the semimetal or respectively the insulating phase .",
    "most interestingly , we estimate the crossover function for the quantum - critical - to - insulator crossover and compare it to experimental data in graphene .    considering two slightly distinct models we find seemingly contrasting transport properties :    \\(1 ) within model i in contrast to other relativistically invariant critical points at finite interaction strength in two dimensional systems , the d.c . conductivity is not independent of temperature , but",
    "instead seemingly diverges upon lowering temperature  @xcite .",
    "this surprising result obtains because of a conspiracy of matrix elements and kinematical constraints which prohibits electronic current relaxation from the yukawa coupling to _ all _ orders in perturbation theory .",
    "this statement , however , is only strictly true if the electrons and bosons are treated as sharp quasiparticles at all times .",
    "it turns out that the minimal conductivity ( at charge neutrality ) is eventually determined by a marginally irrelevant operator , namely long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "the critical transport to leading order in temperature turns out to be identical to that of a gas of hot dirac electrons interacting solely via long - range coulomb interaction  @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) within model ii we find a universal temperature independent universal conductivity as has to be expected from dimensional reasoning .",
    "however , we find that the prefactor of the inverse relaxation time is extremely small compared to the one associated with the marginally irrelevant long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "in contrast to model i , the scattering from the cdw ( sdw ) order parameter fluctuations is not completely inactive , but still extremely small .",
    "a simple order of magnitude estimate suggests that for all experimental purposes the universal quantum - critical conductivity is masked by the current relaxation due to long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "we comment on the seeming discrepancy between the transport properties of model i and model ii and argue that the two different pictures are actually compatible and describe the same basic physics , with model i overestimating the kinematical blocking .    on a more technical note another interesting result obtains within model i , in which bosons and fermions are directly coupled , namely the absence of boson - drag effects for the coupled boltzmann equations .",
    "boson - drag constitutes a serious complication in obtaining transport coefficients in field theories of electrons coupled to bosons , where the bosons are an effective degree of freedom , whose dynamics itself is governed by the underlying electrons .",
    "an often employed approximation for the calculation of electronic transport properties in such systems is that the bosonic system is assumed to be equilibrated on timescales relevant for electronic transport and drag effects are neglected .",
    "this approximation turns out to be exact in our case .    finally , the crossover behavior of the conductivity for the the quantum - critical - to - insulator crossover is discussed for both forms of collective ordering , namely the cdw and sdw . as we argued before , in the case of cdw an ising degree of freedom condenses , which is allowed at finite temperature .",
    "thus the electronic degrees of freedom have a hard gap , which entails an exponentially suppressed conductivity .",
    "in the case of the sdw , on the other hand , a real quasiparticle gap only opens at temperature @xmath9 and finite temperature behavior is not governed by a hard gap , but rather by a `` pseudogap '' , leading to a power - law suppression of the conductivity .",
    "both scenarios allow to determine crossover curves which show remarkable similarities to experiments performed on suspended high - mobility graphene samples  @xcite .",
    "it appears that they are qualitatively and quantitatively widely compatible with a recent analysis of the data sets under the hypothesis of an underlying electronic quasiparticle gap and might thus be a natural starting point for the identification of the fitting parameters discussed in ref .  .",

    "we explicitly show that in this system of coupled transport equations neglecting the effect of `` boson - drag '' is _ exact _ to linear order in the applied electric field and proceed to analyze the boltzmann equation for the massless dirac particles .",

    "spontaneous symmetry breaking leads to a gap in the electronic single - particle excitation spectrum .",
    "we concentrate on order parameters which break the sublattice inversion symmetry , _ i.e. _ , the two sites per unit cell become chemically distinguishable .",
    "two possible instabilities correspond to charge - density wave ( cdw ) and spin - density wave ( sdw ) states , whose order parameters in terms of electronic operators read @xmath22 where @xmath23 acts in spin space and is simply a vector composed of pauli matrices . in the above representation",

    "the following discussions we generalize the model to @xmath28 dimensions and adopt a lagrangian formulation .",
    "the generalization to @xmath28 dimensions eventually allows to treat the bosonic and fermionic sectors on an equal footing in a perturbative renormalization group treatment .",
    "we generalize the dirac hamiltonian to three dimensions such that matrix elements have a structure like in two dimensions : on a technical level this implies that we evaluate angular integrals as if they were in two dimensions , but keep the integrals over absolute values in @xmath28 dimensions .",
    "the following discussion closely mimics the main steps of ref .  .",
    "we decompose the local interaction into separate dynamical fields via hubbard - stratonovich decoupling and formulate the effective action near the semimetal - to - insulator transition as @xmath29 , with @xmath30 , where the bosonic part is described by @xmath31 and the yukawa term that couples bosonic and fermionic fields reads @xmath32 we note that @xmath33 describes the cdw fluctuation mode , where @xmath34 is the tuning parameter , @xmath35 the self - interaction , and @xmath36 the velocity .",

    "interestingly , the above gross - neveu theory is renormalizable in @xmath40 dimensions , where _ both _ the yukawa coupling @xmath41 and the self - interaction coupling @xmath35 become dimensionless .",
    "it is then possible to study the effective yukawa theory in @xmath42 dimensions using renormalization group ( rg ) methods with @xmath27 being the control parameter for the perturbative series ( @xmath43 corresponds to the two - dimensional model ) .",

    "the correct theory thus is described by electrons and bosons .",
    "a simple order parameter theory would not suffice to describe the physics correctly , since there the critical point would essentially be given by wf .    in the above picture",
    "we have assumed the equivalence of bosonic and fermionic velocities , _",
    "i.e. _ , lorentz invariance . a closer look at the theory reveals that this is only asymptotically correct and breaking the relativistic invariance actually corresponds to an irrelevant perturbation with respect to the fixed point smi .",

    "it is thus also important to understand the role of long - range coulomb interaction at smi . in order to do",
    "this one has to generalize the coulomb interaction to @xmath28 dimension following ref .",
    "@xmath59 this form ensures that integration over @xmath60 induces a @xmath61 density - density interaction between fermions in any dimension .",
    "it is found  @xcite that coulomb interaction obeys the following rg equation @xmath62 one observes that our choice of @xmath63 ( eq .  ) indeed produces a marginally irrelevant long - range interaction in any dimension .",
    "this establishes long - range coulomb interaction as the least irrelevant coupling at smi .",

    "@xcite and we only repeat one key feature .",
    "a prediction of the field theory is that right at the quantum - critical point the fermion propagator behaves as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the anomalous dimension . in this sense",
    "there are no well - defined fermionic quasiparticles at the critical point .",
    "however , it was shown by damle and sachdev  @xcite that a boltzmann transport analysis in terms of quasiparticles still captures the relevant physics in the hydrodynamic regime ( @xmath66 ) . in that sense",
    "the semiclassical boltzmann equation only constitutes a convenient starting point to solve the more complicated quantum - boltzmann equation , which we refrain from showing in full bloom in this paper .      in the following we consider an alternative formulation of the physics described above .",

    "@xmath80 represents a quantum - critical point , where for @xmath81 runaway flow into a phase with broken chiral symmetry , _ i.e. _ , @xmath82 obtains .",
    "this model represents an alternative starting point for studying the critical transport properties in the framework of the boltzmann equation .      without going into the details of the derivation  @xcite we simply state that the effect of long - range coulomb interaction has also been studied in the context of this model in the limit of large - n . in order to do so",
    "the coulomb interaction   for @xmath83 is equally generalized to large @xmath71 and the flow equation of the charge reads @xmath84 which confirms that the long - range coulomb interaction is marginally irrelevant , in qualitative agreement with eq .   from model i and ref .",
    "we close this section with a generic comment about recent numerical simulations performed for dirac fermions with only long - range interactions in terms of a lattice gauge theory simulation .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that even without short - range interactions a quantum phase transitions as a function of the fine - structure constant can be driven from a semimetal to an insulator , where in the insulating phase chiral symmetry is observed to be broken .",
    "this transition happens at a critical value of the fine structure constant and numerical values for this critical coupling come close to the value expected in vacuum . within numerical accuracy",
    "the transition proves to be second order and more remarkably the critical exponents seem compatible with the above two models with short - range interactions exclusively .",
    "we note that for a purely hubbard type model there has been a recent work discussing the mott transition which is not driven by collective symmetry breaking , but a transition into an intermediate paramagnetic spin liquid phase is observed  @xcite . only upon increasing the local interaction the model has a transition into an antiferromagnetic phase . the nature of this spin liquid phase is currently not fully understood and not subject of our discussion .",
    "the boltzmann transport equation in combination with rg methods and large - n has proven a valuable tool in analyzing transport properties of quantum - critical systems  @xcite . in this section",
    "we introduce the basic notation and concepts for the calculation of the critical conductivity following closely ref .  .",

    "the operator @xmath97 is not shown explicitly ; it describes the creation of a quasiparticle - quasihole pair ( it corresponds to the so - called zitterbewegung , see ref .  )    as in the problems studied in refs .  ,",
    "in a particle - hole symmetric situation a current carrying state with holes and electrons moving in opposite directions has a vanishing total momentum and the current can decay by creation or annihilation of particle - hole pairs without violating momentum conservation .",
    "this is the physical reason why at the particle - hole symmetric point , _ i.e. _ , at vanishing deviation of the chemical potential from the dirac point , the d.c .",
    "conductivity is finite even in the absence of momentum relaxing impurities .",

    "i.e. _ , in the absence of external perturbations , the distribution functions are fermi functions @xmath101where we temporarily allow for a finite chemical potential @xmath102 .    in principle ,",
    "off - diagonal elements such as @xmath103 are also created by an electric field . however , they are not needed to evaluate @xmath104 , which is the part of the current that we focus on in the hydrodynamic regime , @xmath105 .",
    "furthermore , the off - diagonal elements feed back to the kinetic equation of the diagonal elements only to higher order in perturbation theory . in the presence of an external electric field @xmath106 acting as a driving force on quasielectrons and quasiholes , we find the semiclassical boltzmann equation @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the scattering integral .",

    "being asymmetric under @xmath113 , and thus the solution has to be asymmetric as well .",
    "this reflects the fact that there is an increased number of quasiholes and quasiparticles moving parallel and antiparallel to the exciting field , respectively . as quasiparticles and -holes have opposite charges , their electrical currents are equal and add up , while their net momenta have opposing signs and subtract to yield zero . in this paper",
    "we consider instabilities , which do not break particle - hole symmetry , and thus the above parametrization is strictly justified .",
    "we can formulate the boltzmann equation for the electrons and holes ( we only show the equation for the electrons ; for holes it follows by symmetry ) to lowest order in the electron - boson coupling as    @xmath114    where @xmath115 with @xmath116 @xmath117 is the bosonic propagator   and @xmath118 the bose distribution function .",
    "there exists an analogous equation for the bosonic degrees of freedom . since the bosons do not couple to the electromagnetic field , the driving term ( l.h.s . )",
    "is exactly zero .",
    "however , the scattering integral couples the non - equilibrium fermions to the bosons constraining the bosonic distribution function to solve    @xmath119    this bosonic boltzmann equation   has to be solved simultaneously with the fermionic one  . in principle , there is also a boson only scattering term coming from the self - interaction ( @xmath120-term )  @xcite .",
    "this term is not shown explicitly for reasons of conciseness .",
    "it turns out that its neglect proves to be exact in the case at hand .",
    "this is rooted in the fact that the bosons remain in equilibrium , which is shown explicitly below .",
    "severe complications in calculating electromagnetic response functions in systems in which fermions and collective ( slave-)bosons are coupled to each other result from the fact that one has to solve coupled boltzmann equations ( eq .",
    "and eq .  ) .",
    "the physical reason for that is simple : electrons transfer momentum to the bosons , which themselves are driven out of equilibrium . since the bosons also scatter from the fermions , there is a feedback effect which in principle has to be taken seriously .",
    "often this is circumvented by assuming the bosonic sector to be in equilibrium , which is equivalent to saying that the bosonic sector equilibrates due to lattice effects or impurities on a time scale faster than the electronic scattering time .",
    "this can be an oversimplifying assumption with no _ a priori _ justification .",
    "one can appreciate this most easily by considering a galilean invariant electronic system interacting with effective bosonic modes .",
    "in this situation neglecting the generic non - equilibrium situation for the bosonic sector yields fundamentally wrong results , namely a _ finite _ d.c .",
    "one can convince oneself that taking into account the boltzmann equation for the bosons reestablishes the physically correct result of infinite d.c .",

    "we now turn our attention to eq .   and expand the fermionic and bosonic distribution functions to linear order in the applied external field @xmath121 using eq .  .",
    "for the bosonic sector we stick to the symbolic @xmath122 with @xmath123 being linear in the applied field and @xmath124 as the equilibrium bose distribution function .",
    "a simple analysis shows that @xmath125 drops out of eq .   and",
    "the remaining parts annihilate exactly , as they should for consistency .",
    "the above scattering integral is thus solved exactly by letting @xmath126 and using eq .",
    "for the fermions .",
    "we have thus shown that at the dirac point the boson - drag vanishes exactly and considering the bosons in thermodynamic equilibrium is exact .",
    "one can convince oneself that in a situation with finite chemical potential @xmath102 this ceases to be true and the bosons have to be treated as being out of equilibrium .",
    "in such a situation a finite amount of disorder is needed to relax the net momentum and the associated current .",
    "we have thus established that in clean graphene at @xmath11 the bosonic sector remains in equilibrium .",
    "we can understand this more intuitively as follows : we first consider an electronic band with quadratic dispersion interacting with phonons .",
    "in this situation the bosonic sector absorbs some momentum from the electrons which scatter and is itself driven out of equilibrium . in graphene",

    "both mechanisms result in a diverging resistivity at low temperatures .",
    "obviously , there are additional other scattering sources , which could play a role .",
    "it turns out that phonons due to the high fermi velocity play a role at rather elevated temperatures ( @xmath212 ) and thus are not a candidate to modify the above picture of the transport characteristics  @xcite .",
    "another candidate would be the corrugation or ripples which are observed in suspended graphene .",
    "it turns out that on a formal level ripples share some characteristics with long - range coulomb interaction . to our knowledge",
    "no thorough study of the effect of ripples on the conductivity in suspended graphene exists to date and a detailed analysis is called for  @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude this discussion by stating that a proximity of free standing graphene to a quantum - critical point for a transition from the semimetal to an insulator described in this note could provide a natural explanation for the ( temperature ) behavior of the resistivity observed in the experiment of bolotin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on ultraclean high - mobility samples .",
    "this , however , would also imply that signatures of collective symmetry breaking of the sdw or cdw type should be observable in those samples , which to my knowledge has not been attempted .",
    "this provides a necessary independent check of the scenario of graphene in vacuum being an excitonic insulator .",

    "<S> in this paper we study transport properties of electrons on the two - dimensional honeycomb lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a half - filled system in the vicinity of a symmetry - breaking transition from a semimetallic phase towards an insulating phase with either charge density or spin density wave order . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of either order is to break the sublattice inversion symmetry which induces a finite gap for the electronic single - particle excitations . </S>",
    "<S> phenomenologically , such a scenario is described in the framework of a gross - neveu theory . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze two related formulations of the model by means of ( i ) a controlled renormalization group calculation and ( ii ) the large - n method , both of which in combination with a boltzmann transport equation . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the quantum - critical conductivity and also discuss crossover behavior from quantum critical behavior into the insulating and/or the semimetallic phases . </S>",
    "<S> we find that at asymptotically low temperatures the quantum - critical conductivity is given by a temperature independent universal number . over a large temperature window </S>",
    "<S> the temperature independent quantum critical conductivity is masked by a logarithmically temperature dependent contribution due to the marginally irrelevant long - range coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible origins of this peculiarity in the two complementary formulations of the model . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we consider possible relations of our findings to recent experiments , with a special emphasis on the quantum - critical - to - insulator crossover . we find that our results are in remarkably good qualitative and quantitative agreement with a recent analysis of the data sets under the hypothesis of an underlying gap in the single - particle spectrum . </S>"
