    "how deterministic classical mechanics ( cm ) emerges from probabilistic quantum mechanics ( qm ) is a conundrum which is yet to be resolved .",
    "as first noticed by dirac@xcite , the poisson brackets of cm can be considered the @xmath3 limit of commutators in qm , and the heisenberg equation goes over to hamilton s equation in that limit : @xmath4 \\qquad\\xrightarrow{\\hbar\\rightarrow 0}\\qquad \\dfrac{da}{dt } \\;=\\ ; \\{\\,a,\\,h\\,\\}\\;.\\ ] ] despite this formal correspondence , however , it is far from clear how the full classical theory would be recovered from qm in such a limit . in particular , what happens to the hilbert space of qm in the @xmath3 limit is a difficult question .",
    "limit has been emphasized in an illuminating review by berry@xcite . ] also , @xmath5 being a dimensionful quantity , the limit @xmath3 itself is not particularly well - defined .",
    ", the @xmath3 limit should be understood as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the classical action that is used to describe the quantum formulation as , say , in the path integral approach . ]    in order to see the cm@xmath8qm correspondence more clearly , several attempts have been made to make cm look more like qm via the introduction of wave - functions , operators , and probability distributions .",
    "the wkb approximation@xcite to the schrdinger equation has been reinterpreted as the wave - function of cm by van vleck@xcite and subsequently by schiller,@xcite with observables represented by commuting hermitian operators with continuous eigenvalues . however , utilizing the rewriting of the schrdinger equation by de  broglie in his pilot - wave theory,@xcite which was later elaborated on by bohm to discuss a hidden variable interpretation of qm,@xcite rosen has shown that taking the @xmath3 limit of the schrdinger equation does not necessarily recover the hamilton - jacobi equation for superpositions of states.@xcite    koopman@xcite and von  neumann@xcite , and later sudarshan@xcite , developed a complete formulation of cm on a hilbert space , which was again characterized by commuting hermitian operators as observables .",
    "recent work on extending the koopman - von neumann - sudarshan formalism with the introduction of path integrals , etc .",
    "include refs .  .",
    "it should be emphasized that the koopman - von neumann - sudarshan theory is not the @xmath3 limit of qm .",
    "indeed , the operators that correspond to position and momentum in their formalism commute with each other without the taking of any limit , and respectively have canonically conjugate operators with which they do not commute but are deemed unobservable .",
    "the superposition of states also correspond to ensembles of classical states , and not macroscopic schrdinger - cat like states .",
    "thus , though the koopman - von neumann - sudarshan theory is a formulation of cm on a hilbert space , it does not ( yet ) provide much insight on how cm can emerge from qm , or vice versa .",
    "given the apparent absence of macroscopic schrdinger - cat like states , they must somehow vanish in the classical limit .",
    "several approaches have been used to address this problem , the most prominent being that of ` environmental decoherence ' reviewed in refs .   by zurek . there , the system under observation and its environment ( rest of the universe ) are both treated quantum mechanically , and it has been shown that the interaction between the two suppresses the off - diagonal terms in the density matrix in a preferred basis .",
    "the statistical nature of the theory remains , however , and leads to the many - worlds interpretation of qm developed from the pioneering work of everett@xcite .",
    "other approaches to the system - environment interaction problem treat the environment classically , and the interaction with the quantum system leads to classical - quantum ` hybrid ' theories , the properties of which are still under investigation .    thus , despite impressive developments in our understanding of qm during the past century , the cm / qm divide remains and bridging that gap is still an intense area of investigation .",
    "what seems probable is that recovering cm from qm would require more than taking the @xmath3 limit of qm in some yet to be discovered way , or the rewriting of cm or qm to look more like the other in some fashion .",
    "a more generic theory which encompasses both cm and qm may be necessary to understand the cm@xmath8qm correspondence .    as with any difficult problem , finding a toy analog which simplifies the situation while maintaining the essence of the quandary is often instructive . in refs .",
    "and we constructed a toy analog of @xmath9-level qm on the vector space @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the galois field of order @xmath12 , with @xmath13 prime and @xmath14 , which we dubbed `` galois field quantum mechanics '' ( gqm ) .",
    "gqm was necessarily different from canonical qm in many ways , due to the vector space @xmath10 not possessing an inner product .",
    "consequently , observables were not represented by operators , hermiticity being difficult to define without an inner product , and without operators there were no commutators , or @xmath5 for that matter .",
    "however , in it , physical states were still represented by elements of a projective geometry , and the theory still predicted probabilities of the outcomes of a measurement which could not be mimicked by any hidden variable theory .",
    "thus gqm , despite being constructed on a discrete and finite vector space @xmath10 without an inner product , nevertheless captured some of the quantum - ness of canonical qm .",
    "a natural question to ask then is : does gqm have a ` classical ' limit in which this quantum - ness is lost and replaced by classical - ness ?",
    "an answer to this could help us understand how canonical qm becomes cm also .",
    "in this paper , we present the observation that even though gqm does not have an @xmath5 in its formulation , its ` classical ' limit can still be defined by taking the limit @xmath15 . in that limit",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we review how gqm is constructed on @xmath10 .",
    "we will look at what happens to the theory if we let @xmath0 for the case @xmath19 , and discuss its ` classical ' properties . in section  3",
    "we review the notion of @xmath2 , the ` field with one element , ' following the treatment of kurokawa and koyama,@xcite and show that the @xmath0 limit of gqm can be constructed directly on the ` vector ' space @xmath20 .",
    "the resulting state space is a projective geometry , just as with gqm and canonical qm .",
    "the theory on @xmath20 also prohibits the superposition of states , precisely the property one expects in a ` classical ' theory .",
    "discussion on what this teaches us is given in section  4 .",
    "since the details of gqm can be found in refs .   and , here we only present the basic outline .",
    "consider the vector space @xmath10 .",
    "vectors in @xmath10 represent states of the model system , while dual vectors in the dual vector space @xmath21 represent possible outcomes of measurements .",
    "the probability of obtaining the outcome represented by the dual - vector @xmath22 when a measurement is performed on the state represented by the vector @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 where the sum in the denominator runs over all the dual vectors @xmath25 in a basis of @xmath21 which includes @xmath26 .",
    "the choice of basis of @xmath21 corresponds to an observable , each dual vector in the basis representing a different outcome .",
    "the absolute value function in the above expression converts elements of @xmath16 into either zero or one in @xmath27 : @xmath28 here , underlined numbers and symbols represent elements of @xmath16 , to distinguish them from elements of @xmath27 or @xmath29 .",
    "since @xmath30 is a cyclic multiplicative group , this assignment of ` absolute values ' is the only one consistent with the requirement that the map from @xmath16 to non - negative @xmath27 be product preserving , that is : @xmath31 .",
    "since the same absolute value is assigned to all non - zero brackets , all outcomes @xmath26 for which the bracket with the state @xmath32 is non - zero are given equal probabilistic weight .",
    "note also that the multiplication of @xmath32 with a non - zero element of @xmath16 will not affect the probability .",
    "thus , vectors that differ by non - zero multiplicative constants are identified as representing the same physical state , and the state space is endowed with the finite projective geometry @xcite @xmath33 where each ` line ' going through the origin of @xmath10 is identified as a ` point , ' in close analogy to the complex projective geometry @xmath34 of canonical @xmath9-level qm defined on @xmath35 .      to give a concrete example of our proposal ,",

    "thus , a more sophisticated definition of @xmath2 is called for .",
    "various definitions of @xmath2 and @xmath2-geometries exist in the literature , which endeavor to make sense of these concepts , a survey of which can be found in ref .   by lorscheid and lopez - pena . here",

    "since addition is not allowed , ` vector ' spaces over @xmath147 are not truly ` vector ' spaces in the usual sense of the term .",
    "however , lacking a better alternative , let us use vector space terminology anyway .",
    "since @xmath147 is an @xmath9-dimensional space , it will have @xmath9 basis vectors , which we denote @xmath148 the linear combinations of these basis vectors are of the form @xmath149 but since we should have no addition , only one of the @xmath150 s is allowed to be non - zero at a time .",

    "linear transformations on @xmath20 must not lead to addition of the basis vectors .",
    "so the only allowed transformations are those for which the @xmath151 matrix representation has at most one @xmath49 in each row .",
    "the non - singular ones , i.e. the automorphisms , are the ones in which there is one @xmath49 in each row and each column .",
    "these are simply the matrices that permute the @xmath9 basis vectors .",
    "since @xmath152 , the projective space @xmath122 will simply consist of the non - zero vectors in @xmath147 .",
    "there are @xmath9 of these , as required for @xmath122 .",
    "the projective linear group @xmath153 would be @xmath114 .",
    "linear maps from @xmath20 to @xmath2 , i.e. the dual vectors , must also satisfy the no - addition requirement , so they would be @xmath154 row - vectors , each with only one @xmath49 , the remaining elements all @xmath50 .",
    "these are precisely the dual vectors representing outcomes in the @xmath0 limit of gqm .",
    "thus , the kurokawa - koyama approach matches well with the gqm construction , and the @xmath0 ` classical ' limit can be constructed directly on @xmath20 defined in this fashion .",
    "the resulting state space has the projective geometry @xmath122 .",
    "note , particularly , that the prohibition of addition in kurokawa - koyama leads to the lack of superposition of states in the ` classical ' limit of gqm .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 limit of gqm can be considered to be ` classical ' due to this very special feature of @xmath2 .",
    "illuminating the precise relation between cm and qm remains one of the outstanding problems in the foundations of physics . in this note",
    "we point out that a simple discrete toy model sheds new light on this important problem .    in order to compare the two seemingly disparate formalisms of physics ,",
    "first , one needs a unifying mathematical language for such a comparison .",
    "this idea , that classical theory should be rewritten using the mathematics of qm goes back at least to koopman@xcite and von neumann.@xcite in our proposal this unifying mathematical language is provided by the projective spaces of gqm.@xcite    we have demonstrated that gqm defined on @xmath10 becomes ` classical ' in the limit @xmath0 .",
    "the field with one element @xmath2 , over which this limit can be constructed , have all the ` classical ' properties of consisting only of zero and one , and addition being prohibited .",
    "in other words , the ` classical'-ness of @xmath0 gqm can be traced to the ` classical'-ness of @xmath2 . this way of achieving ` classicality ' from `",
    "quantum'-ness is quite different from the usual methodology of taking @xmath3 , in the limit of which operators become commuting . in gqm",
    ", there is no @xmath5 and there are no operators .",
    "our result suggests that the pathway from a ` quantum ' theory to a ` classical ' one may not be unique . looking at canonical qm , taking the @xmath3 limit ( in some yet unknown pathway ) may not be the only way for the theory to become classical . perhaps replacing @xmath29 with some other mathematical structure , perhaps a continuous analog of @xmath2 ,",
    "though there is no telling such an entity exists , could lead to a theory which is ` classical ' in some new way .",
    "the basic premise of this paper is that the relation between cm and qm lies in the differences in the structure and geometry of the underlying number fields upon which the descriptions are predicated . while we have not discussed the limit @xmath155 within the context of the biorthogonal quantum mechanics we defined in ref .",
    ", the premise is quite apparent there as well .",
    "the approach there was an alternative method of constructing a quantum - like theory on @xmath10 .",
    "the chsh bound on ` spin ' systems defined on @xmath156 in this approach is @xmath92-dependent .",
    "we were able to demonstrate that this bound takes on the classical value of 2 for @xmath157 , and the super - quantum value of 4 for @xmath158 .",
    "once again , it is the differences in the structure of the underlying number fields @xmath159 and @xmath160 $ ] , the latter of which accommodates the analog of the imaginary unit @xmath161 , and their associated geometries , that presage classical , quantum , and super - quantum correlations .",
    "qm is our current fundamental framework of physics . as such it has passed all available observational tests . and",
    "yet our understanding of qm remains limited .",
    "in particular , one would still like to understand if qm follows from few elementary axioms , in analogy what happens in the special theory of relativity .",
    "also , one would like to understand in more detail the precise relation between qm and its classical limit , the problem addressed in this paper .",
    "finally , could qm be part of a larger framework , the way cm appears as a formal limit of qm ( or in another context , similar to the way the special theory of relativity can be naturally generalized to the general theory of relativity ) ?",
    "it is very difficult to answer all three questions within the framework of canonical qm of the real world as we understand it today , so a simpler model was called for .",
    "this was the main motivation of our effort to build a toy model of qm using galois fields .",
    "surprisingly , all three questions can be addressed in this context . in our previous publications on this subject@xcite",
    "we have constructed the precise mathematical rules of the game in this toy world , and we have shed light on the nature of quantum correlations , on the nature of super - quantum correlations@xcite ( which generalize the usual quantum framework ) as well as on the difference between classical and quantum correlations . in this paper , we complete this picture by addressing the subtle question of the ` classical ' limit in the context of gqm . understandably enough",
    ", our toy world is not the real world .",
    "however , for the first time , the two known theories of the real world ( the classical and quantum theory ) as well as the conjectured third theory ( based on stronger than quantum , or superquantum , correlations ) can be addressed in one coherent theoretical framework , that is simple yet illuminating . and",
    "this is where we find the most useful lessons of our work .",
    "we would like to thank chia hsiung tze and cosmas zachos for helpful discussions .",
