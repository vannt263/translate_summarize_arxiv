    "the gamma model of parallel programming was introduced by jean - pierre bentre and daniel le mtayer in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for a more accessible account of the model and  @xcite for a recent account of it ; also see  @xcite for a thorough presentation of the field of multiset processing ) . at the time of its introduction ,",
    "parallel programming as a mental activity was considered more difficult ( one might also say cumbersome ) than sequential programming , something that even today it is still valid to a certain degree .",
    "bentre and le mtayer designed gamma in order to ease the design and specification of parallel algorithms .",
    "thus , making a parallel programming task easier compared to previously available approaches .",
    "gamma was inspired by the chemical reaction model . according to this metaphor",
    ", the state of a system is like a chemical solution in which _ molecules _ , that is , processes , can interact with each other according to _ reaction rules _ , while all possible contacts are possible since a magic hand stirs the solution continuously . in gamma solutions",
    "are represented by",
    "_ multisets _",
    "( i.e. , an extension of sets that is based on the assumption that elements may occur more than one time , see  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "processes are elements of a multiset and the reaction rules are multiset rewriting rules .",
    "thus , gamma is a formalism for multiset processing .",
    "the chemical abstract machine ( or cham for short ) is a model of concurrent computation developed by grard berry and grard boudol  @xcite .",
    "the cham is based on the gamma model and was designed as a tool for the description of concurrent systems . basically , each cham is a chemical solution in which floating molecules can interact with each other according to a set of reaction rules .",
    "in addition , a magical mechanism stirs the solution so as to allow possible contacts between molecules .",
    "as is evident , a number of interactions happen concurrently .",
    "informally , a process is a program in execution , which is completely characterized by the value of the _ program counter _ ,",
    "the contents of the processor s registers and the process _ stack _ ( see  @xcite for an overview ) . naturally , two or more processes may be initiated from the same program ( e.g. , think of a web browser like firefox ) . in general ,",
    "such processes are considered as distinct execution sequences .",
    "although , they have the same text section , the data sections will vary .",
    "interestingly , one can view the totality of processes that run in a system at any moment as a multiset that evolves over time , which is built _ on - the - fly _ and may be viewed as the recorded history of a system .",
    "however , there is a problem that is not covered by this scheme and which i plan to tackle here : the processes are not identical , but _",
    "similar _ and so i need a more expressive mathematical formalism to describe running processes .",
    "fuzzy set theory was introduced by lotfi asker zadef in 1965 ( see  @xcite for a thorough presentation of the theory of fuzzy sets ) .",
    "fuzzy set theory is based on the denial of the idea that an element either belongs or does not belong to some set .",
    "instead , it has introduced the notion of a _ membership degree _",
    "@xmath1 according to which an element belongs to a fuzzy subset of an ordinary or _",
    "crisp _ set .",
    "usually , this degree is a real number between zero and one ( i.e. , @xmath2 ) .",
    "for example , i may say that the degree to which @xmath3 belongs to the fuzzy subset @xmath4 is @xmath5 . according to fuzzy set theory",
    ", when an element belongs to a fuzzy subset with membership degree equal to zero , this does not imply that the element does not belong to a set . on the contrary , it simply means that the element belongs to the fuzzy subset with degree that is equal to zero .",
    "formally , given a universe @xmath6 a fuzzy subset @xmath4 is characterized by a function @xmath7 $ ] , where @xmath8 means that the membership degree of @xmath3 is @xmath1 .",
    "[ [ plan - of - the - paper ] ] plan of the paper + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    i start by giving a `` formal '' definition of chams .",
    "next , i argue why processes should be viewed as fuzzy entities and then i present a model of fuzzy processes that culminates to a brief introduction of fuzzy @xmath6-machines .",
    "the fuzzy chemical abstract machine is introduced next and this discussion is followed by an exercise in defining a fuzzy version of the @xmath0-calculus from the description of a fuzzified chemical abstract machine that originally described the @xmath0-calculus .",
    "the ingredients of a cham are _ molecules _ @xmath9 that flow in _ solutions",
    "_ @xmath10 .",
    "solutions change according to a number of _ transformation rules _ , which determine a _ transformation relation _ @xmath11 .",
    "a cham is fully specified by defining its molecules , its solutions , and its transformation rules .",
    "there are two types of transformation rules : general rules , applicable to any cham , and local rules , which are used to specify particular chams .",
    "molecules are terms of algebras associated with specific operations for each cham .",
    "solutions are multisets of molecules @xmath12 $ ] . by applying the _ airlock _ constructor``@xmath13 '' to some molecule @xmath14 and a solution @xmath15 , one gets the new molecule @xmath16 .",
    "a specific rule has the following form @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are molecules . also , there are four general transformation rules :    1 .   the _ reaction _ rule where an instance of the right - hand side of a rule replace the corresponding instance of its left - hand side . in particular , if there is a rule @xmath20 and if the @xmath21s and @xmath22s are instances of the @xmath18s and the @xmath23s by a common substitution , then @xmath24\\rightarrow[m_{1}^{\\prime } , m_{2}^{\\prime},\\ldots , m_{l}^{\\prime}].\\ ] ] 2 .",
    "the _ chemical _ rule specifies that reactions can be performed freely within any solution : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the multiset sum operator .",
    "3 .   according to the _ membrane _ rule sub - solutions can freely evolve in any context : @xmath27\\rightarrow[c(s')]},\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is molecule with a hole @xmath29 in which another molecule is placed .",
    "note that solutions are treated as megamolecules .",
    "the _ airlock _ rule has the following form : @xmath30\\uplus s\\leftrightarrow [ m \\lhd s].\\ ] ]",
    "at any moment any operating system is executing a number of different processes . quite naturally , many different processes are instances of the same program . for example , in a multi - user environment , different users may run different instances of the same web browser .",
    "cases like this can be naturally modeled by _",
    "multisets _ , which from a generalization of sets .",
    "any multiset may include more than one copy of an element .",
    "typically , a multiset @xmath31 is characterized by a function @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the set of natural numbers including zero and @xmath34 means that multiset @xmath31 contains @xmath35 copies of @xmath3 .",
    "one may say that the elements of a multiset are tokens of different types .",
    "thus , a multiset consisting of two copies of `` a '' and three copies of `` b '' can be viewed as a structure that consists of two tokens of type `` a '' and three tokens of type `` b '' ( see  @xcite for a thorough discussion of this idea ) .",
    "when dealing with an operating system , one may argue that types represent the various programs available to users and tokens represent the various processes corresponding to these programs .",
    "although it does make sense to view programs as types and processes as tokens , still not all tokens are identical .",
    "for example , different people that use a particular web browser view different web pages and have different numbers of tabs open at any given moment .",
    "thus , we can not actually talk about processes that are identical , but we can surely talk about processes that are similar .",
    "the next question that needs to be answered is : how can we compare processes ?",
    "an easy solution is to define _ archetypal _ processes and then to compare each process with its corresponding archetypal process .",
    "the outcome of this procedure will be the estimation of a similarity degree .",
    "but what exactly is an archetypal process ?",
    "clearly , there is no single answer to this question , but roughly one could define it as follows :    assume that @xmath36 is an executable program for some computational platform ( operating system , cpu , etc . ) , then an archetypal process @xmath0 of @xmath36 is the program @xmath36 running with minimum resources .    here the term _ minimum resources",
    "_ means that the archetypal process consumes the least possible resources ( e.g. , memory , cpu time , etc . ) .",
    "let @xmath37 be some web browser , then an archetypal process of @xmath37 is the web browser which when starts shows a blank page in only one tab / window .",
    "similarly , an archetypal process for the unix ` ls ` command is the command running without arguments in an empty directory .",
    "assume that @xmath38 and @xmath39 are two processes initiated from the same binary @xmath36 .",
    "assume also that @xmath0 is an archetypal process and that @xmath40 is a method that measures the similarity degree of some process @xmath41 to @xmath0 .",
    "in different words , @xmath42 means that @xmath36 is similar with @xmath0 to a degree equal to @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath43 denotes degree to which the two processes @xmath44 and @xmath45 are similar , then @xmath46    suppose that one has selected a number of criteria to choose and specify archetypal processes .",
    "let @xmath47 denote the set of all possible archetypal processes for a particular system @xmath48 and a particular set of criteria .",
    "without loss of generality , we can think that the elements of @xmath47 are the names of all programs that can possibly be executed on a system @xmath48 .",
    "for instance , for some typical unix system @xmath49 , the set @xmath50 may contain the names of programs under /usr / bin , /usr / local / bin , /opt / sfw / bin , etc .",
    "suppose that @xmath51 and that at some moment @xmath52 , @xmath53 are processes initiated from program @xmath0 .",
    "then this situation can naturally be modelled by fuzzy multisets , that is , multisets whose elements belong to the set to some degree .",
    "a fuzzy multiset is characterized by a higher - order function @xmath54\\rightarrow\\mathbb{n})$ ] .",
    "fuzzy multisets were introduced by ronald r.  yager  @xcite . by uncurrying the functional @xmath55",
    ", we get a function @xmath56\\rightarrow\\mathbb{n}$ ] . thus , in general , at any given moment the processes running in a system can be described by a multiset of pairs @xmath57 , where @xmath58 denotes the membership degree . however , such a structure reflects what is happening in a system a given moment .",
    "thus , to describe what is going on in a system at some time interval we need a structure that can reflect changes as time passes .",
    "the most natural choice that can solve this problem is a form of a _ set through time_.    bill lawvere was the first to suggest that sheaves can be viewed as continuously varying sets ( see  @xcite and  @xcite for a detailed account of this idea ) . since in this particular case",
    "i am interested in _ fuzzy multisets continuously varying through time _",
    ", it seems that sheaves are not the structures i am looking for .",
    "however , as i will show this is not true .",
    "but before i proceed , it is more than necessary to give the general definition of a sheaf .",
    "the definition that follows has been borrowed from  @xcite ( readers not familiar with basic topological notions should consult any introductory textbook , e.g. , see",
    "@xcite ) :    let @xmath6 be a topological space and @xmath59 its collection of open sets . a sheaf over @xmath6 is a pair @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a topological space and @xmath62 is a local homeomorphism ( i.e. , each @xmath63 has an open neighborhood @xmath64 in @xmath61 that is mapped homeomorphically by @xmath36 onto @xmath65 , and the later is open in @xmath6 ) .",
    "let us now construct a fuzzy multiset through time .",
    "suppose that @xmath7\\rightarrow\\mathbb{n}$ ] characterizes some fuzzy multiset .",
    "clearly , the function @xmath66\\rightarrow\\mathbb{n}$ ] also characterizes the same fuzzy multiset . and if this function characterizes some fuzzy multiset , then it is absolutely reasonable to say that the graph of this function characterizes the same fuzzy multiset .",
    "let @xmath67 , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is a set of indices , be the graphs of all functions @xmath70 that characterize fuzzy multisets .",
    "in addition , assume that each @xmath67 is an open set of a topological space @xmath71 .",
    "obviously , it is not difficult to define such a topological space .",
    "for example , it is possible to define a metric between points @xmath72 and @xmath73 and from this to define a metric topology .",
    "having defined a topology on @xmath74)\\times\\mathbb{n}$ ] , it is straightforward to define a sheaf over @xmath71 . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath33 denotes the order topology on the set of natural numbers , then @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is a local homeomorphism , is a sheaf over @xmath71 . in general",
    ", such a sheaf characterizes a fuzzy multiset through _ discrete _ time . clearly , this is not the only sheaf over @xmath71 one can define .",
    "in fact , one can build a category @xmath77 with objects all sheaves over @xmath71 and with arrows @xmath78 the continuous maps @xmath79 such that @xmath80{b}\\arrow[8]{se , l}{q}\\\\[10 ] \\node{a}\\arrow[7]{ne , l}{k}\\arrow[15]{e , b}{p}\\node[18]{\\mathscr{x } } \\end{diagram}\\ ] ] commutes .",
    "in general , the sheaf @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the set of the positive real numbers including zero and here denotes also the order topology on this set and @xmath83 is a local homeomorphism , characterizes a fuzzy multiset through _ continuous _ time .",
    "it is not difficult to define a monic arrow @xmath84 and , thus , to show that @xmath85 belongs to @xmath86 , that is , the collection of sub - objects of @xmath87 .",
    "thus , we have an implicit proof of the following statement :    sheaf @xmath87 contains more information than @xmath88 .    to put it differently ,",
    "no discrete system can fully simulate a continuous system .",
    "it should be obvious , that in the most general case one can not know beforehand all the components of a sheaf representing a fuzzy multiset through time .",
    "when such a structure is used to represent processes , then it is _ noncomputable _ , since one can not construct it using some algorithm as it is not possible to foresee what the users will do .",
    "a model of computation is a precise description of a conceptual , real , or abstract computational device , which can be used to implement certain computational tasks .",
    "consequently , there are tasks that are implementable and tasks that are not feasible . by broadening the notion of computation ( e.g. , by augmenting the computational machinery with external agents ) , it is possible to extend a model of computation .",
    "for example , if one assumes that things happen randomly , then it makes sense to introduce some form of randomness in our computation ( e.g. , think of nondeterministic turing machines ) .",
    "thus , it was more than expected to see the emergence of extended variants of the cham . indeed , a. di pierro , c. hankin , and h. wiklicky introduced in  @xcite a probabilistic version of cham .",
    "in this model , multisets and mutliset rewriting rules are associated with probabilities so as to allow a nondeterministic computation . in general ,",
    "nondeterministic conceptual computing devices are not more powerful than their deterministic counterparts .",
    "thus , from the point of view of computability theory such models are not that interesting . on the other hand",
    ", fuzziness seems to be a more promising and interesting direction ( e.g. , see  @xcite ) and so models of computation incorporating fuzziness are more interesting and , at the same time , seem to be closer to what happens in reality .",
    "a cham is defined by specifying the molecule syntax and a set of molecule reaction rules .",
    "the molecule syntax describes some algebra and the transformation rules are actually multiset rewriting rules that model transitions in a system .",
    "thus , in order to define a fuzzy cham , or just fucham for simplicity , it is necessary to review known notions from fuzzy algebraic theory and to introduce some notion related to fuzzy labeled transition systems .",
    "[ [ fuzzy - algebras ] ] fuzzy algebras + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    back in 1971 , fuzzy groups were introduced by azriel rosenfled  @xcite as a natural extension of groups :    assume that @xmath89 is a group and that @xmath7 $ ] is a fuzzy subset of @xmath6 , then @xmath4 is a fuzzy subgroup of @xmath6 if @xmath90    by replacing @xmath91 with some other fuzzy @xmath52-norm , one gets a more general structure called a @xmath52-fuzzy group .",
    "also , by following this line of thought it is possible to define more complex fuzzy algebraic structures ( e.g. , fuzzy rings , etc . ) .",
    "but , this is not the only way to fuzzify a group .",
    "indeed , m.  demirci and j.  recasens proposed in  @xcite a fuzzy subgroup to be a group @xmath92 , where @xmath93 denotes the degree to which @xmath94 .",
    "an even more fuzzier algebraic structure is one were both the elements belongs to the underlying set to a degree and the result of the operation is the `` real '' result up to some degree .",
    "assume that @xmath92 is a group and that @xmath7 $ ] is a fuzzy subset of @xmath6 , then @xmath4 is a fuzzy subgroup of @xmath6 if @xmath95    of course when one talks about processes , it does not make sense to speak about real algebraic operations .",
    "for example , although the notion of the inverse of some program @xmath96 has been discussed thoroughly in  @xcite , there is no general technique to get the inverse of some program .",
    "fortunately , one can talk about monoidal operations since we can find some identity process .",
    "given two processes @xmath36 and @xmath97 , the expressions @xmath98 and @xmath99 denote a nondeterministic choice between @xmath36 and @xmath97 and the ( parallel ) composition of @xmath36 and @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "in particular , @xmath98 behaves either like @xmath36 or like @xmath97 . in many case , the environment favors one particular alternative , while in others it may favor the other alternative . and",
    "it is this remark that justifies the introduction of fuzzy set theory to model cases like this one .",
    "the expression @xmath99 can be viewed as a system in which @xmath36 and @xmath97 may proceed independently but may also interact in some prescribed way .",
    "as time passes by , the system may evolve but its evolution will depend on the degree @xmath36 and/or @xmath97 can evolve to @xmath100 and/or @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "of course , we can introduce fuzziness by specifying to what degree two processes may proceed independently .

    "interestingly , there are exceptions to this view that are widely used even today .",
    "for example , an operating system does not cease to operate and those who stop unexpectedly are considered failures .",

    "on the other hand if states are elements of some fuzzy subset , then we can say that there is a termination degree associated with each computation .",
    "in other words , a computation may not completely stop or it may stop at some unexpected moment .",

    "let us informally examine whether it makes sense to talk about solutions with fuzzy molecules and about fuzzy reaction rules . to begin with consider the following concrete chemical reaction rule : @xmath187 according to the `` traditional '' view , two hydrogen molecules react with one oxygen molecule to create two water molecules .",
    "a fuzzy version of this reaction rule should involve fuzzy molecules and it should be associated with a plausibility degree .",
    "this is justified by the _",
    "fact _ that molecules of some chemical element or compound are not identical but rather similar to a degree with an ideal molecule of this particular element or compound .",
    "in other words , not all hydrogen and oxygen molecules that react to create water are identical .",
    "for example , think of deuterium and tritium as `` hydrogen '' molecules up to some degree that react with oxygen to produce heavy water , tritiated water and/or partially tritiated water , that is , water up to some degree .",
    "thus , the `` water '' molecules produced when millions of `` hydrogen '' molecules react with oxygen molecules are not identical but just similar ( if , in addition , the reader considers hydrogen peroxide , that is , @xmath188 , then things will get really _ fuzzy _ ) . obviously , the higher the similarity degree , the more likely it is that the reaction will take place . and",
    "this is the reason one must associate with each reaction rule a plausibility degree .",
    "although these ideas may seem unnatural , still g.f .",
    "cerofolini and p.  amato  @xcite have used fuzziness and linear logic to propose an axiomatic theory for general chemistry . in particular , they have developed ideas similar to ours in order to explain how chemical reaction take place , which means that my proposal , which i call the _ fuzzy chemical metaphor _ , is not unnatural at all .",
    "the fuzzy chemical metaphor is essentially identical to the chemical metaphor , nevertheless , it assumes that molecules of the same kind are similar and not identical .",
    "solutions of fuzzy molecules may react according to a number of fuzzy reaction rules , whereas each rule is associated with a feasibility degree that specifies how plausible it is that a particular reaction will take place .",

    "as it stands the only way to introduce fuzziness in the @xmath0-calculus is to assume that action prefixes are fuzzy .",
