    "one of the major challenges to cosmology for the foreseeable future is to understand `` dark energy '' , the mysterious component responsible for the apparent accelerating expansion of our universe @xcite .",
    "dark energy can be parameterized by its contribution to the universe s energy density , @xmath2 , and its equation - of - state ratio , @xmath3 .",
    "of particular interest will be measurements that probe @xmath3 , testing whether the dark energy is a true cosmological constant [ @xmath4 or whether it arises , for example , from an evolving field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of our best observational probes of the dark energy is the distance - redshift relation , which maps the expansion history of the universe .",
    "much of our knowledge of this relation comes from observations of distant type ia supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "these sne serve as standard candles : their observed intensity can be calibrated to tell us their luminosity distance , @xmath5 @xcite . as the redshift of a sn ( or its host ) can also be measured , each sn puts a point on the distance - redshift curve .",
    "future surveys ( e.g. , _ supernova / acceleration probe _ , _ large - aperture synoptic survey telescope _ ) are expected to measure thousands of type ia sne , mapping the distance - redshift curve over a large span of redshift with good statistical significance .",
    "type ia sne are excellent standard candles , with a ( calibrated ) peak brightness thought to be known to about @xmath6 . a possible objection to sne as standard candles",
    "is the absence of a solid theoretical underpinning .",
    "of particular concern is the possibility of evolution in sn brightnesses , leading to unknown systematic errors @xcite . in this article",
    ", we discuss a completely independent standard candle : the gravitational - wave ( gw ) driven inspiral of massive binary black holes ( bbhs ) .",
    "as gw detections can be thought of as aural rather than optical  @xcite , a more appropriate term for a gw standard candle is a `` standard siren . ''",
    "because bbh systems are relatively simple and well modeled ( at least in the early `` inspiral '' phase of their coalescence ) , the gws they generate determine the source s luminosity distance with high accuracy : typically @xmath7@xmath1 , with most of the uncertainty arising from correlations with pointing errors @xcite .",
    "bbh merger events will follow the mergers of galaxies and pregalactic structures at high redshift @xcite . though the merger rate is poorly understood , _",
    "lisa _ is expected to measure at least several events over its mission , especially as it is sensitive to these waves to enormous distances @xcite .    since gws",
    "do not provide the redshift of the source , bbh gw measurements alone do not probe the distance - redshift relation .",
    "however , as first noted by bernard schutz , should some kind of `` electromagnetic '' ( em ) counterpart to a bbh gw event be identified , the situation changes drastically @xcite .",
    "first , by determining the source position , many correlations which set the distance error are broken .",
    "the error then drops immensely  below @xmath8@xmath9 in many cases .",
    "second , a counterpart could determine the source s redshift .",
    "a bbh gw source coupled with an em counterpart could therefore constitute an exceedingly good standard siren .",
    "we comment at this point that , to date , there has not been a great deal of careful analysis regarding the nature of em counterparts which may accompany a gw event .",
    "we discuss briefly some ideas that have been presented to date regarding the form that counterparts may take in ",
    "[ sec : counterpart ] and  [ sec : counterpart2 ] .",
    "we hope that the promise of this high quality candle will motivate additional thinking on this issue .    in practice ,",
    "gravitational lensing will limit the quality of this candle .",
    "gws are lensed by intervening matter exactly as electromagnetic waves are lensed @xcite .",
    "as the waves propagate through our inhomogeneous universe , they are magnified ( or demagnified ) , inducing some error in our inferred luminosity distance to the source . as we discuss in  [ sec : lensing ] , the distribution of errors is such that a bbh candle will most likely be comparable in quality to a type ia sn standard candle .",
    "however  and we strongly emphasize this point  the bbh candle will have entirely different systematics from sne .",
    "concordance between the two types of measurement could thus alleviate concerns about evolutionary effects in type ia sne , and greatly increase one s confidence in all standard candles .",
    "massive bbh coalescences are among the most luminous events in the universe . that luminosity ( peaked at @xmath10 )",
    "is radiated in gws , which couple very weakly to matter . the planned space - based gw detector _",
    "( the _ laser interferometer space antenna _ ) will be sensitive to these bbh waves in the frequency band @xmath11@xmath12 , making possible measurements from binaries with total masses @xmath13@xmath14 @xcite out to redshifts of at least @xmath15@xmath16 and possibly beyond @xcite . in this section we discuss how _ lisa _ measurements determine the distance to a source , summarizing our model of the waveform and _ lisa _ s sensitivity and response , and discussing the measurement precision we expect from measuring merging black hole populations .      for this paper ,",
    "the most interesting epoch of bbh coalescence is the _ inspiral _ , when the binary s members are widely separated and slowly spiral together due to backreaction from gw emission .",
    "the gws from this epoch are well modeled using the post - newtonian approximation , roughly speaking an expansion in inverse separation of a binary s members ; see @xcite and references therein for more detailed discussion .",
    "we will not discuss waves from the _ merger _ ( in which the holes come into contact , forming a single body ) , nor from the _ ringdown _ ( the final , simple stage of the ringdown , in which the merged binary is well - modeled as a single , distorted black hole ) , as they do not substantially impact distance determination .",
    "inspiral gws encode the luminosity distance to a binary , its position on the sky , its orientation , and information about certain combinations of masses and spins ; see @xcite and @xcite for up - to - date discussion and details .",
    "the inspiral does _ not _ encode a source s cosmological redshift .",
    "redshift is instead entangled with the binary s evolution .",
    "for example , the masses @xmath17 impact orbital evolution as timescales @xmath18 .",
    "these timescales redshift , so the measured masses redshift : a binary with masses @xmath17 at redshift @xmath19 is indistinguishible from a local binary with masses @xmath20 $ ] ( modulo amplitude ) .",
    "this reflects the fact that general relativity has no absolute scale .    in a reference frame centered on the solar system s barycenter ,",
    "the strongest harmonic of the inspiral gw s two polarizations has the form @xmath21^{2/3}\\over d_l}\\left[1 + ( \\hat l\\cdot\\hat n)^2\\right ] \\cos[\\phi(t)]\\ ; , \\\\ h_\\times & = & { 4{\\cal m}_z^{5/3}[\\pi f(t)]^{2/3}(\\hat l\\cdot\\hat n)\\over d_l } \\sin[\\phi(t)]\\;. \\label{eq : wave_bary}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the mass parameter @xmath22 is the binary s redshifted `` chirp mass '' , so called because it largely sets the rate at which the binary s members spiral towards one another , determining the `` chirp '' of the orbital frequency .",
    "the phase @xmath23 depends on intrinsic binary parameters  the masses and spins of its members ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it depends particularly strongly on @xmath24 ; as a consequence , phase coherent measurements of the waves will determine the chirp mass with great precision @xcite .",
    "the wave frequency @xmath25 .",
    "the unit vector @xmath26 points from the center of the barycenter frame to the system , and hence defines its position on the sky ; @xmath27 points along the binary s orbital angular momentum , and hence defines its orientation .",
    "notice that the luminosity distance @xmath5 appears in combination with these two angular factors .",
    "determining @xmath5 thus requires fixing these angles . as we now discuss , _ lisa _ is able to do so by virtue of its orbital motion .",
    "the _ lisa _ antenna consists of three spacecraft , arranged in orbits about the sun such that they form an equilateral triangle ( roughly ; the armlengths are in general not equal , and in fact oscillate  albeit with periods much longer than that of the gws we aim to observe ) .",
    "this triangle `` rolls '' as the spacecraft move through their individual orbits , preserving the triangular formation .",
    "the centroid of the constellation shares earth s orbit , lagging by @xmath28 , so that it takes 1 year to orbit the sun .",
    "figure [ fig : lisa_orb ] shows a schematic of the orbital configuration .",
    "see @xcite for detailed discussion of the _ lisa _ mission and its orbital configuration .",
    "at least in the low frequency limit ( @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is armlength ) , _ lisa _ can very usefully be regarded as two gw detectors : the time varying armlength data , @xmath31 can be used to synthesize outputs for two equivalent `` l''-shaped detectors , with @xmath32 arms .",
    "these `` equivalent detectors '' are rotated by @xmath33 with respect to one another ; see @xcite for details and derivation of this viewpoint .",
    "the datastream @xmath34 of the these two equivalent detectors is given by a weighted sum of the two gw polarizations , plus noise : @xmath35 + n_{\\rm i , ii}(t)\\;. \\label{eq : datastream}\\ ] ] the prefactor @xmath36 in this expression enters when converting the `` real '' interferometer response to that of the synthesized equivalent detectors .",
    "the antenna functions @xmath37 depend on the orientation and position of the source relative to the antenna . because of the antenna s orbital motion , the position and orientation of the source relative to the antenna is continually changing .",
    "the motion of the detector thus modulates the measured signal ; the exact nature of the modulation depends upon the position and orientation of the source .",
    "we write the response functions as time dependent functions to reflect this modulation .",
    "note also that the waveform phasing is modified in an important manner by the antenna s motion  the orbital motion causes frequency as well as amplitude modulation .",
    "see @xcite for further discussion .",
    "we take the noises in the equivalent detectors , @xmath38 , to be uncorrelated , gaussian random processes , with the same rms values : @xmath39 in all of our analysis , we use the same noise model as that used by @xcite [ their eqs .",
    "( 48)(54 ) ] . in our calculations",
    ", it is necessary to introduce a low frequency cutoff  a frequency at which the sensitivity to gws rapidly degrades .",
    "this cutoff has important implications for determining which binaries _ lisa _ can measure : the frequency support of a binary s gw spectrum is inversely proportional to its mass . in other words ,",
    "more massive binaries will radiate at lower frequencies than less massive binaries .",
    "the low frequency cutoff thus determines the _ maximum _ binary black hole mass accessible to _ lisa _ measurements .",
    "it also determines the amount of time for which a binary s waves are in band : a binary that may only be in band for a few days when @xmath40 may be in band for many months when @xmath41 .",
    "unless stated otherwise , we have set @xmath42 for the results we present here .",
    "this is a somewhat conservative choice ; some members of the _ lisa _ mission design community ( particularly p.  bender ) argue that _ lisa _ should have good sensitivity down to frequencies @xmath43 . accordingly ,",
    "we have put @xmath44 in several of our calculations .",
    "we flag such cases when appropriate .    to understand more clearly how _",
    "lisa _ extracts the luminosity distance from measurements of a binary black hole inspiral , it is useful to rewrite somewhat schematically the measured form of the inspiral as follows : @xmath45\\;. \\label{eq : wave_schem}\\ ] ] we have subsumed the angle - dependent factors @xmath46 and @xmath37 into the schematic functions @xmath47 ; we leave the dependence upon @xmath48 in these functions as a reminder that the constellation s motion modulates the waveform .",
    "we have likewise written the phase modulations imposed by the detector s response and motion in the schematic form @xmath49 .    from the form of equation  ( [ eq : wave_schem ] )",
    "we see that the luminosity distance is very strongly correlated with the redshifted chirp mass , @xmath24 , and the various angles which set the instantaneous waveform amplitude .",
    "as already mentioned , @xmath24 is typically determined with extremely high precision because it fixes the phase evolution : typically , @xmath50 .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite for examples specific to _",
    "lisa_.    the modulations induced by _",
    "s orbital motion make it possible to measure sky position for events which last for at least a fair fraction of _ lisa _ s orbit .",
    "we estimate the accuracy with which position ( among other parameters ) is determined using a maximum likelihood parameter estimation formalism @xcite : from the detector s response to a given gravitational wave , we construct the variance - covariance matrix @xmath51 .",
    "diagonal elements of this matrix represent the rms error @xmath52 in a source parameter @xmath53 ; off - diagonal components describe the degree to which errors in parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 are correlated .",
    "see @xcite for discussion specifically tailored to this application .      to assess distance and position accuracy ,",
    "we have estimated the accuracy with which these parameters are measured for a wide range of binary masses .",
    "for each set of masses , we randomly distribute the sky position and orientation of 10,000 such binaries .",
    "we then calculate the fractional accuracy with which distance is determined for each binary , @xmath55 , as well as the angular sky position error @xmath56 .",
    "figure [ fig : z=1_m1=1e5_m2=6e5 ] shows the distribution we find in these quantities for binaries with @xmath57 , @xmath58 at @xmath59 .",
    "we find that the typical position determination is relatively poor  these binaries are fixed to an error box that , at best , is @xmath60 arcminutes on a side . in most cases ,",
    "the resolution is substantially worse .",
    "the distance determination , by contrast , is quite good : half of these events have their distance determined with precision @xmath61 .",
    "table 1 summarizes the parameter determination distributions we find for a wide range of masses . for @xmath55 and @xmath56 ,",
    "we give the 5% , 25% , 50% , and 90% likelihood values from the distributions predicted by our monte - carlo calculation .",
    "for example , for binaries with @xmath62 , @xmath63 at @xmath59 , 25% of all events have @xmath64 and localize the source to @xmath65 arcminutes ; 90% of all events with these masses and redshifts have @xmath66 and localize the source to @xmath67 arcminutes .    notice that , in this table , the best pointing and distance determination occurs for binaries that have a total ( redshifted ) mass @xmath68",
    ". two competing effects drive this behavior .",
    "first , for small binaries the amplitude of the gws is smaller ; the degradation of their parameter determination is due to reduced signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "larger binaries are more interesting .",
    "when such binaries enter _ lisa _ s sensitive band , they are closer to their final merger  much less inspiral remains once _",
    "_ begins measuring their waves .",
    "they therefore do not exhibit as many cycles of detector - motion - induced modulation , and so their position angles are not as well determined .",
    "in particular , we find that distance and position determination rapidly degrades as binaries are made more massive than @xmath69 .",
    "the poor parameter determination tendency of large binaries can be repaired somewhat by improving _",
    "s low frequency sensitivity .",
    "if the antenna has good sensitivity at lower frequencies , the span of data containing good information about the inspiral can be lengthened .",
    "table 2 shows how well we measure distance and position when @xmath70 is reduced from @xmath71 to @xmath72 .",
    "we now find that the distance is determined very precisely for binaries with total mass @xmath73 .",
    "sky position error is no worse than that achieved at lower masses  @xmath74 arcminutes in the best cases , and is more typically a factor of a few larger than this .",
    "the same general story holds as we move to larger redshift .",
    "figure  [ fig : z=3_m1=1e5_m2=6e5 ] duplicates the content of figure  [ fig : z=1_m1=1e5_m2=6e5 ] , but with binaries at redshift @xmath75 .",
    "likewise , tables 3 and 4 duplicate the content of tables 1 and 2 , respectively , with all binaries placed at @xmath76 .",
    "the overall parameter determinations are worsened , as we would expect  these sources are much farther away , and so have greatly reduced signal - to - noise .",
    "in addition , the larger cosmological redshift shifts the signal to lower frequencies , where much of it is lost in low - frequency noise . to quantify the impact of this effect , in table 4 we present results showing what happens when we lower @xmath77 from @xmath71 to @xmath78 .",
    "all cases with @xmath79 are substantially improved by this fix .",
    "good low frequency performance will be important for measuring high redshift binaries .",
    "the best pointing accuracy we find is @xmath80 arcminutes ; @xmath81 or larger is more typical .",
    "the luminosity distance can still be determined quite well  we find errors of a few percent in the best cases , and @xmath82 is quite common .",
    "it is worth emphasizing at this point that the results we present here are most likely somewhat conservative . by taking into account other gw harmonics @xcite and properly accounting for the high - frequency structure of _ lisa _",
    "s response @xcite , the pointing accuracy , and thus distance accuracy , can be improved by a factor of a few . properly accounting for modulations induced by spin - orbit and spin - spin coupling can also improve pointing accuracy and thus distance determination , in some cases significantly @xcite .    using a determination of @xmath5",
    ", we can _ infer _ the redshift by using knowledge of the universe s geometry ( the hubble constant , mean density of matter @xmath83 , and density of dark energy @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "this makes possible interesting analyses ( e.g. , we can map the distribution of black hole masses as a function of redshift ) , but presupposes rather than measures the distance - redshift relation .",
    "parameter estimation improves dramatically when an em counterpart to a bbh gw event can be identified .",
    "the counterpart will almost certainly be pinpointed with far greater accuracy than is possible with gws .",
    "correlations between position and distance are then broken , greatly reducing the distance error .",
    "an example of this improvement is shown for @xmath59 in figure  [ fig : pos_z=1_m1=1e5_m2=6e5 ] .",
    "the distribution of distance errors peaks near @xmath84 , and is largely confined to @xmath85 .",
    "similar results are seen for @xmath76 ( fig . ) , albeit with precision degraded by a factor of a few due to lower signal - to - noise . comparing to the lower panel of figures  [ fig : z=1_m1=1e5_m2=6e5 ] and  [ fig : z=3_m1=1e5_m2=6e5 ] , we see that associating the event with a counterpart improves distance accuracy by roughly an order of magnitude .",
    "this rough level of improvement holds over a wide band of mass and redshift .    a correlated gw / em measurement will be particularly important if the counterpart provides a redshift as well as an improved @xmath5 .",
    "such a measurement would constitute a powerful standard candle , probing the distance - redshift relation in a manner complementary to other candles , such as type ia supernovae . assuming a flat universe and a hubble constant @xmath86",
    ", we ask how well the matter density @xmath83 and dark energy equation - of - state ratio @xmath87 can be measured .",
    "figure shows estimated likelihood contours ( @xmath0@xmath88 ) in the ( @xmath89 ) plane .",
    "the dotted line shows the contour expected for measurements of 3,000 sne evenly distributed within @xmath90 ( reasonable choices for _ snap _ ) ; the solid contour is for two gw events , one each at @xmath59 and @xmath76 .",
    "( we will discuss the dashed line further below . )",
    "redshift and distance are measured with such accuracy that the contours are extremely tight even for only a small number of sources .",
    "we emphasize the current poor understanding of em counterparts to bbh gw events , although the possibility of such counterparts has been discussed for quite some time ( e.g. , begelman , blandford , & rees 1980 ) .",
    "@xcite have recently examined the evolution of gas in the environment of a merging binary , and show that there is likely to be a delayed electromagnetic afterglow .",
    "they find that the merging binary carves a hollow region in the volume of circumbinary gas .",
    "the binary separation shrinks faster than the inner edge of the hollowed region ; thus , as the coalescence proceeds , there should be no substantial accretion of material onto the system .",
    "the gas falls onto the merged remnant several years after the merger , leading to an afterglow that should be measurable by next generation x - ray telescopes .",
    "other models suggest that there may be an electromagnetic _ precursor _ to the merger , rather than a delayed glow .",
    "one example is discussed by @xcite .",
    "they argue that gas is driven onto the larger member of the binary by the secondary s inspiral , leading to super - eddington accretion . in this model , much of the inner disk",
    "may be expelled from the system in a high velocity ( @xmath91 ) outflow .",
    "such strong outflows could flag a recent or impending merger .",
    "a similar family of models @xcite explains periodic variations in the bl lac object oj 287 by a tight , eccentric binary system with mass ratio of about 1:100 . flaring outbursts from this quasar",
    "are explained as arising from the secondary periodic crossing of the primary s accretion disk .",
    "given the great payoff that would follow from associating a counterpart to a gw event , we strongly advocate continuing to develop and refine models of bbh mergers .",
    "it is worth noting that , for a small fraction of binaries ( assuming a sufficiently high event rate ) , _ lisa _ will provide an error box of @xmath92 arcmin , and an estimate of the time of merger about a day in advance .",
    "regardless of the state of theoretical predictions , we imagine that in such cases there will be great interest in searching the gw source error box for any observational counterparts to the merger . indeed , as we briefly discuss in  [ sec :",
    "counterpart2 ] , the number of relevant galaxies in the _ lisa _ error box may be fairly small , and so associating an em counterpart to the gw event may be tractable .",
    "having discussed the impressive quality of gw standard sirens , we turn now to an important caveat : the impact of gravitational lensing on the distance measurement .",
    "gws are lensed exactly as em radiation is lensed .",
    "since we expect bbh events to come from rather large redshift ( @xmath93 ) , weak lensing in the gw datasets should be common @xcite ( in addition to the occasional strongly - lensed source ) .",
    "a lens with magnification @xmath94 will distort the inferred luminosity distance to the source : if the true distance is @xmath5 , we measure @xmath95 , incurring a `` systematic '' error @xmath96 .",
    "we estimate the error such lensing is likely to introduce by convolving this quantity with the expected magnification distribution , @xmath97 @xcite ; an example of this distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : lens_dist ] . using parameters appropriate to a @xmath98cdm model of the universe , we find a mean error at @xmath99 of @xmath100 , with a variance @xmath101 ( approximating the lensing by a gaussian ; see @xcite ) .",
    "the dashed line in figure  [ fig : contour ] shows the contour we expect from the 2 gw sources when lensing errors are included .",
    "the parameter accuracies are significantly degraded .",
    "of course , this magnification bias affects _ all _ standard candles , not just gws .",
    "the rate of type ia sne , however , is high enough to sufficiently sample the entire lensing distribution , and thus average away the bias .",
    "missions such as _ snap _ are designed to observe thousands of sne at high redshift , in large part to overcome gravitational lensing . indeed , this may allow one to measure the lensing signal well enough to infer characteristics of the lensing matter @xcite .",
    "this is unlikely to be the case with bbh gws : the rate of mergers will likely be much lower than that of sne @xcite , so we can not count on enormous numbers of events .",
    "we also emphasize that we do not expect to be able to correct for gravitational lensing effects on a case - by - case basis @xcite .",
    "lensing , therefore , will introduce an insurmountable error of @xmath102@xmath1 for each individual high redshift event , significantly greater than the intrinsic distance error .",
    "in order to provide data on the distance - redshift curve , a gw event must be associated with an `` electromagnetic '' counterpart  gws provide an accurate measure of luminosity distance , but give no direct information about redshift .",
    "this is the weakest link in our analysis : we do not know whether such counterparts exist .",
    "however , a simple counting argument suggests that the number of relevant galaxies in the _ lisa _ error cube may be fairly small .",
    "we approximate the redshift distribution of source galaxies by @xmath103\\ ; , \\label{eq : galaxy_density}\\ ] ] where @xmath104 is the comoving distance ; we take @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "we normalize this to a projected number density of @xmath108 approximating the hubble deep field @xcite .",
    "as we have discussed extensively , a gw measurement of a binary black hole merger determines the position on the sky to within some error @xmath56 , and determines the luminosity distance to within some error @xmath109 . by assuming a cosmological model we can convert the measured luminosity distance , and its error , to any other desired cosmic distance measure . denoting by @xmath110 the error in comoving distance due to both the gw measurement error and the uncertainty in cosmological parameters ,",

    "we have scaled to a near best - case pointing accuracy of @xmath113 arcmin ; we emphasize that this is an optimistic , though not implausible , pointing error . from the tables",
    "it is apparent than about 5% of binaries with masses and redshifts in the _ lisa _ sweetspot have positional errors @xmath114 .",

    "the number of candidate host objects for a galactic binary black hole merger is thus likely to be tractable .",
    "what remains is to find a way to identify which of the dozen or so candidate objects is in fact the host of the merger .",
    "useful models exploring the signatures that may constitute `` precursors '' of the merger exist @xcite ; we are hopeful that such models can be extended to the ranges of mass and mass ratio of binaries that are likely to be observationally interesting to _ lisa_.    the remnant of the merger is very likely to have an irregular morphology . in addition , the host galaxy may be in an active phase .",
    "@xcite have recently developed a model for the late x - ray afterglow of a bbh merger .",
    "@xcite consider a scenario in which a merger remnant is associated with a quasar , and argue that in this case the paucity of quasars will make the identification of a counterpart significantly easier . in both of these models",
    "the merger remnant `` lights up '' , and is thus relatively easy to identify in the positional error box . even if the remnant does not light up , other information will help winnow the list of candidate host galaxies .",
    "for example , the gws will measure the masses of the black holes with good accuracy ; by using properties such as the @xmath118@xmath88 relation we can estimate specific properties ( e.g. , kinematics , luminosity ) that the host galaxy would be expected to have .",
    "observations of the _ lisa _ error boxes will no doubt be undertaken , regardless of the state of theoretical predictions .",
    "it is only by such direct observations that we will determine whether or not em counterparts to bbh gw sources can be identified .",
    "because of their potential as an independent set of standard candles , bbh gw standard sirens can make an important contribution to programs to map the distance - redshift relation over a large span of redshift .",
    "although the intrinsic precision of these candles is phenomenal , this precision will be limited in practice because of gravitational lensing . with lensing taken into account ,",
    "the accuracy of the bbh gw candle is comparable to ( or perhaps slightly better than ) a type ia sn .",
    "it is sobering to note that we are already approaching the point at which lensing , rather than intrinsic dispersion , limits our ability to use standard candles .",
    "we emphasize that the systematics of bbh events are entirely different from those of type ia sne . as such",
    ", the greatest impact of bbh standard sirens may be to verify , and thereby increase our confidence in , other standard candles .",
    "the utility of these gw standard sirens depends on the identification of an electromagnetic counterpart , through which a redshift to the source can be determined .",

    "<S> an electromagnetic counterpart may also allow determination of the event s redshift . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , bbh coalescence would constitute an extremely precise ( better than 1% ) standard candle visible to high redshift . in practice </S>",
    "<S> , gravitational lensing degrades this precision , though the candle remains precise enough to provide useful information about the distance - redshift relation . </S>",
    "<S> even if very rare , these gw standard sirens would complement , and increase confidence in , other standard candles . </S>"
