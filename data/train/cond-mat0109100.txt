    "<S> a novel mechanism is proposed for single and double qubit state manipulations in quantum computation with four - fold degenerate energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> the principle is based on starting with a four - fold degeneracy , lifting it stepwise adiabatically by a set of control parameters and performing the quantum gate operations on non - degenerate states . a particular realization of the proposed mechanism </S>",
    "<S> is suggested by using inductively coupled rf - squid loops in the recently observed macroscopic quantum tunneling regime where the energy eigen levels are directly connected with the measurable flux states . </S>",
    "<S> the one qubit and two qubit controlled operations are demonstrated explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of the flux states also allows precise read - in and read - out operations by the measurement of the flux .    </S>",
    "<S> recent advances on the experimental efforts to demonstrate the fundamental single and two bit quantum gates by ion trap@xcite and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments@xcite as well as the observation of the coherent rabi oscillations in cooper pair boxes@xcite are hinting at new challenges awaiting the realization of the quantum computational devices . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown theoretically that the basic gate operations based on the unitary transformations of the qubits can be performed by single and double qubit manipulations@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is a necessary first step that a proposed mechanism should demonstrate these fundamental operations as well as a successful read - in and read - out before any decoherence comes into play . </S>",
    "<S> a next step which is not detailed in this letter is to construct arrays of independent qubits or coupled qubit pairs to perform parallel gate operations . in our suggested mechanism </S>",
    "<S> the state space is four dimensional corresponding to the state space of a pair of qubits . </S>",
    "<S> the paired qubit states are inseparable ; nevertheless , each qubit can be manipulated individually . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism also allows controlled operations on selected bits rather easily without affecting those bits that need to be unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> a more detailed discussion of the proposed mechanism with its specific experimental realizations using rf - squid loops will be published elsewhere .      </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism is based upon coupling a pair of ideal two level systems with manifestly degenerate energy levels at the energy @xmath0 by two complex coupling parameters as indicated in fig.1a . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling @xmath1 lifts the four - fold degeneracy to two - fold ( fig.1b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second coupling @xmath2 couples the two remaining degenerate levels in each pair and lifts the degeneracy completely ( fig.1c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the states in the initial four - fold degenerate configuration at @xmath3 are labelled by @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider them to be the eigen states of some underlying non interacting system . in the qubit language below the first ( second ) bit </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the states @xmath6 are the components of the four dimensional row vector @xmath7 which is to be considered as the basis for the model hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian including the degeneracy breaking couplings is given in this four dimensional basis by the hermitian matrix @xmath8 without loss of generality we assumed that the couplings are _ real and positive _ and that they are applied adiabatically in the order @xmath1 first and @xmath2 second ( the order is commutative ) with @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the diagonalizing matrices for independent couplings are unitary transformations acting on the four dimensional basis . </S>",
    "<S> these are @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 as given by @xmath14 when both couplings are turned on , the hamiltonian ( [ prl.1 ] ) is diagonalized by @xmath15 as @xmath16 which correspond to the levels in fig.1c . for arbitrary couplings @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> the eigen energies are all nondegenerate and they are distributed symmetrically around the major center @xmath0 and the two minor ones @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the single and double qubit quantum gate operations are performed ideally by manipulating the strengths of at least one of the coupling constants and making use of the invariance of the major center under adiabatic changes of both couplings and of the two minor centers under that of @xmath2 . in fig.1c </S>",
    "<S> we have indicated the eigenstates with up and down arrows . in the double - squid model considered below </S>",
    "<S> they correspond to the flux states . </S>",
    "<S> these states are connected with the initial basis states @xmath6 by @xmath19 note that the ordering of the @xmath6 basis is made with respect to the ordering of the energy eigen values of the flux states on the left hand side in ( [ updownst.1 ] ) which is different than the ordering used for constructing the hamiltonian matrix ( [ prl.1 ] ) . for later convenience </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the short notation @xmath20      physically , this suggested four state mechanism can be realized by using inductively coupled rf - squids as depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the squids must operate in the macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) regime@xcite which requires temperatures on the order of mili kelvin for standard josephson junctions . </S>",
    "<S> the four level system of fig.1a is constructed by preparing two identical squids a and b in which each qubit is represented , to a good approximation , by its two lowest energy eigen states ( denoted as @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) ; in the mqt regime these are nearly degenerate ( pseudo - degenerate ) in energy ( due to the fluctuations in the flux ) compared to the next ( third ) level .    a qubit which is close to being ideal </S>",
    "<S> is characterized by an isolated hypothetical two - level system with a high qubit quality ratio @xmath23 , where @xmath0 and @xmath24 are the two lowest levels and @xmath25 is the next ( well - separated ) level . in the case of manifest degeneracy , i.e. @xmath26 one obtains @xmath27 , the ideal case . for the realistic case here using coupled squids , </S>",
    "<S> we search for a pseudo degenerate configuration ( by performing a numerical search at different parameter values ) in which we obtain sufficiently high qubit quality factors on the order of @xmath28 . in fig.3 </S>",
    "<S> the calculated wavefunctions for the two lowest states of a symmetric double - well single - squid potential is plotted for the specific parameter values which are junction capacitance @xmath29 , the loop inductance @xmath30 and the potential modulation parameter@xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the critical josephson current , @xmath33 is the superconducting current in the loop and @xmath34 is the superconducting flux quantum @xmath35 . in the numerical calculations the range of the junction and </S>",
    "<S> the loop parameters are chosen such that the pseudo - degenerate eigen states are located in the double well , whereas the third level is above the central maximum of the double well potential . for the flux dominated regime the josephson energy @xmath36 is expected to be much larger than the charging energy @xmath37 in the junctions . considering that the sum of these energies is fixed ( @xmath38 is the total energy in the noninteracting squid loop ) , we find for our parameters @xmath39 for the symmetric configuration of the double well potential . if the symmetric configuration is tilted , the additional level splitting raises the charging energy . for the range of interest of the bias flux ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) a drop to @xmath40 in the above ratio is observed as a result of the tilting . the pseudo- degenerate single squid states @xmath21 and @xmath22 have respectively even and odd parities . </S>",
    "<S> we will refer to these states as the one - bit parity basis . </S>",
    "<S> the odd and even superpositions of the parity states are given by @xmath41 and @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> these are the single - well localized flux states . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we refer to them as the one - bit flux basis . </S>",
    "<S> the single - well localized means that these one - bit states actually refer to a single squid where they are well confined to a single well of the one - squid double - well potential . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated flux states corresponding to the chosen squid parameters above are also shown in fig.3 ( the solid triangles ) . </S>",
    "<S> we now change from the single bit - single squid to the double bit- double squid configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the case for two identical squid loops in the pseudo - degenerate regime with no mutual interaction is given by fig.1a . </S>",
    "<S> inductively coupling these two identical squid loops in fig.2 by a weak inductance @xmath43 , lifts the four - fold degeneracy to two - fold degeneracy . in the coupled squid model the weak mutual inductance </S>",
    "<S> can not be varied after fabrication . </S>",
    "<S> this mutual inductance corresponds to the coupling @xmath1 ( fig.1 ) and we believe that @xmath44 is a reasonable range to consider in the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> once the squids are manifactured , @xmath45 is fixed , therefore the four fold degenerate configuration in fig.1a is out of reach . </S>",
    "<S> however we still have leverage on the second coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this second coupling is the tilt of the symmetrical josephson potential of the two squids simultaneously deriving both potentials to unsymmetric configurations by means of an additionally applied flux @xmath46 ( the total flux is @xmath47 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is modelled by the second coupling @xmath2 which lifts the remaining two - fold degeneracy completely . </S>",
    "<S> the combined effects of the mutual inductance , which we now consider to be @xmath48 , and the tilt can be calculated numerically by diagonalizing the inductively coupled two - squid hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated eigenenergies are plotted against the tilting parameter @xmath49 in fig.4 . </S>",
    "<S> the configuration @xmath50 ( i.e. @xmath51 ) corresponds to the symmetric squid potential . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of the schrdinger equation for this potential and this coupled squid configuration has two closely spaced energy levels ( at the mentioned parameter range above ) comprising the best pseudo - degenerate approximation we ever found to the manifest double degeneracy in fig.1b . </S>",
    "<S> at this point we read from the vertical axis in fig.4 that @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> as the double - well potentials are tilted in parallel and simultaneously in both squids the shift obtained for each eigenenergy is approximately linear in the bias flux @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the coupling can be primarily represented as a first order perturbation in @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the fig.1 with the calculations shown in fig.4 indicates that the coupled rf - squid model is in essence an isolated four - level quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> recently , schrdinger cat states have been obtained experimentally by manipulating these two couplings in the mqt regime.@xcite for the physically relevant range @xmath54 the centers of the splitting energies in fig.4 also respect the manifest conservation principle of the energy centers in fig.1 . in fact , in the numerical calculations we found a shift smaller than @xmath55 in the energy centers for the whole range @xmath56 . in this paper we will refer to two different representations of the basis states for two coupled squids . </S>",
    "<S> the first , which is the even and the odd states of the mutually noninteracting squids , is represented by the vector @xmath57 as in section a. here in the state @xmath58 @xmath59 represents the parity state of the squid a and @xmath60 represents that of squid b. we will designate @xmath61 as the _ two - bit parity basis_. the second , which is the set of flux states for the coupled and tilted squids , i.e. both couplings are nonzero , is represented by @xmath62 which we refer to as the _ two - bit flux basis_.      according to the hamiltonian ( [ prl.1 ] ) , the eigen levels in fig.1b corresponding to @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the doubly degenerate states @xmath65 . explicitly these are , @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath68 , and , @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 . if @xmath72 is also turned on as in fig.1c , the non - degenerate energy eigenstates become the two - bit flux states defined in eq.([updownst.1 ] ) and written explicitly as @xmath73 the choice of the basis in which the fundamental quantum gates are to be operated should be determined by the accessibility of the input and output states by the measurement mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> this condition actually means that all information in the relative magnitudes and the phases of these states should be measurable . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute values of the amplitudes of the flux states are directly measurable whereas their relative phase factors do not couple to the measurement ( see below ) . since it is crucial to be able to read and write the relative phase between the flux states , we choose the two - bit parity basis @xmath74 instead of the two - bit flux basis @xmath75 to perform the gate operations . </S>",
    "<S> the flux basis is used for the i / o operations . before and after performing the logic </S>",
    "<S> gates it is therefore needed to switch between the @xmath61 and the @xmath76 bases . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the matrices @xmath10 and @xmath12 are two - bit hadamard transformations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it can be verified that @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the @xmath79 unit matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix @xmath80 is the one bit hadamard transformation . the transformation from the natural eigenbasis @xmath76 to the parity basis @xmath61 </S>",
    "<S> can therefore be performed by two successive two - bit hadamard transformations . in this way </S>",
    "<S> any phase information of a quantum state encoded in @xmath61 basis contributes to the relative amplitudes of the @xmath76 basis yielding direct accesibility to the measurement . </S>",
    "<S> this transformation can be summarized as @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> the effective result of this transformation is that each state in the parity basis is finaly assigned a distinct eigen energy as shown below . </S>",
    "<S> this transformation is equivalent to effectively assigning each component @xmath6 of the @xmath61 basis an energy eigenvalue . </S>",
    "<S> the logic operations are then performed on the @xmath61 basis . </S>",
    "<S> we now demonstrate the fundamental single - qubit operations , i.e. the phase flip and the hadamard transformation .    </S>",
    "<S> _ single qubit operations : _    although the mechanism is based on four states , it is possible to identify two individual flux qubits and perform single bit operations on each one independently . in the parity basis , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath82 we assign the first bit as the control ( qubit no.1 ) and the second bit as the target ( qubit no.2 ) . by definition </S>",
    "<S> , the single qubit operations are performed on the target in the four dimensional state space unconditionally from the state of the control bit . whereas the controlled operations ( two - qubit operations ) are performed when the control bit is in a particular , i.e ( @xmath83 or @xmath84 ) state . with this convention </S>",
    "<S> we now start with the single qubit operations .    </S>",
    "<S> * i. * the phase flip is a special case of the phase evolution described by @xmath85 the phase flip is obtained in ( [ z.1a ] ) at @xmath86 which implies that the state of the second bit is changed as @xmath87 and @xmath88 independent from the state of the first bit . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown below that this can be obtained as a direct sum of two controlled phase flips .    the phase evolution @xmath89 in eq.([z.1a ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is achieved in the two coupled squid realization in two steps . </S>",
    "<S> we switch the coupling configuration of the system to @xmath90 which makes the states @xmath91 and @xmath92 degenerate at the major center @xmath0 . by this switching , the remaining ( nondegenerate ) states , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. @xmath93 and @xmath94 are now at the energies @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively . the four state system </S>",

    "<S> an identical phase evolution is then performed on the states @xmath91 and @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> the net transformation is given by @xmath103 which , after factoring out the overall phase @xmath104 is equivalent to eq.([z.1a ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> similarly , the second bracket denotes the same controlled phase flip when the control bit is in the @xmath83 state . </S>",

    "<S> the time scale required for the gate operations can be rougly considered to be independent from the particular gate operation . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the operational time as @xmath129 where @xmath130 describes the energy difference of the states at the configuration where the gate operation is performed . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , a typical scale is the phase flip @xmath131 can be read off from fig.4 at the degeneracy point @xmath132 . </S>",

    "<S> the switching time is possible for less than @xmath135 between two gate operations . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by comparing these two time scales , we estimate that the gate operations are dictated by the switching time .    </S>",

    "<S> a realization of this system using rf - squids in the flux regime is made in which only one of the couplings is variable . </S>",
    "<S> physical examples in which both couplings vary are very likely to exist but currently unknown to us . in that case </S>",
    "<S> an ideal realization of the proposed mechanism is possible with the particularly added feature of fig.1a namely storing the computed information by suppressing the energetic interference between the states . </S>",
