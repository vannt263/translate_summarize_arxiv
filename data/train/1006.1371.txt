    "[ fig : aspect]-[fig : model ] is computationally more efficient , but , as in the experiments @xcite , it leads to more scatter and less definition in the resulting stream features . since the larger grain mass increases the collisional kinetic energy , the strength of cohesion required for droplet formation is also increased .",

    "we refer the reader to the review by s. hermingaus @xcite .    we do not include interactions between the particles and an interstitial fluid ( air ) since experiments performed under different levels of vacuum showed that the basic features of droplet formation do not depend on the presence of air drag @xcite . for the results reported here , we set @xmath15 , @xmath16  nm and the specific grain density to that of glass ( @xmath17  2.5  kg / m@xmath18 ) , and we explore the effects of collisions and cohesion by varying @xmath10 and @xmath11 .        the results shown in fig .  [ fig : clusters ] for @xmath7  100  @xmath0 m grains falling from a @xmath1  2  mm aperture reproduce the two types of behavior observed in experiments for similarly sized glass spheres with short - ranged cohesive interactions of comparable strength ( as was confirmed by afm @xcite ) , namely spraying and droplet formation . for a highly cohesive , highly dissipative stream , as shown in fig .  [",

    "when the cohesive strength was reduced in the experiments by roughening the particle surfaces ( also confirmed by afm ) , droplet formation ceased and the stream behaved more like a collimated spray .",
    "the same qualitative change is reproduced when the cohesive strength is decreased in the simulations [ fig .",
    "[ fig : clusters](e)-(h ) ] . fig .",
    "[ fig : clusters](a)-(d ) also shows that droplet formation goes hand in hand with the development of spatial heterogeneities in the relative particle velocities : regions of larger relative velocity deform into necks and stay ` hot ' even for a short time after they break , while the interior of the droplets is ` colder ' and they appear to be essentially frozen once the separation process is complete [ for details of this evolution see supplemental movies @xcite ] .",
    "the overall shape of the droplets can be characterized by their length to width aspect ratio @xmath19 . for the purpose of establishing shapes , height and width data",

    "[ fig : aspect](b ) , for a given inelasticity the length and width of droplets increases with the amount of cohesion .",
    "these observations are in contrast with inviscid liquid streams undergoing rayleigh - plateau breakup .",
    "first , liquid breakup has unstable wavelengths only for @xmath23 ( here we use @xmath24 to distinguish the liquid lengthscale from the granular lengthscale ) @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the definitions of these aspect ratios are slightly different , with @xmath6 ( the local unperturbed jet diameter ) as the denominator in the liquid case and @xmath25 ( the droplet width ) in the granular case .",
    "however , if we make the more direct comparison and calculate @xmath26 for the granular case , we find that @xmath27 , drawing an even clearer distinction between the granular and liquid streams .",
    "this comparison is still complicated by the fact that the granular stream is continually being stretched axially by gravity , and if we account for this by noting that the length of fully formed droplets is necessarily longer than the corresponding lengthscale at the aperture ( which we will call @xmath28 ) , we deviate still further from the liquid case arriving at @xmath29 .",
    "second , for inviscid liquids undergoing rayleigh - plateau breakup , the size of droplets is independent of the surface tension .",
    "in fact , the only parameter governing the size of droplets is the aperture diameter , with @xmath30 determining the minimum unstable wavelength and @xmath31 yielding the fastest growing wavelength @xcite . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : aspect](b ) , the droplet size does depend on the cohesive strength in the granular case . on a microscopic level",

    "this depth was chosen to allow sufficient time for some of the salient stream features to emerge ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : clusters ] ) .",
    "the images highlight the different regimes of stream behavior , but also reveal that it is possible for streams in different regions of phase space to appear nearly indistinguishable by shape alone , such as figs .",

    "[ fig : phase](a ) ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) and  [ fig : phase](b ) ( @xmath58  nn , @xmath57 ) both appear to be diffuse sprays based on the 2-dimensional projection of particle positions alone , but the color coded images reveal a substantial number of contacting pairs for the @xmath20 nn stream and virtually none for the zero cohesion stream .",
    "we refer to streams that evolve into isolated particles as ` sprays ' and distinguish this behavior from the formation of small aggregates in the ` clustering ' regime .",
    "as an example , even though a stream corresponding to @xmath59 and @xmath60 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : phase](f ) ] appears much denser and more collimated , there are only a few scattered contacting pairs . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase](e ) ( @xmath61 nn , @xmath62 ) , however , most grains have at least one contacting neighbor and some have as many as four or five .",
    "this already indicates that , while the inelasticity strongly affects the degree to which a stream remains collimated , a non - zero cohesive force is essential for maintaining contacts between adjacent grains .",
    "coloring the data points in the phase diagram by the average contact number @xmath63 at @xmath64 4 cm reveals no sharp boundaries between different regimes but rather gradual crossovers .    towards larger cohesive forces and smaller coefficients of restitution",
    "lies the droplet forming regime [ c.f .",
    "[ fig : phase](h ) ] discussed already in connection with figs .",
    "[ fig : clusters](a)-(d ) .",
    "the behavior here is reminiscent of liquid flows from a small opening and individual droplets can contain hundreds of grains .",
    "if we increase the cohesion even more and approach the right - hand edge of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] , we enter a regime in which there is no longer a steady outflow from the aperture . in this ` dripping ' regime large aggregates of grains slowly ooze through the aperture [ fig .",
    "[ fig : phase](d ) ] .",
    "once the weight of these aggregates becomes too large , big chunks break off and pull away . further increasing the cohesive force , the grains",
    "become permanently stuck inside the hopper and all flow stops .    since droplets and clusters are aggregates of grains with vanishing relative velocity , it is tempting to use the notion of a granular temperature to characterize the roles of inelasticity and cohesion . in the kinetic theory of granular flows ,",
    "the granular temperature is obtained by computing local deviations of grain velocities from a coarse - grained mean velocity field @xmath65 @xcite . in freely falling streams",
    ", however , the velocity field varies strongly in both time and space .",
    "nevertheless , to capture the variations in relative velocities we can calculate a mean squared velocity deviation @xmath66 of each grain relative to its neighbors within a small region . below we will loosely refer to this measure as a granular temperature , but it is important to remember that it contains contributions from collisional velocity fluctuations and as well as from gradients in the mean velocity across a grain s neighborhood .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : temp_plot ] we plot the mean squared velocity deviations versus depth for a sampling of parameter values from the representative regions of the phase space . inside the hopper and sufficiently far above the aperture , velocity deviations are small and grains move in unison .",
    "as the aperture is approached from above , shear ` heats ' up the granular medium , leading to a pronounced peak in @xmath67 . at this point ,",
    "the rms velocity deviations reach a value that is a significant fraction of the mean outflow velocity , @xmath68  10  cm / s .",
    "we find that the maximum deviations are nearly the same for a wide range of cohesive forces and inelasticities , suggesting that the dynamics inside the hopper and the initial flow conditions right at the aperture are largely unaffected by changing these parameters .",
    "once the particles leave the hopper the ` cooling ' phase begins and differences emerge . figs .",
    "[ fig : temp_plot](b ) and ( c ) show separately the transverse and axial contributions to @xmath69 . for weakly cohesive streams , and irrespective of @xmath10 ,",
    "the large-@xmath70 behavior is seen to approach a power law for both contributions , albeit with the exponent of the transverse component being slightly smaller .",
    "streams that undergo strong droplet formation ( green and blue traces ) show deviations from a simple power law , exhibiting first an excess of fluctuations ( c.f .",
    "the shear visible in the neck regions in fig .  [ fig : clusters ] ) followed by a rapid drop of the local droplet temperature after break - up , as cohesive forces bind grains together .        in the absence of drop formation",
    "the observed axial cooling follows , to very good approximation , the behavior expected just from the stretching of streams of non - interacting particles , i.e. , simply from the velocity gradient due to gravity . as particles fall out of the aperture , they acquire a free fall velocity @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the axial velocity at the aperture and @xmath73 is the gravitational acceleration . the axial velocity deviations over a local range @xmath50",
    "are then computed as @xmath74 this predicts not only the @xmath75 decay of the axial temperature at large @xmath70 , but , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : temp_plot](d ) ( dashed line ) , fits the data of non - droplet - forming streams quantitatively from the aperture on down ( in these fits the initial velocity @xmath72 is known and the only free parameter is the neighborhood size @xmath50 ) . since @xmath70 is proportional to the square of the falling time , the axial temperature in fig .",
    "[ fig : temp_plot](d ) drops as @xmath76 , coincidentally the same behavior as predicted for the early stages of a non - expanding granular gas @xcite .",
    "we note that this differs from the @xmath77 decay proposed by amarouchene _",
    "@xcite based on fluctuation measurements at the surface of streams falling in air .",
    "while the mean squared velocity deviations reveal the important role played by gravity in stretching and thereby diluting and cooling the stream , they are not particularly sensitive to details introduced by inelasticity or cohesion .",
    "we see this directly in fig .",
    "[ fig : temp_plot ] where temperature curves for a range of @xmath11 and @xmath10 values effectively collapse on top of each other except when the stream undergoes gross changes in the behavior , such as the onset of large droplets .",
    "it is therefore important to explore additional and possibly more useful indicators of the roles of @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "one of these indicators is the depth dependence of the average contact number , @xmath63 . to emphasize changes relative to the initial particle configuration near the aperture",
    ", we normalize @xmath63 by the average initial contact number , @xmath78 , measured at @xmath79  mm . for cohesive streams in the clustering , droplet forming , or dripping regimes",
    ", the normalized contact number always increases with @xmath70 [ fig.[fig : contact](a ) ] .",
    "contrarily , in non - cohesive streams , @xmath80 always decreases , independent of the inelasticity and even in streams with restitution coefficients approaching zero .",
    "since the interparticle distance , and hence the collision rate , in the stream steadily decreases with depth , the usual pressure gradients associated with inelastic collisions are rendered less effective , and there is no restoring force to keep contacting grains together . as a result , even the slightest separation velocity  essentially ensured by the velocity gradient  will eventually cause a cluster of contacting grains to drift apart . only in cohesive streams",
    "is it possible to form particle aggregates that will remain stable against small velocity differences in the absence of further collisions .",
    "while the normalized average contact number draws a clear distinction between cohesive and non - cohesive streams , it does not differentiate cleanly between the more subtle consequences of cohesion .",
    "such differences are highlighted when we go beyond nearest neighbor contacts and look at the full network of particles connected to a given grain .",
    "we do this by defining the network size @xmath81 as the average number of grains connected to a grain at a distance @xmath70 below the aperture ( see appendix for averaging procedure ) .",
    "we define two grains as connected if a path exists between them that consists of pairs of grains whose center - to - center distances are no larger than @xmath82 . fig .",
    "[ fig : contact](b ) shows the results for streams with @xmath83 and a range of @xmath11 values .",
    "the behavior of @xmath81 can be classified into three basic categories .",
    "for @xmath60 we find that @xmath81 monotonically decreases toward unity , in agreement with the conclusions drawn from the evolution of @xmath63 .",
    "this is the spraying regime . for @xmath11 less than about @xmath84  100  nn , @xmath81 first dips sharply as particles leave the hopper ,",
    "but then undergoes a prolonged period of slow growth , after which it saturates at values less than @xmath84  30 grains .",
    "we interpret this as the signature of clusters that form by collide - and - capture events .",
    "the dynamics in this regime consist of an intricate interplay between the effects of the velocity profile at the aperture , the stretching and diluting of the stream via gravity , and low energy collisions which permit initially separated grains to become permanently connected .",
    "the capture process can start once the stream has fallen and cooled to a low enough level such that the cohesive energy @xmath85 exceeds the pre - collisional kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "this does not continue indefinitely , however , because the stretching due to gravity drives the collision frequency toward zero .",
    "this situation is remarkably similar to the trade - off between cooling and dilution observed in free expansion experiments on cryogenic he jets @xcite .    for larger @xmath11 , between 100  nn and 2000  nn",
    ", the behavior reverses .",
    "now @xmath81 quickly increases to a peak value before settling down to its asymptotic value at large @xmath70 .",
    "this is the droplet regime .",
    "the initial increase in @xmath81 is due to the liquid - like narrowing of the stream below the aperture , where the associated radial influx and sufficiently large cohesive energy work together to favor network growth .",
    "the subsequent decrease signals the break - up of the stream into droplets . the initial network growth for the strongly cohesive streams becomes smaller as the cohesive force is increased . at the same time , the peak network size saturates at some maximum value ( @xmath84  1100 grains ) .",
    "we also see that the break - up is more pronounced in more cohesive streams , i.e. the sudden drop in @xmath81 occurs more rapidly [ inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : contact](b ) ] . further inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : contact](b ) reveals that the location of this dropoff moves up toward the aperture as @xmath11 is increased , suggesting a natural progression from droplet forming to dripping streams .",
    "the qualitatively different shapes of the @xmath81 curves reveal a fundamental difference between clustering and droplet forming streams .",
    "a clustering stream starts as ` gas ' of individual grains or collections of small network fragments which grow larger by capturing additional particles during collisions .",
    "in contrast , a droplet forming stream starts as large network of grains that eventually breaks into smaller portions , again similar to the formation of drops in liquid he jets @xcite . a potential crossover between these two modes can be identified by tracing the asymptotic , large-@xmath70 limit of @xmath81 as a function of cohesive strength . in fig .",
    "[ fig : contact](c ) we plot the saturation network size @xmath86 , defined as @xmath87  20  cm  @xmath88 vs. @xmath11 .",
    "clustering streams undergo accelerated growth in @xmath89 as @xmath11 is increased , ( e.g. before about @xmath90  nn ) while droplet forming streams exhibit a slow turnover in which the growth rate decreases .",
    "if we inspect fig .",
    "[ fig : contact](b ) more closely , we see that the curves undergo the qualitative change from ` slow growth ' ( clustering ) to ` eventual breakup ' ( droplet formation ) around @xmath90  nn as well .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dv0](a ) we examine how @xmath11 affects the dynamics of the stream breakup in the droplet forming regime .",
    "the average separation velocity between adjacent droplets exhibits a weak dependance on @xmath11 .",
    "the averages of the initial @xmath91 and final @xmath92 separation velocities are essentially identical , though the distribution of @xmath51 is considerably wider due to the interactions between droplets as they separate .",
    "when @xmath48 is plotted against the mean number of grains in individual pairs , @xmath93 , the data for different @xmath11 collapse onto a single curve [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dv0](b ) ] , indicating that the dependence of @xmath91 on @xmath11 stems entirely from the increased network size at larger cohesive forces .",
    "the data similarly collapse when plotted against the center of mass distance between the clusters at the aperture @xmath94 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dv0](c ) ] . from eq .",
    "[ eq : v_of_z ] , the velocity difference of two points in the stream near the aperture and separated by a distance @xmath95 is @xmath96 the fit shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dv0 ] yields @xmath97  1.4  cm / s , reasonably close to the value 1.7 cm / s predicted from just the free - fall velocity profile .",
    "this shows that the droplet separation is primarily driven by the free - fall velocity gradient along the stream and is set by the initial droplet separation , which is on the order of a few grain diameters .",
    "this scale is in agreement with the extrapolated value of the length scale measured in previous work on granular streams @xcite .",
    "so far , the simulations have allowed us to reproduce experimental results and access data that would otherwise be impossible to measure .",
    "we can also use them to test possible mechanisms for the regions in phase space outlined in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] . for the capture phase ,",
    "it is natural to simply think of the stream as a gas of colliding grains . in this scenario ,",
    "structure formation takes place mainly through collide - and - capture events .",
    "the picture is simplified if we assume all collisions are binary .",
    "as pointed in @xcite , the minimum relative pre - collision velocity @xmath98 two particles must have in order to separate after a collision is @xmath99 if details regarding the density and the distribution of relative particle velocities at the aperture are fairly constant , it is natural to expect that the mean contact number @xmath54 will depend primarily on @xmath98 , i.e. @xmath11 , @xmath100 , and @xmath10 .",

    "streams with lower @xmath10 systematically deviate to higher mean coordination numbers .",
    "this observation is consistent with the fact that the introduction of a cohesive force leads to an effective coefficient of restitution @xcite , in our case given by @xmath104 it follows that even if two dense granular flows consist of particles with the same capture velocity , the one with the higher @xmath10 ( and consequently @xmath105 ) should exhibit more structure formation .",
    "deep in the droplet forming regime , it is tempting to look for a lengthscale that falls out from our free parameters since the size of droplets scales with the cohesive energy .",
    "we can begin to picture a mechanism for the selection of this lengthscale by recalling two observations .",
    "the first is that well into the droplet regime virtually all grains leaving the aperture are connected in one large network .",
    "the second is that the velocity gradient at the aperture plays an important role . putting these together , one might suspect that droplet formation is closely related to the kinetic energy imprinted on the stream by the gradient . as a simplified model",

    "we partition this stream into segments of length @xmath28 which will eventually become droplets . for an individual droplet ,",

    "[ fig : dv0](a ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath112 is identically zero , i.e. no energy remains in the form of particle vibrations or bulk rotations .",
    "the work @xmath109 is more difficult to estimate because it depends strongly on the dynamics of the droplet formation process .",
    "we know it is present and non - negligible by the separation dynamics shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dv_dz ] , which also suggest that this work grows with @xmath11 .",
    "we can estimate its magnitude by noting that it is just the total force in the cross section between the droplets , @xmath117 , integrated over the effective length which the force pulls . in the rest frame of our droplet , this work is approximately @xmath118 where @xmath119 depends on the time to breakup @xmath120 , the velocity gradient @xmath106 , and the cohesive force @xmath11 .",
    "the assumption of a constant velocity gradient is not perfect , since interactions with neighboring droplets and internal dissipation can , in principle , alter it .",
    "however , we have seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : temp_plot](d ) that even droplet forming streams initially exhibit the same @xmath75 decay in the mean square velocity deviations seen in non - droplet forming streams , indicating that deviations from a constant gradient are only significant close to break up .",

    "imagine a single droplet ( with no neighbors ) of length @xmath28 and initial axial velocity gradient @xmath106 .",
    "the particles in this droplet are perfectly elastic and frictionless . assuming the total cohesive energy remains constant , the droplet can remain intact if the energy stored in bonds exceeds the initial kinetic energy , i.e. @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the total number of bonds in the drop . the number of bonds @xmath125 should grow linearly with the droplet length ( @xmath126 ) , which implies that the maximum length our droplet can be in order to remain intact is @xmath127 . since we assumed no bonds",
    "are broken , energy is conserved and the particles will exchange kinetic for potential energy as bonds are ` stretched ' and retracted . if we now assume that during this process the number of bonds actually grows [ as it does in fig .",
    "[ fig : contact](a ) ] , our stream is able to counteract even more kinetic energy ( note that creating new bonds adds no kinetic energy since our force is hysteretic ) .",
    "we also expect that the number of bonds gained should scale linearly with the length .",
    "thus our droplet length can now grow to @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the number of bonds gained per unit length . as more bonds are gained , the droplet finds itself in a deeper effective potential well and must have more kinetic energy ",
    "more length  to escape . the same is true if we add dissipation in the form of friction or inelasticity . for each dissipative term added , more kinetic energy can be extinguished and this produces longer droplets .",
    "the work done by neighboring droplets has the opposite effect , reducing the maximum stable @xmath28 .",
    "however , for droplet formation we must always have @xmath130 .",
    "the local rearrangements and deformations that lead to this dissipative term are easily seen in our supplemental movie @xcite , where we show the evolution of a single droplet .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs in liquids , where increasing the viscosity leads to larger droplet masses in the slow dripping from a tube @xcite .    assuming the contact distribution and collision dynamics are uniform across the length of the droplet , dissipation from friction and inelasticity",
    "should also scale with the length of the droplet , so that we can write the sum of @xmath110 and @xmath113 as @xmath131 where @xmath132 includes contributions from all initial and gained bonds , friction and inelasticity .",
    "putting our proposed forms for @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath133 into eq .",
    "[ eq : delta_k ] , we arrive at an expression for the initial length of droplets : @xmath134    although precisely predicting @xmath28 requires analytical expressions for @xmath119 and @xmath132 as a function of all our simulation parameters and initial conditions , we can make some progress by just looking at the scaling with @xmath11 .",
    "we have already argued that @xmath119 ( and consequently @xmath109 ) and @xmath110 scale linearly with @xmath11 . since there is no structure formation for @xmath60",
    ", we expect that @xmath113 ( and consequently @xmath132 ) also scales linearly with @xmath11 to first order .",
    "this implies @xmath135 where @xmath136 is a constant with units of stress .",
    "this toy model makes a number of important simplifications .",
    "foremost is the fact that near the aperture the ` real ' streams are more complicated than we have assumed . much of this results from the presence of radial velocity gradients ( both @xmath137 and @xmath138 ) , which change the initial kinetic energy and the initial rate at which energy is lost .    nonetheless , in comparing our idealized model with data from the simulations we find good agreement .",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : model ] we plot the droplet lengthscale measured at the aperture as a function of the cohesive force along with a fit to eq .",
    "[ eq : model_fit ] with @xmath136 as a free parameter .",
    "as can be seen , the @xmath139 scaling of the model is consistent with behavior found in the simulations .",
    "we see that at @xmath140 nn , the initial lengthscale is approximately equal to the particle size ( @xmath141  @xmath0 m ) . intuitively , one might expect this model to break down once the initial lengthscale drops below the particle size , and the fact that the force at which this occurs is very near to the crossover identified in fig .  [",
    "fig : contact ] is highly suggestive .",
    "the fit corresponds to @xmath142 nn / mm@xmath143 . referring back to eqs .",
    "[ eq : pre_model ]  and  [ eq : model_fit ] , we see that this quantity encapsulates the ratio of the initial kinetic energy @xmath108 to the net energy lost @xmath144 ( divided by factors of @xmath11 and @xmath28 to give the appropriate units ) . physically , it is a proxy for the stream s effectiveness to counteract its initial kinetic energy through cohesion and dissipation . while it would be preferable to have a larger range of data to fit to ,",
    "this is not possible in our stream geometry . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] , the droplet forming regime gives way to the dripping regime quite rapidly just beyond the maximum force used in fig .",

    "the single fit parameter has the value @xmath142  nn / mm@xmath143.,scaledwidth=44.0% ]",
    "our results show that freely falling granular streams provide a highly sensitive probe of minute , local - level interactions between granular particles .",
    "gravity stretches and cools the granular stream , similar to what happens during the expansion phase in molecular jets .",
    "this makes it possible to distinguish between situations with and without attractive particle interactions , irrespective of the coefficient of restitution .",
    "attractive interactions that are weak ( nanonewtons ) , short - ranged ( tens to hundreds of nanometers ) and thus hard to quantify _ in - situ _ with other techniques are easily detected by tracking the formation of particle clusters or droplets .",
    "in particular , our findings demonstrate that the average number of particles in a cluster or droplet , given by the saturation network size , is directly related to the cohesive strength .",
    "this also implies a simple experimental means for detecting small amounts of interparticle cohesion without the need to follow the stream in the co - moving frame : from images taken in the large- z limit the number of particles per droplet can be estimated , providing an upper bound on the cohesive energy and making these streams a potentially useful tool for other areas of granular physics where cohesive forces are known to play important roles but are difficult to quantify , such as industrial fluidized beds @xcite and accretion in protoplanetary disks @xcite .",
    "nearly all aspects of stream behavior are affected by the free - fall velocity profile imparted on the stream at the aperture .",
    "this observation suggests that the breakup mechanism itself may be a consequence of this gradient . with this in mind",
    ", we developed a toy model in which droplets are formed as the kinetic energy associated with the gradient and the work done by neighboring droplets competes with the energy stored and bonds and lost to dissipation .",
    "this model predicts that adjacent droplets should separate with constant velocity , which is confirmed in the simulations . using this model to determine the length of droplets requires some knowledge of how the energy is transferred between the initial and final states .",
    "predicting this is difficult because energy is lost to inelasticity , friction , and the rearrangement of bonds , all of which depend on the microscopic dynamics during the breakup process .",
    "nonetheless , we expect that , to first order , these terms should just scale linearly with the cohesive force .",
    "this results in the initial droplet lengthscale scaling like @xmath139 .",
    "this prediction is consistent with our data for droplet forming streams in the range of data available to our stream geometry .",
    "our results indicate that in two very important ways granular breakup differs from inviscid rayleigh - plateau breakup .",
    "first is the fact that in the liquid case the lengthscale over which breakup can occur is independent of the strength of the interaction ; surface tension is only required to start the process . for granular breakup ,",
    "our results show that the size of droplets grows with the cohesive energy , indicating a competing mechanism is present .",
    "second , in granular breakup dissipation plays a primary role , while in liquid breakup dissipation is not even necessary . in inviscid liquid breakup",
    ", droplets actually end up with more kinetic energy than they start with .",
    "this is a consequence of energy conservation ; in order for a liquid stream to reduce its surface energy , its kinetic energy must increase . in granular breakup",
    ", it is clear that fully formed droplets have virtually no kinetic energy in the co - moving frame .    in a liquid stream",
    ", it is the thermal nature of the molecules which allows them to explore phase space and ultimately reduce the surface energy of the stream .",
    "macroscopic granular systems , on the other hand , are athermal , and if we imagine a well - connected column of grains with no macroscopic velocity gradients , we would never see breakup . in the presence of a velocity gradient , grains have the opportunity to rearrange in a systematic way that maintains high density ,",
    "allows access to energetically favorable configurations ( by increasing the number of bonds ) , and leads to energy loss via dissipation . in this sense ,",
    "the kinetic energy from the velocity gradient in a granular stream plays a similar role to the thermal energy in a liquid stream in that it provides a way for the stream to explore otherwise unaccessible configurations .",
    "however , in the absence of external energy input this kinetic energy is quickly lost as the grains explore new configurations and is essentially zero once the drops separate .",
    "combined with the extremely low effective surface tension , this prevents the granular droplets from assuming the smooth spherical shape of liquid drops .",
    "while our model and predictions can account for many of the trends and behaviors seen in both simulations and experiments , they also raise a number of important questions .",
    "one of these is how the break - up is changed , or if it even occurs , with other interactions such as conservative potentials or frictionless particles , since changing these will significantly affect how the particles can redistribute their kinetic energy . also , while our model produces scaling for @xmath11 consistent with the simulations , it is not able to determine what happens between the initial and final states , nor is it able to explain why the aspect ratios of fully formed droplets are largely independent of the stream parameters . as a final question",
    ", one has to wonder how the initial , local particle packing inside the stream near the aperture affects the breakup since the collision dynamics and the stream s ability to create new bonds will be strongly affected by this parameter .    finally , the fact that already minute amounts of cohesion can give rise to cluster or droplet formation provides a new perspective for interpreting other recent experiments .",
    "this includes the liquid - like breakup of highly collimated jets that rise up vertically after a heavy object impacts fine , loose granular material @xcite and the clustering inside thin granular sheets that form after a dense granular stream hits an obstacle @xcite . as in the granular streams , heterogeneities become visible while the jets or sheets expand after a brief stage of intense collisional interactions .",
    "inelasticity was suspected as the source , but our findings show instead that the observed dynamic structure formation is indeed the vestige of residual attractive interactions .",
    "here we describe the technical aspects of the simulations in more detail .",
    "three - dimensional molecular dynamics simulations of both hopper and stream are performed using itasca pfc3d software .",
    "the system consists of a cylindrical hopper ( diameter @xmath145 ) with a circular aperture ( diameter @xmath6 ) at the center of its base .",
    "the hopper geometry is designed to produce constant flow with the smallest number of grains necessary @xcite . maintaining @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and a fill height @xmath148 insures particle flow that is insensitive to the addition of further grains . to establish the proper fill height ,",
    "the simulations maintain @xmath149 particles inside the hopper .",
    "values for the simulation parameters used are given in the table below .",
    "for @xmath150 and @xmath149 the first value listed refers to the streams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : clusters ] and the second to the images and data shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : aspect]-[fig : model ] . to initiate a simulation ,",
    "grains are rained into the hopper and allowed to settle under gravity into a granular bed of height @xmath151 before the aperture is opened ( incidentally , we believe that the systematic deviations in the @xmath83 , @xmath152  nn ,  @xmath153  nn streams may have their source in insufficient system initialization ) .",
    "once the flow starts , grains are added to the top of the bed to keep @xmath149 and therefore @xmath154 constant on average .",
    "the average particle velocities at the aperture produced by the simulations closely matched those found in experiments @xcite with similar geometries ( e.g. , @xmath155",
    "10cm / s for @xmath156200  @xmath0 m and @xmath1573  mm ) .",
    "the repulsive force between grains is modeled using a linear spring - dashpot with both normal and tangential damping as well as static friction , following @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the normal contact force is given by @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is the overlap between the grains @xmath160 and @xmath161 , @xmath162 the normal stiffness , @xmath163 is the damping constant for normal motion , @xmath164 is the reduced mass , and @xmath165 is the grain mass ( @xmath172.5  kg / m@xmath18 ) . the tangential contact force @xmath166 has the same functional dependence , but with tangential displacement @xmath167 , tangential stiffness @xmath168 and damping constant @xmath169 in place of @xmath170 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "friction is incorporated by truncating @xmath166 in order to satisfy the yield criterion @xmath171 .",
    "head - on collisional energy loss was parameterized by a coefficient of restitution @xmath172 , where @xmath173 and @xmath174 are the normal components of the colliding grains relative velocities immediately before and after the collision .",
    "this linear - dashpot model leads to a restitution coefficient @xmath175}$ ] , independent of impact velocity ( note that we define @xmath176 as a ` bare ' restitution coefficient that does not take into account cohesion ) .",
    "similarly , a coefficient of restitution for the tangential motion @xmath177 , with @xmath168 and @xmath169 replacing @xmath162 and @xmath163 , captures losses due to sliding . for the simulations presented here ,",
    "we set @xmath178 and @xmath179 so that there is the same coefficient of restitution @xmath180 for normal and tangential motion .",
    "the elasticity is varied by changing only the damping constants @xmath163 and @xmath169 while keeping @xmath162 , @xmath168 , and @xmath181 constant .",
    "cohesion is included by adding a force of constant magnitude @xmath11 that turns on after two grains have collided and drops to zero outside a thin shell of thickness of @xmath100 around each grain .",
    "physically , this model represents a force that turns off over a lengthscale that is much smaller than the particle size , e.g. van der waals interactions or the rupture of a liquid bridge @xcite . as a result",
    ", this is a hysteretic interaction and completely separating two grains initially touching costs a cohesive energy @xmath182 .",
    "we note that our model for cohesion between grains does not capture more subtle , higher order effects caused by , for example , a velocity dependent coefficient of restitution [ see for example @xcite ] .",
    "droplet widths and heights are calculated for networks with 30 or more particles in streams with @xmath183  nn . effects of stream initialization ( e.g. plug formation ) are avoided by excluding the 1000 droplets farthest from the aperture . to ensure droplets",

    "the droplet width is taken to be the mean radial extent from the principle axis of each droplet averaged over all angles ( partitioned into @xmath184 bins ) .    in our system , the heterogeneous nature of the stream made it difficult to define a coarse grained velocity field .",
