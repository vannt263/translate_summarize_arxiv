    "active liquid crystals are nonequilibrium fluids composed of internally driven elongated units . examples of active systems that can exhibit liquid crystalline order include mixtures of cytoskeletal filaments and associated motor proteins , bacterial suspensions , the cell cytoskeleton and even non - living analogues , such as monolayers of vibrated granular rods @xcite .",
    "the key feature that distinguishes active liquid crystals from their well - studied passive counterparts is that they are maintained out of equilibrium not by an external force applied at the system s boundary , such as an imposed shear , but by an energy input on each individual unit .",
    "the energy fed into the system at the microscopic scale is then transformed into organized motion at the large scale .",
    "this type of `` reverse energy cascade '' is the hallmark of active systems . in active liquid crystals the large scale self - organized flows resulting from activity further couple to orientational order , yielding a very rich behavior .",
    "novel effects that have been predicted theoretically or observed in simulations and experiments include spontaneous laminar flow @xcite , large density fluctuations @xcite , unusual rheological properties @xcite , excitability @xcite and low reynolds number `` turbulence '' @xcite .",
    "ordered liquid crystalline phases of active matter can be classified according to their symmetry and to the nature of the forces that the active units exert on the environment .",
    "active particles are often elongated objects with a head and a tail , hence intrinsically polar , such as bacteria or birds",
    ". such systems can order in states with ferromagnetic ( polar ) order , where all units are on average aligned in a fixed direction .",
    "in this case the ordered state is also a macroscopically moving state .",
    "polar active particles can also order in states with nematic or apolar order , where the particles are aligned along the same axis , but with random head / tail orientation . in this case",
    "the ordered state has apolar or nematic symmetry : if the direction of mean order is denoted by a unit vector @xmath0 then the ordered state is invariant under @xmath1 and has zero mean velocity .",
    "some active units are intrinsically apolar , such as vibrated rods  @xcite , melanocytes  @xcite and some fibroblasts  @xcite , and order in states with nematic symmetry .",
    "in addition to the distinction based on symmetry of the ordered state , active systems can be further classified by the type of stresses or flows they impose on the surrounding medium . these can be contractile , as in actomyosin networks or in migrating cell layers , or extensile , as in suspensions of microtubule bundles or in most bacteria  @xcite . in the context of swimming microorganisms or artificial swimmers , units that exert extensile forces on the surrounding fluid",
    "are known as pushers , while those that exert contractile forces are known as pullers .",
    "most bacteria are pushers , while the alga chlamydomonas is an example of a puller .",
    "the extensile or contractile nature of active stresses affects the stability of ordered states  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the rich dynamics of active liquid crystals with nematic symmetry .",
    "we consider both extensile  @xcite and contractile  @xcite systems .",
    "previous work has highlighted the rich dynamics that arises in active nematics from the interplay of activity , orientational order and flow  @xcite .",
    "more recently it was suggested that topological defects play an important role in mediating and driving turbulent - like active flows  @xcite .",
    "topological defects are inhomogeneous configurations of the order field that provide a distinctive signature of liquid crystalline order and have been extensively studied in passive nematics . for passive nematics",
    ", defects may be generated through boundary conditions , externally applied fields , or via sufficiently rapid quenches from the disordered to the ordered state  @xcite .",
    "when the constraints are removed , or the system is given time to equilibrate , the defects ultimately annihilate and the system reaches a homogeneous ordered state that minimizes the free energy .",
    "the structure of the topological defects is intimately related to the broken symmetry of the ordered state and effectively provides a  fingerprint \" of such a symmetry .",
    "when the ordered state has ferromagnetic ( polar ) symmetry , the lowest energy defect configurations are the charge @xmath2 vortices and asters ( monopoles ) , while in states with nematic symmetry charge @xmath3 defects , known as disclinations , are possible  @xcite and have the lowest energy .",
    "the structure of the topological defects therefore provides an important tool for classifying the broken symmetry of liquid crystalline states .    in active liquid crystals , in contrast to passive ones",
    ", defect configurations can occur spontaneously in the bulk and be continuously regenerated by the local energy input , as demonstrated in experiments  @xcite . while the aster and vortex defects that occur in polar active systems  @xcite have been studied for some time @xcite , the properties of defects in active nematics have only recently become the focus of experimental and theoretical attention .",
    "disclinations have been identified in monolayers of vibrated granular rods  @xcite , in active nematic gels assembled _ in vitro _ from microtubules and kinesins  @xcite , in dense cell monolayers  @xcite , and in living liquid crystals obtained by injecting bacteria in chromonic liquid crystals  @xcite . in bulk suspensions of microtubule bundles the defects drive spontaneous flows  @xcite . when confined at an oil / water interface , furthermore",
    ", the same suspensions form a two - dimensional active nematic film , with self - sustained flows resembling cytoplasmic streaming and the continuous creation and annihilation of defect pairs @xcite .",
    "recent work by us  @xcite and others  @xcite has begun to systematically examine the effect of activity on the dynamics of disclinations in a nematic liquid crystalline film .",
    "we demonstrated that @xmath4 disclinations in active liquid crystals behave like self - propelled particles with an active speed proportional to activity .",
    "the direction of active motion is controlled by the extensile or contractile nature of the active stresses . for certain relative orientations of pairs of defects of opposite strength",
    "this self propulsion can overcome the equilibrium repulsive interaction among pairs of opposite - sign defects , allowing for dynamical states with an average sustained concentration of defect - antidefect pairs .",
    "in related work , thampi _",
    "et al_.  @xcite suggested that the mean distance between defects in these turbulent states may be strongly correlated with the correlation length of fluctuations in the flow velocity , and only weakly dependent on activity . in the rest of this paper",
    "we first review the hydrodynamic description of active nematics and the instabilities of the homogeneous ordered state . in section [ sec : proliferation ]",
    "we present the results of a systematic numerical study of the various flow regimes induced by activity .",
    "each regime is characterized in terms of flow patterns and defect proliferation .",
    "the chaotic regime exhibits a steady number of defects that persist in time .",
    "this is made possible by active flows that drive directed motion of the comet - like @xmath4 defects , generating , for certain relative orientations of two opposite sign defects , an effective repulsive interaction between the pair .",
    "the mechanisms for this active defect dynamics are analyzed in sections [ sec : isolated ] and [ sec : annihilation ] , where we discuss individual defect dynamics and pair annihilation in active nematics , respectively .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion highlighting open questions .",
    "we consider a uniaxial active nematic liquid crystal in two dimensions .",
    "the two - dimensional limit is appropriate to describe the experiments by sanchez _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , where the microtubule bundles confined to a water - oil interface form an effectively two - dimensional dense nematic suspension , but also of considerable interest in its own right .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations of active nematic liquid crystals have been derived by coarse - graining a semi - microscopic model of cytoskeletal filaments crosslinked by clusters of motor proteins  @xcite .",
    "they can also simply be obtained from the hydrodynamic equations of passive systems by the addition of nonequilibrium stresses and currents due to activity @xcite .",
    "we consider here an incompressible suspension where the total density @xmath5 of active bundles and solvent is constant .",
    "the equations are formulated in terms of the concentration @xmath6 of active units , the flow velocity @xmath7 of the suspension and the nematic tensor order parameter @xmath8 , with @xmath0 the director field .",
    "the alignment tensor @xmath9 is traceless and symmetric , and hence has only two independent components in two dimensions .",

    "we are interested here in a system where the transition is driven by the concentration of nematogens , as is the case for a fluid of hard rods of length @xmath30 which exhibits an isotropic - nematic ( in ) transition at a concentration @xmath31 in two dimensions . noting that @xmath24 and @xmath25 have dimensions of energy density ( in two dimensions ) , we choose @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath34 in a homogeneous state of density @xmath35 , so that @xmath36 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 the ratio @xmath40 defines a length scale that corresponds to the equilibrium correlation length of order parameter fluctuations and diverges at the continuous in transition  @xcite .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to mean values of concentration well above @xmath41 , where this equilibrium correlation length is microscopic and is of the order of the size @xmath30 of the nematogens , which will be used as our unit of length in the numerical simulation . finally , the stress tensor @xmath42 is the sum of the elastic stress due to nematic elasticity , @xmath43 where for simplicity we have neglected the eriksen stress , and an active contribution , given by  @xcite @xmath44 which describes stresses exerted by the active particles .",
    "the sign of @xmath45 depends on whether the active particles generate contractile or extensile stresses , with @xmath46 for the contractile case and @xmath47 for extensile systems .",
    "activity yields also a curvature - induced current given by the last term on the right hand side of eq .  , @xmath48 , that drives active units from regions populated by fast moving particles to regions of slow moving particles .",
    "the @xmath49 dependence of the active stress and current is appropriate for systems where activity arises from pair interactions among the filaments via crosslinking motor proteins .",
    "the active parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 will be treated here as purely phenomenological . in microscopic models",

    "the unstable regions are bounded by the critical activity given in eq .  .",
    "flow tumbling extensile nematic with @xmath61 are unstable to bend when active stresses are extensile ( @xmath62 ) and to splay when active stresses are contractile ( @xmath63 ) .",

    "note that the sign of @xmath67 depends both on the sign of the fraction and the sign of the term @xmath68 in the denominator .",

    "<S> topological defects are distinctive signatures of liquid crystals . they profoundly affect the viscoelastic behavior of the fluid by constraining the orientational structure in a way that inevitably requires global changes not achievable with any set of local deformations . in active nematic liquid crystals topological defects not only dictate the global structure of the director , but also act as local sources of motion , behaving as self - propelled particles . </S>",
    "<S> in this article we present a detailed analytical and numerical study of the mechanics of topological defects in active nematic liquid crystals . </S>"
