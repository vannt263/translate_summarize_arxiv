    "the paper is concerned with the spectral and computational analysis of effective preconditioners for linear systems arising from finite element approximations to the elliptic convection - diffusion problem @xmath0 with @xmath1 domain of @xmath2 .",
    "we consider a model setting in which the structured finite element partition is made by equi - lateral triangles .",
    "the interest of such a partition relies on the observation that automatic grid generators tend to construct equi - lateral triangles when the mesh is fine enough .",
    "the analysis is performed having in mind two popular preconditioned krylov methods .",
    "more precisely , we analyze the performances of the preconditioned conjugate gradient ( pcg ) method in the case of the diffusion problem and of the preconditioned generalized minimal residual ( pgmres ) in the case of the convection - diffusion problem .",
    "we define the preconditioner as a combination of a basic ( projected ) toeplitz matrix times diagonal structures .",
    "the diagonal part takes into account the variable coefficients in the operator of ( [ eq : modello ] ) , and especially the diffusion coefficient @xmath3 , while the ( projected ) toeplitz part derives from a special approximation of ( [ eq : modello ] ) when setting the diffusion coefficient to @xmath4 and the convective velocity field to @xmath5 . under such assumptions ,",
    "if the problem is coercive , and the diffusive and convective coefficients are regular enough , then the proposed preconditioned matrix sequences have a strong clustering at unity , the preconditioning matrix sequence and the original matrix sequence are spectrally equivalent , and the eigenvector matrices have a mild conditioning .",
    "the obtained results allow to show the optimality of the related preconditioned krylov methods .",
    "it is important to stress that interest of such a study relies on the observation that automatic grid generators tend to construct equi - lateral triangles when the mesh is fine enough .",
    "numerical tests , both on the model setting and in the non - structured case , show the effectiveness of the proposal and the correctness of the theoretical findings .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sez : fem ]",
    "we report a brief description of the fe approximation of convection - diffusion equations and the preconditioner definition .",
    "section [ sez : clustering ] is devoted to the spectral analysis of the underlying preconditioned matrix sequences , in the case of structured uniform meshes . in section [ sez : numerical_tests ] , after a preliminary discussion on complexity issues , selected numerical tests illustrate the convergence properties stated in the former section and their extension under weakened assumption or in the case of unstructured meshes . a final section [ sez : conclusions ] deals with perspectives and future works .",
    "problem ( [ eq : modello ] ) can be stated in variational form as follows : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the space of square integrable functions , with square integrable weak derivatives vanishing on @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that @xmath1 is a polygonal domain and we make the following hypotheses on the coefficients : @xmath9 the previous assumptions guarantee existence and uniqueness for problem ( [ eq : formulazione_variazionale ] ) and hence the existence and uniqueness of the ( weak ) solution for problem ( [ eq : modello ] ) .    for the sake of simplicity , we restrict ourselves to linear finite element approximation of problem ( [ eq : formulazione_variazionale ] ) . to this end , let @xmath10 be a usual finite element partition of @xmath11 into triangles , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the space of linear finite elements , i.e. @xmath15 the finite element approximation of problem ( [ eq : formulazione_variazionale ] ) reads : @xmath16 for each internal node @xmath17 of the mesh @xmath18 , let @xmath19 be such that @xmath20 , and @xmath21 if @xmath22 .",
    "then , the collection of all @xmath23 s is a base for @xmath24",
    ". we will denote by @xmath25 the number of the internal nodes of @xmath18 , which corresponds to the dimension of @xmath24 .",
    "then , we write @xmath26 as @xmath27 and the variational equation ( [ eq : formulazione_variazionale_fe ] ) becomes an algebraic linear system : @xmath28 according to these notations and definitions , the algebraic equations in ( [ eq : modello_discreto ] ) can be rewritten in matrix form as the linear system @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 represent the approximation of the diffusive term and approximation of the convective term , respectively .",
    "more precisely , we have @xmath32 where suitable quadrature formula are considered in the case of non constant coefficient functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "as well known , the main drawback in the linear system resolution is due to the asymptotical ill - conditioning ( i.e. very large for large dimensions ) , so that preconditioning is highly recommended .",
    "hereafter , we refer to a preconditioning strategy previously analyzed in the case of fd / fe approximations of the diffusion problem @xcite and recently applied to fd / fe approximations @xcite of ( [ eq : modello ] ) with respect to the preconditioned hermitian and skew - hermitian splitting ( phss ) method @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the preconditioning matrix sequence @xmath35 is defined as @xmath36 where @xmath37 , i.e. , the suitable scaled main diagonal of @xmath38 and clearly @xmath38 equals @xmath30 .",
    "the computational aspects of this preconditioning strategy with respect to krylov methods will be discussed later in section [ sez : complexity_issues ] . here , preliminarily we want to stress as the preconditioner is tuned only with respect to the diffusion matrix @xmath30 : in other words , we are implicity assuming that the convection phenomenon is not dominant , and no stabilization is required in order to avoid spurious oscillations into the solution .",
    "moreover , the spectral analysis is performed in the non - hermitian case by referring to the hermitian and skew - hermitian ( hss ) decomposition of @xmath39 ( that can be performed on any single elementary matrix related to @xmath18 by considering the standard assembling procedure ) .    according to the definition",
    ", the hss decomposition is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 since by definition , the diffusion term @xmath30 is a hermitian matrix and does not contribute to the skew - hermitian part of @xmath39 .",
    "notice also that @xmath42 if @xmath43 .",
    "more in general , the matrix @xmath44 is symmetric and positive definite whenever @xmath45 . indeed , without the condition @xmath46",
    ", the matrix @xmath47 does not have a definite sign in general : in fact , a specific analysis of the involved constants is required in order to guarantee the nonnegativity of the term @xmath47 . moreover",
    ", the lemma below allows to obtain further information regarding such a spectral assumption , where @xmath48 indicate both the usual vector norms and the induced matrix norms .    _",
    "@xcite _ [ lemma : normae ] let @xmath49 be the matrix sequence defined according to _ ( [ eq : def_e_nb])_. under the assumptions in _ ( [ eq : ipotesi_coefficienti ] ) _ , then we find @xmath50 with @xmath51 absolute positive constant only depending on @xmath52 and @xmath1 .",
    "the claim holds both in the case in which the matrix elements in _ ( [ eq : def_psi ] ) _ are evaluated exactly and whenever a quadrature formula with error @xmath53 is considered for approximating the involved integrals .",
    "hereafter , we will denote by @xmath54 , @xmath55 , the matrix sequence associated to a family of meshes @xmath56 , with decreasing finesse parameter @xmath57 .",
    "as customary , the whole preconditioning analysis will refer to a matrix sequence instead to a single matrix , since the goal is to quantify the difficulty of the linear system resolution in relation to the accuracy of the chosen approximation scheme .",
    "the aim of this section is to analyze the spectral properties of the preconditioned matrix sequences @xmath58 in the case of some special domains @xmath1 partitioned with structured uniform meshes , so that spectral tools derived from toeplitz theory @xcite can be successfully applied .",
    "the applicative interest of the considered type of domains will be motivated in the short .",
    "indeed , let @xmath59 be a @xmath60variate lebesgue integrable function defined over @xmath61 ^ 2 $ ] . by referring to the fourier coefficients of this function @xmath59 , called generating function ,",
    "@xmath62 with @xmath63 , one can build the sequence of toeplitz matrices @xmath64 .",
    "the matrix @xmath65 is said to be the toeplitz matrix of order @xmath66 , @xmath67 , generated by @xmath59 .",
    "now , the spectral properties of the matrix sequence @xmath64 are completely understood and characterized in terms of the underlying generating functions ( see , e.g. , @xcite for more details ) . in the following , with respect to the latter claim",
    ", we will refer to the notion of equivalent generating functions .",
    "in such a respect , we claim that two nonnegative function @xmath59 and @xmath68 defined over a domain @xmath69 are equivalent if and only if @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 means that there exists a pure positive constant @xmath73 such that @xmath74 almost everywhere on @xmath69 .",
    "+ ( a ) ( b )    the main motivation of this paper lies in the analysis of the template case reported in figure [ fig : esagono_esagoni].a , where we consider a partition into equilateral triangles .",
    "it is self - evident that such a problem represents just an academic example .",
    "however , it is a fact that a professional mesh generator will locally produce a partitioning , which is `` asymptotically '' similar to the one reported in the figure .    our goal is to prove the pcg optimality with respect to the diffusion problem approximation , i.e. , the number of iterations for reaching the solution , within a fixed accuracy , can be bounded from above by a constant independent of the dimension @xmath55 .",
    "some additional results about pgmres convergence properties in the case of the convection - diffusion problem approximation are also reported , both in the case of the hexagonal domain @xmath1 with a structured uniform mesh as in figure [ fig : esagono_esagoni].a and in the case @xmath75 with a structured uniform mesh as in figure [ fig : esagono_esagoni].b , so extending previous results proved in @xcite with respect to the phss method @xcite .",
    "the spectral analysis makes reference to the following definition .    _",
    "@xcite _ [ def : cluster ] let @xmath76 be a sequence of hermitian matrices of increasing dimensions @xmath77 .",
    "the sequence @xmath76 is clustered at @xmath78 in the eigenvalue sense if for any @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "the sequence @xmath76 is properly ( or strongly ) clustered at @xmath78 if for any @xmath81 the number of the eigenvalues of @xmath82 not belonging to @xmath83 can be bounded by a pure constant eventually depending on @xmath84 , but not on @xmath77 . in the case of non - hermitian matrices ,",
    "the same definition can be extended by considering the complex disk @xmath85 , instead of the interval @xmath83 .",
    "we start by considering the simpler diffusion problem , i.e. , the analysis concerns the hermitian matrix sequences @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "due to the very special choice of the domain @xmath1 , the matrices @xmath87 arising in the case @xmath88 with structured meshes as in figure [ fig : esagono_esagoni].a result to be a proper projection of toeplitz matrices generated by the function @xmath89 , @xmath90 ^ 2 $ ] , related to a bigger parallelogram shaped domain @xmath91 containing @xmath1 ( see figure [ fig : esagono_esagoni_parallelogrammi ] ) , i.e. , @xmath92 , with @xmath93 number of the internal nodes . here ,",
    "@xmath94 , @xmath95 is a proper projection matrix simply cutting those rows ( columns ) referring to nodes belonging to @xmath91 , but not to @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the matrix is full rank , i.e. , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "in the same way , we can also consider the toeplitz matrix with the same generating function arising when considering a smaller parallelogram shaped domain @xmath98 contained in @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath99 , with @xmath100 , @xmath101 proper projection matrix and such that @xmath102 , and @xmath103 .",
    "these embedding arguments allow to bound , according to the min - max principle ( see @xcite for more details on the use of this proof technique ) , the minimal eigenvalue of the matrices @xmath104 as follows @xmath105    a first technical step in our spectral analysis concerns relationships between this generating function @xmath106 and the more classical generating function @xmath107 arising in the case of fe approximations on a square @xmath75 with friedrichs - keller meshes ( see figure [ fig : esagono_esagoni].b ) , or standard fd discretizations .",
    "it can be easily observed that these two function are equivalent , in the sense of the previously reported definition , since we have @xmath108 ^ 2.\\ ] ] thus , because @xmath109 is a matrix - valued linear positive operator ( lpo ) for every @xmath77 @xcite , the toeplitz matrix sequences generated by this equivalent functions result to be spectrally equivalent , i.e. , for any @xmath77 @xmath110 furthermore , due to the strict positivity of every @xmath109 ( see @xcite for the precise definition ) , since @xmath111 is not identically zero , we have that @xmath112 is positive definite , and since @xmath113 is not identically zero , we find that @xmath114 is also positive definite . here , we are referring to the standard ordering relation between hermitian matrices , i.e. , the notation @xmath115 , with @xmath116 and @xmath117 hermitian matrices , means that @xmath118 is nonnegative definite .",
    "an interesting remark pertains to the fact that the function @xmath106 is the most natural one from the fe point of view , since no contribution are lost owing to the gradient orthogonality as instead in the case related to @xmath59 ; nevertheless its relationships with the function @xmath59 can be fully exploited in performing the spectral analysis .",
    "more precisely , from ( [ eq : lmin_proiezione ] ) and ( [ eq : rel_toeplitz ] ) and taking into account ( see e.g. @xcite ) that @xmath119 we deduce @xmath120 following the very same reasoning , we also find that @xmath121 since , by the embedding argument , both @xmath93 and @xmath122 are asymptotic to @xmath77 , it follows that @xmath123 . finally ,",
    "following the same analysis for the maximal eigenvalue , we find @xmath124 where , by @xcite , we know that @xmath125 and hence the spectral condition number of @xmath104 grows as @xmath126 i.e. @xmath127 where the constant hidden in the previous relation is mild and can be easily estimated .",
    "it is worth stressing that the same matrix @xmath128 can also be considered in a more general setting .",
    "in fact , the matrix sequence @xmath86 can also be defined as @xmath129 , since again each internal node in @xmath1 is a vertex of the same constant number of triangles .",
    "therefore , by referring to projection arguments , the spectral analysis can be equivalently performed both on the matrix sequence @xmath86 and @xmath130 .",
    "no matter about this choice , we make use of a second technical step , which is based on standard taylor s expansions .",

    "+ -1.0 cm    in the cases at hand , the validity of this claim is just a direct check : the key point relies in the symmetry properties induced by the structured uniform nature of the considered meshes , both in the case of @xmath1 and @xmath91 .",

    "more precisely , the second columns in table [ tab : it - es123esagono_triangoliequilateri_m5 ] report the number of iterations required to achieve the convergence for increasing values of the coefficient matrix size @xmath55 when considering the fe approximation with structured uniform meshes as in figure [ fig : esagono_esagoni ] and with template function @xmath197 , @xmath198^t$].the subsequent meshes are obtained by means of a progressive refinement procedure , consisting in adding new nodes corresponding to the middle point of each edge .",
    "the numerical experiments plainly confirm the previous theoretical analysis in section [ sez : clustering ] : the convergence behavior does not depend on the coefficient matrix dimension @xmath55 .    as anticipated , despite the lack of corresponding theoretical results , we want to test the convergence behavior also in the case in which the regularity assumption on @xmath199 in theorems [ teo : clu+se_a_esagoni ] and [ teo : clua ] are not satisfied .",
    "the analysis is motivated by favorable known numerical results in the case of fd approximations ( see , for instance , @xcite ) or fe approximation with only the diffusion term @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we consider as template the @xmath200 function @xmath201 , the @xmath202 function @xmath203 , with @xmath204 or @xmath205 .    the number of required iterations is listed in the remaining columns in table [ tab : it - es123esagono_triangoliequilateri_m5 ] .",

    "according to this point of view , we have applied a spectral approximation of the matrix sequence @xmath208 in terms of product of low - cost matrix structures , i.e. , @xmath104 and @xmath209 , that carry the `` structural '' content of the variational problem and the specific `` informative '' content contained in the diffusion coefficient function @xmath210 , respectively .",
    "however , the matrix @xmath104 can be still not easy to handle .",
    "therefore , we go beyond in such idea by defining a preconditioner @xmath211 in which the matrix @xmath104 related to the unstructured mesh is replaced by a suitable projection of the toeplitz matrix @xmath212 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 ^ 2 $ ] ( see section [ sez : diffusion_equation ] ) .",
    "the numerical results are reported in table [ tab : it_perturbed_mesh ] . as expected ,",
    "the number of iterations is a constant with respect to the dimension when the preconditioner @xmath213 is applied .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath77 large enough , the same seems to be true also for the preconditioner @xmath211 .",
