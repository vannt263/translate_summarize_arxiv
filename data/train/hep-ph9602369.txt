    "one of the most fundamental ones refers to the masses and properties of neutrinos .",
    "apart from being a theoretical puzzle , in the sense that there is no principle that dictates that neutrinos are massless , as postulated in the standard model , nonzero masses may in fact be required in order to account for the data on solar and atmospheric neutrinos , as well as the dark matter in the universe .",
    "the implications of detecting nonzero neutrino masses could be very far reaching for the understanding of fundamental issues in particle physics , astrophysics , as well as the large scale structure of our universe .",
    "one interesting aspect of most extensions of the standard model where neutrino have non - vanishing masses is that they may affect the physics of the electroweak sector in a very remarkable way , which can be experimentally tested .",
    "some of the ways to probe the corresponding physics at accelerator as well as underground experiments will be described .",

    "unlike the latter , the neutrino - less process violates lepton number and its existence would indicate the majorana nature of neutrinos .",

    "one method sensitive to large masses is to search for distortions in the energy spectra of leptons coming from @xmath36 weak decays such as @xmath37 , @xmath38 , as well as kinks in nuclear @xmath39 decays .",

    ".2 cm    by combining the observations of cosmic background temperature anisotropies on large scales performed by the cobe satellite @xcite with cluster - cluster correlation data e.g. from iras @xcite one finds that it is not possible to fit well the data on all scales within the framework of the popular cold dark matter ( cdm ) model .",
    "indeed , the best fit is obtained for a mixture , otherwise ad hoc , consisting of about 70% cdm with about 25 % _ hot dark matter _ ( hdm ) and a small amount in baryons @xcite . the best way to make up for",
    "the hot dark matter component is through a massive neutrino in the few ev mass range .",
    "it has been argued that this could be the tau neutrino , in which case one might expect the existence of @xmath40 or @xmath40 oscillations .",
    "searches for these oscillations are now underway at cern , with a similar proposal also at fermilab @xcite .",

    "for the gallium result we have taken the average of the gallex @xcite and the sage measurements @xcite .    comparing the data of gallium experiments with the kamiokande data one sees the need for a reduction of the @xmath42be flux relative to standard solar model @xcite expectations .",
    "inclusion of the homestake data only sharpens the discrepancy , suggesting that the solar problem is indeed a real problem .",
    "the totality of the data strongly suggests that the simplest astrophysical solutions are ruled out , and that new physics is needed @xcite .",
    "the most attractive possibility is to assume the existence of conversions involving very small masses . in the framework of the msw effect @xcite",

    "the regions inside the other curves correspond to the case where matter density fluctuations are assumed .",

    "the large mixing area is less stable , with a tendency to shift towards smaller @xmath43 and @xmath52 values .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath42be neutrinos are the solar neutrino spectrum component which is most affected by the matter noise .",

    "although the predicted absolute fluxes of produced by cosmic - ray interactions in the atmosphere are uncertain at the 20% level , their ratios are expected to be accurate to within 5% .",
