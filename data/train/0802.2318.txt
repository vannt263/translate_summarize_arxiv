    "one of the most important ingredients is the set of equation of state ( eos ) that contains necessary physical quantities .",
    "it is to be noted that one must cover a wide range of temperature , density and composition in a consistent manner and theoretical framework .    until now",
    ", the two sets of eos ( lattimer - swesty eos  @xcite and shen eos  @xcite ) have been widely used and applied to numerical simulations of core - collapse supernovae  @xcite and black hole formations  @xcite .",
    "the lattimer - swesty eos is based on a compressible liquid - drop model , whose mass and mean field potential are motivated by non - relativistic zero - range skyrme type interactions .",
    "the shen eos is based on a relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model , whose interactions are determined by fitting the binding energies and nuclear radii of stable as well as unstable nuclei  @xcite .",
    "coexistence of nuclei and uniform matter is included in the thomas - fermi approximation in the wigner - seitz cell , and the alpha particles are assumed to follow the statistical distribution with excluded volume effects .",
    "the constituents in these eoss are neutrons , protons , alpha - particles and nuclei , restricting the framework within the non - strange baryons .",
    "these degrees of freedom may be enough to simulate the early stage of hydrodynamical evolution of supernova explosions .",
    "however , in order to clarify the long - time evolution from core collapse  @xcite to proto - neutron star cooling  @xcite , black hole formation  @xcite , neutron star mergers and gamma ray bursts that may involve higher density / temperature , it would be necessary to include other particle degrees of freedom .",
    "especially , hyperons ( baryons containing strange quarks ) are commonly believed to appear in neutron star core and to modify the neutron star profile  @xcite .",
    "while there are several works which include the hyperons in the proto - neutron star cooling  @xcite , there has been no study on the dynamics of core - collapse supernovae adopting the eos with hyperons .",
    "this is partially because eos table of supernova matter including hyperons has not been available in public .",
    "in addition , the determination of the interaction for hyperons has been difficult having large uncertainties so far .",
    "recently , developments in hypernuclear physics have narrowed down the allowed range of hyperon potential depth in nuclear matter .",
    "the potential depth of @xmath14 has been well known to be around @xmath15 from bound state spectroscopy . for @xmath1 baryons ,",
    "it was considered to feel similar potential to @xmath14 , because it contains the same number of light @xmath16 quarks . from the recently observed quasi - free @xmath1 production spectra  @xcite",
    ", it is now believed that @xmath1 baryons would feel repulsive potential in nuclear matter ; @xmath4  @xcite , also for @xmath2 baryons , the analyses of the twin hypernuclear formation  @xcite and the @xmath2 production spectra  @xcite , suggest the potential depth of around @xmath17 .",
    "these @xmath1 and @xmath2 hyperons are particularly important in neutron stars , since nuclear matter can take a large energy gain from neutron fermi energy and symmetry energy by replacing , for example , two neutrons with a proton and a negatively charged hyperon ( @xmath18 or @xmath19 )",
    ". the updates on the interactions of hyperons may have impact on supernova dynamics and thermal evolution of proto - neutron stars .    in this paper",
    ", we present new sets of eos of dense matter with hyperons , abbreviated as eos@xmath20 , under the current understanding of interaction .",
    "we provide the data table covering a wide range of temperature ( @xmath21 ) , density ( @xmath22 ) , and charge - to - baryon number ratio in hadronic part ( @xmath23 ) , which enables one to apply to supernova simulations .",
    "our framework is based on the rmf theory with the parameter set tm1  @xcite , which was used to derive the eos table by shen et al .",
    "@xcite , and is extended to include hyperons by considering the flavor su(3 ) lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "therefore , our eos table is smoothly connected with shen eos and can be used easily as an extension of shen eos table in numerical simulations .",
    "it is well known that the rmf predicts large values of incompressibility ( @xmath24 ) and symmetry energy , and these are sometimes considered to cause problems in applying to dense matter eos , since they lead to too high maximum mass of neutron stars without hyperons and may be unfavorable to core - collapse explosions .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath25 and symmetry energy values are not yet well determined separately in a model independent manner .",
    "analyses of collective flow data at ags energies suggest @xmath26  @xcite , and collective flows at sps energies are shown to be more sensitive to the mean field of resonance hadrons rather than to the cold matter eos  @xcite . for symmetry energy ,",
    "it is possible to describe binding energies , proton - neutron radius differences and isovector giant monopole resonances simultaneously by incorporating density dependent coupling ( dd - me1 ) in rmf and relativistic rpa  @xcite with a larger value of symmetry energy than that in non - relativistic models .",
    "note that the interaction of rmf - tm1 is constrained by the nuclear masses , radii , neutron skins and excitations  @xcite .",
    "the large value of @xmath25 leads to a large neutron star mass ( stiff eos ) , which seems not preferable for explosion . on the other hand",
    ", the large symmetry energy is known to be preferable for explosion , having less free proton fraction and smaller electron captures .",
    "these two effects are competing each other in the sophisticated numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "we note also that the rmf fulfills automatically the causality ( the sound velocity should not exceed the light velocity ) whereas the non - relativistic frameworks breaks down at high densities appearing in the simulations .",
    "thus at present we do not find problems in applying rmf eos to dense matter compared to non - relativistic models .",

    "recent developments in hypernuclear physics suggest the following potentials for @xmath1  @xcite and @xmath2 baryons  @xcite @xmath121 these potentials are consistent with those in the quark - cluster model for @xmath56 interaction  @xcite and a chiral model prediction  @xcite . in this paper , we have modified @xmath66 and @xmath67 to explain these potentials , while other coupling constants are unchanged from those in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 potential in nuclear matter still has ambiguities .",
    "recent theoretical analysis  @xcite has shown that the shape and absolute values of quasi - free @xmath1 production spectra are well explained in a woods - saxon potential with @xmath122 .",
    "on the other hand , a few mev attractive pocket is known to be required to explain the energy shift of @xmath18 atom  @xcite , then the central repulsion would be stronger to cancel the effects of this pocket .",
    "other theoretical analyses  @xcite suggest that @xmath123 would be preferred in order to explain the shape or the absolute yield in @xmath1 production spectra . in any of these analyses ,",
    "@xmath1 potential should be repulsive or less attractive than that for @xmath14 , then the effects of @xmath1 hyperons are much smaller than those in the attractive case .",
    "it is to be noted that the ambiguities in @xmath124 do not affect the supernova eos very much as far as @xmath1 hyperon fraction is small .",
    "formation of finite nuclei at low densities is another important ingredient in supernova simulations . in the present eos ,",
    "effects of finite nuclear formation are included by using the shen eos  @xcite , in which formation of finite nuclei is included in the thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "effects from finite nuclei are evaluated by the difference of free energy and its derivatives in the shen eos from the eos of uniform nucleonic matter ( tm1 ) without hyperons at each @xmath125 .",
    "we have examined the properties of the eos with hyperons in neutron star matter ( @xmath126 , @xmath69-equilibrium ) and supernova matter .",
    "hyperon effects are significant in neutron stars as discussed already in the literature  @xcite .",
    "hyperons appear at around @xmath127 in cold matter under @xmath69-equilibrium and soften the eos .",
    "the maximum mass of neutron stars decreases from @xmath6 to @xmath128 and @xmath8 when hyperons are included with attractive and repulsive hyperon potentials , respectively . in prompt phase in supernova explosions ,",
    "on the other hand , hyperon effects are found to be small in a spherical , adiabatic collapse of a 15@xmath10 star by the hydrodynamics without neutrino transfer . in the case with @xmath129 as a typical example , hyperon fraction becomes meaningful ( @xmath130 ) at @xmath131 or @xmath132 . in the spherical and adiabatic core collapse calculation of a massive star with the 15@xmath10  @xcite",
    ", the maximum density and temperature are found to be @xmath133 , which do not reach the region of the above hyperon mixture region .",
    "it should be noted that this conclusion is model dependent .",
    "hyperons may appear more abundantly in more realistic calculations with neutrino transfer , which are in progress .",

    "we have examined the effects of free thermal pions  @xcite . in neutron star matter",

    "the eos softening from pions is moderate and limited in the density range @xmath136 without ( @xmath137-wave ) @xmath138 attraction , then the maximum mass of neutron stars ( @xmath105 ) is almost the same as that without pions . in supernova explosions , temperatures are not very high and pion contributions are small . at higher temperatures as in the case of black hole formation or high energy heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "the role of pions should be significant .",
    "there are several points to be improved for deeper understanding of supernova matter eos .",
    "first , it is necessary to examine the coupling constants of hyperons with hidden strangeness mesons , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which critically decide @xmath139 interaction . in this paper , we have adopted @xmath140 and @xmath141 in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the couplings are determined based on the su(6 ) relation and a conjecture on the hyperon potential depth in hyperon matter .",
    "an alternative way to determine these couplings would be to invoke various hypernuclear and hyperon atom data , such as the double @xmath14 hypernuclear binding energy in @xmath142  @xcite and atomic energy shifts in @xmath18 atom  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , tsubakihara et al . have determined the scalar couplings of @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath66 and @xmath145 , by using the double @xmath14 hypernuclear bond energy and the atomic energy shift of @xmath18 atom , while vector couplings are fixed from the @xmath111 relations . at present , available data are so scarce that we can not fix these couplings based on the data unambiguously , but future coming j - parc and fair facilities will provide much more data on @xmath139 interaction .",
    "next , it is desired to respect chiral symmetry in order to describe very dense matter , in which spontaneous broken chiral symmetry will be partially restored .",
    "a chiral symmetric rmf model  @xcite is recently developed based on a scalar meson self - energy derived in the strong coupling limit of lattice qcd , and it describes binding energies and radii of normal nuclei in a comparable precision to tm1 .",
    "an @xmath111 extended version of this chiral rmf is now being developed  @xcite .",
    "finally , distribution of finite nuclear species may be important at low densities  @xcite . at finite temperatures ,",
    "the entropy increase by the formation of various fragments will contribute to gain the free energy compared with the single heavy - nuclear configuration assumed in the thomas - fermi approach .",
    "it is not straightforward but challenging to include nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) distribution in a consistent way in the eos based on rmf .",
    "these challenging developments of hadronic and nuclear physics are important to understand the extreme conditions in compact objects and to clarify the mechanism of explosive phenomena in astrophysics .",

    "if the chemical equilibrium holds , the chemical potentials follows the relations , @xmath196 @xmath197 the latter relation comes from the fact that the net @xmath198-type lepton number is zero . because of positive values of @xmath199 , r.h.s of the chemical equilibrium is reduced .",
    "in addition , the appearance of muon requires the production of anti - neutrinos of @xmath198-type and leads to the negative value of @xmath200 .",
