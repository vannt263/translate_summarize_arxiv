    "complex networks have attracted growing attention because of their non - uniform connectivity patterns , which may give rise to node degree power laws and hubs , known to play an important role in defining several topological properties of the networks  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the fact that many complex networks include _ communities _ , i.e. sets of nodes which connect more intensely amongst one another than with the rest of the network , has become the focus of increasing attention ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , because of statistical fluctuations , even random networks  @xcite can be found to exhibit communities  @xcite .",
    "although we still lack a clear - cut definition of a community , the problem of identifying communities in complex networks continues to motivate interest from researchers because of the importance that those structures have for better understanding the general organization of such complex structures ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "another important feature of complex networks are the cycles of different lengths which underlie the connectivity of the several models of networks  @xcite .",
    "actually , the statistical distribution of cycles has been acknowledged as particularly important for defining not only the topology of the respective networks , but also the dynamics of systems running on such frameworks(e.g .",
    "the latter is a direct consequence of the fact that cycles , through feedback , form the scaffolding of memory in dynamical systems .",
    "generally , the density of cycles tends to increase as more edges are incorporated into a network , with longer cycles being observed earlier than shorter ones ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the density of cycles of different lengths can be used as an indicator of the connectivity between any subset of nodes . in other words ,",
    "the larger the number of shortest cycles among a subset of nodes , the more connected such nodes are to one another .",
    "longer cycles tend to grow , `` coiled up '' , alongside these shorter cycles , however , blurring the distinction between nodes based solely on short - cycle participation .",
    "we present methods to overcome this .",
    "the article starts by presenting the cycle finding algorithm and its application as the core of the community finding algorithm and proceeds by illustrating the application of such a methodology to community finding in a theoretical complex network model ( i.e. sznajd networks  @xcite ) and a real - world football network .",
    "for a graph @xmath0 , @xmath1 , we are interested in finding cycles of length 3,4 , or 5 containing some starting vertex @xmath2 . to describe these cycles we begin by decomposing g into shells @xmath3 about @xmath4 .",
    "we define shell @xmath3 to be the set of all vertices ( and edges between those vertices ) at a distance @xmath5 from the starting vertex @xmath4 .",
    "since we are only interested in cycles of length @xmath6 , we need only to keep shells @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "it is simple to describe all possible short cycles using these shell decompositions .",
    "for example , for every edge @xmath9 in @xmath7 about @xmath4 , there exists a 3-cycle ( triangle ) @xmath4@xmath5@xmath10@xmath4 .",
    "similarly , for every path of length 2 or 3 in @xmath7 , there exists a 4- or 5-cycle , respectively .",
    "another 4-cycle and two more 5-cycles exist involving both @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "in general , for a cycle of length @xmath11 , the number of such possible `` cases '' grows with @xmath12 .",
    "since it requires 2 edges to visit a shell , an @xmath12-cycle can visit at most @xmath13 shells , where @xmath14    if the farthest shell the cycle visits is @xmath15 , @xmath16 , there are at most @xmath17 remaining edges that must be distributed between and within the @xmath18 shells .",
    "the number of ways to distribute @xmath17 edges over @xmath10 shells is @xmath19 .",
    "however , it is possible for a cycle to `` zig - zag '' between shells , using more than the @xmath20 edges necessary to visit the @xmath10 shells .",
    "therefore , the total number of possible ways to distribute an @xmath12-cycle is at least :    @xmath21    with the outer sum accounting for all the possible shells the cycle can visit , the inner sum for all the optional pairs of edges that can lie between shells and the @xmath22 for the one possible cycle that visits the first shell only . here , @xmath5 is the number of pairs of edges between shells beyond the @xmath10 necessary to visit the @xmath10 shells .",
    "this calculation fails to take into account permutations of the _ ordering _ of edges between and within two adjacent shells .",
    "a simple upper bound is possible , however , as there are certainly no more than @xmath23 possible permutations over the whole network : @xmath24 with @xmath25",
    "for a graph @xmath26 , a cycle @xmath27 is a subset of the set of edges @xmath28",
    "containing a continuous path , where the first and last node of the path are the same  @xcite . permutations of cycles may be ignored since we will be working exclusively with sets of edges . throughout this work ,",
    "we limit ourselves to short cycles , typically those of length @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "these shorter cycles may provide the advantage of faster calculation times .",
    "community structure can be studied by comparing the edges covered by these cycles with the original graph .",
    "let @xmath31    starting from all vertices and limiting ourselves to only short @xmath10-cycles,[multiblock footnote omitted ] @xmath32    then , for a graph @xmath26 , we construct a graph @xmath33 where , @xmath34 is the graph @xmath26 containing only edges that do not participate in @xmath10-cycles .",
    "separate communities in @xmath26 will appear as disconnected components in @xmath33 .",
    "we interpret vertices with degree zero in @xmath33 as communities of size one .    in specifying @xmath33 , the question of what to choose for @xmath10 has been left open .",
    "for example , choosing just @xmath35 will correspond to deleting all edges from @xmath26 that participate in 3-cycles , generally not a useful result .",
    "one may consider @xmath10 to be a tunable parameter , used to get a desired result when applied to a specific network .",
    "one issue that can occur is that longer cycles often overlap shorter cycles . in terms of communities ,",
    "most inter - community edges contain few ( if any ) short cycles , but intra - community edges tend to contain both long and short cycles , since a long cycle can `` coil '' inside the community .",
    "if one were to just delete all 5-cycles in a graph , it is very possible to end up deleting all edges .",
    "there is quite a bit of leeway in how we choose @xmath10 and build @xmath33 , and we can use this to our advantage . for example , pick two cycle lengths @xmath36 and @xmath37 and compute @xmath38 and @xmath39 . then , build another set of edges , @xmath40 @xmath41 containing the set of edges that participate in @xmath42-cycles _ but not",
    "_ @xmath36-cycles .",
    "the graph @xmath43 will contain edges that tend to be between communities and not within , for an appropriate choice of @xmath42 and @xmath36 .",
    "one can think of this as a `` backbone '' of the network , and deleting these edges may be a useful pre - processing step for applying other community - detection algorithms , including betweenness  @xcite .",
    "we present example applications of the methods presented in section [ sec : cycles_communities ] to two networks : a network of ncaa division i - a football games held during the 2005 regular season and a sznajd network  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we discuss how these methods can break down and ways to overcome that .      in ncaa football , teams are grouped into _ conferences _ based on location . to save on transportation time and cost",
    ", more games are played between teams in the same conference than in different conferences .",
    "thus , a graph of the game schedule , where nodes are teams and edges connect teams that have played against each other , naturally exhibits community structure based on these conferences @xcite .",
    "figure [ ncaa_2005_orig.fig ] displays the original network , call it @xmath26 . as a first pass ,",
    "let s use @xmath35 and generate @xmath44 , pictured in figure [ ncaa_2005_3cycles.fig ] using the same layout as [ ncaa_2005_orig.fig ] .",
    "this deletes all edges that do not participate in 3-cycles .",
    "most deleted edges are between conferences , though some edges remain .",
    "this will not split the network into seperate components based on the communities but it may be useful as a preprocessing step for betweenness or another community detection algorithm .",
    "in addition , let us build @xmath40 , as per equation [ eqn_t_not_s ] .",
    "for this network , we have chosen @xmath45 .",
    "figure [ ncaa_2005_5not3.fig ] shows @xmath46 , again using the same layout as [ ncaa_2005_orig.fig ] . for improved clarity ,",
    "figure [ ncaa_2005_5not3_newlayout.fig ] shows @xmath47 with a layout emphasizing that all edges are between conferences .",
    "we propose that edges in @xmath48 comprise the majority of this network s inter - community structure . to test this",
    ", one can compare the distributions of edge betweenness for these backbone and non - backbone edges , as shown in figure [ hist_ncaa.fig ] .",
    "backbone edges tend to carry much higher betweenness values than the more common non - backbone edges .",
    "one particularly interesting category of complex networks are the so - called _ geographical models _",
    "( e.g.  @xcite ) , whose nodes have well - defined positions in an embedding metric space @xmath49 .",
    "typically , the connectivity in such networks is affected by the adjacency and/or the distance between pairs of nodes , with nodes which are closer one another having higher probability of being connected . as an immediate consequence of such an organizing principle ,",
    "communities in traditional geographical communites are closely related to the presence of spatial clusters of nodes , i.e. groups of nodes which are closer one another than with the rest of the network .",
    "introduced recently , the family of geographical networks known as _ sznajd networks _  @xcite allow rich community structure as a consequence of running the sznajd opinion formation dynamics  @xcite among the network edges instead of considering the states associated to each network node .",
    "starting with a traditional geographical network ( called the _ underlying network _",
    "@xmath50 ) where the connections are defined with probability proportional to the distances between pairs of nodes , a percentage of edges of @xmath50 are removed , yielding the initial condition for the sznajd dynamics .",
    "then , edges from @xmath50 are chosen randomly and used to influence the respective surrounding connectivity .",
    "for instance , in case the chosen edge @xmath51 is on ( i.e. it does correspond to a link in the current growth stage ) , the edges in @xmath50 which are connected to the nodes @xmath5 and @xmath10 are established with probability @xmath52 .",
    "an analogue procedure is considered with respect to edges which are absent . in order to avoid convergence to the trivial ground states where all edges are set on or off",
    ", the dynamics also consider as feedback the total number of established edges .",
    "figure [ sznajd_3dashed.fig ] shows a sznajd network .",
    "edges that do not participate in 3-cycles are indicated . as can be seen , many of these edges fall `` outside '' of the more dense regions of the network .",
    "this is a good first pass , and may be used to initialize another algorithm , similar to our football result , but it will not give detailed information on the hierarchical community structure .    figure [ sznajd_5not3bold.fig ] shows the same network as [ sznajd_3dashed.fig ] , but with the edges of @xmath48 highlighted .",
    "one can imagine removing both the @xmath53 and @xmath48 edges to further enhance the separation .",
    "the identification and characterization of the communities present in complex networks stands out as one of the most important approaches for understanding their structure and possible formation and evolution . at the same time",
    ", the distribution of cycles of various lengths in a complex network has important implications for the connectivity , resilience and dynamics of the respectively studied networks .",
    "the current work brought together these two important trends , in the sense of applying short cycle detection as the means to help the identification of communities in complex networks .",
    "the suggested methodology has been applied with promising results to the identification of communities in a theoretical network model , more specifically a sznajd geometrical networks , as well as to a real - world network ( ncaa ) .",
    "the relationship between the cycles and communities in the football network has been further investigated in terms of the betweeness centrality measurement , confirming that the obtained backbone edges tend to exhibit higher betweeness values ."
