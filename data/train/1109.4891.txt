    "in particular , @xcite developed a multi - wavelength rt code that employs radiative equilibrium and an adaptive refinement grid , which reproduced the observed dust properties of the most distant quasars detected at @xmath9 when applied to the hydrodynamic quasar simulations of @xcite .",
    "however , most of these developments focused mainly on radiation transport in dusty environments , in particular the absorption and re - emission by dust , of local star - forming regions . in order to explain the diverse properties of laes and their evolution with redshift , it is critical to couple @xmath0 with continuum , in the context of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "several aspects of such an approach have been attempted in previous studies . for examples , @xcite incorporated pre - computed grid of @xmath0 rt into ionization calculations , @xcite considered a combination of @xmath0 and ionization rt , @xcite studied the effect of ionization and dust on transfer of @xmath0 photons , while @xcite included dust and non - ionizing uv continuum in the @xmath0 rt calculations .",
    "an ultimate goal would be to tackle the ionization of hydrogen , non - ionizing continuum , interstellar dust , and @xmath0 propagation and scattering simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , the implementation of @xmath0 emission should include two major generation mechanisms , the recombination of ionizing photons , and collisional excitation of hydrogen gas .",
    "in addition , relevant ionizing sources such as stars , active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , and uv background radiation should be included .",
    "last , but not the least , the rt code should incorporate an adaptive refinement grid in order to cover a large dynamical range and resolve dense gas regions where star formation takes place and prominent @xmath0 emission comes from @xcite .",
    "in this work , we present a new , 3-d monte carlo rt code , all - wavelength radiative transfer with adaptive refinement tree ( @xmath1 ) , which couples @xmath0 line and multi - wavelength continuum , for the study of panchromatic properties of galaxies and ism .",
    "( note that the `` coupling '' in this paper means the rt of @xmath0 with other continuum photons , not the coupling between rt and hydrodynamics . )",
    "our code improves over the original continuum - only version of @xcite , and features three essential modules : continuum emission from x - ray to radio , @xmath0 emission from both recombination and collisional excitation , and ionization of neutral hydrogen .",
    "the coupling of these three modules enables a self - consistent and accurate calculation of the @xmath0 and multi - wavelength properties of galaxies , as the equivalent width of the @xmath0 line depends on the uv continuum , and the escape fraction of @xmath0 photons strongly depends on the ionization structure and the dust content of the object .",
    "moreover , the adaptive refinement grid handles arbitrary geometry and efficiently traces inhomogeneous density distribution in galaxies and ism .",
    "furthermore , this code takes into account radiation from both stars and accreting black holes , so it can be used to study both galaxies and agns .",
    "@xmath1 can produce a number of observables , including spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from x - ray to radio , multi - band fluxes and images , @xmath0 emission line and its ew , which can be directly compared to real observations .",
    "it has a wide range of applications , and can be easily applied to simulations using either grid - based or smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) codes by converting the simulation snapshot to the grid structure of @xmath1 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we describe the @xmath1 code , which includes implementation of three modules of continuum , @xmath0 line , and ionization of hydrogen , the adaptive refinement grid , and the dust model . in  3 , we present the application of @xmath1 to a sph cosmological simulation , and study in details the @xmath0 emission and multi - band properties from individual galaxies at redshifts z=8.5 , 6.2 , and 3.1 from the simulation .",
    "we discuss in  4 contribution to @xmath0 emission from agns , stars , and excitation cooling from gas accretion in our model , and effects of numerical resolutions on the rt calculations , and summarize in  5 .",
    "art@xmath10 is a 3-d , monte carlo rt code based on the original version of @xcite , which included the continuum emission from x - ray to radio , and an adaptive refinement grid .",
    "we have added two more modules , @xmath0 emission from both recombination and collisional excitation , and ionization of neutral hydrogen , to the current version and couple them self - consistently .",
    "the continuum part was described in details in @xcite . here",
    "we briefly outline the continuum procedure , and focus on the new implementations of @xmath0 line and ionization .",
    "the continuum module in @xmath1 was developed in @xcite , which adopted the radiative equilibrium algorithm of @xcite . in dusty environments , absorbed",
    "radiation energy by dust is re - emitted as thermal emission .",
    "the re - emitted spectrum depends on the temperature of the dust , which is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with the radiation field .",
    "the radiative equilibrium is ensured by performing the monte carlo transfer iteratively until the dust temperature distribution converges , which can be computationally expensive . to accelerate the calculation",
    ", @xmath1 uses the ",
    "immediate reemission \" scheme @xcite , in which the dust temperature is immediately updated on absorption of a photon packet , and the frequency of re - emitted photons are sampled from a spectrum that takes into account the modified temperature .",
    "the temperature is determined by the balance between the stacked energy absorbed by dust in the cell and the thermal emission from them .",
    "the emitted energy in a cell in the time interval @xmath11 is    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the planck mean opacity , @xmath14 is the frequency integrated planck function , and @xmath15 is the dust mass in the cell , the subscript @xmath16 indicates the @xmath16th cell .",
    "solving the balance between the absorbed and emitted energy , we obtain the dust temperature as follows after absorbing @xmath17 packets ,    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the total number of photon packets in the simulation , and @xmath20 is the total source luminosity .",
    "note that because the dust opacity is temperature - independent , the product @xmath21 increases monotonically with temperature .",
    "consequently , @xmath22 always increases when the cell absorbs an additional packet .",
    "the added energy to be radiated owing to the temperature increase @xmath23 is determined by a temperature - corrected emissivity @xmath24 in the following approximation when the temperature increase , @xmath23 , is small :    @xmath25    the re - emitted packets , which comprise the diffuse radiation field , then continue to be scattered , absorbed , and re - emitted until they finally escape from the system .",
    "this method conserves the total energy exactly , and does not require any iteration as the emergent sed , @xmath26 , corresponds to the equilibrium temperature distribution .",
    "hydrogen @xmath0 photon corresponds to the transition between the @xmath27 and @xmath28 levels of a hydrogen atom .",
    "it is the strongest hi transition .",
    "the rt of @xmath0 photons is determined by @xmath0 resonant scattering , dust absorption and scattering , and ionization state of the medium .",
    "the process is highly complicated in galaxies owing to the complex geometry and gas distribution . in order to accelerate the numerical convergence of the rt process ,",

    "moreover , we treat both recombination and collisional excitation for @xmath0 emission .      the optical depth @xmath29 of a @xmath0 photon with frequency @xmath30 traveling a path of length @xmath31 is determined by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number density of neutral hydrogen gas with parallel velocity component @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the scattering cross section as a function of frequency . in the rest frame of the hydrogen atom",

    "some previous work approximated the voigt function with a gaussian fitting in the core and a power law fitting in the wing .",
    "however , since this approximation causes a relative error of a few tens per cent at the transit region , we use the analytical fit of @xcite , @xmath45 where @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this approximation fits the voigt function well for all frequencies , and the relative error is always less than 1 percent above a temperature of 2k .",
    "the optical depth of dust absorption and scattering is estimated as , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the dust mass and @xmath51 is the mass opacity coefficient of absorption and scattering .",
    "when the stacked optical depth through passing cells achieves an optical depth determined by equation  ( [ eq : tau ] ) , the encountering medium is chosen using a random number by comparing with the fraction , @xmath52 .",
    "when @xmath0 photons are scattered by neutral hydrogen atoms , the frequency in laboratory frame is changed depending on the velocity components of the atoms and the direction of the incidence and the scattering .",
    "then the velocity components of the directions perpendicular to the incident direction will follow a gaussian distribution , and can be generated by a simple box - muller method @xcite . however , the parallel component of the velocity depends on relative frequency @xmath53 of the incident photon owing to the resonance nature of the scattering .",
    "the probability distribution of the parallel component is drawn from @xmath54 where @xmath55 is velocity of the parallel component normalized by thermal velocity @xmath56 ( hereafter @xmath57 means normalized velocity by @xmath56 ) . to follow this distribution , we use the method of @xcite .",
    "when a photon has a frequency @xmath58 in the optically - thick cell , where @xmath59 is the boundary between the core and the wing of the voigt profile , i.e. , where @xmath60 , it can not travel long distance and is confined in the cell with numerous scattering .",
    "only when it has a large x from scattering by high velocity atoms can it escape from the cell and travel long distance .",
    "the photon usually experiences many scatterings ( @xmath61 ) before it moves into the wing , it is therefore extremely computation costly to trace this process for all photon packets . in order to speed up the calculation , in particular to avoid the huge number of scatterings in the core",
    ", we use a core skipping method developed by @xcite and follow the procedure of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it artificially push the photon in the wing by scattering with atoms which have high velocity in the direction perpendicular to the incident direction .",
    "the velocity of the perpendicular component @xmath62 is generated from a truncated gaussian , @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are two univariates , and we use the critical frequency @xmath66 introduced in @xcite , i.e. , @xmath67 where @xmath68 for @xmath69 , or @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "this acceleration scheme can reduce the calculation time by several orders of magnitude , and can produce a line profile which agrees well with analytical solutions in a static slab .    the frequency after scattering depends on the direction in which the photon is scattered .",
    "the direction is given by the phase function , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the angle between the incident direction @xmath74 and the outgoing direction @xmath75 , and @xmath76 is the degree of polarization .",
    "the ratio @xmath76 becomes 3/7 for the @xmath77 state in @xmath58 @xcite , and 1 for the scattering in the wing @xcite .",
    "the transition from @xmath78 in the core , together with the core skipping scheme , results in isotropic scattering .",
    "the difference in the phase function does not affect the @xmath0 properties such as the escape fraction @xmath79 , the emergent line profile and luminosity , even if a single phase function is used for all scatterings ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we simply assume an isotropic scattering for all the scattering process in this work .",
    "we should point out , however , that the phase function becomes important in the polarization effect of @xmath0 line ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and so care must be taken in dealing with that .    in the scattering process , the final frequency in the laboratory frame is then @xmath80 where the factor @xmath81 takes into account the recoil effect @xcite with @xmath82 being the planck constant .",
    "we trace the @xmath0 photon packet until it is absorbed by dust or escapes from a galaxy ( e.g. , when the photons move out of the calculation box typically 10 times larger than the virial radius of a galaxy ) .",

    "some galaxies at higher redshift @xmath299 show very high ew because the excitation @xmath0 cooling becomes dominant @xcite .",

    "we collect all escaped @xmath0 photons and estimate the line profile . in practice ,",
    "the inhomogeneous gas structure can cause the change of flux depending on the viewing angle .",
    "although the @xmath0 flux can change by some factors @xcite , we focus on only the mean value in this paper .    the @xmath0 lines of our galaxies show mostly a single peak , a common profile of laes at high redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in a static and optically thick medium",
    ", the profile can be double peaked , but when the effective optical depth is small due to high relative gas speed or ionization state , there might be only a single peak @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the flow speed of gas is up to @xmath306 , and the gas is highly ionized by stellar and agn radiation , which result in a single peak .",
    "in addition , the profile at higher redshift shifts to shorter wavelength , and it shows the characteristic shape of gas inflow @xcite .",
    "although our simulation includes feedback of stellar wind similar to that of @xcite , the @xmath0 line profile indicates gas inflow or symetric in these galaxies .",
    "our result suggests that high - redshift star - forming galaxies may be fueled by efficient inflow of cold gas from the filaments .",
    "we will address this issue in detail in a forthcoming paper ( yajima et al . in preparation ) .",

    "it has been suggested that the igm correction of @xmath0 emission may be enhanced due to inflow ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or decreased via outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , there is a large uncertainty in the prescription of wind feedback in current simulations . to investigate the velocity field of ism in high - redshift galaxies",
    ", one needs simulations with a realistic wind model and a high spatial resolution comparable to that of line observations , which are currently unavailable and are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "moreover , we should point out that the line profile can change due to the difference of the sub - grid ism models .",
    "in addition , the line profile may be highly suppressed and changed by scattering in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the igm effectively absorbs the @xmath0 photons at the line center and at shorter wavelengths by the hubble flow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". therefore , the inflow feature in our profiles may be disappeared and the shape may change to an asymmetric single peak with only photons at red wing .",

    "the escape fraction of the most massive galaxies has a range of @xmath308 , consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath307 decreases with increasing redshift .",
    "unlike the @xmath0 and non - ionizing uv photons , the ionizing photons can be absorbed by hydrogen gas and dust . at high redshift ,",
    "the star formation efficiency is small , so a large fraction of hydrogen gas remains neutral and prevent the escape of ionizing photons .",
    "the median values do not decrease with redshift due to lower dust mass .",
    "the emissivity of the ionizing photons roughly increase with decreasing redshift , reaching @xmath309 at @xmath178 . in this work ,",
    "we do not calculate the rt in the igm , but the size of the hii bubble around the galaxy may be estimated by a modified strmgrem sphere . assuming a clumpiness factor of @xmath310 @xcite , the radius of the hii bubble is estimated to be @xmath311 and @xmath312 kpc at @xmath313 and @xmath314 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath0 photons may pass through the hii bubbles , resulting in a correlation between high - redshift laes and hii regions , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "in addition , the median value of ionizing - photons emissivity is smaller due to lower sfr , and hence the hii bubble becomes smaller than that of the most massive galaxy by a factor of @xmath315 .",
    "in observations of @xmath0 emission from high - redshift galaxies , there are a number of uncertainties regarding the contributions from agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , stars , and excitation cooling from cold accretion . with our model , we can separate the radiation components and disentangle the contribution from different sources .",
    "also , in numerical simulations , resolution plays an important role in the robustness of the results .",
    "so we discuss these physical and numerical effects on @xmath0 emission in this section .",
    "photons ( top panel ) and the emergent luminosity ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the ionization and @xmath0 luminosity are estimated with radiation from the following sources : uvb only ( triangles ) , uvb + star ( squares ) , and uvb + agn + star ( circles ) . ]    the effects of agn and stars on the @xmath0 emission is shown in figure  [ fig : fesc_comp_star ] .",
    "it appears that the presence of agn does not change significantly the @xmath0 escape fraction .",
    "it is because agns are usually located in galactic center where the gas density peaks , most of the ionizing photons near lyman - limit ( @xmath316 ) are trapped there ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and can not escape . on the other hand",
    ", a fraction of high energy photons can escape from the galaxy without ionizing interstellar gas due to small cross section of gas and dust .",
    "therefore , agn radiation has little effect on the @xmath79 of @xmath0 photons .",
    "there is no change in @xmath79 in the case where there is no stellar and agn radiation .",
    "in addition , the agn does not affect the @xmath0 luminosity , as shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : fesc_comp_star ] .",
    "this may be because the bhs in these galaxies are still quite small and the accretion rates are quite low . on the other hand , the presence of stars appears to change the escape fraction and emergent luminosity of @xmath0 , because the stellar radiation is much stronger than that of agn in the model galaxies , and the effect becomes stronger at lower redshift . because @xmath0 emissivity is produced by the recombination of ionizing photons and collisional excitation from hydrogen gas , the interplay between these two mechanisms determines the outcome . at redshifts @xmath268 ,",
    "excitation cooling from cold accretion of dense gas becomes comparable to recombination cooling , while at @xmath7 , the number of @xmath0 photons by recombination in hii regions by stars and agns outnumbers that from excitation cooling .",
    "therefore , the contribution from stars to the @xmath0 emission changes with cosmic time and environment .",
    "the @xmath0 emissivity from excitation cooling can be reduced due to the stellar ionization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . moreover , the distribution of excitation @xmath0 cooling can be more extended than star - forming regions , resulting in higher escape fraction .",
    "thus , the escape fraction and emergent luminosity of @xmath0 somewhat increase in the case without stellar radiation .",
    "figure  [ fig : fesc_comp_n ] demonstrates effects of photon number on the escape fraction of @xmath0 photons , with different number of photon packets , @xmath317 and @xmath318 .",
    "it appears that the results converge once the photon number is above @xmath319 , which is an order of magnitude lower than the fiducial @xmath227 in our general rt calculations .",
    "the relative difference between @xmath320 and @xmath318 is 1 - 6 per cent .",
    "of course , the photon number should increase with galaxy mass , but for our modeled galaxies , @xmath227 should be sufficient .     photons .",
    "open triangles , squares and circles indicate photon packet number @xmath321 , and @xmath318 , respectively .",
    "the fiducial number used in our general rt calculations is @xmath227 . ]",
    "different color indicates different maximum refinement level ( rl ) : purple  rl = 4 , blue ",
    "rl = 6 , green  rl = 8 , orange  rl = 10 , and red ",
    "the fiducial rl used in our general rt calculations is 11 .",
    "the cell size of the highest refinement level is @xmath322 mpc in comoving scale . ]",
    "the effects of grid resolution on the escape fraction of @xmath0 photons is presented in figure  [ fig : fesc_comp_l ] , where results from different maximum refinement level ( rl ) are compared .",
    "it appears that @xmath79 changes dramatically with rl , but it converges at @xmath323 .",
    "grids with poor resolution can produce artificially high @xmath79 by a factor of more than 20 . because most of the @xmath0 photons are created in high - density gas clumps , where they are also effectively absorbed by numerous scatterings , sufficiently resolving",
    "the gas density field is important in the calculation of @xmath0 rt .",
    "if we follow the resolution of @xmath324 with uniform grids , it would require a number of cells of @xmath325 , too expensive for rt simulations with the current computational facility .",
    "in fact , the current limit is @xmath326 , as demonstrated by recent work on three - dimensional rt calculations using uniform grid ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". therefore , adaptive refinement grid is critical in the rt calculation of @xmath0 emission .",
    "we have presented an improved , three - dimensional , monte carlo radiative transfer code @xmath1 to study multi - wavelength properties of galaxies .",
    "it has the following essential features :    * it couples @xmath0 line , ionization of neutral hydrogen , and multi - wavelength continuum radiative transfer .",
    "the @xmath0 module includes emission from both recombination and collisional excitation , and the continuum includes emission from x - ray to radio . *",
    "it employs an adaptive grid scheme in 3-d cartesian coordinates , which handles an arbitrary geometry and covers a large dynamic range over several orders of magnitude .",
    "such a grid is critical in resolving the clumpy , highly inhomogeneous density field in the rt calculations . *",
    "it adopts a two - phase ism model in which the cold , dense clouds are embedded in a hot , diffuse medium in pressure equilibrium . in the case where hydrodynamic simulations have sufficient resolution to resolve the multi - phase ism",
    ", this model ensures an appropriate prescription of the ism physics , which is important for studying dust properties in galaxies . *",
    "it includes a supernova - origin dust model in which the dust is produced by type - ii supernovae , which is especially relevant for dust in high - redshift , young objects , because there are insufficient low - mass , old agb stars in these systems to produce the observed amount of dust from the classical dust models .",
    "* it follows the radiation from stars and agns , and calculates the scattering , absorption , and re - emission of the surrounding medium .",
    "it efficiently and self - consistently produces seds and images in a full spectrum , including @xmath0 emission line and continuum from x - ray to millimeter , as well as ionization structures of the medium , for direct comparison with multi - band observations . *",
    "it can be easily applied to either grid- or particle - based hydrodynamical simulations and has broad applications in cosmology .",
    "we have tested the new @xmath1 extensively , and found that the coupling of @xmath0 line and continuum enables a self - consistent and accurate calculation of the @xmath0 properties of galaxies , as the equivalent width of the @xmath0 line depends on the uv continuum , and the escape fraction of @xmath0 photons strongly depends on the ionization structure and the dust content of the object .",
    "we applied the code to a cosmological sph simulation of a milky way - like galaxy , and studied in details a sample of massive galaxies at redshift z=3.1 - 10.2 .",
    "we find that most of these galaxies are @xmath0 emitters .",
    "the escape fraction of @xmath0 photons of the most massive galaxy in each snap shot increases with decreasing redshift , from about 0.18 at redshift @xmath255 to 0.6 at @xmath7 .",
    "the emergent @xmath0 luminosity shows similar trend , increasing from @xmath327 at @xmath255 to @xmath328 at @xmath7 .",
    "the equivalent widths of these galaxies change with redshift as well , from @xmath329 at @xmath255 to @xmath330 at @xmath7 .",
    "the profiles of the resulting @xmath0 lines commonly show single peak , and the peak of the profile at @xmath266 is shifted to shorter wavelength , implying gas inflow from surrounding filaments . on the other hand ,",
    "the median values in our galaxy sample shows somewhat different trend from that of the most massive ones .",
    "the escape fraction monotonically increases with redshift , while the @xmath0 luminosity shows a weak evolution , as a result of the interplay between sfr and escape fraction .",
    "our results suggest that the laes and their properties evolve with cosmic time , and that the first laes in the early universe , such as currently the most distant one detected at @xmath3 @xcite , may be dwarf galaxies with a total mass of @xmath302 fueled by cold gas accretion .",
