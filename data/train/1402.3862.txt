    "our experiment results are indeed in quite good agreement with this prediction , demonstrating the significance of the interaction effect in the expansion dynamics of a quasi-2d bose gas .",
    "as the trapping potential is released , the quasicondensate expands fast along the axial direction , but with a finite speed . because the interaction energy is not immediately quenched off but gradually decreases , the aforementioned accumulated phase @xmath73 for a momentum state would be larger than that in the non - interacting expansion case .",
    "then , for a given expansion time the interference condition for maximum density modulations would be satisfied with a smaller momentum state .",

    "the magnitude of the offset is almost same for all expansion times including @xmath98  ms [ fig .",

    ", there are non - negligible thermal populations in the axially excited states .",
    "because at @xmath100  nk @xmath101 m is still shorter than the imaging resolution , the contribution of the thermal component appears as a constant offset to the power spectrum .",

    "this work clearly demonstrated the significance of the interaction effect , in particular for expanding quasi-2d atomic gases .",
    "experimentally , the interaction effect can be suppressed in a deeper 2d regime with tighter axial confinement ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "alternatively , one may consider dynamic control of the interaction strength using feshbach resonances to forcefully turn off the interactions at the beginning of the expansion  @xcite .",
