    "chirality is a geometric property of a three - dimensional body not to coincide with its reflection in a mirror in any shifts and turns .",
    "such a property , for example , belongs to a human hand or a spring . the term `` chirality '' was proposed by lord kelvin in 1873 to explain some special properties of molecules @xcite .",
    "the chirality plays an important role in biology and pharmacy , because many complex organic compounds ( amino acids , proteins , and sugars ) have chiral properties .",
    "for this reason , a body can react differently with different enantiomers of the same substance .",
    "for example , the same drug , depending on what type of molecules it contains , may have a different taste and smell , or effect differently . in physics",
    ", there is a considerable interest to chiral media @xcite , in which there is a difference between the distributions of left- and right - handed circularly polarized electromagnetic waves .",
    "the simplest example of such an optically active medium is an aqueous solution of sugar . at the present time",
    ", the study of the chiral properties is again under special attention because of the possibility to create metamaterials based on chiral objects @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous emission of atoms and molecules in the vicinity of material bodies is studied in a large number of works .",
    "the influence of dielectric microspheres on the spontaneous emission of atoms is considered in @xcite , spontaneous emission of an atom located near a microsphere made of material with negative refraction was considered in @xcite for first time .",
    "optical properties of chiral spherical particles have also been studied quite extensively . at the present time , the scattering of plane electromagnetic waves on homogeneous @xcite and inhomogeneous @xcite chiral microspheres , including multilayered chiral microspheres @xcite , is already considered .",
    "the scattering of a hermitian laser beam on a chiral microsphere is studied in @xcite , the scattering of a plane electromagnetic wave by a chiral sphere located in a chiral medium is considered in @xcite .",
    "the radiation pressure force acting on a chiral spherical particle placed in circularly polarized wave is examined in @xcite .",
    "finally , the radiation of a point dipole source located inside a chiral spherical particle was regarded in @xcite . at the same time , as far as we know , there is no investigation devoted to the influence of chiral spherical particles on the radiation of chiral ( optically active ) molecules .",
    "however , such processes become more and more important because they always appear when different biomolecules and drug molecules are investigated and modified by optical methods .",
    "so , in this paper we will present the detailed investigation of this problem    the goal of the present work is to develop an approach that allows describing quantitatively the influence of a chiral spherical particle made of an arbitrary metamaterial on the spontaneous emission of a chiral molecule .",
    "all results will be obtained in the framework of nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics , in the assumption that the radiative linewidth of the molecule is much smaller than the frequency of radiation .",

    "it is important to note that both the results of calculations obtained in the framework of the full qed theory ( present paper ) , and in the framework of a simplified quasistatic calculations presented at the beginning of this section ( see also @xcite ) yield almost identical results , confirming the correctness of both approaches .",
    "the figure  [ fig6 ] shows the ratio of the effective radiative decay rate of spontaneous emission of the `` left '' molecule and the radiative decay rate of the `` right '' molecule and vice versa . from this figure",
    ", it follows that if the condition ( [ eq52 ] ) is satisfied , then the decay rates of `` left '' and `` right '' molecules differ by the factor 15 or 60 or even more , depending on the chirality of the molecule considered as a reference one . in other words , nanoparticles with the parameter given by eq .",
    "( [ eq52 ] ) will enhance the radiation of the `` right '' molecules and slow down the radiation of the `` left '' molecules and vice versa .",
    "let us stress that `` left - handedness '' of a chiral sphere or its negative @xmath7 are of crucial importance for such discrimination .",
    "possible applications of the effect of discrimination of the radiation one can find in @xcite .",
    "thus , in the present work the analytical expressions for the radiative decay rate of spontaneous emission of a chiral molecule located near an arbitrary spherical particle with chiral properties were obtained and investigated within full qed theory . using this approach , the spontaneous emission decay rates of chiral molecule placed near a spherical particle made of different materials ( dielectrics , metals , `` left - handed '' metamaterials etc . )",
    "were investigated in details .",
    "it is shown that nonzero chirality of a spherical particle leads to an increase in the number of excited modes in comparison with nonchiral one due to coupling between left- and right - polarized waves .",
    "quasistatic expressions for the radiative decay rate of spontaneous emission of chiral molecule located near a chiral nanosphere were obtained and investigated .",
    "these expressions are in good agreement with the exact qed results and allow one to estimate the parameters of nanoparticles when the radiation of `` right '' or `` left '' molecules is suppressed .",
    "it was found that for the suppression of the radiation of the `` left '' molecules the sphere should be made of mng metamaterials , while for the suppression of radiation the `` right '' molecules the dng materials should be used .",
    "the results obtained can be used to calculate the radiative decay rate of spontaneous emission of chiral molecules in the vicinity of the chiral spherical particles , for interpretation of experimental data on interaction of chiral molecules and particles , and for detection and selection of chiral molecules with the help of chiral particles .",
