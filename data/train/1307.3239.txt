    "the wavelength - dependent manner in which a planetary atmosphere reflects incident starlight reveals valuable details about its structure and composition . in this letter , we present albedo measurements for the transiting hot jupiter hd189733b across the wavelength range @xmath4 nm .    at these wavelengths ,",
    "clear atmosphere models ( i.e.  without clouds ) predict that hot jupiter albedos are suppressed by alkali absorption @xcite .",
    "observations to date have been largely consistent with these expectations .",
    "models also predict , however , that silicates and iron could condense in the uppermost layers of some atmospheres , raising the albedo significantly @xcite .",
    "for instance , reflective clouds seem necessary to explain the relatively high albedo of kepler-7b @xcite .    by measuring the reflection signal of hd189733b ,",
    "our goal was to gauge the role of clouds / hazes in the atmosphere of this well - studied hot jupiter .",
    "motivation came from the observed transmission spectrum , which slopes downward from 290 nm out to 1@xmath5 m @xcite and possibly further into the infrared .",
    "a likely explanation for this feature is rayleigh scattering by a high altitude haze of dust .",
    "furthermore , @xcite detected the narrow core of the na 589 nm doublet in transmission , but not the pressure - broadened wings that would be expected in a clear atmosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "indirect evidence of clouds on the dayside hemisphere has also been identified by @xcite , who speculated that the albedo of hd189733b might be high as a result .    in practice , we measured the reflection signal by monitoring the change in brightness of the star - planet system that occurred during secondary eclipse . unlike the primary transit , which allows us to probe the day - night terminator region of the atmosphere",
    ", the secondary eclipse signal is directly related to the brightness of the dayside hemisphere .",
    "although secondary eclipses have been measured previously for hd189733b at infrared wavelengths @xcite , our new observation constitutes the first measured for hd189733b at short wavelengths , where thermal emission from the planet is negligible .",
    "any detected light is therefore entirely due to scattering by the atmosphere .",
    "this allows us to place unambiguous constraints on the geometric albedo @xmath6 , according to : @xmath7^{-2 } \\",
    ", \\label{eq : ag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the fractional eclipse depth , @xmath9 is the ratio of the planet and star radii , and @xmath10 is the orbital semimajor axis",
    ". equation [ eq : ag ] follows from the formal definition of @xmath6 , namely , the observed flux of scattered light at full phase divided by the flux that an isotropically scattering disk with the same cross - sectional area would have if it were placed at the same location as the planet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one secondary eclipse of hd189733b was observed over four hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) orbits using the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) g430l grating ( 290570 nm ) for programme go-13006 ( p.i .",
    ", f.  pont ) on 2012 december 20 .",
    "spectra taken during the first orbit exhibited much larger systematics than those taken in subsequent orbits due to settling of the telescope into its new pointing position and were not included in the analysis . of the remaining three orbits , the first and third sampled the out - of - eclipse flux while the planet was close to full phase ( star plus planet ) , and the second sampled the in - eclipse flux while the planet was fully obscured by the star ( star only ) .",
    "we used a wide @xmath11 slit to minimise time - varying slit losses caused by pointing drifts and reduced overheads by reading out only the @xmath12 pixel subarray containing the target spectrum . based on previous experience with _",
    "hst_/stis observations , we expected the first exposure of each satellite orbit to have systematically lower counts than the exposures immediately following .",
    "for this reason , a dummy 1s exposure was taken at the beginning of each orbit , followed by a series of 35 science exposures with integration times of 64s .",
    "unfortunately , the first science exposure of each satellite orbit still exhibited systematically lower flux levels , so we discarded these as well .",
    "our final dataset thus consisted of 102 spectra taken over 237mins .     ]",
    "images were reduced using the calstis v2.40 pipeline and cleaned for cosmic rays .",
    "the spectra were then extracted using the iraf ` p`ll  routine with a 13 pixel - wide aperture .",
    "background subtraction was not performed , as the background contribution was negligible .",
    "spectra were doppler - corrected to the heliocentric rest frame , corresponding to shifts of @xmath31 pixel along the dispersion axis .",
    "we generated photometric time series by integrating the flux from each individual exposure across the dispersion axis within different wavelength bins .",
    "separate analyses were performed for a two - channel and six - channel binning : figure [ fig : stellar_spectrum ] shows the mean system spectrum with adopted wavelength bins overplotted and table [ tab : reflection_spectrum ] explicitly lists the wavelength ranges .",

    "the measured flux is dominated by an approximately repeatable decrease of @xmath315003000ppm .",
    "smaller amplitude correlations on shorter time scales are also evident , as well as a longer term decrease in the baseline flux level .",
    "similar systematics are observed for the six - channel lightcurves , and are believed to be primarily caused by the thermal cycle of the satellite and the drift of the spectral trace across the detector ( eg . * ? ? ?",

    "we modelled the systematics and eclipse signal simultaneously as a gaussian process ( gp ) , following the approach of @xcite . under the gp framework ,",

    "parameterizing the covariance according to equation [ eq : sqexp ] , we effectively model the poorly understood systematics as varying smoothly with respect to the auxiliary variables , without actually having to specify the functional form .",
    "see @xcite for more details .    for auxiliary variables",
    ", we used the orbital phase of the satellite @xmath49 and the tilt of the spectral trace on the detector @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath49-dependence accounted for the dominant systematic that repeated from orbit to orbit , while the @xmath50-dependence accounted for the smaller - amplitude , higher - frequency correlations as well as the longer - term decrease in the flux baseline level ( figure [ fig : lightcurves1 ] ) .",
    "the latter was caused by an overall drift in the value of @xmath50 throughout the observations , in addition to the smaller - amplitude jitter within orbits .",
    "we also tried using the measured shifts of the spectral trace along the dispersion @xmath51-axis and cross - dispersion @xmath52-axis as additional auxiliary variables , but found their inclusion had an insignificant effect on the result .",
    "our final parameter set therefore consisted of @xmath53 .",
    "to marginalize equation [ eq : gp_logp ] over the space spanned by @xmath32 , we used the open source software package pymc @xcite to implement markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) sampling with the metropolis - hastings algorithm @xcite .",
    "we ran five chains of 120,000 steps each , where a single step consisted of cycling through the parameters and updating their values one at a time .",
    "random step sizes were adjusted separately for each parameter to maintain step acceptance rates of 2040% throughout the chains . after discarding the first 20,000 steps as burn - in , the gelman - rubin values @xcite were found to be well within 1% for all parameters , suggesting that the chains had converged and were well - mixed .    as a check , we also modelled the systematics with different linear combinations of the auxiliary variables and used the bayesian information criterion @xcite to choose between models .",
    "this has become a standard approach for analyzing _",
    "hst_/stis primary transit lightcurves ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the eclipse depths inferred from these analyses were consistent with those obtained using the gp model , verifying the robustness of the results to the treatment of instrumental systematics .",
    "best - fit gp models for the two - channel binning are shown in figure [ fig : lightcurves1 ] , with corrected lightcurves in the bottom panels . inferred eclipse depths @xmath8",
    "are reported in table [ tab : reflection_spectrum ] for all wavelength channels .",
    "the median of the combined mcmc chain is quoted with uncertainties that correspond to ranges either side containing 34% of the samples .",
    "maximum likelihood estimates were also obtained for each parameter using the nelder - mead simplex algorithm @xcite to optimize the joint gp likelihood given by equation [ eq : gp_logp ] with respect to @xmath32 , taking the median mcmc chain values as starting points . in all cases , the binned chain values for @xmath8 had gaussian - like distributions and the maximum likelihood solutions were very close to the median chain values .",
    "table [ tab : reflection_spectrum ] also lists the values for the geometric albedo @xmath6 , calculated using equation [ eq : ag ] with the measured @xmath8 values , @xmath54 @xcite , and @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the most striking result is that the measured albedo in the wavelength range 290450 nm ( @xmath0 ) is significantly higher than it is in the wavelength range 450570 nm ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the broad trend of decreasing eclipse depth from shorter to longer wavelengths is also recovered from the six - channel analysis .    in principle",
    ", variations in the brightness of the star itself , rather than the planetary eclipse , could be responsible for the measured signal .",
    "this is particularly pertinent for hd189733 , which is known to be an active k dwarf .",
    "however , if we assume 5000k and 4200k nextgen models @xcite for the star and spot spectra , respectively , with solar metallicity and @xmath56 , we find the flux drop in the 290450 nm channel would only be @xmath310% greater than the flux drop in the 450570 nm channel .",
    "the measured difference is significantly larger than this .",
    "we can also estimate the characteristic amplitude of flux variations due to stellar activity using the power law index of @xmath57 obtained by for the combined power spectrum of the brightest k dwarfs in the q1 _ kepler _ dataset . scaling this to the @xmath58% variation amplitude over @xmath59day timescales appropriate for hd189733",
    ", we obtain a corresponding amplitude of @xmath330ppm in the 290450 nm channel on timescales of 96minutes ( i.e.  _ hst _ orbital period ) .",
    "this is less than half the flux change observed and slightly smaller than the uncertainty on @xmath8 due to other sources .",
    "we therefore consider it unlikely that stellar variability could account for the signal , and assume that we have indeed measured the planetary eclipse .",
    "we are not the first to claim that the albedo of hd189733b decreases across the visible wavelength range .",
    "@xcite used polarimetry to infer albedos of @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the @xmath62 ( 390480 nm ) and @xmath63 ( 500590 nm ) bands , respectively .",
    "our results are systematically @xmath64 lower than these values .",
    "15bar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . _ bottom panel _ : measured geometric albedos for the two - channel analysis ( black crosses ) , with vertical bars indicating @xmath2 uncertainties and horizontal bars indicating the extent of the corresponding wavelength channels .",
    "toy model predictions ( gray lines ) are also shown for the different cloud altitudes in the top panel.[fig : reflection_spectrum ] ]",
    "to first order , the reflection spectrum of a hot jupiter at visible wavelengths will depend on whether or not there are reflective clouds in the atmosphere , and the altitude at which they become optically thick ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if scattering clouds are present and become optically thick at altitudes above the absorption wings of the na 589 nm doublet and other atomic and molecular absorbers , high albedos ( @xmath65 ) can be maintained throughout the visible wavelength range ( e.g.  class v models of * ? ? ?",
    ". if there are no clouds , or clouds are present but became optically thick at altitudes well below the absorption , then the albedo can be much lower .",
    "expected values at visible wavelengths in this case will be @xmath66 ( e.g.   irradiated  class iv models of * ? ? ?",
    "in intermediate cases , if clouds are present and become optically thick at pressures comparable to the na absorption wings , the albedo can be high in the blue channel relative to the red channel ( e.g.   isolated  class iv models of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this list is by no means exhaustive - additional complicating factors could include the possible depletion of na or the presence of condensates that absorb , rather than scatter , incident light .",
    "however , we currently have no reason to suspect that these apply to hd189733b , and given the modest resolution and precision of our measurements , we restrict our discussion to the cases described above . of these ,",
    "the significantly higher albedo that is measured in the blue channel compared to the red channel is only compatible with the intermediate - altitude cloud scenario .    to investigate this possibility further , we developed a simple toy model to estimate the expected albedo spectrum .",
    "first , we took the photon deposition pressure as a function of wavelength from the pl class model of @xcite ( see their figure 9 ) and assumed this pressure was inversely proportional to absorption .",
    "second , we used a rayleigh @xmath67 scattering profile to model the effect of reflective clouds made up of small dust grains . to simulate clouds that became optically thick at different altitudes",
    ", we varied the height of the rayleigh profile relative to absorption in steps of two atmospheric pressure scale heights , from a high level covering the wings of the na 589 nm doublet , down to the altitude where scattering by h@xmath68 molecules becomes important .",
    "third , with the absorption and scattering profiles defined , we calculated the albedo according to the two - stream approximation of @xcite : @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the ratio of absorption to total opacity ( absorption plus scattering ) in a given passband .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : reflection_spectrum ] shows the adopted opacity profiles , split between absorption and scattering contributions , and the bottom panel shows the predicted albedo spectra with our measured values overplotted .",
    "the model with clouds becoming optically thick two scale heights above the base of the absorption profile provides a reasonable fit , although the observations favor a steeper decrease of the albedo toward longer wavelengths .",
    "models with either gray ( i.e.  wavelength - independent ) scattering and na absorption , or rayleigh scattering and gray absorption , were also considered but gave shallower slopes between the two channels .",
    "an interesting question is whether or not the reflection signal is caused by the same scattering species that produces the rayleigh profile in the transmission spectrum . given the strong atmospheric circulation expected for hot jupiters , this seems plausible ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . identified enstatite grains ( mgsio@xmath71 ) as likely candidates , being transparent in the visible and formed of atoms abundant in hot atmospheres .",
    "the limited precision of the current data prevents us from ruling out more intricate scenarios .",
    "for example , a high altitude tenuous haze could account for the transmission signal while being transparent at zenith geometry , with a lower , denser layer of clouds producing the reflection signal .",
    "the absorption in the red channel could also be due to an absorber other than na , yet to be identified .",
    "for instance , tio is an efficient absorber in the red channel , although it is expected to have rained out of the atmosphere of hd189733b @xcite .",
    "our results are suggestive of a low bond albedo @xmath72 , which is defined as the fraction of incident starlight reflected to space at all wavelengths over all angles .",
    "this follows from the simple argument that if the na 589 nm doublet is not entirely masked by clouds , the situation could be similar at wavelengths beyond 589 nm where theory predicts significant absorption by the k 770 nm doublet and molecules such as ch@xmath73 and h@xmath68o ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , our observations do not provide a model - independent constraint on @xmath72 , as only @xmath35% and @xmath315% of the stellar flux is emitted in the blue and red channels , respectively .",
    "probability range for hd189733b derived in this study ( gray box ) .",
    "solar system albedos are from @xcite , except for the venus albedo which comes from @xcite . also shown are three models from @xcite ( open circles ) : ( a ) irradiated class iv , ( b ) isolated class iv , and ( c ) class v. [ fig : color_plot ] ]    finally , in figure [ fig : color_plot ] we show the blue - versus - red albedos for hd189733b and a selection of solar system bodies that also have thick atmospheres , and predicted albedos from three hot jupiter models .",
    "@xcite hypothesize that hd189733b might have a reflection spectrum similar to neptune . however , our best - fit albedos suggest that it is a deep , dark blue , quite distinct from the atmosphere colors seen in our solar system .",
    "the results presented here demonstrate the potential of secondary eclipse observations with _ hst_/stis .",
    "our albedo measurements add another piece to the growing jigsaw puzzle of empirical constraints on hd189733b s atmosphere , through which we are gradually moving toward a more complete understanding of this exotic planet .",
