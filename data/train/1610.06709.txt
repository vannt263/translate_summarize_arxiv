    "light and microwaves ( mws ) are important tools for controlling dynamics of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) .",
    "in addition to creating traps and optical lattices @xcite , various optical patterns , including vortices , have potential application in the realm of quantum data processing , as the light patterns can be stored in the form of intrinsic atomic states in bec , and released back in the optical form @xcite .",
    "furthermore , light can generate entangled vortices in separated condensates @xcite .",
    "the bec  feedback on the light propagation , i.e. , the _ local field effect _ ( lfe ) , may lead to the creation of hybrid light - matter states dong1,dong2,dong3,can , fir , bub .",
    "the electric lfe explains asymmetric matter - wave diffraction @xcite and predicts polaritonic solitons in soft optical lattices @xcite .",
    "further , the magnetic lfe couples mws to a pseudo - spinor ( two - component ) bec of two - level atoms , thus opening the way to the creation of hybrid microwave - matter - wave solitons @xcite . on the other hand , in current experiments with the pseudo - spinor becs , atoms are first transferred to an intermediate level using a mw field , and then further driven to a target level using a radiation - frequency fields , which would not allow one to observe manifestations of the magnetic lfe .",
    "this should become possible if the experiments can be performed with the mw field directly transferring the atoms between the two relevant states .",
    "the lfe plays an increasingly important role in bec with the increase of the number of atoms , which can exceed @xmath13 , as predicted theoretically large and demonstrated experimentally @xcite , allowing the lfe - induced long - range interactions between atoms @xcite to produce new manifestations of nonlocal physics .",
    "actually , the long - range interaction may cover the whole gas , in contrast with fast - decaying nonlocal interactions in optics @xcite and in dipolar bec cr , dy , er , polar , dipv , ddreview . unlike the species - dependent dipolar forces @xcite , the lfe - induced interaction can be realized in any ultracold atomic or molecular gas @xcite .",
    "the lfe was not previously explored in two- and three - dimensional ( 2d and 3d ) settings , where it may give rise to new phenomenology in comparison with the recently investigated 1d case @xcite , as the lfe - induced interaction is determined by the underlying green s function , which has different forms in effectively 1d , 2d , and 3d geometries ( note that the above - mentioned  massive \" bec , with a large number of atoms @xmath14 , can be readily morphed into a low - dimensional shape @xcite ) . in particular , we demonstrate here that solitary vortices , alias vortex annuli ( vas ) , readily self - trap in the 2d setting .",
    "vortices in bec are essential for simulating various effects from condensed matter @xcite , and as building blocks of quantum turbulence @xcite .",
    "they also help to emulate gravitational physics @xcite , and find applications , such as phase qubits @xcite and matter - wave sagnac interferometers for testing the rotational - equivalence principle you , luo . as mentioned above , atomic - matter vortices can store and release information delivered by optical vortex beams @xcite .",
    "the stabilization of vas with large values of the topological charge ( vorticity ) @xmath0 , which is required for deterministic creation of vortices @xcite and for applications ( in particular , the storage of higher - order optical vortices in the form of their atomic counterparts ) , is a challenging issue @xcite . under repulsive interactions , vortices supported by a nonzero background are stable solely for @xmath15 , while vortices with @xmath16 split into ones with @xmath15 fet . for the above - mentioned applications , most relevant",

    "exotic \" settings , with the local strength of the repulsive nonlinearity in the space of dimension @xmath21 growing with distance @xmath22 from the center faster than @xmath23 @xcite , or making use of a combination of a trapping potential and a _ spatially localized _ attractive interaction @xcite .    in this work , we introduce a 2d hybrid system consisting of a pseudo - spinor bec whose two components are coupled by a mw field through a magnetic - dipole transition .",
    "the system gives rise to _ stable _ giant vas , i.e. , ones with _",
    "_  arbitrarily high _ _ values of @xmath0 ( the stability checked up to @xmath3 ) .",
    "this is as well possible in the presence of additional contact repulsive interactions . on the other hand , under the action of an attractive contact interaction , with strength @xmath5 , which drives the critical collapse in the 2d geometry @xcite ,",
    "the vas exist and are stable , respectively , for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we demonstrate , by means of analytical and numerical considerations , that @xmath26 linearly grows with @xmath0 , thus making higher - order vortices _ more robust _ than lower - order ones , opposite to what is known in few other models capable to support stable higher - order vas @xcite .",
    "it is relevant to mention that the concept of giant vortices is known in the usual bec settings with the contact repulsion @xcite , where they are not self - trapped objects , i.e. , they are not vas .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model is introduced in section ii , numerical and analytical results are collected in section iii , and the paper is concluded by section iv .",
    "as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we consider a nearly-2d ( pancake - shaped ) binary bec composed of two different hyperfine states of the same atomic species , which is described by the two - component ( pseudo - spinor ) wave function , @xmath27 , with each component emulating  spin - up \" and  spin - down \" states .",

    "( [ helmholtz ] ) may be omitted in comparison with the first term ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , reducing eq .",
    "( [ helmholtz ] ) to the poisson equation for the scalar field : @xmath51because the medium s magnetization , which is the source of the magnetic field , is concentrated in the pancake , the poisson equation may be treated as one in the 2d plane .",
    "them using the green s function of the 2d poisson equation , the magnetic field is given by * *  * * @xmath52 * *  * * where @xmath53  is a background magnetic field of the mw , @xmath54 is the number of atoms , and @xmath55  is the set of 2d coordinates normalized by the transverse confinement size @xmath56 .",

    "the vorticity may be imparted to the trapped condensate by a vortical optical beam @xcite .",
    "if collisions between atoms belonging to the two components are considered ( with the corresponding strength of the contact interaction tunable by dint of the feshbach resonance @xcite ) , the additional cross - cubic terms can be absorbed into rescaled coefficient @xmath5 .",
    "collisions may also give rise to self - interaction terms , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , in the parentheses of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : final - down ] ) and ( eq : final - up ) , respectively . on the other hand , the same equations with @xmath70",

    "<S> stable self - trapped vortex annuli ( vas ) with large values of topological charge @xmath0 ( _ giant vas _ ) are not only a subject of fundamental interest , but are also sought for various applications , such as quantum information processing and storage . however , in conventional atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) vas with @xmath1 are unstable . here , we demonstrate that robust self - trapped fundamental solitons ( with @xmath2 ) and bright vas ( with the stability checked up to @xmath3 ) , can be created in the free space by means of the local - field effect ( the feedback of the bec on the propagation of electromagnetic waves ) in a condensate of two - level atoms coupled by a microwave ( mw ) field , as well as in a gas of mw - coupled fermions with spin @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental solitons and vas remain stable in the presence of an arbitrarily strong repulsive contact interaction ( in that case , the solitons are constructed analytically by means of the thomas - fermi approximation ) . under the action of the attractive contact interaction with strength @xmath5 , which , by itself , would lead to collapse , the fundamental solitons and vas exist and are stable , respectively , at @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> accurate analytical approximations are found for both @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with @xmath12 growing linearly with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , higher - order vas are _ more robust _ than their lower - order couterparts , on the contrary to what is known in other systems that may support stable self - trapped vortices </S>",
    "<S> . conditions for the experimental realizations of the vas are discussed . </S>"
