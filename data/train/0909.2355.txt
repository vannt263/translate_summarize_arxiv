    "magnetic fields in the sun and partially convective stars ( e.g. , g , k stars and possibly early m dwarfs ) are produced by the so - called @xmath5 dynamo mechanism operating at the interface between the convective envelope and the radiative core , where differential rotation is strongest , known as the tachocline .",
    "the action of differential rotation on a weak poloidal field at the base of the convective zone results in a large - scale and predominantly toroidal sub - surface field produced by this dynamo action @xcite .",
    "however , when this toroidal field emerges through the surface of the sun , the magnetic flux tubes are oriented in a primarially radial direction in the photosphere ( e.g. see the review by solanki 2009 ) .    stars with masses below @xmath0  m@xmath6 ( @xmath7m3 ) are expected to be fully convective as suggested by standard models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this limit probably shifts toward lower masses due to the influence of the magnetic field @xcite . in fully convective stars",
    ", the lack of a radiative core is expected to preclude the @xmath5 dynamo , maintained by the combined action of differential rotation ( @xmath8 effect ) and cyclonic convection ( @xmath3 effect ) .",
    "this raises the question of what type of dynamo produces strong magnetic activity as observed in mid to late m and brown dwarfs from photospheric zeeman splitting @xcite to chromospheric h@xmath3 and ca  ii  irt @xcite , coronal x - ray @xcite , and radio @xcite emissions .",
    "an alternative dynamo known as the so - called @xmath9 dynamo maintained by convection alone was proposed @xcite .",
    "it has been developed for fully convective pre - main sequence stars @xcite and late m dwarfs and brown dwarfs @xcite . in general , these models predict large - scale fields , and magnetic field detections are now known for a number of active objects in these groups @xcite .",
    "however , the models disagree with each other on the magnetic field morphology and they disagree with the results from some phase - resolved spectropolarimetric observations @xcite .",
    "for example , the latest dynamo simulations @xcite sucessfully predict that the magnetic fields possess large - scale fields with a lack of differential rotation in rapidly rotating m dwarfs .",
    "however , the simulations predict the field morphology in fully convective stars should be mostly toroidal , whereas results of @xcite and @xcite show dominantly poloidal fields in 5 m3-m4.5 dwarfs .    in this paper , we present our mapping of the m4 dwarf g  164 - 31 based on 20 hours of spectropolarimetric observations spread over 3 successive nights . to date , there are only two m4 dwarfs ( v374 peg , @xcite ; g  164 - 31 , this paper ) that have been densely monitored over only a few rotation cycles so as to preclude intrinsically long - term magnetic variability , which can affect the mapping result .",
    "in addition , for the first time a synthetic spectrum fitting technique @xcite is applied for measuring the mean field strength and the filling factor in g  164 - 31 .",
    "together , the polarimetric field mapping and the mean field measurements provide us a better accounting of both large- and small - scale fields in one of these two rapid rotators .",
    "we also present our zeeman signature search in stokes v for 5 other m - dwarfs with spectral types ranging from m0 to m4.5 : gl 890 ( m0v ) , lhs 473 ( m2.5v ) , kp tau ( m3v ) , gl 896b ( m4.5v ) and 2e  4498 ( m4.5v ) .",

    "exposure times were computed using the exposure time calculator for espadons to obtain signal - to - noise ratios above 100 at the wavelengths of interest .",
    "this signal - to - noise value is typical of what is needed to detect the circular polarization in m dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the case of g  164 - 31",
    ", we monitored the star for a total of 20 hours from 2008 march 23 to 26 with 33 observations , aiming to cover at least one full rotation period of the star .",

    "the photospheric field strength is estimated from lsd stokes @xmath34 and @xmath44 profiles , and the chromospheric field is computed from the stokes profiles of only the h@xmath3 line .    for g  164 - 31",

    "we thus conclude that the rotation period of this dwarf is 12.96  hours .",
    "we note that this value is slightly greater than the estimated maximum rotation period of 12.1  hours for this star .",
    "the difference is possibly due to g  164 - 31 having a larger radius than the expected value from theory . matching unpolarized ( stokes  @xmath34 )",

    "it is unlikely that i exactly equals @xmath56 , and the results obtained in the imaging process decribed below are similar for @xmath57 .",
    "we thus set @xmath58 , which results in the g  164 - 31 radius being @xmath738@xmath59 larger than the typical value for m dwarfs of the same luminosity .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that g  164 - 31 is a young object belonging to a moving cluster identified by @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to   5 for further discussion .",
    "we monitored g  164 - 31 for 20 hours spread over three successive nights , aiming for coverage over a full rotational cycle .",
    "the true period ( 12.96  hours ) is a bit longer than our expected maximum value ( 12.1 hours ) . with this period ,",
    "our observations cover only half of the rotational phase .",
    "in other words , only half of the stellar surface was monitored .",

    "figure  [ f2 ] and [ f3 ] show stokes @xmath34 and @xmath44 lsd profiles of g  164 - 31 .",
    "to reconstruct the map of cool spots and magnetic fields at the surface of g  164 - 31 from the set of observed lsd stokes @xmath34 and @xmath44 , we use the @xcite magnetic mapping code which employes the zeeman - doppler imaging ( zdi ) technique @xcite . the typical longitude resolution achieved at the equator",
    "is @xmath60 or @xmath61 rotation cycle .",
    "the basic idea of the code has been fully described in several papers @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we briefly describe the principles of the modeling work and refer the reader to the above papers for further details .",
    "cool spots on the surface of a rapidly rotating star produce distortions in the stellar spectral lines .",
    "if the star is rotating fast enough ( at least 20 - 30 km  s@xmath15 for late - type dwarfs , @xcite ) , the shape of the star s spectral line profiles are dominated by rotational doppler broadening . in this case , there is a strong correlation between the position of any distortion within a line profile and the position of the corresponding spot on the stellar surface .",
    "a spectrum of the rapid rotator is a one - dimensional image that is resolved in the direction perpendicular to the stellar rotation axis and the light - of - sight . by observing the star at different rotation phases , a two - dimensional image of the spot distribution",
    "can be reconstructed using the so - called doppler imaging ( di ) technique ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in the imaging process , the stellar surface is divided into a grid of 1000 elementary cells . using the spot - occupancy model of @xcite , the local line profile at each grid point of the surface",
    "is described as a linear combination of two reference profiles , one representing the quiet photosphere and one for cool spots .",
    "both reference profiles are assumed to be equal and only differ by their relative continuum levels .",
    "for the assumed reference profile , we can use either the lsd profile of the very slowly rotating inactive m4 dwarf gl  402 or a simple gaussian profile with similar full width at half - maximum and equivalent width .",
    "both options yield very similar results , indicating that the exact shape of the assumed local profiles has very minor impact on the reconstructed images , as long as the rotational velocity of the star is much larger than the local profile .",
    "each element on the surface is quantified by the local fraction occupied by spots .",
    "the spot occupancy ranges from 0 ( no spots ) to 1 ( complete spot coverage ) . the maximum entropy image reconstruction technique @xcite is used to find the image having the smoothest variation ( or in some sense the simplest image ) , giving the least contrast between spots and the quiet photosphere .",
    "the field is described as the sum of a poloidal and a toroidal component , both expressed as spherical harmonics expansions ( @xcite ) . for a given set of the complex coefficients of the spherical harmonic expansions",
    ", one can produce a corresponding topology ( or a stokes @xmath44 data set ) at the stellar surface .",
    "the code uses the maximum entropy image reconstruction technique , in which entropy ( i.e. , quantifying the amount of reconstructed information ) is calculated from the coefficients of the spherical harmonics expansions .",
    "the imaging process starts from a null magnetic field and iteratively adjusts the spherical harmonic coefficients in order to match the synthetic stokes @xmath44 profile to the observed lsd one .",
    "the code uses a multidirectional search in the image space until the required maximum entropy image is obtained .",
    "this corresponds to an optimal field topology that reproduces the data at a given @xmath62 level , i.e. , usually down to noise level .",
    "since the inversion problem is partially ill posed , we use the entropy function to select the magnetic field map with lowest information content among all those reproducing the data equally well .    to calculate the synthetic stokes @xmath44 profiles for a given field topology",
    ", the surface was again divided into a grid of 1000 elementary surface cells . in each cell , the three components ( radial , azimuthal and meridional in spherical coordinates ) of the vector field are estimated directly from the spherical harmonic expansion .",
    "the code uses the analytic solutions @xcite of unno - rachkovsky s radiative transfer equations to calculate the contribution to the stokes @xmath44 profiles of all visible cells at each observed rotation phase .",
    "the free parameters in the unno - rachkovsky equations are obtained by fitting the lsd stokes @xmath34 profile of a very slowly rotating and weakly active star with a similar spectral type ( e.g. , gl 402 ) . to obtain the best fit ( in both amplitude and width ) between the synthetic and observed stokes @xmath44 profiles",
    ", the code introduces a filling factor @xmath63 , which represents the fractional amount of circular flux being constant over the whole stellar surface , and speculates that large - scale fields in m dwarfs can be structured on a small scale @xcite .",
    "the circularly polarized flux from each cell is thus @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the stokes @xmath44 profile derived from the analytic solutions of the unno - rachkovsky equations .",
    "differential rotation is also implemented in the calculation process of the synthetic stokes v profiles for yielding the best fits to the observation . for this purpose , we assume the rotation rate varies with latitude , @xmath66 , following a solar - like differential rotation law as @xmath67  sin@xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the angular rotation rate at the equator , and @xmath70 is the difference in angular rotation rate between the equator and the pole .",
    "differential rotation is detected when @xmath62 of the fit to the data shows a well defined minimum in the range of @xmath69 and @xmath70 values . in the case of g  164 - 31",
    ", we did not obtain a clear minimum in the explored @xmath69 @xmath71 @xmath70 range .",
    "this indicates that our data are not suitable for measuring differential rotation given the fairly simple ( and low amplitude ) rotational modulation of the stokes  @xmath44 profiles we observe .",
    "this is mostly due to the fact that the field distribution lacks well defined features at different latitudes from which differential rotation can be estimated .",
    "based on the previous observations of analogs of g  164 - 31 @xcite , we therefore assumed that this star rotates as a rigid body while performing the field mapping .",
    "the obtained map of g  164 - 31 is shown in figure  [ f4 ] .",
    "figure  [ f4 ] presents our maps of the spot occupancy and the magnetic field at the stellar surface of g  164 - 31 . for the half stellar surface that was not observed ,",
    "the field topology has been derived using a spherical harmonic expansion based on the collected stokes @xmath44 data set .",
    "our brightness map shows a low contrast spot at the pole of the star .",
    "the magnetic field morphology on g  164 - 31 shows that the radial field component is dominant , which appears similar to what is seen in v374  peg .",
    "the azimuthal and meridional components are negligible .",
    "the average large - scale flux is 680  g and the poloidal field dominates with 99@xmath59 of the energy content .",
    "most ( 95@xmath59 ) of this poloidal field is stored in the mode corresponding to a dipole aligned with the rotation axis ( spherical harmonics degree @xmath72 and order @xmath73 ) .",
    "one should note that due to the high @xmath13sin@xmath31 of g  164 - 31 , for any value of the filling factor @xmath74 , we find similar results .",
    "hence , we arbitrarily set @xmath75 .",
    "we also examine the binarity of g  164 - 31 .",
    "based on the lsd stokes @xmath34 profiles , we find an average radial velocity value of @xmath76  km  s@xmath15 .",
    "no significant variation in radial velocity is found .",
    "therefore , our current data does not reveal any hint of an additional close - in component around g  164 - 31 .",
    "in this section , we first briefly discuss the magnetic field properties of the stars whose fields are not mapped .",
    "these stars are gl  890 , lhs  473 , kp  tau , gl  896b and 2e  4498 .",
    "we then focus the discussion on the field topology in the photosphere and the chromosphere of g  164 - 31 .",
    "we did not detect zeeman signatures in gl  890 and lhs 473 .",
    "for the latter case , the non - detection in both the photosphere and the chromosphere indicates that lhs  473 is inactive , likely due to its low @xmath13sin@xmath31 , and this result is consistent with previous observations showing its low coronal activity level .",
    "however in the fastly rotating case of gl  890 , the non - detection suggests that the field topology on this star may be different from what has been observed in more slowly - rotating early - m dwarfs @xcite , whose fields are large - scale and dominantly toroidal producing stokes  v signatures detectable at any time .",
    "since the detections of x - ray and radio emission indicate that gl  890 is magnetically active , phase - resolved spectropolarimetric observations of this star are therefore needed to clarify its magnetic field topology .",
    "for the three remaining m dwarfs , all these fast rotators show zeeman signatures , and they are particularly strong in gl  896b and 2e  4498 ( fig .",
    "this result indicates the presence of strong , large - scale fields on these stars . since kp  tau ( 0.31  m@xmath6 ) and 2e  4498 ( 0.21  m@xmath6 ) are fully convective , they are good targets for studying the field morphology by carrying out spectropolarimetric and simultaneous multiple - wavelength observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we note that gl  896bab is an unresolved binary .",
    "therefore , its zeeman signature is contributed by two components if both are magnetically active .",
    "the g  164 - 31 magnetic field topology , which is mostly poloidal with most of the magnetic energy concentrated within the lowest order axisymmetric modes , is very similar to what has been observed in v374  peg @xcite and other mid - m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the average large - scale magnetic flux on g  164 - 31 is 0.68  kg , which is significantly smaller than the previous measurements of few kilogauss magnetic fluxes in active mid - m dwarfs using synthetic spectrum fitting techniques ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is possibly due to the zdi technique being sensitive to only large - scale and simple structures , while zeeman signatures from magnetic regions with complicated or small - scale topology may cancel each other in circularly polarized spectra whereas these signatures add up in unpolarized spectra . to explore this  missing \" magnetic flux",
    ", we used the synthetic spectrum fitting technique described in @xcite to measure the mean magnetic flux on the surface of g  164 - 31 .",
    "briefly , spectra in the wavelength interval around the zeeman - sensitive fe  i line at 8468.40     are analyzed . in stars as cool as g  164 - 31",
    ", this line is actually blended with a ti  i line at 8468.47     which is similar in strength and also zeeman sensitive . the spectrum synthesis models both lines plus numerous tio lines in this wavelength region .",
    "because of the ubiquitous tio , spectral changes due to magnetic fields are seen more clearly in the ratio of active to inactive line profiles .",
    "therefore , spectra of g  164 - 31 were divided by inactive references . in our case , we used two inactive reference stars gj  725b ( or lhs  59 , m3.5v ) and gj  876 ( or lhs  530 , m4v ) which are meant to be identical in all respects ( @xmath77 , log@xmath78 , [ m / h ] , etc . ) to g  164 - 31 except for the field .",
    "line profiles were synthesized with and without magnetic fields ( see @xcite and references therein ) and the ratio of active to inactive profiles was fit by adjusting the magnetic field strength , @xmath79 , and its filling factor , @xmath80 , in the model spectrum of g  164 - 31 .",
    "the line profiles are generated assuming a uniform radial field everywhere with a uniform filling factor .",
    "the best fits were obtained with @xmath81  kg and @xmath82  kg for gj  725b and gj  876 .",
    "the fit to the observations using gj  876 as the inactive reference star is shown in figure 5 . due to the high @xmath13sin@xmath31 of g  164 - 31",
    ", we can not measure @xmath79 and @xmath80 separately .",
    "the model fit in the line core is not as good as we would like , and is only slightly improved using gj  725b as the reference star .",
    "we note though that if the radius of g  164 - 31 is indeed larger than expected due to youth ( see below ) , its gravity is likely somewhat lower than that of either inactive comparison star .",
    "our spectrum synthesis indicates that the 8468     feature should actually weaken somewhat at lower gravity , which would result in the discrepancy in the core getting worse by @xmath83 in the ratio . a possible way to correct for",
    "this would be to fit a distribution of magnetic field strengths on the stellar surface as has been done for m dwarfs ( johns  krull & valenti 2000 ) and on t tauri stars ( e.g. johns  krull et al .",
    "the current fit ( fig .",
    "5 ) attempts to use a single field strength to fit both the wings and the core , whereas a distribution of magnetic fields gives more flexibility in fitting the entire profile and can result in bigger changes in the line equivalent width than produced when using only a single field value .",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath84  kg for g  164 - 31 as the best estimate from our single field fitting described above , noting that this may be a slight underestimate .",
    "this value for @xmath85 is larger than the one measured from the zdi technique by a factor of 4.7 .",
    "our result is consistent with the previous measurements from the literature ( e.g. , ev  lac , @xcite ) , suggesting that in active mid - m dwarfs a significant part of the magnetic energy is stored in small - scale structures . as found by @xcite , it appears that a large majority of the magnetic energy is stored in the small scale field of g  164 - 31 .",
    "apparently , a successful dynamo model should be able to produce both large - scale poloidal fields and small - scale features in rapidly rotating mid - m dwarfs .    to study chromospheric activity , we computed the h@xmath3 emission equivalent widths for each exposure .",
    "our h@xmath3 emission light curve is shown in fig .",
    "one should keep in mind that since each observation to obtain a stokes @xmath44 profile consists of 4 exposures , measuring h@xmath3 emission at individual exposures therefore increases time resolution of the light curve .",
    "figure  [ f6 ] also indicates that the h@xmath3 equivalent width variations are likely sinusoidal and they are modulated by the stellar rotation with @xmath86  day determined from the stokes  @xmath44 profiles .",
    "this effect has also been observed in late - m and brown dwarfs ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "flaring events were seen strongly in the last sequences of the first observing night and moderately in the middle sequences of the second night .",
    "these events were also observed in the h@xmath87 emission profiles . while the likely rotational modulation and nonzero minimum of the h@xmath3 light curve imply either a large - scale ( poloidal or toroidal ) chromospheric field or a localized concentration of small - scale magnetic activity , it is reasonable to assume that the chromospheric field in g  164 - 31 has both a large scale poloidal component and small - scale structures as observed in the photospheric field .",
    "this field configuration probably dominates in both the photosphere and the chromosphere of the star .",
    "we note that simultaneous observations at multiple wavelengths of the source will place more contraints on the chromospheric and coronal field morphology ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is very interesting to note that the radius of g  164 - 31 is at least 30@xmath59 larger than that estimated from standard models for m dwarfs at the same luminosity ( see   2.1.4 ) .",
    "there are two possible interpretations of this discrepancy .",
    "first , the magnetic field effects of reduced convective efficiency due to fast rotation and large field strengths , and/or to spot coverage as proposed by @xcite might yield a cooler effective temperature @xmath88 and thus a larger radius in low - mass stars , keeping their luminosity unchanged ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "our spot mapping ( fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) shows the fraction of the stellar surface covered by the low contrast spot is relatively small in g  164 - 31 .",
    "however , one should note that the imaging technique is only sensitive to spots or spot groups with sizes comparable to our resolution element .",
    "we therefore can not rule out the possibility of unresolved small spots spread everywhere on the stellar surface .",
    "hence , we can not conclude whether the effect due to spot coverage is significant in this star or not .",
    "observational results ( see @xcite and references therein ) suggest that these effects might yield a @xmath90 larger radius in g  164 - 31 , therefore the discrepancy in radius of over @xmath4 can not be explained by only those effects .",
    "second , we explore the possibility that g  164 - 31 is a young m4 dwarf , its radius thus larger than one computed for old m dwarfs .",
    "we note that the @xmath24-band absolute magnitude of g  164 - 31 , @xmath26 , is 0.67  mag brighter than the average value for m4 dwarfs - band absolute magnitude from trigonometric parallaxes and 2mass @xmath24-band magnitudes available in the vizier database .",
    "this work yielded an average value @xmath91 .",
    "] , supporting the young nature of the star . from a literature search , the binary system g  164 - 31 ( gl 490b)@xmath20 g  164 - 32 ( gl  490a ) indeed belongs to a moving cluster previously identified by @xcite ( for a review on young nearby stars , see @xcite )",
    "one should note that the primary component g  164 - 32 also exhibits high coronal x - ray emission with log(@xmath16/@xmath92)@xmath93 @xcite and chromospheric h@xmath3 emission @xcite , indicating activity typical in young early - m dwarfs .",
    "we measured an upper limit for the li  @xmath94 equivalent width of 17  m  for g  164 - 31 .",
    "this gives the star an age older than 10  myr since early - m dwarfs ( @xmath95m4 ) are expected to completely deplete their lithium within @xmath710  myr .",
    "we suggest g  164 - 31 is an analog of the m4 dwarf hip  112312a at 23.6  pc @xcite , which is a member of the @xmath712 myr old",
    "@xmath87 pictoris moving group @xcite .",
    "to estimate the mass and age of g  164 - 31 , we used the @xcite theoretical models with constraints of @xmath26 , @xmath96 , and the deduced radius @xmath97  r@xmath6 of g  164 - 31 , and we also considered the magnetic field effects that might yield about a 10 - 15@xmath59 larger radius .",
    "we then derived @xmath98  m@xmath6 at an age of about 25 - 30  myr , making g  164 - 31 the least massive m dwarf whose magnetic field has been mapped to date .",
    "more observations are needed to precisely determine the fundamental parameters of this moving cluster .",
    "based on our circularly polarized and unpolarized spectroscopic observations , using both tomographic imaging and synthetic spectrum fitting , we reveal the mainly axisymmetric large - scale poloidal magnetic field and the small - scale field structures storing a significant portion of the magnetic energy in the photosphere of the m4 dwarf g  164 - 31 .",
    "the modulation of the h@xmath3 emission light curve suggests that the field in the chromosphere is stable and possibly poloidal like that in the photosphere .",
    "our detection of circular polarization in the single and rapidingly rotating m dwarfs kp  tau ( m3v ) , 2e  4498 ( m4.5v ) make them good targets for mapping of the field morphology in mid - m dwarfs in the future .",
