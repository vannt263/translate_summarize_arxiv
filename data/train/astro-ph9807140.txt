    "the public availability of the hubble deep field ( hdf , williams et al 1996 ) has led to a surge of progress in our understanding of the faint galaxy population . the flatter slope ( @xmath4 ) of the optical counts beyond @xmath525 mag found from earlier deep ground - based studies ( lilly et al 1991 , metcalfe et al 1995 , smail et al 1995 ) has been confirmed from the hdf data .",
    "this flat slope , when combined with the relative paucity of @xmath6-dropouts ( which confirms that most of even the faintest optical sources have @xmath73 [ guhathakurta et al 1990 , lanzetta et al 1996 , connolly et al 1997 ] ) , implies the bulk of the extragalactic background light must have been produced at a relatively low redshift ( ellis 1997 ) .",
    "the hdf has also contributed much to our understanding of distant galaxy morphology .",
    "various authors ( abraham et al 1996a ; mobasher et al 1996 ; odewahn et al 1996 ; driver et al 1998 ) have used the hdf to extend the earlier medium deep survey morphological source counts ( glazebrook et al 1995 ; driver et al 1995 ; abraham et al 1996b ) to fainter limits , finding a surprisingly high fraction of the @xmath025 mag sources can not be categorised within the hubble sequence of regular systems .",
    "a key question is the physical nature of these sources and their present - day counterparts .",
    "another striking result from the hdf is the small angular sizes of the faintest sources , implying physical extents of only 2 - 4 @xmath8kpc . in a recent analysis ,",
    "bouwens et al ( 1997 ) suggest that such sizes can not be reconciled with the expected redshift and surface brightness dimming of typical @xmath71 sources and thus claim substantial physical growth and merging must have occurred for the galaxy population during the redshift range 1@xmath23 .",
    "the deep hdf data complement recent morphological studies by brinchmann et al ( 1998 ) , lilly et al ( 1998 ) and schade et al ( 1998 ) who have analysed the joint morphological - spectroscopic data obtained from a hst imaging survey of a subset of cfrs ( lilly et al 1995 ) and ldss ( ellis et al 1996 ) redshift surveys .",
    "they find strong evolutionary trends in a population of @xmath71 galaxies with irregular morphology but only modest changes in the abundance of large regular disc and spheroidal galaxies .",
    "it is not clear whether these trends are consistent with semi - analytical models based on hierarchical growth ( baugh , cole & frenk 1996 ) . for there to be a peak of star formation activity at @xmath91 - 2 ( madau 1997 ) , either the evolutionary behaviour of massive regular galaxies beyond @xmath91 must change dramatically from that observed for @xmath71 , or perhaps the trends delineated from the optical photometric data are underestimated because of complications such as dust extinction ( meurer et al 1997 ) .",
    "another important aspect of the hubble deep field is the ultra - deep spectroscopic follow - up survey work undertaken with the keck telescopes ( cowie 1997 , lowenthal et al 1997 , cohen et al 1996 ) .",
    "these surveys have confirmed the conclusions suggested by the photometric analyses above and raised confidence in the validity of photometric redshifts estimated from multicolour photometry alone ( ellis 1997 , hogg et al 1998 ) .    in this paper",
    "we wish to explore a new approach to the hdf data , somewhat related to the photometric redshift technique , but which exploits the true benefit of hst , namely its ability to _ resolve _ distant galaxies .",
    "rather than use the multicolour data to predict redshifts for distant sources , we instead explore the _ resolved multicolour data for galaxies of known redshift _ using spectral - synthesis models . for galaxies with @xmath101 , the 4-filter hdf colours are dominated by main sequence stars whose turn - off ages are less than 4 - 5 gyr .",
    "as the evolutionary history of such stars is well - understood , modulo the usual assumptions concerning the stellar initial mass function and chemical composition , the multicolour hdf data can be used to derive relative ages for physically distinct components of distant galaxies , test for the presence of dust and possibly address the puzzling nature of the irregular sources which appear with such abundance .",
    "this paper is primarily concerned with an initial application of our technique to a well - defined population of @xmath11 mag galaxies with redshifts drawn from bouwens et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "this sample constitutes the faintest statistically - complete spectroscopic redshift sample currently available in the hdf .",
    "the use of this sample has the benefits that ( a ) conclusions drawn from it can be compared to those of independent studies sampling the same magnitude and redshift range ( e.g. brinchmann et al 1997 ) ; and ( b ) by restricting our sample to relatively bright limits and moderate redshifts ( @xmath12=0.5 ) , we are working with galaxies that are well - resolved and can be described within the traditional framework of the hubble system .",
    "the scientific focus of the present paper is directed towards a better understanding of two contentious yet fundamental issues central to the origin of the hubble classification sequence : the relative ages of bulges and discs , and the formation history of elliptical galaxies .",
    "we will also use our synthesis results to place some constraints on the previous appearance of our galaxy sample .    in our own galaxy the observational evidence for early bulge formation seems established , mainly since the main tracers of bulge / halo populations ( eg . globular clusters and rr lyrae stars ) are known to be old .",
    "the notion that bulges form well before the discs in the first stage of galactic collapse is the essential component in both the original els scenario ( eggen , lynden - bell , & sandage 1962 ) and more modern variants ( eg .",
    "carney et al . 1990 ) .",
    "hierarchical galaxy formation scenarios also require old bulges formed by mergers ( eg .",
    "kauffmann , white , & guiderdoni 1993 ; baugh , cole & frenk 1996 ) , with visible discs built - up gradually from gas accreted onto these merger remnants .",
    "recently , however , the issue of the relative age of the bulge and disc in extragalactic systems has become controversial .",
    "n - body simulations indicate that bulges form naturally from bar instabilities in discs ( norman , sellwood , & hassan 1996 ; combes et al .",
    "1990 ) , and recent observations now seem to indicate that bulges display the morphological and dynamical characteristics of such a formation scenario ( eg .",
    "triaxiality or `` peanut '' shapes ( kuijken & merrifield 1995 ) , cylindrical rotation ( shaw 1993 ) , and disky kinematics ( kormendy 1992 ) . on the basis of model fits , de jong ( 1996 ) concludes that age is likely to be a dominant contributor to color gradients in local spirals .",
    "however extrapolation of colour gradients to the inner parts of the galaxies suggests that at least the inner discs _ can not be distinguished in terms of colour _ from bulges ( balcells & peletier 1994 ; de jong 1996 ) .",
    "this is perhaps somewhat surprising given the visual impression from `` true colour '' hst images of distant galaxies , in which bulges seem generally redder than disks even at quite small galactocentric radii ( van den bergh et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in another recent challenge of what",
    "had , hitherto , been regarded as a well - established viewpoint , kauffmann et al ( 1996 ) and zepf ( 1997 ) have introduced the possibility that elliptical galaxies are continuously formed from merging systems as expected in hierarchical models for the growth of structure , rather than formed at high redshift in a single burst of star formation ( c.f .",
    "baade 1957 ) . the observational evidence supporting the ` traditional ' view was based primarily on the small scatter in the colour - magnitude diagram of cluster ellipticals ( sandage & visvanathan 1978 , bower et al 1992 ) .",
    "this test has also been extended to higher redshift cluster samples with morphological classifications from hst ( ellis et al 1997 , stanford et al 1998 ) .",
    "unfortunately , as kauffmann ( 1996 ) points out , cluster samples are ill - suited to testing the hierarchical picture as they represent accelerated regions so far as structure growth is concerned .",
    "it is quite possible that most of the rich cluster ellipticals are truly old as their homogeneously distributed colours imply .",
    "the ultimate test of kauffmann et al s conjecture lies in the analysis of ellipticals in field samples .",
    "the currently - available samples are too small for robust results ( schade et al 1998 ) although zepf ( 1997 ) claims the absence of red objects at very faint limits in the hdf is consistent with hierarchical predictions .",
    "glazebrook et al ( 1998 ) have also claimed evidence for younger field ellipticals in data from the medium deep survey , on the basis of @xmath13 colours .    a plan of the paper follows .",
    "in @xmath142 we introduce the principles of our method for analysing spatially - resolved multicolour data , and outline the basic assumptions and the uncertainties associated with the technique . in @xmath143 we illustrate how the method works by analysing multicolour data for 3 hdf galaxies of known redshift . in @xmath144",
    "we introduce the bouwens et al sample and discuss its salient properties in the context of earlier morphological studies .",
    "we partition the sample into sources of ellipticals and spirals and explore the history of star formation for both types . utilising the statistical completeness of the bouwens et al sample",
    ", we use our derived star formation rates to calculate contributions to the volume averaged values and predict the recent past appearance of the various classes . in @xmath145",
    "we discuss our method more generally and explore briefly the prospects for validating our results and extending the work to higher redshift systems . in @xmath146 , we summarise our main results . unless stated otherwise , throughout this paper our adopted cosmology is one where , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "in general terms any age - dating of galaxies using broad - band photometry is affected by numerous complications including the age - metallicity degeneracy , possible effects of internal dust extinction and variations in the stellar initial mass function ( see renzini 1995 for a review ) . however",
    "the crucial advantage of resolved colour analyses is that they make possible studies of _ relative _ age and star - formation history of the components within galaxies , which as we will show are far more robust than absolute ages based upon integrated colours .",
    "furthermore , in the case of hdf galaxies , the significant look - back time to the distant sources selected for study means that age uncertainties have far less of an effect than would be the case in analysing the history of local stellar populations . _ our approach will thus be to focus more on the relative age distributions of stellar populations internal to galaxies of a given morphological type , rather than attempting to determine absolute ages .",
    "_ by weighting component age distributions with their stellar luminosities we hope to address more general questions such as the recent ( @xmath175 gyr ) star formation history of disc and spheroidal components .",
    "this is an important goal since , at @xmath90.5 , the previous 5 gyr spans the important redshift range @xmath72.5 .    to understand how 4-filter",
    "colour data can be used to place constraints on past star formation history , consider first a late - type spiral whose star formation history can be approximated by a constant star - formation rate . in reality",
    "the constant sfr is effectively a time - average over the appearance and disappearance of spatially distinct star forming regions , each of which can be considered as a simple stellar population with a lifetime ( before disruption or gas depletion ) which is short compared to the dynamical timescale of the galaxy . over time these young populations gradually mix with older generations of stars and assimilate into older galactic components .",
    "we will translate this qualitative picture for galaxy evolution into the quantitative language of spectral synthesis modelling ( charlot & bruzual 1991 ) .",
    "the emergent flux from a composite stellar system , @xmath18 , at time @xmath19 can be represented by the convolution of the spectrum of an evolving instantaneous starburst , @xmath20 with an assumed star - formation rate ( sfr ) function @xmath21 :    @xmath22    @xmath23 term is known given a stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and metallicity from libraries of template stellar spectra and evolutionary isochrones .",
    "for a given star - formation history an age track can be constructed on a colour - colour diagram using equation 1 . when treating galaxies as point sources the integrated colours define a single position on a colour - colour diagram , and given the uncertainties in the assumed values for @xmath21 , the imf and metallicity , unique stellar ages can not be derived .",
    "since galaxies are not generally homogenous systems with a single age and star - formation history , _ when they are spatially resolved we can expect a dispersion of points on colour - colour diagrams_. the important point we explore in this paper is whether the nature of this dispersion can be used to overcome many of the ambiguities inherent in equation 1 .",
    "for example , the distribution of pixel by pixel colours within a galaxy image is a record of the manner in which the stellar population has been assembled ( eg . via numerous small bursts , or by a smaller number of larger bursts ) .",
    "we expect resolved sites of active star formation to approximate instantaneous starbursts and therefore @xmath21 to be a @xmath24-function , effectively breaking the convolution degeneracy in equation 1 . in practice , therefore , the distribution of pixel colours should directly trace the shape of @xmath25 for a set of ages .",
    "model colour - colour age tracks for the hdf filter set were computed using the gissel96 spectral synthesis code of charlot & bruzual ( 1991;1996;1998 ) . for convenience , in our modelling",
    ", we assumed a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) with low and high mass cut - offs of 0.1 @xmath26 and 125 @xmath26 respectively ( this latter cut - off is fixed in the standard gissel96 distribution ) .",
    "we also assumed that the colours of individual pixels can be modelled using exponential star - formation histories with characteristic timescale @xmath27 , ie .",
    "@xmath28 , which is often used to model the integrated colours of galaxies ( kennicutt 1991 ) .",
    "this allows a fairly generic parameterization of the star formation history , since as @xmath29 this model approximates constant star formation , while @xmath30 approximates an instantaneous burst .",
    "this exponential form is clearly an important assumption , but we would like to emphasize two points .",
    "firstly , if the assumed form is correct then we expect the dispersion in galaxy colours to scatter along the predictions of exponential @xmath21 tracks , which is in fact generally seen in our data .",
    "the second point is that exponential star formation histories for individual pixels _ do not _ necessarily result in a global exponential star - formation history for the galaxy considered as a whole ( ie .",
    "when the total light from all pixels is superposed ) , unless the galaxy is coeval with a universal star - formation history applying to all pixels .",
    "representative colour - colour tracks for stellar populations seen at various redshifts with different assumed star formation histories and metallicities are shown in figure 1 .",
    "arrows at the corners of the panels illustrate the effects of foreground - screen dust extinction in the host galaxy with rest - frame value @xmath31 mag , assuming galactic , smc , and local starburst extinction curves ( pei 1992 , calzetti 1997 ) . taken together , the panels in this figure illustrate how the colour - colour tracks change as the result of varying the star - formation timescale , dust content , and metallicity of the models .",
    "the colour vs. age tracks on the colour - colour diagrams , @xmath32 , have four free parameters : age @xmath19 , star formation history e - folding timescale @xmath27 , metallicity @xmath33 , and dust extinction @xmath34 ( parameterized in terms of relative optical extinction in the rest frame ) , i.e. @xmath32 is shorthand for @xmath35 .",
    "prior to fitting pixel - by - pixel colours to these models , all galaxy images were re - registered to sub - pixel accuracy .",
    "this was accomplished by calculating offsets between the different bands ( in the version 2 stacked images provided by stsci ) by cross correlating the images , and then resampling to remove the subpixel positioning errors with spline interpolation    for each pixel in the galaxy image , we compute the optimum evolutionary track using a maximum likelihood estimator @xmath36 that is effectively least - squares :    @xmath37    where the product is over the four colours , and @xmath38 $ ] are the data colours and errors in the pixel ( determined using the formulae in williams et al .",
    "appropriate ranges to maximise the likelihood within were determined from simple astrophysical constraints . in the next section",
    "we describe these astrophysical constraints , and describe in a general way the effects of varying the model parameters .",
    "unsurprisingly , figure 1 indicates that the exponential star - formation timescale @xmath27 ( which will be given in units of gyr throughout this paper ) is the dominant parameter controlling the colour of an evolving stellar population ( tinsley 1980 ) .",
    "the separation between the tracks for the hdf filter set is most pronounced for redshifts @xmath39 , so the techniques described in the present paper are optimized for non - local galaxies when using the hdf filter set . as expected , tracks corresponding to large values of @xmath27 ( effectively constant star - formation ) predict roughly constant colour indices at all ages for all redshifts .",
    "greater trends are seen for evolving populations with decreasing star - formation timescales .    for models with long and short @xmath27",
    ", our sensitivity to the past history becomes less precise .",
    "clearly the evolution in colour is greatest over intermediate values of @xmath27 , and over ages corresponding to the main sequence lifetimes sampled in the hdf filter set . in practice ,",
    "the colours are not very sensitive to age changes beyond 5 gyr . for local samples",
    "this is a major deficiency in understanding the history of galaxy formation ( bower et al 1992 ) .",
    "however , at a look - back time corresponding to @xmath100.5 , the range in stellar ages probed is particularly useful if , as seems likely , the bulk of the star formation in the universe occurred at @xmath91.5 ( madau et al 1997 ) .    at the other extreme , as @xmath27 approaches 100  myr ,",
    "the tracks also become degenerate as @xmath27 becomes comparable with the main - sequence lifetimes of the massive stars which dominate the rest - frame ultraviolet flux .",
    "this is an important characteristic implying that those populations evolving with timescales @xmath40 years move along tracks similar in shape to those of individual star clusters whose formation timescales are @xmath4110@xmath42 years ; in practice the evolution of star clusters can be modeled as instantaneous starbursts , cf .",
    "meurer et al .",
    "however an effective lower limit on @xmath27 is imposed by the resolution of hst , since the wfpc-2 pixel size of @xmath43 corresponds to @xmath44 kpc at @xmath45 and thus individual star - clusters are not resolved .",
    "the effective limit is given by the speed at which information can travel across a resolution element . making the conservative assumption that information from shocks and winds within a star - formation complex propagates along the igm at speeds @xmath46 over distances @xmath47kpc , in the present paper we adopt a minimum timescale of @xmath48 years .",
    "therefore , for the maximum likelihood analysis in this paper we explored the range @xmath49 gyr , sampled finely at intervals @xmath50 gyr .",
    "the three extinction laws adopted in figure 1 predict markedly different dust vectors .",
    "because of this , a strong variation in galaxian internal colour originating mostly from dust extinction , as opposed to age , is difficult to rule out in any individual object .",
    "indeed , it is usually the case that for any individual galaxy an appropriate combination of attenuation strength and extinction law can be chosen in order for dust obscuration to mimic the colour variations predicted by a range in ages .",
    "fortunately , this is not true for our galaxy samples considered as a whole because a general `` dust - age degeneracy '' would require fine - tuning in the choice of extinction law and attenuation strength as a function of redshift .",
    "we might also assume that any dust present in distant galaxies would be distributed similarly to that in local systems , at least for systems with regular appearance .",
    "if , as is the case locally , dust is not distributed uniformly on scales larger than a few kiloparsecs , then for pixels corresponding to physically large features , scatter in the colours along the direction of predicted dust vectors might be taken as a sign of extinction , while uniform colours can be taken as a sign of generally low dust content . since ( as will be shown ) the scatter in the internal colours of the galaxies studied in this paper is mostly along the predicted age tracks , dust is likely to be playing a subsidiary role in defining the internal galaxian colours .",
    "( the availability of both @xmath51 and @xmath52 provides an important constraint given the significant redshifts for most of our galaxies , and the sharply rising dust extinction in the uv . )    in addition to these general considerations which apply to the sample as a whole , we have also chosen to incorporate dust explicitly as a free parameter in our maximum - likelihood analysis , using the extinction law of calzetti ( 1997 ) .",
    "we chose to consider only the single calzetti law in our maximum - likelihood analysis as a compromise between choosing to neglect dust completely , which we felt to be rather unrealistic in spite of the general considerations described earlier , and choosing to allow complete freedom in the choice of extinction law , which would enormously complicate the analysis . in the future more solid constraints on the dust content ( and appropriate extinction law ) may be obtained by augmenting the star - formation histories inferred from the present analysis with integrated @xmath53 and @xmath54band fluxes ( cowie 1997 , dickinson et al 1998 ) or their resolved equivalents using nicmos .",
    "future data may also help to constrain the geometry of the dust extinction .",
    "the present paper assumes extinction can be modelled using a patchy foreground screen , which we adopted purely for the sake of simplicity , although it should also be noted that calzetti ( 1997 ) argues that a foreground screen model gives a somewhat better representation of the extinction in starburst galaxies than does a mixed dust model .      the age - metallicity degeneracy that is a common characteristic of colour - colour diagrams for early - type galaxies and globular clusters is evident in the tracks shown in figure 1 . in the context of the present paper , where many of the stellar populations being studied are rather young , the degeneracy is less troublesome . for young populations studied in the rest - frame uv , the observable light is dominated by luminous stars at the high mass end of the imf .",
    "such stars are less sensitive to metallicity variations ( as seen in figure 1 ) and thus , for the first few gyr , modest metallicity variations can not mask a large range in ages .    for ages @xmath55 gyr metallicity gradients",
    "_ can _ in principle play an important role in defining the internal colours of galaxies .",
    "in addition , although our synthesis models do incorporate post - ms contributions , it is possible that a uv excess attributed by us to younger stellar populations could represent some deficiency in the treatment of post - ms phases as has been the case for nearby ellipticals ( charlot , worthey , & bressan 1996 ) . as was the case with local data , however , the spatial resolution of the uv light is a key discriminant between young and old stellar populations .    throughout the remainder of this paper",
    "we will explore metallicity variations by restricting consideration to a fixed set of metallicities appropriate for local hubble sequence galaxies : 30% solar , solar , and 150% solar .      in summary ,",
    "our methodology is based on three key assumptions : ( 1 ) gissel96 models with exponential star formation histories accurately model the colours of individual pixels on galaxy images .",
    "( 2 ) dust extinction can be parameterized by patchy foreground screen extinction using the calzetti ( 1997 ) dust law .",
    "( 3 ) metallicity lies in the range 30% solar - 150% solar .",
    "the first assumption can be justified internally from the data given the qualitatively good agreement between the scatter in pixel - by - pixel colours and the shapes of exponential star formation history tracks .",
    "the agreement between this dispersion and the models also suggest that dust plays a subsidiary role in the distribution of galaxian internal colours ( at least at the moderate redshifts explored in this paper ) , although no attempt will be made to constrain the detailed form of the dust law from our data .",
    "the final assumption simply corresponds to metallicity lying within a reasonable large range of values representative of those seen in local hubble sequence galaxies .",
    "figures 24 show results , based upon the colour - colour tracks introduced in @xmath142 , for three hdf galaxies subjected to our internal colour - colour analysis .",
    "these examples have been taken from the statistically - complete sample given in table 1 of bouwens et al ( 1997 ) , and illustrate the types of conclusions ( and their associated uncertainties ) we can derive concerning the past star formation history of resolved high - redshift galaxies .",
    "we discuss these examples individually here , and defer discussion of the entire sample until @xmath144 . throughout the remainder of this paper objects",
    "will be referred to using the identifications given in the williams et al .",
    "( 1996 ) hdf catalogue .",
    "figure 2 [ middle left ] shows the @xmath57 colour image of a bright ( @xmath58=19.7 mag ) spiral at @xmath56=0.517 in the hdf ( hdf-3.610 , the third galaxy in bouwens et al s table 1 ) .",
    "the galaxy has been isolated from the background sky by selecting all contiguous pixels within a surface brightness threshold of @xmath52=26.0 mag arcsec@xmath59 . an important consideration in selecting the isophote and",
    "the optimum filter is to ensure a minimum signal / noise per pixel over all wavebands . on the one hand ,",
    "as our eventual sample is @xmath60-selected , it might seem appropriate to select the isophote at a longer wavelength . however , this would bias the pixels selected to those less sensitive to recent star formation and in many cases there would be inadequate signal in the shorter wavelength filters . were the pixels to be selected according to their @xmath6-band signal / noise , undue preference might be given to strong sf regions particularly for the higher redshift galaxies .",
    "we experimented with selection in both the @xmath61 and @xmath62 bands and found no great difference between the results .",
    "in most cases the colour error for each pixel selected according to these criteria is better than 0.2 - 0.3 mag .    in the top two panels of figure 2 , colour - colour distribution of pixels in the two possible planes ( @xmath57 vs. @xmath63 and @xmath57 vs. @xmath64 )",
    "are compared with the predictions of solar - metallicity , _ dust - free _ ( @xmath65 ) evolutionary tracks .",
    "the tracks shown are purely for illustration  in the full maximum - likelihood analysis the tracks are more finely sampled and dust content is a free variable . also for illustrative purposes , the colours of pixels in the central region of the galaxy",
    "have been coded with red points in the colour - colour plots . for this galaxy",
    "the majority of the points lie well within the locus of the @xmath57 vs @xmath63 colour space mapped by the tracks , although some red outliers ( corresponding to low signal - to - noise points ) lie redward of the tracks . on the other hand",
    "the majority of points lie slightly systematically redward of the predicted @xmath57 vs @xmath64 tracks , suggestive of mild dust extinction .",
    "a crucial point is that the _ dispersion _ in colour - colour space is in excellent agreement with the direction predicted by an age gradient along the colour - colour tracks .",
    "this is a generic feature of the galaxies in the present sample , even amongst those objects that show small systematic offsets from the model tracks ( most  but not all  of which can be accounted for by pockets of calzetti extinction law dust obscuration ) ..    best fitting age , @xmath34 and @xmath27 maps from the full maximum - likelihood analysis are shown in figure 2 as separate panels .",
    "parameter ranges are keyed to the vertical colour scale . from an examination of figure 2",
    "it is clear that this @xmath56=0.517 spiral has a bulge which is distinctly redder in all colours and considerably older than that of the disc .",
    "more accurately , the optical colours of the disc reflect ongoing star formation in the past 5 gyr whereas there is no evidence that this has been the case for the bulge .",
    "it is , of course , not possible to eliminate the possibility that the disc also contains an underlying population of red stars coeval with those of the bulge ; its visibility would be difficult to detect given the abundant population of younger stars .",
    "two points emerge from this restriction .",
    "foremost , the relative visibility of the disc and bulge components in the era 1@xmath22 just prior to the epoch of observations , will not be affected .",
    "secondly , the amount of mass involved in an early population could be constrained from near - infrared luminosities .",
    "as alluded to earlier , significant ( @xmath66 ) pockets of patchy dust do improve the fit to the disc colours , but dust is absent from the central regions in this galaxy .",
    "in fact the dust seems to be distributed along the inner parts of weak spiral arms , as is often seen in local galaxies . for the comparison shown in figures",
    "24 we have assumed solar metallicity , but as shown in figure 5 varying metallicity can not result in synchronization of the ages in the inner and outer parts of this system .",
    "the distribution of star formation timescales ( @xmath27 ) shown in figures 24 requires careful explanation . as the tracks in the colour - colour plane show , we have greatest sensitivity to @xmath27 for populations of intermediate age .",
    "for the bulge light there is almost complete degeneracy in solving for @xmath27 . accordingly the slight mismatch between the model prediction for @xmath64 and the observations can swing the fit to a high @xmath27 whereas the convergence of the tracks at these ages would be compatible with any value .",
    "however even for the shortest star - formation timescales the age of the bulge is considerably older than that of the disc , ruling out the possibility that star - formation timescales , rather than age , is responsible for the redder bulge light .",
    "in fact no variation in star - formation history , metallicity , or dust alters the basic conclusion that the redder bulge colours are simply due to these pixels originating from the oldest starlight in the galaxy .",
    "however figure 5 does show that varying metallicity within reasonable limits ( the excellent agreement between the observed dispersion of colours along the solar metallicity tracks effectively restricts the metallicity of the disc light in this case to 75% @xmath17 @xmath67 @xmath17120% solar ) shifts the absolute ages of the various components in this system  confirmation that our technique is best used to study only relative differences in age . in ",
    "4 we define a simple statistic which quantifies the relative ages of the inner and outer portions of all spirals in our sample .      our second example ( figure 3 ) is a high redshift elliptical with @xmath58=20.9 mag .",
    "the object is remarkably homogeneous in its @xmath64 and @xmath57 colours and consistent with a coeval formation of all visible starlight .",
    "the red spectral energy distribution means that the @xmath6 image is extremely faint which leads to a large random error in the @xmath6@xmath61 colours ( except for the brighter central regions coloured red in the colour - colour diagrams shown in fig .",
    "3 ) . because the colours of this galaxy correspond ( in effect ) to a single point on the colour - colour diagram , no particular age - track is mapped out , and thus the system is particularly subject to the well - known age - metallicity degeneracy that plagues analysis of integrated colours of early type systems .",
    "this point is shown clearly in figure 5 ( b ) which shows the @xmath57 vs. @xmath63 colour plane for models with 30% solar , solar and 150% solar metallicities .",
    "the key point here is that , although the absolute age inferred is indeed critically dependent on the adopted metallicity , two important conclusions remain unchanged : ( i ) the light of the galaxy is consistent with a _",
    "single _ stellar age , ( ii ) the age is cosmologically significant given the large look - back to this source .",
    "the final example ( figure 4 ) consists of an elliptical with @xmath58=21.8 mag at @xmath56=0.478 . in this case",
    "there is an obvious spread in the internal colours in this system .",
    "we see the same spread in @xmath6-@xmath61 colours as in figure 3 corresponding to the lower signal to noise in the @xmath6 band for faint sources .",
    "however , the nuclear region of the galaxy is significantly bluer than the outer galaxian light , consistent with a younger stellar age ( this object might be considered an example of a `` blue nucleated galaxy '' ( schade et al .",
    "1995 ) , except that it is not morphologically peculiar ) .",
    "this remarkable conclusion holds even when the maximum likelihood analysis attempts to minimize the age spread in this system by invoking a conveniently arranged annulus of dust .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation of the colour data is that this e / s0 is _ not _ a simple stellar system and that some fraction of the starlight was produced within 2 gyr of the epoch of observation . in the next section",
    "we will quantify the frequency of occurrence of cases with such star - formation histories .",
    "in order to apply the methodology illustrated above to a representative sample , we now consider the @xmath021.9 mag galaxies in the bouwens et al ( 1997 ) sample , as this constitutes the faintest statistically - complete sample in the hdf with redshift information .",
    "because the model tracks are considerably more degenerate at low redshifts when using the hdf filter set , we will not consider the three galaxies with @xmath68 in the bouwens et al list .",
    "thus our sample consists of 28 galaxies with @xmath69 .",
    "firstly , we consider the distribution of galaxy properties within the broad morphological categories ( e / s0 : sabc : irr / pec / merger ) adopted initially by the medium deep survey team ( glazebrook et al 1995 ) .",
    "a puzzling feature of the bouwens et al catalogue is that only a small number ( 3/31 ) are apparently ` irr / pec / merger ' whereas , within the entire mds survey to the same magnitude limit , this fraction is close to 30% . in order to check this result and to facilitate comparison with the survey of brinchmann et al ( 1997 ) , the bouwen",
    "et al hst images have been reclassified by one of us ( rse ) and absolute magnitudes in @xmath70 , recomputed using k - corrections corresponding to the mean luminosity - weighted age and star - formation history from our model fits .",
    "the revised properties of the bouwens et al sample are listed in table 1 .",
    "we find good agreement between our absolute magnitudes and those of bouwens et al .",
    "however the morphological classifications of a number of systems are rather different .",
    "three objects categorised as spirals by bouwens et al ( hdf-3.400,hdf-3.143 , and hdf-4.950 , corresponding to # s 16 , 27 , 30 in bouwens table 1 ) have been classed by us as ` irr / pec / merger ' and a fourth ( hdf-4.402 , # 22 in bouwens et al s table 1 ) is a marginal case .",
    "although a somewhat subjective correction , the visual classification doubles the number in this category reducing but not eliminating the discrepancy with the mds counts .",
    "however , examination of the irr number counts within the hdf itself to @xmath7122 ( abraham et al 1996 ) does indicate a marginal deficiency with respect to the more extensive mds counts which we presume arises simply from small number statistics .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the detailed analysis of the colour distribution of individual galaxies and those of a given morphology has given a good indication of the advantages and restrictions of our method . however , if we wish to ultimately derive conclusions concerning the star formation history of volume - averaged populations , we need to extend the techniques taking into account the detectability of each galaxy as a function of @xmath56 and the relative masses involved in the various star formation phases .",
    "this is an important point notwithstanding the conclusions in @xmath144.1 - 4.2 since , as various authors have discussed ( white 1996 , brinchmann et al 1997 ) morphology may be a transient property . in principle",
    "our method offers an opportunity to examine more general trends  as discussed in the next section .",
    "a major conceptual advantage of our method is that by focussing on star - formation history on a pixel - by - pixel basis , we probe galaxian star - formation history in a manner that is meaningful even in the face of morphological transformations . even in an evolutionary scenario dominated by density evolution ,",
    "stars from the merger fragments are still present in the merger product .",
    "so the structure of the star - formation history curves shown in figure 7 is a partial record of the formation history of the stars in the final system , even if we have no information about the morphologies of the fragments .",
    "we can thus consider whether the bouwens et al galaxy sample is predominantly the result of star - formation activity which peaked at @xmath91 - 2 , as claimed by madau et al 1998 .",
    "there are several complications in conducting such calculations .",
    "firstly , taking this approach requires us to assume _ absolute _ ages for the galaxy sample , rather than the more robust relative ages for internal galaxian components , upon which we have focussed so far .",
    "an equally important complication is that the bouwens et al sample is flux - limited and so spans a range in look - back time and luminosities . to convert discrete realisations of the sf history @xmath72 for @xmath73=1,n objects spanning a range of redshifts @xmath74 , into its comoving average , @xmath75",
    ", we must adopt a cosmological model @xmath76 , and weight each @xmath73th contribution by @xmath77 ( schmidt 1968 ; bouwens et al .",
    "1998 ) :    @xmath78$$\\ ] ]    as an illustration of this , we have attempted to combine the histories @xmath72 for most of the galaxies in table 1 in order to produce an estimate of the global history @xmath79 ( figure 8) where we compare our results with that of madau et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "we show curves as an envelope whose limits correspond to 30% solar and 150% solar metallicity for the entire sample .",
    "we cut off the diagram at @xmath80 ( with the last observational data point corresponding to @xmath81 because of the small sample size considered  at @xmath82 one or two individual bright galaxies dominate the total star - formation history plot , and poisson errors become dominant .",
    "the curves correspond to the volume - averaged star - formation histories for all spirals , peculiars , irregulars , and the four `` young '' ellipticals in the sample .",
    "`` coeval '' ellipticals have been excluded from consideration because the contribution at high redshift from these systems depends crucially on their adopted absolute ages ( which are very poorly constrained because , by definition , they have little dispersion in internal colour ) . in any case",
    "these systems are likely to contribute mostly at @xmath83 .",
    "although clearly an approximation ( whose correctness is subject to the necessity for assuming absolute , rather than relative , ages in the calculation ) , the extrapolated star - formation history of the universe calculated by adding together results from just @xmath84 galaxies in the bouwens sample approximates that obtained completely independently from deep galaxy surveys . at redshifts @xmath85 the survey data points lie slightly below the predicted curve from our analysis , but this may not be significant given the rather large uncertainties on both the models and the data points , and given the omission of `` old ellipticals '' ( which must be contributing a small amount of star formation even at @xmath86 ) from the models .    at face value figure  8 suggests that roughly all the starlight located in deep surveys at @xmath86 ultimately ends up in galaxies represented by the systems in the bouwens sample . while interesting , this conclusion is highly uncertain , not least because of the very small sample size used in this extrapolation . in particular , we have already noted there is an apparent deficiency of irregular / peculiar / merger galaxies in the bouwens et al sample compared to wider field hst studies .",
    "if the @xmath71 inventory is richer in star forming systems whose evolution is important ( as suggested by the results of brinchmann et al ) then either the contribution of late type systems beyond @xmath91 can not be dominant or the extrapolation is unreliable .",
    "an obvious example would be the presence of dust , not in the currently - observed bouwens et al sample or additional sources thought to be under - represented at @xmath71 , but perhaps in their predecessors seen at earlier times . at this stage , this is largely speculation .",
    "the major result is the predictive power of our colour - based techniques particularly when enhanced with larger and deeper samples .",
    "it is interesting to contrast our method with the approach of brinchmann et al ( 1998 ) who derived luminosity functions and volume - averaged luminosity densities for morphological subsets from the combination of hst imaging and ground - based redshift surveys for @xmath87300 field galaxies . whilst they discussed the validity of the assumption that the morphological type is a time invariant property ,",
    "their analysis was primarily concerned with calculating the contribution of each class to the redshift - dependent star formation rate .",
    "they found the greatest rate change with redshift over 0@xmath21 belonged to galaxies of irregular morphologies although the largest contribution to the volume - averaged total at @xmath91 was from disc galaxies .",
    "brinchmann et al argued that it is unlikely that the rapidly declining population of galaxies with irregular morphologies transform to form large disc galaxies given the contrast in evolutionary trends .",
    "even with @xmath88300 galaxies with redshifts and hst morphologies , once the sample is broken into redshift and morphology bins , the statistics necessary to reach convincing conclusions becomes marginal .",
    "furthermore , the likelihood of a possible migration from one class to another as the star formation rate changes or , more simply , a fading below the detection limit as the rate declines could easily complicate the above conclusions .",
    "our technique offers a number of ways with which to overcome the limitations of the brinchmann et al analysis .",
    "foremost , we can address in more detail the question of the homogeneity in the star - formation history of a given class .",
    "the issue here is not simply the scatter from one galaxy to another within a given class , but the dispersion in internal pixel colours and the implications of this for the star - formation histories .",
    "admittedly there is no short cut to having a fair and representative sample of galaxies to analyse , but the availability of resolved data opens up a much more powerful tool for addressing issues related , for example , to the question of whether most field ellipticals are simple coeval stellar populations .",
    "the second advantage of our method is that we can , within the limitations discussed earlier , by focussing on star - formation sidestep the difficulty of not knowing the precursor population of each class . indeed , in principle , we can abandon morphological categories altogether and simply isolate those @xmath71 galaxies which are likely to have dominated the star formation history 2 - 5 gyr earlier .",
    "finally , of course , we can address the history of distinct sub - components such as bulges and discs .",
    "it is important to consider ways to verify the validity of many of our conclusions . concerning the issue of whether spheroidal galaxies are being continuously produced",
    ", our approach in examining evidence in the colours for recent mergers can be easily extended to higher redshifts .",
    "the technique complements other approaches based on colour distributions . for the disc galaxy evolution",
    ", it will be possible to verify our star formation rates directly , and constrain dust content , once integral field spectroscopy becomes feasible to the necessary surface brightness limits .",
    "the greatest restriction in the application of our method is the need for redshifts which , presently , restricts the hdf sample to only 32 galaxies . by extending the hdf surveys to deeper spectroscopic limits or perhaps adopting photometric redshifts , this restriction can be partially overcome .",
    "a greater redshift range would allow intermediate redshift samples to be directly compared with their statistical ancestors for consistency purposes .",
    "a second enhancement is the extension of our method to near - infrared passbands . without infrared observations to help constrain the appropriate dust law ,",
    "it is difficult to constrain definitively the possible interplay between dust and genuine stellar histories .",
    "even with ground - based photometry , the integrated near - infrared magnitudes offer a way to verify the global properties inferred for a given galaxy , but ultimately we can expect to use nicmos data to extend the full resolved colour - colour analysis .",
    "later papers in the series will take these ideas forward and address more closely the role of the star forming irregulars thought to be dominant in the intermediate redshift range .",
    "we summarise our conclusions as follows :    \\1 .",
    "the spectral synthesis modelling of the spatially resolved internal colours of galaxies of known redshift is an important new technique for probing galaxy evolution , offering a number of benefits compared to studies based on integrated colour alone .",
    "the technique makes an explicit connection between evolutionary history and stellar populations .",
    "we use the dispersion around colour - colour tracks to distinguish between models that are degenerate in terms of integrated colour enabling the dust content to be explicitly parameterized and allowing the star - formation histories of physically - distinct galactic subcomponents to be reconstructed .",
    "most importantly , internal colour analyses enable robust studies of _ relative ages _ addressing the homogeneity of stellar populations and probing the order in which galactic components have been assembled .",
    "most early - type systems ( 7/11 ) in the bouwens et al .",
    "redshift sample have internal colour dispersions consistent with being old and coeval , but ( adopting @xmath89 as the criterion for an old , coeval system ) _ over one - third [ 4/11 ] of the early type systems studied do not_. this result contrasts with that derived from the scatter in colour - magnitude diagrams for populations of spheroidals in distant rich clusters .",
    "the field sample is much too small for detailed conclusions to be drawn regarding the star - formation history of early type systems as a class , but the current fraction ( @xmath90 ) of young early - type systems is reasonably consistent with the predictions from hierarchical models . if one adopts a less stringent definition for old , coeval system ( say @xmath91 ) then the constraints on hierarchical models become substantially tighter .",
    "we therefore suggest that specific predictions for the distribution of @xmath92 would provide a valuable test of the success of hierarchical models .",
    "however , quantifying the fraction of young early - type galaxies expected in such scenarios depends on how quickly such systems relax after a merger event , and hence how such systems are classified both visually and on the basis of n - body / semi - analytic models .",
    "similar criteria must be adopted for both observations and models .",
    "we find that the bulges in the hdf spirals are generally redder than their disks with a median age unambiguously older in the majority ( 6/9 ) and at least as old as the disk in most of the remainder ( 2/9 ) .",
    "bulges exhibit qualitatively different star - formation histories from their surrounding disks indicating a short initial period of star - formation followed by relative quiescence . unless bulges are heavily enriched relative to disks , these results strongly support the `` traditional '' picture for the formation of bulges and pose a serious challenge to competing secular evolution models .",
    "the overall dust content in galaxies from the bouwens et al sample at intermediate redshifts @xmath93 is fairly similar to that seen locally . spirals and irregulars exhibit evidence for patchy pockets of dust at the @xmath94 level , but the majority ( 10/11 ) of early - type galaxies appear essentially dust - free . no galaxy in this sample appears to have internal colour dispersions suggestive of major obscuration nor internal colours dominated by dust as opposed to age or star - formation history . as in the local universe ,",
    "dust in the intermediate - redshift universe ( @xmath95 ) appears to play a subsidiary role in the interpretation of galaxy morphology and number counts .",
    "our conclusions are dependent , however , on the universal validity of the calzetti ( 1997 ) extinction law and independent tests of the applicability of this law over a range of redshifts and galaxy types are of the first importance .",
    "the star - formation histories we infer for field spirals agree with those derived from deep galaxy surveys .",
    "if significant morphological transformations have not occurred within our spiral sample , then our declining star - formation histories are consistent with typical fading in disk light by @xmath96 mag between @xmath97 and @xmath98 , in agreement with the values obtained from the cfrs and ldss surveys ( brinchmann et al .",
    "1998 ; lilly et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the peak in the volume - averaged star - formation activity contributed by starlight in @xmath99 disc galaxies occurred close to @xmath97 .",
    "\\6 . as our methodology focusses on the stellar content ( rather than on the bulk morphological properties )",
    ", we illustrate how an approximate inventory of the total starlight in our galaxy sample can be backtracked towards the formation epoch without assuming that morphologies are preserved .",
    "surprisingly , we recover the bulk of the starlight seen in deeper surveys .",
    "the present sample is very small and this is a tentative result , particularly as there is some evidence that the bouwens et al sample is deficient in star forming galaxies . however ,",
    "if confirmed , it would suggest that star - formation at @xmath86 is not occurring dominantly in systems which have escaped detection in deep optical surveys .",
