    "an interplay of the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , magnetism and superconducting correlations in some solids and their interfaces leads to a number of electron transport phenomena , that attracted recent interest in connection with potential spintronic applications . in the core of unusual transport properties of such systems",
    "lie the direct and inverse spin - galvanic effects ( sge ) .",
    "the former is to produce the electric current by polarized spins .",
    "the inverse to sge effect is also called the edelstein effect .",
    "these phenomena have been predicted a long time ago for normal systems .",
    "@xcite the electric current induced by polarized spins was first observed in a semiconductor quantum well ( qw ) in ref .",
    "[ ] , where the spin polarization was created by an optical excitation .",
    "closely related to sge are direct and inverse spin - hall effects ( she ) which convert the charge current into the perpendicular spin current and back . for a review of she in normal systems",
    "a fundamental difference between superconducting and normal systems is that in superconductors the spin - charge conversion can occur in thermodynamically equilibrium conditions .",
    "for example , a spontaneous supercurrent may be produced by an equilibrium spin polarization induced by a static zeeman field , that is impossible in a normal metal .",
    "@xcite this effect , however , can not be observed in spatially uniform systems , because in a weak uniform zeeman field the so called inhomogeneous helix phase is formed @xcite where the electric current is absent . on the other hand ,",
    "the supercurrent may be induced in the presence of an inhomogeneous zeeman field .",
    "@xcite the equilibrium sge , as well as the equilibrium analog of the inverse spin - hall effect , were predicted in the so called phi-0 josephson junctions .",
    "@xcite the supercurrent may also be produced by light illumination of a hybrid superconductor - semiconductor system .",
    "@xcite the inverse sge was considered for two - dimensional ( 2d ) superconductors , where the supercurrent creates the equilibrium magnetization by polarizing electron spins .",
    "another group of effects involves a nonequilibrium spin polarization , as well as a spin current pumped into a superconducting system by some external source .",
    "as was shown for soc caused by spin - orbit impurities , such a nonequilibrium spin distribution can generate the electric current and electric potential in superconductors .",
    "@xcite this nonequilibrium situation resembles much the analogous effects in normal systems . in superconductors ,",
    "however , the electric and spin transport parameters are determined by quasiparticle characteristics , that are strongly renormalized by the gap in the electron energy spectrum .",
    "@xcite besides , there are typical for superconductors charge imbalance effects , that did not discussed yet in this context .    in this paper",
    "the spin - charge conversion effect will be considered for a bilayer system consisting of a normal metal layer with a strong rashba soc and a s - wave superconducting layer .",
    "both layers are coupled through a tunneling barrier .",
    "the nonequilibrium spin polarization is injected into the normal layer , as shown in fig .",
    "an advantage of such a system is that it combines strong spin - orbit coupled electrons of the normal metal and correlated cooper pairs of the superconductor .",
    "there are good candidates for the former , such as narrow gap semiconductor quantum wells ( qw ) and some insulator interfaces .",
    "@xcite for example , high quality epitaxy grown hybrid semiconductor - superconductor systems has been reported recently .",
    "@xcite    due to rashba soc , in such a bilayer system the injected spin polarization gives rise to the electric current inside the normal layer .",
    "the mechanisms for such a transformation are sge and inverse she .",
    "note , that in the bounded rashba systems , such as strips of a finite width , it is impossible to distinguish between these two effects . this electric current is dissipative and is carried by the quasiparticles , whose energies are below the energy gap of the superconducting layer and above the proximity induced minigap in the spectrum of the normal metal .",
    "then , this current converts into condensate s supercurrent through the andreev reflection , so that at large enough distances from the point of injection the current is carried by the condensate .",
    "the electric potential , that is associated with the quasiparticle s current , also vanishes at large distances together with this current .",
    "such a mechanism of charge imbalance relaxation is the most relevant in the considered low - temperature regime .",
    "the problem will be considered within the semiclassical approximation . for a dirty system",
    "the corresponding usadel equations will be employed for the electron green functions .",
    "it is important that , within the main semiclassical approximation , the standard usadel equations miss the charge - spin coupling , which determines the spin - charge conversion effects .",
    "therefore , such a term will be derived separately , as a linear in @xmath0 nonclassical correction to the usadel equations , where @xmath1 is the spin - orbit splitting of the electron energy at the fermi level @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the chemical potential . in this way",
    "the expression for the generated electric current , as well as coupled differential equations for the order - parameter phase and quasiparticle distribution function will be obtained .",
    "in some important limiting cases these equations will be analyzed analytically .",
    "the paper is organized by the following way . in sec.ii the usadel equation for the bilayer system",
    "will be derived , which phenomenologically accounts for the coupling of the injected spin - dependent distribution to the spin - independent green function . in sec.iii",
    "such a nonclassical spin - charge coupling term will be calculated in the usadel equation and in the electric current expression .",
    "also , charge - imbalance relaxation will be analyzed and the differential equation for the phase of the order - parameter obtained .",
    "we shall consider the electric current generated in a closed loop and evaluate the effective electromotive force , that is produced by the spin injection .",
    "one of the most convenient tools for an analysis of the electron transport in the range of characteristic energies @xmath4 and lengths @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the fermi wave - vector , is a formalism of semiclassical equations for the energy - integrated green functions.@xcite this method operates with the three functions @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote space - time variables . @xmath7 and @xmath8 are , respectively , retarded and advanced green functions , while @xmath9 is the so called keldysh function . the former carry information about the energy spectrum and wave functions of an electron system , while @xmath9 depends on its statistical properties .",

    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 are the chemical potentials of electron gases in two layers ( the band offset is included ) . in the case",
    "when the normal layer is a two - dimensional electron gas , the vector @xmath34 in @xmath35 has only @xmath36 and @xmath37-components , that are parallel to the interface .",
    "soc is represented by the third term in @xmath27 , where @xmath38 is the vector of pauli matrices .",
    "the spin - orbit field @xmath39 is assumed to be a linear function of @xmath34 .",
    "this situation takes place if @xmath40 is represented by the rashba field @xcite @xmath41 , or by the linear dresselhaus @xcite field @xmath42 , as well as by their combination .",
    "below , for simplicity we assume the rashba soc . the electric potentials @xmath43 and @xmath44 appear in eq.([h ] ) due to charge imbalance , that is caused by a conversion of the injected spin polarization into the electric current of quasiparticles . it should be noted that the spin injection explicitly enters only in the quasiparticle s distribution function , while in eq.([h ] ) it is represented implicitly through the electric potential and @xmath45 . in the unperturbed state",
    "we assume @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in principle",
    ", the injected spin polarization might enter into eqs.([h ] ) as an effective zeeman field , that is produced by polarized electrons via the electron - electron exchange interaction , as was discussed in ref .",

    ", as a function of @xmath49 it oscillates fast , within the fermi wavelength .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to fourier transform @xmath13 with respect to @xmath50 and retain intact its dependence on @xmath51 .",
    "also , in the considered stationary regime @xmath13 depends only on the time difference @xmath52 and , hence , can be fourier transformed to the frequency variable @xmath53 .",
    "accordingly , let us introduce the green function as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a dimension of the electron gas in a film ( the labels n and s are omitted for a while ) .",
    "the self - energy may be represented in a similar way .",

    "it will be included together with other nonclassical terms into a correction to the usadel equations in sec.iii .",
    "the right - hand side of eq.([eilenberger ] ) should contain the inelastic scattering term . for a considered here situation",
    "this scattering is not important .",
    "therefore , it was skipped .",
    "let us consider the self - energy term in more detail .",
    "first of all , it contains a contribution from electron collisions with impurities . in the born approximation for a short - range isotropic scattering amplitude",

    "the same relation will be assumed for @xmath97 entering into the self - energy eq.([sigmans2 ] ) of the 2d electron gas , with @xmath131 substituted for 2d density .",

    "further we will focus on some properties of eqs.([usadel2 ] ) and ( [ usadels ] ) , that allow to simplify dramatically the considered problem .",
    "first of all , we note that in the case of a spin - injector represented by a massive nonmagnetic film , to which the spin polarization is pumped from ferromagnetic leads , its retarded and advanced green functions are simply @xmath133 .",
    "this means that they are scalars in the spin space .",
    "hence , the retarded and advanced projections of eq.([usadel2 ] ) are scalars , except for terms with the gauge field @xmath110 .",
    "such terms , however , appear only in the form of commutators of @xmath110 with spin scalars @xmath134 .",

    "@xmath136 one can see from eqs.([usadel2 ] ) and ( [ usadels ] ) that @xmath137 .",
    "further , let us consider the keldysh projection of eqs.([usadel2]),([usadels ] ) .",
    "in contrast to retarded and advanced functions , the function @xmath138 is spin - dependent , because it is determined by the spin dependent distribution function of the injector .",
    "therefore , @xmath139 , as well as @xmath140 are finite . at the same time",
    ", one can see from eqs.([usadel2 ] ) and ( [ usadels ] ) that at @xmath141 the equations for @xmath139 and @xmath140 are decoupled from each other . the equations for the three functions @xmath142 and @xmath143 describe the energy dependent spin diffusion , dyakonov - perel spin relaxation and spin precession associated with the rashba interaction .",
    "these processes are essentially the same and described by the same parameters , as in normal metals in the absence of superconducting proximity effects . in other words , the proximity to the superconductor results in the same renormalization factor for all these effects .",
    "we will return to the spin transport in subsection d. the independence of the charge transport on the spin injection is the main reason why one can not consider the spin - charge conversion effects within the main semiclassical approximation .      for spin independent retarded and advanced functions",
    "@xmath144 one may substitute @xmath145 in eq.([usadel2 ] ) , so that the spin - charge coupling is only implicitly represented through the phase @xmath146 of the order - parameter @xmath147 .",
    "let us first consider the usadel equations for the retarded functions by neglecting a contact with the spin injector .",
    "we also neglect for a moment the terms containing @xmath148 , that are small , because they are proportional to the weak spin - charge coupling .",
    "in such a case @xmath149 do not depend on coordinates . as a result , for the retarded functions eqs.([usadel2 ] ) and ( [ usadels ] ) reduce to @xmath150=0\\nonumber\\\\ & & [ \\omega\\tau_3+it_{ns}g^r_s , g^r_n]=0\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath151 $ ] .",

    "one can see that in the quasiparticle spectrum of the normal layer the minigap @xmath158 opens , that is a common property of sn bilayer systems .",
    "@xcite    since @xmath159 has a varying in space phase , in some cases it is necessary to take into account corresponding corrections to eqs.([gr ] ) .",
    "for green functions of the superconductor these corrections can be easy obtained in the range of high energies @xmath160 by ignoring a contact with the normal layer , whose effect is weak in this frequency range .",
    "it is convenient to perform the unitary transformation @xmath161 .",
    "further , by keeping only linear in @xmath162 terms in eq.([usadels ] ) we arrive to the fourier transformed function @xmath163 in the form @xmath164 where @xmath165 and @xmath76 is the wave - vector . as it will be seen below , this correction is important for calculation of the spin injection effect on the order parameter .",
    "let us now consider a contact with the injector , as a small correction @xmath166 to the functions given by eqs.([gr ] ) .",
    "let us assume that in fig.1 the length @xmath167 of the injector - normal metal contact in the @xmath36-direction is small in comparison with the diffusion length @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "then , one can represent @xmath170 in eq.([usadel2 ] ) in the form @xmath171 .",
    "for the massive injector film it is also assumed the unperturbed value @xmath172 . by linearizing eq.([usadel2 ] ) with respect to @xmath173 we arrive at @xmath174\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath175 .",
    "therefore , this correction is small at @xmath176 , that will be assumed in the following .      in this section",
    "we will consider eqs.([usadel2 ] ) and ( [ usadels ] ) for keldysh functions .",
    "these equations can be transformed to kinetic equations for the distribution function @xmath177 , which is defined by the equation @xcite @xmath178 the expressed in this way function @xmath179 satisfies the proper normalization condition @xmath180 , that is a nondiagonal projection of the general condition @xmath181 .",
    "the distribution function , in turn , can be represented as @xmath182 . as was noted above ,",
    "the spin and charge variables are decoupled in eqs.([usadel2 ] ) and ( [ usadels ] ) .",
    "this means that we have separate equations for the scalar ( @xmath183 ) and triplet ( @xmath184 ) parts of the distribution function .",

    "it follows from eqs.([fspin]-[tildat ] ) that the injector spin distribution function plays the role of a source in eqs.([spinfn ] ) . at low temperatures",
    "the spectral power of this source is distributed in the energy range @xmath203 . at these energies",
    "the tunnel coupling between the normal and superconductor layers is weak because @xmath204 in @xmath205 is finite only due to subgap quasiparticle states .",
    "the contribution of these states is given by the small third term of @xmath157 in eq.([gr ] ) .",
    "in bounded systems eqs.([spinfn ] ) must be appended by boundary conditions .",

    "rashba soc one might try a direct generalization of the boundary condition eq.([bc ] ) by substituting @xmath208 . by setting at the edges @xmath209 and multiplying eq.([bc ] ) by @xmath210 we get @xmath211 .",
    "since the @xmath37-independent retarded and advanced functions are scalars in the spin space , the latter equation may be reduced , with the help of eq.([f ] ) , to a set of equations for vector components of the spin distribution function .",
    "these equations have the form @xmath212 where all functions are taken at @xmath206 .",
    "the same equations take place for the spin density in normal systems , if the diffusive spin current parallel to the @xmath37-axis turns to zero at the hard wall boundary .",
    "@xcite therefore , eqs.([bc ] ) for the distribution function seem reasonable , although this issue deserves a separate study .",
    "due to spin precession in the rashba field the boundary conditions eq.([bc ] ) always mix various spin components .",
    "for example , if the injected spin polarization in eq.([fspin ] ) is initially oriented parallel to @xmath37-axis and homogeneous in the @xmath37-direction , it will rotate towards the @xmath117-axis during propagation along the strip .",
    "therefore , it is impossible to observe a pure spin - galvanic effect in bounded systems , because in the presence of @xmath117-polarized spins the inverse spin - hall effect also takes place .",

    "furthermore , the coupling to the injector may also be neglected , because the function @xmath238 changes its sign in the range of the injector , that makes very inefficient a leakage of @xmath238 into the injector at @xmath256 .",

    "this mechanism is different from the well known charge imbalance relaxation at superconductor - normal metal interfaces , that involves inelastic electron - phonon scattering.@xcite a relaxation of the electric potential is accompanied by a transformation of the electric current of quasiparticles into the supercurrent .",
    "this issue will be discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "as was shown in the previous section , the usadel equations , that were obtained within the main semiclassical approximation , are decoupled into two independent sets of equations for spin- singlet and spin - triplet green functions . in this section",
    "the quantum correction which leads to a mixing of these two sets will be calculated in the first order with respect to @xmath267 .",
    "it follows from sec.ii that , as long as the fermi liquid effects are ignored , the retarded and advanced functions stay scalar in the spin space .",

    "that means that all slowly varying entries in the integral are evaluated at @xmath277 .",
    "since we are interested in quantum corrections , such terms have to be expanded near @xmath6 .",
    "the task , however , is not so vast , because the goal is to calculate only the terms that couple the spin - independent and spin - dependent functions @xmath278 and @xmath279 .",
    "therefore , only the spin - dependent part of @xmath280 will be taken into account in eq.([dyson2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , contributions to @xmath280 , that are caused by electron s tunnelings to the injector and superconductor , are much smaller than the self - energy associated with the elastic impurity scattering .",

    "the phase of the order - parameter can be found from the continuity equation @xmath313 . when the operator @xmath314 is applied to eq.([jtot ] ) one should take into account eq.([f2ns ] ) , eq.([tildat2 ] ) and the relations between the tunneling parameters @xmath97 and @xmath127 , that have been discussed below eq.([usadels ] ) .",

    "plays the role of an effective magnetic flux through the loop , similar to the equilibrium magnetoelectric effect induced by the zeeman field.@xcite in the latter case , the electric current has mostly a dissipative nature and it is more reasonable to describe the effect in terms of an effective electromotive force , that is associated with a nonequilibrium spin polarization , as in the case of the spin - galvanic effect in normal metals .",

    "in particular , in both cases they result in an effective magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "there is , however , a fundamental difference .",
    "the zeeman field gives rise to triplet cooper pairs , whose dynamics in the rashba field and conversion to singlet pairs lead to the magnetoelectric effect .",

    "it modifies the quasiparticle distribution function only .    the spin injection effect becomes stronger at large soc . within the considered theory a strength of this coupling",
    "is restricted only by a smallness of the semiclassical parameter @xmath346 .",
    "also , the effect increases with the larger contact size @xmath167 of the injector .",
    "therefore , the most interesting case corresponds to @xmath347 in eq.([fyn ] ) . at fig.2 the electromotive voltage @xmath348 , that is defined as @xmath349 , is shown as a function of the injection strength @xmath350 , at various @xmath351 . in the normal layer at small temperature",
    "this voltage is a linear function of @xmath350 , namely @xmath352 . at fig.2",

    "we obtain @xmath356 .",
    "the above evaluation of @xmath348 is mostly restricted by limitations of the theory , which does not allow to take larger @xmath99 , @xmath350 and @xmath357 .",

    "whose width is less than the spin relaxation length , one must take into account the boundary conditions eq.([bc ] ) .",
    "the importance of such an analysis becomes evident from eq.([deltaj ] ) for the nonclassical electric current .",
    "indeed , in the case of rashba soc this current can be written in the the form @xmath358\\,.\\ ] ] since , according to eq.([f ] ) @xmath359 , one can apply the boundary conditions eq.([bc ] ) to the integrand of eq.([jnc2 ] ) . as a result , @xmath360 vanishes at the strip boundaries @xmath206 , because just the expression @xmath361 enters in the integrand of eq.([jnc2 ] ) .",
    "hence , in the case of a narrow strip , whose width @xmath362 , one could expect that @xmath360 is small inside the strip . on the other hand ,",
    "the dyakonov - perel spin relaxation time increases dramatically in narrow wires.@xcite therefore , the spin accumulation in the strip increases and may compensate a cancellation of the two terms in eq.([jnc2 ] ) . in order to check that such a compensation indeed takes place ,",
    "let us assume that the injector width @xmath167 is small ( @xmath363 ) . also , in the case of a weak metal - injector coupling one may neglect the back flow of spins from the normal layer .",
    "this means that only @xmath189 must be retained in the tunnel coupling term @xmath364 in eqs.([spinfn ] ) . a weak coupling to the superconductor",
    "will also be neglected .",

    "after integration of eqs.([spinfn ] ) over @xmath36 , the remaining equations may be solved by expanding @xmath365 and @xmath366 in power series in @xmath37 , while @xmath367 . by this way we obtain",
    "@xmath368 let us compare this result with the similar integral obtained in the case of a wide strip .",
    "for such a strip @xmath369 may be neglected , while @xmath215 is given by eq.([fyn ] ) . by expanding this expression with respect to small @xmath370",
    "we obtain the same result as eq.([intxy ] ) . therefore , there is no difference between wide and narrow wires . on the other hand , in narrow wires",
    "the slower spin relaxation causes an enhanced leak of the spin polarization into the injector and superconductor .",
    "consequently , such an effect may become important at larger @xmath167 and @xmath99 .",
    "it has been shown that the spin - galvanic effect in a hybrid superconductor - rashba metal bilayer system also has a hybrid character .",
    "the injected spin polarization induces both a dissipative quasiparticle current in the normal layer and a supercurrent in the superconducting layer .",
    "it depends on the size of the system , which of two effects dominates .",
    "there is some characteristic length where a conversion of the quasiparticle s current into the supercurrent through the andreev reflection occurs . in either of two cases the current of quasiparticles",
    "is strongly influenced by the proximity induced minigap in the electron spectrum .",
    "it should be noted that in bounded systems one can not observe a pure spin - galvanic effect which is produced by in - plane polarized spins . in such systems",
    "rashba soc always rotates these spins towards the z - axis .",
    "the outplane polarization , in turn , gives rise to the spin - hall effect .",
    "therefore , there is always a combination of the two effects .",
    "a special case of a narrow strip has been considered whose width is much smaller than the spin precession length in the rashba field .",
    "in such a situation the spin galvanic and the spin - hall effects tend to cancel each other .",
    "due to the enhanced spin relaxation time in such a narrow wire , the overall effect , however , turned out to be the same as in a wide strip .",
    "since the spin - galvanic effect on the superconducting condensate can be interpreted as an effective magnetic flux , it adds a new functionality to superconducting quantum circuits and set a bridge between magnetic and superconducting circuits .",

    "<S> the spin - galvanic ( inverse edelstein ) and inverse spin - hall effects are calculated for a hybrid system that combines thin superconductor and rashba - metal layers . </S>",
    "<S> these effects are produced by a nonequilibrium spin polarization which is injected into the normal metal layer . </S>",
    "<S> this polarization gives rise to an electric potential that relaxes within some characteristic length , which is determined by the andreev reflection . within this length the dissipative electric current of quasiparticles in the normal layer converts into the supercurrent . </S>",
    "<S> this process involves only subgap states and at the low temperature inelastic electron - phonon interactions are not important . </S>",
    "<S> it is discussed how such a hybrid system can be integrated into a sqid where it produces the effect similar to a magnetic flux . </S>"
