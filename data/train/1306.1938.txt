    ", beneficial mutations can occur in any order , which implies many possible mutational pathways",

    "mutations whose effect depends on the state of other loci ( the _ genetic background _ ) are known as epistatic @xcite .",

    "each genetic locus interacts with a neighborhood of @xmath1 other loci , and different genetic architectures can be realized through different ways of chosing the neighbors . despite its simplicity and lack of biological detail",
    "the nk - model has proven to be useful for parametrizing empirical fitness landscapes , thus providing a quantitative characterization of the strength and type of epistatic interactions in these data sets @xcite .",
    "the versatility of the model can be further increased by considering linear superpositions of nk - landscapes with different values of @xmath1 @xcite .    here",
    "we will focus on fitness landscapes that have a modular structure , in that the genetic loci are divided into disjoint sets , called blocks , which contribute independently to the overall fitness .",
    "such a model was first introduced by perelson and macken @xcite , and it can be viewed as a special case of kauffman s nk - model .",
    "we will see that the block structure significantly facilitates analytic calculations , to the extent that a detailed characterization of the full probability distribution of the number of accessible mutational pathways becomes possible .",
    "surprisingly , the exact expression for the mean number of accessible paths , similar to the mean number of optima derived in @xcite , turns out to closely match the numerical estimates obtained for other versions of the nk - model @xcite . at the same time",
    "the fluctuations in these quantities show a strong dependence on the genetic architecture , leading in particular to a very low evolutionary accessibility of the block model landscape compared to the nk - model with random ( non - modular ) interactions studied previously @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we explain the basic mathematical concepts required for the description of genotype spaces and fitness landscapes , and introduce the models of interest .",
    "our results on the evolutionary accessibility of modular landscapes are presented in sect .",
    "[ results ] , and the paper concludes with a summary and an outlook in sect .  [ summary ] .",
    "in the sswm regime the genetic variability in a population is small and it can be assumed that all individuals have the same genotype most of the time , apart from the transient appearance of single new mutations .",
    "the genotype of a population can be modeled as a binary sequence of length @xmath0 , @xmath2 where each @xmath3 is either @xmath4 or @xmath5 representing two different alleles at locus @xmath6 or a wild type and a mutated type .",
    "the space of all possible genotypes is then the binary hypercube @xmath7 , which we extend into a normed space by introducing the hamming norm @xmath8 and the induced hamming metric @xmath9 .",
    "this metric represents the number of loci in which two genotypes differ and hence the minimal number of point mutations needed to reach one from the other . for future reference",
    "we define the _ antipodal _ or reversal sequence @xmath10 of a genotype @xmath11 through @xmath12 .",
    "a genotype and its antipodal sequence are maximally distant from each other , @xmath13 for all @xmath11 .",
    "since we only consider point mutations , we define the mutation operator @xmath14 which mutates locus @xmath6 as @xmath15 we can extend this notion to simultaneous mutations at several loci .",
    "let @xmath16 be the set of loci that are to be mutated .",
    "we then denote the group mutation operator as @xmath17 .",
    "a fitness landscape on the space of sequences of length @xmath0 is a mapping from @xmath18 into the real numbers @xmath19 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath20 to refer to the change in fitness by mutating all loci in @xmath21 starting from genotype @xmath11 . by applying each single locus mutation to each genotype on the fitness landscape",
    "we generate an @xmath0-dimensional real vector field @xmath22 on the genotype space , @xmath23 .",
    "this field determines the effect of every possible mutation at each point of the fitness landscape .",
    "it defines the fitness landscape uniquely up to a constant .",
    "therefore all relevant properties of the fitness landscape are determined by @xmath22 .",
    "however not all mappings @xmath24 are valid mutation fields of a fitness landscape .    in the following we",
    "introduce the fitness landscape models of interest in this work .",
    "they are random field models in the sense of @xcite and bear a close resemblance to spin glass models of statistical physics @xcite .",
    "a common way of quantifying the ruggedness of such fitness or energy landscapes is through the number of local maxima , and we compile some known results for this quantity for the different models below .      in the house - of - cards ( hoc ) model every fitness value is drawn identically and independently from a real - valued probability distribution @xcite . since only the sign of fitness change is relevant to accessibility , it is sufficient to consider the hoc model as a random rank order on the genotype space .",
    "the properties discussed here therefore do not depend on the chosen probability distribution .",
    "up to a change of sign the hoc landscape is equivalent to the energy landscape in derrida s random energy model ( rem ) of spin glasses @xcite . for completeness",
    "we note that also the rem in an external magnetic field has an evolutionary analogue in the rough mt .",
    "fuji ( rmf ) model @xcite .    the mean number of local maxima of the hoc landscape can be obtained from a simple argument .",
    "a given genotype is a local maximum if its fitness value exceeds that of its @xmath0 neighbors , which is true with probability @xmath25 by symmetry .",
    "since there is a total of @xmath26 genotypes , the expected value of the number @xmath27 of optima is @xcite @xmath28 the corresponding variance is @xcite @xmath29 which implies that the coefficient of variation @xmath30 tends to zero for large @xmath0 , i.e. the distribution of @xmath27 becomes increasingly localized near its mean .",

    "we have shown in this paper that imposing a modular block structure on the set of genetic loci substantially changes the behavior of fitness landscapes . while mean values for the number of optima as well as for the number of accessible paths are similar between block landscapes and other types of nk landscapes , there is a qualitative difference between the overall structure of the distributions of these topographic features . in both cases",
    "the distributions show higher variability for large @xmath0 in the block model than in the an and rn models and also display strong discreteness effects .",
    "the most pronounced difference is observed in the overall evolutionary accessibility , defined here as the probability for the existence of at least one accessible path to the global fitness maximum , which decreases very fast with @xmath0 on block landscapes .",

    "the number of accessible paths will still be the product of the accessible paths on the modules and basic results such as the exponential decrease in accessibility for constant block sizes will still hold . this way it would also be possible to apply our results to modular fitness landscapes that incorporate other biologically important properties , such as neutral mutations .",

    "our results suggest that the choice of neighborhoods in the nk model and , more generally , the architecture of genetic interactions is an important aspect to consider when relating fitness landscape models to real world data @xcite . assuming that the genetic architecture itself is , in some sense , under evolutionary selection , the low accessibility of modular landscapes would seem to favor connected genetic interaction networks , as unconnected block structures make it impossible to reach the global optimum in the sswm regime . on the other hand",
    ", we have also seen that the rare realizations that contain at least one path tend to have many paths . if each module could evolve independently towards high accessibility , block landscapes",
    "would therefore prove advantageous by allowing many routes to the optimal genotype .",
    "interestingly , in the presence of recombination the modular structure appears to facilitate rather than impede evolutionary adaptation @xcite , and to elucidate the interplay of recombination and genetic architecture is a promising direction for future research .",
    "we can make use of the findings of the present paper to revisit the observation , first reported in @xcite , that rn model landscapes are rather inaccessible for small values of @xmath1 , in particular for @xmath84 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : compaccess ] ) .",
    "this is surprising because ruggedness is generally expected to increase with @xmath1 , such that @xmath84 landscapes should be quite smooth .",
    "however , at low @xmath1 the random graph of interactions between loci is sparse ( compare to fig .  [",
    "fig : nk ] ) , and the likelihood for the graph being disconnected , thus effectively giving rise to a modular landscape of low accessibility , is increased .",

    "[ fig : compaccess ] ) , shows that graph connectivity can not be the main factor determining the accessibility of these landscapes .",

    "<S> we show that the number of accessible paths can be written as a product of the path numbers within the blocks , which provides a detailed analytic description of the path statistics . </S>",
    "<S> the block model can be viewed as a special case of kauffman s nk - model , and we compare the analytic results to simulations of the nk - model with different genetic architectures . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the mean number of accessible paths in the different versions of the model are quite similar , but the distribution of the path number is qualitatively different in the block model due to its multiplicative structure . </S>",
    "<S> a similar statement applies to the number of local fitness maxima in the nk - models , which has been studied extensively in previous works . </S>",
    "<S> the overall evolutionary accessibility of the landscape , as quantified by the probability to find at least one accessible path to the global maximum , is dramatically lowered by the modular structure . </S>"
