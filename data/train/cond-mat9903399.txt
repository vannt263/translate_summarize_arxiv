    "the bcs to bose - einstein ( be ) crossover has been widely studied in the last several years,@xcite being originally motivated by the occurrence of a short coherence length in high - temperature superconductors .",
    "the evolution from large overlapping cooper pairs ( bcs limit ) to small nonoverlapping bosons ( be limit ) has essentially been envisaged by relying on the associated two - body problem in the three - dimensional case , wherein bound fermion pairs ( composite bosons ) form as soon as the strength of the attractive interparticle potential exceeds a threshold .",
    "the emphasis on the role of the interparticle potential has , however , somewhat overshadowed the effects of the particle density on the crossover itself , even though on physical grounds one would expect both the interparticle potential _ and _ the density to play an essential role .",
    "the role played by the density is suggested especially when one analyzes the experimental phase diagram of the high - temperature cuprate superconductors in terms of the bcs - be crossover , since in this case it would be the ( effective ) carrier density ( that is related to the doping level ) to drive the system from the vicinity of the be ( underdoped ) to the bcs ( overdoped ) limit.@xcite    purpose of this paper is to study the _ combined _ effects of the particle density and the interparticle potential on the ( zero - temperature ) bcs - be crossover , in order to characterize how physical quantities evolve by varying , in particular , the particle density . to this end , we will set up a `` phase diagram '' in the space of the potential strength and of the density , where the locations of the alternative bcs - like , crossover - like , and be - like regions will be identified for several types of potentials .",
    "previous work on the bcs - be crossover has utilized : _ (",
    "i ) _ a three - dimensional contact potential for the continuum model @xcite ; _ ( ii ) _ the separable potential introduced by nozires and schmitt - rink ( nsr ) @xcite for the three - dimensional continuum model , with a characteristic momentum cutoff @xmath2 @xcite ; and _ ( iii ) _ a negative-@xmath3 hubbard model on a two - dimensional square lattice , with either an on - site @xcite or a nearest - neighbor @xcite attraction . in this paper",
    ", we shall consider both the continuum model in three spatial dimensions using three different types of interparticle potentials , and the @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave solutions for the attractive ( extended ) hubbard model on a two - dimensional square lattice .",
    "this will enable us to study the effects of the particle density on the bcs - be crossover in a rather systematic way .",
    "for the continuum case , it turns out that the _ finite range _ of the potential allows for the occurrence of the density - induced bcs - be crossover , which is instead not possible in the case of a contact ( zero - range ) potential . as a consequence , the size of the bcs - like region in the `` phase diagram '' gets progressively enlarged by increasing the range of the interparticle potential .    for the lattice case , the shape of the `` phase diagram '' and the physical interpretation of the alternative regions therein depend markedly on the symmetry ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) of the pairing .",
    "in particular , for the @xmath1-wave pairing an increasingly larger range of correlations among the composite bosons sets up when approaching half filling , thus establishing a tendency toward the formation of a quasi - long - range - ordered antiferromagnetic state .",
    "in addition , the @xmath1-wave pairing , being associated with an interaction of a finite range on the lattice , enables the density - induced bcs - be crossover to occur over a wider range of the parameters with respect to the @xmath0-wave pairing , in analogy to what found for the continuum case .",
    "all results presented in this paper have been obtained within a zero - temperature broken - symmetry mean - field approach , which thus appears capable of producing results that are sensible on physical grounds under widely different physical conditions .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we discuss the three - dimensional continuum case in section ii and the two - dimensional lattice case in section iii .",
    "section iv gives our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we examine the three - dimensional bcs - be crossover in the continuum case for three types of interaction potentials , and determine how the range of the potential influences the coupling vs density `` phase diagram '' .",
    "specifically , we consider the contact and the separable nsr potentials mentioned in the introduction , plus a non - separable gaussian potential .",
    "for the three - dimensional continuum case , a _ contact potential _ has often been adopted as _ the reference model _ that captures the essence of the expected physics of the bcs - be crossover , as a function of the coupling strength for given particle density . for a contact potential , the analytic solution at the ( zero temperature ) mean - field level and with the inclusion of gaussian fluctuations has been determined,@xcite for _ all _ values of the coupling strength ( regularized in terms of the scattering length @xmath4 of the associated two - body problem ) and of the density ( represented in terms of the fermi wave vector @xmath5 ) .",
    "all relevant physical quantities can thus be expressed in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath6 , with @xmath5 being positive by definition and @xmath4 changing its sign as soon as a bound state develops .",
    "for this reason , by keeping @xmath5 fixed and varying @xmath4 from @xmath7 to @xmath8 one can pass with continuity from the bcs to the be regime across the crossover region ; on the contrary , by keeping @xmath4 fixed and varying @xmath5 one is _ not _ able to pass from the bcs to the be regime , since the parameter @xmath6 can not change its sign in this way .",
    "= 8truecm    figure  1 shows the ( @xmath9,@xmath10 ) `` phase diagram '' for a contact potential in three dimensions , as obtained from the available analytic solution,@xcite where bcs - like , crossover - like , and be - like regions are identified by drawing the two curves corresponding to @xmath11 and @xmath12 . here",
    ", @xmath13 represents the correlation length for pairs of opposite - spin fermions , while the two values ( @xmath14 ) of the parameter @xmath15 characterize , in the order , the lower limit of the bcs - like region ( with large overlapping cooper pairs ) and the upper limit of the be - like region ( with small nonoverlapping bosons ) , the crossover region being constrained in between.@xcite the ( effective ) coupling constant in this case is represented by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is an arbitrary unit of length . as anticipated above ,",
    "it is evident from this `` phase diagram '' that for a contact potential in three dimensions it is _ not _ possible to cross over from the bcs to the be region by varying the density alone at fixed coupling strength .    in the three - dimensional continuum case ,",
    "therefore , to examine the density - induced bcs - be crossover a potential with _ finite range _ in real space is required , or equivalently , it is necessary to introduce a momentum cutoff @xmath2 in momentum space . in this context ,",
    "one may utilize the separable potential @xmath18 ( between fermions with opposite spins ) adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and later used by some authors.@xcite since this potential may yield unphysical results @xcite ( also because the factorization @xmath21 is somewhat arbitrary ) , we have considered in addition a non - separable potential @xmath22 , which we have taken for definiteness of the gaussian form :    @xmath23    ( @xmath19 ) . by doing so , it will also be possible to determine how alternative ways of introducing an effective range in the interaction potential affect the boundaries of the crossover region in the ( @xmath24 ) `` phase diagram '' ( @xmath25 being the critical value of @xmath26 for which a bound state appears in the two - body problem ) .",
    "in addition , and contrary to the separable nsr potential , the gaussian potential ( [ v ] ) leads to momentum - decoupling effects for small values of @xmath2 , which have recently been proposed as characteristic features of high - temperature superconductors.@xcite    for the nsr and gaussian potentials , an analytic solution for the ( zero - temperature ) bcs - be crossover at the mean - field level is lacking . for these potentials ,",
    "we have thus solved numerically the coupled equations for the gap function @xmath27 and the chemical potential @xmath28 :    @xmath29    and    @xmath30    where @xmath31 ( @xmath32 being the fermionic mass ) , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the particle density .",
    "we recall that , while for a separable potential the gap function acquires the form @xmath35 , for a non - separable potential @xmath27 does not follow in general the wave vector dependence of the potential .",
    "in addition , for the nsr separable potential analytic expressions for @xmath36 and @xmath28 can be obtained in the two ( bcs and be ) limits .",
    "= 8truecm    figure  2 shows the ( @xmath37,@xmath38 ) `` phase diagram '' for the ( a ) nsr and ( b ) gaussian potentials , where the two characteristic curves @xmath39 for each potential have been identified as for fig .  1 .",
    "in addition , we have reported in fig .",
    "2 the curve corresponding to @xmath40 ( broken line ) for both potentials . by comparing fig .  2 with fig .  1 , we note that the boundary between the be - like and the crossover - like regions is not much altered by the introduction of a finite cutoff @xmath2 ; on the contrary , the boundary between the bcs - like and the crossover - like regions is drastically modified , with the bcs - like region extending even to values @xmath41 for sufficiently high densities .",
    "note also the reentrant shape of the curve @xmath11 at @xmath42 for both potentials , which makes it possible to cross over from the bcs to the be region _ by varying the density _ for fixed @xmath43 .",
    "it is further interesting to note that the three curves of fig .",
    "2a and of fig .",
    "2b depart from the common origin ( @xmath44,@xmath45 ) .",
    "near this origin , in fact , @xmath46 and the gap @xmath47 on the bcs side is proportional to @xmath48 , as given by the solution for a contact potential.@xcite since @xmath49 in the bcs limit,@xcite keeping the product @xmath50 , requires @xmath51 when @xmath52 .",

    "the value of @xmath65 can be obtained analytically in the bcs limit ( and @xmath64 ) , in the form    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the density of states at the fermi level ( per spin component ) and @xmath68 . in this case , the decrease of @xmath69 for increasing @xmath38 overcomes in eq .",
    "( [ delta / mu ] ) the increase of @xmath70 , and drives the system toward the bcs ( weak - coupling ) limit . for the non - separable gaussian potential , on the other hand , it is the effective reduction of the density of states and not the decrease of the potential strength to drive the system toward the bcs limit for increasing @xmath38 at given @xmath71 . to verify this statement",
    ", we recall that in the bcs limit @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) is strongly peaked about @xmath5 .",
    "when @xmath64 , @xmath27 is thus also strongly peaked about @xmath5 owing to the form ( [ v ] ) of the potential . in this way , for given value of @xmath73 , the integral over @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) extends effectively over a sphere centered about @xmath73 with radius of the order @xmath2 .",
    "the relevant density of states gets thus reduced from the value @xmath70 by a geometrical factor @xmath75 of the order @xmath76 , which represents the ratio of the effective volume of integration and the bcs spherical shell of width @xmath77 .",
    "we then obtain in the bcs limit for the gaussian potential when @xmath64 :    @xmath78    in this case , it is thus the decrease of @xmath75 for increasing @xmath5 to drive the system toward the bcs ( weak - coupling ) limit for a given value of @xmath71 .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that , although the qualitative behavior of the curves corresponding to @xmath79 in figs .",
    "2a and 2b looks similar , the physical mechanism behind them appears to be quite different . for the separable nsr potential the increase of @xmath38 results into a reduction of the interaction strength , while for the non - separable gaussian potential it results into a reduction of the relevant density of states",
    "these two alternative effects allow the density - induced bcs - be crossover to occur in the two cases , respectively .",
    "the curves of fig .  2 have been drawn cautiously , up to values of @xmath37 for which the condition @xmath80 is satisfied .",
    "this condition avoids , in fact , instabilities of the system in the bosonic limit , which unavoidably occur when a fermionic potential with _",
    "finite _ momentum range @xmath2 is considered , and are due to the boson - boson effective interaction potential having a dominant attractive part in this case.@xcite we have verified , in particular , for the gaussian potential that the bosonic chemical potential @xmath81 ( where @xmath82 is the bound - state energy of the associated two - body problem ) @xcite becomes negative when @xmath83 , a behavior which can be attributed to an overall attraction among the composite bosons ( with the compressibility being , however , still positive ) . in this context , we mention also that the existence of a competition between pair and quartet condensation in a fermi liquid with a finite - range attraction has recently been investigated.@xcite    a related instability toward phase separation ( with the compressibility becoming instead negative ) has been generically pointed out for the attractive ( extended ) hubbard model on a two - dimensional square lattice,@xcite which we pass now to examine in detail in the context of the bcs - be crossover .",
    "in this section , we examine the bcs - be crossover for a two - dimensional attractive hubbard model , again addressing specifically the role played by the particle density in driving this crossover . to consider the @xmath1-wave besides the @xmath0-wave solution",
    ", we take the fermionic potential to contain an inter - site besides an on - site term . in addition , for the @xmath1-wave solution we adopt two different single - particle dispersions , in order to mimic the low - energy electronic band structure observed for the cuprates in different doping ranges,@xcite as discussed in more detail below .",

    "for the continuum case , the limit of a `` dilute '' gas of composite bosons can be reached for any particle density , insofar as the range of the residual bosonic interaction ( or , equivalently , the size of the composite bosons ) vanishes for large values of the fermionic interaction strength ( barring the instability problem mentioned at the end of section ii ) . in the lattice case , instead , the lattice spacing provides an additional length scale in the problem , which makes it possible to depart from the `` dilute '' gas limit irrespective of the size of the composite bosons .",

    "such a correlation makes , in fact , the energy required to extract two fermions from the system different from the energy required to break up a _ single _ composite boson in isolation , owing to the additional correlation energy among the composite bosons .",
    "the relevance of the correlation energy among the composite bosons is also suggested by the behavior of the `` bosonic '' chemical potential @xmath156 in the be region ( delimited by @xmath157 , irrespective of the single - particle dispersion ) . in this low - density region one",
    "finds @xmath158 . when @xmath159 , @xmath160 is negative , corresponding to an effective average _ attraction _ between the composite bosons .",
    "the compressibility of the system is also negative at this order , thus indicating a tendency toward phase separation.@xcite when @xmath161 , on the other hand , @xmath160 and the compressibility are both positive ; in this case , the effective bosonic average interaction would be _ repulsive _ , with an increasing repulsion between the composite bosons as @xmath26 ( and @xmath3 ) increases .",
    "this situation has to be contrasted with the negative-@xmath3 hubbard model , for which the composite bosons become asymptotically free as @xmath162.@xcite",
    "in this paper we have examined how the particle density influences the bcs - be crossover , by analyzing several types of fermionic interaction potentials both in three dimensions ( continuum case ) and in two dimensions ( continuum and lattice cases ) .",
    "we have reached the conclusion that the finite range of the potential as well as the absence of a threshold ( for a bound state to occur in the associated two - body problem ) favor quite generally the density - induced crossover .    in particular , for the continuum case we have verified that in three dimensions ( where a finite threshold exists in the two - body problem ) it is the finite range of the potential to make the density - induced crossover possible , while in two dimensions the absence of a threshold suffices to the purpose even when a zero - range potential is considered . in addition , for the continuum case we have argued that the density - induced crossover ( for a finite - range potential ) occurs at arbitrary values of the interaction strength , owing to the fact that , in this case , the particle density can be augmented without bound .    for the lattice case ,",
    "we have considered two dimensions only and investigated , alternatively , the absence or presence of a threshold , depending on the symmetry of the gap parameter and on the shape of the single - particle dispersion relation .",
    "we have found that the absence of a threshold definitely favors the density - induced bcs - be crossover , and that spreading the range of the potential on the lattice makes the density - induced bcs - be crossover to occur over a wider density range . in the presence of a threshold ( at least for the specific potential extending over nearest - neighbor sites that we have considered ) , on the other hand , the density - induced bcs - be crossover turned out not to be possible , owing essentially to the absence of the reentrant shape of the curve delimiting the bcs - like region .",
    "this situation contrasts our finding for the continuum case in the presence of a threshold .    in this respect ,",
    "an important difference between the continuum and lattice cases appears to be the occurrence of an intrinsic _ upper value for the density _ in the lattice case , at least when one considers a simple band only . in this case",
    ", the fermi wave vector @xmath5 can not exceed an upper bound of the order @xmath163 ( in units of the inverse of the lattice constant ) .",
    "for the nearest - neighbor interaction which we have considered in the lattice case , the characteristic wave vector @xmath2 , too , can be taken of the order @xmath163 and the condition @xmath164 ( which in the continuum case was associated with the reentrant shape ) can not be satisfied .",
    "consequently , no reentrant shape of the curve delimiting the bcs - like region is expected for the lattice case .",
    "the occurrence of the reentrant shape , however , may not _ a priori _ be excluded when considering an interaction potential extending over distant neighbors in the lattice , thus decreasing @xmath2 accordingly . in any case , the occurrence of an intrinsic upper bound on the density ( and thus on @xmath5 ) will make the bcs - like region to disappear for large enough interaction strength , thus preventing the density - induced bcs - be crossover .",
    "we have also found that the presence of an upper bound on the density in the lattice case and the finite size of the composite bosons for the @xmath1-wave solution induce definite correlations among the composite bosons , giving rise to a magnetic correlated state near half filling .",
    "the simultaneous presence of superconducting off - diagonal long - range order _ and _ of antiferromagnetic correlations without long - range order , which we have found for the @xmath1-wave solution , represents _ per se _ an appealing result , in the light of the current phenomenology of the cuprate superconductors .",
    "the interesting physics that has emerged for the @xmath1-wave solution in the lattice case may then provide a general framework for future investigations on the bcs - be crossover , for instance , considering finite - temperature effects and going beyond the mean - field approximation . in this respect , facing a proper treatment of the residual boson - boson interaction in the be region seems to be unavoidable , not only in the three - dimensional continuum case ( as shown already in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but especially in the two - dimensional lattice case for the @xmath1-wave solution , where the boson - boson interaction gets considerably enhanced .",
    "finally , we point out that the need of a reduced spatial dimensionality and of a finite range of the potential , which we have found for the density - induced bcs - be crossover to occur , matches the generic features observed for the cuprate superconductors and strengthen accordingly the bcs - be crossover as a possible scenario for describing the evolution from overdoped to underdoped cuprates .",
    "we are indebted to c. castellani for discussions .",
    "one of us ( p.p . ) gratefully acknowledges receipt of a postdoctoral research fellowship from the italian infm under contract pra - htcs/96 - 98 .",
    "it is , in principle , possible for the attractive potential to vary with carrier density .",
    "[ this effect can be found , e.g. , near a quantum critical point driven by the carrier density itself ( c. castellani , c. di castro , and m. grilli , z. phys .",
    "b*103 * , 137 ( 1997 ) ) . ] knowledge , however , of the form of the interparticle potential and of its dependence on carrier density rests on an explicit microscopic theory , which is beyond the scope of the present crossover approach . by this approach , in fact , the interparticle potential is parametrized in a rather simple form , independent from the particle density .                              for the negative-@xmath3 hubbard model , the hartree shift @xmath92 makes the chemical potential to coincide with @xmath166 in the bosonic ( strong - coupling ) limit , _ irrespective _ of the value of @xmath34 ( in such a way that the bosonic chemical potential @xmath156 vanishes in the limit - cf .",
    "the result for @xmath28 given in ref .",
    "[ recall instead that for the continuum case the inclusion of the hartree shift is not required . ] accordingly , the physical picture which emerges in the strong - coupling limit would correspond to a system of non - interacting composite bosons ( with vanishing size ) , although near half filling this elementary picture is not completely satisfactory owing to the overlapping argument discussed in the text . in any event , we shall consider the negative-@xmath3 hubbard model as the _ reference model _ for the bcs - be crossover in the lattice case , akin to the contact potential in the continuum case .",
    "for the alternative model considered in the lattice case ( with an attraction between nearest - neighbor sites ) , the same procedure of adding the hartree shift will consistently be adopted .",
    "for the @xmath122 model the density of states is no longer symmetric about half filling . nevertheless , in fig .",
    "4b we have considered @xmath167 only , because the remaining values of @xmath34 are of no physical interest .    although the @xmath122 model lacks the particle - hole symmetry of the @xmath118 model , when @xmath26 is large enough the kinetic term of the hamiltonian becomes immaterial and the @xmath122 model behaves like the @xmath118 model .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "5a hold , therefore , for both models .",
    "it can be verified that the quasi - long - range - order state with antiferromagnetic correlations discussed in the text ( which was obtained from the bcs state in the limit @xmath132 and @xmath134 ) has higher energy than the nel state ( which is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian in this limit and exhibits true long - range order ) .",
    "let @xmath168 , where @xmath169 runs over all pairs of nearest - neighbor sites and the kinetic energy has been neglected in the limit .",
    "it can then be verified that @xmath170 is given by @xmath171 for the bcs state and by @xmath172 for the nel state .",
    "this difference can be ascribed to the fact that the bcs state orders the composite bosons by condensing them in momentum space , while a more appropriate description should correspond to the composite bosons being ordered in real space ( as depicted in fig .",
    "5b ) . an improved wave function ( over and above the bcs state )",
    "is thus required to describe the composite bosons in the limit @xmath132 and @xmath134 ."
