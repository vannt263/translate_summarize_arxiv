    "some control of the rate of change of the curvature is possible by the choice of @xmath44 relative to @xmath15 . in this case , where they are approximately equal at start of the ramp , the curvature does not greatly deviate from a linear reduction , and this is also true for the case @xmath103 . in the opposite",

    "the mexican hat description is more appropriate for this situation .",
    "a second method for loading bose condensates into a double - top configuration is to evaporatively cool a thermal cloud . in this case",
    "the evaporation process is much the same as for a standard top trap , with the rf field oriented perpendicular to the rotating bias field , except that rf resonance occurs at two points at the perimeter of the cloud rather than one .",
    "alternatively , an atomic cloud could be cooled first in a ip trap and then in a double - top .",
    "however in this case , the standard orientation for the rf antenna in a ip trap is not well matched for optimum evaporation in the double - top .",
    "careful control of the barrier height will be important in any investigation of condensate splitting and josephson tunneling .",
    "such studies are likely to require a barrier height comparable with the condensate chemical potential and therefore much smaller than that which we considered in the sections above .",

    "( b ) control of the barrier height by altering the rotating bias field @xmath44 with @xmath59",
    "g. note that even at 25  g the barrier height is still considerably greater than the chemical potential . ]    initially the barrier is some 100 times higher than the chemical potential but decreases to a comparable height at @xmath113  mg .",
    "the chemical potential is estimated by a numerical method where we integrate over the magnetic potential in the thomas - fermi approximation @xcite .",
    "we keep the number of atoms constant at @xmath101 for each value of @xmath15 and solve for the chemical potential .",
    "note that achieving very low barriers with this method requires very small values of @xmath15 , which is discussed below .",
    "we could also lower the barrier height by increasing @xmath44 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : barrier_height](b ) . for our choice of parameters , using this method to make the barrier height equivalent to the chemical potential would involve increasing @xmath44 to approximately @xmath114  g , and is therefore impractical .",
    "however , with a lower value of @xmath15 , increasing @xmath44 offers greater sensitivity .",
    "for example , with @xmath115  mg the barrier height and chemical potential become comparable when @xmath44 is approximately 20  g.    achieving small well spacing also requires a very small bias field . for example , to obtain a well spacing of requires a static bias field of only -17  mg for our choice of axial curvature .",
    "note that , so that best control is achieved for largest possible curvatures and widely separated wells .",
    "achieving tight control of close well spacing and low barrier height therefore requires a high degree of coil current stability and shielding from external fields .",
    "high current power supplies of the sort often used for ip traps have relatively poor current stability , so that achieving close well separation with these is likely to be difficult . however , a low current example where a high degree of stability has been achieved is the quic trap @xcite .",
    "the authors report in ref .",
    "@xcite reducing `` residual fluctuations in the magnetic field to a level below 0.1 mg '' .",
    "since the bias field required to achieve control over the well separation is small it should be possible to add a small external bias field without compromising the stability of a quic - style trap .",
    "it is worth noting that in the limit of a very small well spacing it becomes increasingly difficult to form a significant barrier , because this requires @xmath116 .",
    "this condition leads to a very small @xmath117 and subsequent trap loss from majorana spin - flips .",
    "ensher has also found evidence @xcite that an atomic cloud in a top trap with small @xmath44 is vulnerable to transitions to untrapped magnetic spin states , induced by residual ac magnetic fields associated with current noise .",
    "we have developed a theoretical description for a double - well magnetic trap suitable for confining bose - einstein condensates and cold thermal clouds .",
    "the separation of the wells is controlled by the static bias field @xmath15 , while the barrier height also depends on the rotating bias field @xmath44 .",
    "we have developed analytical forms of the potential that describe one or both wells , which are in good agreement with numerical simulations of the time - averaged field .",
    "this trap has the convenient feature that it is based solely on magnetic fields and therefore avoids the issue of the relative stability of magnetic and optical fields addressed in @xcite .",
    "it also offers a barrier height and well spacing that are tunable , so that a wide range of condensate phenomena may be accessible .",
    "wide well separations are readily achieved and may be useful for interferometric applications , where a condensate in one well is perturbed and a second ( local oscillator ) is not .",
