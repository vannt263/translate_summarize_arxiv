    "a physical theory of the sfr should explain why the star - formation process is slow , meaning that it converts only a small fraction of the gas mass into stars in a free - fall time , @xmath6 , both on galactic scale @xcite and on the scale of individual clouds @xcite .",
    "several authors have proposed that the observed supersonic turbulence may be responsible for keeping the sfr low by providing turbulent pressure support against the gravitational collapse .",
    "for example , @xcite presented a gravitational instability analysis that includes the effect of local turbulent pressure support ; @xcite defined the critical density for star formation based on the local turbulent pressure support of a bonnor - ebert sphere ; @xcite proposed that the salpeter stellar imf is the result of the local turbulent pressure support .",
    "in all these works , the turbulent pressure is assumed to scale according to the observed larson velocity - size relation @xcite or by numerical simulations .",
    "the concept of turbulent pressure support was introduced in the context of subsonic , small - scale turbulence by @xcite .",
    "it applies when the two following conditions are satisfied , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the length scale , @xmath10 is the jeans length , @xmath11 is the velocity dispersion , and @xmath12 is the sound speed . in the supersonic turbulence of star - forming regions , both conditions are violated . as a result , the turbulence can actually trigger gravitational collapse , causing a large - scale compression rather than preventing it .",
    "the turbulence is responsible for much of the complex and filamentary density structure observed in molecular clouds , and prestellar cores are likely assembled as the densest regions in this turbulent fragmentation process @xcite .",
    "however , even though supersonic turbulence is able to intermittently create dense regions that are gravitationally unstable , it does so only inefficiently , and its net effect on the large scale is that of suppressing star formation when the total turbulent kinetic energy exceeds the total gravitational energy .",
    "focusing on the competition between supersonic turbulence and self - gravity , the star - formation process can be shown to depend primarily on the ratio of the turbulent kinetic energy , @xmath13 and the gravitational energy , @xmath14 , of a star - forming region .",
    "this ratio may be measured by the virial parameter introduced by @xcite , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the one - dimensional rms velocity , @xmath17 and @xmath18 the cloud radius and mass respectively , and @xmath19 the gravitational constant , and it has been assumed the cloud is a sphere with uniform density . if the dynamical time is defined as the ratio of the cloud radius and the three - dimensional rms velocity , @xmath20 , and using the standard definition of the free - fall time , @xmath21 , the virial parameter can also be expressed as @xmath22 @xcite derived a theoretical model where the sfr is primarily controlled by the virial parameter . in this model , it is assumed that the gas mass above some critical density , @xmath23 , is gravitationally unstable , and the fraction of this unstable mass is computed assuming the gas density obeys a log - normal pdf @xcite . following @xcite ,",
    "the critical density is defined through the comparison of the jeans length and the sonic - scale , @xmath24 , which is the scale where the turbulent velocity differences are of the order of the speed of sound .",
    "the critical density is equivalent to that of the critical bonnor - ebert mass of size @xmath24 .",
    "the idea of relying on the density pdf was also exploited in @xcite to explain the stellar imf and the origin of brown dwarfs , and by @xcite to model the sfr .",
    "the model of @xcite was calibrated and tested using low - resolution sph simulations by @xcite . because of the important role of turbulent energy in this model , low - resolution simulations are inadequate .",
    "they do not develop an inertial range of turbulence and are expected to produce a too large sfr  which they do , as recognized in a later paper , based on higher - resolution grid simulations , by some of the same authors @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite estimated a rather low sfr from the simulations of @xcite by fitting only their early evolution .",
    "we argue this is a transient phase of accelerated sfr and should not be used to test the model ( although it can not be excluded that real molecular clouds experience such a phase of accelerated star formation , the initial transient phase in the simulations is of numerical origin , due to the sudden inclusion of self - gravity in our case , or to the memory of artificial initial conditions in @xcite , where gravity is included from the beginning ) . a new set of larger simulations is needed to properly test the theoretical model .",
    "because the model by @xcite does not include the effect of magnetic fields , a new model based on magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence should be derived , and this new mhd model should be tested with large numerical simulations as well .    in this work",
    "we propose such a new mhd model of the sfr , and we test it with an unprecedented set of large numerical simulations of driven , supersonic , self - gravitating , mhd turbulence , where collapsing cores are represented by accreting sink particles . both the model and the simulations are limited to the case of an isothermal gas , and the effect of deviations from the isothermal behavior are not addressed . to model the process of star formation",
    "we must include gravitational , turbulent , magnetic , and thermal energies .",
    "here we express their relative importance through the virial parameter , @xmath0 , the rms sonic mach number , @xmath1 , and the mean gas pressure to mean magnetic pressure , @xmath2 , and we derive a model that depends explicitly on all three non - dimensional parameters . in the non - magnetized limit of @xmath5",
    ", our definition of the critical density for star formation has the same dependence on @xmath0 and @xmath1 as in the model of @xcite , but our derivation does not rely on the concepts of local turbulent pressure support and sonic scale as in that work .",
    "however , even in this non - magnetized case , our model predicts a different dependence of the sfr on @xmath0 and @xmath1 than the model of @xcite , because we assume that regions exceeding the critical density turn into stars on a timescale given by their local free - fall time , rather than the free - fall time of the mean density .",
    "although the non - magnetized case can be derived from our mhd model in the limit of @xmath5 , we structure the paper by first deriving the critical density in the purely hydrodynamic ( hd ) case (  2 ) , and then in the general mhd case (  3 ) .",
    "likewise , in  4 we first present a simple model for the density pdf in the hd case , and then generalize the approach to mhd turbulence . in  5 we derive the model predictions for the sfr and in  6 we present our numerical simulations of hd and mhd self - gravitating turbulence .",
    "the comparison between the model and the simulations is presented in  7 , results are discussed in  8 , and conclusions are summarized in  9 .",
    "in the hydrodynamic ( hd ) case , the main source of pressure in the postshock gas is the thermal pressure , so the shock jump conditions are given by the balance of thermal pressure and ram pressure : @xmath25 where @xmath12 is the sound speed , @xmath26 and @xmath27 the preshock and postshock gas densities , and @xmath28 the shock velocity . because we use this equation to estimate a characteristic postshock density in the hd case , @xmath27 , we choose the mean gas density , @xmath26 , as the preshock density , and half the rms velocity , @xmath29 , as the shock velocity . assuming an ensemble of eddies with a randomly oriented velocity of mean magnitude @xmath29 , the average collision velocity is also @xmath29 .",
    "however , the shock velocity is half of that average collision velocity because the postshock layer is confined by two shocks , each with velocity @xmath28 .",
    "the characteristic density is then given by : @xmath30 where @xmath1 is the rms sonic mach number , and the characteristic thickness , @xmath31 , of the postshock layers is : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the size ( e.g. the diameter for a sphere ) of the system and @xmath34 , with @xmath35 , is the turbulence integral scale . because the turbulence velocity scaling is approximately @xmath36 , this characteristic thickness is practically scale - independent ( it would have been the same if derived at any other scale , not only at the integral scale ) . the local condition for collapse is that @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the bonnor - ebert mass @xcite with external density equal to the postshock density @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the mass of a uniform sphere of radius @xmath42 , @xmath43 .    because the thickness , @xmath44 , is scale",
    "independent , the condition for collapse can be used to define a scale - independent critical density for collapse .",
    "the local density depends on the distribution of local shock velocity and preshock density and is known to follow a log - normal pdf @xcite , so there is a finite probability that a region exceeds the critical density and undergoes collapse .",
    "we therefore define the critical density for star formation , @xmath45 , as the minimum density that satisfies the local condition for collapse : @xmath46 which yields : @xmath47 where @xmath0 is the virial parameter defined above in equation ( [ alpha ] ) , and can be re - written as @xmath48 assuming the system is a uniform sphere of radius @xmath49 , mean gas density @xmath26 , and three - dimensional rms turbulent velocity @xmath29 .",
    "the critical density defined by equation ( [ eq_rhocr_hd ] ) has the same dependence on @xmath0 and almost the same dependence on @xmath1 as the critical density derived by @xcite .",
    "however , the critical density has been derived here without any reference to the concepts of turbulent pressure support and sonic scale . on the contrary",
    ", our derivation is based on the idea that the turbulence is a trigger of local gravitational instabilities through its dynamical pressure .",
    "this physical difference between the two derivations is reflected by the mach number dependence . in @xcite , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the exponent of the velocity - size relation , @xmath52 , which gives the same dependence on mach number as in our model , @xmath53 , only for the specific value of @xmath54 . in supersonic turbulence , however , the scaling exponent is not necessarily identical to the burgers value of @xmath54 .",
    "numerical simulations yield somewhat smaller values based on the second order velocity structure functions , or somewhat larger ones based on the first order @xcite .",
    "the ratio between the characteristic density , @xmath27 , and the critical density , @xmath45 , is independent of @xmath1 , @xmath55 which anticipates the result that the mass fraction with density above @xmath45 ( and hence the sfr ) , must have a rather weak mach number dependence ( despite the strong dependence of @xmath45 on @xmath1 ) , and must increase with decreasing @xmath0 ( weaker turbulence relative to gravity ) .    in numerical simulations ,",
    "the integral scale of the turbulence is somewhat smaller than the system size ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "for example , in our simulations of supersonic turbulence driven in the range of wavenumbers @xmath57 ( @xmath58 corresponds to the box size ) , @xmath59 ( including a correction factor discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt this value of @xmath60 when we compare the models with the simulations in  7 .",
    "if star - forming regions are driven on very large scales , for example by the expansion of supernova remnants @xcite , the turbulence integral scale could be much larger than the size of individual star - forming regions .",
    "however , in our model @xmath61 is the characteristic scale of regions of compression with velocity of order the flow rms velocity , @xmath29 , with @xmath29 measured within the region of size @xmath33 .",
    "we therefore adopt the same value of @xmath62 as estimated in the simulations . with @xmath62 ,",
    "the critical number density is @xmath63 adopting characteristic parameters of molecular clouds on a scale of 10  pc , @xmath64 , @xmath65  @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , we get a characteristic number density of @xmath68  @xmath66 from equation ( [ eq2 ] ) , reasonable for prestellar cores , and a factor of 3.5 below the critical number density , @xmath69  @xmath66 . the critical overdensity factor of 350.1 is somewhat larger than the value of 275 derived from equation ( 27 ) of @xcite , using the same values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( notice that their mach number is 1d , so a factor of @xmath70 smaller than ours ) and assuming @xmath71 for their numerical coefficient ( their best fit to numerical simulations ) .",
    "we now consider the magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) case . including both thermal and magnetic pressures , and using @xmath28 for the shock velocity , like in equation ( [ eq1 ] )",
    ", the pressure balance condition for mhd shocks is : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the alfvn velocity in the postshock gas defined by the postshock magnetic field perpendicular to the direction of compression .",
    "because the field is amplified only in the direction perpendicular to the compression , the postshock perpendicular field is comparable to the total postshock field , where the second equality is from the fact that the component parallel to the direction of the compression is not amplified .",
    "if we take an average , assuming a random orientation of the magnetic field relative to the direction of compression , we get @xmath74 , and hence @xmath75 .",
    "thus , on the average , the relative error in @xmath76 as a result of assuming @xmath77 is @xmath78 , which is typically of order 1% or less . ] , and we can write , @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the postshock magnetic field and @xmath39 the postshock gas density .",
    "the characteristic gas density and thickness of postshock layers are thus given by : @xmath81     mhd turbulence simulation prior to the inclusion of self - gravity .",
    "the alfvn velocity is essentially independent of density for densities above the mean .",
    "the dotted line shows the mean value of 0.21 , computed for densities larger than twice the mean . ]",
    "@xmath82    where we have introduced the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure in the postshock gas , @xmath83 . in the limit of @xmath84 , these expressions reduce to the corresponding hd ones , given by equations ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath85 is not scale independent .",
    "its scale dependence is at the heart of the relation between the exponent of the salpeter stellar imf and the turbulent velocity power spectrum , in the imf model of padoan and nordlund ( 2002 ) .",
    "however , we can still define a characteristic thickness , and hence a characteristic critical density , as in the hd case , because the average postshock alfvn velocity , @xmath73 ( and the corresponding postshock @xmath76 ) , is only very weakly dependent on density . in numerical simulations of supersonic and super - alfvnic turbulence",
    ", it is found that , although @xmath73 has a very large scatter for any given density , its mean value is nearly density independent , corresponding to a mean relation approaching @xmath86 for a very weak mean magnetic field @xcite . in the specific mhd simulation used in this work , the mean value of @xmath73 is almost exactly constant for any density @xmath87 ( see figure  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "zeeman splitting measurements of the magnetic field strength in molecular cloud cores are also consistent with an average value of @xmath73 nearly independent of density @xcite .    like in the hd case",
    ", we define the critical density as the density above which a uniform sphere of radius @xmath88 is gravitationally unstable , assuming that variations in the thickness around @xmath85 are not strongly correlated with the density variations . to account for both thermal and magnetic support",
    ", we adopt the approximation of the critical mass for collapse , @xmath89 , introduced by @xcite , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the magnetic critical mass for a sphere of radius @xmath17 , mean density equal to the postshock density @xmath39 , and constant mass - to - flux ratio , @xmath92 where the numerical coefficient 0.17 is from @xcite ( see also @xcite for the case of an infinite sheet , and @xcite for a discussion of ellipsoidal clouds and other geometries ) .",
    "the critical density is defined by the condition , @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "equation ( [ eq_condition ] ) results in the following expression for the critical density as a function of the three non - dimensional parameters , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath76 : @xmath95 which is smaller than @xmath45 for any value of @xmath76 , and reduces to the expression for @xmath45 given by equation ( [ eq_rhocr_hd ] ) , in the limit of @xmath84 .",
    "the relative ratio of characteristic to critical density in mhd and hd is given by the following function of @xmath76 : @xmath96 this ratio is slightly larger than unity for any value of @xmath76 ( with a maximum of @xmath97 at @xmath98 ) , suggesting that star formation should be slightly more likely in mhd turbulence than in the hd case .",
    "however , due to the less broad gas density pdf in the mhd case ( see the next section ) , the net result is instead a lower sfr in mhd than in hd .",
    "we have verified that the average value of @xmath76 is nearly independent of density in the mhd simulation used to generate the initial condition for the mhd star - formation simulations described in  6 . in that simulation ,",
    "the rms sonic mach number is @xmath99 and the mean alfvn velocity @xmath100 , computed with the mean density and mean magnetic field .",
    "however , the rms magnetic field is amplified by the turbulence , so the actual alfvn velocity should be computed as the _ local _ absolute value of @xmath80 divided by the _ local _ value of the density , which gives , @xmath101 , if averaged over all regions with density larger than twice the mean ( the alfvn velocity introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq_pressure ] ) is measured in the postshock gas , so it should be estimated as an average in over - dense regions ) .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] shows the mean alfvn velocity as a function of the gas density in the snapshot used as the initial condition for the mhd star - formation simulations ( see   6 ) .",
    "the alfvn velocity is almost exactly constant at densities above the mean .    in numerical simulations of super - alfvnic turbulence ,",
    "the rms magnetic field is the result of the amplification of some weak initial field by compressions and , possibly , by a turbulent dynamo .",
    "these simulations typically start from an initially uniform field , @xmath102 , which is also the conserved mean magnetic field .",
    "it would be useful to relate our postshock @xmath76 to the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure computed with the mean magnetic field , @xmath102 , and the mean gas density , @xmath26 , @xmath103 , where @xmath104 .",
    "an approximate relation for the dependence of @xmath76 on @xmath2 and @xmath1 can be derived based on flux freezing , on the simplified mhd shock jump conditions without thermal pressure ( where we assume the characteristic shock velocity is @xmath28 , as in equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq_pressure ] ) ) , and neglecting dynamical alignement of flow velocity and magnetic field : @xmath105 with the mhd simulation of this work , we derive @xmath106 when @xmath76 is computed from the mean squared value of @xmath73 averaged over the whole computational box ( not limited to over - dense regions ) .",
    "we find that equation ( [ eq_betamodel ] ) is a very good approximation also for the three @xmath107 simulations of @xcite , where @xmath108 , and @xmath109 , 2 , and 20 ( it overestimates @xmath76 by approximately 20% for @xmath109 and 2.0 , and underestimates it by approximately 2% for @xmath110 ) .",
    "however , if @xmath76 is computed from the mean squared @xmath73 averaged above a certain density , we find that , as we increase the value of that density threshold , the value of @xmath76 becomes gradually independent of @xmath2 . for densities larger than 50 times the mean , for example , all three simulations yields @xmath111 .",
    "this can be understood as due to the tendency of the strongest density enhancements to originate from compressions along the magnetic field direction .",
    "this tendency becomes stronger for decreasing values of @xmath112 , or , at constant @xmath1 , for decreasing values of @xmath2 , as documented by the increased alignement of flow velocity and magnetic field @xcite .",
    "given the difficulty of deriving a robust value of the effective postshock @xmath76 to be used in the model for the critical density , we estimate @xmath76 based on the density pdf , as explained in the next section .",
    "we will derive a value of @xmath113 .",
    "the compilations of oh and cn zeeman measurements by @xcite and @xcite give an average value of @xmath114 and 0.28 respectively , using the line - of - sight magnetic field strength of their 3-@xmath115 detections , assuming a temperature @xmath116 and 50  k respectively , and averaging the values of @xmath76 of the individual cores .",
    "these estimated values of @xmath76 are very close to that derived in the next section based on the density pdf .",
    "we can estimate the gas mass fraction that is turned into stars by computing the mass fraction above the critical density , as in @xcite . for given values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath76 ( or @xmath2 ) ,",
    "the critical density is fixed , and the mass fraction above the critical density is determined by the density pdf . in the hd case ,",
    "the density pdf is known to be log - normal , with a standard deviation depending on the rms mach number . following the numerical results of @xcite for the mach number dependence , the pdf is given by : @xmath117 dx   \\label{eq15 }   \\vspace{0.1cm}\\ ] ] and the standard deviation , @xmath115 ,",

    "@xcite have shown that the density pdf in supersonic mhd simulations with a strong field , corresponding to a mean value of @xmath123 , is very similar to the density pdf in the hd case . assuming a log - normal pdf , the averaged results given in their table  1 correspond to the relation @xmath124 , with @xmath125 at @xmath126 , and @xmath127 decreasing with increasing mach number for @xmath128 . in their largest mach number",

    "this may not be a good approximation for the low density tail of the pdf , but for the present purpose we are primarily interested in the high density tail . to derive an expression for @xmath133 ,",
    "we first show that the dependence of @xmath134 on @xmath1 can be obtained with a simple derivation , and we then apply the same derivation to the mhd case .",

    "this is again interpreted as due to the growing tendency of large density enhancements to result from compressions parallel to the magnetic field , as the mean magnetic field strength increases , or the value of @xmath2 decreases . based on our model for the standard deviation of the pdf , equation ( [ eq21 ] )",

    "however , this equation has been derived under the same assumptions , and using the same meaning of the postshock @xmath76 , as in the derivation of the critical density .",
    "this justifies our approach of deriving @xmath76 by fitting the density pdf .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] compares the hd and mhd model pdfs to the actual pdfs of the snapshots used as initial conditions for the star - formation simulations .",
    "the mhd model provides an excellent fit to the high density tail of the pdf , for over 5 orders of magnitude in probability . at the highest densities ,",
    "the hd model predicts a slightly larger probability than in the hd simulation , a discrepancy that may be attributed to the limited numerical resolution , and would likely be reduced if the numerical pdf were the result of a time average of many snapshots ( which would also improve the fit of the low density tail of the pdf ) .",
    "the best fit to the mhd pdf is obtained with @xmath113 .",

    "if @xmath0 were to decrease ( increase ) relative to the equilibrium , the sfr would increase ( decrease ) , according to the results of this work , resulting in an increased ( decreased ) energy injection rate by sn explosions , thus restoring a higher ( lower ) value of @xmath0 .",
    "the dependence of the sfr on @xmath0 found in this work suggests that this self - regulation may work quite effectively .",
    "cosmological simulations of galaxy formation provide the rate of gas cooling and infall , which sets the gas reservoir for the star formation process and thus ultimately controls the sfr .",
    "they also include prescriptions for the star formation feedback , known to be essential to recover observed properties of galaxies @xcite .",
    "future galaxy formation simulations should adopt a physical sfr law with an explicit dependence on @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath76 as derived in this work , in order to correctly reflect specific conditions of protogalaxies at different redshifts .",
    "this requires a treatment of the star formation feedback capable of providing an estimate of @xmath0 on scales of order 10 - 100  pc , not far from the spatial resolution currently achieved by the largest cosmological simulations of galaxy formation .",

    "<S> this work presents a new physical model of the star formation rate ( sfr ) , verified with an unprecedented set of large numerical simulations of driven , supersonic , self - gravitating , magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence , where collapsing cores are captured with accreting sink particles . </S>",
    "<S> the model depends on the relative importance of gravitational , turbulent , magnetic , and thermal energies , expressed through the virial parameter , @xmath0 , the rms sonic mach number , @xmath1 , and the ratio of mean gas pressure to mean magnetic pressure , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the sfr is predicted to decrease with increasing @xmath0 ( stronger turbulence relative to gravity ) , to increase with increasing @xmath1 ( for constant values of @xmath0 ) , and to depend weakly on @xmath2 for values typical of star forming regions ( @xmath3 - 20 and @xmath4 - 20 ) . in the unrealistic limit of @xmath5 , that is in the complete absence of a magnetic field , </S>",
    "<S> the sfr increases approximately by a factor of three , which shows the importance of magnetic fields in the star formation process , even when they are relatively weak ( super - alfvnic turbulence ) . in this non - magnetized limit </S>",
    "<S> , our definition of the critical density for star formation has the same dependence on @xmath0 , and almost the same dependence on @xmath1 , as in the model of krumholz and mckee , although our physical derivation does not rely on the concepts of local turbulent pressure and sonic scale . </S>",
    "<S> however , our model predicts a different dependence of the sfr on @xmath0 and @xmath1 than the model of krumholz and mckee . </S>",
    "<S> the star - formation simulations used to test the model result in an approximately constant sfr , after an initial transient phase . both the value of the sfr and its dependence on the virial parameter found in the simulations are shown to agree very well with the theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> a physical model of the sfr is needed for a realistic implementation of the star formation feedback in simulations of galaxy formation , and to retrieve the correct morphological and chemical evolution of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the new star formation law derived in this paper is suitable for such applications . </S>"
