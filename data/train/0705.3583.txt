    "moving contact lines have been studied for more than thirty years but constitute still an open problem in fluid mechanics .",
    "the difficulty comes from the existence of six decades of length scale separating the macroscopic scale from the molecular scale that become active as soon as a contact line moves , due to viscous diffusion .",
    "this effect may be seen in the classical hydrodynamics description , where the no - slip boundary condition leads to a divergence of viscous stresses at the contact line ( @xcite ) .",
    "of course , this singularity can be avoided by considering molecular physics that goes beyond hydrodynamics , such as the description of diffuse interfaces ( @xcite ) , van der waals interactions ( @xcite ) , or a slip at the solid substrate ( @xcite ) .",
    "the latter mechanism has recently been accessed experimentally ( @xcite ) , showing that slip really occurs and is not an ad hoc quantity to save the hydrodynamic description . over a large range of shear rates ,",
    "the velocity @xmath2 of the last layer of molecules was found proportional to the velocity gradient @xmath3 , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the slip length . according to these experiments and molecular dynamics simulations ( @xcite ) ,",
    "large slip lengths are associated to a hydrophobic behaviour . for moderately large contact angles ,",
    "the slip length is of the order of a few molecule sizes .",
    "even though , the difficulty of the moving contact line problem arises from the very large interface curvatures near the contact line , required to balance the viscous stresses ( @xcite ) .",
    "this strongly curved region has to be matched to the macroscopic flow , which is particularly challenging in the dewetting case ( @xcite ) .    on the experimental side , this problem",
    "is essentially studied by examining the macroscopic interface shape as a function of the properly rescaled contact line speed @xmath6 , ( e.g. see @xcite ) , called the capillary number : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are viscosity and surface tensions respectively",
    ". however , macroscopically observable parameters , such as the dynamic contact angle , are not very sensitive to distinguish the microscopic contact line models .",
    "golestanian & raphael proposed that , by studying _",
    "perturbations _ of contact lines , one could discriminate between different dissipation models at the contact line .",
    "their analysis is based on the elastic - like description for _ static _ contact lines ( @xcite ) : a small perturbation of the contact line position with wavector @xmath1 involves the deformation of the free surface over a distance @xmath10 resulting in an elastic capillary energy proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "the contact line returns to its equilibrium straight configuration with a characteristic time @xmath12 such that , in the limit of small contact angles @xmath13 , @xmath14 the @xmath15 dependence reflects the visco - capillary balance within the wedge of liquid bounded by the solid substrate and the free surface .",
    "@xcite were the first to experimentally study this dispersion relation for a static contact line and they confirmed in particular the @xmath11 dependence in the limit of large @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite examined the relaxation of a very slowly moving contact line , distorted by an isolated chemical defect .",
    "they showed that the relaxing line profiles can be described by functions of the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the coordinate along the contact line and @xmath18 is the characteristic speed @xmath19 .",
    "this logarithmic shape is also a direct consequence of the peculiar contact line elasticity ( @xcite ) .    in the case of _ receding _ contact lines , the quasi - static theory by golestanian & raphael predicts that the relaxation time @xmath12 should increase with contact line speed and diverge at the dynamic entrainment transition , i.e. when a steady meniscus can no longer be sustained .",
    "an intriguing consequence of this is that perturbations due to small - scale inhomogeneities of the substrate are no longer damped at the critical point , leading to a roughening of the contact line ( @xcite ) .",
    "this scenario contrasts the dispersion relation obtained from the full - scale hydrodynamic calculation presented in our preceding paper ( part 1 , @xcite ) , predicting a finite relaxation time for perturbations smaller than the capillary length .",
    "this hydrodynamic calculation explicitly accounts for viscous dissipation at all lengths and is thus expected to be more accurate than a quasi - static approach , in which dissipative effects enter through an effective boundary condition .    in this paper",
    "we experimentally study the global stability and relaxation times of a contact line in the context of a simple dip - coating experiment ( figure  [ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "when a vertical plate is withdrawn from a liquid bath at velocities below the coating transition , the contact line equilibrates and we study the relaxation of well - controlled perturbations .",
    "it is found that the relaxation times indeed increase as the entrainment transition is approached .",
    "however , as we have shown previously ( @xcite ) , the transition is not critical because relaxation times remain finite at threshold .",
    "the full dispersion relation is established and compared quantitatively to hydrodynamic results . above the transition it is found that transients evolve adiabatically through a succession of quasi - steady states .",
    "we can thus , for the first time , experimentally access the full bifurcation structure of the wetting transition , using these transient states .",
    "our experiments confirm the nontrivial bifurcation scenario proposed in part 1 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] we describe briefly the experimental set - up and the physico - chemical properties of the system used .",
    "the framework of the hydrodynamic theory developped in part 1 is briefly recalled in sec .",
    "[ sec : hydro ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : steady ] , we then examine the global shape of the meniscus , essentially characterized by its height above the liquid bath .",
    "we determine the critical velocity for meniscus stability and investigate the bifurcation diagram from transients evolution to liquid deposition .",
    "section  [ sec : dispersion ] is devoted to the analysis of the contact line relaxation .",
    "we first examine periodic pertubations created by rows of defects moving through the contact line .",
    "these perturbations are shown to decay with a rate @xmath0 proportional to the wavevector @xmath1 , as for a static contact line .",
    "we also examine the @xmath20 mode , i.e. the relaxation of the average meniscus height to its stationary position . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we show that the variation of @xmath0 with respect to the capillary number and its behavior near the entrainment transition are well described by the hydrodynamic theory .",
    "we complete this discussion of contact line relaxation , in sec .",
    "[ sec : lorentz ] , by presenting experiments on localized perturbations . in the conclusion",
    "we finally address several open problems in contact line dynamics , particularly , the possible influence of hysteresis which has not yet been studied properly .",
    "from a bath of liquid that does not wet spontaneously on it . _",
    "( b ) _ definition of meniscus rise @xmath21 and the apparent contact angle @xmath22 . ]",
    "the experiment simply consists of withdrawing a non - wetting plate from a vessel filled with viscous liquid ( figure  [ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "the plate is a @xmath23 cm wide strip , cut from a silicon wafer ( siltronix ) .",
    "a thin layer of fluorinated material is deposited on the wafer by dip coating in a solution of fc 725 ( 3 m ) in ethyl acetate .",
    "the liquids used are polydimethylsiloxanes ( pdms , rhodorsil 47v series ) with dynamic viscosities @xmath8 ranging from @xmath24 to @xmath23pa.s ( the corresponding average molecular weights range from 21000 to 40000 ) , surface tension @xmath25  mn / m and density @xmath26 .",
    "the corresponding capillary length is @xmath27  mm .",
    "this particular physico - chemical system was chosen because high molecular weight pdms is non volatile and its low surface tension inhibits rapid contamination of the free surface .",
    "in addition , this allows a direct comparison with other experiments performed with the same system in a different geometry .",
    "pdms is a molten polymer and it exhibits an entanglement transition at a molecular weight around 20000 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the flow behavior is newtonian up to a critical shear rate @xmath28 which decreases with the molecular weight . for the fluids used in this study , @xmath29 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this critical value , above which shear thinning is observed , should be compared to the experimental shear rates at the macroscopic and microscopic scales . at the macroscopic scale @xmath30 , which never exceeds 0.1 @xmath31 .",
    "thus we expect a purely newtonian behavior of the liquid at the scale of the capillary length . at the microscopic scale @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a molecular size of the order of 10 nm",
    ". the shear rate can thus reach @xmath34 very close to the contact line and a moderate decrease of the viscosity might take place ( @xcite ) .",
    "we were not able to measure directly the slip length of our system , but it can be estimated as follows .",
    "starting from the length of the si - si binding ( around @xmath35  nm ) and from the number of monomers ( around @xmath36 for the high viscosity oil of @xmath37 pa.s ) , we obtain the size @xmath38  nm of a molecule ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is known from molecular dynamics simulations that contact angles lower than @xmath39 , for which the interaction between the liquid and the substrate is attractive , give rise to a slip length of the order of 2 molecular lengths ( @xcite ) . throughout the paper",
    "we therefore use the value @xmath40  nm@xmath41 when comparing to theoretical results .",
    "pdms partially wets the fluorinated coating with a static contact angle that can vary from one plate to another by @xmath42 .",
    "the data presented here have been obtained for a receding contact angle of @xmath43 and an advancing contact angle of @xmath44 .",
    "like all the plates prepared for this study , the contact angle hysteresis is thus very low ( @xmath45 ) , as previously obtained ( @xcite ) .    to induce controlled perturbations of the contact line we create wetting defects on the plate using two techniques :    * controlled deposition of ink droplets on the fluorinated coating . when dried , ink has a much higher surface energy than the fluorinated coating , and it is completely wetted by the silicone oils . * spin - coating a layer of photo - sensitive resin ( su-8 microchem ) on the surface of a silicon wafer .",
    "after uv exposure through a mask the resin is developed , leaving cylindrical posts ( 200 @xmath46 m wide , 100 @xmath46 m high ) on the wafer .",
    "the whole surface is then coated with fc-725 , as described above . with this technique , the surface wettability is uniform and the defects are only physical .    both fabrication techniques produce surface defects that are able to significantly distort the contact line as they move through the meniscus .",
    "the size of the vessel containing the liquid is chosen sufficiently large ( 10 @xmath47 10 @xmath48 ) to avoid any capillary interaction between the meniscus on the plate and the menisci formed on the rim of the vessel . also , the cross section of the silicon wafer is @xmath49 times the cross section of the vessel , so that the liquid displacement by the wafer hardly affects the vertical position of the free surface .",
    "when the plate moves at its typical high velocity , 100 @xmath46 m/s , the reference level in the bath is displaced only at 0.1 @xmath46 m/s .",
    "the motion of the plate is controlled within @xmath50 m by a motorized linear stage ( newport corp .",
    ", linear stage m - utm50 , controller esp300 ) .",
    "the image of the meniscus is recorded with a ccd camera ( basler a602f , 656x492 pixels , pixel size : @xmath51 m x @xmath51 m , @xmath52  frames / s ) fitted with a macrophotography bellows and a nikon @xmath53 mm lens .",
    "we can thus obtain a magnification ratio of @xmath54 , in which case @xmath24 pixel in the image corresponds to @xmath55 m on the object plane .",
    "the location of the contact line is precisely determined by a cross - correlation procedure . the gray level profile corresponding to the unperturbed contact line",
    "is recorded for each experiment .",
    "this reference profile is then correlated with each vertical line of the image .",
    "the contact line position corresponds to the location of the correlation maximum .",
    "the location of this maximum is subsequently refined with subpixel resolution by interpolation around the correlation peak .",
    "this procedure is implemented as a plugin for the imagej software ( http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/ ) .",
    "let us briefly describe the hydrodynamic theory to which the experimental results will be compared .",
    "we basically follow the analysis of the accompanying paper , part 1 , @xcite , which is based upon the lubrication approximation for noninertial free surface flows  ( @xcite ) . however , to enable a _ quantitative _ comparison involving large contact angles , typically around @xmath56 , we include corrections to the standard lubrication theory as proposed by @xcite .",
    "the governing equations for the interface profile @xmath57 then become @xmath58 representing mass conservation and force balance respectively . here",

    "indeed , @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "we refer to part 1 for details on boundary conditions and the numerics of the linear stability analysis .",
    "the theory requires two input parameters characterizing the contact line : the slip length @xmath5 , preventing a stress divergence , and a microscopic contact angle @xmath67 . as argued in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] , we can use a value @xmath68 estimated from the molecular size .",
    "macroscopic results depend only logarithmically on the precise value of @xmath5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the microscopic contact angle is unknown a priori , but it is generally assumed to be equal to the equilibrium angle . for hysteretic systems , the static angle can take any value between @xmath69 and @xmath70 . since the results are quite sensitive to this parameter , we have produced numerical curves using three different values of @xmath67 : receding angle @xmath71 , advancing angle @xmath72 and average static angle @xmath73 .",

    "this relation implies that a perfectly wetting liquid can achieve a maximum rise of @xmath88 times the capillary length @xmath74 .",
    "when the plate is set withdrawn with a velocity @xmath89 , so that the contact line recedes with respect to the plate , the meniscus height increases to a new equilibrium value .",
    "the closed circles on figure  [ fig : zcl]a represent experimentally observed @xmath21 for various @xmath90 , showing an increase of the meniscus rise with @xmath75 .",
    "however , beyond a critical velocity , corresponding to a capillary number @xmath91 , the meniscus no longer equilibrates but rises indefinitely .",
    "this is the signature of the entrainment transition : in our experiments , steady menisci can not exist beyond @xmath92 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath21 on @xmath75 can be compared to the predictions of hydrodynamic theory . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : hydro ] , the numerical curves are quite sensitive to the boundary condition of the microscopic contact angle , @xmath67 . in figures  [ fig : zcl]a we therefore present numerical curves obtained using @xmath81 , @xmath83 and @xmath93 . the experimental points for @xmath94 lie between the curves obtained with @xmath69 and the average static angle .",
    "it should be noted that , while we can measure the _ relative _ contact line motion with a precision of a few microns , it is much more difficult to get the reference level of the liquid bath , inducing incertainty in the static angles .",
    "there is , however , an important discrepancy on the precise location of the transition : for all model parameters , the hydrodynamic theory predicts that the transition occurs when the meniscus reaches @xmath95 , the height attained by a perfectly wetting liquid ( part 1 , @xcite ) .",

    "interestingly , our data for @xmath22 can be directly compared with dynamic angle measurements for the same physico - chemical system , but for a different geometry , namely droplets sliding down an inclined plane ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : thetaca ] shows that the two sets of data for a receding contact line are very similar , suggesting that the dynamic contact angle has some universal features .",
    "one should be careful , however , since @xcite measure the _ actual _ slope of the interface at a fixed distance from the contact line , while definition ( [ eq : thetaapp ] ) represents an apparent slope when extrapolating static profiles .    while the behavior of the dynamic contact angle appears to be robust with respect to the large scale geometry ,",
    "the threshold ca for the entrainment transition is far from universal . in the experiments on sliding drops performed with the same substrate and liquids ,",
    "the rear of the drop assumes a conical shape such that receding contact lines move at a constant normal velocity ( @xcite ) .",

    "the dynamical evolution from the steady meniscus to the ridge solution provides crucial information on the wetting transition .",
    "figure  [ fig : bourrelet]a shows the time evolution of the meniscus height @xmath78 after setting the plate velocity at a constant value at @xmath122 . when @xmath123 , @xmath21 relaxes exponentially to a nearly flat plateau",
    ". note that we systematically observe a very slow upwards drift at a rescaled velocity @xmath124 , which is three orders of magnitude smaller than typical capillary numbers . above @xmath91 , the exponential relaxation",
    "is followed by a moderate steady rise and finally a much steeper rise corresponding to the development of the capillary ridge .",
    "indeed , figure  [ fig : zcl]b shows that there is a well - defined point at which the contact line velocity exceeds the `` noise '' level , which allows to identify the entrainment transition .    for @xmath110",
    ", liquid is entrained by the plate . as can be seen from the photograph of figure  [ fig : thetaca]c ,",
    "the interface dynamics is not trivial : immediately behind the contact line we observe the formation of a capillary ridge .",
    "we have found experimentally that this structure travels exactly at a speed @xmath91 , suggesting that the threshold of entrainment is determined by properties of the ridge ( @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the ridge consists of two flat films that are connected through a capillary shock . on the one hand",
    "the boundary conditions at the contact line select a film thickness @xmath125 , which is much thicker than the film connected to the bath , obeying the classical landau - levich scaling @xmath126 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this mismatch then gives rise to the shock .",
    "the picture that emerges is thus that , experimentally , entrainment occurs whenever the ridge can nucleate , even though stationary , linearly stable meniscus solutions in principle exist between @xmath91 and @xmath96 .",
    "we believe that this avoided critical behavior is due to intrinsic noise in the experiment : contact angle hysteresis is a manifestation of microscopic inhomogeneity , an effect that is not treated in the model .",
    "the observation that @xmath96 is sensitive to minor changes in the microscopic @xmath67 , and the presence of contact line drift even below the transition support this interpretation .",
    "let us now show how transient states during entrainment provide access to the full bifurcation structure of the wetting transition .",

    "surprisingly , all data points for various ca follow a single master curve .",
    "in addition , these points accurately follow the hydrodynamic prediction for the equilibrated values of @xmath21 versus @xmath75 ( solid line ) .",
    "let us stress that this correspondence is far from trivial , since the theory considers stationary rather than dynamical interface profiles .",
    "roughly speaking , one can identify ( i ) a stable branch ( @xmath131 ) on which all the steady menisci are located , ( ii ) an unstable branch ( @xmath132 ) where no steady menisci can exist , but where the we observe transients , and ( iii ) a vertical branch at @xmath133 corresponding to the velocity of the capillary ridge .",
    "the hydrodynamic theory predicts a slightly more complex structure with small oscillations around the vertical asymptote , which can not be resolved experimentally .",
    "in addition to this correspondence , the data from the transient menisci can be compared to the values of @xmath21 for steady menisci obtained at @xmath123 ( open circles , figure  [ fig : zcl]a ) . indeed ,",
    "the two data sets coincide , providing further evidence that transients states are similar in nature to the steady interface profiles .",
    "these experimental findings strongly suggest that entrainment proceeds through a succession of steady states , which we refer to as a _ quasi - steady _ dynamics .",
    "experimentally , the critical point ( with a vertical tangent on the @xmath94 curve ) is never reached through stationary menisci . however , _ during the transient _ the meniscus shapes follow the complete bifurcation curve , and therefore provides an indirect measurement of @xmath96 .",
    "the critical capillary number is found here to be @xmath134 , a slightly larger value than predicted by the hydrodynamic theory .     by chemical defects on the plate .",

    "having discussed the dynamics of unperturbed menisci we can address perturbations of the contact line . as originally suggested by golestanian & raphael , these should provide a sensitive experimental probe of small scale dynamics . in this section",
    "we consider two types of perturbations on the contact line : i ) spatially periodic perturbations with rows of equally spaced defects ( finite wavenumber @xmath1 ) , ii ) a global vertical shift of the meniscus ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "we first describe the experimental protocols , while the experimental findings results are discussed in the following section .      to assess the dispersion relation , @xmath0 versus @xmath1 , as a function of the contact line speed , we performed systematic experiments with periodically spaced defects .",
    "a horizontal row of defects is created on the solid plate , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] .",
    "when this row of defects moves through the meniscus , it entrains drops of silicone oil out of the bath . as the defects move away from the meniscus , the threads connecting the drops to the bath pinch off leaving a few satellite droplets ( figure  [ multidefautbrut]a ) .",
    "immediately after the release from the defects , the contact line has a spatially periodic perturbation with sharp peaks , which decay quickly leaving a smoother almost sinusoidal perturbation .",

    "for example , figure  [ multidefautbrut]a shows the pinch - off from four defects : on the top photograph , the rightmost liquid thread is clearly wider than the middle ones .",
    "it will then break slightly later . in the middle photograph ,",
    "the corresponding peak is sharper and higher . even after the decay of the highest spatial modes ,",
    "there is still a small difference between peak amplitudes ( figure  [ multidefautbrut]a , bottom photograph ) .",
    "for this reason it is impossible to fit the whole experimental curve with a single function and we choose to fit the curve by parts , considering only two defects at the same time ( figure  [ multidefautbrut]b ) .    to analyze the relaxation , the experimental profiles are fitted by the sum of three modes : @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the wavector corresponding to the spacing @xmath146 between defects .",
    "it can be seen on figures  [ multidefautfit ] that a single cosine function does not fit the experimental curves correctly while the three mode fit gives an accurate description : for a total amplitude of 15 @xmath46 m , the difference between the experimental points and the three mode fit is less than @xmath147 m . we thus obtain the dynamics of three different wavevectors in a single experiment .",
    "this procedure allows a very precise determination of the amplitude ( figure  [ fig : qmode]a ) , with a resolution exceeding the camera resolution .",
    "this is due to the averaging procedure which is implied by the fit over hundreds of data points .",

    "as expected from the quasi - static theory by golestanian & raphael , the moving contact line retains the peculiar elasticity already found for static lines , namely a relaxation rate proportional to the wavevector @xmath1 , in the limit @xmath207 .",

    "the initial interpretation for this was that the critical point is completely avoided through the nucleation of a capillary ridge ( @xcite ) .",

    "this demonstrates that a true hydrodynamic description is crucial to unravel the dynamics of contact lines .",
    "another conclusion of part 1 was that stationary menisci obey a rather surprising bifurcation diagram , that is characterized by two distinct capillary numbers , @xmath91 and @xmath96 .",
    "the experimentally observed transients towards liquid deposition were indeed found to exhibit the same structure ( figure  [ fig : bourrelet]b ) .",
    "there is , however , an important feature missing in the hydrodynamic description . experimentally , the entrainment transition occurs at @xmath91 , while in theory solutions are linearly stable up to @xmath96 .",
    "@xcite studied the entrainment transition for small siliconized glass rods pulled out of a bath of water - glycerin mixture . within their experimental uncertainty",
    ", they found that entrainment occurs when the meniscus height is very close to its maximum value , with corresponding values of @xmath22 ranging from 2 to 13@xmath209 and this is in contradiction with our results .",
    "it should be noted that their substrates exhibit a large variation of static contact angle ( from 70 to 86@xmath209 ) and the magnitude of hysteresis is not reported .",
    "it is thus not clear if the discrepancy with our results is due to the strong interface curvature in the third dimension or to hysteresis effects .",
    "a crucial step would be to incorporate substrate inhomogeneities into the theory .",
    "@xcite discussed the influence of fluctuations of surface energy ( directly correlated to hysteresis ) on the stability diagram for the wetting transition .",
    "they also predict , consistent with their quasi - static theory for smooth substrates , a roughening of the contact line at the coating transition since perturbations imposed by substrate heterogeneities should no longer relax .",
    "our experimental and theoretical findings suggest a rather different scenario at the wetting transition , and underline the need for a hydrodynamic description incorporating hysteresis .    experimentally , it is extremely difficult to get rid of hysteresis on solid substrates .",
    "there have been attempts to use nanostructured surfaces : for example , @xcite used mixed alkanethiol monolayers to create composite surfaces with an hysteresis for alcane droplets varying from 2 to 7@xmath209 .",
    "they interpreted their results of droplet spreading ( measuring an apparent contact angle as a function of time ) in terms of the molecular kinetic theory of blake ( @xcite ) .",
    "they obtained a friction coefficient for the contact line which was correlated to the average composition of the thiol monolayer . as we have shown , dynamic characteristics near transitions are much more sensitive tests than quantities like apparent contact angles which are furthermore ambiguously defined .",
    "it will thus be interesting to perform experiments similar to those presented here , on substrates of viscous liquids to try to eliminate the hysteresis completely , or on nano - patterned solid substrates to try to vary the hysteresis continuously .",
