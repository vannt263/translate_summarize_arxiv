    "the first photometry of v660 her reported in the literature was obtained by shugarov ( 1975 ) who observed the star in two outbursts in 1973 and 1974 .",
    "he estimated the photographic magnitude of the variable at maximum light as @xmath6 .",
    "in july 1995 , v660 her was observed during a long and bright outburst by spogli et al .",
    "the observed maximum was estimated to have been @xmath7 mag and the mean color indices were @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the light curve showed a linear decay with a rate of @xmath11 mag / day depending on the filter used .    a spectrum obtained by liu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed features typical for dwarf novae in minimum light .    in june and july 2001",
    "thorstensen and fenton ( 2003 ) obtained 58 spectra of v660 her in minimum light .",
    "the spectra showed single - peaked balmer lines which suggested a relatively low orbital inclination .",
    "the continuum indicated @xmath12 mag .",
    "a fit to the radial velocities derived from spectra of v660 her gave @xmath13 km / s and an orbital period of @xmath14 days ( @xmath15 min ) .",
    "the period being shorter than two hours and relatively large amplitude of the long outburst observed by spogli et al .",
    "( 1998 ) indicated that v660 her might be a member of su uma class of dwarf novae .",
    "recently , kato et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in the discussion of outburst parameters and superhump regrowth phenomenon in su uma stars presented unpublished data of v660 her from its 1995 and 1999 outburst indicating the presence of superhumps with a period of around 0.081 days .",
    ".journal of the ccd observations of v660 her .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ , > , > , < \" , ]     the least squares linear fit to the data from table 2 gives the following ephemeris for the maxima :    @xmath16    the @xmath17 values computed according to the ephemeris ( 1 ) are listed in table 2 and also shown in fig .",
    "it is clear that superhump period shows slight decreasing trend .",
    "it is confirmed by the second order polynomial fit to the moments of maxima which gives the following ephemeris :    @xmath18    finally , we can conclude that period of the superhumps was not stable during october 2004 superoutburst of v660 her and in the interval covered by our observations it was decreasing with a rate of @xmath19 .    combining both of our superhump period determinations returned its mean value which is equal to @xmath1 days ( @xmath2 min ) .",
    "in august 2003 we observed the star during six nights in quiescence .",
    "the runs were long enough to find orbital modulation in the light curves .",
    "the orbital period of v660 her is known and its value equal to @xmath14 day was determined by thorstensen and fenton ( 2003 ) .",
    "looking at the light curve of v660 her obtained on 2003 aug 03/04 and shown in fig .",
    "6 one can clearly see the wave in which maxima are separated by about 0.078 day .",
    "it means that the orbital hump is visible in the light curve of the star in quiescence and confirms the hypothesis of thorstensen and fenton ( 2003 ) that the binary has a relatively low inclination .",
    "the anova power spectrum computed for light curves from period aug 03/04 - aug 16/17 shows the presence of periodic or quasi - periodic signals which are manifested by a series of peaks in frequency range from 12 to 18 c / d .",
    "faintness of the star in quiescence and relatively short observing runs do not allow us to make a more sophisticated analysis .",
    "superhumps - the main characteristic of su uma stars - occur at a period slightly longer than the orbital period of the binary system . they are most probably a result of accretion disc precession caused by gravitational perturbations from the secondary",
    ". these perturbations are most effective when disc particles , moving on eccentric orbits , enter the 3:1 resonance .",
    "then the superhump period is simply the beat period between orbital and precession rate periods ( osaki 1985 ) :              from the observational point of view , it was first noticed by stolz & schoembs ( 1984 ) that @xmath21 grows with @xmath25 .",
    "7 shows the stolz & schoembs relation for ordinary su uma - type stars ( open circles ) and objects other than dwarf novae ( filled circles ) .",
    "data for this graph are taken from patterson ( 1998 ) , olech et al ( 2003a , 2004a ) and the newest alerts published in the vsnet archive ] .",
    "v660 her is plotted with a filled triangle .",
    "the period excess of the star is @xmath26 and according to the equation ( 5 ) this corresponds to the mass ratio @xmath5 .    until the mid of 1990 s all members of the su uma group seemed to show only negative superhump period derivatives ( warner 1995 )",
    "this was interpreted as a result of disk shrinkage during the superoutburst , thus lengthening its precession rate ( lubow 1992 ) .",
    "this picture became more complicated in 1997 when the first stars with @xmath27 were discovered ( semeniuk et al .",
    "1997 , olech 1997 ) .",
    "presently , we know even more complex behaviour as was shown by olech et al ( 2003b , 2004b ) who investigated the @xmath17 diagrams for ks uma , er uma , v1159 ori , cy uma , v1028 cyg , rz sge , sx lmi and tt boo and claimed that most ( probably almost all ) su uma stars show decreasing superhump periods at the beginning and the end of superoutburst but increasing period in the middle phase .",
    "recently , uemura et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggested that superhump period change might be connected with a presence of the precursor in the light curve of superoutburst .",
    "our observational coverage of superoutburst of v660 her is far from completeness especially in the first phase .",
    "the observed superhump period change equal to @xmath3 is typical for the last and longest stage of the superoutburst .",
    "thus the first two phases , in which the superhump period derivatives are at the beginning negative and further positive , could be not covered by our observations .    * acknowledgments . *",
    "we acknowledge generous allocation of the warsaw observatory 0.6-m telescope time .",
