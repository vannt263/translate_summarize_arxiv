    "the most important characteristic of granular media is the inelastic nature of the interparticle collisions .",

    "@xcite the coefficient of restitution is found to depend on velocity . when using molecular dynamics techniques  @xcite ad hoc phenomenological assumptions for the intergrain force laws",
    "are introduced .",
    "( for a recent review , see @xcite . )    several microscopic mechanisms for the decay of kinetic energy during collisions have been discussed .",
    "permanent plastic deformation of granular particles has been proposed as a possible mechanism for the removal of kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "viscoelastic behaviour was used to extend the theory of hertz @xcite to inelastic impact .",
    "one either invokes a phenomenological damping term in the equations of motion @xcite or uses a quasistatic approximation for low relative impact velocities @xcite .",
    "more recently temporary storage of energy in elastic modes @xcite has been discussed for one - dimensional rods . during collisions energy",
    "is exchanged between translational motion and internal degrees of freedom , whereas in between collisions the energy stored in the elastic modes decays . if the collision rate is high enough , which is frequently observed in simulations as a precursor for inelastic collapse , elastic energy may be transformed back into kinetic energy . thereby inelastic collapse is avoided and",
    "rich dynamics of temporary clusters is observed , including breakup and reformation of clusters as well as relaxation to a final state with all particles in contact  @xcite .",
    "the quantity controlling the fraction of kinetic energy , which is lost in a collision , is the coefficient of restitution @xmath0 .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to head - on , normal collisions , where @xmath0 is simply defined as the ratio of relative velocities after and before collision @xmath1 for perfectly elastic _",
    "one - dimensional _ rods phenomenological wave theory yields @xmath2 , independent of the relative velocity of the colliding rods . here",
    "@xmath4 denotes the length of the shorter ( longer ) rod . if both rods are identical we have @xmath5 always .",
    "using the approach of hertz , rayleigh @xcite has estimated , that the fraction of energy stored in the fundamental mode for two slowly colliding spheres is about @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the velocity of sound in a one - dimensional rod of the same material ) .",
    "while being quite small for many realistic scenarios his value for the coefficient of restitution thus depends on velocity and does not vanish for identical spheres .    in this paper",
    "we shall analyze collisions of two - dimensional elastic disks .",
    "starting from three - dimensional elastic objects , the two - dimensional case can be realized in two ways , called plane stress and plane strain  @xcite .",
    "plane stress describes the situation of thin plates , where the stress components on the faces of the plates disappear . with the additional assumption of in - plane oscillations only",
    ", the equations of two - dimensional elasticity apply . in the case of plane",
    "strain the end sections of a prismatic body are confined between smooth rigid planes , so that displacements in the axial direction are prevented .",
    "if the forces do not vary along the length for symmetry reasons , it may be assumed that there is no axial displacement anywhere .",
    "this again reduces the problem to two dimensions .",
    "it is easy to show that the equations for plane strain are the same as those for plane stress , provided one makes the substitution @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes young s modulus and @xmath10 poisson s number . for plane stress poisson s number",
    "@xmath10 has the three dimensional value and hence is restricted to @xmath11 . with the above transformation this corresponds to @xmath12 for plane strain . in particular values of @xmath10 close to 1 can be achieved for plane strain by materials with low shear modulus @xmath13 , like rubber .    as in our previous work for one - dimensional elastic rods  @xcite , we model the transfer of translational energy to elastic vibrations of two - dimensional disks and discuss the collision between two identical disks or equivalently the collision of one disk with a rigid wall",
    ". the interaction is modelled by a hard core potential depending on the instantaneous separation between the two disks .",
    "in contrast to the one - dimensional case the equations of motion for the elastic vibrations have to be solved numerically .",
    "the main result of our paper is the coefficient of restitution as a function of initial relative velocity and elastic properties of the disks , as shown in figure [ zweivgl ] .",
    "collisions are found to be elastic for vanishing relative velocity in agreement with hertz quasistatic approach @xcite and become increasingly inelastic for increasing relative velocity . for soft matter , characterized by a small value of the shear modulus",
    ", the elastic modes provide a rather effective mechanism for the uptake of kinetic energy during collision , so that the coefficient of restitution decreases with decreasing shear modulus .",
    "in contrast to one dimension , where the collision of two rods of equal length is always perfectly elastic @xcite , we find that the collision between two identical disks is in general inelastic .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ moden ]",
    "we discuss two - dimensional elasticity and calculate the eigenmodes of a disk with force free boundaries . in section [ koeffs ]",

    "the forces during the dynamical collision are considerably higher than in the quasistatic limit , because the compression is localized . the results of the dynamic calculation are shown for two initial velocities to demonstrate the approach towards the quasistatic case for the smaller initial velocity .    in the limit of small @xmath168 , eq .

    "are plotted with the force calculated from eq .",
    "( [ kraftvollst ] ) as a function of the initial velocities .",
    "the very slow divergence of the contact time with @xmath161 can be observed .",
    "the results for the contact time as obtained from the quasistatic calculation agree well with the numerical simulations of the full dynamic problem in the range of velocities were both methods apply .",
    "our aim is an approximate expression for the coefficient of restitution @xmath0 in the limit of small velocities @xmath155 .",
    "this can be achieved by using the quasistatic force law in the equations of motion .",
    "our approach is a generalization of rayleigh s @xcite , who derived the energy stored in the fundamental mode in the case of spheres .",
    "we replace the wall potential in ( [ hamiltonint ] ) by a potential @xmath200 , that acts only at the point @xmath201 of the boundary .",
    "this amounts to @xmath202 from hamilton s equations of motion we derive @xmath203 next we approximate @xmath204 by the force @xmath168 as calculated from ( [ kraftvollst ] ) . using the compact notation ( [ compact ] )",
    "we can write @xmath205 these equations can be integrated numerically with initial conditions @xmath206 . the energy which remains in the modes after collision is given by @xmath207    in figure [ contacenergy ]",
    "we show how much energy is stored in the modes for low @xmath155 .",
    "the quasistatic approximation agrees in magnitude with the result from the dynamical calculation .",
    "most of the energy goes into the quadrupolar mode .",
    "since the quasistatic approach is only correct to first order , the decreasing vibrational energy for @xmath208 is presumably unphysical .",
    "it was our aim to derive the coefficient of restitution as a function of velocity , starting from a microscopic model of simple objects with internal degrees of freedom , which can absorb part of the kinetic energy of translation .",
    "we have discussed in detail the head - on collision of two elastic disks , initially nonvibrating .",
    "this problem is equivalent to the collision of an elastic disk with a rigid wall , representing the plane of reflection symmetry of the two colliding disks .",
    "the dynamics of a collision has been formulated with help of hamilton s equations of motion for the normal coordinates of the elastic disk , interacting with a repulsive wall potential .",
    "the resulting dynamic equations were solved numerically for a finite number of modes and then extrapolated to the case of infinitely many modes .",
    "the main results are the following .",
    "in contrast to the quasistatic theory of hertz , the dynamic collision of two identical elastic spheres is inelastic in the sense that the relative velocity is decreased , corresponding to a coefficient of restitution smaller than one . the amount of translational energy which is converted to vibrational energy depends on relative velocity and poisson s number @xmath10 . the conversion is more effective for materials with low shear modulus , corresponding to a value of @xmath10 close to one . for high initial velocities the coefficent of restitution can be rather small , e.g. @xmath209 for @xmath210 and @xmath211 . in the quasistatic limit , @xmath161 ,",
    "collisions become more and more elastic .",
    "we have generalized the quasistatic approach of hertz and rayleigh to two dimensions and shown that the contact time @xmath198 diverges logarithmically as @xmath212 and the maximum deformation vanishes as @xmath213 .",
    "the dynamic approach agrees with the quasistatic theory in the regime , where both theories apply .",
    "we expect the collisions to be more strongly inelastic , if the two spheres have different size . for one - dimensional elastic rods we could show that the coefficient of restitution is strictly one , if the two rods have equal length , no matter whether vibrations are excited before collsion or not . in the latter case , when no vibrations are excited , the coefficient of restitution is given by the ratio of lenghts of the two rods .",
    "we are presently extending our calculations to disks of different radii .",
    "future perspectives include collisions of elastic spheres as well as more elaborate models of contact , e.g. including roughness .",
    "we thank timo aspelmeier , reiner kree , and peter mueller for interesting and helpful discussions .",
