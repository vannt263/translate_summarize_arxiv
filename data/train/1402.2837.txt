    "motivated by the ads / cft correspondence @xcite that thermodynamics of a black hole in ads space can be identified with that of dual strongly coupled conformal field theory on the boundary of the ads space , the thermodynamic properties of black holes in anti - de sitter ( ads ) space are researched recently . in ads space , the so - called hawking - page phase transition can occur between stable large black holes and thermal gas in ads space @xcite , which can well explain the confinement / deconfinement phase transition of gauge field @xcite .",
    "a decade ago , thermodynamics of the charged black holes in ads space was studied .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that , in a canonical ensemble the black hole system has a small / larger black hole ( sbh / lbh ) phase transition . with the increasing of the charge",
    ", such phase transition terminates at a critical point .",
    "the @xmath8 ( charge - chemical potential ) diagram of the charged black holes is quite similar to the @xmath9 ( pressure - volume ) diagram of the van der waals fluid @xcite .",
    "therefore the black hole system is shown to be analogous to the van der waals fluid .",
    "although the analogy between them is widely studied , it is somewhat problematic because that @xmath5 and @xmath10 are extensive and intensive quantities , while @xmath4 and @xmath11 are intensive and extensive quantities . on the other hand ,",
    "such phase transition of van der waals type can be also observed for asymptotically flat or de sitter charged black holes or black branes placed in a finite cavity @xcite .",
    "very recently , by interpreting the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic pressure and its conjugate quantity as a thermodynamic volume of the black hole @xcite , the analogy between the charged black hole in ads space and van der waals fluid was further enhanced @xcite .",
    "both systems were found to have the same critical exponents near the critical point and extremely similar phase diagrams .",
    "the problematic between @xmath8 and @xmath9 was modified .",
    "thus the analogy between the charged ads black hole and the van der waals system becomes more complete .",
    "this analogy has been generalized to different charged black holes and rotating black holes in ads space in the extended phase space @xcite .    among these studied",
    ", it was shown that besides the sbh / lbh first - order phase transition reminiscent of the liquid / gas transition of the van der waals fluid , there also appear some new interesting phenomena analogous to the  every day thermodynamics \" of simple substances , such as reentrant phase transitions of multicomponent liquids , multiple first - order solid / liquid / gas phase transitions , and liquid / gas phase transitions of the van der waals type .",
    "it was shown that in all @xmath12 dimensions the single spinning vacuum kerr - ads black holes demonstrate the peculiar behavior of lbh / sbh / lbh phase transitions reminiscent of reentrant phase transitions @xcite .",
    "such reentrant phase transition was also found in the four - dimensional born - infeld - ads black hole spacetimes , deep in the nonlinear regime of the born - infeld theory .",
    "however , for the higher dimensional born - infeld ads black holes , such phase transition was not observed @xcite .",
    "more intriguingly , the multiply rotating kerr - ads black hole system displays a small / intermediate / large black hole ( sbh / ibh / lbh ) phase transition with one tricritical and two critical points in some range of the parameters @xcite .",
    "it was argued in refs .",
    "@xcite that the new phase structure in the thermodynamics of rotating black holes resembles to binary fluids seen in superfluidity and superconductivity .",
    "more recently , the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite also pointed out that the reentrant phase transitions are observed for the asymptotically flat doubly - spinning myers - perry black holes of vacuum einstein gravity .",
    "hence , neither exotic matter nor a cosmological constant is required for this phenomenon to occur in black hole spacetimes .",
    "the aim of this paper is to search for the possible triple points and sbh / ibh / lbh black hole transitions in the charged gauss - bonnet ( gb ) black holes in ads space .",
    "in fact , in our previous work @xcite , we studied the @xmath8 criticality for the charged gb black holes .",
    "we ignored a subtle thing that worthwhile to note here : we found that the black hole system undergoes two phase transitions of the van der waals type at one isotherm in some ranges of the parameter ( see table i in ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "this in other words implies a reentrant phase transition or a triple point .",
    "it is the partial aim of this paper to examine such phase transition . considering the problematic of the analogy between the analogy of @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    ", we will do it in the extended phase space , where the cosmological constant appears as a dynamical pressure of the system and its conjugate quantity is the thermodynamic volume of the black holes .",
    "the result indicates that there indeed exists the sbh / ibh / lbh black hole transition in the case of @xmath6 and @xmath7 . and",
    "the triple point is also found , at which the sbh , ibh , and lbh can coexist .",
    "for the other values of the parameters , the phase diagrams are also obtained , which reveals that the sbh / lbh phase transition is ubiquitous .",

    "finally , combined with the behavior of the gibbs free energy , the phase diagram will be obtained .    using this method",
    ", we studied the phase diagram for the full range of the parameter charge @xmath5 .",
    "it was shown that the sbh / lbh phase transition exists in any dimension of @xmath0 . however , in six - dimensional spacetime , the phase diagram is more subtle . in some range of the parameters ,",
    "there are three critical points for a fixed charge @xmath5 , and @xmath80 has four roots . in such range ,",
    "the gibbs free energy displays the behavior of two swallow tails .",
    "however , the triple point does not always exist in that range ( i.e. , in the range iv shown in fig .",
    "[ pd6pq ] ) . the triple point and the sbh / ibh / lbh phase transition",
    "are limited in the black dashed line @xmath122 in fig .",

    "thus we observe triple point and reentrant sbh / ibh / lbh phase transition in the charged gb - ads black holes .",

    "we only dealt with the case with fixed charge @xmath5 .",
    "one may wonder what happens when the pressure @xmath4 is fixed .",

    "the black hole system will encounter the similar structure of critical point for fixed @xmath5 with the increasing of @xmath4 or for fixed @xmath4 with the increasing of @xmath5 .",
    "so the result is similar to the case with fixed charge @xmath5 .",
    "we remark that in the charged gb - ads black holes , we observed the existence of the triple point and the multiple first - order solid / liquid / gas phase transitions , and liquid / gas phase transitions of the van der waals type , analogous to the  every day thermodynamics \" .",
