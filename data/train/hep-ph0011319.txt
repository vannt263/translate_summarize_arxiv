    "here we discuss a recent description @xcite of soft diffraction in high energy @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) collisions which embodies    * _ pion - loop _ insertions in the bare pomeron pole , which represent the nearest singularity generated by @xmath6-channel unitarity , * a _ two - channel eikonal _ which incorporates the pomeron cuts generated by elastic and quasi - elastic ( with @xmath7 intermediate states ) @xmath8-channel unitarity , * high - mass _ diffractive dissociation_.    to implement ( i ) , we follow anselm and gribov @xcite and write the pomeron trajectory @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the _ bare _ trajectory and where the pion - loop insertions are given by @xmath11,\\ ] ] with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath14 specifies the @xmath15 total cross section and @xmath16 is the form factor of the pion - pomeron vertex .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath17 in ( [ eq : a1 ] ) is small but , due to the tiny scale @xmath18 , the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath17 is steep and non - linear . in this way",
    "we correctly reproduce the behaviour of the diffractive amplitude in the _ peripheral _ region .    note that @xmath17 of ( [ eq : a2 ] ) has been renormalized @xcite such that @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the full pion - loop contribution .",
    "the value of @xmath21 is determined by large virtualities of the pion , which are controlled by the scale @xmath22 .",
    "for this reason the contribution , @xmath23 has been included in @xmath24 , which describes the _ small size _ @xmath25 component of the pomeron .",
    "the above model describes the data on the total and differential elastic cross section throughout the isr - tevatron energy interval , see @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , we found the bare pomeron parameters to be @xmath26 on the other hand it is known that the same data can be described by a simple effective pomeron pole with @xcite @xmath27 in our approach the shrinkage of the diffraction cone comes not from the bare pole ( @xmath28 ) , but has components from the three ingredients , ( i)(iii ) , of the model . that is , in the isr - tevatron energy range @xmath29 from the @xmath30-loop , @xmath8-channel eikonalization and diffractive dissociation respectively .",
    "moreover eikonal rescattering suppresses the growth of the cross section and so @xmath31 .",
    "note that at lower energies the fixed target data require @xmath32 @xcite , which is consistent since as the energy decreases the effect of the eikonal and higher mass diffractive dissociation is less than in ( [ eq : a7 ] ) .",
    "it is important to discuss the results for the behaviour of the local slope of the forward elastic peak @xmath33 the @xmath30-loop insertions lead to a contribution to @xmath34 which increases as @xmath35 ( and behaves as @xmath36 ) .",
    "on the other hand the eikonal absorptive corrections lead to a dip in @xmath37 whose position moves to smaller @xmath38 as @xmath39 increases , which causes @xmath34 to decrease as @xmath40 .",
    "fortunately just at the lhc energy , these two effects compensate each other and @xmath41 is essentially independent of @xmath6 for @xmath42 @xcite .    the solid and dashed curves in fig .",
    "1 show , respectively , the energy behaviour of the slope @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( for the maximal  model of @xcite ) .",
    "we plot @xmath45 in @xmath46 and @xmath41 in gev@xmath47 , since in these units the asymptotic black - disc limit takes , to a good approximation , the simple form @xmath48 . for comparison the dotted lines show the simple effective pomeron results of @xcite .",
    "it is clearly seen that , while the simple and detailed models give similar values of @xmath45 up to lhc energies , the predictions for the slope @xmath43 already differ significantly .",
    "since our model @xcite embodies all the main features of soft diffraction we expect it to give reliable predictions for the _ survival probability _ @xmath49 of the rapidity gaps against population by secondary hadrons from the underlying event , that is hadrons originating from soft rescattering .",
    "in particular we predict @xmath50 for single diffractive events and @xmath51 for exclusive higgs boson production @xmath52 at tevatron ( lhc ) energies .",
    "it is informative to recall the origin of the eikonal rescattering corrections , ingredient ( ii ) of our model .",
    "multi - pomeron vertices are complicated objects which are not closely related to @xmath54 , as represented by the two - pomeron exchange diagram of fig",
    ".  2(a ) . indeed fig .",
    "2(a ) vanishes as @xmath55 due to the cancellation between the cut shown by line 1 with those shown by lines 2 and 3 @xcite .",
    "rather the true two - pomeron vertex is given by the mandelstam crossed  diagram of fig .",
    "2(b ) @xcite and , moreover , it can not be too small .",
    "the reason is that the inelastic cuts 2 , 3 of fig .",
    "2(a ) give a _ negative _ cross section @xmath56 for single diffractive dissociation ( of the upper hadron ) which is exactly cancelled by the positive elastic contribution of cut 1 .",
    "so to obtain a positive @xmath57 we require the contribution fig .",
    "2(b ) to be larger than @xmath54 ( cut 1 of fig .",
    "in general the multi - pomeron vertex corresponds to the complete set of 4-leg  proton - pomeron diagrams which possess both @xmath8- and @xmath58-channel cuts simultaneously .",
    "2(b ) is the simplest such diagram .",
    "moreover it gives the leading order @xmath59 contribution , and illustrates the main properties of the two pomeron vertex .",
    "an analogous result follows for multi - pomeron exchanges .",
    "we conclude that the absorptive correction due to @xmath8-channel rescattering , fig .",
    "2(b ) , can not be smaller than that given by the elastic eikonal @xcite ; that is @xmath60 is the minimal correction to the elastic amplitude and @xmath61 is the correction for the inelastic cross section .",
    "to describe the data , our _ bare _ pomeron , in the _ absence _ of pion - loop insertions , has @xmath62 see ( [ eq : a5 ] ) with ( [ eq : a4 ] ) subtracted . in terms of qcd , does this mean the bare pomeron is described by two - gluon exchange @xmath63 _ la _ low and nussinov @xcite ?",
    "in fact , the situation is more complicated , since at scale @xmath64 we have multi - gluon exchange and probably gluon saturation , as in the black - disc limit .",
    "rather , @xmath28 , means that the bare pomeron has no @xmath65 dependence and lives in @xmath66 dimensions , where the froissant bound corresponds to a fixed bare pole with @xmath67 .",
    "this picture is very similar to the heavy  pomeron proposed by gribov @xcite . at first sight , for a fixed pole @xmath67",
    ", it is impossible to obtain a mass spectrum for glueballs which are believed to lie on the pomeron trajectory . indeed in pure gluodynamics",
    "( without quarks and pions ) we would then have no glueballs .",
    "this is in accord with gribov s claim that there is no confinement in a world without light quarks @xcite .",
    "however , we have to account for the @xmath6-channel unitarity iterations when quarks ( and pions , which are the chiral phase of the light quark fields ) exist . as seen above , the pion - loop insertion shifts @xmath24 and",
    "produces a non - zero @xmath68 .",
    "next , as emphasized in @xcite , there is an important mixing between the pomeron and the bare @xmath69 $ ] meson trajectories in the time - like @xmath70 domain . after mixing",
    ", the leading pomeron trajectory follows the original @xmath71-trajectory in the time - like domain - pomeron mixing is negligible and @xmath68 is small . ] .",
    "therefore the expected glueball masses should be similar to those predicted in @xcite ( which , in turn , agrees with lattice expectations ) .",
