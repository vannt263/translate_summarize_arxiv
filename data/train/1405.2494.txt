    "the concept was introduced in the late 19th century by the american philosopher charles sander peirce as an inference scheme aimed at deriving potential explanations of observations .",
    ", is observed ; but if @xmath0 were true , @xmath1 would be a matter of course : hence , there is reason to suspect that @xmath0 is true . '' ] a general characteristic of abductive reasoning is the existence of multiple abductive explanations , which are typically not equally compelling . therefore",
    ", identifying a subclass , possibly narrow , of `` preferred explanations '' is an important problem . following the occam s principle ,",
    "a typical approach is to identify as `` preferred '' those explanations that are , in some sense , _",
    "simple_. several concepts of simplicity were considered in the literature , most notably those based on minimality with respect to inclusion and cardinality . in the context of logic programming ,",
    "abduction was first studied by eshghi and kowalski , and then by kakas and mancarella under the _ brave reasoning _ variant of the stable - model semantics . that work established _ abductive logic programming _ as an important subarea of abduction , where the background theory is represented by a logic program , often with negation in the bodies and disjunction in the heads , under any of the standard logic programming semantics @xcite .",
    "this paper is concerned with the problem of limiting the space of explanations in the framework of abductive logic programming extended by integrity constraints .",
    "we introduce a new measure of the quality of an explanation in terms of its _ arbitrariness _ and propose to consider as `` preferred '' only those explanations that minimize arbitrariness .",
    "our approach can be applied with any of the standard semantics of logic programs .",
    "let us consider the following scenario .",
    "it is saturday and bob is known to ski on saturdays if it is not snowing . and when he is not skiing , he is on campus .",
    "we can represent this information by the logic program :    \\ { @xmath2   @xmath3   @xmath4 }    if it s saturday and we see bob on campus , we can abduce it is snowing .",
    "otherwise , bob would be skiing . to put it differently , given our background knowledge , the fact @xmath5 is an abductive explanation ( explanations will be formally defined in the next section ) to our observation @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7    in this example , there is only one explanation of the observation ( assuming all that is relevant to our reasoning has been mentioned ) .",
    "however , a general feature of abductive reasoning is the existence of _ multiple _ explanations .",
    "typically , they are not all equally likely .",
    "thus , narrowing down the range of possible explanations to a smaller set of `` most likely '' or `` preferred '' ones becomes an important problem .",
    "the key to it is a well - motivated notion of `` preferred '' .",
    "we will now present an example meant to develop intuitions behind the notion of `` preferredness '' .",
    "[ cont - motivating - example ] let us consider the following scenario modeling security breaches in an information system .",
    "a security breach at a component of the system may only occur when a person with an account makes an unauthorized access .",
    "regular staff personnel have accounts on the system if they complete training and have their security clearance current .",
    "visitors may also be granted an account but only with an approval by the head of the it department .",
    "this situation can be described by the following program : @xmath8 let us also assume that @xmath9 and @xmath10 are regular staff members and @xmath11 is a visitor ( there may also be other individuals in these groups and additional ones not mentioned as staff or visitors in the program ) , and that the system has information that @xmath9 completed training .",
    "that is , the program also contains facts @xmath12 if we observe @xmath13 ( the security of @xmath14 was compromised ) , there are several possible explanations .",
    "below we list some of them :    @xmath15 @xmath16 the key question is whether there are principled ways to eliminate some of these explanations as less likely than others .",
    "@xmath7    most approaches to the problem of selecting preferred explanations follow the occam s principle of parsimony that entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily and that among possible explanations the simplest one tends to be the right one .",
    "the first part of that principle is non - controversial .",
    "however , simplicity is a notoriously complex concept and different formalizations of it are possible !",
    "they range from the standard one based on the subset minimality , to its versions and refinements that require minimum cardinality , minimum weight , or minimality under prioritization of individual hypotheses @xcite . in our example , the explanations @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , are subset minimal and so , _ preferred _ under the subset minimality criterion .",
    "the explanations @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are not .",
    "if we use a more restrictive criterion of minimum cardinality , the preferred explanations are @xmath17 and @xmath21 .",
    "let us assume that there are reasons to view each of them as wrong ( @xmath9 and @xmath11 can conclusively demonstrate they were not involved ) . under the subset minimality criterion",
    ", we now prefer explanations @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , while under the minimum cardinality criterion @xmath18 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , are preferred .",
    "let us look more carefully at these last two types of explanations .",
    "they are specific in that they speak about concrete individuals .",
    "however , the explanations of the latter type select an _",
    "arbitrary _ individual in the domain ( explicitly mentioned or not , as long as it is not @xmath11 ) , with no particular reason to choose one over another .",
    "in other words , investigators of the security breach would have no reason to start their investigation with any particular person and the person they would consider first would be arbitrarily selected . on the other hand ,",
    "the explanation @xmath21 connects the structural information present in the program and the knowledge provided by the observation in a non - arbitrary ( _ constrained _ ) way  it `` invents '' no new entities and makes no arbitrary assumptions .",
    "arguably , it would be the explanation pursued first by the investigators .",
    "one might argue that the family of explanations @xmath22 simply points to the _ existence _ of a person who managed to pass as a visitor with an approval for an account and made an unauthorized access to the it system , and that this family of explanations can be represented as a single explanation involving existentially quantified formulas ( along the lines of an early work by pople )",
    ". however , such `` existential '' explanations while no longer making arbitrary choices lack _",
    "specificity_.    in this paper we develop these intuitions into a formal measure of the quality of explanations based on how arbitrary they are . to this end , we introduce the notion of the _ degree of arbitrariness _ of an explanation : the smaller that value , the less arbitrary the explanation .",
    "we define _ constrained _ explanations as those with 0 degrees of arbitrariness , and propose them as _",
    "preferred_. our most significant technical results establish the computational complexity of the problems to decide whether a given explanation is constrained , and whether a constrained explanation exists .",
    "we study the two problems for the case when programs modeling background knowledge in abductive theories are stratified .",
    "this is a common case in abductive logic programming . from the technical standpoint it has two interesting aspects .",
    "first , the two main semantics of logic programs , the stable - model semantics @xcite and the well - founded semantics @xcite , as well as several others ( but not the supported - model semantics @xcite ) collapse in this case .",
    "second , when the background knowledge is modeled by a stratified program under the stable - model semantics , all general semantics - independent schemas to define aductive explanations yield the same result .",
    "we show that for abductive theories with stratified logic programs , the two computational problems mentioned above are conp - complete and @xmath27-complete , respectively . by considering special classes of stratified programs",
    ", we establish the main sources of the complexity of the problem .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized into five sections .",
    "first , we recall basic concepts of abductive logic programming and discuss four general schemata to define explanations .",
    "next , we introduce the key concepts for the paper : the degree of arbitrariness in an explanation , and then arbitrary and constrained explanations .",
    "the following section presents our main complexity results .",
    "next , we discuss related work where , in particular , we note that our results are also relevant in the area of view update repairs .",
    "we conclude by summarizing our contributions and pointing out problems for future work .",
    "we consider a fixed vocabulary @xmath28 consisting of relation and constant symbols ( no function symbols ) .",
    "we write @xmath29 for the set of constants in @xmath28 and assume that @xmath29 is an infinite countable set ( in some examples , for the sake of simplicity of presentation , we take @xmath29 to be finite ) .",
    "we write @xmath30 for the set of predicate symbols in @xmath28 . for @xmath31 , we define @xmath32 to be the set of all ground atoms whose predicate symbols are in @xmath33 . in particular , @xmath34 is the herbrand base of @xmath28 .",
    "by @xmath35 we denote a semantics of logic programs .",
    "for now we do not commit to any particular semantics . as usual , we assume only that @xmath35 is given in terms of herbrand interpretations of @xmath28 , that is , subsets of @xmath34 . for a logic program @xmath36 ( in the vocabulary @xmath28 ) ,",
    "we denote by @xmath37 the set of herbrand interpretations of @xmath28 that are models of @xmath36 according to the semantics @xmath35 .",
    "since @xmath28 is fixed , we omit it from the notation .",
    "the most common choice for @xmath35 is the stable - model semantics @xcite .",
    "we now recall the concept of an abductive theory in the logic programming setting .    an _ abductive theory _ @xmath38 over a vocabulary @xmath28 is a triple @xmath39 , where    * @xmath36 is a finite logic program over @xmath28 * @xmath40 is a finite set of predicate names called the _ abducible predicates _ * @xmath41 is a finite set of first - order sentences over @xmath28 called _ integrity constraints _ ,    and where every rule in @xmath36 with an abducible predicate in the head is a ground fact .",
    "@xmath7    informally , the program @xmath36 and the integrity constraints @xmath41 provide a model ( description ) of the problem domain .",
    "the program @xmath36 defines non - abducible predicates ( those not in @xmath42 ) in terms of abducible predicates ( those in @xmath42 ) .",
    "the integrity constraints in @xmath41 impose domain constraints on abducible and non - abducible predicates in the language . according to the definition , information about abducible predicates",
    "is given in terms of ground facts .",

    "we refer to ground atoms based on abducible predicates as _",
    "an _ observation _ is a set of ground facts based on _ non - abducible _ predicates .",
    "an observation may `` agree '' with the program @xmath36 and the integrity constraints @xmath41 .",
    "but if it does not , we assume that this `` disagreement '' is caused by the incorrect information about the properties modeled by the _",
    "abducible _ predicates .",
    "abductive reasoning consists of inferring updates to the set of abducibles in the program ( removal of some and inclusion of some new ones ) so that the updated program , the integrity constraints and the observation `` agree . ''",
    "each update that yields an agreement constitutes a possible _ explanation _ of the observation .",

    "abduction was introduced to artificial intelligence in early 1970s by harry pople jr .",
    ", where it is now commonly understood as the _ inference to the best explanation _ @xcite . over the years several criteria have been proposed to identify the preferred ( best ) explanations , all rooted in the occam s razor parsimony principle .",
    "the most commonly considered one is subset - minimality @xcite .",
    "a more restrictive condition of minimum cardinality has also been broadly studied @xcite . the abduction reasoning formalism we study in the paper uses logic programs to represent background knowledge in abductive theories .",
    "it is referred to as _ abductive logic programming _ @xcite .",
    "abductive explanations which allow the removal of hypotheses are first introduced by inoue and sakama .",
    "the importance of abductive logic programming to knowledge representation was argued by denecker and schreye .",
    "it was applied in diagnosis @xcite , planning @xcite , natural language understanding @xcite , and case - based reasoning @xcite .",
    "denecker and kakas provide a comprehensive survey of the area .",
    "the complexity of abductive reasoning was first studied by bylander et al . .",
    "eiter et al .",
    "studied the complexity of reasoning tasks in the abductive logic programming setting .",
    "the profusion of abductive explanations was explicitly noted by maher in his work on constraint abduction .",
    "maher considers a differennt setting and handles the problem by different techniques .",
    "the key similarity is that in maher s setting , as in ours , symbols from the vocabulary not present in the theory can give rise to alternative explanations .",
    "none of the earlier works on abduction considered the concepts of constrainedness or arbitrariness .",
    "these concepts were proposed by us for the setting of view updates in deductive databases @xcite .",
    "view updating consists of modifying base relations to impose properties on view relations , that is , relations defined on the database by queries .",
    "the subject has received much attention in database research ( cf .",
    "the survey papers by fraternali and paraboschi , and mayol and teniente ) .",
    "there is a natural connection between view updating and abduction @xcite .",
    "the view plays the role of the background theory , all base relation symbols are abducible predicates , and requests for a view update are observations .",
    "the role of integrity constraints is the same in both areas .",
    "however , there is an important distinction here . in view updating ,",
    "integrity constraints concern only base relation , a restriction not present in abductive settings .",
    "our present work adapts the notions of constrainedness and arbitrariness to the more general setting of abduction .",
    "importantly , we introduce the new concept of the degree of arbitrariness , which allows us to compare explanations even when no constrained explanations exist .",
    "we proposed a new approach to limiting the space of explanations in abductive logic programming extended by integrity constraints .",
    "specifically , we introduced the degree of arbitrariness as a measure of the quality of an explanation .",
    "it imposes a hierarchy on the space of explanations ( possibly already narrowed down by means of other principles ) : the lower the degree of arbitrariness , the more compelling an explanation .",
    "explanations with the degree of arbitrariness equal to 0 are particularly important .",
    "we presented a detailed account of the complexity of reasoning with constrained explanations when programs in abductive theories are stratified . in our discussion in sections 2 and 3 we were implicitly assuming that the set @xmath181 consisted of two - valued interpretations .",
    "however , our definitions can also be extended to the three - valued well - founded semantics . moreover , since for stratified programs the well - founded and the stable - model semantics coincide , all complexity results we obtained hold for that case , too .",
    "finally , our approach applies to each of the four basic models of abductive reasoning , three of which have been studied before , with the remaining one ( definition [ def3 ] ) to the best of our knowledge being new .",
    "our discussion and the results suggest that the notions of the degree of arbitrariness and constrainedness are important additions to the space of fundamental principles of abductive reasoning .",
    "we note , however , that as with other principles there are situations where the minimum degree of arbitrariness may not be the appropriate principle to use for abduction .",
    "for example , let us consider the transitive closure program containing two rules : @xmath182 with an abducible predicate @xmath183 .",
    "if we observe @xmath184 , the explanation @xmath185 is constrained while @xmath186 is arbitrary ( @xmath187 can be replaced by any constant in the vocabulary of the language ) .",
    "thus , according to the minimum degree of arbitrariness criterion , @xmath188 is preferred to @xmath189 . however , if the relation @xmath190 is the ancestor relation , @xmath183 is the parent relation and @xmath191 is observed , preferring the constrained explanation @xmath192 to @xmath193 , which is arbitrary , may be a point of dispute . establishing conditions to help decide which criteria to use when is a grand challenge of the area of abduction .",
    "for the example we just gave , we note that the minimum cardinality principle would give the same result as the minimum arbitrariness one and would be open to the same question .",
    "our work opens several avenues for future research .",
    "first , we do not have a clear picture of the complexity of the case of abductive theories with non - recursive horn programs and with integrity constraints restricted only to abducible predicates .",
    "this case is of interest due to its view updating applications .",
    "next , there is a challenging problem of resolving the complexity of reasoning with constrained explanations in the case of abductive theories with arbitrary programs .",

    "say @xmath480 , we have that replacing @xmath108 with @xmath112 in @xmath166 results in an explanation .    if on the other hand , the number of abducibles with predicate symbols of positive arity in @xmath62 is less than or equal to @xmath87 , then the total number of constants occurring in all abducibles in @xmath62 is bounded by a constant @xmath481 dependent on @xmath178 only ( independent of the size of input , that is , of the size of @xmath65 ) .",
    "thus , there is only a fixed number of possible selections of occurrences of a constant for replacement by a new symbol @xmath112 . for each of them",
    ", we can test in polynomial time whether it leads to an explanation .",
    "thus , we can decide whether @xmath175 is constrained in polynomial time .",
    "\\(2 ) if @xmath175 is a constrained explanation , then @xmath289 is a constrained explanation .",
    "moreover , we can assume that @xmath62 contains all zero arity abducibles in @xmath65 .",
    "thus , each such constrained explanation is determined by its non - zero arity abducibles .",
    "non - zero arity abducibles in a constrained explanation use only constants appearing in @xmath51 and @xmath482 ( theorem [ relevant ] ) .",
    "it follows , the set of all possible non - zero arity abducibles that might be chosen to form @xmath62 has size that is polynomial in the size of @xmath65 ( the input size ) . since by an argument from the previous proof , we can assume that @xmath62 contains no more than @xmath87 non - zero arity abducibles ( where @xmath87 is a constant depending only on @xmath178 ) , the set of all candidate explanations that need to be tested to decide the problem is polynomial in the size of input .",
    "since each such candidate explanation can be tested for constrainedness in polynomial time ( by the previous result ) , the assertion follows ."
