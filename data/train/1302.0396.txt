    "<S> three dimensional topological insulator crystals consist of an insulating bulk enclosed by metallic surfaces , and detailed theoretical predictions about the surface state band topology and spin texture are available @xcite . while several topological insulator materials are currently known , the existence and topology of these metallic states have only ever been probed for one particular surface orientation of a given material . for most topological insulators , such as bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 and bi@xmath2se@xmath3 , this surface is the closed - packed ( 111 ) surface and it supports one topologically guaranteed surface state dirac cone . </S>",
    "<S> here we experimentally realise a non closed - packed surface of a topological insulator , bi@xmath0sb@xmath1(110 ) , and probe the surface state topology by angle - resolved photoemission . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , this surface also supports metallic states but the change in surface orientation drastically modifies the band topology , leading to three dirac cones instead of one , in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions @xcite but in contrast to any other experimentally studied ti surface . </S>",
    "<S> this illustrates the possibility to tailor the basic topological properties of the surface via its crystallographic direction . here </S>",
    "<S> it introduces a valley degree of freedom not previously achieved for topological insulator systems .    for the topological insulator ( ti ) </S>",
    "<S> surfaces studied so far , the predicted fermi contour consists of an odd number of dirac cones around the brillouin zone centre @xmath4 ( see e.g. refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) but more complex scenarios with dirac cones around three translation invariant momenta ( trims ) have been predicted for non-(111 ) surfaces of bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 @xcite and for smb@xmath5(001 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of such a scenario is closely linked to the bulk electronic structure of a ti : if the bulk parity inversion only takes place at the brillouin zone centre @xmath6 , this leads to an odd number of closed fermi contours around the surface brillouin zone centre @xmath4 for every possible surface orientation , but if the bulk parity inversion happens at another bulk trim , one should be able to change the surface state topology by choosing different surface orientations . </S>",
    "<S> candidates for ti materials allowing this are bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 ( parity inversion at every bulk trim except l @xcite ) , pbbi@xmath2te@xmath7 ( parity inversion at z @xcite ) and sbb@xmath5 ( parity inversion at x @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , surface state topology investigations by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) have only been performed for surfaces with a topologically predicted single dirac cone around @xmath4 . indeed , only one surface orientation for a given ti has so far been probed , such that even the basic expectation of a bulk material completely enclosed by metallic surfaces still needs to be verified . </S>",
    "<S> experiments for other surface orientations are lacking due to the difficulty of preparing such surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> feasible methods for preparing ti surfaces are cleaving @xcite , a combination of cutting , polishing and _ in situ _ cleaning , as well as epitaxial growth @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while cleaving and epitaxial growth have so far only been used to prepare the very stable ( 111 ) surface ( except for the cubic hgte(001 ) ) , cutting and _ in situ _ cleaning could in principle give any desired surface direction , but the approach is hindered by the small size of crystals , their strong anisotropy and the high likelihood to off - set the delicate stoichiometry near the surface during the _ in situ _ cleaning process .    here </S>",
    "<S> we show that an epitaxial film of the topological insulator bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 can be grown in the ( 110 ) orientation by evaporating a mixture of bi and sb on a bi(110 ) surface . since @xmath8 is quite small in the ti phase ( @xmath9 ) </S>",
    "<S> , the lattice mismatch between the bi substrate and the film is so small @xcite that the growth is quasi - homoepitaxial , resulting in a high - quality bi@xmath0sb@xmath1(110 ) film . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](a ) shows the fermi contour for a film of bi@xmath10sb@xmath11(110 ) measured by arpes ( i.e. the photoemission intensity at the fermi level ) and it is immediately obvious that for this surface three trims are enclosed by fermi contours : @xmath12 and @xmath13 , in sharp contrast to the ( 111 ) surface of this ti where only the @xmath4 point is enclosed by an odd number of fermi contours .    before discussing the experimental results in more detail </S>",
    "<S> , we briefly review the theoretical predictions for the bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 surfaces by teo , fu and kane @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their approach and its results are illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](c)-(e ) . </S>",
    "<S> the parity invariants @xmath14 for the eight bulk time - reversal invariant momenta ( trims ) @xmath15 in bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 are all found to be @xmath16 , except for the bulk l point where @xmath17 for bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 with ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> the surface fermion parity @xmath20 for each surface trim determines the topology of the surface fermi contour . </S>",
    "<S> it can be calculated from a projection of the bulk parity invariants using the relation @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the number of occupied , spin - degenerate bulk bands , i.e. 5 for bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure is illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](c ) together with the bulk and surface brillouin zones . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted surface fermion parity values for the surface trims of the ( 111 ) and ( 110 ) surfaces in the ti state ( @xmath18 ) are also shown . </S>",
    "<S> the surface fermion parity values for the surface trims immediately give the topological prediction for the fermi contour : the trim should be enclosed by an odd number of contours for @xmath23 and by an even or no contour for @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the topologically expected closed contours are marked by blue circles . </S>",
    "<S> bi@xmath0sb@xmath1(111 ) shows one such contour in the surface brillouin zone whereas bi@xmath0sb@xmath1(110 ) has three . </S>",
    "<S> the topological predictions for bi@xmath0sb@xmath1(110 ) and bi(110 ) are compared in fig . [ fig:1](d ) and ( e ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum phase transition to a ti at @xmath25 changes the bulk fermion parity for the @xmath26 point from @xmath16 to @xmath27 and this leads to a surface fermion parity change at @xmath28 : for bi@xmath0sb@xmath1(110 ) one expects to find an odd number of fermi level crossings between @xmath28 and any other trim whereas there would be an even number for bi(110 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that such a rich surface state topology would not be expected for a non-(111 ) surface of most other topological insulators ( e.g. bi@xmath2se@xmath3 ) because there the bulk parity inversion happens only at the @xmath6 point ( @xmath29 ) , which , combined with the even @xmath22 , leads to merely an odd number of closed contours around the @xmath4 point of the surface , as illustrated for bi@xmath2se@xmath3(110 ) in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](f ) .     </S>",
    "<S> +    the measured fermi surfaces for bi(110 ) and bi@xmath10sb@xmath11(110 ) are shown in fig . [ fig:1](a ) and ( b ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> they are , at first glance , very similar to each other and to published results for bi(110 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dominating features are topologically required closed contours around the @xmath4 , @xmath30 and @xmath13 points as well as a small electron pocket on the @xmath31 line . </S>",
    "<S> this electron pocket does not encircle any trim and is irrelevant for the surface state topology , but in order to facilitate the comparison between the topological predictions and the data , it has been included as a yellow feature in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig:1](d),(e ) . </S>",
    "<S> the topological prediction for bi(110 ) also requires the existence of a closed fermi contour around @xmath28 , but this is not clearly confirmed by the data in this overview scan . in any event , such predictions do not necessarily have to be fulfilled for a semimetal because the topologically required parity changes between surface trims could also be accomplished by the bulk states crossing the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> such projected bulk fermi surface elements are found near the @xmath13 and @xmath28 points on bi(110 ) . </S>",
    "<S> they are indicated by the red areas in fig . [ fig:1](e ) .    the topological quantum phase transition from bi to bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> should be reflected in a change of the surface state dispersion around the @xmath28 point . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the observed change between the fermi surface maps of fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig:1](a ) and ( b ) : while the photoemission intensity at the fermi level near @xmath28 is an elongated stripe in the @xmath32 direction for bi(110 ) , this stripe is split into two features on either side of @xmath28 for bi@xmath10sb@xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this situation near @xmath28 is further explored by a high - resolution scan along @xmath32 for both bi@xmath10sb@xmath11(110 ) and bi(110 ) in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the surface state dispersion in this direction is quite different in the two cases : both surfaces share the hole pocket around @xmath4 but whereas the band forming this pocket disappears into the projected band states for bi@xmath10sb@xmath11(110 ) , its dispersion reaches a binding energy maximum for bi(110 ) before it disperses back towards the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> it only merges with the bulk bands in the immediate vicinity of the @xmath28 point . for bi@xmath10sb@xmath11(110 ) , on the other hand , there is no state observable at @xmath28 but a shallow electron pocket very close to this point .    </S>",
    "<S> these differences in the band structure bring the expected topology change about . for bi(110 ) , one would expect the @xmath28 point to be encircled by an odd number of fermi contours . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , the situation is somewhat unclear because it can not be determined if the surface state band barely crosses the fermi level on both sides of @xmath28 , forming a small hole pocket around the point , or if it stays occupied . in any case , this is not important because one would not necessarily expect the topological predictions to be strictly fulfilled to for a semimetal surface . </S>",
    "<S> any required change of parity could be brought about by the bulk band continuum near @xmath28 . for bi@xmath10sb@xmath11(110 ) , on the other hand , the topological predictions should be strictly followed . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the situation for bi(110 ) , @xmath28 should not be encircled by a closed fermi contour and it clearly is not : the shallow electron pocket marked by a yellow line is close to the @xmath28 point but it does not encircle it . indeed , the electron pockets on either side of @xmath28 can clearly be seen in the fermi surface scan of fig .
