    "the majority of cells infected with the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv-1 ) are activated cd@xmath0 t - cells . once infected , these cells produce additional copies of virus , thereby prolonging the infection . upon detecting such an infection ,",
    "the immune system mounts a complex adaptive response , controlling the virus population to a limited extent .",
    "further control is available in the form of antiretroviral drugs , such as reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( rtis ) and protease inhibitors ( pis ) @xcite .",
    "if such drugs are taken with sufficient frequency , the virus population is largely limited and remains below the level of detection @xcite .",
    "however , antiretroviral therapy ( art ) can not fully eradicate the virus , as viral rebound occurs once therapy is interrupted @xcite a number of factors have been proposed to explain this viral rebound .",
    "most notably , it has been suggested that hiv lay dormant within a number of reservoirs .",
    "primary among these reservoirs are latently infected cd4 + t - cells @xcite .",
    "though latently infected t - cells exist in the body with a much lower frequency than susceptible cd4 + t - cells , the reservoir appears to decay very slowly , with a half - life measured between @xmath2 and @xmath3 months @xcite .",
    "although infected , these cells do not produce new virions until activated , thus potentially providing a longer - lived hiding place where the virus may evade control by either the immune system or antiretroviral treatment @xcite .",
    "consequently , in this paper , we analyze a mathematical model that includes latent infection and examine the control of infection by art .",
    "we also assume that such latent t - cells exist significantly longer than productively infected cd4 + t - cells .",
    "ultimately , we will show that a mathematical analysis of the most basic latent model demonstrates that the inclusion of such cells increases the likelihood for viral clearance under the traditional approach of analyzing the basic reproduction number and the associated stability of equilibria .",
    "while this will seem intuitive from a modeling perspective , as described later , it also appears contradictory to the widely - held notion that latently infected t - cells are an important mechanism for the inability of art to eradicate an established infection .",
    "what this really implies is that standard mathematical tools are insufficient to realistically describe the dynamics of hiv when latent cells are considered .",
    "instead , one must focus on the rate of decay of the infection , which is significantly slowed by the latent t - cell population .",
    "a number of authors have studied the biological aspects of mathematical models concerning hiv dynamics that consider latently infected cells .",
    "notably , callaway and perelson @xcite studied low - level viremia , rong and perelson @xcite modeled viral blips and showed that a latent reservoir could produce viral transients when activated by infection , while sedaghat et al .",
    "@xcite employed a simple model for the dynamics of the latent reservoir to show that its stability was unlikely to stem from ongoing replication during art . in each of these studies , a reduced or linearized mathematical analysis was performed , but the nonlinear behavior of the associated model was not fully elucidated . in the current study , we describe latently infected cells using a separate compartment , as did these authors , by assuming that a proportion of newly - infected cells become latently infected upon contact with the virus , but that they are not productively infected until they leave the latent state , which occurs at a rate @xmath4 proportionate to the strength of the latent cell population .",
    "we note that the effects of viral mutation , which may continuously change model and parameter values , and the possible spatial dependence of parameters are ignored . using this model , we study the influence of the latent reservoir on the persistence of hiv infection and viral rebound .",
    "our results provide a new perspective on the methods of mathematical and stability analysis for viral and latent reservoir persistence .    the paper proceeds as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will review some known results concerning the standard three - component model of hiv dynamics . in section @xmath5",
    ", we introduce an additional population representing latently infected cd@xmath0 t - cells , and study the effects that these cells have on the structure and behavior of the long - time dynamics of the model . in section @xmath6 , we discuss the ramifications of our results and , in particular , the need to construct more precise notions of viral eradication and persistence .",
    "the fifth section contains proofs of the theorems contained within previous sections . in the final section ,",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our results .",
    "in general , the modeling of hiv dynamics _ in vivo _ is complicated by the appearance of spatial inhomogeneities , which can arise from various reservoirs , such as those occurring within lymphatic tissues @xcite .",
    "even when such inhomogeneities are ignored , however , these systems are often described to a sufficient degree by systems of ordinary differential equations that include no spatial dependence .",
    "we begin by considering a three - component model for the evolution of within - host hiv , that does not include spatial fluctuations or effects due to long - lived infected or latently infected cells .",
    "this model has been widely - accepted as a descriptive representation for the basic dynamics of hiv @xcite .",
    "it represents the populations of three components in a fixed volume at a given time @xmath7 : @xmath8 , the number of cd@xmath0 t - cells that are susceptible to hiv-1 infection , @xmath9 the number of infected t - cells that are actively producing virus particles , and @xmath10 the number of free virions .",
    "these quantities approximately satisfy the system of ordinary differential equations @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the recruitment rate of susceptible t - cells and @xmath13 is their mortality rate .",
    "the constant @xmath14 represents the rate of infection , which is included within a bilinear mass action term , while @xmath15 is the death rate of productively infected cells and @xmath16 is the clearance rate of free virus .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is the burst size , i.e. the total number of virions produced by an infected cell during its life span .",
    "the behavior of solutions to these equations has previously been analyzed in great detail @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is known that exactly two steady states exist , which we will write in the form @xmath18 , namely a non - infective equilibrium @xmath19 and an infective or endemic equilibrium @xmath20 where @xmath21 the stability properties of these steady states are also well - known and depend only upon the single parameter @xmath22 , called the basic reproduction number . in particular , one can study the linearized analogue of ( [ 3 cm ] ) and prove the local asymptotic stability of @xmath23 if @xmath24 and the local asymptotic stability of @xmath25 if @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "this result effectively states that for starting values of the populations which are close enough to the given equilibria , the solutions will tend to the respective equilibrium point as @xmath1 .",
    "additionally , the global asymptotic stability of these equilibria is known .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that initial populations are irrelevant in determining the long term dynamics of the solution . more specifically , if @xmath24 , then for any initial population of uninfected cells , infected cells , and virions the solutions of ( [ 3 cm ] ) tend to @xmath23 as @xmath1 .",
    "contrastingly , if @xmath26 the same result holds for the endemic equilibrium @xmath25 .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] displays a representative graph of solutions for which @xmath26 and hence viral infection persists .",
    "though ( [ 3 cm ] ) describes the basic mechanisms which account for the spread of hiv , it lacks the ability to describe the latent stage of a specific subpopulation of infected t - cells .",
    "many studies @xcite have determined that upon infection and transcription of viral rna into cell dna , a fraction of cd@xmath0 t - cells fail to actively produce virus until they are activated , possibly years after their initial infection .",
    "such cells may possess a much longer lifespan than their counterparts , and are termed latently infected . upon activation ,",
    "latently infected cells do become actively productive , and hence begin to increase the viral load through viral replication . a basic model of latent cell activation was initially developed to examine cell populations that contribute to the viral decline that occurs after administration of antiretroviral therapy @xcite .",
    "however , within @xcite and other articles by related authors @xcite , the mathematical analysis of the model is performed under a number of limiting assumptions , including a constant background population of susceptible t - cells and perfect efficacy of anti - retroviral drugs .",
    "thus , we focus on rigorously proving the resulting nonlinear dynamics without these assumptions .    as for ( [ 3 cm ] )",
    "we consider a model describing t - cells that may be susceptible or infected .",
    "in addition , we let @xmath27 represent the new population of latently infected t - cells that can not produce virions at time @xmath7 but begin to do so once they are activated by recall antigens . with this addition , the previously described three - component model now contains four components and is given by @xmath28 here , @xmath29 is the proportion of infections that lead to the production of a latently infected t - cell , rather than a productively infected t - cell , and @xmath4 is the rate at which latently infected cells transition to become actively productive .",
    "additionally , @xmath30 is the rate at which latent cells are cleared from the system .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] displays a representative graph of solutions to ( [ 4 cm ] ) for which @xmath31 .",
    "we note that the oscillations of @xmath32 , and @xmath33 seem quite damped in comparison to those of figure [ fig:1 ] .      in this section and the previous one ,",
    "we have adopted parameter values from other studies .",
    "a few of the parameters possess generally agreed upon values , including @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "however , it should be noted that @xmath12 and @xmath13 are typically estimated for healthy individuals , and thus may not be reliable estimates to describe values within hiv patients , especially for those who experience impaired thymic function @xcite .",
    "obviously , there are many parameters , and these are summarized within table 1 , along with descriptions of the variables , their associated units , and references from which parameter values stem .",
    "the parameter that displays the most uncertainty within the literature is the viral infectivity @xmath14 which fluctuates by an order of magnitude from a value of @xmath34 ml / day @xcite to @xmath35 ml / day @xcite .",
    "the value we utilize here is at the low end of this range and stems from @xcite .",
    "biologically relevant values of the _ in vivo _ burst size @xmath17 are also somewhat uncertain .",
    "estimates based on counting hiv-1 rna molecules in an infected cell vary between hundreds and thousands @xcite , and estimates based on viral production have been as high as @xmath36 @xcite . here , we choose @xmath37 hiv-1 rna / cell as reported in @xcite .",
    "parameters that stem specifically from ( [ 4 cm ] ) are generally not well - known . in particular",
    ", the fraction of new viral infections resulting in latency @xmath4 varies from study to study , but based on previous work @xcite , we use @xmath38 per day . similarly , the removal rate of latently infected cells , @xmath30 , has been discussed as anywhere from @xmath39 per day @xcite to @xmath40 per day @xcite .",
    "hence , we chose a value with this range , namely @xmath41 per day , as reported within @xcite .",
    "the proportion @xmath42 of cells which are categorized as latent upon becoming infected also differs throughout recent studies , ranging from @xmath43 in @xcite to @xmath44 in @xcite . in this case",

    "+    next , we analyze properties of solutions to ( [ 4 cm ] ) so as to compare their dynamics and large time behavior with solutions of ( [ 3 cm ] ) .      as a first step",
    ", we can say with certainty that biologically reasonable values of the parameters give rise to positive populations assuming that at some earlier point ( perhaps at the initial time ) the populations possessed positive values .",
    "[ t1 ] assume all constants in ( [ 4 cm ] ) are nonnegative and the initial values @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are positive .",
    "then , the solutions of ( [ 4 cm ] ) , namely @xmath62 , and @xmath10 exist , are unique , and remain bounded on the interval @xmath63 $ ] for any @xmath64 . additionally , each function remains positive for any @xmath65 .",
    "of course , the requirement of initial positivity is not completely necessary since we may translate or rescale the time variable to alter the initial time .",
    "hence , what is necessary for the theorem to hold is that all populations must attain positive values at _ some _ time .",
    "this result provides some general validation for the model since it implies that negative population values can not occur if one begins with biologically reasonable ( i.e. , positive ) values .",
    "next , we proceed as for ( [ 3 cm ] ) and investigate the possible equilibrium states of ( [ 4 cm ] ) and their stability properties .",
    "we find steady states by solving the nonlinear system of algebraic equations @xmath66 for the unknown constants @xmath67 , and @xmath33 in terms of the parameters @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath16 .",
    "this is a nontrivial task , but eventually we find the existence of exactly two steady states .",
    "we begin by solving for the nonlinear interaction term in the first equation so that @xmath70 with this , we may solve for @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and hence @xmath33 in terms of @xmath51 alone . from the third equation , @xmath73 and",
    "thus @xmath74 next , in the second equation , we find @xmath75 and thus @xmath76 the last equation yields @xmath33 in terms of @xmath72 , whence @xmath51 , so that @xmath77 finally , we may use the representation of @xmath33 in terms of @xmath51 within the first equation and solve a simple quadratic in @xmath51 to determine the possible steady state values . with this , the first equation becomes @xmath78 and it follows that the only solutions are @xmath79 where @xmath80 continuing in this manner , we obtain two corresponding values for @xmath81 , and @xmath33 .",
    "to summarize , we find two equilibria , which we write in the form @xmath82 as @xmath83    as before , we denote the non - infective equilibrium by @xmath23 and the infective equilibrium by @xmath25 .",
    "notice that the limiting values of @xmath32 , and @xmath33 for the infective state are of the same form as those of ( [ 3 cm ] ) , with @xmath84 replacing the role of @xmath22 .",
    "additionally , we see that if @xmath85 , then the equilibria coincide , and if @xmath86 , then the endemic equilibrium corresponds to negative values which , in view of theorem [ t1 ] , can not be obtained from biologically relevant initial data .    by studying the linearized version of the system",
    ", we may examine the local stability of these equilibria and find that their behavior mimics that of ( [ 3 cm ] ) .",
    "[ t2 ] if @xmath87 , then the non - infective equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable . if @xmath88 then the non - infective equilibrium is an unstable saddle point , and the endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable .",
    "therefore , if @xmath87 and population values begin within a sufficiently close distance of @xmath23 , then they will tend to @xmath23 as @xmath1 .",
    "contrastingly , if @xmath88 and initial populations are sufficiently close to @xmath25 , they will tend to @xmath25 in the long run .",
    "theorem [ t2 ] also emphasizes the crucial feature that equilibria are not stable simultaneously , that is , bistability of @xmath23 and @xmath25 does not occur .",
    "furthermore , it expresses that the qualitative behavior of system ( [ 4 cm ] ) changes exactly when @xmath84 transitions from less than one to greater than one , and hence a bifurcation occurs at @xmath85 .",
    "the final theorem of the section demonstrates the stronger result that initial values of these populations have no effect on their long term ( @xmath1 ) limiting values .",
    "[ t3 ] if @xmath89 , then the non - infective equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable . if @xmath88 , then the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable .",
    "this analysis reveals one very important fact about the overall system : the end states of populations are only dependent on the value of @xmath84 , and not any other parameter or initial value .",
    "if @xmath84 is greater than one , then the system tends to @xmath90 , an end state with a non - zero population of infected cells and virions , but if @xmath84 is less than one , then the final equilibrium is @xmath23 , which contains neither virions nor infected t - cells .",
    "the most important feature of these results is the explicit formula for @xmath84 , which can be related exactly to the basic reproductive number of the three - component model ( [ 3 cm ] ) . in order to investigate the differences between the two reproductive ratios ,",
    "we define the quantity @xmath91 notice that @xmath92 depends only upon the three new parameters included within ( [ 4 cm ] ) , namely the activation ratio @xmath4 , proportion of cells which become latent upon infection @xmath42 , and the death rate of latent cells @xmath30 . additionally , if the proportion @xmath42 of infections which produce latently infected t - cells is identically zero , then @xmath93",
    ". however , since we consider @xmath29 we find @xmath94 and the relationship @xmath95 follows directly .",
    "thus , the reproduction number of the latent cell model ( [ 4 cm ] ) is _ strictly less _ than that of the standard three - component model ( [ 3 cm ] ) .",
    "therefore , the stability of the the non - infective state is enhanced by the inclusion of the latently - infected cell population . namely , there are more values of @xmath96 and @xmath17 which correspond to @xmath87 than @xmath24 . from a modeling standpoint , this result is somewhat intuitive . because ( [ 4 cm ] ) assumes that a fraction of newly infected cells become latently infected and the latter can only activate ( becoming actively productive ) or die , the average number of infected cells generated by the introduction of a single infected cell into a susceptible system is decreased in comparison to a model without latently infected cells , namely ( [ 3 cm ] ) .",
    "hence , one should expect that the basic reproduction number , representing this average number of infected cells , does in fact decrease .",
    "another consequence of this results is that there exist a number of parameter values for which @xmath26 but @xmath87 , and in such cases the solutions of ( [ 3 cm ] ) tend to @xmath23 while those of ( [ 4 cm ] ) tend to @xmath25 as @xmath1 . clearly , the converse ( @xmath24 but @xmath88 ) is not possible by the above inequality .",
    "in fact , we may rewrite their ratio @xmath92 as @xmath97 so that the difference between @xmath22 and @xmath84 is greatest for large values of @xmath42 and @xmath30 , but small values of @xmath4 . with the representative parameter values given in table [ tab:1 ]",
    ", we see that @xmath98 hence , the change in system behavior caused by the difference between the reproduction numbers appears somewhat negligible , as both values are significantly larger than their respective bifurcation points .",
    "additionally , @xmath99 in this case , so that the relative difference between @xmath22 and @xmath84 is merely @xmath100 exactly quantifying this relative change , however , is difficult since many of the parameter values of table [ tab:1 ] , in particular @xmath101 , and @xmath30 , are not well - established , and hence this percentage could be much larger or perhaps even smaller .",
    "for example , if we utilize the smallest value of @xmath102 , stemming from @xcite , and the largest values of @xmath103 @xcite and @xmath104 @xcite , then a simple computation shows that @xmath105 .",
    "hence , the relative difference between reproductive ratios could possibly be as large as @xmath106 , though more conservative estimates of the associated parameters place the value of @xmath107 between @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "regardless of the quantified distinction between the reproductive ratios , it seems somewhat counterintuitive that @xmath110 , especially since so many authors @xcite have detailed the large degree to which latent reservoirs contribute to the increased persistence of hiv infection via viral rebound after treatment with art .",
    "hence , the result of the mathematical analysis , namely that the effects of latent infection _ reduce _ the basic reproductive ratio , seems to contradict this theory . however , as we previously stated , the alterations in the mathematical model explain this effect .",
    "additionally , the reproductive ratio is but one parameter , and so it seems unlikely that this particular metric will completely determine the realistic behavior of the system .",
    "in fact , a more detailed analysis of the behavior of solutions over the timescales of biological relevance , rather than considering only the limiting behavior as @xmath1 , will demonstrate the shortcomings of the basic reproductive ratio .",
    "we illustrate this using the effects of antiretroviral therapy and some associated computational results within the next section .",
    "in order to further contrast these two models and the effects of the latent cell population , we will introduce additional parameters to represent the application of antiretroviral therapy .",
    "the inclusion of art will allow us to determine the range of drug efficacies that distinguish between the limiting dynamics of ( [ 3 cm ] ) and ( [ 4 cm ] ) and further elucidate the differing behaviors of the two models .",
    "two classes of antiretroviral drugs are often used to reduce the viral load and limit the infected t - cell population .",
    "one class is known as reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( rtis ) , which can block the infection of target t - cells by infectious virions .",
    "the other category is protease inhibitors ( pis ) , which prevent hiv-1 protease from cleaving the hiv polyprotein into functional units , thereby causing infected cells to produce immature virus particles that are non - infectious . in this way , rtis serve to reduce the rate of infection of activated cd@xmath0 t - cells , whereas pis decrease the number of new infectious virions that are produced .",
    "both drugs thus diminish the propagation of the virus @xcite . while we expect that latently infected cells may absorb pis and that such cells , when activated , will produce noninfectious virus , we will instead assume that pis have no effect on the proportion of cells that are latently infected .",
    "this is in line with some experimental findings , that suggest that antiretroviral drugs do not effectively block replication of virus from the latent reservoir @xcite .",
    "hence , in our model , susceptible t - cells may be inhibited with either rtis , or pis , or they may become infected .",
    "infected cells may be inhibited with pis , and cells inhibited with one drug may be inhibited with the other . in the presence of these two inhibitors , the model equations ( [ 4 cm ] )",
    "are modified to become : @xmath111 where @xmath112 $ ] are the efficacies of rtis and pis , and @xmath113 represents the population of infectious virions .",
    "we may include the number of non - infectious virions @xmath114 , with the total viral load @xmath115 , but @xmath114 decouples from the remaining equations , and hence plays no role in the evolution of the system .    to compute the steady states and basic reproduction number for ( [ 4cmart ] )",
    ", we may reproduce the analysis of ( [ 4 cm ] ) , but clearly the new terms are introduced only where the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath17 appear .",
    "thus , we need only replace @xmath14 with @xmath116 and @xmath17 with @xmath117 . the new basic reproduction number then becomes @xmath118 where we define the quantity @xmath119 , so that @xmath120 since ( [ 4cmart ] ) is identical to ( [ 4 cm ] ) with the minor change in parameter values described above , theorems [ t2 ] and [ t3 ] hold for ( [ 4cmart ] ) with the corresponding value @xmath121 instead of @xmath84 . writing the corresponding viral steady state for ( [ 4cmart ] ) we find @xmath122 and",
    "we notice that its partial derivative @xmath123 is large , especially when @xmath124 .",
    "thus , @xmath125 is sensitive to small changes in @xmath58 , and this sensitivity increases with the efficacy of the rti .",
    "hence , this model does not realistically describe the persistence of low - level viremia in patients on reverse transcriptase inhibitors , as previously addressed within @xcite .",
    "however , we note that @xmath126 which is constant for all values of @xmath59 , and does not possess the same sensitivity .",
    "thus , to simplify the analysis , we will assume throughout that only pis are used , and hence @xmath127 while @xmath128 .    upon incorporating the use of antiretroviral drugs into ( [ 3 cm ] ) ,",
    "the system becomes @xmath129 with associated basic reproduction number @xmath130 as for ( [ 4cmart ] ) , the stability results for ( [ 3 cm ] ) contained in section @xmath131 hold for ( [ 3cmart ] ) by replacing @xmath22 with @xmath132 . comparing the two values @xmath132 and @xmath121 , we see that their ratio is again @xmath92 given by ( [ q ] ) , so that @xmath133 . as before ,",
    "since @xmath134 we find @xmath135 and even with the incorporation of art , the latent cell population _ decreases _ the basic reproduction number of the system . with the representative parameter values given in table [ tab:1 ]",
    ", we see that the basic reproduction numbers associated with ( [ 4cmart ] ) and ( [ 3cmart ] ) are @xmath136 hence , in order for the non - infective state to be realized in ( [ 3cmart ] ) , we must have @xmath137 , which only differs mildly from the value of @xmath138 that is needed to reach the same non - infective state in ( [ 4cmart ] ) , namely @xmath139 .",
    "thus , the antiretroviral therapy must attain an efficacy only @xmath140 greater in order to achieve the analogous effect . from this analysis",
    ", it would seem that the establishment of a latent reservoir should not strengthen a continued infection since the drug efficacy necessary to drive the system to a non - infective equilibrium is actually less for ( [ 4cmart ] ) than for ( [ 3cmart ] ) .",
    "this result seems to greatly contradict the known issues that scientists have faced regarding the eradication of the viral reservoir .",
    "however , the resolution of these seemingly opposing viewpoints is made quite clear by precise numerical simulations .",
    "as an illustrative example of the difference in long - time dynamics between the two models , we may choose values of @xmath138 which yield @xmath141 and @xmath142 and measure their corresponding behavior .",
    "a representative simulation is presented in figure [ fig:3 ] . to differentiate between the corresponding viral loads",
    ", we will denote the infectious virus population associated with ( [ 3cmart ] ) by @xmath143 and its latent model analogue by @xmath144 as in the figure . in this case",
    ", we choose @xmath145 and find @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "hence , from the known results of section @xmath131 and theorem ( [ t3 ] ) , we may deduce that @xmath148 as @xmath1 , while @xmath149 as @xmath1 .",
    "however , one can distinctly see from figure [ fig:3 ] that the early decay rate of @xmath150 is much greater than that of @xmath151 .",
    "notice that the effects of latent infection do not influence the viral load for the first thirty days of treatment as @xmath143 and @xmath144 follow the same approximate trajectory during this time period",
    ". however , once the latently infected t - cell population grows sufficiently large , the effects are tremendous . throughout the first three years of continuous treatment",
    ", @xmath150 diminishes greatly , past @xmath152 in fact , while @xmath151 remains @xmath153 even up to day @xmath154 .",
    "certainly this seems strange as @xmath155 implies a persistent virus population must develop for ( [ 3cmart ] ) and @xmath86 dictates the eventual elimination of the viral population for the latent model . within the inset figure , it can be seen that the behavior predicted by the basic reproduction numbers does eventually occur , that is , values of @xmath150 rebound and tend to a positive equilibrium , while those of @xmath151 continue their slow , steady decline to eradication .",
    "unfortunately , these events occur nearly fifteen years after the introduction of art and well outside the timescale of biological relevance .",
    "hence , it appears that the values of @xmath132 and @xmath121 alone can not provide sufficient information to account for the realistic biological dynamics of the model due to the change in timescales and decay rates introduced by the latent cell population . a better estimate of the behavior would certainly be given by the rates of decay to eradication , but precise estimates on these quantities are more difficult to obtain analytically .",
    "instead , we examine a slightly different metric of viral persistence or clearance .",
    "the feature of viral clearance that one must capture here is not just the decay of the viral load , but a sufficiently rapid speed of decay so as to be realized within a time period of biological relevance .",
    "hence , we consider a specific value of the virus population to represent clearance , and proceed to study the minimum arrival time of the viral load to that value . in this vein",
    ", we define the functions @xmath156 and @xmath157 we note that either of these functions may become infinite if the population of virions fails to reach the prescribed value for any positive time . for example , @xmath158 , since neither viral load obtains a value as small as @xmath159 for a corresponding reproductive ratio of @xmath131 , while @xmath160 and @xmath161 as represented in figure [ fig:4 ] . unlike the stability of equilibria",
    ", the values of @xmath162 and @xmath163 will depend upon the initial population values that are chosen . within the present study , however",
    ", we will continue to utilize the initial populations of previous sections to serve as a representative example .",
    "we first select the value of @xmath159 copies per ml for our definition of viral eradication and study the associated times to eradication provided by the functions @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "namely , what we are assuming is that once the viral population is suitably dilute - in this case less that @xmath159 copies per ml - then the infection has been cleared and no rebound can occur .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] provides a comparison of @xmath164 and @xmath165 for differing values of @xmath132 and @xmath121 , respectively .",
    "though their general shapes are quite similar , the associated time periods differ dramatically .",
    "typical values of @xmath164 range from @xmath166 to @xmath167 days , while the majority of values of @xmath165 range between @xmath154 and @xmath168 days .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig:4 ] , even if the efficacy of the rt inhibitor , @xmath138 , approaches @xmath169 , and thus @xmath132 approaches zero , @xmath150 requires around @xmath170 days to reach a value of @xmath159 . in this same situation , @xmath121 approaches zero , but @xmath151 requires nearly @xmath171 to @xmath154 days to reach a value of @xmath159 .",
    "thus , even for values of @xmath121 which are significantly less than one , we see that it would require nearly three years for the viral load to reach this threshold due to the influence of latent infection . in addition",
    ", we see that @xmath150 will reach values of @xmath159 even if @xmath155 , and this will occur within @xmath167 days , almost ten times faster than it would take @xmath151 to reach the same value for a constant drug efficacy around @xmath172 .    considering that the biological detection threshold is around @xmath173 viral copies per ml @xcite ,",
    "one possibility is that the @xmath159 threshold above has been chosen too small in figure [ fig:4 ] to effectively serve as a realistic measure of eradication .",
    "hence , we consider @xmath174 and @xmath175 and perform a similar analysis .",
    "figure [ fig:5 ] contains these simulations and displays a decrease in the time necessary to reach the defined threshold of @xmath176 .",
    "however , even for a @xmath177 constant drug efficacy , in which case @xmath178 , we see that approximately one year of continuous art would still be required to reach a viral load of @xmath44 copies per ml for ( [ 4cmart ] ) .",
    "additionally , values of @xmath174 remain around @xmath179 for ( [ 3cmart ] ) even if @xmath132 is near @xmath180 , which exceeds the bifurcation point by nearly @xmath181 .",
    "thus , if we define viral clearance as a decay in the viral load to @xmath44 copies per ml within six months of treatment , then ( [ 3cmart ] ) would require @xmath132 to be less than @xmath180 while ( [ 4cmart ] ) would require @xmath121 to be less than @xmath182 .",
    "obviously , a much wider range of parameter values will yield @xmath183 than @xmath184 , and we see that the latent t - cell population does , in fact , extend the period of time during which viremia persists , even though the behavior as @xmath1 , as given by theorems [ t2 ] and [ t3 ] , may provide seemingly contrary information .    from this",
    ", the biological influence of latent infection becomes clear - the time needed to decrease the viral load to values from which rebound is unlikely or unable to occur is increased by a factor of ten or twenty .",
    "hence , the value of the basic reproduction number alone does not represent a proper definition for viral persistence or eradication , and the functions provided above @xmath162 and @xmath163 , for well - chosen values of @xmath185 , possess the information required to better determine the behavior of the infection .",
    "further analysis can be performed for smaller ( and negative ) values of @xmath185 , but the results discussed above are typical . in the next section ,",
    "we prove theorems [ t1 ] , [ t2 ] , and [ t3 ] regarding the qualitative behavior of the latent infection model .",
    "with the analysis concluded , we finally prove the main results of the previous sections . in",
    "what follows , @xmath186 will be used to denote a positive , but arbitrary constant which may change from line to line .",
    "first , we prove the existence , uniqueness , and positivity of solutions .",
    "while one may prove that a certain positive set remains invariant under the flow ( as in @xcite ) , this requires assumptions which bound the initial data from above . in our proof , we utilize a continuity argument instead and do not assume any upper bounds on initial data .",
    "using the picard - lindeloff theorem and the quadratic nature of the equation , the local - in - time existence of a unique , @xmath187 solution follows immediately .",
    "hence , we will concentrate on proving positivity of solutions as long as they remain continuous , and this property will yield bounds on the growth of solutions . from the bounds obtained below , then , it follows that the solution exists globally and is both unique and continuously differentiable for all @xmath188 .",
