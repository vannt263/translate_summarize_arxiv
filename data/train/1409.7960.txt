    "the purpose of this manuscript is to prove a generalized central limit theorem for @xmath1-stable random variables in the setting of sublinear expectation .",
    "such a result complements the limit theorems for @xmath2-normal random variables due to peng and others in this context and answers in the affirmative a question posed by neufeld and nutz in @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "when working with a sublinear expectation , one is simultaneously considering a potentially uncountably infinite and non - dominated collection of probability measures .",
    "a construction of this kind is motivated by the study of pricing under volatility uncertainty .",
    "needless to say , a variety of frequently called upon devices from the classical setting are unavailable .",
    "the complications encompass further issues as well : new behaviors are occasionally observed like those outlined in @xcite .",
    "analogues of significant theorems from classical probability and stochastic analysis are nevertheless moderately abundant .",
    "for instance , versions of the law of large numbers can be found in @xcite and @xcite ; the martingale representation theorem is given in @xcite and @xcite ; girsanov s theorem is obtained in @xcite and @xcite ; and a donsker - type result is shown in @xcite . to conduct investigations along these lines , standard proofs must often be re - imagined .",
    "for instance , peng s proof of the central limit theorem under sublinear expectation in @xcite resorts to interior regularity estimates for fully nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations ( pdes ) .",
    "his idea has since been extended to prove a number of variants of his original result , for example , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we will operate in the sublinear expectation framework unless explicitly indicated otherwise .",
    "the objects of our special attention here , the @xmath1-stable random variables for @xmath3 , were introduced in @xcite .",
    "the authors pondered whether or not these could be the subject of a generalized central limit theorem .",
    "classical generalized central limit theorems ordinarily come in one of three flavors :    a.   a statement indicating that a random variable has a non - empty domain of attraction if and only if it is @xmath1-stable such as theorem  2.1.1 in @xcite , b.   a characterization theorem for the domain of attraction of an @xmath1-stable random variable such as theorem  2.6.1 in @xcite , or c.   a characterization theorem for the domain of normal attraction for an @xmath1-stable random variable such as theorem  2.6.7 in @xcite .",
    "recall that an i.i.d .",
    "sequence @xmath4 of random variables is in the _ domain of attraction _ of a random variable @xmath5 if there exist sequences of constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 so that @xmath8 converges in distribution to @xmath5 as @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath4 is in the _ domain of normal attraction _ of @xmath5 if @xmath10 for some @xmath11 .",
    "we confine our search to the direction suggested by ( iii ) because of the particular importance classically of results of this type ( cf .",
    "the central limit theorem ) .",
    "our main findings are summarized in theorem  [ newmr ] , which details sufficient conditions for membership in the domain of normal attraction of a given @xmath1-stable random variable .",
    "while the initial appearance of our distributional hypotheses is perhaps forbidding , in point of fact , our assumptions are manageable .",
    "this is illustrated by the discussion immediately following theorem  [ newmr ] , as well as examples  [ x1examp ] and  [ bignlexmp ] .",
    "example  [ x1examp ] establishes that the @xmath1-stable random variables under consideration are in their own domain of normal attraction .",
    "although one need not apply theorem  [ newmr ] for this purpose , the write - up serves a clarifying role and any credible result clearly must pass this litmus test .",
    "example  [ bignlexmp ] is more substantive . setting aside a few mild `` uniformity '' conditions which arise due to the supremum",
    ", this example can be understood in an intuitive manner ( see section  [ sectexmp ] ) .",
    "this falls out of our analysis just below theorem  [ newmr ] , where we describe the relationship between our work and the classical result noted in ( iii ) above .",
    "more specifically , theorem  [ newmr ] detects all classical random variables in this collection with mean zero and a cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) that satisfies a small differentiability requirement . an extra regularity condition on",
    "the cdf is unavoidable , as one must translate its form into properties that can be stated only in terms of expectation .",
    "the strategy of our proof is to reduce demonstrating convergence in distribution to showing that a certain limit involving the solution to the backward version of our generating pide is zero .",
    "upon breaking up our domain and summing the corresponding increments of the solution , regularity properties of this function are employed to argue that size of the terms being added together decay rapidly enough in the limit to furnish the desired conclusion .",
    "this general scheme is similar to that initiated in @xcite , except that the generating equation there is @xmath12 for some @xmath13 and appropriate function @xmath14 .",
    "recall that this equation is known as the barenblatt equation if @xmath15 and has been studied in @xcite and @xcite , for instance .",
    "ours is given by ( [ upideback ] ) , a difference that leads to a few difficulties as reflected by the increased complexity of our hypotheses .",
    "to overcome these difficulties , we use the technology from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the work in this paper offers a step toward understanding @xmath16-stability under sublinear expectation .",
    "the simple interpretation admitted by example  [ bignlexmp ] is promising , as developing intuition in this environment is usually a tough undertaking for the reasons mentioned previously .",
    "a brief overview of necessary background material can be found in section  [ sectback ] .",
    "we prove our main result and discuss its connection to the classical case in section  [ mrsection ] .",
    "examples highlighting the applications of our main result are contained in section  [ sectexmp ] .",
    "we give some prerequisite material for the proof of the essential interior regularity estimate for our pide in appendix  [ pidebackgroundapp ] .",
    "the proof of this estimate is in appendix  [ pideappend ] .",
    "we now offer a concise account of those aspects of sublinear expectations , @xmath1-stable random variables , and pides which are required for the sequel .. ] references for more comprehensive treatments of these topics are also included for the convenience of the interested reader .",
