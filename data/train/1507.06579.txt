    "followup observations of sn 2012aw were presented by @xcite and @xcite ; the sn appears relatively bright and quite similar to sn 1999em , with an ejected @xmath3ni mass of 0.06  m@xmath2 .",

    "the candidate had an apparent magnitude in _",

    "however , @xcite pointed out that both of these mass ranges were likely overestimates due to an incorrect treatment of the effects of circumstellar dust .",
    "@xcite argued that a purely silicate dust composition would be more appropriate for a red supergiant , and that dust emission in the nir must be considered .",
    "moreover , they point out that scattered photons from a shell of dust around a star will also contribute to its observed flux ; resulting in a tendency to over - estimate the effects of extinction on luminosity when using a @xcite extinction law .    in this letter",

    "the combined first pass image was then used to identify point and extended sources , and create a mask for these .",

    "the bad pixel mask , flat field and illumination correction were then applied to all science frames . a sky frame for each filter was created from the mean of the science frames , using sigma clipping to remove sources . as the images are relatively shallow , it was not found to be necessary to use a two pass sky subtraction .",
    "finally , the images taken in each filter were shifted to a common pixel grid and co - added .",

    "the pixel coordinates of point sources common to both frames were measured , and iraf geomap was then used to derive a geometric transformation between the matched coordinate lists .",
    "this transformation was then applied to the late - time image to map it onto the same pixel grid as the pre - explosion frame . by transforming the late - time rather than the pre - explosion image , we avoid reducing the signal - to - noise of the progenitor candidate .",
    "we used the high order transform of psf and template subtraction ( hotpants ) package to match the point spread functions ( psfs ) of the two aligned frames and perform difference imaging between them .",
    "the resulting subtracted images are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] . in both filters ,",
    "the source visible in pre - explosion imaging has disappeared at late times , and appears as a source in the difference images , confirming the identification of the progenitor candidate . in the _ j_-band",
    "there is a residual corresponding to a poorly subtracted nearby bright star , and there is some structure to the background in the subtracted image which is caused by proximity to the edge of the image , while in _ k_-band the subtraction appears good , with only a single source ( most likely a variable foreground star ) in the difference image apart from the progenitor .",
    "we used eight bright two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) sources within the footprint of the entire hawk - i mosaic to determine the photometric zeropoint for the hawk - i _ ks_-band image , with an uncertainty in zeropoint of 0.11 mag .",
    "these were in turn used to define a local tertiary photometric sequence of intermediate - magnitude sources which were visible in the pre - explosion sofi _",
    "ks _ image .",
    "the same procedure was used to determine the zeropoint of the _ j_-band image , with an uncertainty of 0.15  mag .",
    "we performed psf - fitting photometry on the progenitor in template subtracted images in _ ks _ and on the un - subtracted image in _",
    "j _ using the snoopy package , and calibrated the resulting magnitudes using the local sequence .",
    "the magnitude of the progenitor was found to be _",
    "j_=@xmath14 , and _ ks_=@xmath15  mag , where the error reflects both the uncertainty in zeropoint , and progenitor photometry as determined by artificial star tests .",
    "these magnitudes are consistent with the values found by both and . as an additional test",
    ", we also performed aperture photometry on the progenitor in the _ k_-band image ( where the nearby source to the south east is not visible in the pre - explosion frame ) and find a magnitude which is consistent to within the uncertainties with the results from psf - fitting photometry .    in principle",
    ", one could improve the photometry for the _ j_-band pre - explosion data by measuring the magnitude of the progenitor on the template subtracted image , which may reduce the contribution of the nearby source to the south west to the measured flux .",
    "however , as we were unable to obtain a satisfactory subtraction for the _ j_-band image due to the proximity of sn 2012aw to the edge of the detector in the pre - explosion image , measuring its magnitude on the difference image did not improve our results .",
    "as no late - time images were taken in the _ h_-band , we were unable to perform template subtraction , or to improve the photometric calibration of the pre - explosion data using observations of standard fields .",
    "we performed psf - fitting photometry on the sofi _",
    "h _ image ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : h ] ) using snoopy , and estimated the photometric error through artificial star tests at the location of the progenitor .",
    "the zeropoint of the image was determined through aperture photometry of six sources in the field for which 2mass photometry were available .",
    "while 2mass has a large photometric uncertainty for faint sources , the uncertainty in zeropoint is insignificant compared to the photometric error for the progenitor .",
    "we determine the magnitude of the progenitor to be _ h",
    "_  =  @xmath0 .    5 , with the progenitor circled .",
    "our photometry is consistent with that measured by and , and so the progenitor luminosity calculated by @xcite remains valid .",
    "we adopt the 1@xmath16 range for the progenitor luminosity assuming silicate dust from @xcite , who constrain the progenitor to have a luminosity of log l / l@xmath2=4.85.0  dex . using the solar metallicity stars models @xcite",
    "as presented in @xcite , this luminosity corresponds to a progenitor zero - age main sequence ( zams ) mass of between 11 and 14  m@xmath2 .",
    "we hence adopt 12.5@xmath11.5 m@xmath2  for the mass of the progenitor of sn 2012aw .",
    "we note that other modern stellar evolutionary codes will give similar results , as the final model luminosities for a given mass are comparable to those from the stars code@xcite .",
    "@xcite presented late - time ultraviolet and optical imaging from _ hst _ taken on 2014 april 23 , in which a resolved light echo was observed for sn 2012aw , caused by diffuse interstellar dust scattering the sn flux .",
    "the sn itself was still visible in these observations as a point source , although @xcite found that its magnitude in _",
    "f814w _ was 0.4  mag fainter than that of the progenitor , and suggested that the latter had vanished .",
    "the light echo is more pronounced in the bluer bands , and hence will not affect our nir observations ( which were also taken @xmath41  yr after the _ hst _ data ) .",
    "the disappearance of the progenitor of sn 2012aw brings the sample of type iip sne for which a red supergiant progenitor candidate has been confirmed through late - time imaging to seven .",
    "sn 2012aw is among the highest mass progenitors seen to disappear thus far , and despite some erroneous early claims that it may lie above the observed 16.5  m@xmath2  limit for type iip sn progenitors , it now appears to be securely below this limit .",
    "in fact , even if we compare the 1@xmath16 upper limit on the luminosity of sn 2012aw ( log  l / l@xmath2=5.0  dex ) , to the model luminosity at the end of core he - burning ( which is a conservative _ lower _ limit on the luminosity at the point of core - collapse ) , then the progenitor must be @xmath1717  m@xmath2 .",
    "two independent techniques have been applied to estimate the zams mass of the progenitor of sn 2012aw .",
    "@xcite used nlte radiative transfer models to derive a progenitor mass from the observed strength of emission lines in the late - time nebular spectra of the sn .",
    "based on this , @xcite ruled out a progenitor zams mass @xmath1820  m@xmath2 and found that a @xmath415 m@xmath2  model consistently reproduced the observations .",
    "however , the 12  m@xmath2  model of @xcite also provides a reasonable match to the line strengths , in particular for the sensitive [ o  i ]  @xmath19  6300,6364    lines .",
    "@xcite used a radiation - hydrodynamics code to model the early luminosity , temperature and velocity evolution of sn 2012aw , and found a best fitting progenitor model had a 19.6  m@xmath2  envelope mass .",
    "this is clearly inconsistent with the progenitor mass from direct imaging , and moreover continues the tendency for hydrodynamic models to yield higher progenitor masses when compared to direct detections @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite performed an initial exploration of the potential progenitor parameter space using a semi - analytic code , and that the @xmath20 distribution of their models as a function of mass appears to show a local minimum at @xmath416m@xmath2",
    ". however , the full radiation - hydrodynamics code was unable to simultaneously fit the plateau duration and velocities for a model with this mass .",
