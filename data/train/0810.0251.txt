    "neutron beta decay provides one of the most sensitive means for exploring details and limits of our understanding of the weak interaction .",
    "thanks to its highly precise theoretical description @xcite , neutron decay is sensitive to contributions from processes not included in the standard model ( sm ) of particles and interactions ( for comprehensive reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . neglecting recoil , radiative and loop corrections ,",
    "the differential decay rate for unpolarized neutrons is given by parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the electron momentum , energy , and e@xmath10 opening angle , respectively @xcite .",
    "the e@xmath11 correlation parameter @xmath0 , and the asymmetry parameters with respect to the neutron spin : @xmath12 ( beta ) , @xmath13 ( neutrino ) , and @xmath14 ( proton ; @xmath15 in leading order ) possess complementary dependencies on the ratio of fermi constants @xmath16 , as well as on operators that depart from the @xmath17 form of the sm charged current ( cc ) weak interaction .",
    "additionally , @xmath1 , the fierz interference term , offers an independent test of scalar and tensor admixtures arising in broad classes of l - r mixing susy extensions .",
    "thus precise measurements of neutron decay parameters offer the distinct advantage of overconstrained independent checks of the sm predictions , as well as the potential for indicating or ruling out certain types of extensions to the sm @xmath17 form @xcite .",
    "hence , a set of appropriately precise measurements of the neutron decay parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 will have considerably greater physics implications than the erstwhile predominant experimental focus on @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath18 . at a minimum ,",
    "such a data set combined with new measurements of the neutron lifetime , @xmath19 , will enable a definitive resolution of the persistent discrepancies in @xmath18 and cabibbo  kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the nab collaboration @xcite has undertaken to carry out precise measurements of @xmath0 , the e@xmath11 correlation parameter , and @xmath1 , the so far unmeasured fierz interference term , in neutron decay .",
    "goal accuracies are @xmath21 and @xmath22 . a novel @xmath23 field - expansion spectrometer based on ideas outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite will be used in the fundamental neutron physics beamline ( fnpb ) at the spallation neutron source ( sns ) at oak ridge , tennessee .",
    "the nab experiment constitutes the first phase of a program of measurements that will continue with second - generation measurements of spin correlations in neutron decay .",
    "the next experiment , named ` abba ' , will measure parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 in addition to @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , the proton asymmetry @xmath14 will be measured with the same apparatus .",
    "together , nab and abba form a complete program of measurements of the main neutron decay parameters in a single apparatus with shared systematics and consistency checks .",
    "the experiments are complementary : nab is highly optimized for the measurement of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , while abba focuses on @xmath12 and @xmath13 with a lower - precision consistency check of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters .",
    "nab joins two existing experiments , aspect @xcite and acorn @xcite , which also study @xmath0 .",
    "the correlation parameter of interest , @xmath0 , measures the dependence of the neutron beta decay rate on the cosine of the e@xmath10 relative angle .",
    "the nab method of determination of @xmath0 relies on the linear dependence of @xmath24 on @xmath25 , the square of the proton momentum for a given electron momentum ( or energy ) .",
    "conservation of momentum gives the relation @xmath26    to    to    where , to a very good approximation , @xmath27 depends only on @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 ) .",
    "thus , eq .  [ eq : psq_cos_enu ] reduces to a linear relation between @xmath30 and @xmath25 for a fixed @xmath29 .",
    "the mapping of @xmath30 and @xmath25 is shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : proton_ps ] . in this plot , the phase space alone distributes proton events evenly in @xmath25 between the lower and upper bounds for any fixed value of @xmath31 .",
    "given the linear relationship between @xmath25 and @xmath30 , the slope of the @xmath25 probability distribution is determined by the correlation parameter @xmath0 ; in fact it is given by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : resp_slope ] ) .",
    "this observation leads to the main principle of measurement of @xmath0 which involves measurement of the proton momenta via the proton time of flight ( tof ) , @xmath34 , in a suitably constructed magnetic spectrometer .",
    "ideally , the magnetic field longitudinalizes the proton momentum and @xmath35 ; @xmath34 is measured as the difference between the arrival times of the electron and the proton at the detector(s ) . in the present discussion",
    "we neglect the electron tof .",
    "parameter @xmath0 is determined from the slopes of the @xmath36 distributions for different values of @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath0 were null , all distributions would have a slope of zero .",
    "having multiple independent measurements of @xmath0 for different electron energies provides a powerful check of systematics , as discussed below . the fierz interference term @xmath1 is determined from the shape of the measured electron energy spectrum .    for fixed @xmath8 , a perfect spectrometer would record a trapezoidal distribution of @xmath36 with sharp edges .",
    "the precise location of these edges is determined by well - defined kinematic cutoffs that only depend on @xmath8 . however",
    ", a realistic time - of - flight spectrometer will produce imperfect measurements of the proton momenta due to the spectrometer response function , discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : uncerts ] .",
    "the measured locations and shapes of edges in @xmath36 distributions will allow us to examine the spectrometer response function and verify that the fields have been measured correctly .",
    "the main requirements on the spectrometer are :    1 .",
    "the spectrometer and its magnetic ( @xmath38 ) and electric ( @xmath39 ) fields are designed to be azimuthally symmetric about the central axis , @xmath40 .",
    "2 .   neutrons must decay in a region of large @xmath38 .",
    "the resulting protons and electrons spiral around a magnetic field line .",
    "an electric field is required to accelerate the proton from the ev - range energies to a detectable energy range prior to reaching the detector .",
    "this field imposes , however , an energy threshold on e@xmath41 detection .",
    "4 .   the proton momentum must rapidly become parallel to the magnetic field direction to ensure that the proton time of flight @xmath42 .",
    "this requirement dictates a sharp field curvature ( @xmath43 ) at the origin , followed by a sharp falloff of @xmath44 .",
    "the basic concept of the spectrometer consists of collinear solenoids with their longitudinal axis oriented normal to the neutron beam , which passes through the solenoid center .",
    "the solenoidal magnetic field starts out high at the position of the neutron beam , typically 4 t , dropping off quickly to parallelize the momenta as protons enter the long `` drift '' region . in the detection region at either end of the solenoid the field is increased to 1/4 of its central peak value .",
    "cylindrical electrodes ( consisting of three sections ) maintain the neutron decay region at a potential of + 30kv with respect to the ends of the solenoid where detectors are placed at ground potential .",
    "the magnetic field strength is sufficiently high to constrain both electrons and protons from neutron decay to spiral along the magnetic field lines with the component of the spiral motion transverse to the field limited by cyclotron radii of the order of a few millimeters .    ) and magnetic field ( @xmath13 ) profiles on axis for 1/2 of the nab spectrometer length.,title=\"fig : \" ] ) and magnetic field ( @xmath13 ) profiles on axis for 1/2 of the nab spectrometer length.,title=\"fig : \" ]    hence , two segmented si detectors , one at each end of the solenoid , view both electrons and protons in an effective @xmath23 geometry .",
    "the time of flight between the electron and proton is accurately measured in a long , @xmath45 meter , drift distance .",
    "the electron energy is accurately measured in the si detectors .",
    "the proton momentum and electron energy determine the electron ",
    "neutrino opening angle .",
    "we note that by sorting the data on proton time of flight and electron energy , @xmath0 can be determined with a statistical uncertainty that is only 4% greater than the theoretical minimum @xcite .        , shown for different proton momenta , the magnetic field from fig .",

    "[ fig : det_sketch ] . in the center of the spectrometer",
    "the axial field strength is 4 t , in the drift region 0.1 t , and near the si detectors 1 t ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spect_1 ] ) .    in a realistic spectrometer , however , the perfect one - to - one correspondence of proton momentum and time of flight is lost , due to imperfect momentum longitudinalization and other systematic effects , such as the lateral size of the neutron beam in the decay region . in other words , the detector response function instead of being a delta function in @xmath36 for each value of @xmath25 , becomes a broadened function , such as the ones calculated for three proton momenta and depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : nabspectrometerresponse ] . the key challenge of the nab approach to measuring @xmath0 is to minimize the width of the detector response function while keeping the relevant systematics under control .",

    "[ fig : spect_1 ] and a centered neutron beam with a width of 2 cm . ]    strictly speaking , determining @xmath1 requires detecting only the electron and reliably measuring its kinetic energy .",
    "nevertheless , there are a number of challenges associated with this measurement , commented on in the following section .",
    "the statistical sensitivity of our measurement method is primarily determined by the spectrometer acceptance and imposed energy and tof restrictions .",
    "the statistical uncertainties for our measurements of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters in neutron decay are listed in tab .",

    "thus , parallel analyses will be performed keeping @xmath51 and @xmath52 free , in order to study and remove their systematic effects .",

    "[ tab : stat_unc ]    the calculated fnpb neutron decay rate under sns full - power conditions of @xmath4619.5/(@xmath58s ) , and with the nab fiducial decay volume of 20@xmath58 , yields @xmath46400 detected decays / sec @xcite . in a typical 10-day run of @xmath59s of net beam time",
    "we would achieve @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "since we plan to collect several samples of @xmath62 events in several 6-week runs , the overall nab accuracy will not be statistics - limited .",
    "controlling the measurement systematics presents by far the greatest challenge in the nab experiment .",
    "the most basic task is to specify the spectrometer fields with precision sufficient for an accurate determination of the spectrometer response function @xmath63 .",
    "we have adopted two methods of addressing this problem . in the first approach ( method a )",
    ", we determine the shape of the spectrometer response function from theory , leaving several parameters free , to be determined by fits to the measured spectra . the second approach ( method b )",
    "relies on obtaining the detection function with its uncertainties _ a priori _ from a full description of the neutron beam and electromagnetic field geometry .",
    "subsequently , the experimental data are fitted with only the physics observables as free parameters . below we summarize some of the main challenges along with strategies for their control at the required level . a much more detailed discussion of both methods and the experimental challenges is given in the nab experiment proposal  @xcite .",
    "* _ precise specification of the neutron beam profile : _ a mere 100@xmath64 m shift of the beam center induces @xmath65% .",
    "however , this effect cancels when averaging over the two detectors on opposite sides of the solenoid ; measuring a nonzero up - down proton counting asymmetry pins it down sufficiently .",
    "* _ magnetic field map : _ the field expansion ratio defined as @xmath66 must be controlled at the level of @xmath67 in order to keep @xmath3 under @xmath2 .",
    "this will be mapped out using a calibrated hall probe .",

    "_ adiabaticity _ of the magnetic field configuration is not an absolute requirement .",
    "detailed monte carlo analysis has shown excellent efficiency of proton momentum longitudinalization for certain relatively non - adiabatic fields .",
    "however , an adiabatic design makes the evaluation of systematic errors simpler and more reliable . *",
    "_ doppler effect : _ adverse effects of the doppler effect will apparently be controlled sufficiently by the spectrometer design , but a thorough analysis will be made in conjunction with the final design .",
    "* _ detector alignment : _ the spectrometer imaging properties provide for a self - consistent calibration in the data .",
    "* _ electron energy calibration _ is required at the @xmath73 level .",
    "to achieve it we ll use radioactive sources , evaluate directional count rate asymmetries , and also leave it as a fitting parameter with acceptably small loss of statistical sensitivity ( see tab .",

    "while it is not necessary to reach this timing accuracy for each event , it has to be achieved for the event sample average , a realistic goal given the planned event statistics . *",
    "_ edge effects _ introduce important systematics .",
    "thanks to the imaging properties of the spectrometers , these can be controlled and corrected for to a sufficient degree with appropriate cuts on the data .     + sources of uncertainties in the measurement of @xmath1 are fewer than for @xmath0 since accurate proton momentum measurement ( via its tof ) is not required .",
    "the dominant sources are electron energy calibration ( discussed above ) and electron backgrounds .",
    "* _ neutron beam related backgrounds _ are notoriously hard to calculate and model _ a priori _ , and will ultimately have to be measured and characterized _ in situ_. reasonable estimates place the beam - related background rates below the signal rate . while we have plans for shielding and lining surfaces with neutron absorbing @xmath75lif material , the coincident technique of detecting e ",

    "_ particle trapping : _ electrons can be trapped in the decay volume , expansion , and tof regions .",

    "the potential well trap does not cause a problem for electrons above our energy threshold .",
    "the longitudinalization of the electron momentum due to the magnetic field allows all of them to escape and to reach the detector .",
