    "protein - dna recognition plays an essential role in the regulation of gene expression .",
    "although a significant number of structures of dna binding proteins have been solved in complex with their dna binding sites increasing our understanding of recognition principles , most of the questions remain unanswered .",
    "several studies showed that protein - dna recognition could not be explained by a simple one - to - one correspondence between amino acids and bases @xcite , even if hypothesized hydrogen bonding patterns and definite preferences have been actually found in experimentally solved structures @xcite .",
    "moreover regulatory proteins are known to recognize specific dna sequences directly through atomic contacts between protein and dna and/or indirectly through water - mediated contacts and conformational changes @xcite .",
    "the degree of redundancy and flexibility seems to suggest that the recognition mechanism is ambiguous , therefore the prediction of dna target sequences is not straightforward @xcite .",
    "dna protein interactions can be studied using several different computational methods , which could offer several advantages compared to the current experimental methods , more laborious and slow . in the following",
    "we will indicate , for simplicity , dna - binding protein target sequences with the more specific term `` transcription factor binding sequences '' , although the first term is more general . + computational tools for the identification of transcription factors ( tf ) binding sequences can be organized in two main approaches :    * `` sequence based methods '' in which a central role is played by the statistical properties of the base distribution in the dna regions which are expected to be involved in transcriptional regulation ( see @xcite for a general review on the subject ) .",
    "* `` structure based tools '' which use the structural information on protein - dna complexes derived from x - ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance .",
    "the main focus of this paper is on the second approach , although the best results will likely be obtained by tools able to combine in a clever way these two approaches .",
    "0.3 cm * sequence based methods * + this type of algorithms can in turn be divided into two broad groups :    \\i ) enumerative methods , which explore all possible motifs up to a certain length ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "\\ii ) local search algorithms , including expectation maximization and various flavours of gibbs sampling ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to stress that this type of studies can not be based exclusively on the statistical features of the dna regions presumably involved in transcriptional regulation , but must be complemented with independent information about gene regulation . in this respect",
    "three important sources of information may be used : the functional annotations collected in public databases , gene expression data on a global scale , and the so called phylogenetic footprinting. in particular this last approach , thanks to the increasing number of sequenced genomes , has proved to be very effective in these last few years ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the major problem of all these tools is the large number of false positives , above all in the case of higher eukaryotes ( for a thorough analysis of this problem see the interesting assessment of tf binding sites discovery tools reported in  @xcite ) .",
    "it is exactly to cope with this type of problem that it could be important to resort to structure based approaches .",
    "0.3 cm * structure based methods + *    these methods can be broadly divided into two classes according to a nomenclature adopted in the context of protein structure prediction @xcite : + i ) those based on knowledge based potentials ( mostly statistical effective energy functions , seefs ) ; + ii ) those based on physical potentials ( or physical effective energy functions , peefs ) . +",
    "seefs are energy functions derived from a dataset of known protein - dna structures .",
    "a set of features is selected ( e.g. nucleotide - amino acid contacts , roll angles for dna bases , interatomic distances , etc . ) ; the process often involves parameter choices , like threshold on distances or interval binning .",
    "the statistical properties of these features are compared with a - priori expectations and log - odd scores are derived @xcite . at the most basic level , structures may be used to define contacts among dna bases and protein amino acids and , for each pair of positions , the occurrences of nucleotides and amino acids contacts are used to derive effective potentials @xcite . moreover a statistical potential , taking into account contact geometry and spatial arrangement of contacting residues can be derived @xcite .",
    "recently interesting developments of this approach have been proposed ( @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the approach suffers from theoretical and practical problems . from the theoretical point of view potentials of mean force",
    "are not in general additive and the exact modelization of a - priori expectations ( or so - called reference state ) may be difficult for complex systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the main practical problem is the requirement of a large number of sequences or binding experimental data since the available data may be biased towards specific classes of protein - dna complexes .",
    "moreover datasets generally do not contain unfavourable interactions between amino acids and bases since they entail protein - dna complexes that occur naturally .",
    "thus the statistical potential may predict correctly the wild type targets as opposed to incorrect ones , but it may not be as good at distinguishing among mutants .",
    "+ notwithstanding all caveats usage of seefs are widespread in the field of structural predictions .",
    "provided that sufficient data are available these methods are reasonably fast and accurate , as demonstrated for instance in the field of protein structure prediction ( see e.g @xcite ) .",
    "+ a more radical approach is to estimate the free energy of binding starting directly from the available ( or homology built ) protein - dna complexes using physical effective energy functions ( peefs ) .",
    "this approach has been successfully used in many contexts , ranging from estimation of dna- or protein - ligand binding free energy to estimation of protein - dna binding free energy ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there are , however , many problems connected with the approach which are mainly due to : + i ) difficulties in estimating entropic effects ; + ii ) difficulties in properly estimating solvation effects ; + no consensus has emerged on the choice of parameters ( e.g. inner dielectric constant , surface tension coefficient , forcefield parameters ) and on the protocols that should be applied ; + iii ) difficulties in estimating gas - phase energy with available forcefields which are derived from the analysis of small compounds at equilibrium and do not take into account electrostatic polarization . + in order to get rid as far as possible of all these problems , binding free energies are expressed relative to a reference system and in most computational studies optimal parameters have been chosen for matching experimental data . + as far as protein - dna complexes are concerned attempts to compute binding free energies using physics based approaches have started in the 1990s .",
    "the electrostatic component of the binding free energy has been studied according to continuum methods and its dependence on temperature and salt concentration has been computed @xcite .",
    "integration of electrostatics with other components including dna conformational free energy has been extended from dna - ligand complexes @xcite and protein - peptide complexes @xcite to protein - dna complexes @xcite .",
    "recently wojciechowski et al .",
    "@xcite studied the complex of telomerase end binding protein with single stranded dna optimizing the weights of different contributions in order to reproduce binding data .",
    "the availability of the successful analytical generalized born model treatment of electrostatics solvation effects enabled computation of binding energies with hybrid molecular mechanics / generalized born surface accessibility methods by jayaram et al . @xcite .",
    "the group of kollman developed the molecular mechanics / poisson boltzmann surface accessibility ( mm / pbsa ) methodology and applied it extensively to biomolecular systems ( see for a review of these applications @xcite and @xcite for important extensions of these ideas ) .",
    "+ however , when mm / gbsa or mm / pbsa energy versus time plots are presented for explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulation snapshots , fluctuations in the range of tens to hundreds of kcal / mol are found , thus posing an issue on the reliability of averages . in this respect",
    "seefs appear much more robust energy estimation methods .",
    "+ in a few very recent reports interesting results have been reported concerning the capability of hybrid methods to predict protein - dna binding sites @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the application of peefs to a single dna binding protein in complex with many different dna sequences .",
    "+ the availability of high resolution x - ray crystal structure @xcite and suitable experimental data makes the @xmath0 repressor - operator complex an interesting system for computational analysis of protein - dna interaction .",
    "+ the bacteriophage @xmath0 repressor protein is a small , 92 amino acid , protein that binds the dna as a dimer .",
    "each monomer binds to an operator half site .",
    "the amino - terminal domain of @xmath0 repressor is responsible for dna binding and the carboxy - terminal domain is primarily responsible for dimerization @xcite .",
    "each monomer contains a typical helix - turn - helix motif found in a variety of dna binding proteins @xcite .",
    "the free energy of binding of @xmath0 repressor for wild - type @xmath1 operator dna and of all possible single base - pair substitutions within the operator have been experimentally measured using the filter binding assay technique and changes in the free energy of binding caused by the mutations have been determined @xcite .",
    "+ besides being a perfect playground to test our methods , the so called `` @xmath0-switch '' in which the @xmath0 repressor is involved is very interesting in itself ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "this `` genetic '' switch is tightly regulated by the @xmath0 repressor and the @xmath2 proteins . in these last years",
    "this system , due to its relative simplicity and to the availability of rather precise experimental data attracted a lot of interest and various models ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) have been proposed to describe its behaviour . despite these efforts in all these models",
    "there are still a few open problems which need to be understood .",
    "in particular it has been recently realized that in order to ensure the remarkable stability of the @xmath0 switch one should require a very high non - specific affinity both for the @xmath0 repressor and for @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "such a prediction is very difficult to test experimentally but could rather directly be evaluated with the tools which we shall discuss in this paper .",
    "in fact one of the main goal of the test which we shall perform on the @xmath0 repressor will be the evaluation of its non - specific binding energy and the comparison with the prediction of the model discussed in  @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we apply different techniques to evaluate the binding affinities by means of computational methods .",
    "it is assumed that the relative free energy of binding of a protein to different dna sequences may be expressed as the sum of a molecular mechanical term , that includes the non - bonded electrostatic and van der waals contributions , and a hydration term that can be further split in a polar and a hydrophobic contribution . due to the peculiar nature of hydrogen bonds",
    "similar alternative models are tested where an energy term proportional to the number of hydrogen bonds is added .",
    "+ the systems studied here differ only in one or two base - pairs and therefore the inaccuracies implicit in the assumption of rigid docking , of the solvation model , of the treatment of entropy and in lack of a complete conformational search for side chains at protein - dna interface should mostly cancel out in comparison . +",
    "the aims of this paper are : + 1 ) to provide an assessment of the accuracy of different methods and protocols by comparison with experimental data ; + 2 ) to provide a reliable estimate of non - specific binding energies ; + 3 ) to propose a protocol for the prediction of dna - binding target sequences which makes no use of sequence information . + to pursue these objectives we make use of extensive computations and address several specific issues . in particular : + i ) we estimate optimal weights for different contributions to dna - protein binding free energies using different solvation models ; + ii ) for 52 single base - pair mutants we perform 1 ns molecular dynamics ( md ) runs and we assess the effect of md on the computed binding energies ; + iii ) we compute mm / gbsa binding energies for one thousand complexes where the bases of the double stranded dna are substituted according to randomly generated dna sequences in order to estimate non - specific binding free energy ; + iv ) we scan the entire bacteriophage @xmath0 genome with the scoring profiles obtained from free energy computations .",
    "one of the profiles is obtained making use only of the structural data available for a single molecular complex , with no sequence information .",
    "+ the statistical analysis of the results show that computational methods may offer a predictive tool truly complementary to sequence - based identification of dna - binding protein target sequences .",
    "this is particularly important in view of the emergence of consensus protocols where the independence of the different methods is a prerequisite .",
    "binding free energy changes between the @xmath0 repressor dimer and the dna operator mutants have been calculated using different methodologies , as described in the _ methods _ section .",
    "we calculated the binding free energy between the @xmath0 repressor dimer and the dna operators , after having energy - minimized every complex using a distance dependent dielectric constant ( 1r , 2r , 4r , 8r , respectively , in order to match subsequent energy evaluation ) .",
    "the interaction energy between the protein and the dna , @xmath3 , has been evaluated using four values for @xmath4 ( 1r , 2r , 4r , 8r ) then the solvation term @xmath5 has been determined according to the model of oobatake et al",

    "the best scaling factors have been determined ( together with the standard deviation computed according to eq .",

    "the addition of a specific hydrogen bond term reduces the coefficients of the electrostatic term .",
    "the rmsd and the correlation coefficient @xmath6 have been computed and a leave - one - out scheme has been adopted , in order to verify the performance of the model ( table 2 ) . the same analysis has been performed for 5000 replicas of the dataset with one third of the set left out and used for cross - validation .",
    "the average rmsd and correlation are essentially the same reported for the leave - one - out scheme reported in table 2 . from the same analysis variances of the coefficients have been estimated with essentially the same results as those reported in table 1 .",
    "+ the best correlation coefficient ( @xmath6 = 0.703 for mm / dddc - oons(+hb ) model ) has been obtained for @xmath7 , although values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 gave very similar results for both mm / dddc - oons and mm / dddc - oons(+hb ) models . except for the mm / dddc - oons(+hb ) model with @xmath10 , the f - statistic shows that the model is significant ( p @xmath11 0.001 ) .",
    "the dielectric constant @xmath10 , which gives the worst results tends in many cases to overestimate binding free energy changes lower than 1.0 kcal / mol whereas binding free energy changes greater than 2 kcal / mol are underestimated .",
    "a similar behaviour has been observed for @xmath12 , even if these models are able to better reproduce binding free energy changes , in particular improvements have been obtained for values lower than 1.0 kcal / mol ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the correlation coefficients between calculated and experimental values are 0.543 , 0.667 , 0.703 and 0.701 for @xmath13 , respectively . ]",
    "the analysis of the best scaling coefficients is not straightforward because there is a strong correlation between the energy terms .",
    "for instance , for all @xmath4 models the electrostatic term is strongly anticorrelated with the oons solvation term . + moreover the estimated variance of coefficients is often very large . notwithstanding these difficulties",
    "it is worth noting that some terms appear to be particularly important .",
    "for instance each protein - dna hydrogen bond ( when explicitly included in the model ) appears to contribute -0.15 to -0.27 kcal / mol , depending on the electrostatic model assumed .",
    "+ as expected the electrostatic term is reduced when hydrogen bonds are taken into account separately . for @xmath14 the best scaling coefficient @xmath15 changes from 0.154 to 0.182 upon removal of the term proportional to the number of hydrogen bonds .",
    "+ the correlation between the different contributions is reflected in the changes , with changing dielectric model , of the oons term scaling factor , which is always strongly reduced by the scaling factor ranging from 0.075 to -0.066 .",
    "finally the constant term which takes into account common entropic terms ( which can be estimated to be in the range 20 to 40 kcal / mol ) and the free energy of binding of the reference complex ( which implies the addition of 11.3 kcal / mol ) , expected to be in the range of 30 to 50 kcal / mol , is slightly larger than expected .",
    "+      the oons solvation term is accounting for both apolar and electrostatic solvation terms which should be already taken into account , at least partly , in the distance dependent dielectric constant .",
    "the same calculations described above have been performed using a similar approach in which the solvation term of the binding free energy is taken to be proportional to the polar / apolar accessible surface area of the molecule ( see eq .",
    "[ eq6 ] ) .",
    "the best scaling factors have been determined fitting the set of experimentally measured protein - dna binding affinities ( table 1 ) .",
    "the quality of the computed binding free energies @xmath16 has been assessed evaluating the linear correlation coefficient @xmath6 and the root mean square deviation ( rmsd ) between calculated and experimental values . in order to verify the performance of the model ,",

    "the f - statistic shows that the model is significant ( p @xmath11 0.001 ) . + all the values of the distance dependent dielectric constant which have been tested gave a quite high and similar linear correlation coefficient .",

    "are overestimated whereas binding free energy changes greater than 2 kcal / mol are underestimated in all the cases .",
    "more accurate predictions have been obtained for @xmath8 , in particular for values lower than 1.0 kcal / mol ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the correlation coefficients between calculated and experimental values are 0.684 , 0.745 , 0.728 and 0.739 for @xmath13 , respectively . ]",
    "the optimal scaling coefficients are in the expected range ( table 1 ) , in particular for @xmath12 the constant term @xmath17 is in the range 10 - 20",
    "kcal / mol , moreover the coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 have the right order of magnitude of typically used surface tension coefficients for water biomolecular interface , even if the sign is incorrect .",
    "it should be noted however that there is a strong correlation ( ranging in this case from 0.2 to 0.6 ) between the coefficients of most terms and the coefficient of the constant term .",
    "+ also for the present model the addition of an explicit hydrogen bond term reduces the coefficient of the electrostatic term as could be expected .",
    "+ these results support the conclusion that , in general , there is no advantage in using the detailed solvation models compared to the simpler polar / apolar model , as far as the binding free energy is concerned . based on the range of the scaling coefficients the two models appear of similar quality .",
    "scaled free energy components for the mm / dddc - hp(+hb ) model are reported in table 3 .      in this approach",
    "all structures have been energy - minimized using the generalized born solvent model , then the binding free energy for every molecule has been calculated according to the mm / gbsa model using the eq .",
    "[ eq7 ] . as in the previous cases , we determined the best scaling factors ( and standard deviations according to eq .",

    "the average rmsd and correlation are essentially the same reported for the leave - one - out scheme reported in table 2 .",
    "the standard deviations of the coefficients are essentially the same as reported in table 4 .",
    "our calculation shows that the mm / gbsa(+hb ) model gives the best performances ( @xmath6 = 0.746 ) , although the linear correlation coefficient between calculated and experimental values differs slightly from the best values obtained from the other models .",
    "the f - statistic shows that the model is significant ( p @xmath11 0.001 ) .",
    "+ computed values versus experimental data are reported in figure 3 .",
    "as far as the scaling coefficients are concerned ( see table 4 ) , it is worth noting that addition of an explicit hydrogen bond term has a dramatic effect on the coefficients of van der waals and electrostatic terms , as could be expected , because the latter terms already take into account hydrogen bond energetics . for the mm / gbsa model ( with no explicit term for hydrogen bonds ) the coefficients of the electrostatic and gb solvation terms are 0.16 and 0.14 which correspond to a dielectric constant of @xmath20 .",
    "surface tension coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath18 ( -0.010 and -0.029 respectively ) have the same order of magnitude of the commonly used surface tension coefficient ( ca 0.02 kcal / mol @xmath21 ) , but opposite sign .",
    "however the terms proportional to the solvent accessible surface area are strongly correlated to each other and to the constant term .",
    "+ the constant term is -11.7 kcal / mol , lower than what expected , probably as a consequence of the correlation of this term with the polar and hydrophobic surface area terms ( the linear correlations of the coefficients are 0.51 and 0.75 , respectively ) .",
    "the standard deviation of this term is however very large ( 28.0 kcal / mol ) .",
    "+ scaled free energy components for the mm / gbsa(+hb ) model are reported in table 5 .",
    "the analysis of table 5 shows that the most important feature for computing the binding free energy is the number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds .",
    "the correlation of the associated energy term with the experimental free energy of binding is 0.58 .",
    "other terms are strongly correlated among each other and therefore it is difficult to single out specific contributions .",
    "the correlation between different energetic terms range from -0.99 , for gb solvation energy and coulombic energy , to 0.44 , for gb solvation energy and polar area burial energy term .",
    "+ 18 single base - pair mutants exhibit large ( greater than 2.0 kcal / mol ) unfavourable free energy of binding .",
    "loss of hydrogen bonds contributes for 1 or 1.5 kcal / mol for mutants 14cg , 8at , 8gc , 9at , 18at , 12ta , 12gc , while for other mutants the most important unfavourable contributions come mostly from coulombic and van der waals terms .",
    "it should be noted , however , that solvation terms are correlated with coulombic and van der waals terms . +",
    "this analysis is in general in line with the detailed analysis reported by oobatake et al .",
    "@xcite , although the exact values of energy contributions differ .",
    "the procedure used for computing binding energies may suffer from incomplete relaxation and incomplete conformational sampling .",
    "an approach that has been used in the past for sampling more conformations and reduce the effect of fluctuations is to analyse snapshots from molecular dynamics runs . in many studies",
    "no scaling factor was applied at all , with good results . + we performed 1 ns of md simulations for every structure in order to test the effectiveness of a first principles computation of binding free energies and to check the effect of molecular dynamics relaxation on the computed energies .",
    "we calculated the average value of every component of the binding free energy using snapshots taken every 50 ps , then we used the same set of fitting equations using average values to determine the best scaling factors .",
    "we chose to use the mm / gbsa(+hb ) model for computing binding free energies because it gave good results on the starting structures and the coefficients can be used to monitor the quality of the fitting .",
    "figure 3 reports the mm / gbsa(+hb ) binding free energy values obtained from md simulations versus experimental values . the quality of the computed binding free energies @xmath16 has been assessed evaluating the linear correlation coefficient @xmath6 and the root mean square deviation ( rmsd ) between calculated and experimental values ( see table 6 ) .",
    "results show that md simulations do not improve the prediction capabilities of the model .",
    "actually the linear correlation coefficient calculated averaging over 1.0 ns is 0.356 , much lower than the correlation at t = 0.0 ns .",
    "results obtained averaging over the time interval 0.0 - 0.5 ns , gave a linear correlation coefficient comparable to what obtained with other models on the starting structures ( r = 0.534 ) but lower than the linear correlation coefficient obtained at t = 0.0 ns .",
    "the linear correlation coefficient between experimental values and the results obtained averaging over the time interval 0.5 - 1.0 ns , is @xmath6 = 0.284 , indicating that md causes the loss of any correlation .",
    "+ moreover optimal scaling factors obtained averaging over the time interval 0.5 - 1.0 ns have the tendency to lose any physical meaning ( table 7 ) . when optimal scaling factors obtained on the starting structure are used to compute binding free energies using average values , no correlation is detectable with experimental data .",
    "the value of the binding free energy change of every complex across 1 ns of simulation has been observed to strongly fluctuate , making it difficult to obtain an accurate estimate of it .",
    "+ in order to verify whether this problem could have been circumvented using a larger conformational sampling , the simulations of 10 mutants have been extended to 4 ns , obtaining a total of 400 snapshots for every simulation .",
    "in particular we extended the simulations of the wild type complex and the best and the worst mutants ( g17-c25 and t14-a28 respectively ) with negative results .",
    "although the system is most probably not fully equilibrated , it is reasonable to suspect that even longer ( in the range of few tens ns ) molecular dynamics simulations will not improve the results obtainable on the starting structures .",
    "+ the main reasons of failure of this approach are probably the large conformational fluctuations developing in md simulations and the combination of relatively short molecular dynamics simulations with snapshots energy evaluation using the mm / gbsa(+hb ) continuum model .",
    "large conformational fluctuations observed in md simulations are reflected in energetic fluctuations in the range of tens of kcal / mol , thus posing an issue on the reliability of the free energy average values .",
    "moreover , since we observed that the results could not be improved extending the simulation time , it is reasonable to ascribe the failure of the method , at least partially , to inaccuracies in the force field parametrization .",
    "actually , all force fields are based on numerous approximations , in particular nucleic acid force fields could suffer from two main problems which could give rise to inaccuracies .",
    "the first is that the target experimental data used in the optimization process are typically crystal structures of dna and rna .",
    "however , the presence of the lattice environment in crystals is known to influence the structure of dna , limiting the transferability of crystal data to solution .",
    "the second is the treatment of electrostatics which is crucial in these simulations , given the polyanionic nature of dna . in particular",
    ", the electrostatic polarization , which is an effect that can significantly reduce electrostatic interactions of partial atomic charges , is very important for accurate treatment of interactions in different environments , since significant structural changes of dna may occur in response to environment .",
    "table 8 shows the number of correct predictions , according to the criteria described in the _ methods _ section .",
    "+ in the last column the number of cases in which the difference @xmath22 is lower than 0.3 kcal / mol , that is the number of the more accurate predictions , has been reported .",
    "it should be noted that the fitting of coefficients aims at minimizing the rmsd between calculated and experimental values and not at maximizing the number of `` correct '' predictions . when a simple simulated annealing procedure is applied to the coefficients",
    "the number of correct predictions can be increased by several units .",
    "it is instructive for instance to consider the mm / gbsa(+hb ) model , where 41 `` correct '' predictions can be achieved with minor ( mostly less than 10% ) variations relative to the starting values of coefficients .",
    "+ from this qualitative point of view , the prediction capabilities of the different models can be compared .",
    "the best performing models appear to be the mm / dddc - hp model with @xmath23 . on average",
    "the dddc - hp model performs better than the similar dddc - oons model . for @xmath24 results",
    "are worst than for higher @xmath4 values .",
    "+ molecular dynamics trajectories were analysed similarly , using average values for the different contributions to the free energy of binding .",
    "in particular the lowest number of correct predictions has been obtained averaging over the time interval 0.5 - 1.0 ns , actually there is no cases in which both @xmath25 and @xmath16 are @xmath111.0 kcal / mol and the number of cases in which @xmath25 and @xmath16 are separated by less than 0.3 kcal / mol has been strongly reduced .",
    "+ generally , we observed that the number of cases in which @xmath25 and @xmath16 are both @xmath111.0 kcal / mol decreases while the number of cases in which @xmath25 and @xmath16 are both @xmath26 1.0 kcal / mol remains nearly constant ; however at the same time the number of cases in which @xmath25 and @xmath16 are separated by less than 0.3 kcal / mol strongly decreases , indicating that there is a reduction of the accuracy in reproducing experimental binding energies .",
    "overall this analysis is consistent with the analyses reported in the previous sections .",
    "the optimal scaling coefficients are likely to depend on the complex and mutants studied . in order to verify that such coefficients do not produce wild results when applied on different complexes with similar binding features we considered the @xmath2 or1 complexes which was obtained from crystallographic structure ( pdb i d .",
    "code : 6cro ) after mutation of 14 bases .",
    "the @xmath2 protein belongs to the same family of @xmath0 repressor but to a different domain , according to scop classification @xcite and it has very limited similarity with @xmath0 repressor although they bind dna in a similar fashion .",
    "this system is therefore suited for testing the overall quality of the scaling procedure . also for @xmath2 a set of measurements for each mutant of the or1 sequence is available @xcite .",
    "when all contributions to the binding free energy , computed according to the mm / gbsa(+hb ) model , are scaled by the coefficients determined on the @xmath0 repressor complexes the computed energies show a remarkable correlation coefficient of 0.62 with the experimental values , although the binding energies are overestimated by approximately 10 kcal / mol .",
    "this fact could reflect differences in the entropic contribution to binding ( arising from restriction in side chain and backbone mobility ) that are likely to be different for the two systems .",
    "indeed , the crystallized @xmath2 protein is roughly only two thirds of the repressor sequence . notwithstanding the differences in overall binding energy , the binding differences for the mutants are on average reproduced by the energetic model .",
    "+ as a further test , we performed the reverse analysis where the scaling coefficients are obtained on the @xmath2-or1 complex and validated on the @xmath0 repressor - operator complex .",
    "also in this case the computed energies show a remarkable correlation coefficient of 0.69 with the experimental values , although they are all underestimated by approximately 16 kcal / mol .",

    "+ iv ) one thousand replicates of the original data has been generated with the column elements containing the experimental data randomly swapped .",
    "the average of the correlation coefficient between swapped experimental data and fitted data has been computed together with the standard deviation .",
    "the results of this computation ( not reported ) fully supports the results of the statistical analyses described above ; + finally , a useful alternative to assess the quality of @xmath16 predictions and to compare the different models from a qualitative point of view , consists in determining the number of `` correct predictions '' , defined as the number of cases in which both @xmath25 and @xmath16 are @xmath111.0 kcal / mol , or @xmath261.0 kcal / mol , or else separated by less than 0.3 kcal / mol . the threshold value of 1.0 kcal / mol requires some explanations .",
    "the experimental values of the free energy change relative to the wild - type operator @xmath1 have been calculated using the equation @xmath25 = - 0.546 ln ( @xmath81 of substituted sequence)/(@xmath81 of @xmath1 ) after having determined the dissociation constant of every mutant .",
    "it is simple to verify that the threshold value of 1.0 kcal / mol corresponds to a remarkable reduction in the dissociation constant of the mutant ( ca .",
    "5-fold ) , with respect to the dissociation constant of the wild - type operator ( @xmath81 of @xmath1 = @xmath82 ) , whereas values of @xmath83 higher than 1.0 kcal / mol correspond to a reduction in the dissociation constant from 5 ( @xmath25 = 1.0 kcal / mol ) to 25-fold ( @xmath25=3.4 , which is the maximum value of @xmath25 ) .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to define @xmath16 as correct , if both @xmath25 and @xmath16 are in one of the defined intervals or even if the difference @xmath22 is lower than 0.3 kcal / mol , which corresponds to a ratio between the dissociation constant of a mutant and the dissociation constant of the wild - type complex lower than 2.0 .",
    "+      one thousand random dna sequences were generated and the corresponding structural models were generated by performing mutations on the double stranded dna in the complex crystal structure using the program whatif @xcite .",
    "the resulting dataset of complexes was assumed to be representative of non - specific protein - dna complexes .",
    "we are interested in understanding how reliable is the method for predicting putative binding sites .",
    "the so - called z - score of the specific bound sequence compared to random sequences has been considered .",
    "the z - score is defined here as the distance of the free energy computed for the specific bound 17-mer ( @xmath83 ) from the average non - specific binding energy ( @xmath84 ) , normalized by the standard deviation of the computed non - specific binding energies ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "@xmath86 averages are performed over the one thousand random sequences .",
    "a large z - score implies that the specific bound sequence can be distinguished from other non - specific bound sequences .",
    "the structures were energy minimized using the same protocol used for mm / gbsa free energy estimation . for all minimized complexes the coulombic energy , van der waals energy , gb solvation energy , polar and apolar surface accessible area and intermolecular hydrogen bonds number were tabulated . for each model @xmath44 of the 1000 random dna sequence complexes",
    "the binding energy @xmath87 has been computed using different amounts of the experimental information available .",
    "different analyses , detailed in the results section , were performed .",
    "+ the possibility of using the data computed on the set of non - specific complexes for defining a profile of the recognized dna sequences has been explored as follows .",
    "the calculated binding energy values for the set of non - specific complexes were summarised in a set of 68 values corresponding to the average contribution to the binding free energy of each possible of the 4 bases at each of the possible 17 bound sequence positions .",
    "these 68 values have been derived as follows .",
    "possible substitutions are indexed from 1 to 4 for a , c , g and t , respectively .",
    "a @xmath88 matrix @xmath50 was set where each element @xmath89 is 1.0 or 0.0 if the base at position @xmath90 ( rounded at the closer upper integer ) has index @xmath91 in sequence i. the set of @xmath92 substitution free energies @xmath93 were found by solving ( in a root mean square error sense ) the overdetermined equation @xmath94 .",
    "the resulting 68-element vector @xmath63 was arranged in a @xmath95 matrix .",
    "variants on this procedure are described in the results section according to the level of information available included in the analysis .",
    "+      the free energy matrix derived from the analysis of non - specific protein - dna complexes was used to score all 17-mer subsequences in the bacteriophage @xmath0 genome ( accession number : nc_001416.1 , 48502 base - pairs ) on both strands . in principle",
    "the score represents the free energy of binding of the 17-mer considered .",
