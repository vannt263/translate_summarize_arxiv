    "<S> the msd components in the two cases can not be related through a simple time rescaling : for @xmath109 , we see clearly the expected @xmath110 behavior for the free - draining chain ( local slopes are shown in the inset ) , while the exponent is pushed up to @xmath111 with hydrodynamics .    , @xmath79 , for a chain with @xmath85 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 . </S>",

    "<S> mft relaxation times @xmath82 are marked by circles , while the crossover times @xmath116 are marked by vertical dashed lines . ]    through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , the msd can be used to extract the viscoelastic properties of the chain : fourier transforming the msd functions gives the imaginary parts of the end - to - end and self response functions of the polymer end - points , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , which are defined as @xmath119 , @xmath120 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath121 and @xmath122 are the complex oscillation amplitudes resulting from a small force @xmath123 applied to one or between both ends of the chain in addition to the prestretching tension @xmath12 . using the mft </S>",

    "<S> the mode number cutoff @xmath129 is chosen to roughly model the discrete nature of the chain at length scales comparable to the bead diameter , but results at larger length scales are independent of the cutoff  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the good quantitative agreement with bd in the time domain is carried over to frequency space : the simulation trends are accurately reproduced by the mft . for @xmath132 , we see a mainly elastic end - to - end response , @xmath133 , with an effective spring constant @xmath134 . </S>",
    "<S> the self response of the end - point at these small frequencies is proportional to the center - of - mass mobility , @xmath135 . for @xmath136 </S>",
    "<S> we pass into the more interesting high - frequency regime governed by the complex nature of normal mode relaxation under tension and hydrodynamic interactions ( up to the ultraviolet cutoff at @xmath137 , above which the discreteness of the chain dominates ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of tension in this regime have been directly observed in cytoskeletal networks through microrheology  @xcite : with increasing force the dynamic compliance is reduced , and the high - frequency scaling changes from @xmath138 ( the behavior of a relaxed semiflexible network ) to @xmath139 . </S>",
    "<S> we find both of these stiffening effects in our mft results , with an important correction : unlike a network , where hydrodynamics is screened , in the single polymer case the long - range interactions modify the local slopes : rather than @xmath140 and @xmath141 , we see @xmath142 at weak force changing to @xmath143 at strong force . </S>",
    "<S> this correction , along with the full crossover behavior of the imaginary response  proportional to the power spectral density ( psd)should be observable in future nanorheology experiments for single semiflexible chains ( i.e. the afm techniques already used to extract the psd of flexible polymers  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> though we have demonstrated the accuracy of the mft , one must be careful to consider the limitations of our approach . for small forces , @xmath144 , and extremely long chains , @xmath145 , </S>",
    "<S> one expects self - avoidance to be important  @xcite , which is entirely left out of the mft theory . </S>",
    "<S> ( for dna with @xmath146 nm , excluded volume effects would appear at @xmath147 @xmath148 m . ) in the opposite limit of extremely stiff chains , with @xmath149 , we find another problem : for a system that is nearly a rigid rod , no gaussian model will be able to capture the @xmath43 dynamics . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ hydrostiff](b ) we show @xmath150 for a chain with @xmath85 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the mft underestimates the @xmath43 relaxation time by an order of magnitude , saturating to equilibrium much quicker than the bd result . </S>",
    "<S> however the @xmath44 gaussian theory is still remarkably precise , deviating @xmath153 from the bd curve throughout the entire time range . </S>",
    "<S> this provides us with an alternative solution : use the @xmath44 mft results in combination with wba to estimate the @xmath43 quantities . </S>",
    "<S> the key relation is @xmath154 , valid in the stiff limit . using the @xmath44 mft estimate of @xmath155 , </S>",
    "<S> we have derived a second - order perturbation expansion for @xmath156 ( details are in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> vi of @xcite ) , yielding the red curve in fig .  [ hydrostiff](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a much better agreement with bd ( @xmath157 deviation ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus with the help of wba , we can extend the scope of our gaussian mft even to the rigid rod limit .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have developed an anisotropic mft for the dynamics of semiflexible chains under tension , whose most notable features are an unprecedented quantitative accuracy  verified through bd simulations  and a broad range of validity , not restricted to the weakly bending regime . </S>",
    "<S> understanding kinetics of single stretched chains is interesting in itself ( or as the first step toward more elaborate theories of stressed networks ) , but it can also be exploited in other contexts : optical tweezer force - clamp experiments depend sensitively on the dynamical response of the dna handles that are attached to the object of interest , whether a nucleic acid hairpin or protein  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the implications of our theory in analyzing such experiments will be pursued in future work .    </S>",
