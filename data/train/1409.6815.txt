    "iron - based superconductors ( fesc ) possess magnetically ordered spin - density wave ( sdw ) or possibly nel order in close proximity to superconductivity @xcite . in general , the topology of the fermi surface plays a crucial role in determining the type of order@xcite .",
    "this sensitivity was demonstrated explicitly for single - layer fese@xcite which may become superconducting already above 60k possibly due to the interplay of intraband and interband cooper pairing@xcite . in the superconducting phase ,",
    "the structure , size , and potentially symmetry of the gap function @xmath6 is expected to react sensitively to small changes in external control parameters such as doping or pressure@xcite . additionally , @xmath6 reflects the dominant channel for cooper pairing and allows insight into unconventional pairing mechanisms driven by band structure dependent electronic interactions .",
    "finding a way to monitor changes of the pairing state may provide a possible pathway for a quantitative description of superconductivity in the fescs .",
    "however , one needs the proper experimental tools .",
    "one of the hallmarks of superconductivity in @xmath0 is the observation of the neutron resonance@xcite which favors the @xmath5 state predicted by mazin and coworkers @xcite , but still leaves space for an @xmath7 state driven by orbital fluctuations @xcite . in either case , the nesting between the central hole bands and the electron bands takes advantage of strong interactions at short distances corresponding to a large momentum transfer at @xmath8 ( in the 1fe unit cell ) .",
    "similarly , the electron bands themselves can gain from @xmath9 scattering of nearly equal strength@xcite .",
    "hence , two unconventional pairing states @xmath5 and @xmath2 resulting from @xmath8 and @xmath9 scattering , respectively , can be expected to compete and may be tuned by intentionally changing the band structure .",
    "the close proximity of these pairing instabilities leaves spectroscopic fingerprints . in the single particle spectra one",
    "expects characteristic momentum dependence of the gaps on the fermi surfaces of multi - band systems .",
    "if the gap changes sign between different sheets of the fermi surface , the quasi - particle interference observed in tunneling spectra may demonstrate the influence from applied magnetic fields @xcite . in a light scattering experiment new or emergent collective modes",
    "are expected in addition to the more familiar pair breaking peak at an energy twice the gap maximum@xcite .",
    "generally these collective modes can appear in the particle - hole channel or particle - particle channel ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 channels in the language of nambu ) either separately or together .",
    "a critical question is whether these modes can be visible in raman scattering measurements .",
    "for example , narrow lines at lower energies originate from either residual excitonic interactions between the electrons of a broken pair@xcite or josephson - like excitations @xcite between different bands in multi - band systems .",
    "in addition , there may be modes associated with coupled amplitude fluctuations of the superconducting and density wave gaps when charge density wave ( cdw ) ordering occurs@xcite .",
    "a coupling between the superconducting and cdw channels allows a @xmath10 collective amplitude mode to be visible in raman scattering measurements .    in both nbse@xmath12 and the a15 compounds v@xmath13si and nb@xmath13sn , resolution - limited lines below twice the gap edge have been observed@xcite , but the only evidence for amplitude modes was the approximate conservation of the integrated spectral weight of the in - gap mode and the phonon - like excitation either as a function of applied field @xcite or temperature @xcite .",
    "there are no systematic studies on leggett modes but the data in mgb@xmath12 suggest that there is a mode in the right range of energy which originates from a weak coupling between the two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath14 band which possesses a large gap and the more 3d @xmath15 band @xcite .    first predicted by bardasis and schrieffer ( bs ) @xcite , depending on the sign of the residual interaction , excitonic or electron pair bound states can be formed .",
    "these excitonic or electron pair modes may exist as sharp features below the gap in @xmath16wave superconductors or in @xmath17wave superconductors they may be damped considerably due to the existence of quasiparticles from the presence of gap nodes@xcite .",
    "bs modes have been observed in superfluid @xmath18he @xcite where they correspond to bound pairs of rotons@xcite , and could be an alternative explanation for the in - gap modes in a15 compounds v@xmath13si and nb@xmath13sn @xcite . in both of these compounds ,",
    "structural transitions from a high temperature - cubic to a low - temperature - tetragonal lattice occur above the superconducting transition temperature @xcite , but no evidence of a cdw appears at lower temperatures .",
    "nevertheless a spectral weight transfer from the phonon into the collective modes appears below the superconducting transition temperature , similar to the case of nbse@xmath12 .",
    "recently , narrow in - gap modes were observed in @xmath0 and interpreted in terms of bs modes @xcite . in this case , the intensity does not come from a phonon , some of which gain rather than lose spectral weight upon entering the superconducting state , but is drained from the pair - breaking peaks .",
    "this experimental observation is qualitatively different from what was found in previous studies @xcite , but the effect was predicted specifically for the iron - based compounds with competing @xmath16 and @xmath17wave pairing states @xcite .",
    "therefore , the earlier qualitative argumentation @xcite needs to be augmented both experimentally and theoretically .    in this work",
    "we present experimental polarization - dependent raman spectra for various temperatures between the low - temperature limit of approximately 8k and 46k .",
    "in addition , we performed weak coupling calculations for @xmath19 on a realistic band structure taking into account interactions between the five bands close to the fermi level .",
    "these theoretical results and observation of a bcs - like temperature dependence of an emergent mode at 140@xmath20 allow us to uniquely identify it as a @xmath2 bs exciton . from the energy position and the spectral weight of the exciton",
    ", we estimate the relative strength of the subdominant @xmath2 pairing channel to be more than half as strong as the dominant @xmath5 channel .",
    "our results suggest that the @xmath2 pairing channel may indeed become dominant when the @xmath5 interaction is reduced , for example , by the absence of hole pockets at the center of the brillouin zone .",
    "in @xmath0 , superconductivity - induced features were found in all symmetries experimentally accessible with light polarizations in the fe planes@xcite . although the crystal unit cell involves 2 iron atoms per unit cell due to the staggered positioning of the arsenic above and below the fe planes , it is convenient to instead make group theory reference in the 1 fe unit cell where polarizations and selection rules can be framed in terms of polarizations along the fe - fe bond direction . in the @xmath1 spectra ( 1fe unit cell )",
    "the observation of very narrow modes at low temperature suggests the existence of collective excitations and their interpretation in terms of excitonic bs modes .",
    "however , the temperature dependence or the energy and emergence of this mode requires further study .    before describing the quantitative theoretical analysis in the zero - temperature limit , we present an additional set of experiments in the range @xmath21k , since we expect that the in - gap modes and the usual pair - breaking features depend differently on temperature in systems with intermediate to strong coupling .",
    "while the in - gap modes should by and large follow the temperature dependence of the single - particle gap@xcite , interactions that give rise to raman peaks in the normal state reduce the temperature dependence of the pair breaking features@xcite .",
    "the experiments were performed on a freshly cleaved surface of the same optimally hole - doped single crystal of @xmath22 which has been used in previous studies and possesses a superconducting transition at @xmath23k@xcite .",
    "we used an ar ion laser emitting at 514 nm and a standard scanning spectrometer with the sample held in a cryogenically pumped vacuum .",
    "we measured spectra with linear polarizations of the incoming and outgoing photons oriented perpendicular and at 45@xmath24 with respect to the fe  fe direction ( 0@xmath24 w.r.t .",
    "the crystallographic axes ) to project the @xmath1 and @xmath25 symmetries .",
    "no subtraction procedure was applied as the @xmath25 component was found to be weak .",
    "the @xmath1 spectra contain all relevant features .",
    "the spectra measured at various temperatures between 8k and 46k are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t](a ) . at low temperature one observes two prominent peaks at 140 and 170@xmath20 and a weak one at 70@xmath20 which were previously identified with collective modes @xcite .",
    "the mode at 140@xmath20 has the smallest low - temperature width . following the positions of the three peaks ( dashed vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : t](a ) show the low - temperature limit ) indicates distinct differences , with the mode at 140@xmath20 displaying the strongest shift and the peaks at 70@xmath20 and the gap edge at 170@xmath20 ( open circle ) varying only weakly .",
    "the positions are determined following a background subtraction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : t](b ) ) . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : t](a ) , the positions of the two high - energy peaks relative to their low - temperature limiting values are shown along with the bcs prediction for the energy gap .",
    "only the mode at 140@xmath20 is close to the mean - field expectation in striking similarity with the single - particle gaps@xcite , and we conclude that the mode at 140@xmath20 is the only candidate for a bs exciton . with increasing temperature the width of the line increases due to quasiparticle damping making it indiscernible at sample temperatures above 28k .     in @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "( a ) the spectra measured above 8k are consecutively shifted up by 0.2 units .",
    "the pair - breaking features ( open symbols ) and the collective mode ( full circles ) depend differently on temperature as shown in the inset ( having a suppressed energy zero ) .",
    "the pair - breaking maximum exhibits a temperature dependence that is different from bcs due to interaction effects@xcite .",
    "( b ) the peak energies were determined by fitting the spectra with two lorentzians and a smooth background . ]",
    "the additional experimental observation of the temperature dependence facilitates a clear distinction between the various spectral features and motivates us to explain the 70 and 170@xmath20 modes in terms of pair - breaking and identify only the line at 140@xmath20 with a bs exciton .",
    "this considerably simplifies the calculations .",
    "nevertheless , it remains crucially important to work with a realistic band structure , since the vertex corrections result from interband terms @xcite rather than from intraband anisotropies of the interaction potential @xmath26 as derived first by bardasis and schrieffer @xcite and discussed in detail later in the context of light scattering @xcite .",
    "the model employed in this study is based on a realistic tight - binding bandstructure derived from dft / lda estimates @xcite to provide a quantitative analysis of the raman spectra for optimally hole doped @xmath22 in the superconducting state .",
    "since the experiments show evidence of a bound state inside the gap in addition to the superconducting pair - breaking features , vertex corrections must be considered .",
    "physically the vertex corrections describe the final - state interaction between the two electrons of a cooper pair which have been broken by a photon such that the model accounts for both the pair - breaking effect and the final - state interaction on a realistic 3d multi - band tight - binding bandstructure .",
    "the band structure is generated from a tight - binding approximation to the five fe @xmath27-orbitals developed by graser _",
    "@xcite for undoped @xmath28 , with the fermi energy shifted down by 144mev with respect to the original bandstructure to account for the substitution of 40% ba by k which adds 0.2 holes per fe atom and reduces the filling to 5.8 . transforming the system from an orbital basis to a band basis",
    "gives five bands of which four cross the fermi level including the two hole bands in the brillouin zone ( bz ) center , one hole band at the @xmath29-point , and an electron band encircling the @xmath30-point .",
    "the presence of the 2fe unit cell requires a backfolding of the 1fe bz , achieved by adding another five bands , shifted by @xmath31 , to the existing ones .",
    "this vector accounts for the additional translational symmetry of the 2fe bz .",
    "five of the resulting ten bands cross the fermi level : three hole bands in the bz center ( h1 , h2 , and h3 from the inside out ) and two electron bands around the @xmath30-point ( e1 and e2 from the outside in ) .",
    "the fermi surfaces of the hole bands intersect each other on lines as do the electron bands . since the intersecting bands derive from the same orbitals the degeneracies are lifted@xcite by any small residual interaction : we used 25mev for all bands and show later that the hybridization energy influences the raman spectra only weakly .    for calculating the raman response the momentum",
    "dependent vertices are needed @xcite .",
    "this is tractable only in the effective - mass approximation , as justified here @xcite , since the incident photons are lower than resonance energies .",
    "the related vertices @xmath32 for symmetry @xmath33 ( @xmath34 , @xmath1 , @xmath35 ) are derived numerically from the dispersion @xmath36 of band @xmath37 , given by @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40    and shown in fig .",

    "the black frame represents the 1fe bz ranging from @xmath42 to @xmath15 in each dimension @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "there are three fermi surfaces in the center and two at each face ( the outer ones are cut open to visualize the inner ones ) showing the hole bands and electron bands , respectively .",
    "all three symmetries have a common color scale that shows the sign and intensity of the raman vertex at the fermi surface .",
    "the hole bands around the bz edges are equivalent to those in the center and are omitted for simplicity . ]    although the bands are calculated for the 2fe bz , we continue to use the 1fe bz reference frame because the experiments clearly show that the symmetry selection rules are dominated by the 1fe cell @xcite and because in the 2fe bz cell the role of the @xmath1 and @xmath35 projections would be interchanged in a counterintuitive way such that the @xmath2 type of interaction between the electron bands would appear in the @xmath35 channel .",
    "in fact , the 1fe bz captures most of the features and simplifies the argumentation considerably while for the 2fe bz improvements are found only on a quantitative level while the results are qualitatively similar .",
    "figures  [ fig : vertices](b ) and ( c ) show directly that the strongest contributions for the @xmath1 and @xmath35 spectra come from the outer electron band . for a more quantitative statement ,",
    "the contribution from superconductivity to the raman response @xmath46 is evaluated by an intraband bare bubble approximation , @xmath47 where the @xmath48 is given by the tsuneto function@xcite , where @xmath49 is the raman shift .",
    "neglecting band structure effects the expression for the response at @xmath19 can be transformed into @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes an average over fermi surface sheet @xmath37 .",
    "the only relevant physical parameters which are varied to achieve the best agreement with the data are @xmath52-dependent gap structures @xmath53 for each fermi surface .",
    "in addition , the relative intensities of the spectra are scaled by 0.3 , 0.6 , and 1 for @xmath34 , @xmath1 , and @xmath35 , respectively . for the @xmath34 spectra screening",
    "is included @xcite , but the effects are found to be very small since the gaps on the electron and hole bands are quite symmetric ( except for the outer hole band ) , and the concomitant sign change of the raman vertex nearly cancels all the screening contributions@xcite .",
    "in addition to the response at lowest order , corrections from the final state interaction between the two single electrons created by cooper pair breaking by photons have to be considered @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of bound states becomes important whenever there are anisotropies in the pairing potential @xcite corresponding to interactions beyond ground state cooper pairing .",
    "since this competition is important in the fescs because of bands at high - symmetry points , we evaluated higher orders of perturbation theory ( vertex corrections ) .",
    "here , contributions originating from a @xmath27-wave attractive coupling between the outer electron bands will be included that lead to a collective excitonic mode in @xmath1 symmetry@xcite .",
    "the additional coupling @xmath54 contributes to the anisotropy of @xmath26 and is assumed to be relevant only between the outer electron bands ( e1 in table  [ tab : arpes ] ) .",
    "the influence on the response from e2 has been found to be negligible .",
    "we further assume that @xmath26 is separable and varies as @xmath55 with @xmath54 proportional to @xmath56 and normalized in a way that @xmath57 measures the strength of the @xmath27-wave interaction .",
    "@xmath54 causes multiple scattering processes and leads to an additive term in the response of the outer electron bands as discussed in detail in ref . where @xmath58 @xmath59 is the response kernel ( see eq .",

    "the model has been applied to the experimental data with the fitted results shown in fig . [",
    "fig : fits ] compared to experiments .",
    "the raw data @xcite are a superposition of the electronic continuum and phonons .",
    "if the normal state spectra are subtracted from those in the superconducting state only superconductivity - induced features survive .",
    "if the phonons are not sensitive to the superconducting transition they disappear completely since the normal state temperature dependence is already too weak to be visible below 50k . in the case of the fescs",
    "most of the phonons are indeed weakly coupled @xcite and disappear here .",

    "all three symmetries show depletion of spectral weight in the low energy region and an enhancement for energies larger than about 160 @xmath64 .",
    "this behavior clearly indicates the existence of a superconducting gap .",
    "another common feature is a small enhancement at about 70 @xmath64 , however , the sharp peak at 140 @xmath64 in the @xmath1 channel , which is almost resolution limited , does not have a correspondence in the other symmetries and can be identified as a @xmath27-wave collective mode .",
    "the following quantitative analysis is designed to support this interpretation and to reveal properties of both the superconducting gaps and the collective mode .",
    "an ideal starting point for analysis is the @xmath35 spectrum which is free of collective modes and screening effects .",

    "one finds that only the contributions from the outer electron band ( e1 , purple in fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] ) and the middle hole band ( h2 , orange ) are large enough to contribute significantly to the response above 160@xmath64 , with the contribution from the outer electron band approximately twice as large as that of the middle hole band .",

    "a momentum dependent @xmath54 must be utilized which reduces the response only at the gap maximum ( rather than the minimum ) while leading to the excitonic peak at 140@xmath64 .",
    "the best choice is a @xmath27-wave form for @xmath54 which is small along diagonal directions to maximize the coupling between the gap maxima of the outer electron bands and , in addition , is proportional to the @xmath1 vertex ( eq .  [ eq : ramanverticesb1 g ] ) .",
    "the latter specialization is necessary since the linear @xmath1 vertex in eq .",

    "[ fig : vertices](c ) ] and would nearly cancel the weight of the collective mode for a weakly @xmath82-dependent @xmath81 .",
    "the reason for this artifact originates in the fine structure of the @xmath1 vertex which enters to lowest order quadratically , but linearly in the vertex .",
    "the choice of @xmath83 is physically justified and ensures that the spectral weights of both the bare bubble and the vertex correction come from the same parts of the fermi surface .",

    "in fact , the transfer of spectral weight encodes the relative strength between the @xmath61 and @xmath27 channels .",

    "the binding energy is as large as one third of @xmath85 yielding @xmath86 .",
    "a similar ratio was used in the model calculations of ref .. the related transfer of approximately one half of the spectral weight from the pair - breaking maximum into the bound state [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] ] is consistent with the energy shift .",
    "this rather high fraction highlights that the subdominant @xmath27-wave channel lies in close proximity to the @xmath61-wave channel such that if the @xmath61-wave channel weakens , for instance as a result of a change of the fermi surface , a new dominant symmetry emerges and a bs mode would flip identity as a subdominant @xmath16wave bound state exciton .",
    "we speculate , that this could be realized in fese [ ] and alkali - doped selenides such as @xmath87 although the pairing symmetry in these systems is still a matter of intense discussion.@xcite",
    "we studied the temperature dependence of the @xmath1 raman spectra in @xmath0 and proposed a realistic model calculation for the superconducting response at low temperatures that reproduces the spectra almost quantitatively .",
    "the temperature dependence observed for the prominent peaks and the theoretical analysis demonstrate that only the @xmath1 mode at 140@xmath20 has all features expected for a bs mode in the presence of competing pairing symmetries : it lies below twice the gap edge , has an almost resolution limited width , drains energy from the pair - breaking peaks , and has a temperature dependence which is dominated by that of the single - particle gap .",
    "the coupling parameter in the subdominant @xmath2 channel reaches 60% of the prevailing @xmath61 pairing state making @xmath2 pairing a candidate for materials without central hole bands .",
    "the @xmath2 channel competes with the @xmath61 ground state ( independent of whether it is @xmath5 or @xmath7 ) since the gaps on electron bands have the same sign whereas the @xmath2 channel would lead to a phase difference of @xmath15 between neighboring electron bands .",
    "although the @xmath27 channel is already quite strong in @xmath0 the gaps on the various fermi surfaces are not very anisotropic yet . for this reason @xmath3 is relatively high , and",
    "the density of states between the large and the small gaps is sufficiently small on the relevant bands thus keeping the damping of the excitonic mode small .",
    "if the ratio of the coupling strengths comes closer to one the frustration between the @xmath61 and @xmath27 channels increases , the gaps become more anisotropic , @xcite and consequently @xmath3 decreases .",
    "an existing bs mode would then be damped strongly and hardly visible .",
    "this scenario could , in fact , apply for @xmath88 .",
    "if , on the other hand , the central hole bands disappear such as in @xmath87 or appropriately annealed fese@xcite the @xmath27 channel would prevail and nodeless @xmath2 pairing could be established .",
    "since the gap is then quasi - isotropic @xmath3 can be comparably high as in the @xmath61 channel . from this point of view the transition temperatures in the cuprates",
    "are not yet maximal since the gap has nodes on the fermi surface . in any case ,",

    "the simplest elementary cell has just one fe atom per quadratic unit cell .",
    "this choice is motivated by the low - energy band structure of the fescs being derived only from fe @xmath89 orbitals .",
    "the resulting five bands reproduce the fermi surfaces qualitatively but the magnetism can not be treated appropriately . from the view point of",
    "light scattering the 1fe cell proves sufficient for a qualitative understanding of the selection rules @xcite .",
    "however , the backfolding due to the     symmetry for ( a ) 1fe and ( b ) 2fe zone vertices .",
    "the gap parameters are unchanged . the insets show the bands for both cases .",
    "the difference between the @xmath34 spectra is the biggest one of all symmetries . ]",
    "inclusion of the as atoms and the entire zone of @xmath90 , having a body centered tetragonal unit cell , changes the band structure considerably and influences also the selection rules @xcite .",
    "in addition , the backfolding changes the spectral weight on the bands @xcite further complicating the evaluation of one- and two - particle response functions . in our study",
    "we found good agreement upon using the band structure of the 2fe unit cell .",
    "in addition to these calculations we redid some of the calculations in the 1fe cell . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1fevs2fe ] we show the results for @xmath34 symmetry .",
    "while the overall shape is conserved there are minor but significant differences around the gap maximum .",
    "therefore , if numerical studies are performed the 2fe cell is preferable although the symmetry assignment is better done in the 1fe cell since otherwise the generic meaning of the respective symmetries gets compromised .",
    "for instance , the @xmath91 symmetry being projected in the @xmath1 spectra is the proper symmetry for both nematic fluctuations and the subdominant @xmath27 pairing channel discussed here . in the 2fe cell",
    "one would have to switch to the @xmath35 or @xmath92 channel which appears awkward .",
    "the backfolding makes the electron bands overlap . since the electrons belong to the same orbitals the bands hybridize at the intersection points . as was shown by mazin and coworkers @xcite and by eiter _",
    "_ @xcite the cross section may be enhanced substantially at the hybridization point for the resulting increased band curvature and the spectra may change accordingly . therefore",
    ", we also studied the effect of hybridization by calculating the @xmath1 raman spectra for various hybridization energies @xmath93 and plot the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : hybridization ] .",
    "@xmath1 is the most important symmetry in this context since the electron bands are the battle ground of the @xmath5 and @xmath2 pairing channels .",
    "although the fermi surface shape clearly changes the spectra show only minor differences since the integrated spectral weight around the hybridization lines is almost independent of @xmath93 as opposed to the results for @xmath95 @xcite . we conclude that the influence of the hybridization does not complicate our argumentation .",
    "rather the results are robust and show only small quantitative differences for the 1fe and 2fe basis ."
