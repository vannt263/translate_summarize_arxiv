    "spontaneous symmetry breakdown is a necessity in theoretical descriptions of electroweak phenomena .",
    "we know of no other way to unite the principle of gauge symmetry with the description of massive vector bosons . while gauge symmetry is required in the theoretical description of electroweak physics in order to get meaningful predictions at the quantum level , the existence of the massive vector bosons @xmath4 and @xmath5 is an experimental fact since their discovery at lep .",
    "although the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is well tested even at the quantum level in several cases , there is no sign of the higgs boson so far .",
    "up to now only bounds on the higgs boson mass(es ) could be extracted from high energy collision experiments .",
    "these bounds are always obtained under the hypothesis that a certain model of the higgs sector describes the data . however , as there is no higgs signal yet , the choice of model for the higgs sector is rather unconstrained .",
    "therefore , extensions of the sm higgs sector have to be considered seriously in phenomenology .",
    "such extended higgs sectors would also be considered as low energy effective theories of new physics models beyond the sm , which are proposed to describe physics at higher energies than the electroweak scale .",
    "supersymmetry is one of the examples for such new physics scenarios , which requires at least two scalar doublet fields in the higgs sector .",
    "apart from supersymmetry , there are varieties of new physics models most of which have been proposed during the last decade , such as extra dimension models @xcite , the little higgs models @xcite and others .",
    "the low energy effective theories for some of these models predict extended higgs sectors .",
    "non - minimal higgs sectors are also considered in models with strongly interacting dynamics for the symmetry breaking such as top - color models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some models designed to explain tiny neutrino masses @xcite , cp - violation @xcite , and electroweak baryogenesis @xcite also require an extension of the minimal higgs sector of the sm .    from the phenomenological point of view , such extensions of the higgs sector have to meet two major restrictions from experiments :",
    "a ) the electroweak rho - parameter has to be one up to a few per mille and b ) large flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) have to be absent . by discarding models",
    "which do not meet these criteria or meet them only by fine - tuned choices of model parameters , one ends up with models which have @xmath6 and no fcnc at tree - level . in particular",
    ", it is well known that all models with an arbitrary number of isospin @xmath7-doublets and -singlets can be of that type @xcite by imposing discrete symmetries to avoid fcnc .",
    "the two higgs doublet model ( thdm ) is the model with the minimal extension of the sm higgs sector , which leads to new phenomena in the matter and gauge field sector . in the thdm ,",
    "tree level fcnc can be eliminated by imposing a discrete symmetry , under which there are two possibilities depending on its charge assignment @xcite ; i.e. , ( type i ) only one of the higgs doublets gives mass to the fermions , and ( type ii ) one gives mass to the up - type quarks and the other to the down - type quarks and charged leptons .",
    "the higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) is a special case of the type ii thdm .",
    "as the general thdm may be considered as a low energy description of other new physics models , it is an interesting question whether one can distinguish experimentally between the mssm and such a model .",
    "the question about the new physics model underlying the higgs sector can be addressed only after the existence of higgs particles has been established experimentally .",
    "the higgs search program at high energy colliders divides basically into three steps : a ) discovery of the higgs boson(s ) , b ) measurement of fundamental properties like its mass , width , spin , parity etc . , and c ) determination of the underlying model of the higgs sector ; i.e. , the measurement of the higgs bosons couplings to other particles and to themselves and the measurement of quantum effects . the current paper deals with an example which might contribute to last step .",
    "as is well known , the discovery of a charged higgs boson would be an unambiguous sign of an extended higgs sector . at hadron colliders ,",
    "the main production mechanisms are top - quark decay in top - quark pair production if @xmath8 @xcite and single @xmath9 production by bottom - gluon scattering and gluon fusion ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 and charge conjugated ) if @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we study @xmath13 production at hadron colliders .",
    "this process is not a main production process for the charged higgs boson , but it turns out to be strongly model dependent in contrast to the main production mechanisms .",
    "after the discovery of a charged higgs boson , the observation of this process could potentially help to unravel the underlying model of the higgs sector .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to demonstrate this possibility by studying the predictions of the mssm and thdm in comparison .",
    "the mssm prediction for @xmath13 production at hadron colliders has been studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "especially , the detectability of @xmath13 production at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) in the framework of the mssm has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite which concludes with rather poor prospects .",
    "we reconsider this process in the thdm , and study discriminative features with respect to the mssm .",
    "the cross section is evaluated in the thdm in a wide parameter range .",
    "we exclude areas of parameter space by the requirement of vacuum stability @xcite and perturbative unitarity @xcite .",
    "experimental results , such as on the rho - parameter @xcite , the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xcite and @xmath14 @xcite are also taken into account .",
    "we find that in the regions of parameter space which are not excluded by the theoretical requirements and the experimental constraints , a large enhancement of the hadronic cross section can be obtained as compared to the mssm prediction .",
    "therefore , in certain cases , the signal can be detectable at the lhc .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review the thdm and present the restrictions for the thdm parameters , derived from theoretical constraints and present experimental data .",
    "section 3 deals with the essentials of the @xmath0 production process at hadron colliders . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the thdm prediction for the production cross section in comparison with the mssm prediction , having regard to all the parameter restrictions discussed in section 2 .",
    "our conclusions and the appendix follow .",
    "the thdm contains two scalar weak isospin doublets @xmath15 with hypercharge @xmath16 . conventionally , there are two types of thdms which are characterized by the way the scalar doublets are coupled to fermions . in type",

    "are automatically absent at tree level @xcite . here",
    ", we consider a thdm of type ii .",
    "the higgs sector of the cp - conserving thdm can be described by the following potential @xcite : @xmath17 ^ 2\\\\ + \\lambda_4 \\big [ ( \\phi_1^\\dagger \\phi_1)(\\phi_2^\\dagger \\phi_2 )          - ( \\phi_1^\\dagger \\phi_2)(\\phi_2^\\dagger \\phi_1 ) \\big ] + \\lambda_5 \\big [ \\text{re}(\\phi_1^\\dagger \\phi_2 ) - v_1 v_2\\big]^2 + \\lambda_6 \\big [ \\text{im}(\\phi_1^\\dagger \\phi_2)\\big]^2 \\ ; , \\label{2hdm - higgs - pot}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with two real parameters with mass dimension one ( @xmath18 ) and 6 dimensionless real parameters ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "this potential has its minimum at @xmath20 .",
    "re - expressing the fields such that the new degrees of freedom vanish at the minimum and diagonalizing the resulting bilinear scalar interaction terms one obtains a separation of the physical and unphysical spectrum of the model .",
    "the physical spectrum of the higgs sector of the cp - conserving thdm consists of 3 neutral higgs bosons , 2 cp - even ( @xmath21 ) and one cp - odd ( @xmath22 ) , and two charged ones ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the 8 free parameters of the higgs sector can also be chosen to be the modulus of the vacuum expectation value @xmath24 , the masses of the higgs bosons , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the mixing angles @xmath27 and @xmath28 used in the diagonalization of the higgs boson propagator matrices , and @xmath29 . the discrete symmetry of the higgs potential ( e.g. @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) is broken by a mass - dimension two term proportional to @xmath32 .",
