    "extrasolar planets are currently detected via indirect methods .",
    "the radial velocity technique has proved most successful in recent years .",
    "however , photometric measurements of planets transiting in front of their central star through the line - of - sight to earth have already provided more than 30 planet detections in the past years .",
    "many more transiting planet detections are expected in the very near future by the space missions corot @xcite and kepler @xcite . combining both methods allows the derivation of planetary radii , true masses and thus , the mean density of extrasolar planets .",
    "transiting planets are therefore of particular importance to investigate basic planetary parameters .",
    "the detection of extrasolar planets via the transit method requires long duration , high photometric quality lightcurves of a large number of stars .",
    "the major difficulties for ground - based transit searches are interruptions of the time series , e.g. due to the diurnal cycle or weather conditions , and the earth s atmosphere limiting the photometric signal - to - noise - ratio @xcite . located on the antarctic plateau at @xmath0 southern latitude ,",
    "provides the potential for long , uninterrupted high - quality photometric time series observations from ground during its winter period .",
    "the maximum number of astronomical nights at in comparison to mauna kea has already been calculated by @xcite , including the influence of the sun , the moon and cloud coverage .",
    "while has less astronomical nighttime , the percentage of cloud free observing hours is similar to mauna kea .",
    "kenyon & storey do not discuss optimizations for long time series observations of target fields .",
    "their paper , however , presents a detailed discussion of the expected sky brightness at .",
    "they estimate that atmospheric scattering should be exceptionally low , and even the sky brightness due to the moon should be reduced .",
    "has reduced zodiacal light , no light pollution and only minor disturbances due to aurora .",
    "furthermore , scintillation noise as a major limiting factor of photometric quality is expected to be about 3.6 times lower at dome c compared to chilean sites for long integrations @xcite , which is particularily important for the search of small planets . may therefore be the best site on earth for stable high - accuracy photometry .",
    "alternatively , networks distributed favorably in longitude can also provide high duty cycles .",
    "a well known example is the global oscillation network group ( gong ) for asteroseismological studies which include six network sites ( four in the northern and two in the southern hemisphere ) .",
    "an estimate of the expected duty cycle for spectroscopic asteroseismology from in comparison to gong has been presented by @xcite .",
    "they conclude that provides a better or similar performance than gong for observing periods up to 100 days , attaining a duty cycle of up to 87% .",
    "the network performs better for observing periods of half a year or more , but with a duty cycle of only about 77% .    in this paper",
    ", we include the factors already investigated by mosser & aristidi , like the sun and cloud coverage .",
    "in addition we include the moon and the varying extinction of the target fields during observations .",
    "furthermore , we discuss not only a comparison of to low - latitude networks , but also a combination of with other sites . a comparison between and the corot mission has already been presented @xcite .",
    "the resulting potentials for long - duration time - series photometric observations are then discussed in the context of maximizing the probability to detect extrasolar photometric transits .",
    "observations from the ground are limited for various reasons .",
    "the main restriction is imposed by the sun for observations in the visible spectral range .",
    "dark time can be reduced further by periods of full moon , because during such periods the sky background noise level reduces the photometric accuracy .",
    "selected target fields move across the sky , rising and setting and thus further limiting any observation campaign from a single site . after a brief discussion of the underlying time - frame in  [ period ] , the actual determination of observation times from these astronomical constraints will be the subject of section  [ geometricalconstraints ] . in practice ,",
    "local weather might likewise limit observations , e.g. due to cloud coverage . section  [ clouds ] describes the model used for simulating this effect .",
    "finally , the total observing time on a chosen target field as well as the photometric quality obtained crucially depend on its coordinates . in  [ targetoptimization ]",
    "we therefore present a simple model designed to provide a quantitative solution to the target field selection process .",
    "the selected time - frame for our simulation limits possible observations to a certain period and therefore affects the results systematically .",
    "the most appropriate choice is to consider a one year period for each site studied , as the earth s orbit around the sun has the most important impact on observability .",
    "after one year has elapsed , time intervals of possible observations would basically show again the same pattern for any given target field .",
    "the results presented here correspond to one year ( @xmath1 ) , starting on 1 march 2008 , 0:00h ut .    furthermore , only one field is considered per site to determine the maximum possible time coverage for planet detections .",
    "thus , planet detections at large orbital distance was given highest priority , rather than optimizing for detections of very short - period planets by maximizing the number of fields .",
    "the sun and moon affect the background noise level depending on their position relative to the observer . in order to decide whether a target is observable at a certain time or",
    "not , some criteria are needed .",
    "the most common and efficient way is to limit the three local altitudes @xmath2 , i.e. to apply @xmath3    for example @xmath4 calculates observation times without direct sun- or moonlight , as they would be restricted to stay always below the horizon .",
    "however , since scattered light might likewise disturb observations significantly , the common limit @xmath5 was used in this work , at which the contamination of the photometry is negligible .",
    "furthermore , target fields below @xmath6 altitude are not considered observable due to their poor photometric quality , i.e. @xmath7 .    moreover , the moon s contribution to sky brightness is a function of its phase @xmath8 .",
    "therefore the moon criteria in eq .",
    "( [ limit_h ] ) was relaxed by additionally allowing for situations corresponding to @xmath9 i.e. times when the moon altitude is above its limit , but the corresponding phase stays below a specified parameter @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , the distance between moon and target field can be restricted to stay above a certain value , that is @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the angle between moon and target on their great circle .",
    "based on our observational experience , these last two limits were chosen to be @xmath13 and @xmath14 at which the influence on photometric accuracy starts to be significant .    compared to low - latitude sites",
    ", the sky background is expected to be darker at dome c for the same local positions of sun , moon and target due to the low aerosol content of the air @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we refrained from adjusting the limits as this effect is still to be examined more quantitatively .",
    "the average cloud pattern at a given site was simulated using a model by @xcite , which requires two input parameters , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , derived from weather statistics .",
    "@xmath15 stands for the average fraction of clear skies , whereas @xmath16 denotes the mean duration of cloudless periods .",
    "both can vary seasonally .    according to the model",
    ", a simple pattern is created that consists of periods that either allow observations ( clear sky ) or not ( clouds ) for any given site and season .",
    "the duration of a _ single _ cloudless period is governed by a gamma distribution of the form @xmath17 so that @xmath18 denotes the probability to find an uninterrupted interval of length @xmath19 . in order to meet the given fraction @xmath15 of clear sky ,",
    "the mean duration of cloudy periods is then clearly given by @xmath20 .",
    "substituting this value for @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ clouds_p(t ) ] ) , one obtains the corresponding probability distribution of cloudy weather .",
    "an alternating sequence of clear and cloudy periods will therefore provide an approximation of real sky coverage .",
    "so , periods of potential observations ( calculated using the geometrical constraints ) are further reduced by only selecting clear sky times .",
    "as these are based upon random processes , 500 monte carlo runs are performed for each configuration in order to achieve statistically significant results .      for the purpose of site comparisons , the calculation of observational time series",
    "is often derived from astronomical night times only , i.e. without including a specific target field .",
    "these results form an upper limit on the duty cycle , but are usually not achieved by any _ single _ target .",
    "for instance , most fields can only be observed for a fraction of a year due to the earth s annual motion around the sun .",
    "however , the outcome of transit search programmes largely relies on how much time a chosen field is being observed . in particular , only long time - series might provide a sufficient detection rate for planets with earth - like orbits . including target field coordinates into the simulation is therefore necessary for an accurate analysis of duty cycles .",
    "to select optimized target field coordinates , we posed the question : for a given site and time interval , which target field will provide the longest time coverage ?",
    "two parameters are relevant here :    * observation time @xmath21 * mean airmass @xmath22    considering the observation time , fields observable over long periods are favoured .",
    "however , the photometric quality is reduced with increasing airmasses .",
    "therefore our calculations seek to minimize the mean airmass .    for that",
    ", both parameters are calculated as a function of potential equatorial target coordinates @xmath23 throughout the whole sky for each site . in order to optimize them simultanously",
    ", they must subsequently be weighted against each other by defining a function @xmath24 .",
    "using such a weighting mechanism then provides a sky map from which we can easily derive a maximum value .",
    "although the choice of a specific function @xmath25 is somewhat arbitrary , it should in general show a reasonable dependency on its two variables @xmath21 and @xmath22 : firstly , @xmath25 should be monotonically decreasing in @xmath22 , as the photometric quality can only be reduced with larger airmasses .",
    "secondly , only a linear dependency on the observing time @xmath21 is meaningful . finally , we have already excluded target fields with airmasses @xmath26 by setting @xmath27 , thus it is consequent to demand @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "these requirements are well fulfilled by the following approach : @xmath30 the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 have been chosen to reproduce the dependency of photometric accuracy on the airmass of observations , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : am_weighting ] : in the region @xmath33 we get @xmath34 , which accounts for the usually negligible variation of the signal - to - noise ratio of photometric data recorded at these airmasses . beyond that the photometric quality is significantly reduced , resulting in a strong devaluation of observing times with an average airmass close to 2 .",
    "this procedure yields an efficient choice of target coordinates for site networks .",
    "we then maximized the total time of observation from at least one site and decided to observe from whichever site provided the smallest airmass whenever simultaneous observations were possible .",
    "target coordinates found by this procedure obviously take into account astronomical configurations only .",
    "additional factors are required to optimize the field for an exoplanet transit search programme .",
    "in particular , the target field must contain a large number of dwarf stars .",
    "the required high number has to be weighted against crowding effects in dense star fields .",
    "therefore , this optimization step depends on the fov and the spatial scale of the instrument chosen .",
    "it has to be performed for a particular instrument and is therefore not within the scope of this paper which concentrates on the astronomical boundary conditions in terms of optimized duty cycle .",
    "as already mentioned , we aim to compare the window function obtained from antarctica with one or more low - latitude sites as well as a combination of with such locations .",
    "in addition to , three sites with similar low - latitudes are considered for a potential southern hemisphere network .",
    "the location of the best ii telescope ( erikson _ et al .",
    "_ , in prep . ) at cerro armazones",
    "was chosen in chile .",
    "in africa a site next to the gamsberg in namibia was included in our calculations , whereas the anglo - australian observatory ( aao ) was selected on the australian continent .",
    "the geographical coordinates are listed in table [ localcoordinates ] .",
    ".local coordinates of considered sites [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      the two parameters used by the weather model , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , can exhibit strong seasonal and geographical variability . for the simulation of free - sky windows , monthly mean values are used for each site in table [ localcoordinates ] .",
    "figure [ fig : weather_compare ] shows the dependency of the assumed average clear sky fraction @xmath15 on time and location . for , winter observations from @xcite with mean values of 6.8 consecutive clear days and 84% overall clear skies were extrapolated to the whole year . in the case of chile ,",
    "cloudiness data from the european southern observatory ( eso ) paranal were averaged for 1983 - 2006 , whereas publicly available _ surface synoptic observations _ ( synop ) from 2004 - 2007 were used for the aao . finally , an eso site survey provided values for @xmath15 at close - by gamsberg in namibia @xcite .    for australia ,",
    "the average duration of clear periods in the data set was found to be @xmath35 .",
    "for chile and namibia we assumed @xmath36 according to @xcite .",
    "however , the parameter @xmath16 only affects the duration of individual observations and is thus of minor importance .",
    "for example , using values @xmath37 for chile does neither change the total observation time @xmath21 nor the time coverage of planetary transits .",
    "we first validated the model against previous studies . calculated celestial coordinates",
    "agree with results from the publicly available _ _ jpl horizons _ _ ephemeris software to within 30 arcseconds for the years 1900 - 2100 .",
    "in addition to this , the results of @xcite for available dark time at and mauna kea were confirmed when we adopted their slightly differing limits for sun- and moonlight .",
    "then , optimal target fields have been simulated for all single sites as well as for three possible combinations of the sites .",
    "the various configurations are summarized in table [ tab : results ] .      as a first step , we investigated the limitations imposed on time - series observations by each of the constraining factors considered individually .",
    "figure [ fig : effects ] shows calculated values of @xmath21 taking into account firstly only sunlight , then gradually including moonlight , target field visibility and finally cloud coverage .    at a single site like best ii",
    ", the maximum dark time is 163 days per year due to the diurnal cycle ( @xmath38 , dark bars in fig .",
    "[ fig : effects ] ) . at , the dark time per year is somewhat less ( 135 days ) due to its high latitude . on the contrary ,",
    "a low - latitude network can in principle observe all year round .",
    "however , effects like moonlight , target field selection and clouds further reduce the maximum available observing time .    the target field selection does not impose a strong restriction on available observing time from , because many fields are above @xmath39 almost continuously during the polar night . at low latitude sites , the full available dark time",
    "can only be filled with observations of several target fields over the year . for one field",
    "it is , of course , significantly reduced ( compare third bars from left for each site in fig .",
    "[ fig : effects ] ) .",
    "in addition , there are also severe effects by clouds and the final performance is therefore significantly reduced in comparison to the ideal case ( fourth bar ) . due to the unequal impact of limitations upon different sites",
    "it is therefore necessary to consider all four effects simultaneously .",

    "the efficiency of transit detection is examined .",
    "figure [ fig : cov3_cld ] shows a comparison of observational coverage based on the simulated window functions .",
    "simulations have been performed as a function of the orbital period and for three or more transit events , which is usually the minimum requirement for detection .",
    "that is , a coverage of 100% means at least three events of a potential transiting planet will be observed for a given orbital distance .",
    "note that we only take into account the time sampling here , so the actual detection probabilities will be reduced further e.g. by the signal - to - noise ratio or geometric orientation .",
    "all curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : cov3_cld ] show peaks and dips caused by interruptions in the data sampling e.g. due to the diurnal cycle , full moon or cloud coverage .",
    "periodic data gaps lead to a reduced observational coverage for orbital periods which are multiple of interruption frequencies .    can provide continuous observational coverage for planets with up to about two weeks orbital period , extending to 30 days with a probability of 50% .",
    "in contrast to that , it is very unlikely to detect planets with periods significantly longer than 15 days for a single low - latitude site like best ii in chile within one year .",
    "however , an almost equal performance to could be achieved by the combination of three low - latitude sites .    combining a telescope at with one in chile",
    "extends the full observational coverage to about three weeks and leads to a significantly improved performance for larger periods compared to alone .",
    "finally , the combination of with a network including chile , namibia and australia could , in addition to a good coverage of small orbits , in principle still detect planets with periods of more than 60 days at a reasonable coverage .",
    "we have investigated the prospects for long - duration uninterrupted photometric time series from and other low - latitude sites .",

    "furthermore , the effective observing time period can be extended if is combined with other sites which can provide data during the summer period .",
    "for example , the combination of with a site in chile extends the observational coverage significantly .",
    "combining with a low - latitude network of sites at chile , namibia and australia provides prospects for observational duty cycles that can be improved upon only by observations from space .",
    "to predict quantitative transit detection rates , the photometric quality of must be investigated directly .",
