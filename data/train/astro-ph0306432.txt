    "the multi - frequency data were dedispersed at a set of 163 trial dm values between 0 and 200  @xmath7  pc .",
    "each dedispersed time series was fourier transformed , and the strongest periodic components were recorded . in order to increase sensitivity to signals with a small duty cycle , harmonically related components ( at @xmath8 , 2@xmath8 , ... , @xmath9 ; with @xmath10 , 4 , 8 and 16 ) were summed , and again the strongest peaks were recorded .",
    "the power spectrum was also searched for harmonics up to @xmath11 of frequency above nyquist that might have been aliased back into the power spectrum , in an attempt to improve our sensitivity to millisecond pulsars .",

    "the dm at which the sensitivity is degraded by half for a 5  ms pulsar is about 150  @xmath7  pc . if we find a pulsar with this dm in the direction of our survey for which the electron densities are larger ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 )",

    "the effect depends mainly on galactic latitude ( @xmath2 ) . to summarize",

    "a consequence of this is that the @xmath29 has not yet been conclusively measured . for some of the more recent measurements of this pulsar ,",
    "we have also used the l - narrow receiver at a central frequency of 1410 mhz , and the wide - band arecibo pulsar processor correlator ( wapp ) as a back - end with a total bandwidth of 100 mhz .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio obtained is similar to that of the 430-mhz observations .",
    "the newly confirmed pulsars psr  j1756 + 18 and psr  j2050 + 13 also lack timing solutions , and they are now being timed at a frequency of 327 mhz .",
    "these three pulsars are listed in table [ tab : parameters1 ] .",
    "the remaining 5 pulsars timed since 1997 have phase - coherent timing solutions , which are presented in table  [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "these were obtained and refined using the tempo timing program .",
    "their timing parameters are typical of the `` normal '' pulsar population ; the characteristic ages vary from 7 to 300 myr .",
    "the residuals of the toas can be seen in figure [ fig : residuals ] . for one of the two pulsars discovered independently at parkes , psr  j1819 + 1305 ( edwards et al .",
    "2001 ) , the timing parameters obtained at the two sites can be compared for the same reference epoch ( table  [ tab : parameters ] ) .",
    "the other pulsar that was also found at parkes ( psr  j1837 + 1221 ) has not been timed at arecibo .      a direct comparison can be made between the ils and the 1400-mhz swinburne intermediate latitude survey ( henceforth sils ) , which was made using the parkes 64-m radio telescope s multi - beam system ( edwards et al .",
    "the sils target area was defined by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , so there is some overlap with the area covered by the ils .    in this overlap area , both surveys detected psr  j1819 + 1305 and psr  j1837 + 1221 .",
    "the sils did not detect our two other discoveries in the common search area , psr  j1814 + 1130 and psr  j1828 + 1359 .",
    "although we are dealing with small number statistics , this result shows that the ils has achieved a greater sensitivity to normal pulsars in the intermediate galactic latitudes , as expected from fig .",
    "[ fig : sens ] .",
    "the sils detected a total of 170 pulsars ( 69 of which were new discoveries ) in a search area 23 times larger than that of the ils ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "this represents one detection per @xmath33 , which , as expected , is not as high as the detection density of the ils .",
    "however , the sils covered regions closer to the galactic center and also at a slightly lower latitude range ( @xmath34 ) , two factors that increased that survey s detection rate .",
    "the number of normal pulsars detected by the swinburne survey was not enhanced by the higher frequencies used .",
    "the pulsar with the highest dm detected by the sils , psr  b1620@xmath3542 , has a rotational period of 0.365 seconds and a dm of 295  @xmath7  pc .",
    "figure [ fig : sens ] shows that such a pulsar would not have been missed by the ils because of pulse smearing .",
    "therefore , for the sensitivity of the sils , observing at 1400 mhz does not improve the detectability of slow pulsars for the galactic latitudes sampled .",
    "this is acknowledged by edwards  et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who find that the dm distribution of their slow pulsar discoveries is similar to that of their re - detected pulsars , which with almost no exception were found at lower frequencies .",
    "we can therefore conclude that , as expected , our survey is purely sensitivity - limited for this class of pulsars .",
    "the situation changes for msps at similar dms ; where the sils is still capable of making detections , unlike any 430-mhz survey ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sens ] ) .",
    "the sils has detected twelve recycled objects , eight of them new ( edwards & bailes 2001 ) , with dms between 26 and 117  @xmath7  pc .",
    "[ fig : sens ] shows that our survey could in principle detect such objects .",
    "one consequence of this is that the fraction of recycled pulsars detected by the sils ( one in 14 ) is remarkably similar to ours ( one in 13 ) , even when our survey finds twice as many normal and recycled pulsars per square degree .",
    "because of small number statistics , the recycled pulsar fractions would still be consistent had we found one more or one less recycled object .    a more recent arecibo 430-mhz survey of the galactic plane ( nice , fruchter , & taylor 1995 ) has covered a region of the sky twice as large ( 260@xmath36 , with @xmath37 ) with a sensitivity very similar to that of the ils .",
    "it detected 61 pulsars , of which 4 are recycled .",
    "this represents more than twice the detection density of the ils survey , which is due to the larger concentration of pulsars along the galactic plane , yet the fraction of detections of recycled pulsars ( one in 15 ) is remarkably similar to that of the ils and the sils .",
    "it is , however , true that the fraction of recycled objects does increase for the higher galactic latitudes .",
    "psr  j1819 + 1305 is by far the most luminous pulsar discovered in this survey .",
    "its pulse profile consists of three components ; the relative intensities of these are observed to vary systematically from one 3-minute sub - integration to the next . using single - pulse data obtained in december 2002 , we found that the main cause of this variation is the strong intensity modulation of the first component of the pulse profile .",
    "these single - pulse data also showed that there is further intensity modulation affecting the whole pulse profile , this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulses ] .",
    "most of this is due to nulling , with emission absent for about 50% of the time .",
    "this nulling has the peculiarity of having a very marked periodicity at 53@xmath383 rotations , which is both well defined , long and with a large nulling fraction compared to other pulsars known to exhibit periodic nulling ( rankin 1986 ) .",
    "the emission of this pulsar , by its combination of peculiar characteristics , deserves a more careful study .",
    "in particular , it will be interesting to determine its polarization characteristics , which might allow a good estimate of the angle between the magnetic and rotation axis and of the latter relative to the line of sight .",
    "this will be essential for a proper interpretation of the nulling , and might lead to new insights about the emission mechanism of pulsars .",
    "perhaps the most important result of this work is the discovery of the 65-ms pulsar psr  j2016 + 1948 .",
    "this is a member of a binary system , together with a 0.29 m@xmath39 white dwarf companion ( assuming a pulsar mass of 1.35  m@xmath39 and an inclination of 90@xmath40 ) .",
    "the orbital period is 635 days .",
    "psr  j2016 + 1948 is the second most luminous pulsar discovered in the ils , with @xmath41mjy  kpc@xmath42 .    for this binary system ,",
    "we have not yet determined a phase - coherent timing solution for the whole data set .",
    "the position in the sky was determined with a set of 1400-mhz pointings at the source s nominal position and half a beam width ( one beam width is 3 arcmin at arecibo ) north , south , east and west of the nominal position . a position can be determined from the intensity of the pulsed signal of the detections , with an uncertainty that is a small fraction of the beam size .",
    "this procedure is known as `` gridding '' ( morris et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the remaining parameters for this pulsar were determined from the observed barycentric periods . technically , this was achieved with toa information : we have used tempo to fit for the orbital parameters and rotational period with a different time offset for each day s toa set .",
    "each of these sets gives an independent estimate of the barycentric rotation period for its day .",
    "the orbital model used was the ell1 ( lange et al .",
    "2001 ) , which was specially designed for low - eccentricity systems like psr  j2016 + 1948 , where no precise estimates of the longitude of periastron ( and therefore , of the time of passage through periastron ) can be made .",
    "we have used a bootstrap monte carlo method ( efron & tibshirani 1993 ) to estimate the 1-@xmath28 orbital parameter uncertainties that appear in table [ tab : parameters1 ] .    psr  j2016 + 1948",
    "has the third longest orbital period known for this type of system ; the longest are those of psr  b0820 + 02 , for which @xmath431232 days ( arzoumanian 1995 ) and psr  j0407 + 16 ( @xmath43669 days , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , lorimer 2003 , private communication ) . with a rotational period of 0.86  s , psr  b0820",
    "+ 02 has not been significantly recycled by interaction with the progenitor of the companion white dwarf .",
    "the much shorter rotational periods of psr  j2016 + 1948 ( 65 ms ) and of psr  j0407 + 16 ( 25 ms ) , and the low upper limit for the period derivative of the latter pulsar are suggestive of extensive recycling .",
    "the determination of the orbital eccentricities for these systems is important in its own right .",
    "the theories that describe the recycling of neutron stars into msps ( alpar et al 1982 , zahn 1977 , phinney 1992 ) predict the order of magnitude of the orbital eccentricity as a function of the orbital period . for @xmath43600700 days , the eccentricity should be of the order of 10@xmath46 ( phinney 1992 ) .",
    "the values derived for the psr  j2016 + 1948 and psr  j0407 + 16 binary systems are in excellent agreement with that prediction .",
    "pulsars have been used in several different ways for testing the fundamental properties of gravitation ( esposito - farse 1999 , bell 1999 ) .",
    "one of the most fundamental and distinctive properties of general relativity ( gr ) is the strong equivalence principle ( sep ) . like the weak equivalence principle ( wep ) , which led einstein to elaborate gr",
    ", it requires the universality of free fall : acceleration of any object in an external gravitational field is independent of the size or chemical composition of the object .",
    "however , sep also requires the same accelerations under external fields for objects that have significantly different gravitational binding energies ( will 1993 ) .",
    "all theories of gravitation that describe gravity as a distortion of space - time ; the so - called metric theories of gravitation ( will 1993 ) , `` predict '' wep by design .",
    "this is not the case for sep , which is a feature peculiar to gr . if the assumption of sep is wrong , as postulated in many alternative theories of gravitation , i.e. , if @xmath47 ( where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the inertial and gravitational masses of an object , @xmath50 is the nordtvedt parameter which measures deviations from sep , @xmath51 is the object s self - gravitational energy and @xmath52 is the velocity of light ) then the accelerations in the same external field of two objects will not be exactly equal because of the different gravitational binding energies .",
    "this difference in acceleration causes a `` polarization '' of the binary , which is an increase in the eccentricity of the system along the direction of the external field known as the `` nordtvedt effect '' ( nordtvedt 1968a ) .",
    "such an effect has not been found in the weak fields probed by solar system experiments , in particular the lunar laser ranging ( nordtvedt 1968b ) .",
    "this experiment determined that , despite the differences in gravitational self - energy between the earth and the moon , these two objects fall at the same rate ( to within one part in 10@xmath53 ) in the gravitational field of the sun ( williams , newhall , & dickey 1996 ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath54 , which is entirely consistent with gr .",
    "however , damour and esposito - farse ( 1992 ) have shown that , generally ,    @xmath55    where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the weak and strong field components of the nordtvedt parameter @xmath50 and the @xmath58 are the compactness of the bodies involved :    @xmath59    is there a strong - field component of @xmath50 ?",
    "if so , gr is not the right description of gravitation .",
    "such a test can not be conducted in the solar system , where no strong fields are to be found .    a pulsar- white dwarf system , with the galaxy generating the external field , provides the ideal laboratory to make such a measurement .",
    "pulsars have very large gravitational binding energies of about @xmath3515% of the total mass ( i.e. , @xmath60 , the exact number depends on the equation of state for cold matter at high densities and the mass of the pulsar ) .",
    "the white dwarf companion has , comparatively , a negligible gravitational binding energy , about 10@xmath61 times smaller than that of the neutron star .",
    "if there is any strong - field component of the acceleration , it should be felt just by the pulsar , hence the difference in acceleration compared to the white dwarf and the associated nordtvedt effect",
    ".    the figure - of - merit of a binary system for a nordtvedt test is @xmath62 ( arzoumanian 1995 ) .",
    "however , wex ( 1997 ) has shown that for an unambiguous interpretation of the low eccentricity of a binary system , the system s age has to be significantly larger than one galactic orbit .    among all the known binaries with previously published timing solutions ,",
    "the @xmath62 number is highest for the psr  b1800@xmath3527 system .",
    "the eccentricity of this system can not be interpreted unambiguously because of the pulsar s age ( @xmath63300 myr ) is of the order of a single galactic orbit . of all such binaries that pass the large @xmath20 criterion , psr  j1713 + 0747 , with @xmath64gyr ( camilo ,",
    "foster , & wolszczan 1994 ) , is the system for which @xmath62 is largest : 6.14@xmath65  days@xmath42 . for psr  j2016 + 1948 and psr  j0407 + 16 , the @xmath62 is @xmath66  days@xmath42 and @xmath67  days@xmath42 , or factors of @xmath684 - 5 and 7 - 8 times larger than for psr  j1713 + 0747 .    using all the binary systems that pass the large age criterion ,",
    "a value of @xmath69 was obtained ( wex 1997 ) .",
    "assuming again that the pulsar s compactness is 0.15 , this implies @xmath70 .",
    "the inclusion of psr  j2016 + 1948 and psr  j0407 + 16 in that ensemble of binary systems will significantly reduce the upper limits on @xmath71 and @xmath50 .",
    "an interesting aspect of these limits is that they will diminish with the mere addition of binary systems with high @xmath62 to the ensemble being used ( wex 1997 ) .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath71 has been used , together with the measurements of orbital decay for the psr  b1913 + 16 binary system , to impose fundamental constraints to any alternative theories of gravitation , in particular the tensor bi - scalar theories ( damour & esposito - farse 1992 , esposito - farse 1999 ) .",
    "these constraints will become significantly more stringent with the inclusion of systems like psr  j2016 + 1948 and psr  j0407 + 16 .",
    "however , we must keep in mind that the determination of the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass , particularly when very large self - gravitational energies are involved , is an important measurement in itself , with a significance wider than the tests it introduces to any particular gravitational theory .",
    "it will forever remain as a fundamental constraint to our understanding of gravitation .",
    "we have found nine new pulsars in a small arecibo 430-mhz survey of the intermediate galactic latitudes . we have timed six of these , with five now having phase - coherent timing solutions .",
    "these are old , normal pulsars ; a population similar to that of the earlier hulse - taylor survey . as expected , there are no young pulsars among the sample that has been timed .",
    "we compare this survey with the sils ( edwards et al .",
    "2001 ) and conclude that we have reached greater sensitivity to this population of normal pulsars .",
    "two of the discoveries , psr  j1819 + 1305 and psr  j1837 + 1221 , were independently found at parkes by the sils and then timed .",
    "we found that the former pulsar has strong variation of its integrated pulse profiles .",
    "this is partly due to nulling ; the nulls exhibit a very strong periodicity at 53@xmath383 rotations .    because of small number statistics , it is impossible to obtain any firm conclusions , based on our survey alone , as to the number of recycled pulsars to be discovered at the intermediate galactic latitudes at 430  mhz .",
    "we found a single pulsar that is likely to be recycled , psr  j2016 + 1948 , out of a total of 13 detections , a proportion similar to what was obtained by 430-mhz surveys of the galactic plane .",
    "however , a much larger 430-mhz ils survey would certainly not find a larger fraction of recycled pulsars than the sils at 1400 mhz ( which is also one in 14 ) .",
    "therefore , our initial expectation , and also that of cordes and chernoff ( 1997 ) , that for the latitudes near @xmath72 there are many recycled pulsars to be found ( this being the main motivation of the present survey ) can not be confirmed by the ils and sils .",
    "this might imply that the scale height for recycled pulsars is larger than the value that was assumed in the previous calculations , 0.65 kpc .",
    "psr  j2016 + 1947 has a rotational period of 64.9 ms and it forms a binary system with an @xmath680.3  m@xmath39 white dwarf companion .",
    "this system has an orbital period of 635 days , with an orbital eccentricity of about 0.0012 . the more precise determination of the orbital parameters of this binary will , together with the timing of another binary pulsar , psr  j0407 + 16 , lead to much tighter constraints on any violation of the strong equivalence principle .",

    "<S> they present a large dispersive smearing across each of the channels of the back - ends used to carry out the surveys . </S>",

    "<S> the distance at which a given dm is reached is much smaller than along lines - of - sight at higher latitudes , this means that the volume within which msps can be detected at 430 mhz is much smaller ( both compared to normal pulsars , and per square degree , henceforth indicated as @xmath1 ) for the low galactic latitudes . </S>",

    "<S> our aim was to test the expectation that many msps remain to be discovered in these intermediate galactic latitudes . </S>",
    "<S> some of the results of this intermediate latitude survey ( ils ) are presented in this work . </S>",
    "<S> the timing solutions for psr  j1756 + 18 , psr  j2050 + 13 and psr  j2016 + 1947 , and a detailed study of the latter pulsar will be presented elsewhere . </S>"
