    "recently quantum computation and quantum communication have attracted much attention , because the use of quantum mechanical phenomena can offer unusual efficiency in computation and communication .",
    "we have to protect quantum states from environmental noise in quantum computation and some methods in quantum communication , such as the quantum superdense coding @xcite . the quantum error - correcting codes ( or quantum codes ) independently proposed by shor @xcite and",
    "steane @xcite is one of techniques for protecting quantum states .",
    "recently it was recognized that construction of quantum codes is connected with the problem of finding a linear space over a finite field with certain properties ( see theorem [ th1 ] ) . in this paper",
    "we propose a method of constructing such linear spaces from an algebraic curve .",
    "let us explain quantum codes and their connection with linear spaces over finite fields .",
    "we begin with the notion of @xmath0-error correction .",
    "let @xmath1 be a @xmath2-dimensional complex linear space , where @xmath2 is a prime power , and suppose that @xmath1 represents a physical system of interest .",
    "a quantum code @xmath3 is a @xmath4-dimensional subspace of @xmath5 .",
    "when we want to protect a quantum state in @xmath6 , we encode @xmath7 into a state in @xmath3 .",
    "so we encode a quantum state of @xmath8 particles into that of @xmath9 particles .",
    "suppose that we send @xmath10 and receive @xmath11 .",
    "a quantum code @xmath3 is said to be _ @xmath0-error - correcting _ if we can decode @xmath7 from @xmath12 provided that at least the states of @xmath13 particles in @xmath12 are left unchanged from @xmath7 .    since",
    "a change of a quantum state is continuous , the notion of @xmath0-error correction seems nonsense at first glance @xcite .",
    "this notion can be justified as follows : in general the decoding process of a quantum code does not decode perfectly the transmitted quantum state from a received one .",
    "however , the decoded state and a transmitted state become closer as @xmath0 increases provided that the quantum channel used is memoryless as a @xmath2-ary channel ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7.4 ) , @xcite . a quantitative relation between the closeness of states",
    ", the noisiness of a channel , and @xmath0 can be found in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that one can make the decoded state arbitrary close to the transmitted state by increasing the code length provided that the ratio @xmath14 is fixed and is sufficiently large compared with the noisiness of the channel .",
    "this is a major motivation for studying long codes as in the classical coding theory ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.3 ) .",
    "when the code length is small , we can find good quantum codes by examining all possible codes by a computer .",
    "however , when the code length is large , we need some systematic construction method for producing good quantum codes . in this paper",
    "we propose such a method .",
    "we are now able to state the connection between quantum codes and finite fields , which is obtained for the binary code ( @xmath15 ) by calderbank et  al .",

    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 ,  , @xmath20 we define the standard symplectic form ( or alternating form ) by @xmath21 a linear space with a nondegenerate symplectic form is called a symplectic space . for a vector @xmath22 define the weight of @xmath23 by @xmath24 for a subspace @xmath25 we define @xmath26 that is , the orthogonal space of @xmath27 with respect to ( [ symplectic ] ) .

    "the nonbinary generalization is due to knill @xcite and rains @xcite .",
    "the stabilizer code is the most general algebraic construction of quantum codes proposed so far .",
    "the value @xmath33 is called the _ minimum distance _ of a stabilizer code . a stabilizer code with minimum distance @xmath34 encoding @xmath8 particles into @xmath9 particles is called an @xmath35 $ ] code",

    "so we restrict ourselves to stabilizer codes for quantum systems of prime power dimension .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we propose a construction method of quantum stabilizer codes from algebraic curves and discuss decoding process of the constructed codes . in section [ sec31 ]",
    "we construct an asymptotically good sequence of quantum codes as an example of the proposed construction method . in section [ sec32 ]",
    "we improved the construction of asymptotically good sequence in @xcite as a byproduct of the construction in section [ sec31 ] , and compare the sequences in section [ sec3 ] with the known asymptotically good sequences @xcite in figure [ fig1 ] .",
