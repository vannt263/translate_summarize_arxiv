    "multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) technology holds the key to very high throughput downlink communication in fading wireless channels by exploiting the spatial dimension @xcite .",
    "however most modern mimo wireless communication standards support a maximum achievable spectral efficiency of around @xmath3 bits / sec / hz . this is partly due to the use of sub - optimal orthogonal multiple access schemes like tdma and fdma .",
    "the capacity region and sum capacity of the gaussian mimo broadcast channel ( which models downlink communication in modern wireless systems ) is achieved by a scheme called dirty paper coding ( dpc ) , in which all users share the same frequency - time resource @xcite .",
    "it is also known that orthogonal access schemes ( like tdma , fdma ) are strictly sub - optimal and achieve only a small fraction of the total sum capacity @xcite .",
    "however , tdma and fdma are still favored in practice due to the high precoding complexity of optimal precoders like dpc . apart from dpc",
    ", other near - optimal precoders like those based on vector perturbation and lattice reduction @xcite also have prohibitive complexity .",
    "on the other hand low complexity precoders , like zf @xcite , mmse are known to achieve poor sum rate performance especially in ill - conditioned channels .    to keep the low - complexity benefit of the zf precoder and yet improve the overall sum rate ( specially when",
    "the channel is ill - conditioned ) , we propose a user grouping based precoder . in the proposed precoder ,",
    "the users are divided into _ small _ groups of equal size .",
    "downlink beamforming is done in such a way that , at each receiver the interference from the signal intended for users not in its group is nulled out .",
    "however , there still remains interference from the signal of users in the same group .",
    "this interference is pre - cancelled at the transmitter , by performing dirty paper coding among the users in the same group . with small groups ( e.g. , having only two users ) , dirty paper coding within each group",
    "is _ practically _ feasible @xcite .",
    "note that the proposed user grouping method is fundamentally different from user selection .",
    "user selection schemes select a subset of users to be scheduled @xcite .",
    "the base station ( bs ) then precodes information only to these selected users .",
    "the proposed user grouping precoder is a method for precoding of information to the selected users , and not for selecting which users are to be scheduled.[multiblock footnote omitted ] note that the user grouping precoder proposed by us in this paper could be used to significantly improve the overall information sum rate performance achieved by user selection methods which assume a zf precoder at the bs ( for example the user selection method proposed in @xcite ) .",
    "inter - group interference pre - cancellation for a group of users is achieved by choosing their beamforming vectors to lie in a space orthogonal to the space spanned by the channel vectors of the users in the other groups .",
    "one novel aspect of the proposed precoder is that we choose the beamforming vectors in such a way that the effective channel matrix for each group is lower triangular , which enables successive interference pre - cancellation within each group using dpc . with a group size greater than one ,",
    "the proposed precoder is analytically shown to achieve a sum rate greater than that achieved by the zf precoder . for a given grouping of users , the optimal power allocation is given by the waterfilling scheme . since the achievable sum rate of the proposed precoder is observed to be sensitive towards the chosen grouping of users , the information sum rate is jointly optimized w.r.t .",
    "both the per user power allocation as well as the grouping .",
    "this optimization problem is inherently complex , and therefore we propose a near - optimal solution to it , which we refer to as jpauga ( joint power allocation and user grouping algorithm ) .    through simulations , we show that in ill - conditioned channels the proposed precoder with jpauga user grouping achieves a sum rate significantly greater than that achieved by the zf precoder .",
    "further for the special case of user pairing ( i.e. , two users in each group ) , interference pre - cancellation needs to be performed for only one user in each group , for which practical and near - optimal performance achieving ( i.e. , close to dpc ) methods have been reported @xcite .",
    "further , with user pairing the complexity of the proposed precoder with jpauga user grouping is shown to have a complexity of @xmath2 which is the same as the complexity of the zf precoder .",
    "a special case of the proposed precoder is when there is only one group containing all the @xmath1 users .",
    "this special case has been proposed as the zf - dp precoder in @xcite .",
    "though the zf - dp precoder achieves better performance than the proposed user grouping precoder with more than one group , it has a much higher complexity .",
    "we also clarify that , the proposed precoder is _ entirely different _ from the block diagonalization based precoder proposed in @xcite , which considers a mimo broadcast channel , in which each user could have multiple receive antennas .",
    "beamforming vectors are chosen such that each user sees no interference from the information intended for other users . hence , in the special case of miso broadcast channel ( which we consider in this paper ) , the block diagonalization precoder in @xcite reduces to the zf precoder . in addition to this , the precoder that we propose performs _ beamforming in groups of users _ and not separately for each user .",

    "the zf precoder is a low complexity linear precoder where the information for each user is beamformed in a direction which is orthogonal to the space spanned by the channel vectors of the remaining @xmath72 users , thereby resulting in no inter - user interference .",
    "hence , for any given user , its effective channel gain is proportional to the euclidean length of the projection of its channel vector onto the space orthogonal to the space spanned by the channel vectors of remaining users . in case of ill - conditioned channels , since the channel vectors of all the users are `` nearly '' linearly dependent , the effective channel gain of each user would be small , implying low achievable rates .",
    "therefore it makes sense to design precoders which have a complexity similar to zf , but which can achieve a higher sum - rate than the zf precoder when the channel is ill - conditioned .    by grouping users into groups of size larger than one",
    ", beamforming can be done to nullify _ only inter - group _ interference .",
    "further , it is possible to perform beamforming in such a way that the effective @xmath73 channel matrix for each group is lower triangular . with small group size and a lower triangular effective channel matrix ,",
    "intra - group interference can be pre - cancelled using _ practical successive _ dirty paper coding ( dpc ) at the transmitter , without any significant increase in the required transmit power ( when compared to an ideal scenario where the effective channel matrix is diagonal , i.e. , no intra - group interference ) . with this precoding method ,",
    "the effective channel gain for @xmath68 would be the euclidean length of the projection of @xmath74 onto the space @xmath75 ( i.e. , user @xmath68 would see interference only from the information symbols of users @xmath76 ) .",
    "on the other hand , with the zf precoder , the effective channel gain is the euclidean length of the projection of @xmath74 onto the subspace orthogonal to all the rows of @xmath60 except @xmath74 .",
    "( we shall subsequently denote this orthogonal subspace by @xmath77 . )",
    "it is noted that @xmath78 whenever @xmath79 .",
    "since the projection of a vector onto a subspace of some space @xmath80 is of lesser euclidean length than its projection onto the space @xmath80 , it follows that the effective channel gain for @xmath68 is higher with the proposed user grouping based precoder as compared to that with the zf precoder .",
    "this simple observation coupled with the availability of practical low - complexity dpc for gaussian broadcast channels with a small number of users , motivates the proposed user grouping based precoder which is presented in section [ proposed_prec_ref ] in more detail . for a given user grouping the sum rate",
    "is maximized by the waterfilling power allocation across all the users ( the effective channel gain of each user is considered ) .",
    "the sum rate achieved by the proposed precoder is shown to be dependent on the chosen grouping of users .",
    "this is expected , as for example with two users having `` highly '' linearly dependent channel vectors , the information rate to these two users would be higher when they are placed in the same group . therefore in section [ sub_sec_partition ]",

    "the power allocation and the possible user groupings .",

    "is transformed into @xmath82 parallel @xmath47-user gaussian broadcast channels .",
    "this is presented in section [ bmf ] , where we finally show that the proposed multiuser beamforming is such that the effective channel matrix for each group is lower triangular . subsequently in section [ dpc_coding ] , using the fact that the effective channel is lower triangular we use dirty paper coding to cancel interference between the users within a group .",
    "we also show that for a fixed user grouping , the information sum rate is maximized by the waterfilling power allocation . in section [ zf_p ]",
    "we show that the zf precoder is a special case of the proposed precoder with @xmath1 groups , i.e. , @xmath83 .",
