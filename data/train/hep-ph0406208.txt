    "lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) interactions deserve to analyze since , theoretically , they are sensitive the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) and they are rich in the sense that they exist at loop level and make it possible to predict the free parameters of the underlying theory .",
    "the radiative lfv decays are among the well known candidates of the lfv processes and there are various experimental and theoretical works in the literature .",
    "the current limits for the branching ratios ( @xmath2 s ) of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays are @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath4 @xcite , respectively .",
    "the extensive theoretical work has been done on these decays in the supersymmetric models @xcite , in the framework of the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) @xcite and also in a model independent way @xcite .    in the general 2hdm , so called the model iii , the possibility of the flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc s ) at tree level allows the existence of the radiative lfv decays , theoretically .",
    "these decays are induced by the internal neutral higgs bosons @xmath5 and @xmath6 and the yukawa couplings carrying information about the strength of the lepton - lepton - neutral higgs interactions are free parameters of the theory .",
    "these free parameters should be restricted by using the experimental measurements .",
    "this work is devoted to the lfv processes @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the framework of the model iii , with the inclusion of one ( two ) non - universal extra spatial dimension .",
    "the extra dimension scenario is based on the string theories as a possible solution to the hierarchy problem of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the effects of extra dimensions on various phenomena have been studied in the literature @xcite-@xcite . for the extra dimension scenarios",
    "the starting point is a fundamental theory , lying in higher dimensions and the assumption that the four dimensional sm is its low energy effective theory .",
    "the procedure to pass from higher dimensions to the four dimension is the compactificitation of each extra dimension to a circle @xmath7 with radius @xmath8 , which is a typical size of corresponding extra dimension .",
    "finally , it leads to appear new particles , namely kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes of the particles in the theory .",
    "if all the fields feel the extra dimensions , so called universal extra dimensions ( ued ) , the extra dimensional momentum is conserved , in other words , the kk number at each vertex is not violated . in the case of a single ued , the compactification size",
    "@xmath8 has been predicted as large as few hundereds of gev @xcite , in the range @xmath9 , using electroweak precision measurements @xcite , the @xmath10 -mixing @xcite and the flavor changing process @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "if the extra dimensions are accessible to some fields but not all in the theory , they are called non - universal extra dimensions . in this case",
    ", the kk number at each vertex is not conserved and tree level interaction of kk modes with the ordinary particles can exist . in @xcite , it was observed that , a very light left handed neutrino can be obtained in the non - universal extra dimensions where only the right handed neutrino feels the extra dimension . the study in @xcite is due to the effect of brane kinetic terms for bulk scalars , fermions and gauge fields in higher dimensional theories .",
    "there are also some phenomenological studies on the non - universal extra dimensions in the literature @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we study the branching ratios ( br s ) of the lfv processes @xmath0 and @xmath12 in the model iii and we assume that the extra dimensions are felt by the new higgs doublet and the gauge sector of the theory .",
    "the compactification of the single ( double ) extra dimension to the circle ( torus ) @xmath7 ( @xmath13 ) brings new particles , kk modes of neutral higgs bosons @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and the additional vertices , inducing kk mode of neutral higgs boson - lepton - lepton interaction , appear . in this case , the kk number in the vertices is not conserved , in contrast to the universal extra dimension ( ued ) case , where all fields experience the extra dimensions .",

    "@xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the mass ( mass@xmath21)of @xmath22th ( @xmath23th ) level kk particle for a single ( double ) non - universal extra dimension .",
    "since the leptons have not kk modes and the additional effects due to the extra dimensions are the functions of the ratio @xmath24 , there is a suppression in the numerical values of the expressions compared with the ones existing in the case of ued .",
    "however , we observe that , the br s of the processes under consideration enhances considerably large for two non - universal extra dimensions , due to the crowd of neutral higgs kk modes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the br s of lfv interactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the model iii version of the 2hdm with the inclusion of non - universal extra dimensions .",
    "section 3 is devoted to discussion and our conclusions .",
    "the radiative lfv decays exist at least in the one loop level and the theoretical values of their br s enhance with the extension of the higgs sector in the models beyond the sm .",
    "the model iii version of the 2hdm accepts the flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) at tree level and it is the candidate model to bring enhancement to the br s of the radiative lfv decays . with the inclusion of possible non - universal extra dimensions which are felt by gauge bosons and the new higgs particles , there appears an additional contribution to the br of the decays under consideration .",

    "however , they are irrelevant in our calculation since they do not play any role in the processes under consideration .    at this stage , we consider the flavor violating radiative decays of leptons , @xmath0 and @xmath12 , by introducing a single non - universal extra spatial dimension .",
