    "the impressive experimental demonstration of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) has stimulated a wealth of theoretical work aimed at a better understanding of its basic mechanism and of its potential consequences for the engineering of quantum devices @xcite .",
    "a well known general result @xcite is that for an ideal gas of bose particle , bec does not occur for homogeneous systems in dimension @xmath0 ; the same is true for non interacting bosons on regular periodic lattices .",
    "the result can not be extended to more general discrete structures lacking translational invariance , which , in principle , can now be implemented by combining quantum devices in non conventional discrete geometrical settings .",
    "the first important problem one is faced with is the characterization of the geometrical properties of a general network , i. e. a graph .",
    "on one hand , one is interested in describing the complex geometry of a sample and identifying its effects on physics . on the other ,",
    "once the effects of geometry are known , one can use the geometrical setting to tune the physical properties , by a sort of engineering in network design . as we will see ,",
    "this can lead to effects analogous to the introduction of an external confining potential for regular geometries .",
    "the problem of describing the large scale geometry of graphs by an effective parameter that generalize the euclidean dimension of regular lattices has been successfully solved by the introduction of the spectral dimension @xmath1 @xcite , which can be experimentally measured @xcite and rigorously defined by graph theory @xcite .",
    "however , one expects the influence of topology to be richer and more complex on discrete structures , due to the possible relevance of local geometrical details , in addition to the large scale structure described by dimensionality .    in this direction , recent works on bec on inhomogeneous networks @xcite have put into evidence that strong inhomogeneities can give rise to condensation at finite temperature for a system of non interacting bosons in absence of an external confining potential even in a low - dimensional structure as a comb lattice , where @xmath2 .",
    "this phenomenon arises from a peculiar part of the density of states on inhomogeneous networks we shall refer to as _ hidden spectrum _ @xcite .",
    "this hidden spectrum consists of an energy region filled by a finite or infinite number of states which do not contribute to the normalized density in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "hidden spectra do not usually affect bulk thermodynamic quantities but , as we shall show in the following , can have dramatic effects since bosonic statistics allows the macroscopic occupation of a single quantum state .    in this paper we shall determine the conditions under which , even for low dimensional systems , non - interacting bosons on a general discrete network may lead to bec @xcite .",
    "we shall see that this is indeed possible if one resorts to a suitable discrete inhomogeneous ambient space on which bosons are defined ; this is very desirable in view of the engineering of quantum devices .",
    "bosonic models over generic discrete structures can be made experimentally accessible through the realization of arrays of josephson junctions ( jja ) @xcite .",
    "the latter are devices that can be engineered to realize a variety of non - homogeneous patterns .",
    "we shall see indeed that classical @xcite jja arranged in a non - homogeneous network provide a relevant example of the proposed mechanism for bec , leading to a spatial condensation of bosons in a single state .",
    "the model hamiltonian describing the low - temperature jja is the bose - hubbard ( bh ) model @xcite . on a generic graph ,",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the adjacency matrix of the graph : @xmath5 if the sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 are nearest neighbours and @xmath8 otherwise ; @xmath9 creates a boson at site @xmath6 and @xmath10 .",
    "the phase diagram reflects the competition between the boson kinetic energy ( hopping term ) and the repulsive coulomb interaction . in a realistic experimental setup @xcite ,",
    "the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 depend on the ratio between the intergrain capacitance @xmath13 and the gate capacitance @xmath14 , while the parameter @xmath15 describes cooper pair hopping .",
    "classical jja are obtained when @xmath16 ( i.e. @xmath17 ) ; in this limit the hopping term dominates the physics of the system .",
    "recently , the bh model has been shown to describe the dynamics of ultracold bosonic atoms on a particular regular discrete geometry , the optical lattice @xcite . in this context",
    "the bh model describes the hopping of bosonic atoms between low vibrational states of the optical lattice ; the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath15 depend on the power of the laser beams used to realize the lattice .",
    "the dynamics of a bec in such a kind of periodic potential can thus be described by a discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite . also for atomic bose systems ,",
    "the experiments have reached an high level of accuracy with easily tunable external parameters and accurately tailored trapping profiles @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will consider a model of pure hopping of non interacting bosons on general non regular geometries , such as complex networks .",
    "in particular , we will analyse the possibility of having a bose - einstein condensate at finite temperature , providing a general condition for bec on a general network @xcite .",
    "we will describe in detail some geometrical settings where inhomogeneities act as a confining potential , giving rise to bec even in low dimensions .",
    "the extension of this analysis to the full bh model on complex networks is not trivial and it is still the object of on - going investigations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce the mathematical notations and some basic concepts in algebraic graph theory ; in section iii we define the pure hopping model and prove a general theorem giving the most general condition for the existence of bec at finite temperature for non interacting bosons on a complex network .",
    "we discuss in detail the presence of `` hidden '' regions in the density of states in the thermodynamic limit ; in section iv we apply the theorem to the case of the comb graph showing that bec at finite temperature is present in @xmath18-dimensional structures as a consequence of the effects of the inhomogeneous geometry on the density of states ; finally in section v we consider a wide class of networks where the relation between bec and complex geometry can be analyzed in detail .",
    "on complex networks it is not possible to introduce important mathematical tools typical of euclidean lattices , such as the fourier transform and the reciprocal lattice .",
    "nevertheless general and effective mathematical techniques are provided by graph theory and the algebraic approach to graph topology @xcite . in this section",
    "we briefly recall some basic definitions and notations .",
    "a graph @xmath19 is a countable set @xmath12 of vertices @xmath6 connected pairwise by a set @xmath20 of unoriented links @xmath21 . in general sites",
    "represent degrees of freedom and links represent interactions between them . in particular , for bosonic models , vertices can be regarded as josephson junctions or as sites in the optical networks , while edges represent the hopping probabilities between sites .",
    "a subgraph @xmath22 of @xmath19 is a graph whose set of vertices @xmath23 and whose set of links @xmath24 . a path in @xmath19 is a sequence of consecutive links @xmath25 and a graph is said to be connected , if for any two points @xmath26 there is always a path joining them . in the following",
    "we will consider connected graphs .",
    "every connected graph @xmath19 is endowed with an intrinsic metric generated by the chemical distance @xmath27 , which is defined as the number of links in the shortest path connecting vertices @xmath6 and @xmath7 . on a graph the generalized van hove sphere @xmath28 of center @xmath29 and radius @xmath30 is the subgraph of @xmath19 containing all @xmath31 whose distance from @xmath29 is @xmath32 and all the links of @xmath19 joining them .",
    "we will call @xmath33 the number of vertices contained in @xmath34 .",
    "the van hove spheres play an important role in the study of the thermodynamic limit on infinite graphs .",
    "the physical quantities are usually evaluated by first considering the models restricted to the finite spheres and then taking the thermodynamic limit by letting @xmath35 .",
    "the average in the thermodynamic limit @xmath36 of a bounded function defined on the vertices @xmath37 is : @xmath38 with this definition , the measure @xmath39 of a subset @xmath40 of @xmath12 is the average value of its characteristic function @xmath41 , defined by @xmath42 if @xmath43 and @xmath44 otherwise .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that for graphs with polynomial growth , i.e. when @xmath45 for @xmath35 , the thermodynamic limit is independent from the choice of the center of the sphere @xmath29 . since all realistic networks which can be embedded in a 3-dimensional space have polynomial growth , we restrict to this class graphs and we drop the index @xmath29 of the center of the sphere .",
    "the graph topology is algebraically described by its adjacency matrix : @xmath46    on disordered structures , a useful generalization of the adjacency matrix can be considered by introducing a bounded distribution of hopping probabilities @xmath47 which differs from link to link : @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "the laplacian matrix @xmath50 is defined by : @xmath51 where @xmath52 , the number of nearest neighbours of @xmath6 , is called the coordination number",
    ". we will consider graph with bounded coordination number , i.e. with @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath50 is the generalization to graphs of the usual laplacian on a lattice , where @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath50 has some important spectral properties : its spectrum is real , non - negative and bounded .",
    "in particular @xmath56 is a simple eigenvalue of @xmath50 corresponding to the constant eigenvector .",
    "notice that , while on a regular lattice @xmath50 is diagonalized by the fourier transform , this is not the case for a generic graph .",
    "a fundamental problem in graph theory is the characterization of the large scale geometry of the graph by the definition of a dimension which generalizes to infinite graphs the usual euclidean dimension @xmath57 of lattices .",
    "the spectrum of the laplacian operator defines the spectral dimension @xmath1 , which has been shown to be the extension of @xmath57 in many physical problems . on a infinite graph",
    ", the spectral density of the laplacian matrix is denoted by @xmath58 .",
    "the spectral dimension @xmath1 is defined by the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath58 at low eigenvalues @xcite : @xmath59 interestingly , @xmath1 can be a real number , it can be experimentally measured @xcite , it depends only on the large scale topology of the graph @xcite and it is the direct extension to graphs of the euclidean dimension in many physical problems . in particular , the long time asymptotic diffusion of classical particles @xcite , the low frequencies spectrum of classical harmonic oscillators @xcite , the zero mass limit of the gaussian model @xcite and the existence of spontaneous magnetization in continuous symmetry spin models @xcite are determined by the spectral dimension .",
    "the hamiltonian for non interacting bosons on a graph @xmath60 is : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the creation and annihilation operator at site @xmath6 , with @xmath64=\\delta_{ij}$ ] .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix @xmath65 is defined by : @xmath66 the term @xmath47 , defined in ( [ deft ] ) , describes hopping between nearest neighbours sites .",
    "the diagonal term @xmath67 takes into account a potential at site @xmath6 and it satisfies a boundedness condition : @xmath68 . in particular , the theorem holds also when @xmath69 , i.e. when there is no on site potential .",
    "the thermodynamic limit on the graph is studied by first considering the finite van hove sphere @xmath70 and then letting @xmath71 .",
    "this definition of the thermodynamic limit is very general and it applies to a general discrete structure . on graphs with symmetries ( lattices , fractals , bundled structures , etc . )",
    "different shapes of van hove spheres can be introduced , preserving the symmetry of the network .",
    "it can be shown that for regular choices of the spheres the properties of the model for @xmath71 do not depend on the shape of the sphere .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) restricted to the sphere is : @xmath72 where @xmath73 if @xmath6 and @xmath7 belong to @xmath70 and @xmath74 otherwise .",
    "for each finite sphere of radius @xmath30 let us consider the eigenvalues equation : @xmath75    the normalized density of states @xmath76 on @xmath70 is defined as : @xmath77 where @xmath78 are the @xmath79 eigenvalues of @xmath80 .",
    "we define @xmath81 to be the density of states of @xmath65 in the thermodynamic limit if : @xmath82 let @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the support of the distribution @xmath81 . on a graph ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior at low energies of the density of states is described by an exponent @xmath85 : @xmath86 the exponent @xmath85 in general depends both on graph topology and on the external potential .",
    "interestingly , when @xmath87 and when the external potential @xmath67 satisfy suitable regularity conditions , @xmath85 coincides with the spectral dimension @xmath1 . in particular",
    "this happens when @xmath69 .",
    "a _ hidden _ region of the spectrum is an energy interval @xmath88 $ ] such that @xmath88\\cap { \\rm supp}(\\rho(e))= \\emptyset$ ] and @xmath89}>0 $ ] , where @xmath90}$ ] is the number of eigenvalues of @xmath80 in the interval @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "notice that in general @xmath90}$ ] can diverge for @xmath35 and the eigenvalues can become dense in @xmath88 $ ] in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "therefore this condition not only includes the trivial case of discrete spectrum but is far more general ; an interesting example of this behaviour is found in the comb lattice without external potential @xcite which will be studied in detail in the next section .",
    "we now define the lowest energy level for the sequence of densities @xmath91 , setting @xmath92 and @xmath93 . in general ,",
    "if @xmath95 , then @xmath96 $ ] is a hidden region of the spectrum , which will be called hidden low - energy spectrum .    in the following we will consider models at fixed filling @xmath97 ( @xmath98 is the number of particles in the system ) . in the grand canonical ensemble",
    "the equation that determines the fugacity @xmath99 in the thermodynamic limit is : @xmath100 setting @xmath101 we have that @xmath102 .",
    "the integral in the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) can be divided into two sums , the first one considering the energies smaller than an arbitrary constant @xmath103 and the second the energies larger than @xmath103 : @xmath104    we define : @xmath105 as the fraction of particles with energy smaller than @xmath103 .",
    "bose - einstein condensation occurs in this systems if it exists a critical temperature @xmath106 such that , for any @xmath107 , @xmath108 , for all @xmath109 ; i.e. @xmath110 .    from definition ( [ ne ] ) ,",
    "@xmath111 can be strictly positive only if @xmath112 .",
    "indeed , if this limit is smaller than @xmath18 it follows that @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the number of state with energy smaller than @xmath103 .",
    "if the ground state is not infinitely degenerate , @xmath115 and then @xmath116 .",
    "taking first the limit @xmath117 and then @xmath118 in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) we obtain : @xmath119 now , from the boundedness of @xmath120 for @xmath121 and from the definition ( [ dens ] ) , the first of the two limits in the right hand side of ( [ eq4 ] ) vanishes : @xmath122 where , again , @xmath111 can be different from @xmath56 only if @xmath123 .",
    "the integral in equation ( [ eq7 ] ) is an increasing continuous function of @xmath99 with @xmath124 . if the limit : @xmath125 is equal to @xmath126 , then @xmath127 and @xmath116 .",
    "if the limit is finite , @xmath128 is a decreasing function of @xmath129 with @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "then , for a suitable @xmath132 , @xmath133 . for @xmath134 , ( i.e. @xmath107 ) @xmath123 and @xmath135 while for @xmath136 , ( i.e. @xmath137 ) @xmath127 and @xmath116 .    from the divergence or finiteness of the limit ( [ eq8 ] ) one obtains the most general condition for the occurrence of bose - einstein condensation on a graph .    first , if @xmath138 ( i.e. the system presents a low - energy hidden spectrum ) the limit ( [ eq8 ] ) is finite and there is bose - einstein condensation at finite temperature : @xmath139    on the other hand , when @xmath140 the value of the limit ( [ eq8 ] ) is determined by the exponent @xmath85 . indeed if @xmath141 : @xmath142 where @xmath143 and @xmath144 are suitable constants .",
    "therefore in this case bose - einstein condensation occurs at finite temperature .    for @xmath145",
    "we have : @xmath146 and there is no bose - einstein condensation . when @xmath147 we have to consider the logarithmic correction to ( [ defd ] ) and it is possible to show that the limit ( [ eq8 ] ) diverges .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) describes different models of non interacting bosons on graphs .",
    "the simplest example is the discretization of the usual schrdinger equation . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian is : @xmath148 , where @xmath50 is the laplacian operator .",
    "this is a pure topological model , completely defined by the graph geometry and it can be shown that @xmath140 , i.e. there are no hidden states in the low energy region and @xmath149",
    ". therefore the occurrence of bec is determined by the spectral dimension ( [ defdt ] ) , which has been calculated for a wide class of discrete networks @xcite .    on real condensed matter structures",
    "an interesting case is a pure hopping of non interacting bosons on graphs .",
    "this has been considered in @xcite for the description of the josephson junction arrays in the weak coupling limit with hamiltonian matrix given by : @xmath150 . in this case",
    "the behaviour of the model is much more complex and the presence of hidden spectra can give rise to bose - einstein condensation also in low dimensional structures @xcite .    finally , the most general application of our result concerns particles interacting with an external potential , described by the hamiltonian : @xmath151 .",
    "indeed , the introduction of a local potential strongly enhances the possibility of modifying the energy spectra in order to induce bec in non regular geometries .    in the next section",
    ", we will study in detail the pure hopping model defined on the comb graph , where the inhomogeneous topology produces low energy hidden states which give rise to bose - einstein condensation in a @xmath18-dimensional structure ( @xmath152 ) .",

    "these solutions appear only for @xmath202 and they satisfy relation ( [ eq10b ] ) .",
    "since the energy is a decreasing function of @xmath182 , the lowest energy level is obtained for @xmath219 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath220 , and in the thermodynamic limit this corresponds to @xmath221 . from ( [ sol2 ] )",
    "we get @xmath222 .",
    "the lowest energy in the normalized density of states is @xmath223 and therefore @xmath95 . then the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq1b ] )",
    "presents a hidden spectrum in the thermodynamic limit , and the pure hopping boson model on the comb lattice exhibits bec at low enough temperatures . from equations ( [ sol2],[eq8b],[eq9b ] ) it is also possible to show that on the infinite graph the eigenvector corresponding to the lowest energy eigenvalue is @xmath224 .",
    "the wave function for the condensate is localized along the backbone and it decreases exponentially along the finger ( see figure 3 ) .",

    "indeed for each value of @xmath195 ( @xmath202 ) there is a solution of ( [ eq10b ] ) with a different energy in the interval @xmath227 $ ] . in a finite comb of @xmath228 sites",
    "there are @xmath192 solution of this type and for @xmath229 these solutions fill densely the interval @xmath230 $ ] .",
    "normalizing the density of states to @xmath158 , we can obtain the spectral density in the thermodynamic limit for @xmath231 $ ] : @xmath232 an analogous equation holds for the spectral region at high energy ( @xmath233 $ ] ) , where the other hidden states appear .",
    "the density of states can then be represented as in figure 4 , where we used the two different normalizations for the hidden spectra and for @xmath81 .",
    "> from the knowledge of the complete spectral density of the comb , the thermodynamic quantities relative to bec such as the filling of the ground state as a function of @xmath234 , the specific heat and the critical temperature as a function of @xmath215 can be analytically calculated @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the pure hopping model can be studied in detail in a wide class of fractals and inhomogeneous discrete structures . in particular , the behaviour observed in the comb lattice is typical of bundle structures @xcite .",
    "this class of graphs are obtained by a `` fibering '' procedure , i.e. attaching a fiber graph to every point of a `` base '' graph .",
    "they are characterized by a hidden low - energy region , and from the general result of section iii they exhibit bec at finite temperature . moreover , as in the comb graph , the wave function of the condensate is localized along the base and presents a fast decay along the fibers .",
    "an example of this behaviour is found in the brush graph , which is illustrated in figure 5 .",
    "an interesting example of a graph where the geometrical setting gives rise to an isolated eigenstate in the low - energy region of the pure hopping model is the star graph .",
    "the effect , which is analogous to that caused by an impurity on a line , here is not produced by the presence of an external potential but simply by the topology of the system .",
    "interestingly , the wave function is here completely localized in the center of the star , with an exponential decay along the arms . in figure 6 the star graph with the ground state and the spectrum of the pure hopping model are shown .",
    "graphs with constant coordination number are typical examples in which the pure hopping model do not present hidden low energy regions .",
    "this is due to the fact that for this class of graphs the spectrum of the model can be obtained from that of the laplacian matrix by a shift of the zero in the energy . the existence of bec is therefore determined by the spectral dimension @xmath235 of the graph , describing the density of eigenvalues of the laplacian at low energy",
    "this parameter can be exactly calculated for a wide class of discrete structures .",
    "on lattices , @xmath1 coincides with the usual euclidean dimension and one recovers the classical result for bec on translation invariant structures . for exactly decimable graphs @xcite ( e.g. the sierpinski gasket @xcite and the t - fractal , see figure 7 ) where one always has @xmath236",
    "there is no bose - einstein condensation .",
    "a fundamental property of the spectral dimension is its independence from the local details of the graph , i.e. universality @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath1 and the behaviour of the density of eigenvalues in the low energy region is not changed under a wide class of transformations , called isospectralities , which can strongly modify the geometry of the graph .",
    "a simple consequence of this property is that if we consider the pure hopping model on a graph with constant coordination number , which differs from a graph of known dimension @xmath1 by an isospectrality , bec occurs only if @xmath237 .",
    "an example of this behaviour is given by the ladder graph ( figure 8) which can be obtained from the linear chain by the addition of finite - range links .",
    "on this structure then the pure hopping model does not exhibit bec .",
    "an important properties of @xmath1 is that the dimension of the graph obtained as a direct product of two graphs is the sum of the dimensions of the original structures .",
    "an example is illustrated in figure 9 , where we show the direct product of a linear chain and a well known fractal , a sierpinski gasket . in this the coordination number case @xmath238 is constant , and applying the previous properties it is easy to show that @xmath239 , and therefore , applying the previous results , one immediately infers that bec occurs on this graph .",
    "we studied in detail bec of non - interacting bosons on general discrete networks , i. e. on graphs .",
    "we evidenced that these systems support spatial condensation of bosons into a single state even if @xmath240 .",
    "due to recent advances in engineering technology , josephson junction networks can be build in a variety of controllable , non - conventional architectures .",
    "the theoretical interest for these systems stems naturally from the ability of experimentalists in varying the properties of the networks by acting directly on their geometry .",
    "we expect that non universal quantities - such as the critical temperature for condensation - will depend crucially on the geometry of a graph , thus leading to the possibility of engineering network geometries suitable to observe spatial bec of cooper pairs .",
    "our analysis shows that classical inhomogeneous josephson junction networks build on graphs may support a spatial bec of cooper pairs induced only by the geometry of the ambient space on which the junctions lie .",
    "we feel our prediction of the existence of spatial bec in josephson junction networks may be brought soon to direct experimental testing .",
