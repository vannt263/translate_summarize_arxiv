    "the excited states of the nucleon and their strong interactions with various hadrons play an important role in our understanding of non - perturbative qcd . generally speaking",
    ", their coupling with the pseudoscalar pion , kaon and eta is governed by chiral dynamics .",
    "the first excited state of the nucleon , @xmath0 @xmath1 , belongs to the lightest decuplet .",
    "it is degenerate with the nucleon in the large @xmath2 limit @xcite . from the strong decay widths ,",
    "one can extract the coupling constants of the pseudoscalar meson decuplet baryon interaction . although it may be quite difficult to measure their scattering lengths experimentally , unlike in the pion - nucleon and kaon - nucleon cases @xcite , it is still interesting to study the scattering processes theoretically .    as two",
    "well - known non - perturbative approaches of qcd at low energy , chiral perturbation theory and lattice qcd have been widely used in studying meson - baryon interactions @xcite . with the explicitly consistent power counting scheme ,",
    "the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hb@xmath3pt ) is a practical and useful tool in the study of the meson baryon scattering .",
    "the expansion is organized with @xmath4 , where @xmath5 represents the momentum ( mass ) of the meson or the small residue momentum of the baryon in the non - relativistic limit , and @xmath6 is the scale of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "numerically it is around the baryon mass in the chiral limit . because of the large mass of the strange quark , the chiral corrections from the kaon and eta meson loops are significantly larger than that from the pion loop , which leads to the worse convergence of the chiral expansion in the su(3 ) case .    in hb@xmath3pt ,",
    "the effects of excited baryons are encoded in the unknown low energy constants ( lecs ) in the lagrangians . in the large @xmath2 limit",
    ", one expects that the inclusion of the decuplet baryon contribution may partially cancel the octet contribution and be helpful to the chiral expansion . in order to investigate the contributions of the @xmath7 , hb@xmath3pt with explicit spin-3/2 baryons and the small - scale expansion scheme",
    "have been developed in refs .",
    "now the expansion is organized with @xmath8 , where @xmath8 means @xmath5 in hb@xmath3pt or the mass difference @xmath9 between @xmath7 and the nucleon in the chiral limit , which is widely used in the exploration of the decuplet related processes @xcite .",
    "there exists another power counting scheme `` @xmath9 expansion '' in the two - flavor case , where @xmath10 scales as @xmath11 @xcite .    in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we studied the decuplet contributions to the pseudoscalar meson octet baryon scattering lengths , which is an important observable reflecting their strong interaction near the threshold .",
    "the inclusion of the decuplet baryons does not improve the convergence significantly . in this paper",
    ", we will study the scattering lengths of the pseudoscalar mesons and the light decuplet baryons in the framework of the su(3 ) heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory with explicit decuplet baryons .",

    "moreover , we have calculated the @xmath12-matrices of all 80 channels explicitly .",

    "the vector mesons do not contribute because of the same reason .    adding the above effective lagrangians ( [ leff1520 ] ) , ( [ leff1600 ] ) , ( [ leff600 ] ) , and ( [ leff800 ] ) together , we have @xmath95 now one estimates the lecs by comparing it with the lagrangian ( [ l2 ] ) , @xmath96    it is not difficult to determine the coupling constant @xmath97 according to the decay width . from the lagrangian ( [ ln1520 ] ) and the decay to @xmath98 , one deduces @xmath99 here @xmath100 is the decay momentum , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 . from the pdg @xcite ,",
    "one derives @xmath103 with the same procedure , we derive the coupling constant @xmath104 , @xmath105    for the coupling constants @xmath106 and @xmath107 , we use @xcite @xmath108 although there is no empirical value of @xmath109 , one may estimate it by comparing @xmath65 obtained with the resonance saturation method in ( [ lec2 ] ) with that from the mass splitting in ( [ d4 ] ) , @xmath110 in addition , the coupling constants should obey the nonet relations in the large @xmath2 limit , @xmath111    by combining the above relations , the estimated lecs at @xmath48 are @xmath112    in a similar way , one may consider the high order corrections and estimate the @xmath113 lecs @xmath114@xmath115 . due to the uncertainty of this method , we tend to neglect these counter terms in the following calculation . this assumption was adopted in the study of the meson - baryon scattering lengths in refs . @xcite .",
    "the counter terms of the @xmath81 scattering lengths are found to be much smaller than the loop contributions at this order in ref .",
    "however , to explore the orders of the counter terms , we have made a very crude estimate about these lecs @xmath114@xmath115 , which are collected in the appendix [ append ] .",
    "we set @xmath42 at @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 respectively for the pion , kaon and @xmath119-scattering in our numerical analysis .",
