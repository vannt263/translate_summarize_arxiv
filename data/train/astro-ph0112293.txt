    "hard x  ray surveys represent thus the most efficient method to search for and to trace the cosmological evolution of accretion - powered sources .",
    "a still unknown fraction of obscured radiation is reprocessed and remitted in the far  infrared band .",

    "are summarized .",
    "the main scientific drive of this project is to probe the obscured accretion history of the x  ray universe .",

    "the high energy large area survey ( hellas ; fiore et al . 1999 , 2001a ) has provided , for the first time before the advent of the new x  ray observatories _ chandra _ and xmm_newton _ , a well - defined and large - area sample of hard ( 510 kev ) x  ray selected sources obtained with an imaging instrument ( the mecs instrument onboard _ bepposax _ ) . at the flux limit of about 5 @xmath0 10@xmath1 @xmath2 ,",

    "even if the optical identification are dominated by type 1 agn , the relative fraction of type 2 objects ( including seyfert  1.8 , 1.9 and emission  line galaxies ) vs. type  1 is about 0.40 , considerably higher than the value of 0.25 found in the _ rosat _ ultradeep survey ( lehmann et al .",
    "2001a ) and that of 0.20 in the _ asca _ large area survey ( lss ; akiyama et al .",

    "can be explained assuming a dust - to - gas ratio significantly lower than the galactic value . from a physical perspective , this could imply the presence of a population of dust grains with different properties ( e.g. , large size ) than previously known or thought ( maiolino et al .",
    "strong x  ray absorption ( @xmath7 @xmath8 10@xmath9 @xmath10 ) in high - redshift broad - line agns has also been suggested to explain the x  ray properties of four objects detected in the course of the _ asca _ lss ( akiyama et al .",
    "2000 ) , and recent results from _ chandra _ observations seem to confirm this result at lower x  ray fluxes ( fiore et al .",
    "2000 , akiyama et al .",
    "the discovery of x  ray absorption in optically `` normal '' broad - line agns has important consequences for the agn synthesis models for the xrb . according to these models , the sources responsible for the xrb must be characterized by a spectral energy density spanning a wide range of luminosities and absorption column densities , in order to reproduce both the xrb spectrum and the source counts in different energy ranges . in particular ,",
    "the energetically dominant contribution comes from sources around the knee of the x  ray luminosity function ( @xmath11 @xmath3 a few 10@xmath12 erg s@xmath13 at z=1 ) and with absorbing column densities of the order of 10@xmath9 @xmath10 ( comastri 2000 ) .",
    "if one relies on the agn unified model , these objects , the so - called `` qso2 '' , are expected to be the luminous counterparts of the local seyfert 2 galaxies with narrow optical emission lines .",
    "despite extensive searches only a handful of candidates have been found , the most remarkable example being the @xmath14=3.7 quasar discovered in the _ chandra _ deep field south ( norman et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the results obtained by hellas suggest that if the statement : obscured type  2 @xmath15 narrow optical lines is not always true , the moderate / high - redshift absorbed type  1 objects could have the same role of the so far elusive class of qso2 in contributing to the xrb ( comastri et al .",
    "2001 ) .    absorption column densities in excess to the galactic one , often larger than 10@xmath1610@xmath9 @xmath10 , are also derived combining archival _ rosat _",

    "interesting enough , this broad - band x  ray analysis has revealed that a fraction of sources which are though to be absorbed in the hard x ",
    "rays are characterized by hard colors also in soft x  rays .",
    "this means that , although with lower efficiency , it is possible to pick up absorbed objects in the soft x  rays .",
    "it must be noted that some evidences of absorbed objects have also been obtained from the _ rosat _ deep and ultradeep surveys in the lockman hole ( hasinger et al .",
    "1998 ; lehmann et al .",
    "2000 , 2001a ) .",
    "_ rosat _ observations of the hellas sources suggest that their average spectral properties are not well accounted for by a simple absorbed power - law model .",
    "more complex spectra are required in a high number of cases , and this is particularly true for very absorbed objects .",
    "additional soft components possibly due to scattered nuclear flux and/or starburst components are required , in most cases involving about 1050 % of the primary radiation ( vignali et al .",
    "similar results have been obtained by _ asca _ ( della ceca et al . 1999 ) .",
    "remarkable results have been obtained also by the photometric follow - up observations of a subsample of hellas sources .",
    "interesting enough , the optical and the near - infrared properties of a fraction of intermediate ( 1.81.9 ) and type  2 objects ( maiolino et al . 2000 ) , as well as red quasars ( vignali et al . 2000 ) , are dominated by the stellar component of the galaxies hosting the ( obscured ) x  ray active nucleus .",
    "this result has straightforward consequences , since it implies that a fraction of sources responsible for the hard xrb may be hosted by normal , passively - evolving galaxies , possibly being missed by previous optical surveys based on color - selection criteria .",
    "the hellas2xmm survey aims to cover a portion of the redshift ",
    "luminosity plane which can not be probed by deep pencil - beam surveys .",
    "the main purpose of this complementary approach is to study the x  ray source populations at fluxes where a large fraction of the hard x - ray cosmic background ( hxrb ) is resolved ( @xmath17 at @xmath18 , see e.g. comastri 2000 ) , but where a ) the area covered is as large as possible , to be able to find sizeable samples of `` rare '' objects ; b ) the x - ray flux is high enough to provide at least rough x - ray spectral information ; and c ) the magnitude of the optical counterparts is bright enough to allow , at least in the majority of the cases , relatively high - quality optical spectroscopy , useful to investigate the physics of the sources . our goal is to evaluate for the first time the luminosity function of hard x - ray selected sources in wide luminosity and redshift ranges . by integrating this luminosity function we will compute the hard x - ray luminosity density per unit volume due to accretion as a function of the redshift . a comparison with the history of the uv luminosity density ( proportional to the history of the star - formation )",
    "may give us a clue on the correlations between formation and evolution of agn and supermassive black holes and formation and evolution of galaxies .",
