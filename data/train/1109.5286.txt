    "in an earlier paper  @xcite , hereafter referred to as paper  i , we presented a theoretical framework for analyzing snapshots formed by scattering . in this paper , we demonstrate the power of this approach to reconstruct three - dimensional ( 3d ) models and time - series from random sightings at extremely low signal , with no orientational or timing information .",
    "the theoretical framework in paper  i represents the information content of an ensemble of snapshots as a riemannian manifold , and shows that the properties of operations in space give rise to object - independent symmetries .",
    "purposeful navigation on this manifold is tantamount to reconstructing a 3d model of the sighted system and/or its evolution , in the sense that given any snapshot , any other can be produced on demand .",
    "the symmetries of the manifold reveal its natural eigenfunctions , thus allowing physically - based interpretation of graph - theoretic analysis , and enhanced noise discrimination .",
    "simple algorithms then suffice to reach exceptionally low signal - to - noise levels unmatched by other approaches in terms of computational cost , noise robustness , or both . as examples , we demonstrate structure recovery from radiation - sensitive objects at doses at least an order of magnitude below current levels ( signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) : @xmath0 ) , and reconstruction of time - series at snr values as low as @xmath1 . the versatility of the approach is demonstrated in the context of simulated and experimental data from x - ray diffraction , cryo - electron microscopy ( cryo - em ) , and optical snapshots using a variety of graph - theoretic techniques .",
    "these applications demonstrate the generality of the symmetry - based approach , elucidating at the same time the measures needed to deal successfully with experimental data , a key benchmark of the practical utility of any theoretical framework .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . without claim to be comprehensive , sec .",

    "detailed points of a technical nature are elucidated in appendices , and movies provided as supplementary online material epaps  @xcite .",
    "as described in paper  i , we are concerned with constructing a model from random sightings of a system viewed in some projection , i.e. , by accessing a limited number of variables describing the state of the system .",
    "a 3d model of an object and its evolution , for example , can be constructed from an ensemble of low - signal 2d snapshots without orientational information  @xcite .",
    "modern graph - theoretic algorithms can now be used to discover low - dimensional manifolds representing the information content of datasets in some high - dimensional space determined by the measurement apparatus  @xcite .",
    "the power of these methods stems from their generality , in the sense that no assumptions are made as to the nature of the data or their internal correlations .",
    "this brings with it four major challenges : ( 1 ) interpretation of the analysis results ( `` what physical variables do the manifold dimensions represent ? '' ) ; ( 2 ) computational cost and scaling behavior on moving from simulated ( `` toy '' ) datasets to experimental measurements ; ( 3 ) robustness against noise , particularly of non - additive , non - gaussian types ; and ( 4 ) incorporation of inevitable and/or desirable experimental factors ( `` utility of the theoretical framework in practice '' . )",
    "these issues can be brought to focus in the context of the much - discussed problem of recovering the orientation of cryo - em snapshots of faint biological objects .",
    "direct graph - theoretic attempts to determine the orientation of snapshots from a synthetic object were abandoned at a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of @xmath2 db , even though only additive gaussian noise was included  @xcite .",
    "noting that graph - theoretic analyses often `` fail to solve the cryo - em problem , because the reduced coordinate system that each of them obtains does not agree with the projection directions ''  @xcite , properties specific to cryo - em images were used to extract information from the snapshots .",
    "graphs were then constructed using this information in order to assign physical meaning to the outcome of the analysis .",
    "orienting low - signal cryo - em snapshots by utilizing so - called ( straight ) common - lines identified primarily in simulated data with additive gaussian noise has reached remarkably low snr values  @xcite",
    ". however , such assumptions , while justified under some circumstances , are not generally valid .",
    "common - lines , for example , are present only when elastic single - scattering dominates , are straight only when the wavelength of the incident radiation is so short that the ewald sphere can be replaced by a plane , and are compromised by defocus variations essential for reliable structure recovery by cryo - em  @xcite .",
    "symmetry - based assignment of physical meaning to the outcome of graph - theoretic analysis of scattering data and its favorable computational consequences were addressed in paper  i. here , we are concerned with ability of this theoretical framework to deal with noise and other important factors encountered in experimental datasets .",
    "this determines the practical utility of an approach as much as theoretical elegance and computational efficiency .",
    "below , we demonstrate the utility of our symmetry - based approach by applying a number of manifold - embedding techniques to a variety of simulated and experimental datasets ( see table  [ tabapplication ] ) .",
    "a snapshot formed on a 2d detector by scattered radiation from an object can be represented by a vector , with the intensity values recorded at the @xmath3 detector pixels as components ( paper  i , fig .  1 ) .",
    "object motion and/or evolution ( dynamics ) change the pixel intensities , causing `` the vector tips '' representing the ensemble of snapshots to trace out a surface  a manifold  in the @xmath3-dimensional data space .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom available to the object determines the dimensionality of the manifold traced out .",
    "rotations of a rigid object in 3d , for example , result in a 3d manifold .",
    "the data manifold represents the totality of information about the object gathered by the detector in the course of an observation .",
    "learning is tantamount to understanding the properties of this manifold sufficiently to `` navigate '' on it .",
    "learning the manifold generated by object rotations , for example , is equivalent to constructing a 3d model of the object , because , starting from any 2d projection ( point on the manifold ) any other 2d projection can be found by navigation , with the shortest route corresponding to a geodesic .    as we are initially concerned with constructing 3d models from 2d snapshots , we consider a formulation of scattering by a single object in fourier space so as to concentrate on the effect of rotations .",
    "this circumvents issues such as rigid shifts , which would otherwise have to be corrected or incorporated as additional manifold dimensions .",
    "rotation operations do not commute .",
    "one must therefore consider the order in which they are performed .",
    "this leads to a distinction between so - called left and right `` translations , '' where a rotation operator @xmath4 is placed to the left or right of another rotation operator @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath6 vs.  @xmath7 .",
    "a left translation can be thought of as an active rotation in 3d space of the incident beam - detector arrangement ( frame rotation ) after @xmath5 .",
    "similarly , a right translation corresponds to an active rotation of the object ( object rotation ) before @xmath5 .",
    "as @xmath8 , left and right translations must be considered separately .",
    "each forms an so(3 ) group , and the total set of possible operations to be considered corresponds to @xmath9 .",
    "a key question is this : which , if any , of these operations leave the distances on the manifold unchanged , i.e. , which operations are `` invisible '' to an ant crawling on the manifold ? these operations would represent symmetries  more precisely isometries  of the manifold . for a detector with circular symmetry , the distances on the manifold are invariant under beam - detector rotations about the beam axis .",
    "this is obvious ; a frame rotation about the beam axis rotates all the snapshots by the same amount about that axis without changing them .",
    "this leaves the distances on the manifold unchanged .",
    "the process of image formation on a circularly - symmetric detector at right angles to the illuminating beam thus has @xmath10 isometry , i.e. , of all possible @xmath11 frame operations , the @xmath10 subset of rotations about the beam direction leave the distances on the manifold unchanged .",
    "this is related to the projection of a 3d object on the 2d detector , which is equivalent to a `` central slice '' through the diffraction volume in reciprocal space .",
    "consider next the @xmath11 set of operations corresponding to object rotations .",
    "it turns out that the metric measuring distance on the manifold can be decomposed into a homogeneous part , which varies uniformly with object rotation , plus a residual term , which acts as a fingerprint of the object ( see paper  i sec .",
    "iii  c ) .",
    "considering the homogeneous part only , the total set of symmetries , is then @xmath12 .",
    "the same set of symmetries appears in certain models of the universe in general relativity  @xcite , and is associated with well - known eigenfunctions familiar in the context of spinning tops in classical and quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "the key point here is that the knowledge of the manifold symmetries , which stem from the nature of operations in space , allows one to determine the leading - order properties of the manifold under a very general set of scattering scenarios , including its natural eigenfunctions .",
    "projection of noisy datasets on these eigenfunctions is tantamount to noise discrimination .",
    "the components of a data point representing a snapshot can then be directly related to its orientation ( see paper  i sec .",
    "iii  d ) .",
    "it has long been known that the use of problem - specific constraints can substantially increase computational efficiency @xcite . by combining wide applicability with class specificity ,",
    "symmetries represent a particularly powerful example of such constraints . in paper",
    "i , we used the object - independent symmetries of image formation to recover 3d structure from a large ensemble of simulated , noise - free diffraction snapshots with a computational complexity @xmath13 higher than the state of the art . here",
    "we demonstrate the noise robustness stemming from exploiting the symmetries of image formation .",
    "examples include orientation recovery , 3d reconstruction , and movie extraction from ultra - low - signal diffraction or image snapshots of periodic and non - periodic objects and dynamical systems .",
    "each example was selected to highlight an important application area . as shown in table  [ tabapplication ]",
    ", a variety of manifold - embedding techniques can be used .    .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     next , we enter an iteration loop , where in the @xmath14-th step the dataset @xmath15 is computed , and the algorithm in table  [ algautotuning ] executed using @xmath16 as input data .",
    "the resulting quaternion estimates , nearest - neighbor indices , and least - squares residual are respectively designated @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "note that the residual @xmath19 is a measure of the difference between the eigenfunctions obtained by embedding and the natural eigenfunctions ( wigner @xmath20-functions ) expected on the basis of symmetry ( see paper  i ) .",
    "if , after an iteration @xmath14 , @xmath21 is larger than the residual @xmath22 encountered in the previous step , the loop is terminated . otherwise , the iteration is repeated using @xmath18 as an updated estimate of the true nearest - neighbor indices .",
    "our final orientation ( quaternion ) assignment is the one corresponding to the minimum least - squares residual , reached in the iteration prior to the termination step .    the empirical evidence in sec .",
    "[ secsimulateddata ] clearly shows that , given a sufficiently large number of sample points , the scheme , applied only a handful of times and terminated using the value of @xmath23 as a criterion , provides noise reduction sufficient for accurate orientation recovery at @xmath24 .",
    "a potentially fruitful way of interpreting mathematically the success of the process ( which lies outside the scope of the present paper ) would be to explore its connections with mutually reinforcing models ( mrms ) for graph filtering @xcite .",
    "this type of model involves iteratively replacing vertices of graphs with weighted averages , whereby the vertex itself and its local neighborhood exert an influence on the vertex in the course of iterative updates . in certain applications , the iterative process in an mrm",
    "is terminated after only a small number of iterations .",
    "both of these two features are present in the scheme presented here .",
    "the calculations reported in this work were primarily performed on a rocks cluster with 30  nodes , each consisting of two 2.5 ghz quad - core intel xeon cpus with 16 gb ram .",
    "algorithms were usually implemented in matlab r2009b with the parallel computing toolbox together with the matlab distributed server using up to 120 workers ( parallel processes ) . for less intensive calculations , a linux workstation with a 2.66 ghz quad - core intel xeon cpu , 32 gb ram and/or a mac  pro @xmath25 ghz quad - core intel xeon cpus , 10 gb ram were used . in diffusion map , by far the most cpu - intensive calculations are : ( 1 ) the determination of the euclidean distances of snapshots ; and ( 2 ) setting up of the sparse distance matrix of nearest neighbors .",
    "these calculations were performed in parallel using 100  workers .",
    "such a distance calculation involving @xmath26 snapshots typically takes 7  hours for chignolin and 48  hours for adenylate kinase ( adk ) in paper  i. other calculations , including the eigenvector determination and the estimation of the orientation matrices were performed on the linux workstation in about 8  hours altogether . in total ,",
    "the orientation determination for @xmath26 snapshots requires 56  hours for noise - free adk and 33  hours for noisy chignolin with 5  local - averaging iterations . compiling a 3d diffraction volume consisting of a uniform cartesian grid",
    "was implemented in parallel code , with an execution time of less than three hours for two million adk diffraction snapshots using 80 workers .",
    "diffraction patterns and cryo - em images were simulated on the cluster and on the mac pro .",
    "the gtm and phasing algorithms were performed on the linux workstation and/or the mac  pro .",
    "the chimera package  @xcite was used to visualize electron density maps .",
