    "statistical mechanics tells us that observables are fluctuating even in equilibrated medium .",
    "because the fluctuations are determined by the microscopic nature of the medium and sensitive to critical phenomena , they can be exploited to reveal and characterize properties of the medium . in experimental attempts to map the global nature of qcd phase transition at nonzero baryon density in relativistic heavy ion collisions , fluctuation observables , especially those of conserved charges ,",
    "are believed to be promising observables to diagnose the property of the hot medium @xcite .",
    "active investigation in heavy ion collisions by event - by - event analyses has recently been performed at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "numerical analyses of higher order cumulants in equilibrium have been also carried out in lattice qcd monte carlo simulations @xcite .    as an experiment in which fluctuations are measured ,",
    "heavy ion collisions have several notable features .",
    "first , higher order cumulants , which characterize the non - gaussian nature of fluctuations , have been experimentally observed with good statistics up to the fourth order @xcite .",
    "the measurement is possible because the system observed in the experiments is not large ; the observed particle number is at most of order @xmath0 , while the event - by - event statistics exceed @xmath1 .",
    "second , the fluctuations observed in experiments , especially those of conserved charges , are not necessarily the same as those in an equilibrated medium , because of the dynamical nature of the hot medium created by heavy ion collisions .",
    "because of these properties , an appropriate description of the dynamical evolution of non - gaussian fluctuations is required in order to understand the experimental results on higher order cumulants .    concerning the second point , we remark that the recent experimental result on the net - electric charge fluctuation , @xmath2 , by alice collaboration at lhc @xcite supports the non - thermal nature of the observed fluctuation .",
    "the value of @xmath2 in this experiment is suppressed compared with the one in the equilibrated hadronic medium which has been calculated by lattice qcd simulations @xcite and the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model @xcite .",
    "moreover , the dependence of @xmath2 on the size of the rapidity window , @xmath3 , shows that the suppression of @xmath2 is more pronounced for larger @xmath3 .",
    "these experimental results are reasonably explained if one attributes the suppression to the survival of fluctuations generated in the primordial deconfined medium @xcite . the charge fluctuation normalized by the total number of charged particles , @xmath4 ,",
    "is known to take @xmath5 times smaller value in the equilibrated deconfined medium than the hadronic one @xcite .",
    "after hadronization , this small fluctuation approaches the equilibrated value in the hadronic medium . since the variation of the local density of a conserved charge is achieved only through diffusion , the approach of the fluctuation to the equilibrated value becomes slower as the volume where the charge is counted becomes larger .",
    "@xmath2 thus takes a smaller value as @xmath3 becomes larger , which is consistent with the experimental result at alice .    on the other hand ,",
    "the value of @xmath2 observed at rhic energy is consistent with the one in the equilibrated hadronic medium @xcite .",
    "the difference between rhic and lhc energies indicates that the evolution of the fluctuation in the hot medium is qualitatively different between these energies .    in order to confirm the validity of the above explanation on the fluctuation measured at alice and clarify the origin of the qualitative difference between the experimental results at rhic and lhc energies",
    ", it should be instructive to measure the @xmath3 dependences of various other fluctuation observables in addition to @xmath2 in these experiments .",
    "for example , the net - baryon number fluctuation , @xmath6 , is an experimentally - observable conserved charge fluctuation @xcite , although neutral baryons are not directly observable .",
    "because the diffusion of the baryon number in the hadronic phase is slower than that of the electric charge due to the large mass of its carriers , baryons , if the origin of the suppression of @xmath2 at alice is indeed traced back to the smallness of the primordial fluctuations , @xmath6 must have steeper suppression as a function of @xmath3 than @xmath2 .    in event - by - event analyses",
    ", one can also measure higher order cumulants of conserved charges @xcite such as the fourth - order ones @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the experimental analysis of these observables as functions of @xmath3 can obviously provide us more information on the time evolution of fluctuations in the hot medium .",
    "so far , however , systematic studies on the dynamical evolution of higher order cumulants in heavy ion collisions , whose results can be compared with their experimental observation , have not been carried out to the best of the authors knowledge .",
    "the purpose of the present letter is to make the first investigation on this issue using a simple but theoretically lucid model , and to make a prediction on the @xmath3 dependence of higher order cumulants in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "in relativistic heavy ion collisions with sufficiently large collision energy per nucleon , @xmath9 , the hot medium created at mid - rapidity has an approximate boost invariance .",
    "useful coordinates to describe such a system are the coordinate - space rapidity @xmath10 and proper time @xmath11 .",
    "we denote the net number of a conserved charge per unit coordinate - space rapidity as @xmath12 . in a class of experiments , event - by - event fluctuations of the charge at kinetic freezeout in a phase space corresponding to the rapidity window determined by the experiment are observed .",
    "the phase space approximately corresponds to a finite coordinate - space rapidity interval @xcite . assuming that the kinetic freezeout takes place at a certain proper time @xmath13 , the experimentally - observed conserved - charge number at mid - rapidity at rhic and lhc is given by @xmath14 at @xmath15 with the rapidity window of the detector @xmath3 . in the following ,",
    "we investigate the time evolution of higher order cumulants of @xmath16 .    in a sufficiently large space - time scale where hydrodynamic equations at first order are applicable",

    "( [ eq : diffusion ] ) , one may employ a stochastic model , in which the time evolution of the deterministic part satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffusion ] ) .",
    "a choice of such stochastic models is the theory of hydrodynamic fluctuations @xcite , in which the hydrodynamic equations are promoted to langevin equations with stochastic terms representing fast random forces arising from microscopic interactions . in the equation corresponding to the conservation law of a charge , eq .",

    "it is known that the stochastic equation determined in this way well describes gaussian fluctuations in fluids @xcite . however ,",
    "extension of this formalism to treat higher order fluctuations is nontrivial .",
    "there is no unique generalization of the fluctuation - dissipation relation to higher orders , or no a priori justification of such extensions .    concerning the difficulty in the description of non - gaussian fluctuations , it is worthwhile to note a theorem on markov process , which states that stochastic forces in a langevin equation for markov process are of gaussian when the equation describes stochastic variables which are continuous and vary continuously and @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 be the conditional probability of @xmath24 at time @xmath25 given the system was at @xmath22 at time @xmath26 .",

    "since the standard theory of hydrodynamic fluctuations describes a markov process and the hydrodynamic variables are continuous , the theorem demands that @xmath21 be of gaussian ; to allow for nonzero higher order correlations of @xmath21 , one must relax at least one of the two conditions , i.e. markovian and the continuity .    without the higher order correlation of @xmath21 ,",
    "all higher order cumulants vanish in equilibrium .",
    "even in such a formalism , the relaxation of non - gaussianity starting from a particular initial condition can be described . in the physics of fluctuations in relativistic heavy ion collisions , however , nonzero higher order cumulants in equilibrium play a crucial role .",

    ", however , we represent the system as follows ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig : dme ] ) .",
    "first , the coordinate @xmath10 is divided into discrete cells with an equal length @xmath29 .",
    "second , we consider a single species of particle for the moment , and denote the number of particles in each cell , labeled by an integer @xmath30 , as @xmath31 , and the probability that each cell contains @xmath31 particles as @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "finally , we assume that each particle moves to adjacent cells with a probability @xmath34 per unit proper time , as a result of microscopic interactions and random motion .",
    "the probability @xmath32 then follows the differential equation @xmath35 , \\label{eq : dme}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is referred to as _ diffusion master equation _ in literature @xcite , where @xmath36 is the vector that all components are zero except for @xmath30th one , which takes unity .",
    "we will see later that in the continuum limit , @xmath37 , the average density and gaussian fluctuation of @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dme ] ) agree with those in the stochastic diffusion equation with @xmath38 .    before solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : dme ] ) , some remarks are in order here .",
    "first , eq .",
    "( [ eq : dme ] ) is often solved with an approximation that @xmath31 are sufficiently large so that they can be regarded as continuous @xcite . for the present purpose ,",
    "however , the equation should be solved without this approximation , because once @xmath31 are set continuous , using an argument similar to the proof of the above - mentioned theorem on markov processes one can show that all higher order cumulants become zero in equilibrium @xcite .",
    "discrete nature of @xmath31 should be kept to give rise to non - gaussianity in equilibrium .",
    "second , particles described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dme ] ) behave as brownian particles @xcite without correlations with one another . from this property",
    ", it is immediately concluded that the distribution of @xmath39 in the @xmath40 limit becomes of poissonian , in which all cumulants take the same value @xmath41 , provided that @xmath3 is sufficiently narrower than the total length of the system .",
    "note that this behavior of cumulants is consistent with the hadronic fluctuations in the hrg model , owing to the non - interacting nature of hadrons in this model . finally , since eq .",
    "( [ eq : dme ] ) describes a markov process , stochastic effects in this model do not have temporal correlations .",
    "this model , therefore , would not be suitable to describe non - gaussian fluctuations enhanced near the critical point , where the stochastic forces would have strong temporal correlation and thus the process becomes a non - markov one due to critical slowing down .",
    "in the experimental results obtained so far , however , significant enhancements of cumulants which could be attributed to critical phenomena are not observed @xcite .",
    "this result implies that critical phenomena do not come into play in the diffusion in the hot medium at least in the late stage in heavy ion collisions . in spite of the simplicity of the model eq .",
    "( [ eq : dme ] ) , it is thus expected that the model qualitatively well describes the time evolution of @xmath42 in the hadronic stage .",
    "now , let us determine the time evolution of cumulants for the stochastic process eq .",

    "in this study , we employed a simple model , eq .  ( [ eq : dme ] ) , to investigate the time evolution of non - gaussian fluctuations .",
    "the model is expected to describe well the qualitative feature of the diffusion of higher order cumulants in the hadronic stage as already discussed . in order to explore the diffusion in each stage in heavy ion collisions",
    "more quantitatively , however , one must take various effects into account . in the present model , for example ,",
    "fluctuations in equilibrium are given by the poisson or skellam distribution as a result of the absence of interactions between each brownian particle .",
    "the model thus is not suitable to describe systems where equilibrated fluctuations do not follow either of these distributions .",
    "the easiest way to treat non - poissonian fluctuations is to consider a system composed of several particle species having different charges which separately follow eq .",
    "( [ eq : dme ] ) .",
    "the fluctuations of total charge of all particle species then becomes neither poissonian nor skellam distribution .",
    "this modification would be used as a first approximation to model the non - skellam behavior of the net - electric charge fluctuations . when the non - poissonian behavior comes from interaction between particles , terms describing the interaction",
    "should be introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dme ] ) .",
    "next , the model eq .",
    "( [ eq : dme ] ) describes a markov process and the stochastic effect does not have temporal correlations . to take account of nonzero temporal correlations ,",
    "the model should be extended to non - markov ones .",
    "such a treatment would be required in , for example , dealing with the non - gaussianity associated with critical phenomena and considering phenomena of the time scale of microscopic interaction . in the present study",
    ", it is also assumed that the numbers of two particle species @xmath72 and @xmath73 which carry opposite charges are separately conserved . while this assumption would be well justified for baryon numbers after chemical freezeout",
    ", effects of pair - creation and annihilation of electric charges would modify the time evolution of the net - electric charge fluctuations qualitatively . finally , whereas the system investigated in the present study corresponds to the one with fixed diffusion constant @xmath18 , @xmath11 dependence of this parameter",
    "should also be taken into account especially when one investigates the expanding system @xcite .",
    "besides these technical issues on the model , several assumptions also have been introduced on the geometry of the system and initial condition .",
    "to simplify the arguments , in the present letter we limited our attention to the system which is infinitely long and the event - by - event configuration of the initial distribution is uniform and local , and thus satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : locality ] ) . the hot medium created by heavy ion collisions , on the other hand , is a finite system , and the effects of global charge conservation and the violation of boost invariance modify the values of the fluctuation observables @xcite and render them dependent on the position of the rapidity window .",
    "the validity of locality condition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : locality ] ) should also be investigated carefully . to investigate these effects , the model eq .",
    "( [ eq : dme ] ) has to be solved with appropriate boundary conditions and various initial conditions .",
    "part of these issues will be investigated in the forthcoming paper @xcite .    in the present study ,",
    "we limited our attention to sufficiently large @xmath9 , where the measurement of odd order cumulants are difficult owing to their smallness . on the other hand , in the range of @xmath9 where the beam energy scan program at rhic is exploring , the third order cumulants are also observable @xcite and will carry significant information on the qcd phase transition @xcite .",
    "the time evolution and @xmath3 dependence of the third - order cumulants will also be discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present letter , we investigated the time evolution of non - gaussian fluctuations of conserved charges in a volume through diffusion using the diffusion master equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : dme ] ) , which is intended to model the time evolution of higher order cumulants of conserved charges @xmath96 and @xmath97 in the hadronic stage of relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "our analysis shows that the fourth - order cumulant @xmath7 is suppressed compared with the second - order one @xmath119 , provided that the suppression of @xmath115 at alice @xcite is a consequence of the survival of the smallness of the fluctuation at the primordial stage .",
    "the same conclusion is also anticipated for baryon number cumulants .",
    "it should , however , be noted that this result qualitatively depends on the parameter @xmath111 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c ] ) , which is not constrained only by the local charge conservation and sensitive to hadronization mechanism .",
    "we emphasize that the fourth - order cumulants of net - electric charge and baryon numbers , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , can be observable as functions of @xmath3 in the mid - rapidity region in heavy ion collisions at lhc and rhic .",
    "the comparison of the experimental data on various cumulants with the present analysis will reveal the dynamical evolution of fluctuations and hadronization mechanism in heavy ion collisions .",
