    "this article is devoted to study holomorphy by means of integral - geometric tools .",
    "briefly , the problem which is studied here can be formulated as follows : given a real submanifold of a complex manifold , is it possible to detect a complex structure on the manifold in terms of zero moment conditions on a family of closed curves covering the manifold ?",
    "the starting point for this article were the works of the author @xcite .",
    "there , two open problems , mentioned in the abstract , were solved in real - analytic case .",
    "these problems concern characterization of holomorphic functions in a planar domain and characterization of boundary values of holomorphic functions in a domain in @xmath3 in terms of complex moment conditions on closed curves .    in this article",
    "we show that both problems , after being reformulated in terms of the graphs of the functions , become just two special cases of a more general problem of deriving lower bounds for cr dimensions of real manifolds in @xmath8 from the moment conditions on families of closed curves .",
    "solution of the latter problem appeared to be intimately related to a generalization of the classical argument principle , from a single holomorphic mappings to varieties of those .",
    "we prove this generalization , which we call parametric argument principle , and then show how it leads to solutions of the above mentioned problems about cr functions and manifolds , and of more general results .",
    "we will be denoting @xmath9-the unit complex disc and @xmath10 - the unit circle .",
    "let @xmath11 be an analytic function in the open unit disc @xmath12 of the class @xmath13 in the closed disc @xmath14 the classical argument principle states that for any complex number @xmath15 the following identity holds @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the number of zeros , counting multiplicities , of the function @xmath18 in @xmath1 and @xmath19 stands for the winding ( rotation ) number of a curve @xmath5 with respect to the point @xmath20 the winding number @xmath21 is defined as the change of argument of @xmath22 along the unit circle @xmath23 divided by @xmath24 , and can be evaluated via logarithmic residue : @xmath25    notice that if @xmath11 is holomorphic in the closed unit disc then @xmath26 is allowed to have ( isolated ) zeros on the unit circle @xmath27 .",
    "the multiplicities of the boundary zeros contribute to @xmath17 with the factor @xmath28    a generalization of the argument principle to mappings to @xmath8 addresses to linking numbers , or linking coefficients ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which generalize the notion of winding number . by definition ,",
    "the linking number of a closed curve @xmath5 and a @xmath29-manifold @xmath30 disjoint from @xmath5 , equals the sum of intersection indices of @xmath31 and @xmath32 and equals zero if @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a 2-chain bounded by @xmath35 the fundamental fact is that if @xmath34 and @xmath31 are holomorphic , then the intersection indices are positive ( cf.@xcite , p.62 ) and therefore the linking number equals to the number of intersection points , counting multiplicities : @xmath36 also , if @xmath31 is given as the null variety of a holomorphic function , @xmath37 then the linking number can be computed via the logarithmic residue formula : @xmath38    the facts that the intersection indices are positive and , correspondingly , the linking numbers coincide with the number of intersection points , can be regarded as a general form of the argument principle .",
    "we are interested in the following corollary , which can be viewed as a weak form of the argument principle .",
    "( corollary of argument principle)[p : argument_principle ] let @xmath39 be @xmath13-mapping , holomorphic in @xmath40 if @xmath41 , then @xmath42 , i.e. @xmath43    it is instructive to see the proof of that fact .",
    "first , we prove that the images of the unit circle and of the unit disc coincide : @xmath44 this will imply that @xmath43 indeed , otherwise @xmath45 for some @xmath46 and then the image of @xmath47 near @xmath48 is a two - dimensional manifold , while @xmath49 is at most one - dimensional .",
    "if , on the contrary , @xmath50 then there exists a point @xmath51 since smooth curves in @xmath8 are rationally convex ( e.g. , @xcite , theorem 2.7 ) , there exists a polynomial @xmath52 in @xmath8 such that @xmath53 but @xmath54 for @xmath55    since the image @xmath56 is homologically trivial , then @xmath57 where @xmath58 on the other hand , the intersection @xmath59 is nonempty , because it contains the point @xmath60 , and therefore @xmath61 due to the argument principle .",
    "this contradiction completes the proof .",
    "in fact , the crucial condition for the mapping @xmath11 is @xmath62 here @xmath63 means the topological degree of the mapping @xmath64 hence the above statement sounds as follows : _ if @xmath65 is holomorphic in @xmath1 and @xmath66 then @xmath67 _",
    "thus , the classical argument principle implies that if a holomorphic mapping of the unit disc , smooth in its closure , homologically degenerates on the boundary ( the topological degree is zero ) , then it dimensionally degenerates on the interior , meaning that @xmath68 and , correspondingly , the image collapses .",
    "the main goal of this article is to generalize this phenomenon from a single mapping to families of holomorphic mappings .",
    "namely , we consider a variety @xmath69 to @xmath3 real - analytically depending on the parameter @xmath70 this parameter runs over a compact real - analytic connected oriented @xmath71dimensional manifold @xmath72    for the sake of simplicity of the exposition , we resctrict ourselves here by the case when the parametrizing manifold @xmath73 has no boundary ( is closed ) .",
    "the family @xmath74 defines a smooth mapping @xmath75 from @xmath76 to @xmath8 , holomorphic in the variable @xmath77 we will be assuming that the target space has enough room , namely , that @xmath78    we want to understand when the homological degeneracy of the mapping @xmath11 on the boundary @xmath79 implies dimensional degeneracy of @xmath11 in the interior @xmath80 in general terms , the main theorem ( theorem [ t : main ] ) of this article can be formulated as the following    * parametric argument principle : * _ if the mapping @xmath81 holomorphic in @xmath82 homologically degenerates on the boundary @xmath79 but does not homologically degenerate in the interior @xmath83 , then @xmath11 dimensionally degenerates on the whole manifold @xmath84 _    let us explain the terminology and comment on the statement . by homological degeneracy on the boundary",
    "is meant the following :    * condition 1 . *",
    "the induced homomorphism @xmath85 is trivial : @xmath86    by the homological non - degeneracy in the interior is meant the following :    * condition 2 . *",
    "the induced homomorphism @xmath87 is nontrivial : @xmath88 equivalently , this means that the orbit @xmath89 of a point @xmath90 , when the parameter @xmath91 runs the @xmath71 dimensional manifold @xmath92 represents a nonzero class in the @xmath71 dimensional ( @xmath93 ) homology group @xmath94 of the image .",
    "clearly , if the above condition holds for some @xmath95 then it holds for all @xmath96    in order not to make the presentation more complicated , we consider in this article only the case of closed parametrizing manifolds @xmath73 .",
    "the case of manifolds @xmath73 with nonempty boundaries requires considering relative homology groups .    under conditions 1 and 2",
    ", the conclusion is that the rank of the mapping @xmath11 degenerates , i.e. , each point in @xmath97 is critical : @xmath98    * heuristics . *",
    "the phenomenon under discussion might be explained as follows .",
    "condition 1 is the same as in the classical parameter - free version , namely , it requires that the holomorphic mapping @xmath11 is homologically trivial on the boundary of the unit disc @xmath40    condition 2 rules out the parameter factor .",
    "namely , condition 2 of the homological non - degeneracy in the interior excludes the possibility that the boundary homological degeneracy occurs due to the parameter @xmath91 , and results in becoming the holomorphic variable @xmath99 the main player .",
    "this triggers the argument principle for holomorphic mappings and consequently leads to falling down the rank of the mapping and , correspondingly , to the collapse of the image , as in the parameter - free case .",
    "let us illustrate this idea one the following model situation .    * a model example .",
    "*    let @xmath100 be a mapping of the solid torus @xmath101 into itself such that @xmath102 is holomorphic with respect to @xmath103    condition 2 says that for @xmath104 the orbit @xmath105 is a homologically nontrivial loop in @xmath106 on the other hand , condition 1 requires that the image @xmath107 of the boundary torus represents the zero homology class in @xmath108 since the curves @xmath109 are homologically nontrivial ( condition 2 ) , the second generator , the curves @xmath110 must be homologically trivial loops in @xmath111 but then , by the argument principle , the holomorphic mappings @xmath112 are constant with respect to @xmath113 therefore , @xmath114 and hence the image collapses , as it is at most one - dimensional .",
    "simple examples show that condition 2 is crucial and can not be dropped .",
    "for instance , take @xmath115 realized as the unit circle @xmath116 in @xmath117 define @xmath118 then @xmath119 the boundary image is @xmath120 $ ] and the induced homomorphism @xmath121 is trivial , so condition 1 holds .",
    "on the other hand , condition 2 is not fullfiled , because @xmath122)=0 $ ] and hence the induced homomorphism of the first homology groups is @xmath123 .",
    "the conclusion also fails since the image @xmath124 $ ] is three dimensional , @xmath125 so that @xmath11 does not degenerate in the sense of the rank .",
    "the geometric applications of theorem [ t : main ] are concerned with characterization of the boundary image @xmath126 which is assumed a real manifold in @xmath127    first of all , for each fixed @xmath91 the image of the unit disc @xmath1 is an analytic disc @xmath128 in @xmath127 this disc is _ attached _ to @xmath129 meaning that @xmath130 moreover , the manifold @xmath131 is fully covered by the closed curves @xmath132    the key point for applications is that the conclusion of theorem [ t : main ] about the degeneracy of the differential @xmath133 means @xmath134 linear dependence in the tangent spaces to @xmath135 in turn , this implies that the tangent spaces of @xmath131 contain nontrivial complex subspaces and hence @xmath131 possesses a partial holomorphic ( cr ) structure .",
    "thus , speaking in geometric terms , theorem [ t : main ] characterizes such varieties of analytic discs which induce cr , i.e. , partially complex , structure on a real manifold in @xmath3 swept by the boundaries of the discs",
    ". moreover , it appears possible to estimate the dimension of the above cr structure ( cr dimension ) in terms of the properties of the varieties of attached analytic discs .",
    "an alternative , analytic , interpretation of the result is as follows .",
    "since @xmath136 for any closed curve , that bounds an analytic disc , and for each holomorphic 1-form @xmath137 the above application can be regarded as a _ version of morera theorem for manifolds_. namely , it detects holomorphic structure on @xmath131 from complex moment conditions @xmath136 on a family of closed curves @xmath5 covering @xmath135    the discussed result about estimating cr dimension leads to solutions , in real - analytic category , of number or problems which turned out special cases of the above mentioned morera - type theorem for manifolds .",
    "in fact , just attempts to solve those problem had led the author to parametric argument principle which appears to be in a core of the problems .",
    "let us describe those applications .",
    "* strip - problem .",
    "*    the first problem , called strip - problem , concerns morera - like characterization of analytic functions of one complex variables . in the general setting it sounds as follows .",
    "let @xmath138 be a 1-parameter family of jordan curves in the complex plane .",
    "let @xmath0 be a continuous function on @xmath139 .",
    "suppose that all complex moments on the curves @xmath138 vanish : @xmath140 for all values of the parameter @xmath70 must @xmath0 be holomorphic in @xmath141    the moment condition is known to be equivalent to existence of holomorphic extension of the function @xmath0 from any curve @xmath138 to the jordan domain @xmath142 bounded by @xmath132 the main question is when these extensions agree on intersections and thus @xmath0 is holomorphic on @xmath141 the name `` strip - problem '' comes from the original formulation of the problem , where @xmath138 were the circles inscribed in a given strip .",
    "clearly , not any family of jordan curves test holomorphicity in the above sense .",
    "for example , the family of circles @xmath143 does not , since the function @xmath144 extends holomorphically from each such circle ( as a constant ) but is not holomorphic .",
    "so , the problem is to characterize those families which do test holomorphic functions .",
    "the strip - problem has quite long history and bibliography ( see the survey @xcite ) . in the articles @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite",
    "essentially two situations have been considered and solved till recently : 1 ) the case of rotation invariant families of curves ( this assumption makes methods of fourier series applicable ) , 2 ) the case of circles .",
    "however , even for group - invariant families of circles , in the case of non - compact groups ( e.g.,translations along a line ) the problem was open for a long time .",
    "relatively recently , the problem has been pushed forward due to reformulating it as a problem in @xmath145 .",
    "this approach was used in @xcite to solve the problem for rational , with respect to the real variables , functions and for generic families of circles",
    ". then bringing tools of cr theory led a. tumanov to a complete solution for the case of families of circles @xcite .",
    "a crucial condition on a family of circles was that they surround no common point .",
    "in full generality , for generic families of jordan curves , though under assumptions of real analyticity , the strip - problem was solved by the author in @xcite .",
    "it was proved that for any regular real - analytic family of jordan curves , surrounding _ no common point _ , the strip - problem has positive answer .",
    "the proof was based on topological ideas related to the argument principle , so that the concept of parametric argument principle was implicitly present in @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that certain hints to topological nature of the problem appeared already in tumanov s paper @xcite where such tools as indices of the curves were exploited .",
    "we present here the results of @xcite , as well as their generalizations to @xmath8 ( corollary [ c:4.2 ] , corollary [ c : n - dim - strip ] ) , as a corollary of the parametric argument principle , proved in this article .    * globevnik - stout conjecture * the second problem that served as a motivation for this article is globevnik - stout conjecture @xcite .",
    "it is similar to the strip - problem , but is formulated in higher dimensions and concerns testing boundary values of holomorphic functions , or more generally , cr functions .",
    "the question goes back to the work of of nagel and rudin @xcite where they proved that a continuous function @xmath0 on the unit sphere in @xmath8 extends holomorphically in the unit ball @xmath146 if @xmath0 possesses holomorphic extension into each complex line tangent to a fixed ball contained in @xmath146 .",
    "the conjecture in @xcite was that the result generalizes for the case of two arbitrary enclosed domains @xmath147 .",
    "partial results were obtained for open families of complex lines @xcite , @xcite , or for complex geodesics in kobayashi metric @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "the globevnik - stout conjecture was proved in real - analytic category , even in a much broader formulation .",
    "namely , the conjecture was proved for general families of attached analytic discs , of which the family of complex lines tangent to a given surface is a particular case . in this article , we present a proof of even more general statement ( theorem [ t : g_s ] ) , as a corollary of the results we are going to describe next .",
