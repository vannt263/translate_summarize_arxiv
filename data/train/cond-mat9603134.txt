    "in a series of seminal pioneering papers fortuin and kasteleyn @xcite established an important connection between percolation problems and the related concept of clusters on the one hand and various thermodynamic functions of potts spin models on the other .",
    "these connections allow geometric interpretation of different properties of these systems , that play a central role in their critical behavior .",
    "for example , the onset of spontaneous magnetization coincides with the appearance of an infinite cluster in the related percolation problem ; the susceptibility is proportional to the mean cluster size , and the correlation length to a typical cluster s radius .",
    "some years later swendsen and wang ( sw ) @xcite used these ideas in a way that constituted a breakthrough in a different sub - field of statistical physics : that of computer simulations of systems in thermal equilibrium",
    ". they exploited the fourtuin - kasteleyn mapping to define a very efficient monte carlo algorithm that performs large scale non - local moves , by flipping simultaneously entire clusters of spins .",
    "this dynamics decreases the relaxation time to equilibrium while preserving detailed balance and ergodicity . in this way one can overcome ( or at least significantly reduce ) critical slowing down at second order phase transitions @xcite .",
    "`` critical slowing down '' is a well known phenomenon ; the relaxation time of a system diverges as the critical point is approached .",
    "the manifestation of this _ real , physical _ effect on simulations is that at criticality the typical time needed to produce a large set of decorrelated configurations , that appear with the proper boltzmann weight , diverges with the system s size . hence the standard local metropolis - type monte - carlo simulation methods become inefficient .",
    "a wide variety of cluster methods have been applied successfully to many fields in physics ( second - order phase transitions , disordered and frustrated systems , quantum field theories , fermions in a gauge background , quantum gravity and more @xcite ) . in many cases a dramatic acceleration of convergence to equilibrium was achieved .",
    "that is , if the simulation of a system of ( linear ) size @xmath3 is performed at the critical point , the relaxation time behaves according to    @xmath4 where @xmath5 , the exponent associated with the cluster algorithm is significantly less than @xmath6 of the local methods .",
    "so far only relatively few rigorous results have been derived for cluster algorithms and the associated relaxation times and exponents @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the well known version of the ising spin model for which mean field is the exact solution ; that of @xmath7 spins , all connected to each other . by analyzing this system",
    "one can calculate the classical , mean - field value of @xmath5 .",
    "the mean - field ising ferromagnet has been previously examined analytically and numerically by ray , tamayo and klein ( rtk ) @xcite .",
    "although the work presented here agrees with the conclusions of rtk regarding the sw dynamics , it contains some improvement .",
    "firstly , the derivation of the analytical results is improved , employing the known exact results of erds et .",
    "@xcite for highly diluted random graphs , instead of the approximation ( used by rtk ) of a bethe lattice with large coordination number .",
    "we show that this technical improvement does not alter the results obtained @xcite for sw dynamics .",
    "secondly , we performed simulations , introducing a new efficient algorithm , which extend those of rtk in the following aspects .",
    "rtk looked at the relaxation times @xmath8 of the magnetization autocorrelation function , measured at a single temperature ( @xmath0 of the infinite system ) versus the size of the system .",
    "in addition they also studied the temperature dependence of @xmath8 below @xmath0 at a single value of the system size .",
    "our simulations were done on larger systems using longer running times ; in addition , we studied a wide range of system sizes and temperatures both above and below @xmath0 .",
    "our analysis of the results is based on finite size scaling ; the relaxation times measured at various temperatures and system sizes are presented using data collapse , thereby also calculating numerically the corresponding finite size scaling function .",
    "this data collapse of course takes into account the shift in the transition temperature as a function of the size of the system .",
    "it resolves the unexpected result which rtk found puzzling , namely that the slowing down below the transition appeared to be enhanced in comparison to that at the transition .",
    "when the shift in the transition temperature is properly accounted for , this effect disappears .",
    "in addition , we present analytical and numerical results for wolff ( uw ) @xcite dynamics with the conclusion that the relaxation times of the autocorrelation function depends on the details of the global algorithm .",
    "however , the upper critical dimension is hypothesized to be unaffected by the details of the local or the global algorithm .",
    "the hamiltonian of the fully connected ising model is defined by    @xmath9    the statics of this model is solved exactly , using mean - field @xcite .",
    "the result is a second order phase transition at @xmath10 , with exponents @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the local ( single spin flip ) dynamics of this model can also be solved exactly using a mean - field approach resulting in ( from here we use @xmath15 unless otherwise stated ) @xmath16 using the fact that @xmath17 ( i.e. @xmath18 ) , it is clear that @xmath19 , giving @xmath20    the standard sw procedure as implemented for this model is defined as follows .",
    "let us assume that the system is in a spin configuration @xmath21 , @xmath22 . in each sw sweep",
    "every bond is `` activated '' ( or frozen ) with probability @xmath23 a bond that is not frozen is called `` deleted '' .",
    "frozen bonds define connected clusters , to each of which a spin value ( @xmath24 ) is now assigned randomly , giving rise to the new spin configuration",
    ". then the procedure is repeated .",
    "the dynamics of this sw procedure was first studied for the fully - connected model by ray et al @xcite , who showed that @xmath25 .",
    "we present now a different derivation of this result - one which utilizes exact results from graph theory .    in order to get better insight into the percolation properties of the fully connected model",
    "let us introduce a few previously known facts about highly diluted graphs @xcite .",
    "these are relevant to our problem since for @xmath26 the freezing probability @xmath27 is very small , and the sw procedure generates precisely the highly diluted graphs to which we now turn .    consider a graph of @xmath28 nodes ; on all links connecting pairs of nodes @xmath29 place independent random variables @xmath30 , taken from the probability distribution @xmath31 where the average connectivity @xmath32 is taken to be @xmath33 .    the resulting highly diluted graph has finite connectivity ; in the thermodynamic limit the probability that a node has connectivity @xmath34 ( i.e. has non - vanishing link variables @xmath30 with @xmath34 other nodes ) follows the poisson distribution : @xmath35    many geometric properties of this diluted graph are well understood@xcite . in particular ,",
    "the graph undergoes a percolation transition at @xmath36 .",
    "that is , the number of nodes that belong to the largest connected cluster is of order @xmath37 for @xmath38 , @xmath39 at @xmath36 , and of @xmath40 for @xmath41 . in this percolating regime",
    "the size of the largest cluster is @xmath42 , where the parameter @xmath43 is the solution of the equation @xcite @xmath44    or @xmath45 assuming that for @xmath46 and @xmath47 one has @xmath48 we get @xmath49 and therefore @xmath50 which yields @xmath51    after this aside on random dilute graphs we return to the sw dynamics for our fully connected ising spin model .",
    "since the spins are fully connected , a configuration is fully parametrized by @xmath52 , the number of positive valued spins , or by its magnetization @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "the dynamics is , therefore , completely characterized by specifying the value of either @xmath52 or @xmath55 after each monte carlo sweep .",
    "every @xmath56 sweep can be thought of as consisting of two steps . in the first step",
    "the spins are divided into two groups , one of positive spins ( all the spins with @xmath57 ) and the other negative ( spins with @xmath58 ) .",
    "using @xmath27 of ( [ pf ] ) we first note that all the links connecting any positive spin to any negative one are deleted .",
    "the positive ( negative ) group contains @xmath59 spins . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath60 .    in the second step , each group is examined independently .",
    "the internal links within a group are `` activated '' with the probability @xmath61 .",
    "each group can be thought of now as a random graph with effective connectivity    @xmath62    denoting by @xmath63 the deviation from criticality : @xmath64 ( recall that @xmath65 ) we can write for the larger ( positive ) group of spins @xmath66    we can now view the act of freezing a bond as choosing @xmath67 in the generation of the dilute graph discussed above . for that problem , as was mentioned previously , @xmath36 is a critical value .",
    "therefore in the disordered phase of our spin model @xmath68 and @xmath69 so that both @xmath70 and the sw freeze - delete procedure creates only small ( non - macroscopic ) clusters . on the other hand , at temperatures just below criticality , i.e. when @xmath71 , we have @xmath72 but @xmath73 .",
    "hence only _ one _ macroscopic cluster ( of positive spins ) , whose size is proportional to the lattice size , is generated , while the rest of the clusters are small .",
    "flipping of this single macroscopic cluster is the dominant element of the dynamics .",
    "the rest of the clusters are small , there are @xmath40 of them , and therefore the extent that their flip influences the magnetization is negligible compared to that of the big cluster .    in what follows we derive recursion for @xmath74 and @xmath75 , the values that the number of the majority spins and the magnetization take after @xmath76 steps of the sw procedure",
    "we use the notation @xmath52 , but mean the number of spins in the state with majority ( even when they are negative ) .",
    "the small clusters become @xmath77 with probability @xmath78 after a sweep : neglecting fluctuations of their contribution , and assuming that the single large spanning cluster was and remains positive , we can write    @xmath79+n_+^lg(c_+)\\ ] ]    @xmath80 . \\label{nsw}\\ ] ]    denoting @xmath81 equations ( 7 - 8 ) can be rewritten as a recursion for the magnetization : @xmath82 . \\label{ml1}\\ ] ] for simplicity we keep @xmath83 positive ( or , in other words , our recursion is actually for @xmath84 ) .",
    "near the transition the argument of the function @xmath43 is near its critical value and we can identify @xmath85 ( see eq .",

    "for @xmath71 eq .",
    "( [ dif ] ) has a stationary point at @xmath90 near this point we write @xmath91 and linearize equation ( [ dif ] ) in @xmath92 :    @xmath93    for @xmath94 the @xmath95 term is dominant so one can conclude that relaxation is dominated by @xmath96},\\ ] ] and therefore in the ordered phase we find the relaxation time @xmath97 using the definition @xmath98 yields our result for the mean field value of the dynamic exponent of the swendsen - wang procedure : @xmath99",
    "the standard version @xcite of the sw algorithm visits , during a single sweep , each bond once and takes a freeze / delete decision  @xcite .",
    "the fully connected system ( eq . [ mfe ] ) contains @xmath28 spins and @xmath100 links ; consequently the usual sw algorithm requires @xmath101 operations for one sweep of the system . for our choice of @xmath27",
    "( eq . [ pf ] ) , however , only a very small fraction of bonds is eventually frozen : even though every spin has @xmath102 links , only @xmath103 are activated .",
    "moreover , as explained in the introduction , in the fully connected model the only relevant parameter that determines the system s state is its magnetization , or @xmath52 .",
    "hence to get the new configuration _",
    "after _ the sw sweep , all we have to determine is the new value of @xmath52 . to do this",
    "we do not have to scan all @xmath102 bonds of a certain spin ; rather , when the algorithm `` visits '' a new spin that belongs to a cluster , it suffice to use the binomial distribution to determine the * number * of activated bonds it has ( i.e. the number of new members of the cluster ) .    therefore the sw algorithm can be implemented for the fully connected model by manipulating a few _ numbers _ , instead of the values taken by the spins .",
    "this approach simplifies the algorithm , is much more efficient , and uses a very small memory .",
    "+ we adopted the spirit of the wolff algorithm to grow all sw clusters during a sweep . at a given moment",
    "we know the number of spins that have been assigned to our presently growing cluster .",
    "new spins that have been added to the cluster have to be tested for the number of frozen bonds connecting them to _ free _ spins ( that do not yet belong to any cluster and have the same sign as the presently growing cluster and hence are candidates for joining it ) .",
    "the spins that are known to belong to the cluster but have not yet been tested are in a _",
    "`` stack''_. as a cluster is growing , the algorithm tracks and modifies the following parameters :    * @xmath104 * @xmath105 * @xmath106    a sw sweep starts at a configuration with @xmath52 `` up '' spins and @xmath107 `` down '' .",
    "say we start to generate clusters of the up spins .",
    "the following steps are taken :    1 .   assign one spin to the growing cluster : set @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "2 .   test the spin : that is , using the binomial distribution , determine @xmath110 , the number of frozen links our spin will get , connecting it to presently free spins : @xmath111 3 .",

    "construction of the cluster has now been completed .",
    "flip the cluster with probability @xmath119 .",

    "reset @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 and repeat @xmath124 to construct new clusters , until there are no more free spins ( @xmath125 )",
    "go to the second component ( of down spins ) and apply @xmath126 with @xmath107 .",
    "note that now when the cluster flips the magnetization _",
    "increases _ by @xmath127 .",
    "note that * all * the operations of our algorithm are on a few _ numbers _ , namely we do not really define spins , just manipulate a few counters that were defined above .",
    "for the wolff version one can apply the same algorithm and grow only the first cluster ; the decision of starting it from an up or down spin as seed is done at random ( with probability proportional to the number of up / down spins ) .      finite size scaling is a standard method @xcite to extract critical indices from numerical data obtained by simulating finite systems of linear size @xmath3 .",

    "the reason for this choice is that in finite systems , especially with cluster dynamics , the quantity @xmath146 has no peak at all and the measured value increases monotonically as t decreases .",
