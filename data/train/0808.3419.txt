    "one of our most crucial questions about nature at present is : what is dark energy ?",
    "the fact that our universe is accelerating @xcite and that dark energy constitutes about @xmath5 of the total energy density of the universe , are well established by now .",
    "many theoretical models have been put forth which cast dark energy in the form of a cosmic fluid @xcite with time variations in its equation of state @xmath6 .",
    "yet the simplest explanation for dark energy remains to be a pure cosmological constant ( cc ) @xmath7 .",
    "the trouble we face in understanding dark energy does not stem from a shortage of dark energy models , with @xmath8 , that mimick at present the behavour of @xmath7 and give rise to the observed acceleration of the universe .",
    "the puzzle rather lies on identifying which one of these possible candidates is the correct one .",
    "the best way to discriminate among the various possibilites and a pure @xmath9 , @xmath7 , is to experimentally measure the time variations of the dark energy equation of state @xmath6 .",
    "so far a popular parametrization for @xmath6 is the linear one @xmath10 with @xmath11 for a pure _ cc _ @xcite .",
    "a knowledge of @xmath6 is crucial for not only understanding the present accelerated expansion of the universe but also for making predictions for its future evolution and destiny . if @xmath12 then dark energy is a phantom @xcite which leads the universe to a big rip in the future . if @xmath13 then we are probably @xcite facing an eternal desitter state @xcite which at least at the classical level implies constant temperature and entropy therefore a cosmic heat death @xcite",
    ". other forms of @xmath6 can also allow for a big crunch @xcite or bounces @xcite .",
    "at present we can not infer which destiny our universe will meet without a better knowldege of @xmath6 .",
    "major experimental efforts for pinning down the value and time - variations of @xmath6 are under way through large scale surveys from cmb @xcite , large scale structure @xcite , and sn1a observations .",
    "the endeavor of measuring , to confident precision , such small time variations in @xmath6 has proven extremely difficult , partly due to the inherited errors in the experiments that are not instrumental but which originate from noise accumulated from the background and foreground effects through which the signal we receive has propagated . in order to minimize such errors associated with the propagation of the signal through the vastness of structure in the universe",
    ", we would like to propose in this letter a complimentary method for measuring @xmath6 .",
    "this method uses compact and localized objects , such as black holes , for acquiring information about @xmath6 , by exploiting the gravitational waves these objects emit when they are in binaries .",
    "the advantage of this method is twofold : first , gravitational waves propagate undisturbed through structure ; and second , we have existing experiments which are either already operational or will be in the near future , such as ligo and lisa missions designed to detect these binaries gravitational waves , or chandra and vlba experiments designed for x - ray and radio measurements .    the accretion of dark energy by black holes is reviewed in sec.2 . , including a review of the main parameters of binaries and gravitational waves , useful for our purposed .",

    "sbh s can be produced via dark matter accretion @xcite and they can have a mass as large as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a solar mass .",
    "most active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are populated by sbh s therefore we can expect that sbh binaries are not that uncommon .",

[ effectivemass ] is : @xmath43 , and the expression eqn.[power ] for the power of the emitted gravitational waves ( gw ) , becomes      since the binary is immersed in the bath of dark energy with energy density @xmath45 , the mass of each hole in the binary will change according to eqns.[bhmass ] , [ bhsol ] , due to the accretion of dark energy      here @xmath6 denotes the equation of state of dark energy at redshift @xmath18 , and @xmath47 the mass of the star at initial time @xmath48 .",

    "but the other two terms are new and completely due to the dark energy accretion by black holes .",

    "for this reason , we focus on the large mass limit below and show that the dark energy correction terms to the orbit , eqn .",
    "[ neworbit2 ] , are significant and even dominant for sbh s binaries with @xmath69 or larger .",
    "all the information about dark energy is contained in @xmath70 which is positive for all dark energy models with @xmath71 . for the case of a pure cosmological constant ( cc ) , @xmath72 , and",

    "the correction term due to dark energy in eqn.[neworbit1 ] , in the case of phantom dark energy , thus has the opposite sign to the third ( hulse - taylor ) term that originates from power losses due to emission of gravitational waves .",
    "the sensitivity of the binary to the dark energy eos @xmath6 is now clear : orbital changes of a binary immersed in phantom energy @xmath73 increase the separation and , are quite different from the orbital changes in the case of dark energy with @xmath74 which accelerate the merging , or the case @xmath75 where no changes of the orbit are induced from dark energy . as shown below , this result",
    "is used to deduce whether dark energy is a cc , a phantom or whether @xmath0 lies above the cc boundary @xmath76 .",
    "ligo is designed to detect signals in the range @xmath90 and amplitudes @xmath86 around @xmath91 , with its optimum detection at frequencies @xmath92 @xcite , while lisa will be able to see as far as @xmath93 .",
    "one such example of an optimum signal for ligo @xcite would be a black hole binary with parameters : @xmath94 .",
    "although most of the sbh s binaries , in which the dark energy correction term @xmath95 is dominant , do not initially fall within the frequency detection limits of _ ligo _ , they can still be detected during the time close to merging , since their frequency evolves as      if , for example , we estimate the orbital changes during a time @xmath97 with @xmath98 the hubble constant due to both correction terms , then the orbital separation of a binary with initial frequency @xmath99 , @xmath100 will lately be @xmath101 , i.e. it will fall within the detection limits .",
    "it can be shown that the first correction term in eq.[neworbit2 ] is roughly @xmath102 times the second correction term , therefore small enough to the second correction term that it can safely be neglected .",
    "the interesting part in eq.[neworbit2 ] is the comparison between the second correction term @xmath95 which is the new term derived in this letter and is due to the dark energy bath , and the third correction term @xmath103 that has already been known and is solely due to the power losses from gw emission .",
    "hereon , we include only the second term , @xmath95 , referred to as the dark energy term , and the third term , @xmath103 , referred to as the gw ( hulse - taylor ) term .                from eqs.[y1]-[ratio ]",
    ", we can see that the correction term due to dark energy @xmath95 can be as large as the previously known gw ( hulse - taylor ) correction term @xmath103 , or even dominant in some cases , for supermassive black holes @xmath109 and for large orbital separation @xmath80 .",
    "would have merged if dark energy lies above the cc boundary , @xmath111 ; or split apart for phantom dark energy @xmath112 . from those , from eqn .",

    "so , eqn . [ condition ] seems to provide a cutoff for sbh s binaries , which heavily depends on the type of dark energy and whether dark energy lies below or above the cc - boundary of @xmath115_. in general , measurements of @xmath57 $ ] can reveal the equation of state of dark energy @xmath1 , via the eqns .",
    "[ y2]-[ratio ] , and binaries that fall under the category of eqn .",
    "[ condition ] , can immediately reveal whether dark energy is a phantom or not . for the other sbh s binaries ,",
    "this information is deduced from      considering that the total mass in the universe is @xmath117 , then the rough number of sbh s is around @xmath118 or one sbh for @xmath119 .",
    "if we assume that most of them are in binaries , then eqn . [ condition ] implies that if dark energy is a phantom then we should find twice as many sbh s with separation larger than @xmath120 as compared to the number of sbh s we would find if dark energy is @xmath121 for which case many of them would have merged to create even heavier sbh s .      for a binary with @xmath122 that correspond to an orbit @xmath123 and period of rotation @xmath124 , the gw correction term is of the order @xmath125 while the dark energy correction term is @xmath126 . in this example",
    "the correction term due to dark energy is many orders of magnitude larger than the gw correction and results in a net orbital change of @xmath127 during a hubble time .",
    "it is important to point out in this example that if dark energy is a phantom then @xmath95 has a positive sign , while @xmath128 . since @xmath129 then the merging of the two stars in the binary would not occur , due to the effect of the phantom energy dominating over and compensating for the gw power losses .",
    "in fact , since @xmath57 $ ] increases in this case eq.[neworbit2 ] , the stars in the binary would be ripped apart over time . the lifetime of the stars @xmath23 is equal to the big rip time in the phantom energy case and therefore larger then the characteristic times of the system , @xmath130 and , it is larger than @xmath131 , where @xmath131 is defined as the time when @xmath132 \\ge r_0 $ ] .",
    "but , if dark energy is not a phantom or a cc @xmath7 , then the dark energy corrections accelerate the merging process and for @xmath133 dominate it , since in this case @xmath134 . by measuring the change in the orbital separation , using gw observations with _",
    "ligo _ and _ lisa _ or radio measurements with _ vlba _ , we can deduce whether @xmath1 is positive or negative , since for this class of sbh s binaries , the dark energy corection term @xmath134 dominates the orbital changes .",
    "however , the frequency @xmath135 at initial times @xmath48 of this binary is not within the ligo or lisa limits of detection .",
    "yet , we can use @xmath58 or radio frequency measurements with chandra @xcite to detect changes in the phases of signals emitted from the sbh s binary .",
    "let us look at a more extreme class of binaries that satisfy : @xmath136 .",
    "we have @xmath137 , @xmath138 for @xmath139 .",
    "the initial frequency is @xmath140 and for non - phantom dark energy @xmath121 , during @xmath141 we have @xmath142 , therefore @xmath143 falls within current detection limit .",
    "if dark energy is a phantom the orbit would be ripped apart by that amount , then the frequency would be extremely small and with no chance of detection .",
    "\\i ) the first example is:_galaxy 0402 + 379 _ observed in 2007 with _",
    "vlba _ which has the following parameters , @xmath144 .",
    "this binary thus has a frequency @xmath145 too small for ligo detection and amplitude @xmath146 .",
    "the orbital corrections due to gw radiation @xmath103 and dark energy accretion @xmath95 differ by two orders of magnitude , @xmath147 resulting in an orbital change of @xmath148 during each period of rotation , @xmath149 .",
    "since the time the signal was emitted from the binary , @xmath150 , the orbit has changed by @xmath151 due to the gw ( hulse - taylor ) term @xmath103 , and by @xmath152 due to the dark energy accretion term @xmath95 .",
    "thus the merging time for this binary , if the dark energy effect is ignored , is about another @xmath153 since the time the emitted signal @xmath154 was received . included the effect of dark energy accretion results in a merging time @xmath155 for @xmath111 , which is roughly two orders of magnitude less then the standard estimate .",
    "if @xmath156 then merging can not occur since @xmath95 splitting the stars apart for this case , is two orders of magnitude larger than @xmath103 which is trying to induce merging .",
    "the evolution lifetime of each star in this binary is many orders of magnitude larger than the characteristic merging scale , @xmath157 .",
    "the latter illustrates the fact that while mass changes due to dark energy accretion by individual sbh s are too small to give rise to detection , a binary of sbh s can yield information on dark energy which is easily accessible by our current and near future experiments .",
    "it is quite amazing that we can obtain such a wealth of information on the mysterious dark energy in the universe by using local objects such as sbh s binaries , and experiments that were not initially designed for dark energy detection , such as _ ligo , lisa , vlba and chandra _ experiments .",
    "this binary s separation as a function of time and @xmath0 is plotted in fig.1 , for the cases when dark energy effects @xmath95 are taken into account , ( fig.1 ) ; when only gw effects to the orbit , @xmath103 , are accounted for , but the new dark energy effects derived here are not included in calculating @xmath158 $ ] , ( fig.2 ) .",
    "\\ii ) the second example is : _ a radio galaxy oj287 _ observed in 2008 with _ vlba _",
    "@xcite which is suspected to be a binary of two sbh s .",
    "this example is a bit trickier because one star is a lot heavier than the other and their total mass is @xmath159 .",
    "however , although algebraically messy , it is straightforward to estimate the effect of dark energy for this binary by using the expressions of sec.2 for the case @xmath160 and by replacing eqn .",
    "[ masssimple ] in order to derive eqn .",
    "[ neworbit1 ] .",
    "the orbital separation is @xmath161 or equivalently @xmath162 at @xmath48 .",
    "the current period is @xmath163 , and their distance from us @xmath164 .",
    "if we were to approximate this binary with equal mass sbh s each with @xmath165 then we get @xmath166 .",
    "we receive the emitted signal from the distance @xmath35 at a time @xmath167 during which the orbit has changed by a factor @xmath168 due to hulse - taylor gw effect and the dark energy effect respectively .",
    "if dark energy is ignore ( @xmath169 ) , then merging occurs in about @xmath170 . including the effect of dark energy accelerates the merging time by three orders of magnitude for the case @xmath171 or stops merging and rips the stars apart for the case of phantom energy @xmath112 .",
    "as mentioned , binaries are observed with the _ ligo , lisa , vlba , sdss , chandra _ experiments .",
    "it is possible that more sbh s binaries will be found in the near future by these experiments . among other things , the sbh s binary measurements will allow us to distinguish more accurately whether dark energy lies above or below the cc boundary @xmath13 and to pin down the value of @xmath172 $ ] , by making use of the simple method proposed in this letter .",
    "however , the examples discussed here are sufficient to illustrate the power of our method for using sbh binaries to obtain information about dark energy and its equation of state @xmath172 $ ] , even with existing gw and binary data , while avoiding background noise issues , inheritant of the large scale structure in the universe .        by sdss collaboration ( jennifer k. adelman - mccarthy et al .",

    "<S> this letter proposes a new method for measuring the eos of dark energy by using the gravitational waves ( gw ) of black hole binaries . </S>",
    "<S> the method described here offers an alternative to the standard way of large scale surveys .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the mass of a black hole changes due to the accretion of dark energy but at an extremely slow rate . however , a binary of supermassive black holes ( sbh ) radiates gravitational waves with a power proportional to the masses of these accreting stars and thereby carries information on dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> these waves can propagate through the vastness of structure in the universe unimpeded . </S>",
    "<S> the orbital changes of the binary , induced by the energy loss from gravitational radiation , receive a large contribution from dark energy accretion . </S>",
    "<S> this contribution is directly proportional to @xmath1 and is dominant for sbh binaries with separation @xmath2 parsec , thereby accelerating the merging process for @xmath3 or ripping the stars apart for phantom dark energy with @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> such orbital changes , therefore @xmath0 , can be detected with ligo and lisa near merging time , or with x - ray and radio measurements of chandra and vlba experiments . </S>"
