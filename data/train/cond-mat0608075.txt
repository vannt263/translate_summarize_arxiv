    "the preparation and characterization of magnetic nanowires and films is of great interest for the development of advanced microelectronic devices .",
    "therefore , the study of the behavior of magnetic materials in confined geometries , e.g. thin films , has attracted both experimental , see e.g. @xcite , and theoretical , see e.g. @xcite , attention . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", most of the work has been devoted to the study of equilibrium properties of thin magnetic films @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the aim of this work is to study the properties of thin magnetic film growth under far - from - equilibrium conditions . within this context , a useful model for the study of the growth of magnetic materials",
    "is the so - called magnetic eden model ( mem ) @xcite , based on the well known eden model @xcite .",
    "the latter has become an archetypical growth model due to both its simplicity and interesting properties .",
    "eden growth starts from a single particle called the seed .",
    "one then proceeds to add a new particle on a randomly chosen unoccupied site in the immediate neighborhood ( the perimeter ) of the seed .",
    "the growth process then continues by randomly adding new particles to the perimeter of the previously formed cluster .",
    "although this simple rule leads to the growth of compact clusters filling the euclidean space , the self - affinity that characterizes the behavior of the growing interface is of much interest ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the mem , originally motivated by the study of the structural properties of magnetically textured materials , introduces an additional degree of freedom to the eden model , namely the spin of the added particles @xcite .",
    "more recently , the eden growth of clusters of charged particles has also been studied @xcite .    considering the mem with spins having two possible orientations ( up and down )",
    ", one can start the growth of the spin cluster from a single seed having a predetermined orientation , e.g. a spin up seed , placed at the center of the two - dimensional square lattice , whose sites are labelled by their rectangular coordinates @xmath6 . then",
    ", the mem s growth process consists in adding further spins to the growing cluster taking into account the corresponding interaction energies . by analogy to the classical ising model @xcite one takes @xmath7 as the coupling constant between nearest - neighbor ( nn ) spins @xmath8 and the energy @xmath9 given by    @xmath10    where @xmath11 means that the summation is taken over occupied nn sites . as we are concerned with spin @xmath12 particles , the spins can assume two values , namely @xmath13 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , while previous studies of the mem were mainly devoted to determine the lacunarity exponent and the fractal dimension of the set of parallel oriented spins @xcite , the aim of the present work is to study the growth of mem films using extensive monte carlo simulations . in order to simulate thin film growth ,",
    "our study is performed in confined ( stripped ) geometries which resemble recent experiments where the growth of quasi - one - dimensional strips of fe on a cu(111 ) vicinal surface @xcite and fe on a w(110 ) stepped substratum @xcite have been performed .",
    "also , in a related context , the study of the growth of metallic multilayers have shown a rich variety of new physical phenomena .",
    "particularly , the growth of magnetic layers of ni and co separated by a cu spacer layer has recently been studied @xcite .",
    "another goal of the present work is to compare the results obtained for the mem with the well known behavior of the equilibrium ising model @xcite , an archetypical model in the study of phase transitions in equilibrium magnetic systems .",
    "the ising hamiltonian @xmath14 is given by    @xmath15    where @xmath11 means that the summation runs over all nn sites , @xmath16 is the state of the spin at the site of coordinates @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the coupling constant ( @xmath17 for the ferromagnetic case ) . it should be pointed out that , in spite of the fact that eq.(1 ) and eq.(2 ) are similar , the mem describes the irreversible growth of a magnetic material while the ising model is suitable for the study of a magnetic system under equilibrium conditions , and hence these two models operate under extremely different conditions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we give details on the simulation method , section 3 is devoted to the presentation and discussion of the results , while our conclusions are finally stated in section 4 .",
    "the mem in @xmath18dimensions is studied in the square lattice using a rectangular geometry @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "the location of each site on the lattice is specified through its rectangular coordinates @xmath6 , ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the starting seed for the growing cluster is a column of parallel oriented spins placed at @xmath23 .",
    "as described in the foregoing section , the mem growth occurs by selectively gluing spins at perimeter sites .",
    "it should be noticed that previous studies of the mem were performed using a single spin seed placed at the center of the sample @xcite . in this way , previous simulations that followed this approach",
    "were restricted to rather modest cluster sizes , i.e. containing up to 8000 spins @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the rectangular stripped geometry used in this work is suitable for the simulation of the growth of magnetic films and it also has significant technical advantages .",
    "indeed , when the growing film interface is close to reach the limit of the sample ( @xmath24 ) one simply computes the relevant properties of the irreversibly frozen film s bulk ( in the region where the growing process has definitively stopped ) , and subsequently applies an algorithm such that the interface is shifted towards the lowest possible @xmath25coordinate ( while , at the same time , the useless frozen bulk is erased ) . by repeatedly applying this procedure the growth process",
    "is not limited by the @xmath26value of the lattice . in the present work films having up to @xmath27 spins",
    "have been typically grown .",
    "the described procedure can straightforwardly be extended to higher dimensions .",
    "in fact , we have also studied the mem in @xmath28dimensions employing a @xmath29 geometry ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "each site on the lattice is now identified through the rectangular coordinates @xmath30 , ( @xmath21 , @xmath31 ) , and the starting seed for the growing film is taken to be a plane of @xmath32 parallel oriented spins placed at @xmath23 .",
    "the cutting - and - shifting algorithm is in this case also suitable in order to allow the growing film to acquire particles beyond the @xmath24 limit .",
    "as already mentioned , the growth process of a mem film consists in adding further spins to the growing film taking into account the corresponding interaction energies given by equation ( 1 ) .",
    "a spin is added to the film with a probability proportional to the boltzmann factor @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the total energy change involved .",
    "it should be noted that at each step all sites of the growing perimeter are considered and the probabilities of adding up and down spins to them have to be evaluated .",
    "after proper normalization of the probabilities the growing site and the orientation of the spin are determined through a pseudo - random number generator . throughout this work we set the boltzmann constant equal to unity ( @xmath35 ) , we consider @xmath17 ( i.e. , the ferromagnetic case ) and we take the absolute temperature @xmath36 measured in units of @xmath7 .",
    "magnetic eden films grown on a stripped geometry of finite linear dimension @xmath2 at sufficiently low temperatures show an intriguing behavior that we call spontaneous magnetization reversal .",
    "in fact , we have observed that long clusters are constituted by a sequence of well ordered magnetic domains of average length @xmath3 .",
    "= 3.5 in = 1.6 in    = 3.8 in = 2.6 in    figure 1(a ) shows a snapshot configuration of the @xmath37dimensional mem where the phenomenon of spontaneous magnetization reversal can be recognized . here",
    "the reversal occurring between a domain of spins up ( on the left side ) and other one constituted by spins down ( on the right ) , as well as the interface between both domains , can be clearly observed .",
    "it should be noted that the well known phenomenon of field induced magnetization reversal in thin films @xcite is quite different from the spontaneous reversal reported here . in the present study",
    "the reversal occurs during the growth process and in the absence of any applied magnetic field .",
    "the reported phenomenon is essentially due to the small size of the thin film and it becomes irrelevant in the thermodynamic limit . within our best knowledge this theoretical prediction has not yet been observed experimentally .",
    "however , it will certainly be very interesting to design and carry out suitable experiments in order to observe this phenomenon .",
    "let @xmath4 be the characteristic length for the occurrence of the spontaneous magnetization reversal .",
    "since @xmath38 , we then conclude that the phenomenon has two characteristic length scales , namely @xmath39 and @xmath4 , such that @xmath5 .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows the magnetization profile that corresponds to the spontaneous magnetization reversal shown in figure 1(a ) , where    @xmath40    is the mean column magnetization at the distance @xmath41 from the seed , for a system of linear dimension @xmath2 at temperature @xmath36 . in figure 1(b ) one can clearly observe how abruptly the magnetization drops from @xmath42 to @xmath43 within a characteristic length @xmath4 of the order of @xmath2 .",
    "= 3.9 in = 2.7 in    = 3.8 in = 2.5 in    in order to investigate the dependence of the characteristic domain length @xmath44 on @xmath2 and @xmath36 , let us define @xmath45 as the probability for the formation of a domain of length between @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "clearly , the average domain length @xmath44 mentioned above is the average value of @xmath46 taken over a sufficiently long magnetic film ( i.e. @xmath48 for @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the film s total length ) .",
    "figure 2 shows plots of @xmath45 versus @xmath51 for a fixed lattice size and different values of temperature .",
    "as expected , increasingly long domains tend to show up at lower temperatures .",
    "this behavior can be also observed in the plot of @xmath52 versus @xmath36 shown in the inset of figure 2 .",
    "figure 3 shows a log - linear plot of @xmath53 versus @xmath54 for a fixed temperature and lattice sizes in the range @xmath55 . from this figure",
    "it turns clearly out that the average domain length diverges as we increase the lattice size towards the thermodynamic limit .",
    "therefore , as early anticipate the phenomenon of magnetization reversal is a finite size effect releveant for the growth of magnetig films in confined geometries .    at this point",
    "it is useful to perform a comparison between the results obtained with the mem and the well known behavior of the ising model analyzing the interplay between broken symmetry and finite - size effects at thermal phase transitions . in ordinary thermally",
    "driven phase transitions , the system changes from a disordered state at high temperatures to a spontaneously ordered state at temperatures below some critical value @xmath56 where a second - order phase transition takes place . regarding the equilibrium ising model as the archetypical example , one has that , in the absence of an externally applied magnetic field ( @xmath57 ) , the low temperature ordered phase is a state with non - vanishing spontaneous magnetization ( @xmath58 , the sign depending on the initial state ) .",
    "this spontaneous symmetry breaking is possible in the thermodynamic limit only .",
    "in fact , it is found that the magnetization @xmath59 of a finite sample formed by @xmath60 particles , defined by    @xmath61    can pass with a finite probability from a value near @xmath62 to another near @xmath63 , as well as in the opposite direction .",
    "consequently , the magnetization of a finite system , averaged over a sufficiently large observation time , vanishes at every positive temperature , irrespective of the ( finite ) size of the sample .",
    "the equation @xmath64 holds if the observation time ( @xmath65 ) becomes larger than the ergodic time ( @xmath66 ) , which is defined as the time needed to observe the system passing from @xmath67 to @xmath68 . increasing the size of the sample the ergodic time increases too , such that in the thermodynamic limit ergodicity is broken due to the divergence of the ergodic time , yielding broken symmetry . since monte carlo simulations",
    "are restricted to finite samples , the standard procedure to avoid the problems treated in the foregoing discussion is to consider the root mean square ( or the absolute ) magnetization as an appropriate order parameter @xcite . turning back to the mem",
    ", we find that the phenomenon of magnetization reversal ( as shown in figure 1(a ) ) causes the magnetization of the whole film to vanish at every non - zero temperature , provided that the film s length @xmath69 ( which plays the role of @xmath65 ) is much larger than @xmath39 ( which plays the role of @xmath66 ) . therefore ,",
    "as in the case of the ising model @xcite , in order to overcome shortcomings derived from the finite - size nature of monte carlo simulations we have measured the mean absolute column magnetization , given by    @xmath70    in the stripped geometry used in this work the bias introduced by the linear seed ( a starting column made up entirely of up spins ) can be studied in plots of @xmath71 versus @xmath72 .",
    "it is found that @xmath73 exhibits a transient growing period with a characteristic length of order @xmath2 , followed by the attainment of a stationary regime .",
    "in addition , using several randomly generated seeds we could also establish that the system evolves into a given stationary state independently of the seed employed .",
    "thus , the spin - up linear seed can be used throughout without loss of generality .",
    "this behavior has been observed throughout the range of interest studied in the present work , i.e. @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "so , the influence exerted on the spin system by the seed can be easily recognized and eliminated from our results just by disregarding the first @xmath76 columns , with @xmath60 ranging between 10 and 50 .",
    "the given procedure of column averaging out from the transient region represents a significant advantage of the stripped geometry used for the simulation of the mem , in addition to that already mentioned ( see section ii ) .",
    "in fact , when a single seed at the center of the sample is used , the definition of the average magnetization of the whole cluster is strongly biased by the cluster s kernel orientation at the early stages of the growing process .",
    "hence , it turns very difficult in this case to disentangle the stationary regime from the transient region .",
    "moreover , film growth on planar substrata has the advantage that it can be implemented experimentally , e.g. via vapor deposition in vacuum , chemical deposition , electrodeposition , etc .",
    "= 3.9 in = 2.7 in    the mean column magnetization given by equation ( 3 ) is a fluctuating quantity that can assume @xmath77 values .",
    "then , for given values of both @xmath2 and @xmath36 , the probability distribution of the mean column magnetization @xmath78 can straightforwardly be evaluated , since it represents the normalized histogram of @xmath79 taken over a sufficiently large number of columns in the stationary region @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit ( lattice size going to infinite )",
    "the probability distribution @xmath80 of the order parameter of an equilibrium system at criticality is universal ( up to rescaling of the order parameter ) and thus it contains very useful and interesting information on the universality class of the system @xcite . for example , @xmath81 contains information about all momenta of the order parameter @xmath79 , including universal ratios such as the binder cumulant @xcite .",
    "figure 4 shows the thermal dependence of @xmath81 for a fixed lattice size ( @xmath82 in the present example ) as obtained for the @xmath18dimensional mem . we can observe that at high temperatures @xmath81 is a gaussian centered at @xmath83 .",
    "as the temperature gets lowered , the distribution broadens and develops two peaks at @xmath84 and @xmath43 . further decreasing the temperature causes these peaks to become dominant while the distribution turns distinctly non - gaussian , exhibiting a minimum just at @xmath83 .",
    "it should be pointed out that the emergence of the maxima at @xmath85 is quite abrupt .",
    "this behavior reminds us the order parameter probability distribution characteristic of the one dimensional ising model .",
    "in fact , for the well studied @xmath86dimensional ising model @xcite , we know that for @xmath87 , @xmath88@xcite is a gaussian centered at @xmath89 , given by    @xmath90    where the susceptibility @xmath91 is related to order parameter fluctuations by    @xmath92    decreasing temperature the order parameter probability distribution broadens , it becomes non - gaussian , and near @xmath56 it splits into two peaks that get the more separated the lower the temperature .",
    "for @xmath93 and linear dimensions @xmath2 much larger than the correlation length @xmath94 of order parameter fluctuations , one may approximate @xmath88 near the peaks by a double - gaussian distribution , i.e.    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is the spontaneous magnetization , while the susceptibility @xmath91 is now given by    @xmath97    from equation ( 6 ) it turns out that the gaussian squared width @xmath98 associated with high temperature distributions is very close to the 2nd moment of the order parameter , i.e.    @xmath99    it should be noticed that this equation is a straightforward consequence of the gaussian shape of the order parameter probability distribution and , thus , it holds for the mem as well .",
    "> from the well known one - dimensional exact solution for a chain of @xmath2 spins @xcite one can establish the relationship    @xmath100    then , equations ( 7 ) and ( 11 ) lead us to    @xmath101    ( where it has been taken into account that @xmath102 due to finite - size effects , irrespective of temperature ) . from equations ( 10 ) and",
    "( 12 ) we can see that the high temperature gaussian probability distribution broadens exponentially as @xmath36 gets lowered , until it develops delta - like peaks at @xmath103 as a consequence of a boundary effect on the widely extended distribution .",
    "it should be noted that for @xmath104 this phenomenon is prevented by the finite critical temperature which splits the gaussian , as implied by equation ( 8) .",
    "= 3.9 in = 2.7 in    figure 5 shows the thermal evolution of the probability distribution as obtained for the @xmath105dimensional mem , using a lattice of side @xmath106 . for high temperatures",
    ", the probability distribution corresponds to a gaussian centered at @xmath107 . at lower temperatures we observe the onset of two maxima located at @xmath108 @xmath109 , which become sharper and approach @xmath110 as @xmath36 is gradually decreased .",
    "these low - temperature probability distributions clearly reflect the occurrence of the magnetization reversal effect already discussed for the case of @xmath18dimensional magnetic films .",
    "= 3.8 in = 2.5 in    figure 6 shows the location of the maximum of the probability distribution as a function of temperature for both @xmath111-dimensional mem models ( with @xmath112 ) where we consider only maxima located at @xmath113 , since the distributions are symmetric around @xmath114 .",
    "after inspection of figure 6 , it becomes apparent the different qualitative behaviors of both systems .",
    "in fact , while for the @xmath115 case we observe a smooth transition from the @xmath116 value characteristic of high temperatures to nonzero @xmath117 values that correspond to lower temperatures , the curve obtained for @xmath118 shows , in contrast , a heaviside - like jump .",
    "the latter case reflects a behavior which is similar to that observed simulating the equilibrium ising model in 1d .    in order to carry out a quantitative comparison between both models ,",
    "we have also evaluated the average absolute magnetization ( @xmath119 ) for chains of the same length @xmath2 that the columns of the @xmath18dimensional mem .",
    "figure 7 shows log - linear plots of @xmath120 versus @xmath54 obtained for two different values of @xmath36 .",
    "it becomes evident that the different @xmath121dependent values of the magnetization are finite size effects observed as a consequence of the strips used .",
    "such effects vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "= 3.8 in = 2.5 in    in contrast to the @xmath18dimensional case , the behavior exhibited by the @xmath122-dimensional mem ( e.g. , as displayed by figures 5 and 6 ) is the signature of a thermal continuous phase transition that takes place at a finite critical temperature .",
    "it should be noticed that this transition involves the entire system , that may be either in the disordered phase or in the ordered one , depending on temperature .",
    "the broken symmetry at a finite critical temperature @xmath56 implied by the thermal continuous phase transition can be explained in terms of the broken ergodicity that occurs in the system when we tend to the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath123 ) making use of the temperature dependence exhibited by the order parameter distribution function .",
    "in fact , if we introduce an ergodic length @xmath124 defined by @xmath125 , where @xmath44 is the characteristic length of mem s domains , we can carry out a complete analogy with the ising model by associating @xmath124 to @xmath66 ( the ising model ergodic time ) and the above mentioned film s total length @xmath69 to the ising model observation time @xmath65 . in this way",
    ", we encounter that excursions of @xmath126 from @xmath127 to @xmath128 and _ vice versa _ occur at length scales of the order of @xmath124 .",
    "when the film s total length becomes larger and larger ( @xmath129 ) the whole film s magnetization is averaged to zero .",
    "furthermore , @xmath124 diverges as the strip s width becomes larger and larger , as shown in figure 3 , and again broken symmetry arises as the consequence of broken ergodicity .",
    "= 3.8 in = 2.5 in    it should be noted that as in the case of equilibrium systems , in the present case various  effective \" l - dependent critical temperatures can also be defined . in particular",
    ", we will define @xmath130 as the value that corresponds to @xmath131 for fixed @xmath2 , and @xmath132 as the temperature that corresponds to the maximum of the susceptibility for a given @xmath2 , assuming that the susceptibility is related to order parameter fluctuations in the same manner as for equilibrium systems ( as given by equations ( 7 ) and ( 9 ) ) .",
    "then , we should be able to obtain @xmath56 from plots of @xmath133 versus @xmath54 ( for @xmath134 ) , as it is shown in figure 8 .",
    "indeed , following this procedure we find that , for @xmath123 , both @xmath130 and @xmath132 extrapolate ( approximately ) to the same value , allowing us to evaluate the critical temperature @xmath135 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "notice that @xmath56 depends on both the coordination number and the topological structure of the lattice .",
    "furthermore , these properties are not uniquely determined by the dimensionality .",
    "so , the small value of @xmath56 obtained for the mem , as compared to the ising model on the square lattice with four nearest neighbors ( nn ) given by @xmath136 @xcite , reflects the fact that the effective number of occupied nn sites upon deposition of spins in the mem ( @xmath137 ) should be @xmath138 .",
    "furthermore , the effective topological structure of the mem compatible with the measured value of @xmath56 remains as an open question .",
    "in the present work we have studied the growth of magnetic films with ferromagnetic interactions between nearest neighbor spins in a @xmath0dimensional rectangular geometry ( for @xmath112 ) , using monte carlo simulations . for both dimensions the phenomenon of spontaneous magnetization reversal is observed at low temperatures .",
    "indeed , mem films grown at low temperatures are constituted by a sequence of magnetic domains , each of them with a well defined magnetization , such that the magnetization of adjacent domains is antiparallel .",
    "further increasing the temperature causes the onset of disorder in the bulk of the domains .",
    "subsequently , a rounded effective transition to a fully disordered state takes place .",
    "these pseudo `` phase transitions '' occur at film width ( @xmath2 ) dependent effective critical temperatures . however , in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath123 ) , the @xmath18dimensional mem is not critical ( the transition takes place at @xmath139 ) , while a true second - order phase transition is expected to occur at a finite temperature ( @xmath140 ) in the @xmath105mem .",
    "the observed behavior is reminiscent to that of the equilibrium ising model , although it should be stressed that the mem is a far - from - equilibrium growing system .",
    "the finite size of the films causing magnetization reversal and the occurrence of effective order - disorder transitions may be undesired effects that shall be avoided in the preparation of high quality magnetic films . however , these shortcomings may disappear if the film strongly interacts with the substrate where the actual growing process takes place .",
    "further studies on the growth of magnetic films in the presence of surface magnetic films , that account for the interaction with the substrate , are under progress @xcite .",
