    "namely , we define @xmath309 for @xmath310 and @xmath307 , but define @xmath311 for @xmath312 and @xmath307 ; see figure [ fig : dupl ] .",
    "finally , we partition @xmath284 where @xmath313 , @xmath314 , @xmath315 .",
    "we then define @xmath316 for the remaining @xmath22 in the usual fashion .          by axiom ( iii ) for @xmath9",
    ", @xmath141 is partitioned into finitely many @xmath142-invariant components @xmath143 of positive measure , each of which is @xmath144-ergodic .",
    "this induces a partition of @xmath318 into the @xmath319 components @xmath320 , and each of these components are clearly @xmath144-ergodic .",
    "now we verify axiom ( iv ) .",
    "we need to show that @xmath321 up to null sets for each @xmath149 and @xmath322 .",
    "denote the right - hand side by @xmath208 , thus @xmath208 is @xmath0-invariant and contains @xmath323 . on the other hand , by axiom ( iv ) for @xmath9 and the pigeonhole principle",
    ", there exists @xmath22 such that @xmath324 intersects @xmath303 in a set of positive measure .",
    "we may assume that the word length @xmath7 of @xmath8 is minimal among all @xmath8 with this property , thus @xmath325 is null whenever @xmath326 .",
    "from this we see that @xmath327 intersects @xmath328 in a set of positive measure ( since the dynamics of @xmath329 are just a trivial lift of the dynamics of @xmath330 outside of @xmath331 ) . from construction of @xmath308",
    ", this implies that @xmath332 intersects @xmath333 in a set of positive measure , and hence by axiom ( ii ) the union of @xmath334 and @xmath335 intersects @xmath336 in a set of positive measure ; in particular , @xmath208 intersects @xmath336 in a set of positive measure .",
    "as @xmath208 is @xmath337-invariant , we conclude from axiom ( iii ) that @xmath208 contains @xmath338 up to null sets for some @xmath339 .",
    "next , by another appeal to axiom ( iv ) and the pigeonhole principle , we can find @xmath340 such that @xmath341 and @xmath145 intersect in a set of positive measure .",
    "note that as there are only @xmath77 choices for @xmath342 , the word length of @xmath343 can be bounded above , and the measure of @xmath344 bounded below , by quantities independent of @xmath137 .",
    "because of this , we see that if @xmath137 ( and hence @xmath303 ) is small enough , then @xmath345 and @xmath346 also intersect in a set of positive measure ; thus @xmath208 must intersect @xmath346 in a set of positive measure , and hence by the @xmath144-ergodicity of @xmath145 , @xmath208 contains @xmath346 up to null sets .",
    "since @xmath208 already contained @xmath323 , we thus have @xmath347 contained in @xmath208 up to null sets .",
    "now for any @xmath348 , we have from axiom ( iv ) that @xmath349 for some @xmath350 and @xmath22 .",
    "this implies that @xmath351 for some @xmath352 , and hence @xmath353 for almost every @xmath354 , which gives axiom ( iv ) for @xmath355 as required .",
    "we let @xmath356 be a large natural number , depending on all previous quantities ( in particular , depending on @xmath137 ) , to be chosen later .",
    "the functions @xmath357 will be defined for negative @xmath11 by the formulae @xmath358 and @xmath359 for any @xmath55 and @xmath201 .",
    "informally , @xmath290 is two copies of @xmath290 , one over @xmath360 and one over @xmath361 , with the latter experiencing a significant time delay and also a slight reduction in amplitude ; the point is that we can delay the @xmath361 dynamics until the dynamics of @xmath360 has mixed almost completely , so that half of the mass of the @xmath360 component is spread out almost uniformly over @xmath361 , allowing for the crucial amplitude reduction for the @xmath361 component .",
    "the idea behind this construction is due to ornstein ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 4 ) .",
    "clearly , axiom ( vii ) is a consequence of axiom ( vii ) ( we allow the constant @xmath362 to depend on @xmath356 ) . for functions supported on @xmath291 , the markov operator",
    "@xmath285 is a trivial lift of the markov operator @xmath98 , so ( from axiom ( vii ) ) one sees that @xmath288 for all @xmath275 .",
    "we now define @xmath290 for non - negative @xmath11 by setting @xmath363 so that axiom ( v ) holds .",
    "clearly the @xmath290 are non - negative and in @xmath364 , and direct calculation shows that axiom ( vi ) holds for all negative @xmath11 , and hence for all @xmath11 thanks to axiom ( v ) .      [ lima ] if @xmath137 is sufficiently small ( depending on @xmath300 , and the @xmath164 , but without any dependence on @xmath356 ) , we have @xmath365 for all @xmath55 outside of a set of measure at most @xmath177 .    by construction , we have @xmath366 for negative @xmath11 , all @xmath55 , and @xmath201 .",
    "now we turn to non - negative @xmath11 .",
    "note that as @xmath98 is a contraction on @xmath364 , the @xmath164 for non - negative @xmath11 are uniformly bounded in @xmath364 by some quantity @xmath367 independent of @xmath137 .",
    "a routine induction then shows that @xmath368 for all non - negative @xmath11 and some quantity @xmath369 that depends on @xmath370 but not on @xmath137 ; this is basically because on @xmath371 , the markov process associated to @xmath285 only differs from that associated to @xmath98 on the set @xmath372 , which has measure @xmath373 . applying @xmath374 and then the triangle inequality ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath375 for some @xmath376 independent of @xmath137 ; in particular , from markov s inequality we see ( for @xmath137 small enough ) that @xmath377 for all @xmath55 outside of a set of measure at most @xmath298 . combining this with",
    ", we obtain the claim .    if @xmath137 is sufficiently small ( depending on @xmath300 , and the @xmath164 , but without any dependence on @xmath356 ) , we have @xmath378 for all @xmath55 outside of a set of measure at most @xmath177 .",
    "we split @xmath379 where for negative @xmath11 , @xmath380 is the restriction of @xmath290 to @xmath381 , and for non - negative @xmath11 , @xmath380 is propagated by @xmath285 : @xmath382 observe that the @xmath383 component of @xmath290 does not depend on @xmath356 .    from lemma [ pet - good ] , we see that @xmath383 converges pointwise almost everywhere as @xmath57 to the constant @xmath384 in particular , @xmath385 converges pointwise almost everywhere to the same constant .",
    "thus , by egorov s theorem , and assuming @xmath356 sufficiently large ( depending on previous quantities such as @xmath386 , and the @xmath164 , but without any circular dependency of @xmath356 on itself ) we have @xmath387 for all @xmath55 outside of a set of measure at most @xmath298 .",
    "now we work on @xmath388 . for all @xmath389 ,",
    "an induction ( using axiom ( vii ) ) shows that @xmath388 is supported on @xmath390 , and that @xmath391 for all @xmath55 and @xmath201 . repeating the arguments used to prove proposition [ lima ] ,",
