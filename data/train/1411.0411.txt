    "magnetic order and coupling at coherent interfaces between oxides of perovskite type have received increasing interest during the last decade .",
    "this includes the search for phenomena already known from metal films , e. g. exchange bias effect between a ferro- and an antiferromagnetic layer@xcite and the interlayer coupling through non - magnetic spacer layers responsible for giant magnetoresistance in co / cu / co.@xcite additionally , new phenomena have been discovered reminding one of the two - dimensional electronic states at semiconductor interfaces , but adding the magnetic degree of freedom to electronic interface states.@xcite the most prominent example is the conducting electron gas at the interface between the insulators laalo@xmath2 and srtio@xmath2.@xcite the interface of ferromagnetic srruo@xmath2 ( sro ) with ferromagnetic manganites such as la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( lsmo ) is in a focus of interest , because it shows an antiferromagnetic coupling with thus far unparalleled coupling strength in oxides.@xcite the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling at the interface leads to antiparallel orientation of the magnetizations of thin adjacent sro and lsmo layers which can be sustained in a magnetic field of several tesla.@xcite the strong reduction of magnetic order at lsmo surfaces or interfaces termed as dead layer in previous work@xcite seems to be weak or absent at the lsmo / sro interface as has been shown , e.g. , in ref .",
    "subsequent work showed the complexity of magnetic order arising from combination of the antiferromagnetic interface coupling with magnetic anisotropies of the components which are perpendicular to the film plane and strong for sro and in - plane and weak for lsmo on srtio@xmath2(@xmath19 ) substrates , respectively .",
    "an inhomogeneous magnetization depth profile with in - plane ru spins near the interface and perpendicular ru spins inside the sro layer has been detected by neutron reflectivity measurements.@xcite the magnetic order at low temperatures depends heavily on the cooling history of samples.@xcite one reason for this is the alignment of ru spins during cooling through @xmath20@xmath21@xmath22 @xmath23150 k according to the more dominant energy of either ( i ) the exchange coupling to ordered mn spins ( @xmath20@xmath21@xmath24 @xmath25250 k ) at the interface , or ( ii ) the magnetic anisotropy energy of sro , or ( iii ) the zeeman energy in an applied magnetic field.@xcite at low temperatures , the magnetic anisotropy of sro is so large that full alignment of ru spins is hard to achieve in applied magnetic fields of a few tesla .",
    "hence , the arrangement of ru spins during cooling is ( partially ) frozen in .",
    "meaningful investigation of magnetic coupling at oxide interfaces has been enabled by the advance of experimental tools such as rheed - assisted layer - wise growth under high oxygen pressure@xcite and scanning transmission electron microscopy ( stem ) .",
    "the latter allows for semi - quantitative evaluation of chemical intermixing at interfaces by applying the high angle annular dark field technique ( haadf ) .",
    "thermal diffuse electron scattering at high angles ( > 70 mrad ) is recorded with the intensity of the localized , incoherent scattering processes proportional to @xmath26@xmath27 ( z denotes the atomic number ) .",
    "thus the position of atom columns or individual atoms is imaged with a brightness related to their atomic number , usually referred as @xmath26-contrast .",
    "this technique has been employed to characterize lsmo / sro interfaces.@xcite    biaxial epitaxial strain is crucial for magnetic exchange interactions because it systematically alters bond angles and lengths.@xcite it has been shown to strongly affect and even reverse the sign of mn - o - ru interface coupling in ultrathin srruo@xmath2/amno@xmath2/srruo@xmath2 ( a = ca or pr ) trilayers as observed by x - ray magnetic circular dichroism.@xcite that experiment revealed the impact of strain on the magnetic coupling by comparing trilayers grown coherently on srtio@xmath2(@xmath19 ) and laalo@xmath2(@xmath19 ) substrates",

    "we investigate the strain dependence of the antiferromagnetic coupling in lsmo / sro superlattices grown on piezoelectric pmn - pt substrates and find a large response to reversible biaxial strain .",

    "sls grown on sto are strained coherently to the substrate lattice with an in - plane parameter @xmath48@xmath51 = @xmath52 @xmath16 .",

    "the sl is not coherently strained to the pmn - pt substrate because of the larger in - plane parameter of @xmath48@xmath55 @xmath56 4.02 @xmath16 ( which depends on ferroelectric poling ) .",
    "strain relaxation occurred immediately at the substrate - sl interface where the first lsmo layer forms misfit dislocations .",

    "no strain relaxation has been found , pointing to a coherent growth of the sl .",
    "the in - plane lattice parameter of the sl on pmn - pt ( @xmath57 @xmath16 ) is slightly larger than that on sto ( @xmath52 @xmath16 ) .",
    "hence , lsmo layers are under slightly stronger tensile strain than in the sl grown on sto , while the sro layers are under very weak compressive strain . to characterize the strain state of the components , we use the in - plane lattice parameter and its deviation from the pseudocubic bulk value , ( whereas the out - of - plane lattice parameter of components can not be determined ) .",
    "in single layers of lsmo or sro on sto(@xmath19 ) substrates the film structure is expected to be tetragonal ( lsmo ) or orthorhombic with small monoclinic distortion ( sro ) , respectively , but the symmetry of the layers in the sl might be different . for example , it has been shown that ultrathin sro layers in sls with pcmo layers are tetragonal.@xcite    high - resolution stem images of the sl on pmn - pt confirm the absence of dislocations and other crystal defects breaking the coherence of the lattice inside the sl ( fig.[fig:2](a ) ) . probably due to the less well - defined surface of the pmn - pt substrate ( and the lattice mismatch of the components ) , the sro layers do nt grow in fully flat way , but show thickness fluctuations of @xmath58-@xmath35 unit cells .",
    "the intermixing at the interfaces has been probed by tracking the edx composition along lines across the interfaces using the ru - k@xmath59 and the mn - k@xmath59 x - ray intensities ( fig.[fig:2](b ) ) . from this figure ,",
    "intermixing of the elements ru and mn can be deduced to range over a distance of about @xmath60 unit cell for both interfaces lsmo / sro and sro / lsmo .",
    "interestingly , intermixing is very small at the interfaces in spite of the non - ideal flatness of the layers .",
    "this indicates the absence of a chemical driving force for intermixing under the applied growth conditions .",
    "no clear difference between the interfaces of lsmo / sro and sro / lsmo ( in the sequence of growth ) has been found , contrary to the expectation for a well - defined termination of sharp interfaces between layers of complete perovskite unit cells .",
    "this may result from a random termination on the pmn - pt surface or be a consequence of the intermixing .",
    "an inspection by stem of a sl on srtio@xmath2 substrate revealed fully coherent growth of flat layers comparable to earlier published work by ziese et al.@xcite a similar magnitude of intermixing at the interfaces has been found as for the sl on pmn - pt .",

    "temperature - dependent in - plane ( parallel to an [ @xmath34 ] direction ) magnetization curves recorded during warming in a moderate magnetic field such as @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9 = 0.1 t after field - cooling in @xmath58 t give evidence for the antiferromagnetic coupling of sro and lsmo layers .",
    "an example is shown in fig.[fig:3 ] inset where the total magnetization is the difference of the magnetizations of the components below the curie temperature of sro .",

    "= @xmath43 k ( and in the range of @xmath65 @xmath34 k ) , @xmath63(@xmath9 ) reveals hard - axis behavior and nearly reversible magnetization rotation for the normal direction ( fig.[fig:3 ] ) .",
    "this result indicates spontaneous in - plane magnetization for both layers .",

    "firstly , the lsmo layers align along the field , followed by the alignment of the sro layers at 1.8 t. this switching sequence is not immediately obvious , because strong antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling may lead to different switching sequences depending on the magnetic moments of both layers.@xcite zeeman energy in the applied field , magnetic anisotropy energy of the respective layers and interface coupling govern the switching and may lead to different loop shapes / switching sequences.@xcite based on layer thicknesses and ideal magnetization values of @xmath68 @xmath7@xmath69/mn for lsmo and @xmath70 @xmath7@xmath69/ru one expects the magnetic moment of lsmo layers to be larger than that of sro layers .",
    "this would mean , based on magnetization values , that the first switching step is related to lsmo alignment ( fig.[fig:3 ] ) , whereas the second is the sro alignment with the applied field . but this argumentation is weakened by the fact that ultrathin strained lsmo layers are not fully ordered and one does not know their magnetization well enough .",
    "more confirmation for the switching sequence is found in the strain response as discussed below .",
    "we assign the midpoint of the sro transition ( defined as the point where @xmath29% of the sro magnetization has been switched ) as the coupling field @xmath9@xmath10 .",
    "@xmath9@xmath10 increases from @xmath71 t to @xmath72 t when the sample is cooled from @xmath34 k to @xmath18 k. the magnitude and temperature dependence of @xmath9@xmath10 are qualitatively similar to earlier work on sls on srtio@xmath2(@xmath19 ) substrates,@xcite but seem to depend sensitively on the quality of the interfaces .",
    "@xmath9@xmath10 is proportional to the inverse sro thickness,@xcite and decreases with increased level of interface roughness / interdiffusion .",
    "there is no information on the impact of biaxial in - plane strain on the coupling strength available thus far .",
    "the observed strong afm coupling in the sl on pmn - pt indicates good structural interface quality in agreement with the chemically sharp interfaces found by stem .",
    "the fluctuations in sro layer thickness surely have the effect of broadening the switching transition .",
    "we note that other samples prepared under less favourable growth conditions did not show strong ( or even any ) coupling ; deposition parameters are vital to obtain strongly coupled samples on pmn - pt .",
    "field cooled ( fc ) at @xmath58 t in - plane ( ip ) and out - of - plane ( op ) magnetization loops at @xmath20 = 10k of the superlattices on ( a ) pmn - pt and ( b ) sto , respectively . ]    at @xmath18 k where the anisotropy of sro is very large , the out - of - plane magnetization is more hysteretic and reveals some remanent magnetization ( fig.[fig:4](a ) ) .",
    "this indicates that some sro spins are canted out - of - plane at @xmath18 k. a canted or vertical easy axis may be present in an inner section of the sro layers@xcite at low temperatures .",
    "therefore , strain - dependent measurements have been restricted to @xmath20 @xmath25 @xmath65 k where @xmath63 essentially lies in the film plane .",
    "in - plane magnetization loops of the superlattice on pmn - pt in as - grown state ( @xmath73 = 0 ) and after piezocompression ( @xmath73= - @xmath74% ) . ]    for inspecting the effect of biaxial strain , fig.[fig:5 ] gives a comparison of the @xmath63(@xmath9 , @xmath20 = @xmath43 k ) loops in the as - grown and a biaxially compressed ( @xmath12 @xmath23 -@xmath74% ) state .",
    "the change between the two loops is reversible and controlled by the piezoelectric substrate strain .",
    "similar loops have been measured between @xmath65 k and @xmath34 k. the immediately obvious impact of the compression is an enlargement of the saturated magnetization ( at @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9 = @xmath67 t ) which roughly agrees with the enlargement seen after the first switching step ( at @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9 = @xmath60 t ) ( fig.[fig:5 ] ) .",
    "we note that the strain - induced shift of the transition field is only visible in the expanded view in fig.[fig:6 ] discussed later .",
    "ferromagnetic order in lsmo is known to be very sensitive to tensile strain , reflected in strong strain - induced shifts of @xmath20@xmath21 for thicker lsmo films.@xcite ultrathin lsmo films like those in the present sl sample show some magnetic disorder at the interfaces which substantially reduces the lsmo magnetization .",
    "( we estimate an ordered moment of @xmath75 @xmath7@xmath69/mn below . )",
    "the latter fact makes the lsmo magnetization strain - dependent through the influence of strain on the ferromagnetic double exchange interaction .",

    "these values have been estimated from the strain - induced magnetization increase observed around @xmath60 t ( where sro is anti - aligned to lsmo , see fig.[fig:3 ] ) and @xmath67 t ( where sro is aligned parallel to lsmo ) . as expected for a strain effect on lsmo only",
    ", the magnetization increase is the same in both cases .",
    "this reveals a general crucial point in assessing the interlayer exchange coupling as an independent parameter of interest , because the intralayer magnetic order matters for the observable coupling strength .",
    "stronger apparent afm coupling of the sro layer at the interface as detected by strain - dependent magnetization measurements may result from both , ( i ) stronger mn - o - ru exchange interaction and ( ii ) higher ordered mn moment at the interface .",
    "( we note that the extreme case of randomly oriented mn moments would offer no net coupling to ferromagnetically aligned ru moments . )",
    "the issue is further discussed below .     direct view on the change of antiferromagnetic coupling field ( h@xmath10 ) induced by the piezo - compression at ( a ) @xmath20 = 80k and ( b ) @xmath20 = 60k .",
    "we define h@xmath10 as the field where 50% of the sro magnetization has been switched . ]",
    "strain - induced changes of @xmath9@xmath10 have been determined as the difference of @xmath9@xmath10 values in two investigated strain states .",
    "care has been taken to check the reversibility of the strain - induced change and the reproducibility of the values in several samples and at several temperatures .",
    "the two strain states have been measured in immediate sequence , and curves have not been smoothed .",
    "fig.[fig:6 ] provides a direct view on the change of @xmath9@xmath10 induced by the piezo - compression in the following way : the @xmath73 = 0 loop has been shifted vertically by a constant value to match the loop under strain at saturation ( @xmath67 t ) . in this way , the strain - enhanced lsmo magnetization is compensated .",
    "one notes the shift of @xmath9@xmath10 at the @xmath29% level of the transition .",
    "the values are @xmath7@xmath8@xmath11@xmath9@xmath10/@xmath12 = -@xmath79 mt % @xmath15 , -@xmath14 mt % @xmath15 , and -@xmath80 mt % @xmath15 ( with an error of @xmath23@xmath30% ) at the temperatures of @xmath65 k , @xmath43 k , and @xmath34 k. ( lower temperatures have not been investigated because the spontaneous magnetization shows some reorientation out of the film plane as discussed above . ) further , there is a lower slope d@xmath63/d@xmath9 of lsmo around @xmath60 t in the strained case .",
    "the latter results from better ferromagnetic order of the lsmo layers after partial release of tensile strain .",
    "the magnetic behavior of the reference sl sample grown on sto substrate is useful to compare because of its smaller in - plane lattice parameter .",
    "the curie temperatures of the components are @xmath20@xmath21@xmath22 = @xmath81 k and @xmath20@xmath21@xmath24 = @xmath82 k. @xmath20@xmath21@xmath22 is not so far from the sro bulk value , but smaller than that of the sl on pmn - pt , in qualitative agreement with the increase of @xmath20@xmath21@xmath22 between a = @xmath52 @xmath16 and @xmath57 @xmath16.@xcite @xmath20@xmath21@xmath24 is about @xmath83 k higher on sto , an expectable shift for the @xmath84% weaker tensile strain of the lsmo layers .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy of both sls is quite different ( fig.[fig:4 ] ) : curiously , the in - plane and out - of - plane @xmath63(@xmath9 ) loops for both cases appear nearly like interchanged at @xmath18 k. weak hysteresis and rotation of magnetization in the field occurs for the in - plane [ @xmath34@xmath85 direction on sto , whereas the out - of - plane @xmath63 shows a distinct transition at an antiferromagnetic coupling field of @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9@xmath10 = @xmath72 t. hence , both layers of lsmo and sro in the sl on sto have a spontaneous perpendicular ( or canted ) magnetization which is antiferromagnetically coupled .",
    "this coupling is of similar strength like the in - plane coupling for the sl on pmn - pt .",
    "this change of the magnetic anisotropy is consistent with the known influence of epitaxial strain on the anisotropy in single sro layers , where compressed films on sto(@xmath19 ) substrate show tilted perpendicular anisotropy.@xcite    regarding the origin of strain - dependent antiferromagnetic coupling , we consider previously reported models .",
    "first principles calculations by lee @xmath86 @xmath87.@xcite reveal the lowest total energy for the antiferromagnetic coupling of lsmo and sro layers for an in - plane lattice parameter close to the one we got on pmn - pt substrates .",
    "similarly , the antiferromagnetic state has been found in density functional theory calculations in ref .",
    ". the influence of in - plane strain has not been investigated yet in such calculations , to our knowledge . on the other hand , discussion of interface magnetic coupling in oxides has been based on orbital hybridization and strain - dependent orbital occupation in recent work.@xcite for our lattice parameter of @xmath57 @xmath16 ( strong tensile strain of lsmo ) , mn @xmath89@xmath90 orbital energies are split leading to strong in - plane @xmath91@xmath27-@xmath92@xmath27 orbital occupation in mn@xmath93 ions .",
    "this reduces coupling via the @xmath89@xmath90 orbitals .",
    "the piezo - compression releases a small part of tensile strain and enhances the probability of electrons to occupy out - of - plane orbitals ( @xmath67d @xmath94@xmath95 xz and yz minority orbitals for ru , @xmath35d @xmath89@xmath90 3@xmath96@xmath27-@xmath97@xmath27 for mn ) .",
    "hence , one would expect stronger hybridization and magnetic coupling under piezo - compression , in line with the observed sign of the strain effect on antiferromagnetic coupling .",
    "the details in an orbital picture seem to be less clear if one uses previously suggested arguments .",
    "seo et al.@xcite have discussed a strain - dependent orbital occupation of ru@xmath98 ions at interfaces of sro with various manganites , and find a stronger antiferromagnetic coupling for the larger in - plane parameter .",
    "this agrees with their experimental results ( for different manganites than lsmo ) , but conflicts with our observation . in a step beyond ,",
    "the contributions of @xmath89@xmath90 orbitals have been considered . in srruo@xmath2 , the ru@xmath98 @xmath89@xmath90 orbitals are empty because of the large crystal field splitting . in mn@xmath98 , they are empty , whereas in mn@xmath93 there is one @xmath89@xmath90@xmath99 electron .",
    "nominally , lsmo contains @xmath100% of mn@xmath98 and @xmath101% mn@xmath93 ions .",
    "coupling via the @xmath89@xmath90 @xmath35@xmath96@xmath27-@xmath97@xmath27 orbitals of mn and ru would thus be antiferromagnetic for mn@xmath98 and ferromagnetic for mn@xmath93 at the interface according to the goodenough - kanamori rules .",
    "the @xmath89@xmath90 @xmath35@xmath96@xmath27-@xmath97@xmath27 orbital occupation of mn@xmath93 is expected to increase with in - plane compression , because the single @xmath89@xmath90 electron gets a higher probability to leave the tensile - strain - stabilized @xmath91@xmath27-@xmath92@xmath27 orbital .",
    "again , this @xmath89@xmath90-orbital - related mechanism reduces the total antiferromagnetic coupling upon in - plane compression and thus disagrees with our result .",
    "possibly , these single - orbital considerations can not describe the unusually strong antiferromagnetic coupling at the lsmo / sro interface if it was based on itinerant electrons forming a joined band for both components .",
    "one more option should be considered , that is a non - ideal interface structure .",
    "interdiffusion of about one unit cell can strongly affect the experimentally observable coupling .",
    "recently , it was shown that mn ions of lower oxidation state can even reside on the a site of the abo@xmath2 perovskite lattice in case of a strong mn excess.@xcite if such a situation would occur at the lsmo / sro interface , additional magnetic coupling pathways would be present .",
    "such a mechanism present at non - ideal interfaces may also influence experimental results and calls for further improvement of knowledge on real interface structures .",
    "one outcome of this work is the finding that it is difficult to characterize the mn - o - ru interface coupling based on magnetization measurements if the mn - o - mn coupling at the interface is changing simultaneously .",
    "this is clearly true for our experiment , as is seen in the enhanced saturated magnetization of the lsmo layers upon piezo - compression .",
    "investigating interface coupling through magnetization measurements means to take into account the intralayer magnetic order in both components as well as the exchange coupling at the interface .",
    "manganite layers are known to show some degree of magnetic disorder at interfaces . in our experiment , this is evident from the lower saturated moment of lsmo as follows . for the as - grown state , the magnetic moment of @xmath23@xmath102 @xmath7@xmath69 per unit cell of the superlattice at @xmath60 t",
    "is assumed to represent lsmo layers aligned and sro layers anti - aligned with the field ( fig.[fig:5 ] ) .",
    "the reversal of sro layers yields a change by @xmath23@xmath103 @xmath7@xmath69 / u.c .",
    ", leading to an estimated ordered moment of @xmath75 @xmath7@xmath69 / mn , in contrast to @xmath68 @xmath7@xmath69 / mn for fully ordered mn spins .",
    "release of tensile strain is known to enhance the ferromagnetic mn - o - mn double exchange interaction in lsmo , in line with the observed larger lsmo magnetization upon in - plane compression .",
    "hence , we expect the increased antiferromagnetic coupling of sro layers to result partially from better ordered mn spins at the interfaces .",
