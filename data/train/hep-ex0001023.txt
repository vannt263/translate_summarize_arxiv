    "the physics of elementary particles and forces determined the development of the early universe and thus , of the structure of our world today ( * fig .  1 * ) .",
    "according to our present knowledge , three families of quarks and leptons , four fundamental interactions , their respective exchange bosons and a yet - to - discover mechanism to generate particle masses are the ingredients ( * fig .  2 * ) which are necessary to describe our universe , both at cosmic as well as at microscopic scales .",
    "three of the four forces are relevant for particle physics at small distances : the strong , the electromagnetic and the weak force .",
    "they are described by quantum field theories , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) for the strong , quantum - electrodynamics ( qed ) for the electromagnetic and the so - called standard model of the unified electro - weak interactions @xcite .",
    "the weakest force of the four , gravitation , is the major player only at large distances where the other three are , in general , not relevant any more : the strong and the weak force are short - ranged and thus limited to sub - nuclear distances , the electromagnetic force only acts between objects whose net electric charge is different from zero .    of the objects listed in * fig .",
    "2 * , only the @xmath2-neutrino ( @xmath3 ) , the graviton and the higgs - boson are not explicitly detected to - date . besides these particular points of ignorance , the overall picture of elementary particles and forces was completed and tested with remarkable precision and success during the past few years , and the data from the lep electron - positron collider belong to the major important ingredients in this field .",
    "this lecture reviews selected aspects of standard model physics at lep .",
    "the frame of this write - up is not a standard and text - book - like presentation , but rather a collection and reproduction of slides , pictures and tables , similar as presented in the lecture itself .",
    "since most of the slides are self - explanatory , the collection is only accompanied by a short , connecting text , plus a selection of references where the reader can find more detailed information .",
    "a decade of successful operation of the large electron positron collider , lep @xcite ( * fig .  3 * ) , provided a whealth of precision data ( * fig .  4 * ) on the electroweak and on the strong interactions , through a multitude of @xmath0 annihilation final states ( depicted in * fig .  5 * ) which are recorded by four multi - purpose detectors , aleph @xcite , delphi @xcite , l3 @xcite and opal @xcite .",
    "in the phase which is called lep - i `` , from 1989 to 1995 , the four lep experiments have collected a total of about 17 million events in which an electron and a positron annihilate into a @xmath4 which subsequently decays into a fermion - antifermion - pair ( see figs .  4 and  5 ) .",
    "since 1995 , the lep collider operates at energies above the @xmath4 resonance , @xmath5 ( lep - ii '' ) , up to currently more than 200 gev in the centre of mass system .",
    "the different final states of @xmath0 annihilations can be measured and identified with large efficiency and confidence , due to the hermetic and redundant detector technologies realised by all four experiments .",
    "an example of a hadronic 3-jet event , originating from the process @xmath6 with subsequent fragmentation of quarks and gluon(s ) into hadrons , as recorded by the opal detector ( * fig .",
    "6 * ) @xcite , is reproduced in * fig .",
    "the basic predictions of the standard model of electroweak interactions , for fermion - antifermion production of @xmath0 annihilations around the @xmath4 resonance , are summarised in * fig .",
    "8 * to * fig .  11 * , see @xcite and recent experimental reviews @xcite for more details .",
    "cross sections of these processes are energy ( s``- ) dependent and contain a term from @xmath4 exchange , another from photon exchange as well as a @xmath7 '' interference term ( * fig .  8 * ) .",
    "measurements of s - dependent cross sections around the @xmath4 resonance provide model independent results for the mass of the @xmath4 , @xmath8 , of the @xmath4 total and partial decay widths , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and of the fermion pole cross sections , @xmath11 .    beyond the lowest order born approximation `` , photonic and",
    "non - photonic radiative corrections must be considered ( * fig .  9 * ) ; the latter can be absorbed into running coupling constants '' ( * fig .",
    "10 * ) which , if inserted into the born approximation , make the experimental observables depend on the masses of the top quark and of the higgs boson , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "measurements of the fermion final state cross sections as well as of other observables like differential cross sections , forward - backward asymmetries and final state polarisations of leptons ( * fig .  11 * ) allow to extract the basic electroweak parameters .",
    "combined analyses of the data of all 4 lep experiments by the lep electroweak working group `` @xcite provide very precise results ( * fig .",
    "12 * ) : for instance , due to the precise energy calibration of lep @xcite , @xmath8 is determined to an accuracy of 23 parts - per - million , and the number of light neutrino generations ( and thus , of quark- and lepton - generations in general ) is determined to be compatible with 3 within about 1% accuracy . from radiative corrections and a combination of data from lep - i and lep - ii , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , the coupling strength of the strong interactions , @xmath1 , the effective weak mixing angle @xmath14 and the mass of the w - boson , @xmath15 , can be determined with remarkable accuracy ( except for @xmath13 which only enters logarithmically ) .",
    "a list of the most recent results @xcite is given in * fig .",
    "13 * , where also the deviations of the experimental fits from the theoretical expectations are given by the number of standard deviations ( pull '' )",

    "22 * , the anatomy of the process @xmath30  hadrons is illustrated .",
    "factorisation is assumed to hold when splitting this process into an electroweak part ( annihilation of @xmath0 into a virtual photon or @xmath4 and subsequent decay into a quark - antiquark pair ) , the development of a parton ( i.e. quark and gluon ) shower described by perturbative qcd , a hadronisation phase which can be modelled using various different fragmentation or hadronisation models , and finally a parametrisation of the decays of unstable hadrons ( according to measured decay modes and branching fractions ) @xcite .    a list of the most prominent qcd topics covered by the lep experiments is given in * fig .",
    "23*. for a more detailed introduction to qcd and hadronic physics at high energy particle colliders see e.g. @xcite ; earlier reviews of qcd tests at lep can be found in @xcite .",
    "one of the most prominent qcd - related measurements at lep is the determination of @xmath1 from the radiative corrections to the hadronic partial decay width of the @xmath4 , which is summarised in * fig .",
    "24*. the ratio @xmath31 is a totally inclusive quantity which is independent of hadronisation effects , and qcd corrections are available in complete @xmath32 , i.e. in next - to - next - to - leading order qcd perturbation theory @xcite . the determination of @xmath1 from @xmath33 , however , crucially depends on the validity of the predictions of the electroweak standard model .",
    "the basic principles of the physics of hadrons jets , which are interpreted as the footprints of energetic quarks and gluons , and the definition of hadron jets are described in * fig .",
    "25*. the most commonly used jet algorithms in @xmath0 annihilations are clustering procedures as first introduced by the jade collaboration @xcite , and variants of this algorithm @xcite as listed in * tab .",
    "1*.    for these algorithms , relative production rates of @xmath34-jet events ( @xmath34 = 2 , 3 , 4 , ... ) are predicted by qcd perturbation theory , and are therefore well suited to determine @xmath1 and to prove the energy dependence of @xmath1 , see * fig .",
    "26*. in particular , the relative rate of 3-jet events , @xmath35 , is predicted to be proportional to @xmath1 , in leading order perturbation theory .",
    "corrections in complete next - to - leading order , i.e. in @xmath36 , are available for these algorithms @xcite .",
    "hadronisation effects , however , may significantly influence the reconstruction of jets .",
    "this can be seen in * fig .",
    "27 * , where jet production rates are analysed using qcd model ( jetset ) events of @xmath0 annihilation at @xmath37  gev before and after hadronisation , i.e. at parton- and at hadron - level .",
    "the @xmath38 of 3-jet reconstruction , i.e. the number of events which are classified as 3-jet both on parton- and at hadron - level , normalised by the number of events classified as 3-jet on hadron level , is displayed in * fig .",
    "28*. the energy dependence of hadronisation corrections to measurements of 3-jet event production rates at fixed jet resolution @xmath39 is analysed in * fig .",
    "29*. from these studies , the original jade and the durham schemes emerge as the most reliable \" algorithms to test qcd in jet production from @xmath0 annihilations ( for a comparative study of the newer cambridge algorithm , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "especially the jade algorithm exhibits small and almost energy independent hadronisation corrections .",
    "this allows to test the energy dependence of @xmath1 and thus , of asymptotic freedom , without actually having to determine numerical values of @xmath1 , see * fig .",
    "30 * @xcite .",
    "hadronic event shapes ( * fig",

    "the results of one such study , performed by l3 @xcite using event shapes of lep - i and lep - ii data plus radiative events at reduced centre of mass energies , is shown in * fig .",

    "the corresponding values of @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the typical hard scattering energy scale of the process which was analysed , are displayed in * fig .",
    "35*. the data , spanning energy scales from below 1  gev up to several hundreds of gev , significantly demonstrate the energy dependence of @xmath1 , which is in good agreement with the qcd prediction .    evolving these values of @xmath42 to a common energy scale , @xmath43 , using the qcd @xmath25-function in @xmath44 with 3-loop matching at the heavy quark pole masses @xmath45  gev and @xmath46  gev @xcite , results in * fig .",

    "the overall error is calculated using a method @xcite which introduces an common correlation factor between the errors of the individual results such that the overall @xmath48 amounts to 1 per degree of freedom .",
