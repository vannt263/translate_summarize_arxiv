    "the problem of electromagnetic wave propagation in random inhomogeneous media has been the issue of the day for several decades .",
    "numerous publications are devoted to the analysis of different aspects of this problem ( see [ 1,2 ] and references therein ) . in this scientific area",
    "the subject of research is normally the scattering of electromagnetic ( acoustic ) waves in unbounded or partially confined systems ( for example , in waveguides ) which contain random inhomogeneities .",
    "researches on wave propagation in open statistically unregulated systems are stimulated by numerous applications for long - distance signal transmission in both radio and optical wave ranges .",
    "the problem of electromagnetic oscillations in confined systems with random inhomogeneities has significant meaning as well . at the same time , by now it has not been developed enough both from theoretical and experimental side .",
    "it is caused by , in particular , modern theoretical studies of electromagnetic wave propagation and scattering in random inhomogeneous media use assumption about the isotropy and homogeneity scattering medium filled confined systems [ 1,2 ] . therefore , they can not be applied in general to the study of confined systems such as cavity resonators .",
    "the experimental study also requires new approach to study electromagnetic oscillations in inhomogeneous cavity resonators in wide wavelength band .    in our recent paper [ 3 ]",
    "we suggested a new spectral approach to study confined systems with random inhomogeneous .",
    "there spectral properties of cavity spherical quasi - optical millimeter wave resonator filled with random sapphire particles were considered .",
    "the sapphire particles with dimensions of the order of operating wavelength affect significantly the resonator spectrum .",
    "the spherical frequency degeneration is completely removed and the spectral lines thus have chaotic distribution on the frequency scale . the lines became wider and the quality factor is correspondingly decreased .",
    "the analogous broadening of spectral lines caused by random inhomogeneities has been detected in refs .",
    "[ 4,5 ] , where resonators with random rough boundaries were studied .",
    "recently the question about the influence of random inhomogeneities on the resonator spectrum has attracted a great attention in relation to the design of lasers on open micro - resonators [ 6 ] . in such resonators ,",
    "the whispering - gallery modes with super - high quality factors can be excited .",
    "the possibility to realize such quality factors depends essentially on the number of inhomogeneities ( roughness level ) on the resonator boundaries .",
    "it should be realized that cavity resonator with extremely small dissipation loss is the almost hermitian system whose oscillations are formed due to the restricted motion of electromagnetic waves .",
    "therefore , the resonator spectrum is discrete .",
    "random inhomogeneities whether bulk or on the resonator boundaries not introducing additional dissipative loss in general have not to broaden the spectral lines .",
    "nevertheless , the broadening of lines in the spectrum effects and its stochastization have been detected in experiment [ 3 ] .    in this connection",
    "the question arises : what is the physical mechanism of spectral lines broadening and spectrum stochastization in the random inhomogeneous resonator ?",
    "the study of this question is one of the reasons of the present paper .",
    "another motivation is relevant to the nanoelectonics problem .",
    "recently the great emphasis is the study of a new type of nanoelectron systems ( so - called zero - dimensional ones ) .",
    "the charge carrier motion in these systems has space restriction in all three dimensions .",
    "the peculiar example of zero - dimensional system is a quantum dot ( qd ) .",
    "qd is a semiconductor area by the size of order of 10 nm with electron ( hole ) conductivity and restricted from outer area by potential barrier .",
    "owing to finite charge carrier motion the energy spectrum in qd is discrete and the number of spectral levels due to small qd size is relatively few .",
    "recently an elegant method of qd array implementation has been designed .",
    "this method is based on the self - organization effect in strained double gaas heterostructures [ 7 - 9 ] . the usage of qd array as an active medium permits to design lasers with high performance [ 10 - 12 ] . however , the self - organization process of qd array forming is difficult to manage .",
    "the random inhomogeneities that usually exist in heterostructure essentially affect on this process .",
    "they lead to inhomogeneous broadening of spectral lines [ 13 ] and , correspondingly , to degradation of laser radiation quality .",
    "the qd design method based on the self - organization effect is , in fact , an alternative to electron lithography whose level of development does not permit to implement the ordered array of approximately the same qds with small enough dispersion of their sizes . in the present paper",
    "we propose another way to design semiconductor laser system .",
    "this way presupposes the usage of the same regular microscopic areas ordered array that can be implemented by lithography as an active laser medium .",
    "this proposal is based on the following . at present technology of gaas mono - crystal with super high mobility and big length of phase coherence of charge carriers that achieves 10 @xmath0 and",
    "more is well - developed .",
    "due to that the system of microscopic regular areas with potential barrier on the margin of each of them made from such materials can be implemented .",
    "because of big length of phase coherence , carriers will take part in ballistic motion and reflect back from area margins .",
    "the motion of charge carriers is similar to dynamics of billiard systems . since this motion",
    "is described by shrodinger equation such a billiard system can be characterized as a quantum billiard ( qb ) .",
    "due to finite motion of charge carrier , electron spectrum of qb is discrete . at the same time it is quite dense ,",
    "because of a qb size is much bigger than the wavelength of quasi - particles .",
    "this fact makes complicate the qb usage as an active system for the semiconductor laser , because dense spectrum decreases frequency stability of laser radiation .",
    "the frequency jumps appear easily at the small deviation of control parameters in the laser resonator with dense frequency spectrum . as a result",
    "there is a problem of `` rarefaction '' of the spectrum : _ can the dense qb spectrum be done much sparser without changing of qb geometrical parameters ? _    a quasi - optical cavity resonator has dense and discrete frequency spectrum as well .",
    "the maxwell equation describing electromagnetic oscillations in such a resonator coincides with corresponding scalar shrodinger equation at definite conditions .",
    "all that gives an opportunity to use the quasi - optical resonators as model objects to study spectral properties of qb .",
    "similar modeling using microwave resonators was done earlier for study of the phenomena that is relevant to quantum chaos [ 14 - 17 ] .    in the present paper",
    "the nature of spectral lines broadening and their shifting are studied in a quasi - optical millimeter wave cavity resonator with random inhomogeneous inside . to clarify the mechanism of broadening and shifting the original statistical spectral theory based on the separation mode technique",
    "was worked out .",
    "this technique was designed earlier by one of the author for open waveguide systems [ 18,19 ] . using this technique we found out that the mechanism of spectral lines broadening was caused by intermode scattering . at that the largest broadening are subjected to closely set lines . and",
    "solitary lines keep high quality factor and intensity in the random inhomogeneous resonator .",
    "it results in so - called spectral `` rarefaction '' .",
    "the systematic experimental spectral measurements of numerous realizations of quasi - optical random inhomogeneity cavity resonator filling were carried out for theory results implementation .",
    "the experimental results proved that the main mechanism of broadening and shifting of spectral line is inter - mode scattering caused by inhomogeneities resonator filling .",
    "we detected theoretically predicted effect of `` rarefaction '' of the resonator spectrum .",
    "thus , we determined that the influence of inhomogeneities on the resonator spectrum has both , as known , negative nature ( broaden lines ) and a positive one .",
    "this positive influence is essential `` rarefaction '' of the spectrum .",
    "this fact can be important in qb usage as an active system in a semiconductor laser approach .",
    "here we state that the high quality modes are not subjected , practically , to broadening and can satisfy self - excitation laser condition even under big inhomogeneities in an active resonator medium .",
    "exactly the stable laser generation can be implemented under one of such modes .",
    "another aspect of influence of inhomogeneities on resonator spectrum relates to its stochastization . in the paper we carried out statistical analysis of the resonator spectrum with a different number of inhomogeneities .",
    "we found out that the inter - frequency ( if ) interval distribution in the resonator spectrum is close to poisson distribution in a small number of inhomogeneities .",
    "this kind of distribution has systems with non - correlated if intervals .",
    "the stochastic spectrum part appears at the increase of the number of inhomogeneities .",
    "the spectrum is mixed , i.e. contains regular and stochastic parts .",
    "we estimated relationship between regular and stochastic spectrum parts by statistical distribution analysis of if intervals depending on the quantity of inhomogeneities in the resonator .",
    "we carried out the modeling of semiconductor laser based on qb with random inhomogeneities .",
    "for the purpose of this we used a quasi - optical millimeter wave cavity resonator filled with random inhomogeneities and with an inserted gunn diode as an active element .",
    "in such a self - oscillation system we studied self - excitation oscillation conditions .",
    "we found out that the generation is unstable and multi - frequency exists in an empty resonator near the excitation threshold because of dense spectrum .",
    "such generation can be explained by frequency jumps in dense resonator spectrum .",
    "these jumps disappear because of `` rarefaction '' of the spectrum if inhomogeneities are inserted into the resonator , and total number of generating frequencies is decreased at a definite range of control parameters deviation .",
    "let us consider a cylindrical quasi - optical cavity resonator of radius @xmath1 and height @xmath2 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "inner volume of the resonator , @xmath3 , is assumed to be filled with the material having random inhomogeneous permittivity .",
    "we will be interested in oscillations that turn into transverse - electrical resonance mode ( @xmath4-mode ) provided that the resonator is filled homogeneously .",

    "we are interested in the analogy between electromagnetic resonators and solid - state micro - objects , namely , qds and qbs . in the case of classical resonance system , the problem of excitation by a given point monochromatic source is governed by the equation eq.([eq1 ] ) which should be supplied with @xmath15-term in the right - hand side .",
    "the equation thus obtained coincides in form with the equation for green function of quantum particles moving in dissipative medium and being subjected to inhomogeneous scalar potential . having this in mind we will carry out all further analysis relevant to the electromagnetic resonator in terms of the dynamic equation for particles in the quantum dot of cylindrical shape .",
    "the equation for green function of quantum particles moving in dissipative medium under the influence of random static potential @xmath16 has the form @xmath17g({\\bf{r}},{\\bf{r } } ' ) = \\delta ( { \\bf{r } } - { \\bf{r}}')\\ .\\ ] ] here @xmath18 is the dissipative attenuation time whose inverse value has the same physical meaning as the imaginary part of function @xmath19 in eq . taken with minus sign .",
    "the potential @xmath16 in the case of electromagnetic system is given by @xmath20 .",

    "the quality factor of such lines and , correspondingly , their intensity stay high at the resonator excitation .",
    "the intensity of adjacent lines broadened under the influence of inhomogeneities is essentially reduced .",
    "owing to that at the great number of inhomogeneities the resonator spectrum is `` rarefied '' - few solitary high quality factor spectral lines prevail in the spectrum",
    ". theoretical prediction of broadening and shifting of resonator spectral lines and spectrum `` rarefaction '' are subject to experimental check .",
    "for that purpose we studied experimentally in 8-millimeter wave range the spectrum of the quasi - optical cavity resonator filled with random small - scattered bulk inhomogeneities .",
    "these inhomogeneities were styrofoam particles with smaller size than operating wavelength .",
    "it is found out that such inhomogeneities lead to broadening and shifting the spectral lines . as experiment showed the maximum of their influence was on frequency adjacent spectral lines .",
    "the solitary lines , according to our theory , were subjected to this influence in much smaller degree .",
    "we detected the effect of stochastic spectrum `` rarefaction '' .",
    "they prove that the main mechanism of broadening and shifting of spectral lines is relevant to inhomogeneities intermode scattering .",
    "we studied also chaotic properties of oscillations in our resonator .",
    "it is found out that the empty resonator has if intervals distribution similar to poisson distribution that is typical to the spectrum with non - correlated if intervals .",
    "even at small number of inhomogeneities the resonator spectrum has random part that increases in proportion to the number of inhomogeneities in the resonator . at that if intervals distribution in random inhomogeneous resonator is described by brody and berry - robnik distributions of if intervals .",
    "we obtained the results concerning the influence of bulk inhomogeneities on the process of generation in a self - oscillatory system .",
    "the self - oscillatory system was a quasi - optical millimeter wave cavity resonator containing inhomogeneities with an active element as gunn diode .",
    "we detected that inhomogeneities leads to the essential `` rarefaction '' of the spectrum and creates conditions for monochromatic stable generation in self - oscillatory system .",
    "the inhomogeneous quasi - optical cavity millimeter wave resonator ( passive and active ) can serve as a model of semiconductor quantum billiard . based on our results we suggest using such billiards with spectrum rarefied by random inhomogeneities as an active system of semiconductor laser .    99 s.m .",
