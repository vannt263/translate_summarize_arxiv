    "isoperimetric inequalities are a fundamental tool in analysis and differential geometry .",
    "such inequalities , including sobolev and poincar inequalities and their numerous generalizations , have a large number of applications in various settings . in this paper",
    "we are interested in a discrete isoperimetric inequality studied by uk @xcite and later by erschler @xcite .",
    "it is of the form @xmath1 for a fixed , non - decreasing real function @xmath2 , a fixed point @xmath3 and a constant @xmath4 .",
    "the purpose of our work is to explore the connection between the inequality and one of the fundamental large - scale invariants , coarse homology .",
    "coarse homology and cohomology were first introduced by roe in @xcite for the purposes of index theory and allowed to formulate the coarse index on open manifold using assembly maps from coarse @xmath5-homology to the @xmath5-theory of appropriate @xmath6-algebras ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this approach proved to be very successful in attacking various problems in geometry and topology of manifold such as the novikov conjecture , positive scalar curvature problem or the zero - in - the - spectrum conjecture .",
    "block and weinberger @xcite introduced and studied a uniformly finite homology theory , where they considered only those chains in roe s coarse homology whose coefficients are bounded .",
    "this homology theory turned out to have many applications since vanishing of the @xmath7-dimensional uniformly finite homology group characterizes amenability . using this fact block and weinberger related it to the existence of aperiodic tilings and positive scalar curvature metrics on complete riemannian manifolds @xcite .",
    "later whyte used it to show the existence of bijective quasi - isometries ( i.e. bilipschitz equivalences ) between non - amenable groups @xcite .",
    "other applications can be found in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the homology theory we study here is a controlled homology theory for spaces with bounded geometry , where the upper bound on the chains growth type is specified and represented by a fixed , non - decreasing function @xmath2 .",
    "the case when @xmath2 is constant gives the uniformly finite homology of block and weinberger mentioned above , but our main interest is in the case when the chains are unbounded ( see section [ section : definitions ] for a precise definition ) .",
    "roe s coarse homology is also defined using unbounded chains , but without any control on the coefficients growth ( it is a coarsened version of the locally finite homology ) .",
    "our homology is a quasi - isometry invariant and contains information about the large - scale structure of a metric space .",
    "for the most part , we restrict our attention to the case of finitely generated groups and we are mainly interested in vanishing of the fundamental class @xmath8=\\sum_{x\\in   \\gamma}[x]$ ] in the @xmath7-th homology group @xmath9 .",
    "the main theme of our work is that the vanishing of this class describes `` how amenable '' a group is , through the isoperimetric inequality above . in the light of this philosophy and",
    "@xcite one can expect that on any group killing the fundamental class should require a 1-chain with at most linear growth .",
    "our first result confirms this with a direct construction of a linearly growing @xmath10-chain whose boundary is the fundamental class .",
    "this fact restricts the class of growth types that are potentially interesting to those with growth between constant and linear .",
    "as we explain at the end of section [ section : an explicit 1-chain ] , the theorem can be viewed as a weaker , homological version of the classical burnside problem for infinite groups with a positive solution . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the strongest result in this direction which is true for all infinite , finitely generated groups .    the result in section [ section : homology and inequalities ] states that the isoperimetric inequality holds on a given space if and only if the fundamental class vanishes in the corresponding coarse homology group and it is the second main result of the paper .",
    "this characterization generalizes the result of @xcite which arises as the case of bounded control and also gives a homological perspective on uk s result @xcite .",
    "moreover , using the results of erschler @xcite we obtain explicit examples of groups for which the fundamental class bounds 1-chains growing much slower than linearly .    in section [ section : examples ] we discuss explicit examples of amenable groups for which we can compute explicitly the control function @xmath2 , for which the fundamental class vanishes in @xmath9 .",
    "the estimates are obtained using invariants such as isodiametric and isoperimetric profiles .",
    "these invariants are well - known and widely studied ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and each of them can be used to estimate the growth of a 1-chain which bounds the fundamental class .",
    "our theory has some interesting applications to the problem of finding a primitive of a differential form on a universal cover of a compact manifold with prescribed growth .",
    "the question of finding such primitives was studied by sullivan @xcite , gromov @xcite and brooks @xcite in a setting which relates to that of @xcite , and later in @xcite .",
    "our results give exact estimates on this growth in the case when the group in question is amenable .",
    "namely , we can use all of the above invariants as large - scale obstructions to finding such primitives .",
    "for instance , if @xmath11 is an amenable group which has finite asymptotic dimension of linear type then the volume form on the universal cover of a compact manifold @xmath12 with the fundamental group @xmath11 can not have a primitive of growth slower than linear .",
    "our methods in particular give a different proof of a theorem of sikorav characterizing the growth of primitives of differential forms @xcite .",
    "another connection is to weighted poincar inequalities studied by li and wang @xcite .",
    "these inequalities are intended as a weakening of a lower bound on the positive spectrum of the laplacian and were used in @xcite to prove various rigidity results for open manifolds .",
    "it turns out that our isoperimetric inequalities and weighted poincar inequalities are closely related .",
    "we use this fact to show that the vanishing of the fundamental class is an obstructions to poincar inequalities with certain weights , which do not decay fast enough .    in a future paper",
    "we will use the theory presented here together with surgery theory to study positive scalar curvature on open manifolds , pontrjagin classes and distortion of diffeomorphisms .",
    "+ we are grateful to john roe , shmuel weinberger and guoliang yu for valuable discussions and suggestions .",
    "we will be considering metric spaces which are ( uniformly ) discrete in the sense that there exists a constant @xmath4 such that @xmath13 for any distinct points @xmath14 in the given space .",
    "additionally we assume that all our spaces have bounded geometry and are quasi - geodesic .",

    "both conditions are mild and are satisfied by common sub - linear growth types such as powers and logarithms .",
    "we shall define homology with coefficients in @xmath38 , but the definition of course makes sense for any normed ring , in particular @xmath39 .",
    "we represent the chains in two ways : as a formal sum @xmath40 , @xmath41 ; or as a function @xmath42 . in both cases",
    ", we think of @xmath43 as of simplices . in particular",
    ", we require the property @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a permutation of the simplex @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the number of transpositions needed to obtain @xmath48 from @xmath27 . for @xmath10-chains this simply reduces to @xmath49 .    given a chain @xmath50 the _ propagation _",
    "@xmath51 is the smallest number @xmath52 such that @xmath53 whenever @xmath54 for @xmath46 , where @xmath55 denotes the diagonal in @xmath56 .",
    "we now define the chain complex .",
    "denote @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a constant which depends on @xmath59 and the coefficients @xmath60 are real numbers .",
    "one can easily check using ( [ equation : f has the same growth under shifts ] ) that @xmath61 is a linear space which does not depend on the choice of the base point .",
    "we define a differential @xmath62 in a standard way on simplices as @xmath63)=\\sum_{i=0}^n ( -1)^i [ x_0,\\dots,\\hat{x_i},\\dots , x_n]\\ ] ] and by extending linearly .",
    "it is easy to check that ( [ equation : f has the same growth under shifts ] ) guarantees that the differential is well - defined .",
    "thus we have a chain complex @xmath64 and we denote its homology by @xmath65 . in particular , if @xmath66 , we obtain uniformly finite homology of block and weinberger @xcite ( with real coefficients ) , which we denote by @xmath67 and if @xmath2 is linear we will write @xmath68 .",
