    "the simplicity and numerical efficiency of the sph method were the main reasons why we chose similar technique for the modelling of the evolution of complex , multi  fragmented triaxial protogalactic systems .",
    "we used our own modification of the hybrid n  body / sph method @xcite , which we call as chemo  dynamical sph ( cd  sph ) .",
    "the `` dark matter '' and `` stars '' were included into the standard sph algorithm as the n  body collisionless system of particles , which can interact with the gas component only through the gravitation @xcite . the star formation process and supernova explosions were included into the scheme in the manner proposed by @xcite but with our own modifications .    for description of the process of the gas material convertion into stars",
    "we modify the standard sph star formation algorithm @xcite taking into account the presence of chaotic motions in the gaseous environment and the time lag between initial development of suitable conditions for star formation and star formation itself @xcite . after the formation , these `` star '' particles return the chemically enriched gas to surrounding `` gas '' particles due to snii , snia and pn events . for the description of this process we use the approximation proposed by @xcite .",
    "we consider only the production of @xmath0o and @xmath1fe , and try to describe the full galactic time evolution of these elements , from the beginning to present time (   @xmath2 gyr ) .",
    "the sph calculations were carried out for @xmath3 `` gas '' particles . according to @xcite ,",
    "such number seems to be quite enough to provide qualitatively correct description of the system behaviour .",
    "even such small number of `` gas '' particles produces a @xmath4 `` star '' particles at the end of calculation .    as initial model ( relevant for cdm  scenario ) we took constant ",
    "density homogeneous gaseous triaxial configuration ( @xmath5 ) within the dark matter halo ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "we set @xmath7 kpc , @xmath8 kpc and @xmath9 kpc for semiaxes of system .",
    "such triaxial configurations are reported in cosmological simulations of the dark matter haloes formation @xcite .",
    "we set the smoothing parameter of cdmh : @xmath10 kpc .",
    "to check the sf and chemical enrichment algorithm in our sph code , we use the chemical characteristics of the disk in `` solar '' cylinder ( @xmath11 kpc @xmath12 kpc ) .",
