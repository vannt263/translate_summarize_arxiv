    "<S> we develop a systematic method of performing corrected gate operations on an array of exchange - coupled singlet - triplet qubits in the presence of both fluctuating nuclear overhauser field gradients and charge noise . </S>",
    "<S> the single - qubit control sequences we present have a simple form , are relatively short , and form the building blocks of a corrected cnot gate when also implemented on the inter - qubit exchange link . </S>",
    "<S> this is a key step towards enabling large - scale quantum computation in a semiconductor - based architecture by facilitating error reduction below the quantum error correction threshold for both single - qubit and multi - qubit gate operations .    </S>",
    "<S> the prospective scalability of spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots , along with their demonstrated long coherence times and rapid gate operations , make them a leading candidate for quantum computing architectures . </S>",
    "<S> singlet - triplet qubits @xcite , where the quantum information is encoded in the zero - projection spin states of two electrons in a double quantum dot , are particularly promising due to their insensitivity to stray magnetic fields and their purely electrical controllability . </S>",
    "<S> however , precise experimental manipulation of singlet - triplet qubits is hindered by two sources of noise invariably present in all laboratory systems : fluctuations in the background nuclear spin bath due to long - range hyperfine - mediated flip - flop processes ( overhauser noise ) @xcite , and fluctuations in the electrostatic quantum dot confinement potential due to background electrons hopping on and off nearby impurity sites ( charge noise ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these fluctuations are slow ( @xmath0s ) compared to typical qubit rotation times ( @xmath1 ns ) , and this highly non - markovian characteristic can be exploited to suppress their effects by spin echo or related dynamical decoupling protocols when one does not aim to rotate but instead preserve the qubit state , i.e. quantum memory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ability to achieve very long quantum memory times in this way is one of the great advantages of semiconductor spin qubit architectures . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is that the dynamical decoupling scheme to preserve coherence does not work during the qubit gate operations .    </S>",
    "<S> similar protocols for robust qubit rotations are , therefore , highly desirable so that quantum coherence is preserved during the gate operations . </S>",
    "<S> however , singlet - triplet qubit control is subject to severe physical constraints that make this task quite daunting . </S>",
    "<S> a large inter - dot overhauser field gradient introduced by nuclear spin pumping @xcite ( or an actual magnetic field gradient due to a proximal micromagnet @xcite ) performs rotations about the @xmath2 axis of the bloch sphere , but this gradient is not tunable on the time scale of an operation </S>",
    "<S> . meanwhile , electrical control of the inter - dot exchange coupling by tilting the double - well potential @xcite leads to rotation about the @xmath3 axis of the bloch sphere , but the sign of the coupling is fixed . </S>",
    "<S> the only rapidly tunable element is the magnitude of the exchange coupling , and its range is limited by either the singlet - triplet splitting of two electrons on a single dot , or , more restrictively , by keeping the double - well near a symmetric configuration to avoid converting the spin qubit into a fragile charge qubit . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one is restricted to positive rotations about a limited range of axes somewhere between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and pulses approximating a delta function are not available . </S>",
    "<S> this unique set of constraints prohibits straightforward application of control techniques from the nmr literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the high - fidelity gate operations crucial to scalable quantum computation requires a totally new approach to the quantum control problem .    </S>",
    "<S> previously , we have shown that there exists a new form of control sequence that respects these constraints and eliminates the leading - order single - qubit error due to overhauser noise @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent numerical work has shown that both relevant types of error can be simultaneously addressed @xcite . despite this progress , there remains a need for a protocol that corrects both overhauser and charge noise errors while being sufficiently simple and flexible for incorporation into multi - qubit operations .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we present a method of pulse design that achieves this goal , systematically eliminating both errors to leading order for any quantum circuit . in the language of the nmr community </S>",
    "<S> , the task is similar to correcting arbitrary quantum gate operations for both amplitude and detuning errors simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> this task has only recently begun to be addressed in nmr @xcite , and it is remarkable that the far more restricted case of singlet - triplet qubits permits a simple solution , as revealed by our method . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our new pulse sequences are an order of magnitude faster than earlier , less - powerful sequences @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we begin by showing how to perform universal , robust , single - qubit gates . </S>",
    "<S> we then demonstrate how to use these single - qubit pulse sequences to generate a cnot gate that possesses the same resilience against errors . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show how to combine the prior two results to generate universal , multi - qubit , dynamically corrected operations on a large - scale quantum register . thus , our work forms a complete prescription for compensating low - frequency noise in ongoing singlet - triplet quantum computation experiments .    </S>",
