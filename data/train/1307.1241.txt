    "to explore the phase transition from the hadronic matter ( hm ) to quark - gluon matter ( qgm ) is one of the fundamental aims of relativistic nuclear collisions .",
    "a couple years ago , four international collaborations of brahms , phobos , star , and phenix at rhic have published white papers @xcite to declare their evidences for the discovery of strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) .",
    "one of the most important signals is the large elliptic flow parameter of produced particle in the au+au collisions at @xmath5=200 gev .",
    "the measurement of particle elliptic flow parameter @xmath0 is not trivial .",
    "several methods have been proposed , such as the event plane method @xcite , lee - yang zero point method @xcite , and the cumulant method @xcite etc .",
    "the cumulant method is even distinguished with two- , four- , and six - particle cumulants .",
    "the discrepancy among the @xmath0 values measured with the event plane method , lee - yang zero point method , and the cumulant method may reach a few ten percent as shown in fig . 4 and 5 of @xcite and in fig .",
    "11 of @xcite .",
    "recently , one even argued that the event plane method is obsolete @xcite .    on the other hand , the particle elliptic flow parameter @xmath0 is also not easy to investigate theoretically .",
    "the conventional ( hadronic ) transport ( cascade ) models always underestimated the @xmath0 experimental data in the nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic and/or lhc energies .",
    "in @xcite it was mentioned that the charged particle @xmath0 experimental data is around 0.05 in the au+au collisions at highest rhic energy ( estimated from @xmath3 in @xcite ) , while the urqmd model provides only half of this value .",
    "they have pointed out that a lack of pressure in the model at this energy may be the reason and that the partonic rescattering has to be taken into account in order to describe the data .",
    "similarly , the default ampt model ( ampt@xmath7 ) also underestimated the @xmath0 experimental data in the nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic energies @xcite . in order to meet with experimental data they updated ampt@xmath7 to the ampt@xmath8 with string melting . in the ampt@xmath8 model the hadrons ( strings ) from hijing @xcite",
    "are all melted to the partons .",
    "relying on the rescattering among huge number of partons ampt@xmath8 is able to account for the @xmath0 experimental data , provided the parton - parton cross section is enlarged to ten mb .",
    "of course , the ampt@xmath8 model has to hadronize the partons after rescattering by the coalescence model rather than the string fragmentation in ampt@xmath7 .    in the non - center nucleus - nucleus collisions the geometric overlap zone leads to the initial particle spatial asymmetry distribution .",
    "it is then dynamically developed to the final hadronic state transverse momentum asymmetry due to the partonic rescattering @xcite and the strong electromagnetic field @xcite etc .. we have pointed out that the transverse momentum @xmath9 and @xmath10 of produced particle from string fragmentation are randomly arranged on a circle with radius of @xmath11 in the paciae 2.0 model @xcite ( in the pythia model @xcite originally ) . here",
    "the observable with superscript @xmath12 refers to the string fragmentation local frame distinguished from the without superscript one referred to the nucleus - nucleus cms frame .",
    "this symmetric arrangement strongly cancels the final hadronic state transverse momentum asymmetry developed from the initial spatial asymmetry . in the new issue of a paciae model ( paciae 2.1 @xcite ) we randomly distribute the @xmath9 and @xmath10 of produced particle from the string fragmentation on the circumference of an ellipse instead of circle .",
    "paciae 2.1 is then able to describe the @xmath0 experimental data .    in the next section , section",
    "ii , a parton and hadron cascade model paciae , its new issue of paciae 2.1 , and the definition of elliptic flow parameter are briefly introduced .",
    "the calculated charged particle @xmath3 and @xmath4 are compared with the corresponding experimental data of the au+au / pb+pb collisions at @xmath5= 0.2/2.76 tev in the section iii . additionally , the predictions for charged particle @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the p+p collisions at @xmath13=7 tev and in the p+au / p+pb collisions at @xmath5= 0.2/5.02 tev are also given in the section iii .",
    "the last section is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "the paciae model is based on pythia @xcite . however , the pythia model is for high energy hadron - hadron ( @xmath14 ) collisions but the paciae model is mainly for nucleus - nucleus collisions . in the pythia model",
    "a @xmath14 collision is decomposed into parton - parton collisions .",
    "the hard parton - parton collision is described by the lowest leading order perturbative qcd ( lo - pqcd ) parton - parton interactions with the modification of parton distribution function in a hadron .",
    "the soft parton - parton collision , a non - perturbative process , is considered empirically .",
    "the initial- and final - state qcd radiations and the multiparton interactions are also taken into account .",
    "so the consequence of a @xmath14 collision is a partonic multijet state composed of the diquarks ( anti - diquarks ) , quarks ( antiquarks ) , and the gluons , besides a few hadronic remnants .",
    "it is followed by the string construction and fragmentation , thus a final hadronic state is obtained for a @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) collision eventually .    in the paciae model @xcite ,",
    "the nucleons in a nucleus - nucleus collision are first randomly distributed in the spatial phase space according to the woods - saxon distribution .",
    "the participant nucleons , resulted from glauber model calculation , are required to be inside the overlap zone , formed when two colliding nuclei path through each other at a given impact parameter .",
    "the spectator nucleons are required to be outside the overlap zone but inside the nucleus - nucleus collision system .",
    "then we decompose a nucleus - nucleus collision into nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath16 ) collisions according to nucleon straight - line trajectories and the @xmath16 total cross section . each @xmath16 collision",
    "is then dealt by pythia with the string fragmentation switched - off and the diquarks ( anti - diquarks ) broken into quark pairs ( anti - quark pairs ) . a partonic initial state ( composed of the quarks , antiquarks , and the gluons )",
    "is obtained for a nucleus - nucleus collision after all of the @xmath16 collision pairs were exhausted .",
    "this partonic initial stage is followed by a parton evolution stage , where parton rescattering is performed by the monte carlo method with @xmath17 lo - pqcd cross sections @xcite .",
    "the hadronization stage follows the parton evolution stage .",
    "the lund string fragmentation model and a phenomenological coalescence model are provided for the hadronization .",
    "however , the string fragmentation model is selected in this calculations .",
    "then the rescattering among produced hadrons is dealt with the usual two body collision model @xcite . in this hadronic evolution stage ,",
    "only the rescatterings among @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and their antiparticles are considered for simplicity .",

    "3 .   in the ampt@xmath8 model",
    "the partons after rescattering are hadronized by the coalescent model but by string fragmentation in the present paciae calculations .",
    "because of the first difference , the number of initial partons in paciae 2.0 is much less than the one in ampt@xmath8 .",
    "hence the strength of partonic rescattering effect in the former is not as strong as that in the later . therefore relying on partonic rescattering",
    "only the paciae model is hard to describe @xmath0 experimental data , unlike ampt@xmath8 .",
    "the rearrangement for the transverse momentum @xmath1 and @xmath2 components of the particles from string fragmentation , mentioned above , is then required .",
    "the spatial overlap zone formed in non - center nucleus - nucleus collision is almond - like , which is always assumed to be an ellipse with a half minor axis of @xmath41 along the @xmath1 axis ( axis of impact parameter ) and a half major axis of @xmath42 along the @xmath2 axis ( here @xmath43 refers to the radius of nucleus provided a symmetry nucleus - nucleus collisions is considered ) .",
    "originally this initial spatial asymmetry may develop dynamically into a final hadronic state momentum asymmetry due to the parton rescattering and the strong electromagnetic field etc .. unfortunately , in the pythia ( paciae 2.0 ) model once the transverse momentum @xmath11 of the produced particle from string fragmentation is randomly sampled according to the exponential and/or gaussian distribution , its @xmath9 and @xmath10 components are randomly arranged on a circle with radius of @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath44 where @xmath45 refers to the azimuthal angle of particle transverse momentum .",
    "this symmetry arrangement strongly cancels the final hadronic state transverse momentum asymmetry developed dynamically from the initial spatial asymmetry . as a prescription to minimize this cancelation , in paciae 2.1 @xcite we randomly distributed @xmath9 and @xmath10 on the circumference of an ellipse with half major and minor axes of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , instead of circle . i. e. @xmath48     ( panel ( a ) ) and @xmath4 ( ( b ) ) in the p+au collisions at @xmath5=0.2 tev ( @xmath49=0.1).,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    we know from ideal hydrodynamic calculation @xcite that the integrated elliptic flow parameter of final hadronic state is approximately proportional to the initial spatial eccentricity of nuclear overlap zone .",
    "therefore we assume that the introduced deformation parameter of @xmath49 here can be related to the deformation parameter of @xmath50 in the initial spatial phase space , i. e. @xmath51 where @xmath52 is an extra model parameter instead of @xmath49 .",
    "we also know that the spatial eccentricity of nucleon distribution in the initial overlap zone , reaction plane eccentricity for instance @xcite , can be expressed as @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the average over the nucleon spatial distribution .",
