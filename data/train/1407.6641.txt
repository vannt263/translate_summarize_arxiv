    "discrete gravitational systems generically feature a discretization or graph changing canonical dynamics @xcite .",
    "such a discretization changing time evolution can be interpreted as canonical coarse graining or refining operations @xcite .",
    "however , a temporally varying discretization is not restricted to discrete gravity models , but also arises when putting a field onto an evolving spatial lattice @xcite .",
    "the difference is that , in the gravitational case , the lattice structure itself satisfies a dynamics , while in the latter case only the field satisfies a dynamics and the evolving lattice is given as a fixed background .",
    "the evolution of a field on an evolving lattice can have the interpretation of either a dynamical coarse graining or refining if the change in the number of lattice sites results from a change in the density of lattice points in the background geometry , or of a cosmological field on a genuinely expanding or shrinking discrete universe if the change in the number of lattice sites results from the evolving background geometry .",
    "what is common to all these cases is the temporally varying number of degrees of freedom and the ensuing question of how to formulate and understand such a coarse graining or refining dynamics in a canonical language . in particular , the notion of evolving phase and hilbert spaces is required @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the question arises how and in which sense such a discretization changing dynamics can be symplectic in the classical case or unitary in the quantum theory .",
    "related to this , questions concerning the fate of observables as propagating degrees of freedom and of constraints and symmetries on temporally varying discretizations become pertinent .    in order to systematically understand such discretization changing dynamics or dynamics on evolving lattices ,",
    "a general formalism for variational discrete systems has been developed in @xcite for the classical case and in @xcite for the quantum theory .",
    "this formalism encompasses systems on both temporally varying or constant discretizations and includes a comprehensive constraint analysis and classification of the appearing degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular , this formalism provides thorough answers to the questions alluded to above .",
    "however , the analysis in the last four references has been very general and at times formal .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to restrict to a simple class of systems which permits us to apply the formalism and to carry out an exploration of its dynamical content explicitly .    in this manuscript",
    ", we shall therefore study the special class of discrete actions that are quadratic in the configuration variables .",
    "the reason we shall consider such quadratic discrete actions is twofold : firstly , they allow us to solve all equations of motion explicitly and thereby to classify all possible constraints and degrees of freedom , and , secondly , such actions are nevertheless interesting for many systems , e.g.  ( free ) field theory on a lattice or linearized theories .",
    "a linearized theory describes perturbations around highly symmetric solutions of some more complicated discrete theory .",
    "for instance , the considerations of the present work are relevant for linearized 4d regge calculus @xcite",
    ".    more concretely , we shall restrict to discretization changes generated by so - called _ global _ time evolution moves and classify all constraints and degrees of freedom arising from the corresponding quadratic discrete actions into eight types .",
    "the subsequent discourse will cover both the classical and the quantum case . as generally explained in @xcite",
    ", we shall see that the notion of observables as propagating degrees of freedom , of symmetries , of the reduced phase space and physical hilbert spaces depends , in general , on pairs of time steps and thus , in a spacetime context , on spacetime regions .",
    "this is not a fundamental problem of the formalism but merely reflects the fact that coarse graining and refining , or growing and shrinking the lattice , change the dynamical content of the system ; changes in the discretization lead to changes in the amount of dynamical information which the discretization can support . in particular",
    ", we shall see that coarse graining leads to a ` propagation ' of constraints and thereby to an increase in the number of constraints at a given time step and to non - unitary projections of physical hilbert spaces in the quantum theory . in this work",
    "we shall not specifically discuss the subtleties that arise when applying this formalism to discrete gravity models as this has been done in @xcite .",
    "the outline of the rest of this article is as follows : in section [ sec_prelim ] we recall basic concepts of time evolution in variational discrete systems . in section [ sec_quadact ]",
    "we introduce the class of quadratic discrete actions and the general symplectic structure , constraints and dynamics which they generate .",
    "subsequently , in section [ sec_nullvecs ] , we classify left and right vectors of the lagrangian two - form into eight types . according to these eight types ,",
    "we classify in section [ sec_constraintclass ] constraints and equations of motion and in section [ sec_classdof ] the occurring degrees of freedom . in section [ sec_unique ]",
    "we consider ` effective ' actions ( or hamilton - jacobi functions ) arising on solutions when composing different time evolution moves , while in sections [ sec_varcon ] and [ sec_classeff ] we analyze which consequences ` effective ' actions have for the constraint structure and the classification of constraints and degrees of freedom at a fixed discrete time step .",
    "then we shall switch to the quantum theory in section [ sec_qt ] , in order to study physical hilbert spaces , propagators , quantum time evolution maps , quantum constraints and degrees of freedom in an analogous manner .",
    "lastly , in section [ sec_summary ] we close with a brief conclusion . along the way , and for direct illustration , we shall apply the formalism to the example of a euclidean ( massive ) scalar field on an expanding two  dimensional square lattice .",
    "in the class of systems which we shall henceforth consider , namely variational discrete systems @xcite , the dynamics does _ not _ proceed by a continuous time evolution of the variables , but by a discrete time evolution of the latter on a discrete set of time steps .",
    "we shall label these time steps by @xmath0 .",
    "time evolution of the dynamical variables can thus not be generated by a hamiltonian through some bracket structure as in the continuum because this would necessarily yield an infinitesimal and therefore continuous dynamics .",
    "rather , the time evolution of the dynamical variables from a time step @xmath1 to the next step @xmath2 is generated by a _ time evolution move _ @xmath3 and an action @xmath4 which is associated to this move .",
    "the continuous configuration variables @xmath5 are the dynamical variables in the lagrangian picture and coordinatize the configuration manifolds @xmath6 of time steps @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "an additional index @xmath8 on @xmath9 will sometimes be suppressed for notational purposes .",
    "since the configuration manifolds are continuous one can vary and differentiate the action ( hence , the name variational discrete systems ) .",
    "examples of such variational discrete systems occur in discrete mechanics @xcite , lattice field theory @xcite and discrete gravity @xcite .    in a spacetime",
    "setting , an evolution move corresponds to a region of ( discrete ) spacetime , while a time step corresponds to a ( piece of ) boundary hypersurface of that region . to each such region one",
    "associates an action with boundary ( and possibly also bulk ) variables .",
    "the composition of evolution moves corresponds to gluing two spacetime regions along a common boundary and an addition of the associated action contributions .",
    "a schematic illustration of a composition of moves is provided in figure [ fig1 ] . in the sequel ,",
    "we shall solely focus on _ global evolution moves _",
    "@xmath3 @xcite which , in a spacetime context , correspond to evolving an entire boundary hypersurface at once such that the initial hypersurface @xmath1 does _ not _ overlap with the final hypersurface @xmath2 ( except possibly in a common boundary ) .",
    "accordingly , neighbouring time steps @xmath7 do not share any subsets of coinciding variables .",
    "this saves us from worrying about some subtleties which are besides the main point of this article and do not affect the classification .",
    "indeed , we emphasize that _ local evolution moves _ , such as pachner moves or tent moves in triangulations , which involve overlapping time steps and variables that appear at various time steps , can be treated within the same formalism ; this has been exhibited in detail in @xcite .",
    "in particular , given that global evolution moves as discussed in this manuscript can be decomposed into local moves , the subsequent classification of constraints and degrees of freedom is general and applies to those arising in local moves as well .     and",
    "@xmath10 correspond to two ( neighbouring ) spacetime regions with action contributions @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "gluing the two regions ( along a common boundary hypersurface ) to a new region and solving the equations of motion of the new bulk variables amounts to composing the two moves to a new move @xmath12 . to every such region or move there",
    "is associated a set of pre and post  momenta and pre and post  constraints . solving the equations of motion at @xmath13",
    "is equivalent to matching post and pre ",
    "momenta @xmath14 . ]    in the remainder of this work , we shall restrict to variational discrete actions which are quadratic in the configuration variables . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "such quadratic discrete actions occur in free field theory on a lattice @xcite ( see also the accompanying free massive scalar field example in the main body below ) and in perturbative expansions to linear order ( around some special solution ) of more complicated interacting theories as , for instance , in linearized regge calculus @xcite .    instead of reviewing the full lagrangian and canonical formalism for general variational discrete systems  which was developed in @xcite for the classical case and in @xcite for the quantum case ",
    "we shall explain and illustrate the relevant concepts along the way by means of this simple class of quadratic discrete actions . for details on the general formalism",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "these systematically generalize the earlier works @xcite to a full constraint analysis for variational discrete systems which , in particular , encompasses systems with a temporally varying discretization and thus a temporally varying number of degrees of freedom .",
    "( a related multisymplectic formulation has recently also been developed in @xcite . )",
    "the restriction to quadratic discrete actions permits us to explicitly solve the dynamics and thereby to provide an explicit classification of all the possible types of constraints and degrees of freedom occurring in such variational discrete systems .",
    "this serves as a complement to the general classification in @xcite .",
    "the most general form of a quadratic discrete action is [ sk ] s_n(\\{x_n-1},\\{x_n})=a^n_ijx_n-1^ix_n-1^j+b^n_ijx^i_nx^j_n+c^n_ijx_n-1^ix^j_n , where the ( constant ) coefficient matrices @xmath15 can vary with evolution step @xmath0 .",
    "note that @xmath16 and @xmath17 because @xmath18 must be symmetric .",
    "however , generally @xmath19 since @xmath20 is ( minus ) the coordinate form of the lagrangian two  form @xcite . despite expressly allowing for varying numbers of _ dynamical _ variables from step to step , as necessary for a temporally varying discretization @xcite , all indices run over the same number of variables @xmath21 because we directly work on extended configuration spaces @xmath22 .",
    "that is , if necessary , we artificially introduce spurious non - dynamical degrees of freedom ( on which the action does not depend ) at each step @xmath1 until @xmath23 @xmath24 ( see @xcite for details ) . as a result ,",
    "@xmath15 are square matrices @xmath24 ; if there are more dynamical variables @xmath9 at step @xmath1 than at step @xmath25 , we artificially extend the matrices @xmath26 and @xmath27 to square matrices by introducing rows / columns of zeros .",
    "conversely , if there are more dynamical variables at step @xmath25 than at step @xmath1 , we extend the matrices @xmath28 and @xmath27 by columns / rows of zeros and so forth .",
    "the following discussion therefore applies both to systems with temporally constant and temporally varying discretization ; it encompasses systems with temporally constant or varying numbers of dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "now consider the action for three such steps @xmath1 or two global moves @xmath29 and @xmath10 as in figure [ fig1 ] , i.e. [ 2step ] s(x_0,x_1,x_2)=s_1(x_0,x_1)+s_2(x_1,x_2 ) , where the individual @xmath30 are given by ( [ sk ] ) and we assume the @xmath31 to be ` bulk ' at step @xmath32 , while @xmath33 then define boundary data .",
    "we shall directly apply the formalism developed in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath30 are generating functions of the first kind and thus generate the momenta canonically conjugate to the @xmath9 .",
    "since each @xmath9 occurs in the two actions @xmath34 there will be two canonically conjugate momenta @xmath35 conjugate to every @xmath9 , which are called _",

    "if @xmath42 is degenerate , it must have the same number of left ( or transposed ) and right null vectors , ( l_n-1)^ic^n_ij=0,c^n_ij(r_n)^j=0.[leftright ] this leads to _ pre  constraints _ @xcite at @xmath43 and _ post  constraints _ @xcite at @xmath32 [ kincon1 ] ^-c^0=(l_0)^i(^-p^0_i+a^1_ijx^j_0),^+c^2=(r_2)^i(^+p^2_i - b^2_ijx^j_2 ) , respectively , and at step @xmath13 to the post and pre  constraints [ kincon ] ^+c^1=(r_1)^i(^+p^1_i - b^1_ijx^j_1),^-c^1=(l_1)^i(^-p^1_i + a^2_ijx^j_1 ) , respectively .",
    "in contrast to the continuum , we therefore have two types of constraint surfaces at each time step .",

    "every region , through its associated action , comes with its own set of propagating and gauge degrees of freedom , as well as constraints ; different regions will generally contain different dynamics and degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular , _ discretization changing evolution moves can be viewed as refining or coarse graining operations _ which necessarily change the dynamics .",
    "this is the origin for the move dependence of the classification of degrees of freedom .",
    "we shall see this in detail below for the case of quadratic discrete actions . for a more profound conceptual discussion of this move or region dependence",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the composition of the two moves @xmath29 and @xmath10 requires a momentum matching @xmath14 at @xmath13 , i.e.  the two sets of pre and post  constraints ( [ kincon ] ) , respectively , must _ both _ be imposed .",
    "constraints @xmath113 arising in the move @xmath10 now comprise conditions that must be satisfied by the canonical data of the move @xmath29 , while the post ",
    "constraints @xmath114 arising in the move @xmath29 now constitute conditions that must be fulfilled by the canonical data of the move @xmath10 .",
    "this leads to the following general constraint characterization ( for details see @xcite ) :    * a pre  constraint coincides with a post  constraint ( in possibly rewritten form ) , @xmath115 .",
    "it was generally shown in @xcite  and we shall see this specifically for quadratic actions below  that such a constraint generates a gauge symmetry . *",
    "a pre  constraint is independent of all post  constraints , but first class .",
    "such a pre  constraint can only arise during a _ coarse graining _ or _",
    "lattice shrinking _ time evolution : it constitutes a non - trivial _ coarse graining condition _ on the degrees of freedom which are dynamically relevant for @xmath29 and renders those which are ` finer ' than the coarse graining scale set by @xmath10 dynamically irrelevant for the latter @xcite . such a pre  constraint does _ not generate _ a symmetry , albeit being first class , but simply reduces the space of solutions by one canonical pair .",
    "the ( covariant ) phase space is then move dependent . *",
    "a post  constraint is independent of all pre  constraints , but first class .",
    "this is the time - reverse of ( b1 ) and only occurs in a _ refining _ or _ lattice growing _ time evolution .",
    "such a post  constraint thus does not generate a symmetry but enforces that the coarser data of @xmath29 can be consistently embedded in the finer data of @xmath10 .",
    "equivalently , it is a non - trivial coarse graining condition on the move @xmath10 and thereby further reduces the space of solutions or phase space associated to this move by one canonical pair . *",
    "a pre  constraint ( post  constraint ) is independent of the post  constraints ( pre  constraints ) , but is second class and fixes an orbit parameter of one of the latter .",
    "* a pre  constraint may be incompatible with _ all _ post  constraints ( or vice versa ) , yielding an inconsistent dynamics .",
    "we shall see shortly how the first four cases arise in the present context .    before we classify the constraints arising from quadratic discrete actions further according to the above classification of the null vectors ,",
    "let us generally determine when the pre and post  constraints of the present case are first or second class . to this end , we recall theorem 5.1 of @xcite , according to which the set of pre",
    " constraints @xmath116 , on the one hand , and the set of post ",
    "constraints @xmath114 , on the other , each form a first class poisson sub  algebra . in the present case",
    "this is an immediate consequence of the symmetry of the matrices @xmath117 and the sub ",

    "consequently , pre and post  constraints are first class if the corresponding left or right null vector is also a null vector of the hessian @xmath112 . in fact , in this case the corresponding constraints are _ abelian_. these first class constraints therefore generate symmetries of the three  step action ( [ 2step ] ) , @xmath111 .",
    "however , just like some null vectors of @xmath112 will fail to be null vectors of ` effective ' hessians upon inclusion of additional evolution steps , we shall see later in section [ sec_classeff ] that constraints of types ( 2)(a ) and ( 3)(a ) , which are first class for the problem defined by @xmath111 , will generally no longer be first class for a problem defined by ` effective ' actions for more time steps .",

    "in particular , not all quantum pre ",
    "observables at @xmath43 of the move @xmath29 survive as ` effective ' pre  observables of the move @xmath12 because the number of constraints which they have to commute with can increase .",
    "the analogous statement holds for quantum post ",

    "_ as seen at the end of section [ sec_unique ] , the effective action for the effective move @xmath12 of the scalar field on the growing square lattice is merely a boundary term with @xmath458 and a somewhat convoluted expression for @xmath459 which we abstain from showcasing explicitly .",

    "this result highlights the move or spacetime region dependence of physical hilbert spaces and propagating degrees of freedom . _",
    "quadratic discrete actions permit to explicitly solve all equations of motion and the corresponding quantum dynamics . in the present manuscript",
    "we have taken advantage of this and , firstly , classified constraints , equations of motion and degrees of freedom , arising from quadratic discrete actions , into eight types which distinguish between gauge modes and different kinds of propagating degrees of freedom .",
    "secondly , we performed the analogous discussion in the quantum theory .",
    "this analysis applies to variational discrete systems with both temporally varying or constant discretization .",
    "this article confirms the general results of @xcite and shows explicitly how changes in the discretization , deriving from dynamical coarse graining and refining operations , or a shrinking and growing lattice , lead to non - trivial changes in the dynamical content of the system .",
    "the classification of constraints and degrees of freedom becomes evolution move , and thus , in a spacetime context , spacetime region dependent .",
    "constraints , admitting the interpretation as coarse graining or refining conditions @xcite , can propagate under time evolution as consistency conditions to other time steps , for instance , to ensure that a finer discretization does not carry more dynamical information than a coarser discretization can support at another time step . composing evolution moves on temporally varying discretizations changes the reduced phase space and physical hilbert space at a given time step ; in particular , coarse graining or shrinking the spatial lattice leads to non - unitary projections of physical hilbert spaces",
    ".    nevertheless , the formalism and this classification are fully consistent .",
    "in fact , this formalism constitutes a canonical complement to the covariant coarse graining techniques developed in @xcite .",
    "it can be applied to arbitrary variational discrete systems governed by quadratic actions such as , for example , linearized 4d regge calculus @xcite . furthermore , while the present work focuses on technical aspects of the formalism , a forthcoming article @xcite , using fourier decomposition , will provide a more detailed physical discussion and interpretation specific to a scalar field on an evolving lattice .",

    "<S> we provide a comprehensive classification of constraints and degrees of freedom for variational discrete systems governed by quadratic actions . </S>",
    "<S> this classification is based on the different types of null vectors of the lagrangian two - form and employs the canonical formalism developed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is carried out in both the classical and quantum theory and applies to systems with both temporally varying or constant discretization . in particular , it is shown explicitly how changes in the discretization , e.g.  resulting from canonical coarse graining or refining operations or an evolving background geometry , change the dynamical content of the system . it is demonstrated how , on a temporally varying discretization , constraints , dirac observables , symmetries , reduced phase spaces and physical hilbert spaces become spacetime region dependent . </S>",
    "<S> these results are relevant for free field theory on an evolving lattice and linearized discrete gravity models . </S>"
