    "in recent years the present authors have reported a number of fixed - node dmc studies using trial wavefunctions whose determinantal part is built with the cipsi approach . @xcite the purpose of this paper is to review the present situation , to clarify some important aspects of dmc - cipsi , and to present some new illustrative results .    in section [ sci ]",
    "we briefly recall what configuration interaction ( ci ) methods are about and present the basic ideas of perturbatively selected ci approaches .",
    "we emphasize on the very high efficiency of sci in approaching the exact full ci limit using only a _",
    "tiny _ fraction of the full hilbert space of determinants . selecting important determinants being a natural idea ,",
    "it is no surprise that it has been introduced a long time ago and has been rediscovered many times under various forms since then . to the best of our knowledge selected ci appeared for the first time in 1969 in two independent works by bender and davidson@xcite and whitten and hackmeyer.@xcite in practice ,",
    "the flavor of sci we employ is the cipsi approach introduced by malrieu and collaborators in 1973.@xcite cipsi being our working algorithm for generating ci expansions , a brief description is given here .",
    "it is noted that the recent fci - qmc method of alavi _ et al._@xcite is essentially a sci approach , except that selection of determinants in fci - qmc",
    "is done stochastically instead of deterministically . in section [ results ] the performance of cipsi",
    "is illustrated for the case of the water molecule at equilibrium geometry using the cc - pcv@xmath0z family of basis sets , with @xmath1 to 5 and for the whole set of 55 molecules and 9 atoms of the g1 standard set.@xcite it is shown that in all cases the fci limit is closely approached .    in section [ dmc ]",
    "the use of cipsi nodes in dmc is discussed .",
    "we first present our motivations and then comment on the key result observed , namely that in all applications realized so far the fixed - node error associated with the approximate nodes of the cipsi expansion is found to systematically decrease both as a function of the number of selected determinants and as the size of the basis set .",
    "this remarkable property provides a convenient way of controlling the fixed - node error .",
    "let us emphasize that in contrast with common practice in qmc the molecular orbitals are not stochastically re - optimized here .",
    "an illustrative application to the water molecule is presented.@xcite of course , the main price to pay is the need of using much larger ci expansions than usual",
    ". the main ideas of our recently proposed approach@xcite to handle very large number of determinants in qmc are presented . in practice , converged dmc calculations using trial wavefunctions including up to a few millions of determinants are feasible .",
    "the computational increase with respect to single - determinant calculations is roughly proportional to @xmath2 with a small prefactor .    in section [ pseudo ]",
    "the implementation of effective core potentials ( ecp ) in dmc using cipsi trial wavefunctions is presented . as already proposed some time ago,@xcite ci expansions allow to calculate analytically the action of the nonlinear pseudo - potential operator on the trial wavefunction . in this way",
    ", the use of quadrature points to integrate the wavefunction over the sphere as usually done@xcite is avoided and a gain in computational effort essentially proportional to the number of grid points is achieved .",
    "the effectiveness of the approach is illustrated in the case of the atomization energy of the c@xmath3 molecule .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ conclu ] presents a detailed summary of the main features of the dmc - cipsi approach and some lines of research presently under investigation are mentioned .",
    "in configuration interaction the wavefunction is written as a sum of slater determinants @xmath4 where determinants are built over spin - orbitals .",
    "let @xmath5 be the set of @xmath6 orthonormal molecular orbitals used , the size of the full hilbert space is given by the number of ways of distributing the @xmath7 electrons among the orbitals times the corresponding number for @xmath8 electrons .",
    "the total size of the full ci space is then ( no symmetries are considered ) @xmath9 the ci eigenspectrum is obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix , @xmath10 within the orthonormal basis of determinants . in practice , the exponential increase of the fci space restricts the use of fci to small systems including a small number of electrons and molecular orbitals ( @xmath11 not greater than about @xmath12 ) . to go beyond",
    ", the fci expansion has to be truncated .",
    "the most popular strategy consists in defining a subspace of determinants chosen _",
    "a priori_. typically , the hartree - fock determinant ( or a few determinants ) is chosen as reference and all possible determinants built by promoting a given number of electrons from the hf occupied orbitals to the virtual ones are considered .",
    "in the cis approach only single excitations are considered , in cisd all single and double excitations , etc .     in the cc - pvtz basis",
    "set ( r@xmath13=1.0977  ) .",
    "variation of the number of determinants with @xmath0-excitations with respect to the hartree - fock determinant in the cipsi expansion as a function of the number of selected determinants up to @xmath14 . ]    now , numerical experience shows that among all possible determinants corresponding to a given number of excitations , only a _ tiny _",
    "fraction plays a significant role in constructing the properties of the low - lying eigenstates .",
    "furthermore , the weight of a determinant in the ci expansion is not directly related to its degree of excitation .",
    "for example , quadruply - excited determinants may play a more important role than some doubly- or singly - excited determinants .",
    "however , in practice , limiting the maximum number of excitations to about six is usually sufficient to get chemical accuracy . to give some quantitative illustration of these statements , figure [ n2 ] presents the number of determinants per class of excitations @xmath0 as a function of the number of determinants in the cipsi wavefunction for the @xmath15 molecule at equilibrium geometry ( cc - pvtz basis set ) . without entering now into the details of cipsi presented below ,",
    "let us just note that for 5@xmath16 determinants the cipsi expansion has almost converged to the fci solution .",
    "accordingly , results presented in the figure for the distribution of excitations is essentially that of the fci wavefunction .    as a consequence of the preceding remarks ,",
    "it is clear that it is desirable to find a way of selecting only the most important determinants of the fci expansion without considering all those of negligible weight ( the vast majority ) .",
    "this is the purpose of selected configuration interaction approaches .      to the best of our knowledge bender and davidson@xcite and whitten and hackmeyer@xcite",
    "were the first in 1969 to introduce and exploit the idea of selecting determinants in ci approaches . in their work bender and",
    "davison proposed to select space configuration using an energy contribution criterion . denoting @xmath17 the restricted hf csf - configuration , @xmath18 all possible spin configurations issued from the space configuration , and @xmath19 the `` average '' perturbative energy contribution ,",
    "the space configurations were ordered according to this contribution and those determinants contributing the most selected .",
    "the ci wavefunction was then constructed by using the selected configurations , @xmath17 , and all single excitations .",
    "a few months later , a similar idea using the very same perturbative criterion was introduced independently by whitten and hackmeyer.@xcite in addition , they proposed to improve step - by - step the ci expansion by iterating the selection step to reach the most important determinants beyond double - excitations .    in 1973 malrieu and collaborators@xcite presented the cipsi method ( and later on an improved version of it@xcite ) . in cipsi",
    "the construction of the multirefence variational space is essentially identical to that of whiten and hackmeyer .",
    "however , in order to better describe the dynamical correlation effects poorly reproduced by the multireference space , a perturbational calculation of the remaining correlation contributions was proposed . in applications",
    "the perturbational part is usually important from both a qualitative and quantitative point of view .",

    "+ @xmath20 step 2 : compute the small energy change of the total energy due to each connected determinant as evaluated at second - order perturbation theory @xmath31    @xmath20 step 3 : add the determinant @xmath32 associated with the largest @xmath33 to the reference subspace : @xmath34 + of course , instead of adding only one determinant a group of determinants can be selected using a threshold .",
    "this is what is actually done in practice .",
    "+ @xmath20 step 4 : diagonalize @xmath22 within @xmath35 to get : @xmath36    @xmath20 go to step 1 or stop if the target size for the reference subspace has been reached .",
    "+ denoting @xmath37 the final number of determinants , the resulting ground - state @xmath38 is the variational cipsi solution .",
    "it is the expansion used in dmc to contruct the determinantal part of the trial wavefunction .",
    "a second step in cipsi is the calculation of a perturbational estimate of the correlation energy left between the variational cipsi energy and the exact fci one . at second order",
    ", this contribution writes @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the set of all determinants not belonging to the reference space and connected to the cipsi expansion @xmath38 by @xmath22 ( single and double excitations only ) and @xmath41 the variational cipsi energy . in practice , this contribution allows to recover a major part of the remaining correlation energy .",

    "the cpu time required is essentially proportional to @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the number of occupied molecular orbitals and @xmath46 the number of virtual orbitals .",
    "as already pointed out selecting the most important determinants of the fci expansion is a so natural idea that , since the pioneering work of bender and davidson@xcite and whitten and hackmeyer,@xcite several variants of sci approaches have been proposed . in practice ,",
    "the actual differences between approaches are usually rather minor and most ideas and technical aspects seem to have been re - discovered several times by independent groups . to give a fair account of the subject and an exhaustive list of references is thus difficult .",

    "thanks to all this , cipsi has been extensively applied for years by several groups to a variety of accurate studies of ground and excited states and potential energy surfaces ( see , for example @xcite ) finally , note that in the last years our group has developped its own cipsi code , quantum package .",

    "in contrast with the exact full - ci approach which takes into account the entire set of determinants and is thus rapidly unfeasible , cipsi can be used for much larger systems .",
    "the exact limits depend of course on the size of the basis set used , the number of electrons , and also on the level of convergence asked for when approaching the full ci limit . to illustrate the feasibility of cipsi for larger systems we present systematic all - electron calculations for the g1 benchmark set of pople and collaborators.@xcite the set is composed of 55 molecules and 9 different atoms .",

    "are given either for canonical or natural orbitals .",
    "depending on the importance of the multiconfigurational character of the system , this number may vary considerably ( from a few tens to about 10@xmath86 ) .",
    "as expected , the number of determinants needed using natural orbitals is most of the times smaller and sometimes comparable . figure [ g1_2 ] is similar to the preceding figure , except that numbers are given now for a full cipsi calculation including the second - order energy correction and that a much greater accuracy corresponding to 99.9% of the correlation energy is targeted . as seen , it is remarkable that such a high precision can be reached for all systems with a number of determinants not exceeding @xmath87 . in contrast with variational calculations , it should be noted that the use of natural orbitals does not systematically improve the convergence .",
    "finally , some comparison with accurate ccsd(t ) calculations performed using the same basis sets and geometries are presented . in figure [ ccsdt ] the distribution of errors in atomization energies calculated with both ccsd(t ) and cipsi methods are plotted . for the cc - pvdz basis set , ccsd(t ) and",
    "cipsi curves are very similar , indicating that ccsd(t ) calculations have also reached the quasi full ci limit . for the larger cc - pvtz basis set , the two curves remain similar but some significant differences show up with cipsi results more distributed toward small errors due to a better description of multireference systems .        .",

    "in dmc the standard practice is to introduce compact trial wavefunctions reproducing as much as possible the mathematical and physical properties of the exact wave function .",
    "next , the `` best '' nodes are determined through optimization of the parameters of the trial wavefunction in a preliminary variational monte carlo ( vmc ) run .",
    "the objective function to minimize is either the variational energy associated with the trial wavefunction or the variance of the hamiltonian ( or a combination of both ) .",
    "a number of algorithms have been elaborated to perform this important practical step as efficiently as possible.@xcite no limitations existing in qmc for the choice of the functional form of the trial wavefunction , many different expressions have been introduced ( see , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) . however , the most popular one is certainly the jastrow - slater trial wavefunction expressed as a short expansion over a set of slater determinants multiplied by a global jastrow factor describing explicitly the electron - electron and electron - electron - nucleus interactions and , in particular , imposing the electron - electron cusp conditions associated with the zero - interelectronic distance limit of the true wavefunction .    in the dmc - cipsi approach the determinantal part of the trial wavefunction",
    "is built using systematic cipsi expansions .",
    "the main motivation is that ci approaches provide a simple , deterministic , and systematic way of constructing wavefunctions of controllable quality . in a given one - particle basis set ,",
    "the wavefunction is improved by increasing the number of determinants , up to the full ci ( fci ) limit .",
    "then , by increasing the basis set , the wavefunction can be further improved , up to the complete basis set ( cbs ) limit where the exact solution of the continuous electronic schrdinger equation is reached .",
    "the ci nodes , which are defined as the zeroes of the expansion , are also expected to follow such a systematic improvement , thus facilitating the control of the fixed - node error .",
    "a second important motivation is that the stochastic optimization step can be avoided since a systematic way of improving the wavefunction is now at our disposal .",
    "the optimal ci coefficients are obtained by the ( deterministic ) diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix in the basis set of slater determinants .",
    "it is a simple and robust step which leads to a unique set of coefficients .",
    "furthermore , it can be made automatic , an important feature in the perspective of designing a fully black - box qmc code . finally , using _ deterministically",
    "_ constructed nodal structures greatly facilitates the use of nodes evolving _ smoothly _ as a function of any parameter of the hamiltonian .",
    "it is important when calculating potential energy surfaces ( see , our application to the f@xmath3 molecule,@xcite ) or response properties under external fields .",
    "the main price to pay for such advantages is of course the need of considering much larger multideterminant expansions ( from tens of thousands up to a few millions ) than in standard dmc implementations where compactness of the trial wavefunction is searched for .",
    "however , efficient algorithms have been proposed to perform such calculations@xcite .",
    "very recently , we have also presented an efficient algorithm for computing very large ci expansions .",
    "its main ideas are briefly summarized in section [ largedets ] below .",
    "a remarkable property systematically observed so far in our dmc applications using large cipsi expansions@xcite is that , except for a possible transient regime at small number of determinants,@xcite the fixed - node error resulting from the use of cipsi nodes is found to decrease monotonically , both as a function of the number of selected determinants , @xmath88 , and of the basis set size , @xmath89 .",

    "the possibility of calculating fixed - node energies displaying such a regular behavior as a function of the number of determinants and molecular orbitals is clearly attractive in terms of control of the fixed - node error . for example , in our benchmark study of the water molecule@xcite it was possible to extrapolate the dmc energies obtained with each cc - pcvnz basis set as a function of the cardinal number @xmath0 , as routinely done in deterministic ci calculations . using a standard @xmath93 law a very accurate dmc - cipsi energy value of -76.43894(12 ) a.u .",
    "was obtained , in full agreement with the estimate exact value of -76.4389(1 ) a.u.@xcite    at this point , we emphasize that the observed property of systematic decrease of the energy as a function of the number of determinants is known not to be systematically true for a general ci expansion ( see , _",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    ", its validity may probably be attributed to the fact that determinants are selected in a hierarchical way ( the most important ones first ) , so that the wavefunctions quality increases step by step , and so the quality of nodes . however , from a mathematical point of view , such a property is far from being trivial .",
    "there is no simple argument why the fci nodes obtained from minimization of the _ variational _ energy with respect to the multideterminant coefficients would lead to the best nodal structure ( minimum of the _ fixed - node _ energy with respect to such coefficients ) . in a general space",

    "to demonstrate the validity or not of the observed property in a finite space of determinants built with molecular orbitals expanded in a finite basis set remains to be done .",

    "the number of unique spin - specific determinants is much smaller than @xmath88 and typically scales as @xmath95 .",
    "it is true for fci expansions where all possible determinants are considered .",
    "indeed , @xmath106 attains its maximal value of @xmath107 and since @xmath37 is given as @xmath100 , the number of unique spin - specific determinants @xmath108 is of order @xmath109 .",
    "however , it is in general also true for the usual truncated expansions ( casscf , cisd , etc . ) essentially because the numerous excitations implying multiple excitations of spin - like electrons plays a marginal role and have a vanishing weight .",
    "+ @xmath20 _ optimized sherman - morrison updates_. as proposed in a number of works,@xcite we calculate the determinants and their derivatives using the sherman - morrison ( sm ) formula for updating the inverse slater matrices .",
    "however , in contrast with other implementations , we have found more efficient not to compare the slater matrix to a common reference ( typically , the hartree - fock determinant ) but instead to perform the sherman - morrison updates with respect to the previously computed determinant @xmath110 . to reduce the prefactor associated with this step the list of determinants",
    "is sorted with a suitably chosen order so that with high probability successive determinants in the list differ only by one- or two - column substitution , thus decreasing the average number of substitution performed .",
    "+ @xmath20 _ exploiting high - performance capabilities of present - day processors_. this very practical aspect  which is in general too much underestimated  is far from being anecdotal since it allows us to gain important computational savings .",
    "a number of important features include the use of vector fused - multiply add ( fma ) instructions ( that is , the calculation of ` a = a+b*c ` in one cpu cycle ) for the innermost loops .",
    "it is extremely efficient and should be systematically searched for .",
    "using such instructions ( present in general - purpose processors ) , up to eight fma per cpu cycle can be performed in double precision . while computing loops , overheads are also very costly and should be reduced / eliminated . by taking care separately of the various parts of the loop ( peeling loop , scalar loop , vector loop , and tail loop ) through size - specific and/or hard - coded subroutines , a level of 100% vectorized loops",
    "is reached in our code .",
    "another crucial point is to properly manage the data flow arriving to the processing unit .",
    "as known , to be able to move data from the memory to the cpu with a sufficiently high data transfer to keep the cpu busy is a major concern of modern calculations .",
    "then , it is not only important to make maximum use of the low - latency cache memories to store intermediate data but also to maximize prefetching allowing the processor to anticipate the use of the right data and instructions in advance . to enhance prefetching the algorithm should allow the predictability of the data arrival in the cpu ( that is , avoid random access as much as possible ) .",
    "it is this important aspect that has motivated us to use sherman - morrison updates , despite the fact that a method like the table method@xcite has formally a better scaling . indeed , massive calculations of scalar products at the heart of repeated uses of sm updates are so ideally adapted to present - day processors that very high performances can be obtained .",
    "+ @xmath20 _ improved truncation scheme .",
    "_ instead of truncating the ci expansion according to the magnitude of the multideterminant coefficients as usual done , we propose instead to remove spin - specific determinants according to their total contribution to the norm of the expansion . in this way , more determinants can be handled for a price corresponding to shorter expansions . to be more precise ,",
    "we first observe that truncating the wavefunction according to the magnitude of coefficients has the effect of removing elements of the sparse matrix @xmath99 of eq.([eq : main ] ) .",
    "a reduction of the computational cost occurs only when a full line ( @xmath104 ) or a full column ( @xmath105 ) of @xmath99 contains only zeroes , in that case the determinant @xmath111 can be removed from the calculation .",
    "now , by expressing the norm of the wave function as @xmath112 it is possible to assign a contribution to the norm to each determinant .",
    "then , all determinants whose contribution to the norm is below some threshold will be removed from the expansion .",
    "this truncation scheme allows to eliminate the smallest number of coefficients needed to obtain some computational gain .",
    "moreover , the size - consistence property of the wave function is expected to be approximately preserved by such a truncation : when a @xmath113-determinant is removed , it is equivalent to removing the product of @xmath111 with all the @xmath114-determinants of the wave function .",
    "when using pseudopotentials a valence hamiltonian is defined @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the local part describing the kinetic energy , the coulombic repulsion and the local part of the effective core potentials ( ecp ) . @xmath117 and @xmath118 the non - local part written as @xmath119 where @xmath120 is a radial pseudopotential , @xmath121 is the spherical harmonic , @xmath122 labels pseudo - ions .",

    ", the integrals involved can not be computed analytically .",
    "the standard solution is to evaluate them numerically using some quadrature for the sphere .",
    "here , the ci form allows to perform the integration exactly , as already proposed some time ago.@xcite note that although no jastrow prefactor is used here when localizing the pseudo - potential operator , such a prefactor can still be used for the dmc simulation itself .",
    "a first advantage is that the calculation is significantly faster : in practice , the computational cost is the same as evaluating the laplacian of the wave function and a gain proportional to the number of quadrature points is obtained .",
    "a second advantage is the possibility of a better control of the localization error by increasing the number of determinants .    to illustrate these statements ,",

    "the exact practical limits depend of course on the size of the basis set used , the number of active electrons , and also on the level of convergence asked for when approaching the full ci limit . in this work",
    ", the cipsi approach has been exemplified with near - fci quality all - electron calculations for the water molecule using a series of basis sets of increasing size up to the cc - pcv5z basis set and for the whole set of 55 molecules and 9 atoms of the benchmark g1 set ( cc - pvdz basis set ) . in each case , the huge size of the fci space forbids exact fci calculations .",
    "cipsi has been applied to larger systems , for example for calculating accurate total energies for the atoms of the @xmath139 series,@xcite and for obtaining near - fci quality results for the cucl@xmath3 molecule ( calculations including 63 electrons and 25 active valence electrons).@xcite note that by using effective core potentials as described in section [ pseudo ] even larger systems can be treated .",

    "cipsi expansions can be used as determinantal part of the trial wavefunctions employed in dmc calculations . in others",
    "words , we propose to use selected ci nodes as approximation of the unknown exact nodes .",
    "the basic motivation is that ci approaches provide a simple , deterministic , and systematic way to build wavefunctions of controllable quality . in a given one - particle basis set",

    "a particularly important example is the possibility of obtaining regular potential energy surface ( pes ) .",
    "this idea has been illustrated in a previous work on the potential energy curve of the f@xmath3 molecule.@xcite furthermore , it is also possible to reduce the `` non - parallelism '' error resulting from the use of a trial wavefunction of non - uniform quality across the pes .",
