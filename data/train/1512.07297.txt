    "electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite is a quantum interference phenomenon that takes place when two laser fields excite resonantly and two different transitions share a common state . since its experimental realization @xcite",
    ", eit has made valuable contributions in the development of optical sciences because of its promising applications in multidisciplinary fields @xcite .",
    "for instance , eit has appeared as fundamental ingredient for the real applications like group velocity control @xcite , nonlinear susceptibility modulation @xcite , quantum information processing @xcite , quantum metrology @xcite , dark - state polariton @xcite , induced photon - photon interaction in cold atomic gases @xcite , rydberg atomic - state detection @xcite , cavity linewidth narrowing @xcite and laser frequency stabilization @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the studies on the eit have been extended to multi - level atomic systems interacting with multiple laser fields @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that multiple eit windows occur in the probe absorption spectrum in the multi - level atomic systems @xcite , whose absorption profiles of a weak probe field are different from that of three - level @xmath0-system @xcite . up to now , multiple eit windows have been reported in various multi - level atomic systems , such as @xmath1-type @xcite , @xmath2-type @xcite , @xmath3-type @xcite and @xmath4-type @xcite atomic systems . unlike single eit phenomenon , multiple eit windows allow transmission of the probe field at multiple different frequencies simultaneously @xcite",
    ". such multiple eit phenomenon could be useful for promising applications in multi - channel optical communication , waveguides for optical signal processing and multichannel quantum information processing .",
    "recently , significant theoretical and experimental efforts @xcite have been made to utilize radiation pressure forces in order to probe and to manipulate micro / nano - scale mechanical objects , which have paved the way for a number of new types of optomechanical systems . amongst these ,",
    "guided wave nanostructures in which large gradients in the optical intensity are manifest , have been shown to possess extremely large radiation pressure effects @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the recent demonstration of strongly interacting photonic and phononic resonances in a quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) optomechanical crystal @xcite has shown that it may be possible to coherently control phonons , photons , and their interactions on an integrated , chipscale platform .",
    "on the other hand , the waveguide optomechanical interface possess a unique combination of high sensitivity , broad bandwidth , high quality single - crystal materials , and high @xmath5 , and has potential to allow measurement of quantum motion of nanobeam resonances @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the pump - probe response for the optomechanical ( hybrid ) systems shares the properties of paradigmatic @xmath0-type ( multi - level ) system , and displays eit @xcite and double eit phenomena @xcite .",
    "more recently , huang and tsang @xcite , have shown multiple eit - windows with @xmath3 membranes in optomechanics .",
    "our present work is based on hybrid quantum optomechanics with three - level @xmath0-type atomic ( tla ) system . in this paper",
    ", we report that : ( i ) multiple ( three ) tunable eit windows exist in the hybrid system containing single tla .",
    "( ii ) the presence of tla in the system uniquely provides us coherent control to switch from multiple to double and single eit windows in a single experimental setup .",
    "( iii ) we study the probe field transmission , and explain the occurence of slow and fast light regimes via multiple interferences .",
    "( iv ) in addition , we explain the enhancement of superluminal behaviour of probe field in the hybrid system by controlling the system parameters .",
    "( v ) the parametric values of the hybrid system used in our study are realizable in present - day laboratory experiments .",
    "our analytical and numerical results obtained for these experimental parametric values show very good agreement .",
    "we consider a realistic hybrid cavity qed - optomechanical system , where a single cavity field mode is coupled both to a mechanical resonator as well as interacts with the @xmath0-type three - level atom ( tla ) between the transitions @xmath6 . a strong laser field of frequency @xmath7 , and a weak probe field of frequency @xmath8 , simultaneously drive the optical cavity of length @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , a classical laser field with frequency @xmath10 induces the atomic transition @xmath11 with coupling parameter @xmath12 , which serves as a control field for the atom .",

    "[ eit1 ] , we show the absorption ( @xmath33 ) and dispersion ( @xmath69 ) profiles as a function of the normalized detuning @xmath79 .",
    "the parameter @xmath80 describes the probe detuning from the line centre . in the presence of optomechanical coupling ( @xmath13 ) , and transition coupling parameters of the tla , @xmath12 and @xmath14",
    ", we show that three distinct ( multiple ) eit windows occur in the absorption profile as shown in fig .",
    "[ eit1 ] . in the presence of intense pump laser ,",
    "the two transition coupling parameters @xmath12 and @xmath14 contribute together in the emergence of multiple transparency windows . for @xmath81 mhz ,",
    "we see that the separation between the dark lines in fig .",
    "[ eit1](a , b ) is same .",
    "however , for @xmath82 mhz and @xmath83 mhz , the central peaks become narrow whereas side peaks in the absorption profile broadens as shown in fig .",
    "[ eit1 ] ( c , d ) . in fig .",
    "[ eit1 ] ( e , f ) , we see that the central peaks broaden and side peaks become closer in the absorption and dispersion profile for @xmath84 mhz and @xmath85 . hence , in addition to the coupling parameter @xmath13 , the power of the pump laser @xmath86 or @xmath38 @xcite , the multiple eit windows in fig .",
    "[ eit1 ] , can be controlled with transition coupling parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 of the three - level atom .",
    "the emergence of multiple eit windows in hybrid optomechanics can be understood analytically as we examine the structure of the output field . as compared with the situation of single cavities @xcite or hybrid qubit - cavity systems @xcite , and keeping in view the structure of eqs .",
    "( 3 - 5 ) , we note that @xmath89 and @xmath90 are modified .",
    "hence , for the case of @xmath91 , the numerator of the output field becomes cubic in @xmath92 . unlike in the case of single cavity @xcite and two - level atom - cavity hybrid system @xcite",
    ", there exists three roots in the present case .",
    "the third root occurs due to the presence of the tla in the hybrid system , which has additional interfering pathway via coupling @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , we observe three distinct multiple eit windows in the absorption profile , as shown in fig .",
    "[ eit1](a , c , e ) . here",
    "each of the three roots indicates the location of the three minima for multiple eit windows .",
    "thus , analytically the structure of the output field confirms the splitting of usual eit window into multiple distinct eit windows .",
    "the three windows occur at resonances @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and for @xmath95 . in fig .",
    "[ eit1 ] , we see that by tuning the coupling parameters @xmath12 and @xmath14 , width of the multiple eit windows can be controlled .",
    "in addition , the atom ( tla ) contributes in the multiple interference , since @xmath96 as well as @xmath97 and @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "hence , the interference between the subsystems , namely ; two transition coupling parameters of the atom , moving mirror , pump and probe fields respectively , corresponding to @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath23 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 causes the splitting of single eit window , and emergence of multiple eit windows .",
    "therefore , dispersion in the output field changes from normal to anomalous @xcite .",
    "we also note that the presence of tla provides a unique opportunity to switch from three to double and single eit windows in a controllable fashion in a single experimental setup . for instance , as we switch off the transition @xmath14 as @xmath102 , we observe that the resonant character of the probe field changes from three eit windows to double eit windows ( see fig .  [ trans ] ) .",
    "this reduces the system to hybrid optomechanical system with a two - level atom as reported in ref .",
    "the convergence of three windows into two windows is obvious as the structure of output field changes in a manner that its numerator and denominator goes one degree down .",
    "hence , we can obtain the double eit window for the case when @xmath102 .",
    "similarly , multiple eit windows can be transformed to a single eit window if transition coupling parameters @xmath12 and @xmath14 are gradually switched off .",
    "if we adjust both atomic transition couplings as @xmath102 and @xmath103 , the system reduces to a single ended cavity , and a single eit window occurs in the probe absorption . likewise ,",
    "if all the coupling parameters are gradually switched off , i.e. @xmath104 and @xmath105 , the multi peaks in the absorption profile converge to a single peak , and a standard lorentzian absorption peak appears with a full width at @xmath106 , in agreement with a previous report @xcite .",
    "hence , the presence of @xmath0-type atomic system in the optomechanical system manifests a unique opportunity to coherently control and tune the multiple eit windows in a single experimental setup by adjusting the system parameters .",
    "this technique demonstrate great potential in promising application , for instance , multi - channel waveguides for optical signal processing , delay lines and optical buffers for telecommunication , quantum information processing and quantum metrology @xcite .",
    "in this section , we investigate the probe field transmission in hybrid optomechanical system with a @xmath0-type tla . in the former section",
    ", we note that the second term on the right side in expression ( [ out ] ) corresponds to the output field at probe frequency @xmath8 with detuning @xmath107 .",
    "thus , the transmission of the probe field , which is the ratio of the returned probe field from the coupling system divided by the sent probe field @xcite , is given as @xmath108     of the probe field as a function of normalized probe detuning @xmath109 is presented : ( a ) for @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , multiple ( three ) transparency windows occur in the probe transmission ( dot - dashed curve ) .",
    "( b ) for @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath113 , double transparency windows occur ( dashed curve ) .",
    "( c ) for @xmath110 , @xmath114 , single transparency window occur ( dotted curve ) .",
    "( d ) for @xmath115 , lorentzian curve is obtained ( solid curve ) .",
    "all parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ eit1].,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    moreover , for an optomechanical system , in the resonant region of the transparency window , the probe field suffers a rapid phase dispersion , viz .",
    "@xmath116 $ ] .",
    "this rapid phase change @xmath117 causes the transmission group delay given as @xcite , @xmath118\\}}{d\\omega_p}.\\ ] ] in the above expression , we note that the magnitude of group delay depends upon the rapid phase dispersion in the transmitted probe field .",
    "moreover , the negative phase change indicates the anomalous dispersion which corresponds to @xmath119 indicating the superluminal ( fast light ) propagation of probe field . on the other hand ,",
    "the positive slope in the probe phase change expresses the normal dispersion with @xmath120 , which indicates the slow light propagation .",
    "therefore , higher the phase dispersion , the more change in the group delay which leads to strongly altered group velocity @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ trans ] , we present the transmission spectrum of the probe field as a function of the normalized probe detuning @xmath109 . in the presence of three - level atom in the system , we see that multiple ( three ) narrow transparency windows appear in the probe transmission for @xmath121 mhz , @xmath122 mhz as shown in fig .",
    "[ trans](a ) .",
    "however , if we adjust the transition coupling between atomic levels @xmath35 and @xmath123 as @xmath124 , the probe transmission displays double transparency windows as shown in fig .",
    "[ trans](b ) . in a similar controllable fashion ,",
    "if we adjust both atomic transition couplings as @xmath125 and @xmath124 , there occur single transparency window in the probe transmission as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ trans](c ) .",
    "the occurence of double and single transperacy windows is obvious as the system reduces to a hybrid system with two - level atom for @xmath126 and single ended cavity for @xmath127 , respectively .",
    "however , if we keep optomechanical coupling as switched off ( @xmath104 ) along with @xmath127 , the probe transmission shows lorentzian apsorption curve as shown in fig .",
    "[ trans](d ) .     of the probe field as a function of normalized probe detuning @xmath109 , in the presence of three - level atom is shown .",
    "all parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ eit1].,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    interestingly , we see that the ( transparent ) multiple subluminal peaks and multiple superluminal dips simultaneously appear in the transmission of probe field around both sides of the resonance @xmath128 . in fig .",
    "[ ph1 ] , we plot the phase of the transmitted probe field in the presence of three - level atom in the system for @xmath129 . we see that the phase dispersion curve in fig .",
    "[ ph1 ] represents anomalous dispersion with a significantly high dispersion as compare to the case of single two - level atom - cavity system @xcite .",
    "since , in the context of fast and slow light , the high phase dispersion is advantageous as it greatly alter the group index of the medium , through which a probe pulse will propagate with strongly altered group velocity @xcite .",
    "therefore , we anticipate that the larger pulse advancement can be obtained in the present case .    in fig",
    ".  [ delay ] , the group delay @xmath130 is plotted as a function of the pump power @xmath86 with @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "we see that the group delay is positive , which indicates the superluminal propagation ( fast light effect ) of the probe field . for the experimental realizable parameters , we obtain the pulse advancement of the order @xmath133 for @xmath134 mhz .",
    "however , previously pulse advancement of the order @xmath135 has been reported for the case of two - level atom @xcite .",
    "hence , as compared to the case of single cavities and two - level atom @xcite , the presence of tla causes higher phase dispersion .",
    "consequently , here we achieve significantly higher group delay as expected .    ) as a function of the pump power ( @xmath136 ) for the case of @xmath94 , indicating the superluminal propagation ( pulse advancement ) of the transmitted probe field .",
    "rest of the parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ eit1].,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the enhanced fast light media have direct applications in real quality imaging @xcite , and temporal cloaking devices @xcite that require strong manipulation of the dispersion relation , where we can envision temporally cloaking various spatial regions of an image for different durations .",
    "similarly , by suitably adjusting the system parameters around the subluminal peaks , the probe phase turns from anomalous to normal .",
    "this reflects that the group delay changes sign from negative to positive , yielding the subluminal propagation in the probe transmission .",
    "thus , we infer that the superluminal behaviour of the probe field can further be enhanced by utilizing the hybridization of @xmath0-type atomic system in optomechanics . hence ,",
    "by employing both coupling parameters of tla simultaneously , we achieve the high phase dispersion which leads to the higher pulse advancement than single - ended cavities and hybrid two - level atom - cavity system @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have explained the multiple eit phenomenon and probe field transmission in hybrid optomechanics with a three - level @xmath0-type atomic system .",
    "we provide full analytical model to study the absorption , dispersion and transmission profiles of the probe field .",
    "it is shown that : ( i ) in the presence of tla in the system , the optomechanical coupling and the two transition coupling parameters of tla causes the three multiple eit windows in the probe absorption spectrum .",
    "( ii ) by appropriately adjusting the system parameters , we can switch from multiple to double and single eit windows .",
    "( iii ) we study the probe transmission spectrum under wide range of system parameters .",
    "the multiple transparency windows in probe transmission simultaneously indicates transparent subluminal peaks and superluminal dips , which causes the high phase dispersion .",
    "( iv ) the combined effect of the optomechanical and two transition coupling parameters of tla , give rise to the enhancement of superluminal behaviour of probe field in the hybrid system .",
