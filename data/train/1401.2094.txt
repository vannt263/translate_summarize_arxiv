    ", the inverse slope approaches a subthreshold swing value of @xmath42 , very close to the theoretical limit of @xmath2.[fig : fet_subswing ] ]",
    "in the subthreshold region , where the gate voltage is below the threshold voltage , the formation of a pinch - off zone with a very low charge carrier density near the drain contact leads to a suppression of the drift current .",
    "the large gradient of the charge concentration between the source and drain contact regions , however , gives rise to a diffusion current which is independent of the drain voltage , as long as the drain voltage is larger than a few @xmath43.@xcite the subthreshold current is proportional to the carrier concentration , which varies exponentially with the gate voltage .",

    "while @xmath52 does not express itself in the dc transfer characteristics , @xmath50 affects the subthreshold swing .",
    "rolland et .",
    "al.@xcite have shown it to be directly dependent on the density of deep trap states in the bulk and at the interface : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the bulk trap density per volume and energy , @xmath55 denotes the interface trap density per unit area and energy and @xmath56 is the permittivity of the semiconductor material .    for an ideal transistor without any traps ,",
    "@xmath50 is zero and the parameter @xmath46 equals @xmath57 .",
    "thus , there is a theoretical limit for the subthreshold swing , given by @xmath58 which is @xmath59 at @xmath39 .    for a real semiconductor , however , the subthreshold swing is larger than this minimum and the difference between the theoretical minimum and the measured subthreshold swing is a measure of the imperfection of the transistor interface and the semiconductor material .    from the subthreshold swing alone , it is not _ a priori _ possible to distinguish between trapping at the interface and trapping in the depletion zone of the bulk , since both contribute to an effective capacitance @xmath50 , corresponding to a trap concentration per _",
    "unit area_. however , we can estimate the maximum density of interface traps contributing to the measured subthreshold swing by setting @xmath54 to zero : @xmath60 if at least part of the trap states are located in the bulk , a reasonable assumption for the channel thickness is necessary to convert the areal density into a volume density . in general",
    ", this thickness is given by the debye length @xmath61 , which was also used in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : csc]).@xcite again , by setting @xmath62 we obtain the maximum contribution of bulk traps : @xmath63 care must be taken when the above relations are applied to nearly trap - free semiconductors or to very thin semiconducting layers as in evaporated or solution - processed fets .",
    "for such devices , @xmath64 can be of the same order as the semiconductor thickness @xmath65 and the charge carriers accumulate almost uniformly throughout the semiconductor . in this situation ,",
    "the charge transport in the subthreshold region is essentially a volume phenomenon rather than an accumulation of charge carriers within the first few monolayers of the semiconductor@xcite .",
    "if the characteristic thickness of the conducting channel @xmath64 is larger than @xmath65 , the relation ( [ eqn : nbulkmax ] ) is no longer valid to extract the maximum bulk trap density . from the measured subthreshold swing and the device geometry",
    ", one can directly asses if @xmath66 by rewriting the debye length @xmath64 in terms of @xmath22 : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the thickness and @xmath69 the permittivity of the gate dielectric .",
    "noteworthy , the borderline @xmath70 is equivalent to the situation where the trap related effective capacitance @xmath50 equals the geometric capacitance @xmath52 .",
    "if the debye length @xmath64 exceeds the crystal thickness @xmath65 , the analysis of @xmath22 in terms of trap density is slightly modified : @xmath71 and accordingly the maximum bulk trap density is @xmath72    after this discussion it is clear that from a physical point of view the as measured subthreshold swing @xmath22 is not suitable for a direct comparison between different fets . sometimes the subthreshold swing multiplied by the gate capacitance has been used for this purpose , but this value still depends on the geometry of the gate dielectric and gives no information about the intrinsic properties of the material . the key quantity to evaluate and compare the quality of the semiconductor and its interface to the dielectric is the capacitance of the transport channel @xmath50 obtained from @xmath22 according to eqs . and .",
    "not only can we extract the density of trap states dominating the subthreshold region , but also their energy relative to the transport level using the following considerations .",
    "the subthreshold current is dominated by diffusion and given by:@xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the width and length of the channel , @xmath64 is the channel thickness and @xmath76 is the diffusion coefficient which is connected to the mobility @xmath77 by the einstein relation @xmath78 . since in the subthreshold regime",
    "the concentrations of mobile charges near the source , @xmath79 , and the drain , @xmath80 , differ by several orders of magnitude , we set @xmath81 . furthermore , if the fermi level lies several @xmath82 away from the transport level , @xmath79 is given by maxwell - boltzmann statistics : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the number of states in the transport level and @xmath85 is the fermi energy relative to the transport level @xmath86 .",
    "again , we consider the two situations where the characteristic channel thickness given by the debye length @xmath61 is either smaller or larger than the geometric thickness @xmath65 of the semiconductor . for @xmath87 , combining eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : subthr_current ] ) and ( [ eqn : boltzmann ] ) results in @xmath88 and the density of bulk traps per unit energy @xmath89 can be obtained from the subthreshold swing by using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nbulkmax ] ) .",
    "@xmath90 is the drain current for which the minimal subthreshold swing is reached .",
    "if on the other hand the debye length exceeds the thickness of the semiconducting layer @xmath91 we obtain @xmath92    with equation ( [ eqn : trap_depth ] ) or ( [ eqn : trap_depth2 ] ) the fermi energy and thus the energy of the deep trap states filled upon turn - on can be estimated directly from macroscopic values .",
    "we note in passing that the deepest @xmath93 that can be probed is directly given by @xmath82 and shows a logarithmic dependence on the device geometry and the lowest measurable current ( limited by noise level or off scurrent ) .",
    "therefore , optimizing these parameters gives access to deeper trap states .",
    "the analytical method discussed in the previous sections is convenient to estimate the density of deep trap states .",
    "its derivation@xcite , however , is fairly involved , and it is desirable to assess the validity of this model in detail .",
    "we perform a series of numerical simulations of the fet s subthreshold current assuming a wide range of bulk trap densities , and we compare the resulting subthreshold swing with the values predicted by the analytical model ( eq . [ eqn : nbulkmax ] ) .    for the numerical calculations , a new in - house implementation of a fet model",
    "is used : it solves the drift- and diffusion equations in the presence of traps , similar to previous simulators.@xcite the differential equations are solved in two dimensions for the entire operating regime of the transistor and the trap dos can be chosen arbitrarily .",

    "this system of non - linear differential equations is discretized into finite differences and solved for the steady - state ( i.e. @xmath103 ) in two dimensions , using the gauss - newton algorithm .",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions are used to fix the potential and the charge carrier density at the injecting contacts .",
    "the interface to the insulating gate dielectric is determined by the neumann boundary condition @xmath104 , and the electric fields in the semiconductor and the insulator are connected by gauss law , @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the unit vector orthogonal to the interface plane and @xmath107 is the sheet density of additional charge at the interface . for the simulations discussed here we set @xmath108 .",
    "the concentration of mobile and trapped charge carriers is determined by a convolution of the density of states with the fermi - dirac distribution for holes : @xmath109    @xmath110    where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the spectral distribution of band - like ( mobile ) states and traps , respectively . from eqs .",

    "since we are focussing on the subthreshold region only , we assume for simplicity a constant trap dos in the energy range relevant at the turn - on voltage . this approximation is reasonable far away from the transport level , as has been measured in previous studies on single - crystal and thin film ofets , where the trap dos changes by a factor of @xmath117 within a few @xmath82.@xcite     simulated transfer curves emphasizing the broadening of the subthreshold swing upon increase of the bulk trap dos .",

    "extraction of the bulk trap dos from the subthreshold swing : comparison of the simulated subthreshold swing ( symbols ) and the corresponding prediction by the analytical model ( lines ) as function of the bulk trap density and for a range of temperatures . in the region below the dashed line ,",
    "the debye length @xmath64 is shorter than the semiconductor thickness , i.e. the characteristic channel thickness is limited by device geometry . for decreasing trap density",
    ", the values of @xmath22 approach their theoretical minimum for the trap - free case , indicated by the ( rounded ) numbers in the bottom left corner . ]",
    "the measured low subthreshold swing of @xmath42 ( figs . [",
    "fig : fet_transfer ] and [ fig : fet_subswing ] ) is a direct consequence of an exceptionally low density of deep traps ( table [ tab : parameters ] ) .",
    "assuming all the measured trap states to be located at the interface , we calculate a @xmath120 of @xmath121 .",
    "we compare this density to the number of rubrene molecules at the interface : the lattice parameters of an orthorhombic rubrene crystal are @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124,@xcite leading to a density of @xmath125 unit cells per @xmath126 in the b - c - plane ( according to the crystallographic axis - definition ) and thus to a molecule density of @xmath127 . therefore , the deep trap density per @xmath128 is less than 1 in @xmath129 molecules . alternatively ,",
    "if we we assume all the traps to be distributed throughout the bulk , the same reasoning leads to a density of defects electronically active far away from the transport level of 1 in @xmath5 molecules per @xmath130 .    considering the rather limited chemical purity of the source material ( 98% ) ,",
    "the density of measured defects is remarkably low .",
    "this manifests the efficient purification during growth of the crystal by physical vapor transport .",
    "furthermore , the equivalent interface trap density of only @xmath6 compares very favorably with the best crystalline sio@xmath131/si interfaces , where @xmath55 is in the range of 10@xmath132 ( to the best of our knowledge@xcite ) .    at turn - on , where the subthreshold swing and thus the trap density has been determined , the fermi level is calculated to be @xmath133 above the transport level ( eq . [ eqn : trap_depth2 ] ) .",
    "these results indicate that the bulk of the rubrene single crystal is almost defect free , owing to the growth process by physical vapor transport .",
    "also , in contrast to inorganic crystalline semiconductors , no dangling bonds are present on the surface of the van der waals bonded molecular crystal , which in turn leads to no additional charge traps .",
    "furthermore , the small density of traps per molecule at the surface suggest that any possible intrinsic surface states associated with the termination of a perfectly defect free crystal lattice do not result in a localization of charge carriers . in general , chemical or physical adsorption of molecules to either the cytop or rubrene is suppressed by their inert surface properties .",
    ".results and parameters relevant for the extraction deep trap density in the measured rubrene single crystal fet . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the methodic aspect , these measurements are of particular interest because the calculated debye length of @xmath134 places this device in the parameter space where the channel thickness at turn - on is limited by the crystal thickness ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the comparison of the analytical dos extraction method with the numerical simulations reveals good general agreement in a broad range of bulk trap densities and temperatures ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_extraction ] ) .",
    "not surprisingly , the small deviations are most pronounced near the borderline at which we distinguish between the situations of a characteristic channel length shorter or larger than the actual semiconductor thickness . however , even in this region the difference in @xmath54 is at most half an order of magnitude , indicating that this method is well suited also for ofets with a nearly trap - free interface and bulk , or with a very thin semiconducting layer .",
    "the rubrene fets in this study have an extremely low density of deep trap states , indicating the high quality of the semiconductor . here ,",
    "this quality is seen in an unprecedentedly low subthreshold swing of @xmath35 at room temperature , which lies remarkably close to the theoretical trap free limit at @xmath59 .",
    "an analytical method is shown to be well suited to experimentally access the density of deep bulk and interface traps from the subthreshold region of fet transfer curves .",
    "this method was verified by a comparison to numerical simulations of the subthreshold current .",
    "a novel way to estimate the trapping energies was presented which additionally provides the energy range dominating the subthreshold region .    with this in - depth analysis",
    "we estimate a trap density of @xmath3 , or equivalently @xmath6 , at @xmath135 above the transport level .",
    "thus , the deep trap densities in the best organic single crystal fets can be lower than in the most advanced crystalline sio@xmath131/si transistor ( @xmath136.@xcite ) .",
    "this may come as a surprise considering the flip - crystal fabrication of the ofets which does not involve any uhv equipment .",
    "in fact , the low trap density is an immediate consequence of the electronically inert and chemically stable surface of the van der waals bonded molecular organic semiconductors as well as their intrinsically trap - free interface with the gate dielectric .",
    "these highly pure crystals are a promising base for further studies of the intrinsic electronic properties of organic semiconductors .",
