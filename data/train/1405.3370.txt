    "the coupling between the central region and the buffers is given by the tunneling matrix elements @xmath82 . ]    in  @xcite we have introduced the concept of embedding which enables to replace the infinite system ( central region + left and right electrodes ) by a finite open system whose reduced density matrix is governed by the lindblad master equation .",
    "the main idea is to divide each electrode into two parts : an infinite environment and a sufficiently large but finite buffer between the central region and the environment .",
    "then , projecting out the environment degrees of freedom and employing the born - markov approximation , we obtain the lindblad master equation   for the density matrix of the embedded system ( central region + left and right buffers , see fig .  [ system ] ) .",

    "@xmath71 is diagonal @xmath101 while the parts of the liouvillian responsible for electron - phonon correlations and the coupling between the central region and the buffers read as @xmath102    + i\\widetilde\\beta\\hat\\beta\\hat\\gamma^\\dag - ( \\mathrm{t.c.})\\bigr\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath103 respectively . in",

    "are product of bosonic and fermionic creation superoperators .",
    "more specifically the index @xmath105 becomes the set of occupation numbers , @xmath106 and the generic multiconfigurational creation superoperators @xmath58 is given by @xmath107 moreover , from the structure of @xmath108 and @xmath109 it follows that in each @xmath58 the number of non - tilde fermionic superoperators should be equal to the number of tilde ones , i.e. , @xmath110    due to the phonon subsystem the number of possible multiconfigurational excitations is infinite .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath108 involves terms with two annihilation superoperators the expansion   terminates after the second order commutators . therefore , for the considered problem , the exact cluster superoperator @xmath56 is given by the solution of the infinite system of coupled quadratic nonlinear equations .    in the present work we restrict our consideration by the cluster correlation superoperator @xmath111 and @xmath112 which includes only terms linear with respect to phonon creation superoperators",
    "the superoperator @xmath111 is quadratic in terms of fermion creation superoperators @xmath113 while @xmath114 contains four - fermion components @xmath115 here , to simplify the notations , we omit the index @xmath116 implying that the summation is performed over the states in the left and right buffers , i.e. , @xmath117 . substituting @xmath111 or @xmath112 into",

    "we express the current superoperator in eq .   in terms of uncorrelated creation and annihilation superoperators .",
    "we get @xmath129 thus , the steady - state current is expressed through the cluster amplitudes @xmath130 . on the other hand , with the above relation the first equation in   becomes @xmath131 therefore , we can say that the first equation in   guaranties the current conservation . moreover , it can be easily shown that this equation is exact in the sense that the inclusion of extra terms in @xmath132 does not modify it .",
    "consequently , the presented coupled cluster approach for the charge transport problem is a current conserving one .      in our numerical calculations",
    "the left and right electrodes are represented by two semi - infinite tight - binding chains of sites .",
    "the coupling between the central region and the edge sites is given by the matrix elements  @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "each electrode is characterized by the hopping matrix element  @xmath135 and the on - site energy  @xmath136 .",
    "we choose the following parameters : @xmath137 , @xmath138 and the temperature @xmath139 .",
    "additionally , we assume that the electrodes are half filled , i.e. , the corresponding left and right chemical potentials are positioned at @xmath140 , and the applied voltage @xmath141 symmetrically shifts the on - site energies , @xmath142 .    for the embedded system we take @xmath143 atoms from each electrode as buffers .",
    "this size of the buffers has been proven to give the exact results for the steady - state current calculated within the mean - field approximation and the second order perturbation ( sopt ) theory  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    "we justify this choice of @xmath144 for nonequilibrium configuration interaction ( neci ) calculations .",
    "following  @xcite , we studied the convergency of necc results against increasing the size of buffers .",
    "we found that when increasing @xmath144 the necc current converges to some limit value .",
    "moreover , for @xmath145 the results are affected only marginally by increase of @xmath144 regardless of the particular choices of model parameters .        before considering",
    "obtained results , let us briefly discuss numerical solution of the system of equations   for cluster amplitudes .",
    "the set of nonlinear equations is solved by applying newton s iterative scheme .",
    "it is clear that the main computational cost comes from large buffer zones .",
    "namely , for the cluster correlation superoperator quadratic with respect to @xmath146 ,   @xmath147 the dimension of the system increases as @xmath148 .",
    "however the system is sparse and number of nonzero elements is proportional to @xmath148 . for for @xmath143",
    "the system can be solved on a standard personal computer ( e.g. , 16  gb of ram and intel core i5 quad - core cpu with 3.4  ghz clock speed ) in about one hour . to solve the system we have used sparse solver routines from intel mkl fortran library .    to illustrate the approach ,",
    "we compute the current through the central region as a function of the level energy @xmath76 . in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , each panel displays the current @xmath149 calculated for a particular choice of model parameters .",
    "we compare , for the same sets of model parameters , the calculated necc(1 ) currents with those obtained by the second order perturbation theory  @xcite and with the nonequilibrium configuration interaction method built on the coherent reference state ( a so - called neci@xmath150 approximation )  @xcite .    in the upper panels of figure  [ fig2 ] we consider the case when @xmath151 , that means that the vibrational state in the system is not thermally excited .",
    "in this case the necc(1 ) current reaches a maximum value exactly at @xmath152 .",
    "it is the so - called reorganization energy   of an electronic state associated to the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "therefore , when @xmath153 is close to chemical potentials of the electrodes ( resonant regime ) the necc(1 ) current reaches its maximum value .    from the upper - left panel",
    "we see that for a weak electron - phonon coupling ( @xmath154 ) all three approaches predict the currents which closely follow each other for all values of @xmath76 .",
    "this resemblance vanishes , however , with an increase in the coupling strength ( see the upper - middle panel ) : in the resonant regimes the sopt and neci@xmath150 currents overestimate the necc result and , in addition , the sopt current becomes unphysical negative in the off - resonant regime .",
    "the negative sopt current disappears if we consider the case of larger phonon energy ( see the upper - right panel ) . for this case ,",
    "the necc and neci@xmath150 calculations give the same result , while the maximum value of the sopt current noticeably exceeds the maximum values of the necc(1 ) and neci@xmath150 currents .",
    "the advantages of the necc method become more apparent by considering the case when the central region contains a nonzero number of thermally excited equilibrium vibrational quanta . for @xmath155 ,",
    "the results of such calculations are shown in the lower panels of figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "as obvious from the graphs the necc(1 ) current is symmetric with respect to @xmath156 . for the identical electrodes employed this result is a consequence of a particle - hole symmetry of the whole system . indeed , by applying the particle - hole transformation to all fermionic operators and then performing a shift of the phonon field we get the same system but with an electronic state with energy @xmath157 .",
    "therefore , the current should be symmetric with respect to @xmath156 .",
    "contrary to the necc method , the sopt and neci@xmath150 approaches do not fulfill the symmetry property .",
    "this is most clearly evident in the lower - middle panel of figure  [ fig2 ] , where both the sopt and neci@xmath150 approaches demonstrate the substantially asymmetric behaviour .",
    "it is interesting to note , the behaviour of the neci@xmath150 current becomes more symmetric when we decrease the coupling strength or increase the phonon energy . as a result , for @xmath154 the difference between the necc(1 ) and neci@xmath150 currents is marginally negligible , while for @xmath158 and @xmath159 both the approaches give results close to each other .        in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we compare necc(1 ) and necc(2 ) electron currents .",
    "we also show the current for the noninteracting ( @xmath160 ) electronic level for the comparison in this figure .",
    "one can see from the figure , the inclusion of higher order term @xmath161 ( see eq .  ) into cluster correlation superoperator does not change substantially the results of the necc(1 ) approach . the difference between the necc(1 ) and necc(2 ) currents is negligible for weak coupling ( left panel ) .",
    "moreover , the inclusion of four - fermion component into cluster correlation superoperator leaves the @xmath76 dependence of the current almost unchanged even in the strong coupling regime ( middle and right panels )  the difference between necc(1 ) and necc(2 ) is only a few percent of the total current .",
    "thus , we can say that even the use of excited cluster superoperator @xmath111 , which is quadratic in in fermion creation superoperators ( [ sprime ] ) , captures the most of nonequilibrium correlations in our model .",
    "in this paper , we propose an extension of the coupled cluster method to nonequilibrium correlated many - body quantum systems described by the lindblad master equations .",
    "the method is based on a superoperator representation of the master equation .",
    "it was shown that in liouville - fock space the steady - state density matrix can be defined via the exponential ansatz @xmath162 , where @xmath54 is a reference state and @xmath56 is a cluster correlation superoperator linearly expanded in terms of a complete set of multiconfigurational creation superoperators . a general prescription how to calculate expansion ( cluster )",
    "amplitudes was given .",
    "as an application of the method , quantum transport through a vibrational electronic level was considered . to compute the steady - state current a truncated expansion of the cluster correlation superoperator was used .",
    "it was shown that the method always preserves the continuity equation , no matter how we truncate the cluster correlation superoperator .",
    "it was demonstrated that the necc method provides advantages over the perturbation theory and the nonequilibrium configuration interaction method when the electron - phonon coupling is large or when the system contains thermally excited vibrational quanta .    to conclude we would like to mention some possible further steps .",
    "an obvious application of the necc method is to apply it to the charge transport problem through the system with electron - electron correlations .",
    "another route is to extend the method to a dynamical nonequilibrium case by making the cluster amplitudes time - dependent functions .",
    "all these will be the subject of our future investigations .",
    "here we demonstrate how to define normal modes for the liouvillian @xmath96 , where @xmath163 such that the uncorrelated density matrix @xmath164 and the super - vector @xmath45 would be the right and left vacuum states , respectivelly .",
    "first of all we note that due to eq .   the superoperators @xmath165 and their tilde conjugated partners @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 annihilate @xmath45 when acting from the right .",
    "however , since @xmath45 and @xmath54 are not mutually hermitian conjugate , the respective annihilation superoperators can not be defined by taking the hermitian conjugate  of  ( [ creation1 ] ) .    to define annihilation superoperators associated with the central region",
    "we assume that that does not contain electrons when disconnected from the electrodes , while there are a certain number @xmath104 of thermally excited equilibrium vibrational quanta @xmath169 then we introduce @xmath170 such that @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 as for the buffers , we can apply the equation of motion method and define @xmath174 such that @xmath175 where @xmath176 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath177 .",
