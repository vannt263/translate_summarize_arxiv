    "universal features of collective phenomena can be determined within the framework of statistical mechanics with the interaction potentials approximated by highly simplified generic models . the generic model that allows for a prediction of general features of the collective phenomena in ionic systems as diverse as molten salts , electrolytes , room - temperature ionic liquids , as well as systems containing charged nanoparticles ( including proteins ) , and/or charged colloidal particles , is the primitive model ( pm ) . in the pm ions",
    "are represented by charged hard spheres , and the solvent ( if present ) is taken into account only through the dielectric constant  @xcite . in real systems",
    "the molecular structure of the solvent and multipole moments and polarizability of ions and solvent molecules affect the collective phenomena in the way that depends significantly on the specific properties of the ions and the solvent  @xcite , and is far from being understood . to identify and analyze specific effects in particular cases , however , one should know , in the first place , the phase diagram and structure in the generic case , where such effects are not present .    despite the simplicity of the interaction potential in the pm ,",
    "the dependence of the phase diagrams and the correlation functions on the charge , @xmath3 and the diameter , @xmath4 ratios of the two ionic species , respectively , is a largely unexplored problem . until very recently the theoretical studies concentrated mainly on the restricted primitive model ( rpm)@xcite , where @xmath5 . in the rpm",
    "a gas - liquid separation occurs at low densities , and the bcc ionic crystal occurs at higher densities and sufficiently low temperatures . at still higher densities the fcc crystal with and without substitutional order at low and at high temperatures",
    "respectively is stable  @xcite .    although much studied , the rpm is a quite artificial model , in the sense that no real ionic fluid has anions and cations of _ exactly _ the same size , although the size disparity is rather small in some , such as kcl .",
    "when one assumes full anion - cation symmetry , as in the rpm , there is a remarkable decoupling of the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) integral equations that describe the density - density correlation function and the charge - charge correlation function , respectively .",
    "the two correlation functions are still indirectly coupled through the `` closure relations '' that must be added to the oz equations to yield a closed set of equations , and the different approximations that have come into standard use in solving the primitive - model oz equations the mean spherical approximation , the hypernetted chain approximation , etc. are defined by different closure relations  @xcite .",
    "the total and the direct correlation function in the liquid theory are directly related to the ( connected ) correlation function and the vertex function respectively in the field theory ( ft ) , and similar decoupling of the analogs of the oz equations in the ft approach is found  @xcite .",
    "as soon as there is any degree of asymmetry , however , the density - density and charge - charge correlation functions are directly coupled , as are the oz integral equations for these two functions  @xcite , as well as their analogs in the ft  @xcite .",
    "we shall not go through the details of this case here , and the interested reader will find those details in section 2.2 of ref.@xcite .",
    "there is one aspect of the results there that is worth noting here explicitly , however .",
    "if there is only a very small degree of asymmetry for example , if the effective diameters of the anions and cations are very nearly the same in a 1 - 1 electrolyte , one would expect that the rpm equations would be `` almost '' satisfied in some sense , despite the direct coupling one finds in the asymmetric case .",
    "this turns out to be the case one finds that deviations from the rpm result only appear very close to the critical point for very small asymmetries .",
    "the smaller the deviations , the closer one must be to the critical point ( cp ) to see them .",
    "recent theoretical  @xcite and simulation   @xcite results show that the pm with a small and moderate asymmetry exhibits qualitatively the same critical behavior as the rpm . in the asymmetric case",
    "the cp is shifted to lower temperatures and number densities ( but higher volume fractions )  @xcite .",
    "we expect to make further contact between our ft treatment for asymmetric ionic fluids and the general results of ref.@xcite concerning the critical behavior in future work .",
    "as far as we know , the effect of the size- and charge asymmetry on the gas - solid and liquid - solid transitions attracted much less attention so far .    despite our general insight into the asymmetric case that has come out of the work of ref.@xcite , and intensive studies of highly charged colloids  @xcite , the case of the extreme asymmetry , @xmath6 ,",
    "is not fully understood .",
    "this is because on the theoretical side the effect of approximations and assumptions on the results may be significant . in experiments  @xcite the interactions differ from the pm , and the role of specific interactions and/or of the solvent properties is not known in full detail .",
    "moreover , results may be sensitive to impurities , nonequilibrium effects etc .. last but not least , it is very difficult to obtain reliable simulation results for the phase diagram when @xmath6 . to ensure charge neutrality @xmath1 anions must be present per each cation , and in studies of collective phenomena the number of cations",
    "@xmath7 must be large .",
    "typical experiments correspond to @xmath8 , i.e. to @xmath9 ions in the simulation box .",
    "because of the above reasons , there is no consensus concerning the phase behavior in the pm in the case of the extreme asymmetry , and the results of some experiments  @xcite are considered as controversial  @xcite .",
    "the controversy concerns mainly the occurrence of the gas - liquid separation at room temperature in the case of monovalent counterions .",
    "simulations indicate that at room temperatures the gas - liquid separation for monovalent counterions does not occur , but occurs for divalent counterions  @xcite .",
    "preliminary field - theoretic results  @xcite indicate that when the size and the charge of the cation are several orders of magnitude larger than the size and the charge of the anion , the gas - liquid type phase separation is preempted by a transition between gas and a colloidal crystal for a large range of temperatures , including room temperature  @xcite .",
    "the predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite are limited to the mean field ( mf ) approximation , and the effect of fluctuations on the transition lines remains to be determined along the same lines as in the case of the rpm  @xcite .",
    "the phase behavior for higher volume fractions is also not quite clear .",
    "many studies suggest a transition between the bcc and fcc crystals , and next a gel or glass formation when the volume fraction of colloidal particles increases  @xcite .",
    "additional counterions and coions significantly influence the phase behavior   @xcite .",
    "note that the above phase behavior is quite different than the behavior in the rpm .    the way the global phase diagram evolves when the asymmetry parameters are varied has not been systematically investigated yet .",
    "the values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 have a strong effect on formation of ordered periodic structures of a crystal type .",
    "coulomb interactions support structures in which the positive charges are compensated by the negative charges in regions as small as possible . on the other hand , precise compensation of charges in small regions",
    "may lead to an increase of entropy .",
    "the electrostatic and the entropic contributions to the grand potential both depend on the geometrical constraints .",
    "these constraints are due to a packing of @xmath1 spheres of a diameter @xmath10 and one sphere of a diameter @xmath11 into a charge - neutral aggregate , and a possibility of periodically repeating this aggregate in space .",
    "such an ordered structure is favored compared to the disordered phase when the entropic contribution is sufficiently small compared to the electrostatic energy .",
    "combination of the geometric constrains and the charge - neutrality condition for some values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 may promote ordering , while in other cases may suppress ordering .",
    "the competition between the periodic ordering and the phase separation also depends on @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "thus , rich and complex phase behavior in the parameter space @xmath12 may be expected , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the volume fraction of ions and temperature in the standard reduced ( dimensionless ) units  @xcite , defined in the next section .",
    "depending on the values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , phase equilibria on the @xmath15 phase diagram may include some ( or all ) of the following transitions : gas - crystal , gas - liquid , liquid - crystal , crystal - glass , crystal - gel or transition between different crystalline phases .",
    "for different @xmath1 and @xmath0 the above phase equilibria may occur in quite different parts of the @xmath15 phase diagram .",
    "some insight into the dependence of the phase behavior on @xmath1 and @xmath0 can be gained from studies of pretransitional effects in the disordered phase .",
    "such effects may be divided into two categories : effects associated with the gas - liquid separation and effects associated with the crystallization .",
    "theoretical studies  @xcite emphasize the role of cluster formation for the gas - liquid separation in ionic systems .",
    "recent monte carlo ( mc )  @xcite , molecular dynamics ( md )  @xcite and brownian dynamics ( bd )  @xcite simulation studies provide interesting information on clustering in the size- and charge asymmetric pm . in refs.@xcite",
    "the simulations were performed at room temperature for several values of the volume fraction of the larger ions , for several sizes of both ionic species ( size ratio  5 - 10 ) , and for several values of the charge on the larger ion (  10 - 20 elementary charges ) .",
    "the cluster formation was studied for mono- di- and trivalent counterions for fixed values of the remaining parameters . in equilibrium",
    "the instantaneous structures are much more uniform in the case of monovalent counterions than in the other cases , where living clusters containing two or more large ions are formed  @xcite . for trivalent counterions a substantial fraction of the clusters was found to be neutral .",
    "attractions between the neutral clusters are similar to the attractions between molecules , and may lead to the phase separation .",
    "the dependence on valency of counterions for a fixed charge on the larger ion and for fixed temperature is equivalent to a dependence on @xmath1 and @xmath14 .",
    "the question of the region in the parameter space @xmath12 corresponding to a formation of neutral clusters remains open .",
    "pretransitional effects associated with weak long - range ordering are a subject of the present study . by analogy with the _ short - range ordering of the instantaneous states _ described above",
    ", we expect that such effects include _ long - range ordering of the instantaneous states_. in the long - range ordered instantaneous states a local deviation from the uniform distribution of ions is periodically repeated in space .    in this work we present an overview of the collective phenomena in the pm for the whole range of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "our ft analysis allows us to identify the dominant deviations from the uniform distribution of ions .",
    "we find structural lines that separate the stability region of the disordered phase on the @xmath15 phase diagram in the high - temperature part where the homogeneous instantaneous states are more probable than periodic states with small amplitude , and in the low-@xmath14 part , where the majority of the instantaneous states exhibit weak long - range order . at the structural line the amplitude of the periodic deviation from the uniform distribution of ions in the most probable instantaneous states increases continuously from zero .",
    "we stress that the structural line is neither a phase transition in the thermodynamic sense , nor a true spinodal .",
    "determination of the probability of the periodic instantaneous states with large amplitudes , as well as determination of the phase transitions requires further studies , for which our analysis should serve as a starting point .    in sec.ii",
    "we describe the field theory for the pm .",
    "we introduce the concept of the structural line and show that this line coincides with the mf approximation for the spinodal line . in sec.iii",
    "general expressions for the eigenmodes and boundary of stability of the uniform phase in mf ( structural lines ) are given .",
    "the nature of the eigenmodes is discussed , and the dominant instantaneous states are identified in the same section .",
    "sec.iv is devoted to the case of equal sizes .",
    "mf - spinodal ( structural ) lines associated with the gas - liquid separation are described in detail in sec.v , and in sec.vi the structural lines associated with periodic ordering are discussed .",
    "explicit results for representative values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 are also presented in these two sections .",
    "a short summary is given in sec.vii .",
    "we consider a mixture of positively charged ions of a charge @xmath16 and diameter @xmath17 , and negatively charged ions of a charge @xmath18 and diameter @xmath10 in a structureless , incompressible solvent . in the pm the interaction potential of a pair @xmath19 , where the greek indices denote @xmath20 or @xmath21 , is infinite for distances smaller than @xmath22 , i.e. we assume hard - core repulsions .",
