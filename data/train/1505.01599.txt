    "singular spectrum analysis ( ssa ) is a nonparametric and adaptive decomposition of a time series . in the ssa ,",
    "the original time series is decomposed into arbitrary number of additive components and they are interpreted as the slowly varying trend , oscillatory and noise components , respectively [ 2,3 ] . in the conventional approach , the original time series @xmath0 is embedded into the trajectory matrix @xmath1 through the lagged vectors of length @xmath2 by forming @xmath3 lagged vectors .",
    "then the singular value decomposition of the trajectory matrix @xmath1 is carried out as @xmath4 with @xmath5 are the rank 1 matrices .",
    "after grouping the matrices @xmath5 , the time series is reconstructed by projecting the matrices @xmath5 into hankel form through the anti - diagonal averaging .",
    "recently , it has been shown that these ssa procedure can equivalently be interpreted as the two - step ( forward and the reverse ) filtering of a time series [ 6,8 ] .",
    "the eigenvector @xmath6 of the matrix @xmath7 can be interpreted as the convolution coefficients of the non - causal fir filter .",
    "let us denote the discrete fourier transform of the eigenvector @xmath8 for @xmath7 as @xmath9 . in fourier space",
    ", the first ( second ) step filtering can be expressed as the multiplication of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) to the original sequences .",
    "then the two - step filtering can be expressed as the multiplication of the zero - phase filters @xmath12 [ 7 ] .",
    "the normalization and the perfect - reconstruction properties can be expresses as @xmath13 and @xmath14 and these are the consequences of the normalization and the completeness properties of the eigenvectors @xmath8 for @xmath7 [ 8 ] .",
    "though the filtering interpretation of the ssa algorithm is equivalent to the conventional treatment , it has several advantages . in the conventional approach , the singular value decomposition of the trajectory matrix and the reconstruction procedure through the hankel projection seems to be quite different procedures and this makes it difficult to extend ssa to higher dimension . with the filtering interpretation , these procedures can be seen as the forward and the reverse two - step point - symmetric convolution with respect to the reference points .",
    "this largely simplify the algorithms and enables us to extend the ssa to the decomposition of multidimensional data with arbitrary dimension [ 9 ] .",
    "also , we can study the properties of the filters separately and it helps us for the detailed study of the spectral meaning of the decomposition .",
    "there have been several works in which the ssa algorithm has been applied to 2d image data [ 4,12 ] or three dimensional polygonal data [ 10,11 ] . in this paper , we focus on the ssa decomposition of the 2d image data . under the periodic boundary condition for the image data ,",
    "the matrix @xmath7 becomes to be the bisymmetric type and it leads to either the symmetric or the antisymmetric eigenvectors .",
    "a single step filtering generated with these eigenvectors can be interpreted as the differential operation to the images and the symmetric ( antisymmetric ) eigenvalues lead to the derivative filters of the even- ( odd- ) order . in the image processing ,",
    "various differential filters are designed to detect and enhance the edge lines in the images . in the ssa decomposition of the 2d image data ,",
    "these differential filters are adaptively and optimally generated .",
    "we have examined these points in detail , focusing our attention to the characteristics of the filters in the ssa .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the possibility of the denoising with the ssa decomposition .    in sec .",
    "2 , we give a brief summary of the ssa algorithm in 2d image decomposition , emphasizing the role of filters . in sec .",
    "3 , we give an example of the ssa decomposition of the image data , and the symmetry of the eigenvector leads to the symmetry properties of the filters and these are reflected as the filter characteristics for the image data .",
    "an implication of these properties to the image denoising is briefly discussed . in sec .",
    "4 , we summarize the results of this paper .",
    "let us consider the 2d image data given by the matrix @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",

    "the ssa algorithm employs the eigenvectors of the eigenvalue equation for @xmath7 @xmath42 and this criterion means that the quantities @xmath43 are maximized preserving the orthonormality of the vector @xmath44 [ 9 ] . in this sense , the ssa algorithm is the principal component analysis in the space of the lagged vectors . in the next subsection ,",
    "we discuss the symmetry properties of the eigenvectors @xmath8 and it s implication to the 2d image decomposition .",
    "we assign the vector components for the rectangular - shaped moving window with @xmath45 in a natural order as in eq .",
    "( [ movingwindow ] ) .",
    "we assume the periodic boundary condition for the image data .",
    "then the lag - covariance matrix @xmath46 becomes to be the bisymmetric matrix , satisfying the relation @xmath47 this can be seen as follows .",
    "the moving window in eq.([movingwindow ] ) slides from left to right and up to bottom sweeping the whole image data @xmath33 .",
    "the component @xmath48 of the matrix @xmath49 is calculated by picking and summing up the matrix elements of @xmath33 , corresponding to the position @xmath50 and @xmath25 in the window , and this is the same for @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the location of the components @xmath50 and @xmath52 is just point symmetric about the center of the window .",
    "this also is the same for the relation between @xmath25 and @xmath53 .",

    "so far , much efforts have been devoted to the image restoration . various linear or non - linear filtering operations",
