    "light scalar fields populate theories of both cosmology and physics beyond the standard model . in generic models ,",
    "these fields can couple to matter and hence potentially mediate a new ( or ` fifth ' ) force between bodies .",
    "however , no such new force has been detected @xcite .",
    "any force associated with such light scalar fields must therefore be considerably weaker than gravity over the scales , and under the conditions , that have been experimentally probed .",
    "the fields must either interact with matter far more weakly than gravity does , or be sufficiently massive so as to have remained hidden thus far .",
    "there is however an assumption when deriving the above conclusions : the mass , @xmath0 , of the scalar field is taken to be a constant .",
    "it has recently been shown that the most stringent experimental limits on the properties of light scalar fields can be exponentially relaxed if the scalar field theory in question possesses a _ chameleon mechanism _ @xcite .",
    "the chameleon mechanism provides a way to suppress the forces mediated by these scalar fields via non - linear field self - interactions .",
    "a direct result of these self - interactions is that the mass of the field is no longer fixed but depends on , amongst other things , the ambient density of matter .",
    "the properties of these scalar fields therefore change depending on the environment ; it is for this reason that such fields have been dubbed _ chameleon fields _ .. chameleon fields could potentially also be responsible for the observed late - time acceleration of the universe @xcite . in the longer term , it has been shown that future experimental measurements of the casimir force will be able to detect or rule out many , if not all , of the most interesting chameleon field models for dark energy @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown that some strongly - coupled ( i.e. , compared to gravity ) chameleon fields would alter light propagation through the vacuum in the presence of a magnetic field in a polarization - dependent manner @xcite ; the resultant birefringence and dichroism could be detected in laboratory searches such as the polarization experiments pvlas @xcite , q&a @xcite , and bmv @xcite that are sensitive to new hypothetical particles with a light mass and a weak coupling to photons .",
    "popular candidates for these searches are the axion @xcite , or more generally an axion - like particle ( alp ) , minicharged particles ( mcps ) @xcite , or paraphotons @xcite .",
    "these particle candidates may be viewed as low - energy effective degrees of freedom of more involved microscopic theories . in this sense",
    ", chameleons could be classified as alps as far as optical experiments are concerned , but give rise to specific optical signatures to be discussed in detail in this work .",
    "in fact , a variety of further experiments such as alps @xcite , lipps @xcite , osqar @xcite , and gammev @xcite have been proposed and are currently built up or are even already taking data . they look for anomalous optical signatures from light propagation in a modified quantum vacuum .",
    "this rapidly evolving field has been triggered by the fact that optical experiments provide a rather unique laboratory tool , because photons can be manipulated and detected with a great precision . since laboratory set - ups aim at both production and detection of new particles under fully controlled experimental conditions , they are complementary to astrophysical considerations such as those based on stellar energy loss .",
    "the latter can indeed give rather strong bounds , for instance , on axion models @xcite .",
    "but for models with particle candidates which exhibit very different properties in the stellar plasma as compared with the laboratory environment , purely laboratory - based experiments are indispensable @xcite .",
    "the chameleon is exactly of this type , therefore being an ideal particle candidate for high - precision laboratory - based searches .",
    "this work is devoted to an investigation of possible optical signatures which can specifically be attributed to chameleon fields , thereby representing a smoking gun for this particle candidate .",
    "the standard optical signatures in polarization experiments are induced ellipticity and rotation for a propagating laser beam interacting with a strong magnetic field @xcite ; these exist for a chameleon @xcite , but occur similarly for alps @xcite , mcps @xcite or models involving also paraphotons @xcite . in the case of a positive signal , the various scenarios can be distinguished from each other by analyzing the signal dependence on the experimental parameters such as magnetic field strength , laser frequency , length of the interaction region @xcite .",
    "alp and paraphoton models can specifically be tested by light - shining - through - walls experiments @xcite ; mcps can leave a decisive trace in mcp production experiments in the form of a dark current @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we propose an _ afterglow _ phenomenon as a unique chameleon trace in an optical experiment .",
    "the existence of this afterglow is directly linked with the environment dependence of the chameleon mass parameter . in particular",
    ", the mass dependence on the ambient matter density causes the trapping of chameleons inside the vacuum chamber where they have been produced , e.g. , by a laser pulse interacting with a strong magnetic field . as detailed below",
    ", the trapping can be so efficient that the re - conversion of chameleons into photons in a magnetic field causes an afterglow over macroscopic time scales .",
    "most importantly , our afterglow estimates clearly indicate that the new - physics parameter range accessible to current technology is substantial and can become comparable to scales familiar from astrophysical considerations .",
    "afterglow searches therefore represent a tool to probe physics halfway up to the planck scale .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : chammodel ] , we review aspects of the chameleon model which are relevant to the optical phenomena discussed in this work . in sect .  [",
    "sec : chamjar ] , we solve the equations of motion for the coupled photon - chameleon system , paying particular attention to the boundary conditions which give rise to the afterglow phenomenon . signatures of the afterglow are exemplified in sect .  [",
    "sec : sigaglow ] .",
    "the chameleonic afterglow is compared with other background sources and systematic effects in sect .",
    "[ sec : back ] .",
    "our conclusions are given in sect .",
    "[ sec : con ] . in the appendix",
    ", we discuss another option for afterglow detection based on chameleon resonances in the vacuum chamber .",
    "as was mentioned above , chameleon theories are essentially scalar field theories with a self - interaction potential and a coupling to matter ; they are specified by the action @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the chameleon field with a self - interaction potential @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 denotes the matter action and @xmath5 are the matter fields , and we have also explicitly listed the coupling to photons .",
    "the strength of the interaction between @xmath2 and the matter fields is determined by the one or more mass scales @xmath6 . in general",
    ", we expect different particle species to couple with different strengths to the chameleon field , i.e. , a different @xmath6 for each @xmath5 .",
    "such a differential coupling would lead to violations of the weak equivalence principle ( wep hereafter ) .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath3 can be chosen so that any violations of wep are too small to have been detected thus far @xcite . even though the @xmath6 are generally different for different species , if @xmath7 , we generally expect @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being some mass scale associated with the theory .",
    "provided this is the case , the differential nature of the coupling will have very little effect on our predictions for the experiments considered here . in this paper , we therefore simplify the analysis by assuming a universal coupling @xmath10 .",
    "note that if the matter fields are non - relativistic .",
    "the scalar field , @xmath2 , obeys : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the background density of matter .",
    "the coupling to matter implies that particle masses in the einstein frame depend on the value of @xmath2 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the bare mass .",
    "we parametrize the strength of the chameleon to matter coupling by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 . on microscopic scales",
    "( and over sufficiently short distances ) , the chameleon force between two particles is then @xmath18 times the strength of their mutual gravitational attraction .",
    "if the mass , @xmath19 , of @xmath2 is a constant then one must either require that @xmath20 or @xmath21 for such a theory not to have been already ruled out by experimental tests of gravity @xcite .",
    "if , however , the mass of the scalar field grows with the background density of matter , then a much wider range of scenarios have been shown to be possible @xcite . in high - density regions , @xmath22",
    "can then be large enough so as to satisfy the constraints coming from tests of gravity . at the same time",
    ", the mass of the field can be small enough in low density regions to produce detectable and potentially important alterations to standard physical laws . assuming @xmath23 as it is above , a scalar field theory possesses a chameleon mechanism if , for some range of @xmath2 , the self - interaction potential , @xmath3 , has the following properties : @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the evolution of the chameleon field in the presence of ambient matter with density @xmath26 is then determined by the effective potential : @xmath27 as a result , even though @xmath28 might have a runaway form , the conditions on @xmath3 ensure that the effective potential has a minimum at @xmath29 where @xmath30    whether or not the chameleon mechanism is both active and strong enough to evade current experimental constraints depends partially on the details of the theory , i.e. @xmath3 and @xmath9 , and partially on the initial conditions ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion ) . for exponential matter couplings and a potential of the form",
    "@xmath31 the chameleon mechanism can in principle hide the field such that there is no conflict with current laboratory experiments , solar system or cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "importantly , for a large range of values of @xmath32 , the chameleon mechanism is strong enough in such theories to allow even strongly coupled theories with @xmath33 to have remained undetected @xcite .",
    "the first term in @xmath3 corresponds to an effective cosmological constant whilst the second term is a ratra - peebles inverse power - law potential @xcite .",
    "if one assumes that @xmath2 is additionally responsible for late - time acceleration of the universe then one must require @xmath34 .    throughout the rest of this paper",
    ", it is our aim to remain as general as possible and assume as little about the precise form of @xmath3 as is necessary .",
    "however , when we come to more detailed discussions and make specific numerical predictions , it will be necessary to choose a particular form for @xmath3 . in these situations , we assume that @xmath3 has the following form : @xmath35 we do this not because this power - law form of @xmath28 is in any way preferred or to be expected , but merely as it has been the most widely studied in the literature and because is the simplest with which to perform analytical calculations .",
    "the power - law form is also useful as an example as it displays , for different values of the @xmath36 , many of the features that we expect to see in more general chameleon theories .",
    "we also note how the predictions of a theory with @xmath37 differ from those of a theory with a true power - law potential . with",
    "this choice of potential , the constant term in @xmath3 is responsible for the late time acceleration of the universe .",
    "for a chameleon - like scalar field , the classical field equations following from eq .",
    "are @xmath38 where we have used the lorenz - gauge condition .",
    "we take @xmath39 as the background magnetic field , and @xmath40 as the propagating photon , moving in the positive @xmath41 direction ( `` to the right '' ) .",
    "we perform a fourier transform with respect to time , @xmath42 where we have dropped the label @xmath43 , since the photon component @xmath44 parallel to the magnetic field anyway does not interact with the chameleon at all .",
    "the notation @xmath45 is introduced here for later convenience . defining @xmath46 and @xmath47 as the fourier transforms w.r.t .",
    "@xmath41 of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we arrive at @xmath50 solutions exist if @xmath51 the roots of which define the dispersion relations , @xmath52 where @xmath53 defining @xmath54 , the general solutions @xmath55 and @xmath56 for the equations of motion read : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the amplitude of the wave traveling to the left ( right )",
    ". so far , the above equations are very similar to those of a laser interaction with a scalar alp ( or dilaton - like particle ) in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the important difference between a scalar alp and a chameleon is due to the boundary conditions at the ends of the optical vacuum chamber : whereas an alp is considered to be weakly interacting , the chameleon is reflected at the chamber ends and thus `` trapped '' in the vacuum chamber .",
    "we begin by considering the simplest set - up for an analytic study , wherein the two ends of the vacuum chamber ( `` jar '' ) are located right at edge of the magnetic interaction region , i.e. , @xmath59 inside the jar and @xmath60 outside .",
    "we also confine ourselves to an experiment where the photon field is not stored in an optical cavity as for alp searches , but simply enters , passes through and leaves the interaction region .",
    "the chameleon field is however trapped between two optical windows of the vacuum chamber .",
    "the chameleon field is taken to reflect perfectly off the walls of the jar which are located at @xmath61 and @xmath62 , whereas the photons only enter the jar at @xmath62 and pass straight through .",
    "the reflection of the chameleon field implies that @xmath63 at @xmath62 and @xmath61 .",
    "this gives @xmath64 for the photon boundary conditions , it is useful to introduce the operators @xmath65 and @xmath66 which project onto right- and left - moving photon components in vacuum .",
    "the condition that no photons enter the jar on the right side at @xmath61 , @xmath67 , gives : @xmath68 let as assume that the photon field entering the jar at @xmath62 has the form @xmath69 with the vacuum dispersion relation @xmath70 .",
    "then , the photon boundary condition at @xmath62 is given by @xmath71 , yielding @xmath72 equations - and determine the photon amplitudes @xmath73 completely , and a full solution is straightforward . the physical signature of the chameleon field is encoded in the outgoing photon that leaves the jar at @xmath61 and which we parametrize as @xmath74 again with the vacuum dispersion @xmath70 .",
    "the form of the wave packet @xmath75 as a function of the amplitudes @xmath76 is determined by the matching condition @xmath77 , implying @xmath78 since we expect @xmath9 to be a scale beyond the particle - physics standard model , and @xmath79(1  mev ) , the dimensionless combination @xmath80 can be considered as a very small parameter for all presently conceivable laboratory field strengths . for typical laboratory laser frequencies",
    "@xmath81 , the whole right - hand side of eq .",
    "is small , implying that @xmath82 is a small expansion parameter for the present problem .",
    "we also assume that the laser frequency is larger than the vacuum chameleon mass , @xmath83 , but the combination @xmath84 can still be a sizable number owing to the length of the jar . in these limits , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the outgoing wave packet reduces to @xmath87.\\ ] ] let us study the quotient @xmath88 we assume that the photon wave packet that is sent into the jar @xmath89 is strongly peaked about @xmath90 .",

    "this requires @xmath110 to be no greater than a few nanoseconds .",
    "the gammev experiment @xcite uses @xmath111 wide pulses which avoids interference effects . on the other hand",
    ", it may be possible to exploit the interference effects for increasing the sensitivity or a determination of the chameleon mass ; see the appendix .",

    "let us consider the simple case where the pulse length @xmath155 , such that chameleon and photon afterglow propagation inside the cavity happens in well separated bunches . for a @xmath156 pulse",

    ", there will be no interference between the chameleonic afterglow and the initial pulse .",
    "we assume that for @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 before and after this time period . henceforth , we set @xmath161 .",

    "however , to actually achieve such a bound one would have to run the experiment for at least a time of @xmath140 which for @xmath197gev is about @xmath198yrs .",

    "we concluded that afterglow experiments are well suited for exploring unknown regions in the parameter space of chameleon models .",
    "as a side remark and a check of the calculation , we note that the total number of photons contained in the full afterglow can be obtained from eq .   by extending the upper bound of the sum to infinity ; this yields @xmath206 which is one half of the total number of photons that would have been initially converted into chameleon particles ; the other half creates an afterglow on the other ( left ) side of the vacuum chamber .      as a further example , let us consider a more optimized experimental set - up that nevertheless involves only parameters which are achievable by current standard means or systems available in the near future . our optimized experimental set - up consists of an @xmath207 m long magnetic field of strength @xmath208 t which corresponds exactly to that of the osqar experiment at cern @xcite .",

    "it is more reasonable then to ask what lower - bound one could place on @xmath9 if no photons are detected from the afterglow of a single pulse after a time @xmath199 has passed .",
    "we find : @xmath226 we see that after one minute of measurements one could bound @xmath227 , and if measurements could be conducted constantly over a 24 hour period then this could be extended to @xmath228 .",
    "it is interesting to confront these potential afterglow laboratory bounds with typical sensitivity scales obtained from astrophysical arguments : the non - observation of solar axion - like particles by the cast experiment imposes a bound of @xmath229gev for @xmath230ev @xcite ; slightly less stringent bounds follow from energy - loss arguments for hb stars @xcite .",
    "the similar order of magnitude demonstrates that laboratory measurements of afterglow phenomena can probe scales of new physics that have so far been explored only with astrophysical observations . of course",
    ", we need to stress that these numbers should not literally be compared to each other , since they apply to different theoretical settings ; in particular , the astrophysical constraints do not apply to chameleonic alps @xcite , whereas the non - observation of an afterglow would not constrain axion models .      as a final example , we consider the recent light - shining - through - a - wall experiment performed by the bmv collaboration @xcite , where a laser with frequency @xmath231 , @xmath232  ns and @xmath233  kj were used .",

    "it must be stressed though that the sensitivity of alp experiments to @xmath0 is strongly peaked about values for which @xmath367 , and so it is not the most ideal probe of @xmath3 ; alp experiments are best suited to measuring or placing lower - bounds on @xmath9 .",
    "casimir force measurements has recently be shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to provide a potentially much more direct probe of @xmath3 but conversely say little about the chameleon to matter coupling , @xmath9 .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the possibility of using an _ afterglow _ phenomenon as a unique chameleon trace in optical experiments . the existence of this afterglow is directly linked with the environment dependence of the chameleon mass parameter .",
    "the latter causes the trapping of chameleons inside the vacuum chamber where they have been produced , e.g. , by a laser pulse interacting with a strong magnetic field .",
    "the afterglow itself is linearly polarized perpendicularly to the magnetic field .",
    "we find that the trapping can be so efficient that the re - conversion of chameleons into photons in a magnetic field causes an afterglow over macroscopic time scales .",
    "for instance , for values of the inverse chameleon - photon coupling @xmath9 slightly above the current detection limit @xmath368gev @xcite and magnetic fields of a few tesla and few meters long , the half - life of the afterglow is on the order of minutes .",
    "current experiments such as alps , bmv , gammev and osqar can improve the current limit on @xmath9 by a few orders of magnitude . with present - day technology ,",
    "even a parameter range of chameleon - photon couplings appears accessible which is comparable in magnitude , e.g. , to bounds on the axion - photon coupling derived from astrophysical considerations , i.e. , @xmath369gev .    in the present work",
    ", we mainly considered the afterglow from an initial short laser pulse , the associated length of which fits into the optical path length within the vacuum chamber . from a technical viewpoint , this choice avoids unwanted interference effects , but it also has an experimental advantage : the resulting afterglow photons all arrive in pulses of the same duration as the initial pulse and are separated by a known time ( i.e. , @xmath370 )",
    ". this can be useful in extracting the signal from any background noise which should not be correlated in this way .",
    "also the polarization dependence of the afterglow can be used to distinguish a possible signal from noise .    as discussed in the appendix ,",
    "also long laser pulses or continuous laser light could be used in an experiment , if the resulting interference can be controlled to some extent such that a chameleon - photon resonance exists at least in some part of the apparatus .",
    "this resonance phenomenon is particularly sensitive to smaller chameleon masses .",
    "unfortunately , a full control of the chameleon resonance may experimentally be very difficult ; but if it were possible , the gain in afterglow photons , and subsequently in sensitivity to a chameleonic sector , could be very significant",
    ".    we would like to stress again that the afterglow phenomenon in the experiments considered here is a smoking gun for a chameleonic particle . from the viewpoint of optical experiments ,",
    "a number of further mechanisms have been proposed that could induce optical signatures in laboratory experiments , but still evade astrophysical constraints @xcite .",
    "distinguishing between the various scenarios in the case of a positive signal for , say , ellipticity and dichroism , may not always be possible with the current laboratory set - ups .",
    "but the observation of an afterglow would strongly point to a chameleon mechanism .    in this sense",
    ", it appears worthwhile to reconsider other concepts on using optical signatures to deduce information about the underlying particle - physics content , e.g. , using strong laser fields @xcite or astronomical observations @xcite , in the light of a chameleon field .    finally , it is interesting to notice that it could , in principle , be possible to measure the varying chameleon mass @xmath0 by varying the vacuum pressure in the experiment and thereby extract information about the scalar potential @xmath3 .",
    "the reconstruction of @xmath3 from this afterglow experiment assumes however that the value of @xmath9 that one detects from afterglow experiments ( i.e , the photon - chameleon coupling ) is the same as the matter - chameleon coupling .",
    "this , of course , need not be the case ; although we might expect them to be of the same magnitude .",
    "by contrast , the reconstruction of @xmath3 from the casimir force tests @xcite does not run into this problem , since these experiments would effectively measure @xmath3 directly and provide only weak constraints on @xmath9 .",
    "if chameleon fields were to be detected , one could , by comparing the reconstructions of @xmath3 from afterglow and casimir experiments , actually measure not only the chameleon - photon coupling but also the chameleon - matter coupling .    in resume ,",
    "our afterglow estimates clearly indicate that the new - physics parameter range accessible even with current technology is substantial .",

    "in this appendix , we discuss the possible use of interference effects for the afterglow phenomenon .",
    "whereas the short - pulse experiments considered in the main text provide for a clean signal , the occurrence of interference depends more strongly on the details and the precision of the experiment .",
    "let us consider a long pulse of duration @xmath371 with frequency @xmath81 and a gauian envelope , @xmath372 in this case , the afterglow amplitude in eq .   or eq .   for a given time @xmath163 at position @xmath41 ( say , at a time @xmath373 after the initial pulse has passed the detector at @xmath374 ) receives contributions from many terms in the @xmath36 sum ; typically , the gauian profile picks up a wide range of large @xmath36 values .",
    "extending the summation range of @xmath36 from @xmath375 to @xmath376 ( instead of @xmath377 to @xmath376 ) introduces only an exponentially small error owing to the gauian envelope , but allows to perform a poisson resummation of the @xmath36 sum ; for instance , the term in the second line of eq .   yields ( @xmath378 ) @xmath379 ^ 2 } , \\label{a2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath380 , and we have dropped terms of order @xmath381 and @xmath382 .",
    "the gauian factor in the last term causes a strong exponential suppression , since @xmath371 and @xmath383 by assumption , and typically @xmath384 .",
    "therefore , this factor essentially picks out one term in the @xmath0 sum that comes closest to the resonance condition @xmath385 let us denote the integer that is closest to this resonance condition with @xmath386 .",
    "then the afterglow amplitude reads @xmath387 e^{-\\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{t^2}{4(l+d)^2 f_+^2 } \\left (      2\\omega ( l+d)f_- -2\\pi m_{\\text{res } } \\right)^2 } \\ , e^{i\\varphi(t , z ) } , \\label{a5}\\ ] ] where @xmath388 summarizes all phases of the amplitude . whether or not the resonance condition can be met is a delicate experimental issue .",
    "the above formula suggests that the experimental parameters require an extraordinary fine - tuning , since the width of the resonance is extremely small .",
    "however , in a real experiment , systematic uncertainties may invalidate the idealized scenario from the very beginning ; for instance , the laser beam has a finite cross section , and the length of the vacuum chamber @xmath282 may vary across this cross section a little bit .",
    "variations on the order of the laser wave length lead to uncertainties of order 1 on the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    "therefore , the resonance condition might be satisfied for some part of the beam only .    for a simplified estimate ,",
    "let us assume that the beam cross section is a circular disc .",
    "the center of the disc is assumed to satisfy the resonance condition exactly , but the length @xmath282 varies linearly from the center to the edge of the disc by a bit less than half a laser wavelength @xmath389 .",
    "averaging over the gauian resonance factor in eq",
    ".   then corresponds to integrating radially over the resonance peak .",
    "this procedure leads to the replacement @xmath390 ( more resonance points in the beam cross section would give a sum of similar terms on the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    ") in this case , we can read off the probability amplitude for a photon in the gauian pulse to reappear in the afterglow at time @xmath391 averaged over the resonance , @xmath392 \\nonumber\\\\    & \\simeq & \\frac{4}{\\pi^2 } \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2 } }     \\frac{b^2 \\omega^2}{m^2 m^4 }   \\frac{(l+d)}{t } \\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac {     m^2}{\\omega^2}}{(1- \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac {     m^2}{\\omega^2})^2 } ,    \\label{pres}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have approximated the @xmath393 by its phase average @xmath394 , since the phase is large and may also vary spatially or over the measurement period .",
    "let us compare the resulting probability for a long pulse @xmath395s with that of a short - pulse set - up for @xmath337 t , @xmath396 m , @xmath397 nm ) in the region of small masses @xmath398mev , @xmath399 ^ 2 \\simeq \\frac{b^4 l^4}{16 m^4 } \\simeq 3.1\\times    10^{-21 } \\left(\\frac{10 ^ 6 \\text{gev}}{m}\\right)^4 , \\nonumber\\\\    \\mathcal{p}_{\\text{average}}^2 & = & \\left[\\frac{4}{\\pi^2}\\sqrt {    \\frac{\\pi}{2 } }   \\frac{b^2 \\omega^2}{m^2   m^4 }   \\frac{(l+d)}{t } \\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac {     m^2}{\\omega^2}}{(1- \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac {     m^2}{\\omega^2})^2 }   \\right]^2 \\simeq 2.8\\times 10^{-33 }   \\left(\\frac{10 ^ 6 \\text{gev}}{m}\\right)^4    \\left(\\frac{0.1 \\text{mev}}{m}\\right)^8 . \\label{a8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here it is important to stress that the calculation has been performed in the limit @xmath400 , corresponding to @xmath401 in other words , the validity range of eqs .   and does not extend to arbitrarily small masses .",
    "still , for small chameleon masses @xmath0 and larger values of @xmath9 ( such that eq",
    ".   holds ) , the averaged resonance probability can exceed that of the short - pulse case in the present example .    using , for instance",
    ", a 10s long pulse from a 100watt laser , the number of photons in the afterglow will be @xmath402 where @xmath250 denotes the measurement time of the afterglow .",
    "we conclude that such an experiment can become sensitive to the coupling scales of order @xmath369gev for chameleon masses in the sub @xmath215ev range .",
    "we stress again that the precise sensitivity limits strongly depend on the experimental details and the feasibility to exploit a chameleon resonance in the vacuum cavity .",
    "if such a resonance can be created in an experiment the interference measurement can provide for a handle on a measurement of the chameleon mass , since the dependence on the latter is rather strong .    if a fully controlled resonance could be built up in an experiment , the suppression factor on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "arising from averaging would be replaced by 1 ; this would correspond to an enhancement factor of @xmath403 for the probability amplitude in the example given above . from an experimental viewpoint , controlling the resonance a priori seems , of course , rather difficult . from the non - observation of an afterglow in a long - pulse experiment",
    ", it would be difficult to conclude whether this points to rather strong bounds on @xmath9 or to the fact that the resonance condition is not sufficiently met .",
    "we therefore recommend short - pulse experiments as a much cleaner and well controllable set - up .      for a review of experimental tests of the equivalence principle and general relativity ,",

    "<S> we propose an _ afterglow _ phenomenon as a unique trace of chameleon fields in optical experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum interaction of a laser pulse with a magnetic field can lead to a production and subsequent trapping of chameleons in the vacuum chamber , owing to their mass dependence on the ambient matter density . </S>",
    "<S> magnetically induced re - conversion of the trapped chameleons into photons creates an afterglow over macroscopic timescales that can conveniently be searched for by current optical experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the chameleon parameter range accessible to available laboratory technology is comparable to scales familiar from astrophysical stellar energy loss arguments . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze quantitatively the afterglow properties for various experimental scenarios and discuss the role of potential background and systematic effects . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that afterglow searches represent an ideal tool to aim at the production and detection of cosmologically relevant scalar fields in the laboratory . </S>"
