    "gravitational lensing by spiral galaxies results in multiple images with sub - arcsecond separation .",
    "a spiral galaxy at a cosmological distance would lens a background qso if the line - of - sight to the qso passed within a few kpc from the disk center . under these circumstances ,",
    "the neutral hydrogen in the disk would inevitably leave a strong ly@xmath4 absorption signature on the quasar spectrum .",
    "a significant hi column density was indeed inferred for the spiral galaxy lens b0218 + 357 which has an einstein ring radius @xmath5 ( carrilli et al . 1993 ) .",
    "strong absorption is expected to result even at large impact parameters from the centers of galactic disks ( @xmath6 ) , where the effect of lensing is weak .",
    "in fact , damped absorption systems with neutral hydrogen column densities @xmath7 are identified routinely in the spectra of high redshift qsos , with an abundance consistent with that expected for the progenitors of present - day disk galaxies ( wolfe 1995 ) .",
    "the association between damped absorbers and the progenitors of present - day disk galaxies is supported by several observational facts .",
    "first , the abundance of heavy elements at low ionization stages in the absorbers and the velocity field traced by them is consistent with values expected for disk galaxies ( turnshek et al .",
    "1989 ; wolfe et al . 1993 ; lu et al . 1993 ; pettini et al . 1994",
    "; lu & wolfe 1994 ) .",
    "recent keck hires observations by wolfe ( 1995 ; see also lanzetta & bowen 1992 ) indicate that the weak low - ionization metal absorption lines in these systems often show the highest column - density component at either the red or the blue edge of the velocity profile .",
    "such an asymmetry is characteristic of absorption by a rotating gaseous disk ( wolfe 1995 ) .",
    "second , observations of redshifted 21-cm absorption and emission from damped absorbers indicate disk - like structures of galactic dimensions ( briggs et al . 1989 ; wolfe et al . 1992 ) , and faraday - rotation observations are consistent with the existence of micro - gauss magnetic fields in these systems ( wolfe , lanzetta , & oren 1992 ; welter , perry , & kronberg 1984 ; perry , watson , & kronberg 1993 ) .",
    "finally , the association of the damped absorbers with star - forming galaxies is directly confirmed by direct imaging ( steidel et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 ) in most of the cases .",
    "however , whereas some systems are clearly spirals , others show irregular morphologies ( le brun et al .",
    "1996 ) . for simplicity",
    ", we focus only on spirals .",
    "a more general treatment of this problem would involve many more free parameters and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "neverthless , we stress that if dwarf galaxies with relatively shallow potential wells make a significant fraction of all damped absorbers , then our analysis overestimates the importance of lensing .",
    "the mass density of neutral hydrogen at @xmath8 , @xmath9 , is comparable to the mass density in stars today , and appears to steadily decline at lower redshifts ( lanzetta , wolfe , & turnshek 1995 ; wolfe 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "the simplest interpretation of this result is that the material in present - day disk galaxies had already assembled at a redshift @xmath10 , while the observed gradual decline of @xmath11 since then is simply a result of the consumption of the gas by star formation .",
    "based on these indications and the evidence that the velocity width of the associated metal lines is indicative of rotational velocities @xmath12 ( wolfe 1995 ) , bartelmann & loeb ( 1996 ) have adopted the view that damped ly@xmath4 absorption in qso spectra results from neutral hydrogen disks in the present - day potential wells of spiral galaxies . following this assumption , they showed that damped ly@xmath4 systems may lens their background qsos .",
    "an important consequence thereof is that the statistics of the absorbers themselves , as inferred from the number and distribution of absorption troughs detected , can be affected by the magnification bias . because of the magnification of their flux due to lensing , the number of qsos observed above a given magnitude threshold",
    "is increased , and consequently the observed fraction of qsos which show damped ly@xmath4 absorption is enhanced .",
    "an effect which tends to counteract the magnification by lensing is obscuration of the source by dust . by now",
    ", there is evidence that damped systems contain measurable quantities of dust",
    ". a dust - to - gas ratio of order 10% of the milky - way value is inferred from the enhanced level of reddening found in a sample of qsos that have damped absorption ( fall , pei , & mcmahon 1989 ; pei , fall , & bechtold 1991 ) , and from the gas - phase depletion of cr relative to zn ( see meyer , welty , & york 1989 ; meyer & roth 1990 ; pettini , boksenberg , & hunstead 1990 ; meyer & york 1992 ; pettini et al .",
    "1994 ; wolfe et al . 1994 ; smith et al . 1996",
    "; although lu , sargent , & barlow ( 1996 ) challenge this view based on the abundances of other metals ) .",
    "by dimming the light of the background sources , dust reduces the number of qsos above a given magnitude threshold ( ostriker & heisler 1984 ; fall & pei 1988 , 1993 ) , thus opposing the effect of the magnification bias due to lensing .",
    "it is thus a relevant issue to consider these two effects simultaneously and to estimate their relative importance .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper .",
    "the detection of lensing by low - redshift spiral galaxies , such as b0218 + 357 at @xmath13 ( odea et al .",
    "1992 ; patnaik et al .",
    "1993 ) , 2237 + 0305 at @xmath14 ( huchra et al . 1995 ) , and b1600 + 434 ( jaunsen & hjorth 1997 ) implies that dust obscuration does not mask lensing altogether .",
    "the efficiency of gravitational lensing is expected to strongly peak in the redshift interval @xmath15 . aside from the tendency of cosmological lenses to maximize their influence around @xmath16 ( schneider , falco , & ehlers 1992 ; bartelmann & loeb 1996 ) , evolutionary phenomena such as the hierarchical merging of halos and the hi consumption by star formation , would tend to reduce the significance of lensing per hi column density at high redshifts .",
    "we therefore focus in this paper only on spiral lenses at low - redshifts @xmath17 . at these redshifts , there are various indications that the potential wells of spirals did not evolve significantly due to merging :    * substantial merging or accretion would have resulted in asymmetric distortion of the isophotes of spiral galaxies . direct observations of the level of lopsidedness in spiral galaxies set an upper limit on the current accretion rate of companions with a mass of order 10% the parent galaxy mass , which is 0.25 companions per gyr ( zaritzky & rix 1996 ) .",
    "this implies that the fractional increase in the mass of galactic disks due to major mergers is smaller than 15% since @xmath18 .",
    "* the thinness and coldness of the stellar distribution in galactic disks imply that these disks did not encounter substantial merging since gas was converted into stars in them .",
    "tth & ostriker ( 1992 ) have obtained an upper limit of 4% on the fraction of the galactic mass inside the solar radius that could have accreted within the last 5 billion years , based on the observed scale and toomre @xmath19parameter of the milky - way disk . * considerable evolution in the potential wells of spiral galaxies since",
    "@xmath20 would have resulted in a considerable scatter in their tully - fisher relation due to variations in their formation histories .",
    "eisenstein & loeb ( 1996 ) have used monte carlo realizations of halo formation histories in hierarchical models of structure formation to limit any substantial evolution in the potential wells of spirals since @xmath21 , based on the observed tightness in their tully - fisher relation . * the statistics of",
    "multiply imaged qsos implies that galactic lenses ( either ellipticals or spirals ) did not encounter significant merging below @xmath21 ( mao & kochanek 1994 ; rix et al .",
    "* measurements of the rotation velocities and luminosities of spiral galaxies at intermediate redshifts ( vogt et al 1996 ) imply that they are kinematically similar to nearby spirals . * deep imaging and spectroscopy in the field of 3c 336 ( steidel et al .",
    "1996 ) show a lack of strong evolution in the population of galactic metal ",
    "line absorbers up to a redshift @xmath20 .    for redshifts below unity ,",
    "the observed evolution in @xmath3 is also very weak ( cf .",
    "fig . 8 in wolfe",
    "et al . 1995 ) .",
    "based on all of this evidence , we adopt a model in which the gravitational potentials and the hi+dust content of the local population of spiral galaxies had not evolved significantly between a redshift of @xmath22 and the present time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we summarize our parameterization of dust at high redshift , focusing on its relation to neutral hydrogen in damped ly@xmath4 systems .",
    "we then examine in  3 the simple situation of gravitational lensing and dust obscuration of a single point source by a single lens .",
    "we turn to statistical considerations in  4 , where we detail our method to calculate the combined effects of gravitational lensing and dust obscuration of a population of background qsos by an intervening population of damped ly@xmath4 absorbers . finally , ",
    "5 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "direct evidence that damped ly@xmath4 systems contain dust is provided by the reddening of background qsos and by the depletion of cr relative to zn .",
    "the amount of dust is usually expressed in terms of the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath23 by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the optical depth due to dust in the rest frame @xmath26 band and @xmath27 is the column density of neutral hydrogen in units of @xmath28 .",
    "the reddening of background qsos can be estimated by comparing the spectral indices of quasars with and without damped ly@xmath4 absorbers .",
    "typical dust - to - gas ratios in the damped ly@xmath4 systems can then be inferred from this reddening estimate if a shape for the extinction curve is assumed .    another way to infer @xmath23",
    "is provided by measurements of the gas - phase abundances of zn , cr , and other trace elements .",
    "the underlying assumption is that , apart from overall scalings in the metallicity and dust - to - gas ratio , the relative composition of the interstellar medium is the same in the damped ly@xmath4 systems as it is in the milky way ( i.e. , the abundance patterns and grain composition are the same in both ) .",
    "measuring the ratio zn / h and the depletion of cr relative to zn , one can estimate the fraction of gaseous cr that has condensed into dust grains .",
    "both methods of measuring @xmath23 yield a typical dust - to - gas ratio for damped ly@xmath4 systems at @xmath29 that is roughly 10% of the milky way value @xmath30 .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio evolves with redshift due to various astrophysical processes , such as conversion of gas into stars , metal enrichment and inflows or outflows of gas from galaxies .",
    "however , since we focus on low redshift absorbers , we assume no evolution in their dust - to - gas ratio , @xmath31    the dust optical depth @xmath32 in an absorber at redshift @xmath33 is related to the optical depth in the @xmath26 band @xmath25 by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the ratio of the extinction at wavelength @xmath36 to that in the @xmath26 band .",
    "observations ( mathis 1990 ; savage & mathis 1979 ) indicate that the extinction curve declines with wavelength roughly as @xmath37 . for wavelengths",
    "not too far from the @xmath26 band , a good fit is provided by @xmath38    in terms of the dust - to - gas ratio as defined in equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) , the optical depth can be written as @xmath39    the intrinsic flux @xmath40 of a source is changed to @xmath41 if it passes an intervening galaxy .",
    "gravitational lensing magnifies the flux by a factor @xmath42 , while obscuration by dust reduces the flux by a factor @xmath43 ( fall & pei 1989 ) .",
    "the net effect is thus @xmath44",
    "we now examine the combined effect of dust obscuration and gravitational lensing in the simple situation of a point source which is lensed and obscured by a single intervening galaxy . for definiteness",
    ", we adopt a source redshift of @xmath45 and a lens redshift of @xmath46 where necessary .",
    "we describe the profile of the neutral hydrogen disk in the galaxy by the radius where the face - on column density is @xmath47 , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the galaxy luminosity , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is a characteristic radius of an @xmath52 galaxy .",
    "the data by broeils & van woerden ( 1994 ) imply an exponential neutral hydrogen profile , @xmath53    for simplicity , we will in this section consider a lensing galaxy with luminosity @xmath52 .",
    "the hydrogen radius of equation  ( [ eq:7 ] ) then simplifies to @xmath54 , where @xmath47 is the face - on column density of hi .",
    "if the disk is inclined by an angle @xmath55 with respect to the line - of - sight , the observed column density is @xmath56 .",
    "the intercepted hi column density not only depends on the relative position of absorber and source , but also on the lensing properties of the absorber because the light rays are bent .",
    "we model the lens as a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) .",
    "recent work ( kochanek 1996 ) has shown that , in the case of elliptical galaxy lenses , the addition of a small core radius , consistent with the kinematics and the image configuration of the lens , does not change the lensing probability significantly . since the light distribution in the central bulge of spiral galaxies resembles that in elliptical galaxies , we assume the sis model to be a good approximation for our purposes .    in the sis model ,",
    "the scaled distances of the source @xmath57 and of the images @xmath58 from the center of the lens are related by ( e.g. , schneider et al .",
    "1992 ) @xmath59 the appropriate length scale for @xmath58 is @xmath60 where @xmath61 are the angular diameter distances from the observer to the lens , to the source , and from the lens to the source , respectively , in units of the hubble length @xmath62 . in the numerical examples throughout the paper , we will use a hubble constant @xmath63 , with @xmath64 , and an @xmath52 galaxy velocity dispersion of @xmath65 .",
    "the magnification of a point source by an sis lens is @xmath66    in order to compute the optical depth due to dust obscuration , we need to calculate the column density @xmath47 of the galactic hi disk where it is intercepted by the light rays from a source at position @xmath57 .",
    "since an inclined disk appears elliptical , the radius in the plane of the disk where the light rays pass the galaxy depends on the relative position angle between @xmath57 and the inclined galactic disk .",
    "for an inclination angle @xmath55 , the radius averaged over position angle is @xmath67 =    \\frac{2x}{\\pi\\cos\\theta}\\,{\\rm e}(\\sin^2\\theta ) \\label{eq:12}\\ ] ] with the elliptical function of the @xmath68 kind @xmath69 .",
    "the hi column density @xmath47 in the disk at the average radius @xmath70 is then found from @xmath71 which can be solved for @xmath47 using @xmath72 from equation  ( [ eq:8 ] ) .",
    "the observed column density @xmath73 as a function of the source position @xmath57 is @xmath74 with @xmath75 given by equation  ( [ eq:9 ] ) .",
    "the optical depth can then be easily computed from equation  ( [ eq:5 ] ) . for the redshifts chosen , @xmath45 and @xmath76 ,",
    "for observations in the b - band , and for a cosmological model with @xmath77 , @xmath78 , we find from equations  ( [ eq:4 ] ) and ( [ eq:10 ] ) @xmath79 for @xmath64 .",
    "we now have all the ingredients to estimate the ratio between the observed and intrinsic fluxes , @xmath41 and @xmath40 , related by equation  ( [ eq:6 ] ) .",
    "the resulting flux ratio @xmath80 is shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] , where @xmath80 is plotted as a function of source position @xmath57 for different values of the inclination angle @xmath55 of the disk .",
    "for comparison , the solid line shows @xmath80 without taking dust obscuration into account .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows that for each inclination angle there is a source position @xmath81 such that magnification dominates over dimming ( i.e. , @xmath82 ) for @xmath83 while extinction is stronger than magnification ( i.e. , @xmath84 ) for @xmath85 . as smaller @xmath57",
    "imply smaller @xmath58 , we find that magnification is stronger than extinction for light rays passing closer to the center of the disk .",
    "we now examine the combined effect of lensing and dust obscuration on a population of distant qsos by a population of intervening galaxies . damped ly@xmath4 systems offer one of the best ways of tracing the evolution of neutral hydrogen in spiral galaxies at intermediate and high redshifts .",
    "we therefore focus on the simultaneous effects of lensing and dust obscuration on the properties of neutral hydrogen which can be inferred from the damped absorption lines .",
    "in particular , we investigate the effects of dust and lensing on the column density distribution function of hi , @xmath86 , and on the estimates of the contribution of hi to the density of the universe @xmath3 .",
    "we model the column density profile of neutral hydrogen in the absorbers according to equations  ( [ eq:7 ] ) and ( [ eq:8 ] ) and assume for simplicity that it is constant in time .",

    "1994 ) , @xmath88    the source population of distant qsos is parameterized in terms of the intrinsic number count function which can be well modeled by a broken power law ( e.g. , boyle , shanks , & peterson 1988 ; hartwick & schade 1990 ) , @xmath89 where the flux @xmath90 at the break point corresponds to an apparent qso magnitude of @xmath91 and @xmath92 is a constant .",
    "a reasonable fit to observational data for the two branches of the power law is provided by the values @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( pei 1995 ) .",
    "if neither lensing nor dust obscuration are effective , the probability for a qso to exhibit damped ly@xmath4 absorption with a column density @xmath95 in its spectrum is given by ( bahcall & peebles 1969 ) @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the absorption distance surveyed per qso , and @xmath98 is the average of ( [ eq:8 ] ) over all inclination angles .",
    "if the absorption probability @xmath99 is measured , the column density distribution of absorbers @xmath86 is given by @xmath100 this expression is independent of the qso redshift , the qso flux , and the redshift interval surveyed for damped ly@xmath4 absorption .    on the other hand ,",
    "if gravitational lensing is taken into account , the probability for damped ly@xmath4 absorption , and thus the column density distribution , does depend on the flux threshold @xmath41 and on the redshifts involved because of the magnification bias ( bartelmann & loeb 1996 ) .",
    "specifically , @xmath101 with @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the probability that a qso at redshift @xmath104 shows damped ly@xmath4 absorption with column density @xmath95 and is magnified by a factor @xmath105 by lenses in the redshift interval @xmath106 around @xmath33 ( cf .  equation  ( 2.25 ) in bartelmann & loeb 1996 ) .",
    "let us now consider the combined effect of lensing and dust obscuration .",

    "this figure shows the observed distribution of @xmath122 for two choices of the limiting flux @xmath26 and for three cosmological models , in comparison to the true distribution ( solid line ) .",

    "the enhancement in the abundance of absorbers ( and hence in the inferred density parameter of neutral hydrogen ) is a consequence of the magnification bias due to lensing , which increases the number of qsos above the detection threshold .",
    "extinction by dust results in an opposite tendency . in figure",
    "4a we show the combined effect of these opposite tendencies as a function of the qso magnitude limit , for low - redshift absorbers with @xmath130 .",
    "the qso detection probability is compared to the case where neither of these two effects are taken into account .",
    "we find that for bright quasars with a limiting magnitude @xmath131 , the effect of lensing dominates . in figure 4b",
    "we compare the above probability to the situation where only lensing is taken into account ( cf . bartelmann & loeb 1996 ) .",
    "this figure illustrates that for low - redshift absorbers , the suppression of the lensing effect by dust is of several tens of percent .",
    "the level of suppression is higher for brighter qsos because of the dependence of the extinction factor on the slope of the qso number counts [ cf .",
    "( [ eq:30 ] ) ] , which is steeper for brighter qsos .",
    "note that the suppression of the lensing probability by dust is weaker than the suppression of the lensing effect on @xmath3 ( compare fig .",
    "5 of bartelmann & loeb ( 1996 ) to fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] in this paper ) .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath3 is integrated with an extra factor of @xmath73 ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ eq:31 ] ) , which tends to emphasize high column density systems more , and therefore enhance the suppression of lensing by dust at a given qso magnitude limit .",
    "gravitational lensing by a spiral galaxy occurs when the line - of - sight to a background quasar passes within a few kpc from the center of the galactic disk . since",
    "galactic disks are rich in neutral hydrogen , the quasar spectrum will likely be marked by a damped absorption trough at the lens redshift .",
    "indeed , the observed 21 cm absorption in the spiral galaxy lens b0218 + 357 implies an hi column density of @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the spin temperature and @xmath134 is the hi covering factor in this system .",
    "bartelmann & loeb ( 1996 ) have shown that the efficiency of searches for gravitational lensing with sub - arcsecond splitting can be enhanced by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude if one focuses on the subset of bright quasars which show low - redshift ( @xmath135 ) strong absorption ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "the double - image signature of lensing could , in principle , be identified spectroscopically and without the need for high - resolution imaging ; the absorption spectrum of the lens might show a generic double - step profile due to the superposition of the two absorption troughs of the different images .",
    "the different images pass the absorbing disk at different impact parameters and therefore have different spectral widths .",
    "lensing of optical sources by spiral galaxies is expected to be counteracted by dust obscuration , since the central opacity of nearby disks is considerable ( see , e.g. byun 1993 ; davies et al . 1993 ; byun , freeman , & kylafis 1994 ; jansen et al . 1994 ; rix 1995 ) . the distribution of dust in galactic disks is correlated with the distribution of neutral hydrogen , which in turn can be probed in the absorption spectra of qsos . in this paper , we used the estimated dust - to - gas ratio of our galaxy and allowed a spread in its values to calculate the effects of dust on lensing by low redshift spiral galaxies . for absorbers with @xmath137",
    ", we have found that the relative importance of the magnification bias due to lensing and of the obscuration due to dust depends on the qso magnitude limit and on the choice of cosmological parameters ( cf .",
    "overall , the effect of dust suppresses the detection probability of lensing by @xmath138 ( cf .",
    "4b ) .    the magnification bias and the deflection of light rays due to lensing change the column density distribution of damped absorbers , @xmath86 .",
    "although dust tends to suppress the distortion to @xmath86 derived by bartelmann & loeb ( 1996 ) , the generic lensing peak for low - redshift absorbers with @xmath139 is still evident in figure  2a .",
    "this peak results from the magnification bias , which raises faint qsos above the detection threshold , thereby enhancing the probability for observing damped absorbers .",
    "the sharp cutoff at yet higher column densities arises because the bending of light rays due to lensing yields a minimum value for the impact parameter of the line - of - sight to the qso through the galactic disk . for low - redshift absorbers and models with no cosmological constant",
    "we have found that the density parameter of neutral hydrogen @xmath3 , obtained by integrating @xmath123 over all column densities , is overestimated for qso samples with @xmath140 and is underestimated for fainter qsos ( cf .",
    "fig .  3 ) .    since the current set of known damped systems includes only a small number of low - redshift absorbers ( see , e.g. table 3 in wolfe et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ) , it is difficult to compare the statistical results shown in figures 24 to existing data .",
    "we expect the significance of lensing relative to dust to decline at @xmath141 , and to yield only a secondary correction to the inferred statistics of the current set of damped absorbers ( wolfe et al .",
    "1995 ; storrie - lombardi et al .",
    "1996a , b ) .",
    "the quantitative predictions of this paper will be tested in a straightforward manner with the advent of absorption data for larger statistical samples of qsos with uniform selection criteria , such as the set of @xmath142 qsos in the forthcoming sloan digital sky survey ( gunn & knapp 1993 ) .",

    "<S> the density parameter of neutral hydrogen , @xmath3 , is overestimated in such samples and is underestimated for fainter qsos .    </S>",
