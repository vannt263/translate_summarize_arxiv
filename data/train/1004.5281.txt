    "correlations of bipartite states , including classical and quantum parts , are of great importance and interest in quantum information theory . quantum discord was proposed to quantify the quantum correlations  @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the quantum discord , rather than entanglement , is responsible for the efficiency of a quantum computer , which is confirmed both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite",
    ". a great deal of efforts has been devoted into the study of quantum discord  @xcite . despite this , it is not easy to obtain analytical results of the quantum discord since the optimization procedure involved is unreachable for arbitrary bipartite states up to now . even for two - qubit systems ,",
    "the analytic results are only known for a few cases  @xcite , and a general method still lacks . to avoid this difficulty and obtain an analytic analysis ,",
    "alternative approaches are needed , among which is the geometric measure of quantum discord ( gmqd ) . despite not reflected in the present work , another advantage of the gmqd is that it could potentially supply a way to put various correlations on an equal footing since the geometric measure of other kinds of correlations can be defined in the same manner but with different sets of zero - correlation states .",
    "it is remarkable that a unified view of correlations has been established through the relative entropy measure of correlations in ref .",
    "the gmqd , similar to the geometry measure of the entanglement  @xcite , is defined as the nearest distance between the given state and the set of zero - discord states . in the present work",
    ", we use the hilbert - schmidt norm as the distance of two quantum states , because for two - qubit systems the minimization of the hilbert - schmidt distance over the set of zero - discord states was resolved analytically in ref .",
    "however , the quantum discord is based on the von neumann entropy while the gmqd is based on the geometric distance , their behaviors may be different .",
    "this motivates us to consider the behaviors of the gmqd under decoherence , and compare it with the quantum discord .    due to the inevitable interaction with environment ,",
    "the dynamics of the quantum discord under decoherence is of great importance .",
    "it has received some investigations  @xcite , and was experimentally investigated in an all - optical setup most recently  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the quantum discord may decay in an asymptotic way under markovian environment  @xcite and vanish only at some time points under non - markovian environment  @xcite .",
    "it can be understood by the facts that the subset of the zero - discord states has measure zero and is nowhere dense  @xcite . while the entanglement suffers form sudden death  @xcite , because the set of separable states occupies finite volume  @xcite .",
    "besides , in some situations , the decay rates of the quantum discord may be discontinuous  @xcite .",
    "this is a novel phenomena and was observed in the recent experiment  @xcite .",
    "notice for a tripartite system @xmath1 in pure states , the quantum discord of @xmath2 and the entanglement of formation ( eof ) of @xmath3 are connected through a monogamy relation  @xcite , so studying the dynamics of the quantum discord will also be helpful to the understanding of the dynamics of eof .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the gmqd under decoherence channels and get the analytical results . under three typical quantum decoherence channels , we will show that the gmqd is monotonically non - decreasing with respect to the quantum discord .",
    "yet , the quantum discord may keep constant while the gmqd decreases .",
    "we will show that in some cases the decay rates of the gmqd and of the quantum discord may suddenly change at the same time .",
    "however , a sudden change in the decay rate of the gmqd does not always imply a sudden change in the decay rate of the quantum discord , and vice versa .",
    "we demonstrate each case by instances . we also give a general analysis for the sudden change in the decay rate of the gmqd and that of the quantum discord , and show that at least for the bell diagonal states , the sudden changes in decay rates of the gmqd and that of the quantum discord occur simultaneously .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gmqd ] , we give a brief introduction of the quantum discord and the gmqd .",
    "then we show that the gmqd of a two - qubit state is related to the singular values of a peculiar @xmath0 matrix . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gmqd_channel ] , we give a general method to obtain the gmqd under quantum decoherence channels , and get the analytic results for three typical kinds of quantum decoherence channel .",
    "we investigate the sudden change in the decay rate of the gmqd , and compare it with the case of the quantum discord .",
    "and we also give a general analysis on the disagreement of sudden change in decay rates between the gmqd and the quantum discord .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] is the conclusion and discussion .",
