    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy has been shown to be a very powerful observational probe of cosmology .",
    "detailed measurements of the anisotropies in the cmb can provide a wealth of information about the global properties , constituents and history of the universe .",
    "in standard cosmology , the cmb anisotropy is expected to be statistically isotropic , _",
    "i.e. _ , statistical expectation values of the temperature fluctuations ( and in particular the angular correlation function ) are preserved under rotations of the sky .",
    "this property of cmb anisotropy has been under scrutiny after the release of the first year of wmap data @xcite .",
    "we use a method based on bipolar expansion of the two point correlation function which is an improved and enhanced follow up on our previous work on first year wmap data @xcite .",
    "this method is shown to be sensitive to structures and patterns in the underlying two - point correlation function .",
    "we apply our method to the improved internal linear combination ( ilc ) map @xcite , based on three year wmap data .",
    "we choose the ilc map for testing statistical isotropy ( si ) of the cmb anisotropy for the following reasons    1 .",
    "the ilc is a full - sky map and hence is easier to work with . masking the sky results in violation of statistical isotropy .",
    "an originally si cmb anisotropy map deviates from si after masking @xcite .",
    "residuals from galactic removal errors in the three - year ilc map are estimated to be less than 5 @xmath0 on angular scales greater than @xmath1 @xcite . hence at low-@xmath2 , multipoles are not significantly affected by foregrounds .",
    "in addition , it is interesting to examine the above statement by testing the statistical isotropy of the ilc map .",
    "3 .   on large scales",
    ", the three - year ilc map is believed to provide a reliable estimate of the cmb signal , with negligible instrument noise , over the full sky @xcite .",
    "these properties of the ilc map allow us to study the cosmological signal on large scales .",
    "in addition , there are theoretical motivations for hunting for si violation on large scales of cmb anisotropy .",
    "topologically compact spaces  @xcite and anisotropic cosmological models   are examples of this .",
    "both observational artifacts and the above theoretical models cause a departure from statistical isotropy and it has been shown that our method is a useful tool to find out these deviations ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section [ characterization ] is a brief introduction to temperature anisotropy of cmb .",
    "section [ sisection ] describes the formulation of statistical isotropy in general .",
    "section [ estimators ] is a description of estimators we use to look for deviations from statistical isotropy .",
    "we present the application of our method on the wmap data in section [ data ] .",
    "section [ discussion ] contains discussion on the cosmological implications of our null detection of deviations from statistical isotropy on large angular scales in 3-year ilc map of wmap data , and in section [ summary ] we summarize our results .",
    "the cmb anisotropy is fully described by its temperature anisotropy and polarization .",
    "the temperature anisotropy is a scalar random field , @xmath3 , on a 2-dimensional surface of a sphere ( the sky ) , where @xmath4 is a unit vector on the sphere and @xmath5 represents the mean temperature of the cmb .",
    "it is convenient to expand the temperature anisotropy field into spherical harmonics , the orthonormal basis on the sphere , as [ yelemexpand ] t ( ) = _ l , m a_lmy_lm ( ) , where the complex quantities , @xmath6 are given by [ alm ] a_lm = .",
    "statistical properties of this field can be characterized by @xmath7-point correlation functions [ npoint ] t(_1 ) t(_2)t(_n ) . here",
    "the bracket denotes the ensemble average , _",
    "i.e. _ an average over all possible configurations of the field .",
    "cmb anisotropy is believed to be gaussian @xcite .",
    "hence the connected part of @xmath7-point functions disappears for @xmath8 .",
    "non - zero ( even-@xmath7)-point correlation functions can be expressed in terms of the @xmath9-point correlation function . as a result",
    ", a gaussian distribution is completely described by the two - point correlation function c(,)= t ( ) t( ) . equivalently ; as it is seen from eqn .",
    "( [ alm ] ) , for a gaussian cmb anisotropy , @xmath6 are complex gaussian random variables too .",
    "therefore , the _ covariance matrix _ ,",
    "@xmath10 , fully describes the whole field . throughout this paper",
    "we assume gaussianity to be valid .",
    "two point correlations of cmb anisotropy , @xmath11 , are two point functions on @xmath12 , and hence can be expanded as [ bipolar ] c(_1 , _ 2 ) = _",
    "y^l_1l_2_m(_1 , _ 2 ) .",
    "here @xmath13 are coefficients of the expansion ( hereafter biposh coefficients ) and @xmath14 are bipolar spherical harmonics defined by eqn .",
    "( [ bipolars ] ) .",
    "bipolar spherical harmonics form an orthonormal basis on @xmath15 and transform in the same manner as the spherical harmonic function with @xmath16 with respect to rotations @xcite .",
    "one can inverse - transform @xmath11 in eqn .",
    "( [ bipolar ] ) to get the coefficients of expansion , @xmath13 , by multiplying both sides of eqn.([bipolar ] ) by @xmath17 and integrating over all angles .",
    "then the orthonormality of bipolar harmonics , eqn .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) , implies that [ alml1l2 ] = d__1d__2 c(_1 , _ 2 ) y^*l_1l_2_m(_1,_2 ) . the above expression and the fact that @xmath11 is symmetric under the exchange of @xmath18 and @xmath19 leads to the following symmetries of @xmath13 [ sym ] & = & ( -1)^(l_1+l_2-l ) , + & = & _ , 2k , k=0,1,2,3 , .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that bipolar spherical harmonic ( biposh ) coefficients , @xmath13 , are in fact linear combinations of off - diagonal elements of the covariance matrix , [ almvsalm ] = _",
    "m_1m_2 a_l_1m_1a^*_l_2 m_2(-1)^m_2 c^m_l_1m_1l_2 -m_2 . where @xmath20 are clebsch - gordan coefficients ( see the appendix).this clearly shows that @xmath13 completely represent the information of the covariance matrix .",
    "when statistical isotropy holds , it is guaranteed that the covariance matrix is diagonal , a_lma^*_l m= c_l _ ll^ _ mm and hence the angular power spectra carry all information of the field . substituting this into eqn .",
    "( [ almvsalm ] ) gives [ sialm1 ] = ( -1)^l c_l ( 2l+1)^1/2 _ ll^ _ 0 _ m0 .",
    "the above expression tells us that when statistical isotropy holds , all biposh coefficients , @xmath21 , are zero except those with @xmath22 which are equal to the angular power spectra up to a @xmath23 factor .",
    "biposh expansion is the most general way of studying two point correlation functions of cmb anisotropy . the well known angular power spectrum",
    ", @xmath24 is in fact a subset of the corresponding biposh coefficients , [ sialm ] c_l= .",
    "therefore to test a cmb map for statistical isotropy , one should compute the biposh coefficients for the maps and look for nonzero biposh coefficients .",
    "statistically significant deviations from zero would mean violation of statistical isotropy .",
    "given a cmb anisotropy map , one can measure biposh coefficients bye the following estimator [ estimator ] = _ m m^ a_lma_l^m^ ^m_lml^m^ , where @xmath25 is the legendre transform of the window function . the above estimator is a combination of @xmath24 and hence is un - biased .",
    "however it is impossible to measure all @xmath26 individually because of cosmic variance .",

    "the top map ( ilc-3 ) has smaller fluctuations comparing to the middle one ( ilc-1 ) except for the hot spot near the equator .",
    "differences between these two maps mostly arise from a band around the equator _ in bipolar space_. both ilc maps are smoothed by a band pass filter , @xmath28 . ]      among the several possible combinations of biposh coefficients , the bipolar power spectrum ( bips ) was proved to be a useful tool with interesting features @xcite .",

    "l , l,m    _ i.e. _ invariant under rotations of the sky . for models in which statistical isotropy is valid ,",

    "we define [ dell ] d _ = _ m=-^ a_m a_m^*. the above estimator is rotationally invariant .",
    "it has a positive bias and hence it has similar issues that have been addressed for the bips studies earlier .",

    "bips results shown in figure [ bips_fig ] agree with our results on @xmath33 .",
    "it can be seen that ilc-3 has a smaller bipolar power spectrum than ilc-1 and is more consistent with statistical isotropy .",
    "the same is true for @xmath37 estimator defined by eqn .",
    "( [ dell ] ) which we defer to the future publications .",

    "the null results of search for departure from statistical isotropy has implications for the observation and data analysis techniques used to create the cmb anisotropy maps .",
    "observational artifacts such as non - circular beam , inhomogeneous noise correlation , residual striping patterns , and residuals from foregrounds are potential sources of si breakdown .",

    "it is shown that 3-year ilc map is `` cleaner '' than 1-year ilc map at @xmath60 .",

    "it has also been observed that at large @xmath2 deviations from statistical isotropy occur which we think is because of residuals from foregrounds .",

    "each of these models will cause departures from statistical isotropy in cmb anisotropy maps . and",
    "a null detection of departure from statistical isotropy at low @xmath2 in the wmap data can be used to put constraints on these models .",
    "our measure is sensitive to axial asymmetries in the two point correlation of the temperature anisotropy @xcite . and",
    "this is even more significant now because the new measure of reduced bipolar coefficients does retain directional information .",
    "our analysis does nt show a significant detection of an `` axis of evil '' in the wmap data .",
    "we have redone our analysis on ilc map filtered with a low - pass filter that only keeps @xmath61 to search for a preferred direction at low multipoles .",
    "we have not been able to detect any significant deviation from statistical isotropy using various filters .",
    "we could not test the effect of alignment of low multipoles on statistical isotropy because we had no theory or model to explain them .",
    "validity of statistical isotropy at large angular scales can put tight constraints on anisotropic mechanisms that are candidates of explaining the low quadrupole of the wmap and cobe data .",
    "it is worth noticing that our method can be extended to polarization maps of cmb anisotropy .",
    "analysis of statistical isotropy of full - sky polarization maps of wmap are currently under progress and will be reported in a separate publication .",
    "we examine statistical isotropy of large scale anisotropies of the improved internal linear combination ( ilc ) map , based on three year wmap data . in order to attribute a statistical significance to our results",

    "we have done our analysis using a series of filters that span the low-@xmath2 multipoles .",
