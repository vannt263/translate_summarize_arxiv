    "the search for supersymmetry ( susy ) should be one of the primary goals at the fermilab tevatron and any future collider planned or in construction . while @xmath1 colliders generally have the advantage of unambiguously finding or excluding superpartners up to @xmath2 , their mass reach is strictly energy limited .",
    "lep  ii , the highest energy @xmath1 collider approved , will be able to probe chargino masses up to about @xmath3 but no further .",
    "a useful complement to lep  ii s important contributions to the search for supersymmetry is provided by a luminosity upgraded fermilab tevatron @xmath4 collider at @xmath5 .",
    "as we shall subsequently describe , if the correct supersymmetric theory has a chargino mass below @xmath3 , the upgraded tevatron might possibly fail to discover it ( hence the importance of lep  ii ) ; however , a high luminosity tevatron does have the capability of discovering supersymmetry at mass scales _ far exceeding _ the capabilities of lep  ii .",
    "in this paper we report the results of our simulations of many supersymmetric signals for a @xmath4 collider at @xmath5 . to this end",
    ", we introduce an implementation of all tree level mssm processes and decay modes in the event generators pythia and jetset  @xcite .",
    "this implementation of the mssm is not only a cross check of isasusy  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , which uses the isajet  @xcite generator , but includes the refinements inherent to the pythia / jetset system .",
    "the full details of the event generator will be published in a forthcoming technical report  @xcite .",
    "an equally important task is to run the simulations on supersymmetric solutions which could be the correct theory of nature .",
    "therefore , we have simulated supersymmetric events in the context of the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm )  @xcite .",
    "briefly , the cmssm enforces gauge coupling unification at the `` unification '' scale @xmath6@xmath7 , enforces proper electroweak symmetry breaking , assumes common scalar masses ( @xmath8 ) , common gaugino masses ( @xmath9 ) , and common trilinear scalar soft couplings ( @xmath10 ) at the unification scale , requires r  parity conservation , and imposes all known experimental constraints such as limits on @xmath11 decays , invisible width constraints on @xmath12 at lep , etc . each supersymmetric `` solution '' , with all of its masses and mixings , is determined by five input parameters @xmath13 ( we use @xmath14 gev . )",
    "our convention is that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the vev which gives mass to the up  type ( down  type ) fermions .",
    "our convention for the relative sign of @xmath18 is reflected by our choice of the chargino mass matrix element @xmath19 and the neutralino mass matrix elements @xmath20 ( which is the opposite convention from haber and kane  @xcite ) .",
    "the requirements we impose on our supersymmetric solutions are consistent and interrelated .",
    "while it is not absolutely necessary for nature to follow all of our theoretical assumptions ( such as common scalar masses ) , we do wish to emphasize that each requirement supports the other requirements to some degree .",
    "for example , the experimental requirements such as limits on flavor changing neutral currents support , although do not absolutely require , the theoretical preference in supergravity that all scalars have a common mass at the high scale .",
    "similarly , gauge coupling unification supports the notion of r  parity conservation  @xcite , implying an absolutely stable lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , which is the lightest neutralino @xmath21 . proper electroweak symmetry breaking , which is meticulously enforced in the cmssm , gives the lsp the right properties to be a natural weakly interacting cold dark matter particle , explaining many astrophysical _ observations",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "one of the strengths of the cmssm is that it is strongly constrained and theoretically restrictive .",
    "we believe it is remarkable progress that it is possible to construct consistent supersymmetric models that incorporate all the above constraints and provide rich phenomenological predictions .",
    "in general it is always appropriate to study the simplest ( hence minimal ) theory that is consistent with what is known from the standard model ( sm ) , while simultaneously extending our understanding of nature .",
    "the cmssm is minimal in the sense that it has the spectrum and group structure of the sm plus superpartners while implementing the minimal supergravity boundary conditions at the unification scale .    using the cmssm framework we have performed _",
    "event_level analyses of the chargino ",
    "neutralino trilepton signal , the chargino  chargino and slepton  slepton dilepton signals , the slepton  sneutrino and chargino  lsp monolepton signals , the squark / gaugino @xmath0 + jets signal and the signals from stop production and top decays to stop assuming various integrated luminosity scenarios ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) for an upgraded fermilab tevatron collider . there have been several previous studies of supersymmetric signals  @xcite all of which are useful and demonstrate the possibility of detecting supersymmetric signals at fermilab , but often make unrealistic assumptions about supersymmetry or make simplifications in the simulation of the signal and background .",
    "this study is more general ; we find several results different from other studies which stem from two basic principles unique to our approach .",
    "first , we only consider values of susy parameters which are consistent with the cmssm .",
    "second , within this general framework , we examine all parameters rather than a set of special cases .",
    "it is possible to construct supersymmetric frameworks that modify some of the theoretical assumptions and this may be necessary in the future .",
    "however , since we sample the supersymmetric parameter space with thousands of solutions , it is likely that many alternatives will lie in regions we have already covered in this study",
    ". hence , the conclusions of this paper are not likely to be significantly modified .",
    "in fact , there are already some hints from lep data that suggest going beyond the minimality of the cmssm is necessary due to the @xmath25 and @xmath26 measurements  @xcite .",
    "if these measurements are manifestations of non - minimal supersymmetry , then we expect very light charginos and stops to exist , and therefore the fermilab tevatron will have a much greater chance to discover them .",
    "we organize this paper as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly explain the event simulation needed for every allowed solution in the cmssm parameter space .",
    "section 3 contains the motivation and results for each signal we have studied .",
    "we perform a full background analysis on every signal , specifying the cuts needed to reduce backgrounds . from the background estimates",
    "we determine the detectability or significance of each signal for particular integrated luminosities . in section 3.1",
    "we examine monolepton and dilepton signals , in section 3.2 we examine the trilepton signal and in section 3.3 we examine in detail the effect of constraints on supersymmetric parameter space with trilepton detection as an example . in section 3.4",
    "we examine the @xmath0 + jets signal , in section 3.5 we examine the signals from stop production and in section 3.6 we comment on the signal from top decays to stop . in section 4",
    "we discuss going beyond the cmssm , including possible effects on supersymmetric signals and detection .",
    "finally , in section 5 we conclude with a summary of our results and a brief discussion of how a high luminosity fermilab tevatron would complement lep  ii .",
    "each solution defined by the supersymmetric parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 is considered a complete potential theory of nature with well - defined low energy ( weak scale ) masses , couplings , etc .",
    ", obtained from running the masses and couplings from the unification scale to the weak scale .",
    "all of these low energy parameters must be set for each solution .",
    "then , events are generated using 2to2 cross section formulae  @xcite incorporated into pythia , which also generates initial and final state qcd and qed radiation .",
    "each 2to2 process is derived from a @xmath29 collision using the cteq2l structure functions .",
    "the sparticle decays are based on 2body and 3body formulae for the decay rates  @xcite added to jetset , which performs string fragmentation and hadronization .",
    "the final output of the event generator is a list of `` stable '' particles and their 4-momenta .",
    "these particles are then fed into a model detector which smears momenta based on gaussian energy resolution functions and defines jets based on @xmath30 towers with @xmath31 segmentation . the detector ",
    "level variables are used to define the experimental quantities upon which kinematic cuts are based .",
    "our model detector is based loosely on the cdf detector  @xcite .",
    "the calorimeter is segmented @xmath32 with @xmath33 coverage to @xmath34 .",
    "the hadronic energy resolution is chosen so that the jet resolution is roughly @xmath35 with a degradation to @xmath36 for large @xmath33 .",
    "the electromagnetic energy resolution is @xmath37 , and the muon momentum resolution is @xmath38 .",
    "electrons , muons , and jets are identified for @xmath39 2.5 , though the whole calorimeter is used to define the @xmath40 vector .",
    "isolated leptons @xmath41 are defined as electrons and muons with @xmath42 2 gev within a cone @xmath43 around the lepton .",
    "the sum @xmath44 is over all leptons , photons , and hadrons .",
    "jets @xmath45 are defined with @xmath46 and @xmath47 gev .",
    "every signal must go through a process where thousands of supersymmetric solutions are simulated each with thousands of events .",
    "the final result is a set of observables ( cross sections , decay rates ) which we analyze in the form of scatter plots with each point representing a possible supersymmetric theory of nature .",
    "we consider several potential signals and backgrounds for the fermilab tevatron @xmath48 collider at @xmath49  =  2  tev in the following sections organized by the particular detection signature . in section 3.3",
    "we have performed a detailed analysis of the effect of constraints on the supersymmetric parameter space with the trilepton signal as our example .",
    "we have simulated the monolepton signals from @xmath50 , @xmath51 production and the dilepton signals from @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 production  @xcite .",
    "of course any monolepton signal must compete against the huge background from @xmath56 production which is @xmath57 nb . for the supersymmetric signals , the energy spectrum of the lepton from the 2body decay of the @xmath58 or the ( 2body or 3body ) decay of the @xmath59 is generally soft because most of the energy is carried by the superpartner decay product @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , the classic @xmath0 signature for susy does not easily distinguish signal from background . in the end",
    ", we could find no set of straightforward cuts which could reliably extract a monolepton susy signal at the fermilab tevatron at any luminosity .",
    "the dilepton signals appear much more promising , since the large background from @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be significantly reduced with an @xmath0 cut and an invariant mass cut on opposite sign leptons near the @xmath62 mass . however , the background from the smaller @xmath63 production is virtually irreducible at a total leptonic cross section of 550  fb ( without any cuts ) .",
    "we applied a minimal set of cuts and found the dilepton signals from @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are extremely difficult to pull out of the @xmath64 background of roughly @xmath6140 fb ( with our cuts ) .",
    "only the @xmath52 signal is visible in a small number of solutions with a chargino mass reach of @xmath65 @xmath680 gev , @xmath6110 gev and @xmath6130 gev for integrated luminosities of 200 @xmath66 , 2 @xmath67 and 25 @xmath67 .",
    "no limits on chargino masses could be extracted even at an integrated luminosity of 25 @xmath67 .",
    "it is possible that some of the solutions with detectable trilepton signals described in the next section could be confirmed by the dilepton signal  @xcite .",
    "the trilepton signal from @xmath68 production is probably the most promising signal of supersymmetry at a hadron collider  @xcite . although the signal is obtained from the chargino decaying to one lepton and the neutralino decaying to two leptons as in the previous section , the resulting trilepton signature has two clear advantages over the monolepton and dilepton signals .",
    "first , the correlations induced between the mass and mixing parameters in the cmssm almost invariably output a lightest chargino which is mostly a charged wino ( @xmath69 ) and a second lightest neutralino which is largely a neutral wino ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "thus , the coupling at the @xmath71 vertex is near maximal in the cmssm since it is the supersymmetrized version of the @xmath72 standard model vertex .",
    "second and most important , the trilepton signal has few sizeable backgrounds in stark contrast to the monolepton and dilepton signals . in this section",
    "we explore all aspects of the trilepton signal including a full background analysis and a complete examination of the cmssm parameter space .",
    "there are six sources of physics s that `` fake '' an electron .",
    "the dominant background where this can occur is for @xmath73 es/@xmath18 s with a @xmath74 ( and @xmath0 ) in the final state .",
    "we find that at a `` fake '' rejection rate @xmath75 our set of cuts effectively eliminates this background .",
    "] backgrounds relevant to the trilepton signal : @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath82 backgrounds have been studied before ( see _ e.g. _  refs .",
    "our results are similar , but more general since we study both the traditional backgrounds ( first three ) and also backgrounds from the leptonic decays of @xmath83 quarks including those from @xmath84 splitting .",
    "the latter can be important especially if one considers measuring leptons with low @xmath85 gev , as we do in this study . for the @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath86 backgrounds",
    ", we properly incorporate the effect of @xmath87 interference in @xmath62 production and use the full @xmath88 matrix elements inherent in the pythia monte carlo generator .",
    "we also find it is essential to simulate all possible decay channels of gauge bosons that could possibly lead to leptons in the final state ( _ i.e. _ ,  we include the tau decay channels ) . in the end",
    ", we find the @xmath76 and @xmath77 backgrounds are the most difficult to eliminate , since they contain real isolated leptons ( distinguishable from leptons from heavy quark decay which are generally not isolated from hadrons ) .",
    "below , we enumerate the kinematic cuts applied and the physics motivation behind them .    * three isolated leptons ( electrons or muons ) to reduce qcd backgrounds with @xmath89 cuts of ( @xmath90  ;  @xmath91  ;  @xmath92 )  gev for the highest ( 1 ) , next highest ( 2 ) , and lowest ( 3 ) @xmath89 leptons .",

    "the interference for @xmath125 is largest for @xmath126 , while the interference for @xmath127 occurs over the entire range of @xmath27 .",

    "[ trileptons ] .",
    "we note that to compute the decay widths of @xmath129 , one must evaluate all masses ( and couplings ) at the scale of @xmath130  @xcite . since there are completely general upper mass bounds  @xcite on @xmath131 , the only decay channels open to @xmath129 are to @xmath132 , @xmath133 and lighter particles . when @xmath134 and @xmath135 are evaluated at @xmath130 , the leptonic decay width of @xmath136 is about 10% .",
    "this has a dramatic effect on the leptonic branching ratio of the @xmath116 when both @xmath137 s decay leptonically to @xmath138 s and @xmath18 s .",
    "further , it is likely that 1prong pion decays from the higgs are measurable and could be added to the branching fraction ; thus all the @xmath139 s in fig .",
    "[ trileptons ] ( which have a large branching ratio to @xmath129 ) would move up in cross section by a factor of about 23 .",
    "however , accurate estimates of 1prong backgrounds are more difficult than leptonic backgrounds , so to be conservative we do not include isolated pions in our signal .",
    "the final result is that we find the trilepton signal is present and detectable given a high enough integrated luminosity even for large neutralino masses ( @xmath140 gev ) where the @xmath128 decay channel is open .    once the cross section and branching ratios are computed , a full event  level simulation was performed using the cuts described above .",
    "the cuts undoubtedly have an impact on the detectable signal , and we quantify this by defining the `` detection efficiency '' as the ratio of the number of 3 lepton events that passed our cuts to the total number of 3 lepton events from @xmath68 production .",
    "we find that the efficiency can vary dramatically over the parameter space , as is illustrated in fig .",

    "the structure of the efficiency plot is clear : at low chargino masses ( @xmath141 gev ) most of the @xmath59 , @xmath116 decays are 3body with a gradual rise in efficiency due to the increasing energy of the leptons .",
    "the low efficiency solutions ( eff @xmath142 , where we found the eff to be @xmath143 for _ all _ solutions ) occur when @xmath144 and the 2body sneutrino modes are open and there is little energy for the lepton .",
    "the neutralino also has analogous problems when @xmath145 so that 2body modes are open with one rather soft lepton . at higher chargino masses ( @xmath146 gev ) ,",
    "the 2body decays @xmath147 and @xmath148 also cause a lower efficiency for the simple reason that our _ cuts _ are designed to eliminate real @xmath103 s and @xmath62 s . finally , the somewhat lower efficiency of the @xmath128 mode is visible at high chargino masses ( @xmath149 gev ) . note that the efficiencies described here ( visible in fig .",

    "we expect that nature is described by an r  parity conserving supersymmetric theory  @xcite , and thus the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is absolutely stable . in the early universe",
    "these stable particles were in thermal equilibrium with the photons until the expansion rate of the universe became roughly equal to their annihilation rate .",
    "when this happens , the lsps fall out of equilibrium with the photons and their relic abundance stabilizes .",
    "if this decoupling occurs too soon ( weak annihilation rates ) then the universe becomes matter dominated too early .",
    "most observational data indicates that the universe is more than about 10 billion years old , and this translates into an upper bound on the relic density of lsps .",
    "quantitatively this upper bound , often called the `` age of the universe constraint '' , is most often expressed as a condition on @xmath165 : _ lsp h^2<1.0  ( age  of  the  universe  constraint ) where @xmath166 is the hubble parameter . as part of the cmssm we require @xmath167 .",
    "except for a few possible pathological cases  @xcite , the age of the universe constraint will exclude all susy models with large squark and slepton masses  @xcite .",
    "this can be understood by realizing that the lsp is mostly ( but not completely ) bino in the cmssm , and the bino has no coupling to the @xmath62 boson and therefore no annihilation channels through an @xmath168channel @xmath62 are accessible .",

    "since the @xmath21 is invisible and the stop will be hard to see with the soft jets originating through @xmath217 decays , perhaps the only way to detect the effects of the light stops and lsps is through modification of the @xmath243 branching ratio .",
    "the best way to test for the existence of these stops is through stop production . since in the @xmath244 region of parameter space",
    "the stops will decay primarily through a one  loop diagram to a charm and an lsp , good charm tagging would be extremely helpful if this signal has a chance of being distinguished from other copious jet sources .",
    "all analyses in this paper are based on the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) described in the introduction .",
    "the cmssm is more general than the sm since it includes the sm fully , it is a consistent theory , it incorporates phenomena not explained by the sm such as the apparent unification of the gauge couplings , and provides a derivation of the higgs mechanism rather than assuming it as in the sm .",
    "further , we have seen from section 3 that the cmssm makes a variety of testable predictions .    however , there is a hint that the cmssm may not be entirely correct because its theoretical assumptions about supersymmetric parameters are too restrictive .",
    "the purpose of this section is to point out this possibility and the implications for supersymmetry searches at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "there are two effects that are clues to go beyond the cmssm .",
    "first , the br(@xmath245 ) is larger than its sm value by about @xmath246 .",
    "second , the value of @xmath26 deduced in lep analyses from the @xmath62 width is larger by about @xmath246 than the value of @xmath26 deduced other ways . while neither of these effects is of great `` statistical '' significance ,",
    "both are based on a number of independent measurements over several years from several detectors ; the errors are mostly systematic and theoretical .",
    "the possible importance of these effects is stated in ref .",
    "@xcite , which finds that by including light superpartners in the analysis of the lep data , both effects can be simultaneously explained . in particular , it is remarkable that the lep @xmath26 measurement becomes consistent with other @xmath26 measurements ( at @xmath247 ) when light charginos and stops are included .",
    "further , ref .",
    "@xcite reports a global analysis of the lep / slc data to ensure that no other observable is adversely affected by the light superpartner contribution ( such as @xmath248 or @xmath3 ) .",
    "one finds the supersymmetry fit is actually better than the sm fit , giving better agreement to , for example , the @xmath25 and @xmath249 measurements .",
    "the better agreement requires both @xmath65 and @xmath250 to be less than about 100 gev .",
    "surprisingly , the properties of the chargino and stop are sufficiently well determined by the above analysis that one is forced into concluding that the theoretical assumptions of the cmssm can not be fully correct .",
    "the required mixture  @xcite of gaugino and higgsino in the chargino , and the left ",
    "right mixing for the stop , are not allowed by the cmssm , though they are fully allowed by the theory when particular assumptions about parameters in the cmssm are relaxed .",
    "there has not been time to construct constrained models based on the non - minimal theory , but we can summarize the expected impact on the opportunity to detect superpartners at the fermilab tevatron .    first , and most important , the light chargino and stop should be fully produced at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "the stop production is predominantly via gluons and is unaffected since the cross section is independent of @xmath211 , @xmath212 mixing . the chargino production rate will also not be greatly affected over the parameter space .",
    "kinematically , since charginos and stops are lighter than about 100 gev , there is no suppression at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "the signatures and detection will be different , and can be more difficult .",
    "the analysis for stop production and detection is largely the same .",
    "however , charginos that resolve the @xmath26 `` crisis '' are more higgsino  like than cmssm charginos , which implies the lsp mass is closer to the chargino mass , and so the resulting leptons are softer ( hence fewer leptons pass the @xmath89 cut ) .",
    "one new helpful feature does enter , in that now all stops are lighter than tops , so detecting stops in top decay is a major opportunity .",
    "the br(@xmath251 + lsp ) has a factor of @xmath252 and the usual phase space factor , plus a factor of @xmath253 that is the supersymmetric modification from the higgsino wave functions and the top ",
    "stop coupling .",
    "numerically , we find @xmath254 br(@xmath251 + lsp ) @xmath255 for @xmath256 gev , to @xmath257 br(@xmath251 + lsp ) @xmath258 for @xmath259 gev .",
    "once the decay @xmath251 + lsp has occurred , the analysis of @xmath260 decays is as before , with @xmath261 dominating if it is open , and @xmath262 otherwise . for chargino detection a new analysis is required to correctly calculate the br @xmath139 eff for the trilepton signal , and the needed models have not yet been analyzed .",
    "qualitatively , as remarked above , the leptons will be a little softer , so lowering the lepton triggers will increase the efficiency , and gains by going to softer leptons may be major .",
    "the interference effect and the invisible @xmath117 mode may not cause such a large suppression of the leptonic branching ratio of the neutralino as in the cmssm , possibly improving the situation for some of the parameter space .    in summary ,",
    "if the lep @xmath25 measurement and the @xmath26 crisis are telling us that light charginos and stops exist , then they are already being produced at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "the challenge is to detect them .",
    "the analysis based on the cmssm , or an extended theory , can help thinking about signature and detection efficiency , and help the interpretation if no signal is found .",
    "if light charginos and stops are there , high luminosity and a careful search is needed to find them .",
    "we have conducted a thorough study of many possible supersymmetry signals at a luminosity upgraded fermilab tevatron collider .",
    "our studies have complemented and often improved on others using our full _",
    "event_level monte carlo based on pythia / jetset coupled with a comprehensive approach to constrained minimal supersymmetric parameter space .",
    "we conclude , consistent with earlier work , that the trilepton signal and gluino production are the most useful signals to discover supersymmetry at the fermilab tevatron collider .",
    "although no limits could be placed on the mass of the lightest chargino if no signal were detected , the discovery potential at fermilab is quite large , extending to chargino masses well beyond that which can be probed by lep  ii . with integrated luminosities of 200 @xmath66 , 2 @xmath67 and 25 @xmath67",
    ", the fermilab tevatron can reach to chargino masses of 140 gev , 210 gev and 240 gev respectively .",

    "the stop production signal at fermilab has a stop mass reach up to @xmath6160 gev at @xmath239 significance in the @xmath103 + jets channel with an integrated luminosity of 2 @xmath67 . at an integrated luminosity of 25 @xmath67",
    ", fermilab has a stop mass reach up to @xmath6200 gev at @xmath239 significance for stop production in both the @xmath103 + jets and the dilepton channels .",
    "while searches at lep can likely find or exclude chargino and stop masses up to nearly the beam energy @xmath264 , searches at the fermilab tevatron have a reach @xmath623 times that of lep  ii .",
    "but , the fermilab tevatron can not set mass limits if no signal is found because sets of parameters exist that give smaller @xmath110 than can be detected .",
