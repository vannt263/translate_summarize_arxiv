    "the original idea of yukawa that nn interaction at long distances is due to one pion exchange ( ope ) was verified quantitatively by the nijmegen benchmarking partial wave analysis for nn scattering in the elastic region with @xmath2 ; a partial wave and energy dependent square well potential was considered for distances below 1.4 - 1.8 fm  @xcite while the neutral and charged pion masses could be determined from the fit to their currently accepted pdg values assuming ope above such distances .",
    "the verification of other meson exchanges is less straightforward from nn elastic scattering since the shortest resolution distance probed at the pion production threshold is about @xmath3 and effectively short distance interactions admit a variety of parameterizations and forms  @xcite which show up quantitatively when nucleons are placed off - shell by the presence of a third particle .",
    "already in the simplest case of a photon as the additional particle either in the initial or final state ( see @xcite and references therein ) gauge invariance relates meson exchange potentials and currents ( mec s ) but also requires that hamiltonian eigenstates are used to compute electroweak matrix elements . clearly , one should not expect to know the longitudinal currents any better than potentials .",
    "ambiguities in transverse , i.e. non - minimal coupling , terms of the current just reflect the composite character of nucleons as well as their finite size . in the obe potential ,",
    "strong form factors are added to mimic this finite size  @xcite , which is about @xmath4 . in the case of gauge invariance ,",
    "the inclusion of a form - factor introduced by hand , i.e. , not computed consistently within meson theory , implies a kind of non - locality in the interaction which could be made gauge invariant by introducing link operators between two points , thereby generating a path dependence , for which no obvious resolution has been found yet .",
    "note that purely phenomenological potentials not based entirely on the meson exchange picture are inherently ambiguous .",
    "if the corresponding nn wave functions are combined with mec s conflicting results with gauge invariance are eventually produced .",
    "since the finite size of the nucleon is comparable to the minimal resolution probed in nn scattering , we do not expect to see the difference between a point - like nucleon and an extended one at sufficiently low energies .",
    "recently  @xcite we have suggested replacing strong form factors in the nn potential by renormalization conditions on low energy scattering properties . in the lowest partial waves we have shown that _",
    "after _ renormalization finite nucleon effects parameterized as strong form factors are indeed marginal .",
    "we suggest using renormalization ideas for potentials , wave functions and currents computed consistently . in the present contribution",
    "we review our findings  @xcite and apply them to analyze the radiative neutron capture , @xmath5 , a nuclear reaction where the mec are known to be essential  @xcite .",
    "a useful and simplifying assumption arises from our observation that the symmetry pattern of the sum rules for the old nuclear wigner and serber symmetries discussed in refs .",

    "so , one might think that this meson would be as important as the pion itself .",
