    "such blueshifted absorption features are understood to arise along lines of sight which pass through radiatively driven winds with terminal velocities reaching 0.10.3@xmath1 .",
    "these energetic outflows are important components of quasar environments ; mass ejection is apparently fundamentally linked to active mass accretion .",

    "x - ray studies of bal quasars thus offer a privileged view through the wind .",
    ", width=415 ]    the challenge of accelerating gas to the high velocities observed in bal quasars led @xcite to a picture similar to that presented in figure  [ fig : murray ] . in this model , at radii starting at @xmath2  cm for a @xmath3  black hole , radiation and gas pressure lift material from the disk photosphere where it is struck by light from the inner accretion disk and corona .",
    "the wind , initially co - rotating with the disk , is accelerated radially by the momentum of uv line photons ; the material launched from the innermost radii reaches the highest terminal velocities . in order to launch the wind at such small distances ,",
    "a thick layer of `` shielding '' gas , highly ionized plasma with @xmath4@xmath5  , was introduced to protect the wind from becoming completely ionized by soft x - rays . in the subsequent hydrodynamical modeling of line - driven quasar winds by @xcite ,",
    "this layer of shielding gas arose naturally from the simulations .",
    "this scenario produces several predictions for x - ray observations of bal quasars :    * bal quasars should have intrinsic x - ray continuum shapes ( with @xmath6 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and spectral energy distributions typical of radio - quiet quasars . *",
    "all bal quasars should be x - ray weak , i.e. , have values of @xmath7 @xmath8 ,  measures the relative flux densities at rest - frame 2  kev and 2500   . for reference ,",
    "a sample of low - redshift radio - quiet quasars without known absorption has @xmath7@xmath9 @xcite ; more negative values of @xmath7  indicate a quasar is x - ray weak relative to its uv power . ] as a result of large column densities of absorbing gas .",
    "furthermore , with data of sufficient quality , the spectra will show the signatures of absorption by highly ionized gas . *",
    "a correlation between the minimum absorption velocity and @xmath7 is likely to arise due to effects of orientation .",
    "for example , a line of sight close to the accretion disk will pass through more x - ray absorbing gas , and the minimum observed uv absorption velocity will be close to zero as the gas outflow is primarily transverse to the line of sight .",
    "the sample of bal  quasars  observed by _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  is steadily growing , and the current x - ray data are now of sufficient quality to investigate these predictions directly . in this paper",
    ", we summarize the insights offered from both exploratory and spectroscopic x - ray surveys of bal  quasars  to the understanding of quasar winds .",
    "given the extreme faintness of bal  quasars  in the soft x - ray regime ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , obtaining detailed spectroscopic information requires a significant commitment of observatory time .",
    "in this situation , only a small fraction of the population will have data of spectroscopic quality , and there is a legitimate danger that the conclusions drawn from such limited , potentially biased samples will not be representative of the population as a whole .",
    "pursuing an alternate strategy of exploratory observations enables much larger numbers of bal  quasars  to be observed with the goal of measuring x - ray flux , hardness ratio , and @xmath7  for each object . the low background and excellent spatial resolution of _ chandra_allow short , exploratory observations of 57  ks to reach sensitive flux limits of @xmath10  in the 0.58.0  kev band @xcite .",
    "we are in the process of compiling the largest exploratory survey to date , with a well - defined sample of bal  quasars  drawn from the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ; * ? ? ?",

    "] indicates what fraction of the full - band ( 0.58.0  kev ) counts are coming from hard band ( 28  kev ) x - rays .",
    "absorbed quasar spectra will have larger values of the hardness ratio as the cross - section for photoelectric absorption in the x - ray band decreases rapidly with increasing energy .",
    "the trend of increasing hardness ratio with decreasing @xmath7illustrated in figure  3 is therefore consistent with the understanding that x - ray faintness arises from intrinsic absorption .",
    "while this result is not new , it supports the idea that @xmath7  can be used in a rough sense to indicate the extent of absorption . following this premise , @xmath7",
    "might be expected to correlate with uv absorption properties such as c  ivabsorption - line equivalent width , as demonstrated by @xcite for their sample of palomar - green quasars . to complement @xcite",
    "we are probing the extreme end of this parameter space with the bal  quasars . in this regime , there are no apparent correlations between @xmath7  and several absorption - line properties for the bal  quasars  , most significantly the minimum velocity of c  iv  absorption shown in figure  3 .",
    "furthermore , the large column densities of absorbing gas implied by values of @xmath7@xmath16 coupled with the blue uv continua of the majority of our sample imply that the x - ray absorbing gas contains little dust , at least as we know it .",
    "this is consistent with the x - ray absorber being located within the dust sublimation radius .",
    "alternatively , the bulk of the x - ray absorption may lie interior to the uv emission region , though this implies even smaller radii for the absorption .",
    "we also confirm the result of @xcite that the bal  quasars  with broad mg  ii  absorption , the lobal  quasars , are notably x - ray weaker than those with only high - ionization bals .",
    "in fact , only one of the lobal  quasars  in our sample was actually detected ( see figure  2 ) . given that lobal  quasars  generally have reddened optical and uv continua , it is unclear whether the extreme x - ray absorption that they suffer is occuring on the small scales inferred for the high - ionization bal  quasars .",
    "however , x - ray variability of the lobal  quasar  mrk  231 suggests that a substantial x - ray absorber is located within @xmath17  cm of the x - ray continuum source @xcite .    .",

    "though exploratory surveys are essential for determining the general x - ray properties of the population as a whole , spectroscopic investigations are also required to obtain more detailed information on the x - ray continuum shape and absorption properties .",
    "@xcite gathered together 8 spectroscopic - quality observations to investigate general trends from these data . in general",
    ", they found that the underlying x - ray continua are consistent with normal radio - quiet quasars , with significant , complex absorption .",
    "possible sources of the observed complexity ( illustrated in figure  4 ) include partial covering of the x - ray continuum , ionized gas , and velocity structure similar to that seen in the uv regime .",
    "furthermore , normalizing the power - law continua above 5  kev to correct for absorption resulted in typical radio - quiet quasar values of @xmath7 .",
    "all of these results are consistent with the @xcite picture .    however , some unexpected results have also arisen . among the most interesting",
    "is the observation of two absorption lines in the spectrum of apm  08279 + 5255 , apparently from highly ionized fe outflowing with speeds of @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite . in",
    "radiatively driven flows , such high terminal velocities occur in gas launched at much smaller radii than the uv bal wind , which has terminal velocities of @xmath21  . in addition ,",
    "when compared with an _ xmm - newton _  observation of this object taken @xmath22  rest - frame days later @xcite , there is a clear indication of variability in the absorber properties .",
    "apm  08279 + 5255  is not unique ; similar absorption lines have also been seen in pg  1115 + 080  ( chartas et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "these results are challenging for models in which the x - ray and uv absorption arise in the same medium and are predicted to have the same velocity structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "significant iron emission has also been observed in some objects including h  1413 + 117  @xcite .    in another unanticipated result , the formerly x - ray brightest bal  quasar  pg  2112 + 059  @xcite exhibited significant variability between the _ asca _  observation of oct 1999 and the _ chandra _  observation of sep 2002 . in the most recent _ chandra _  data , the power - law continuum normalization dropped by a factor of a few while the measured column density of the absorber increased significantly .",
    "notably , concurrent _ hst _  stis data of the c  iv  absorption line showed no large changes from earlier uv observations",
    ". for pg  2112 + 059  at least , evidence for distinct x - ray and uv absorbers is mounting .",
    "in general , x - ray studies are providing support for the family of radiatively driven wind models .",
    "bal  quasars  are generally x - ray weak with values of @xmath7  indicating a significant reduction in observed x - ray flux relative to the uv continuum . when sufficient data are available , the intrinsic x - ray power , corrected for absorption , is typical of normal radio - quiet quasars .",
    "the complexity in the x - ray absorbers is consistent with highly ionized gas as predicted for the shielding gas ; however the ionization state can not be constrained given the current data quality .",
    "though the wind models have had some success , the lack of any apparent correlation between the uv absorption - line and x - ray properties is contrary to the model predictions . while certainly x - ray and uv absorption are found together in the same objects , the connection between the two is not straightforward .",
    "this is perhaps not unexpected given the complexity of the uv bals and potential quasar - to - quasar variations in wind properties .",
    "the assertion of @xcite that the uv and x - ray absorption arise from the same medium is not easily reconciled with the lack of connection between x - ray and uv variability seen in pg  2112 + 059  and the mismatch in x - ray and uv absorption properties seen in apm  08279 + 5255 .",
    "in addition , the large - velocity outflows seen in apm  08279 + 5255 , which imply a much smaller launching radius that for the bal gas , do not fit within the @xcite picture with a narrow range of launching radii for the outflow .",
    "one of the problems for theoretical wind models with small launching radii is the lack of variability in velocity structure in the uv absorption lines on observed - frame timescales of years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the most comprehensive absorption - line variability investigation to date , the 3  yr study of @xcite , was not long enough for a conclusive test ; the hydrodynamic wind models of @xcite generated instabilities on rest - frame timescales of @xmath23  yr . with longer time baselines , velocity increases",
    "have been seen for at least one object @xcite , and an extended study is certainly warranted to investigate this issue further . if the bulk of the x - ray absorbing gas is on smaller scales than the bal gas , it is also possible that x - ray absorption variability on shorter timescales may regularly occur , as seen for pg  2112 + 059  and apm  08279 + 5255 . to make accurate predictions for such events ,",
    "the hydrodynamic models may need to be extended to smaller radii ( @xmath24  cm ) with higher resolution , and also more explicitly include the effects of compton pressure . for highly ionized gas , this will dominate the radiation force ( d. chelouche , priv . comm . ) .",
    "additional items for an x - ray observer s wish list from theoretical modeling are specific predictions for the strength and profiles of fe emission and absorption lines .",
    "an outstanding issue for future investigations concerns the velocity of the x - ray absorbing gas in most bal  quasars ; is it stalled , outflowing , or inflowing ?",
    "@xcite claimed that highly ionized gas should be inflowing or stalled , but the evidence from apm  08279 + 5255  and pg  1115 + 080  suggests otherwise .",
    "an x - ray gratings observation of a bal quasar offers the potential for a qualitative advance in this field .",
    "the improved resolution of gratings data , from @xmath25  for ccd data to @xmath26  , would enable a more penetrating and subtle investigation into the connection between uv and x - ray absorption .",
    "in particular , significant constraints could be placed on the velocity , column density , and ionization state of the x - ray absorbing gas .",
    "these values can then provide information on the location of the x - ray absorber and the mass - outflow rate , parameters of fundamental physical importance .",
