    "in this paper we continue the study of the derivation of a nucleon - nucleon force from the skyrme model . in previous work",
    "@xcite we have shown that the skyrme model gives a good qualitative description of the intermediate and long range nuclear force . here",
    "we study the phaseshifts obtained in the model .",
    "this requires new information about the repulsive core of the potential .",
    "many more details of the problem , as well as some alternative approaches are reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in our previous work",
    "we have discussed all the steps that are necessary to obtain a good result for the @xmath0 force .",
    "the starting assumption is that the skyrme model @xcite , a non - linear field theory of interacting pions , is related to qcd in the limit of a large number of colors ( @xmath2 ) . even though this connection is uncertain",
    ", one can take the point of view that in the long wavelength limit only the lightest degree of freedom , the pion , plays a role .",
    "thus one expects the model to be good for phenomena where only distances larger than the wavelength of the @xmath3 meson , the next lightest particle , play a role .",
    "an interesting property of the skyrme model is that there exists a topologically conserved current , usually associated with the baryon number @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5 solution , the skyrmion or hedgehog , has been used to describe properties of hadrons to better than 30 % @xmath6 , giving numerical support to the model . once we take the skyrme model to be a valid starting point for the discussion of single baryons , the next step is to study the interaction of two baryons . to this end one",
    "studies a collective - coordinate manifold of @xmath7 skyrmion states , which is rich enough to describe the dynamics of @xmath0 states .",
    "initial studies of the @xmath7 system were based on the so - called product ansatz , which is still used as a paradigm for understanding the structure of the manifold ( see the discussion in ref .",
    "this ansatz describes the superposition of two skyrmions without any distortion .",
    "the advantage of this ansatz is that it allows us to construct all states on the collective manifold in terms of a few invariant combination of six parameters .",
    "this in turn can be used to determine the collective potential and kinetic energy on all points of the manifold . to understand why the product ansatz is not good enough for a realistic calculation of the @xmath0 force ,",
    "consider the potential energy in a little more detail .",
    "it is calculated as the difference between the energy of two interacting skyrmions and twice the energy of a single skyrmion .",
    "this number is typically of the order of tens of mev s , but is obtained from the difference of two numbers of the order of @xmath8 .",
    "this is obviously sensitive to relatively minor flaws in the ansatz .",
    "the product ansatz has several flaws , that make it unlikely that it can lead to a correct description of the @xmath7 system .",
    "these are first of all that the product ansatz is not symmetric under interchange of the two hedgehogs , secondly that it can not describe the cylindrically symmetric ground state of the @xmath7 manifold , the donut @xcite .    in order to find improved solutions one can try to find better solutions on part of the collective manifold ( the calculations are too demanding to solve for every state ) . to that end one",
    "picks out those sets of solutions that have a definite reflection symmetry ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the skyrmion configurations are now obtained numerically by imposition of a constraint on the separation of the two solutions , which leads to distorted states , finally culminating in a state of toroidal symmetry , the donut .",
    "this method is based on the assumption that these solutions are stationary against deformations that break the reflection symmetry . from preliminary results of a calculation performing a local rpa on the atiyah - manton ansatz",
    ", this assumption appears to be largely correct @xcite . as stated above the disadvantage of this approach",
    "is that one obtains only partial information about the collective hamiltonian .",
    "fortunately the information one can extract coincides with the dominant part of the interaction as calculated in the product ansatz .    after performing all this analysis , we still end up with a classical collective hamiltonian that describes the large @xmath2 limit , where the nucleon and its excited states are degenerate .",
    "since we believe that the quantum world has @xmath9 we can not requantize the collective hamiltonian as it stands .",
    "instead we requantize the hamiltonian in a space of nucleons and @xmath10 s .",
    "we use an algebraic technique to perform this reduction @xcite .",
    "this leads to a coupled channels problem , and not yet to a @xmath0 force . in a final step we invoked the born - oppenheimer approximation in our previous work to obtain the @xmath0 adiabatic nuclear force , which was shown to be similar to a phenomenological force , such as the reid soft - core potential @xcite .    in this paper we shall study the phaseshifts calculated in the full ( @xmath11 ) case and for the adiabatic reduction",
    "this will give us information about the adiabatic reduction , as well as about the quality of the intermediate coupled channels problem .",
    "we will have to go slightly beyond the adiabatic approximation in order to obtain information about the short - range repulsive core .",
    "this last part of the potential must be included in a calculation of @xmath0 phaseshifts .",
    "tes paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nn ] we study our model for the collective hamiltonian and the reduction to a @xmath0 force . in the next section , sec .",
    "d ( [ sec : phases ] ) , we discuss the phaseshift calculation for the @xmath12 and @xmath13@xmath14 channels . some technical details about the calculations",
    "can be found in the appendix . in sec .",
    "[ sec : delta ] we discuss the possibility of finding resonances near @xmath10 production thresholds . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] , we draw some conclusions .",
    "the skyrme model @xcite is a non - linear field theory that can be realized in terms of an su(2)-valued matrix field @xmath15 , with lagrangian density @xmath16 + \\frac{1}{32g^2}{\\rm tr } [ u^\\dagger\\partial_\\mu u , u^\\dagger\\partial_\\nu u]^2 + \\frac{m_\\pi^2}{4}[{\\rm tr}(u+u^\\dagger)-4].\\ ] ] the model is covariant , as well as invariant under global su(2)-rotations that are identified with the isospin symmetry . as was discovered by skyrme the model",
    "has a topologically conserved quantum number , which is identified as the baryon number @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath15 field is interpreted as a combination of a scalar @xmath17 field and an isovector pion field , @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath17 field is not an independent physical field due to the unitarity constraint on @xmath15 .",
    "the standard time - independent solution to the classical field equations for @xmath5 is the defensive hedgehog , where the pion field points radially outward , @xmath19 the baryon number of this state is given by @xmath20 .",
    "this solution breaks translational invariance , as well as the @xmath21 spin - isospin symmetry .",
    "if we perform a global su(2 ) isorotation on the state , @xmath22 we obtain a state of the same energy .    in the @xmath7 system we will frequently use the product ansatz , which is also used as a model to understand the more complicated numerical solutions .",
    "this ansatz makes use of the fact that the product of two @xmath5 solutions has baryon number two .",
    "the most general ansatz we can construct from two hedgehogs consists of the product of two separated and rotated hedgehogs , @xmath23 in the last line of ( [ eq : pa ] ) we have introduced the matrix @xmath24 , that describes the rigid isorotation of the whole system , as well as a relative isorotation @xmath25 . when @xmath26 is very large changing @xmath25 or @xmath24 does not change the energy of the solution . for smaller @xmath26 , @xmath24 still generates a zero - mode ( corresponding to broken isospin symmetry ) , but the energy will depend on @xmath25 . again , the energy is also invariant under spatial rotation , due to the conservation of angular momentum @xmath27 .",
    "as discussed in our previous work , the introduction of collective coordinates leads to an effective hamiltonian for the relative motion and relative orientation ( we shall use the word relative orientation as a synonym for the relative isorotation ) . in the calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite only a small part of the collective surface was calculated : using reflection symmetries one studies three one - dimensional `` lines '' on the collective manifold where the radial coordinate @xmath26 changes , but the orientation ( analogous to the matrix @xmath25 in the product ansatz ( [ eq : pa ] ) ) remains fixed .",
    "this allows one to extract limited information about the collective hamiltonian , through an expansion in invariants to first order .",
    "fortunately the product ansatz , where the complete expansion can be calculated @xcite , allows one to show that higher order terms are small .",
    "the resulting classical hamiltonian , obtained after making some crude approximations for the kinetic terms , still treats radial motion on the same footing as isorotational motion , which separates the nucleon from the @xmath10 and higher @xmath28 resonances .",
    "as is well known the appearance of unphysical resonances with higher @xmath28 is due to the close relation of the skyrme model with the string theory that describes the large @xmath2 limit of qcd . in order to make progress towards the physical world ,",
    "we need to re - impose the restriction @xmath9 .",
    "the way we proceed ( see @xcite for an alternative but equivalent approach ) is through a requantization of the spin - isospin degrees of freedom of the individual skyrmions using an @xmath29 interacting boson model for those degrees of freedom .",
    "the important step @xcite is to identify the boson number in these models with the number of colors .",
    "the representation space then consist of twenty states : the nucleon and @xmath10 with all possible spin - isospin projections .    the requantized hamiltonian can be given in the following form @xcite , @xmath30 in the potential energy ( the last three terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) ) the functions @xmath31 are taken from the calculation of the interaction energy of two skyrmions .",
    "the operators @xmath32 and @xmath33 are similar to the spin - spin and tensor operators : @xmath34/n_{\\rm c}^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath35 and @xmath36 label two different sets of bosons , used to realize the @xmath37 algebras , and @xmath38 is a one - body operator with spin and isospin @xmath39 . in order to simplify the algebra",
    ", we introduce a spherical tensor notation , which allows for the use of the standard racah calculus .",
    "we then need the spin - isospin doubly reduced matrix elements of ( the spherical tensor form of ) @xmath38 .",
    "these are given by @xmath40    in the kinetic energy we have made the _ approximation _ that the mass is a constant , equal to twice the relevant reduced mass ( so @xmath41 still is an operator in isospace ) .",
    "we assume that both the mass @xmath41 and the moment of inertia @xmath42 are independent of @xmath26 , and that @xmath42 is independent of the orientation  certainly a gross simplification .",
    "some preliminary work has been done on lifting those approximations @xcite , but not enough is known at this instant to make a better approximation .    as in our previous work we extracted the functions @xmath31 from the work in ref .",
    "@xcite . instead of using a table of numbers",
    ", we chose to make a fit to the results .",
    "one reason is that we shall need to push the calculation to short distances .",
    "we choose a form of powers of @xmath43 times exponentials of one- and two - pion range : @xmath44 the relevant parameters are listed in table [ tab : vfit ] .",
    ".parameters in the fit to the potential @xmath31 , as evaluated by .",
    "the unit for @xmath43 is fm , all energies are given in mev .",
    "[ tab : vfit ] [ cols=\"^,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that the repulsive core is not very well determined from the standard calculations @xcite .",
    "this is due in part to the uncertainty in the definition of the coordinate @xmath26 for small separations ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the calculation of an @xmath0 potential from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) can be split into two parts .",
    "one is the adiabatic calculation , valid when the @xmath0 force is weak compared to the total energy of the system ( from a numerical calculation one finds that , roughly , @xmath46 ) . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is based on the separation of energy scales : for large @xmath47 , one can distinguish two energy scales or reciprocally two time scales .",
    "the slower time scale is associated with the motion in the collective manifold , i.e. , @xmath26 and the orientation .",
    "the other time scale corresponds to the almost instantaneous response of the pion field to changes in @xmath26 and the relative isospin orientation . for large @xmath47",
    "we can not separate the time scales for the two sets of adiabatic modes , as can be seen in the highly correlated doughnut . in the donut state orbital modes and isorotational modes",
    "are intrinsically linked , leading to the interesting structure of this state .",
    "for @xmath47 equal to three the situation changes .",
    "the @xmath26 motion is typically much slower than the rotational motion which leads to the separation of the nucleon and @xmath10 states .",
    "we thus have three energy scales , that of the pion field , of the @xmath11 separation and of the @xmath26 motion .",
    "we can now calculate a born - oppenheimer potential for the @xmath26-motion , which constitutes the slowest degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "this adiabatic  born - oppenheimer ",
    "approximation fails at shorter distances ( @xmath48 ) , where the @xmath26 dependent potential becomes strongly repulsive .",
    "numerical experimentation showed that for the calculation of the phaseshifts a _",
    "prescription seems to work well .",
    "the adiabatic potential energy curves exhibit ( relatively ) narrow avoided crossing in the interior region .",
    "if we follow the adiabatic curve in the interior region , we obtain a potential of rather poor quality . if we follow the unmixed curve through the crossing , as if no crossing took place , we obtain much better results .",
    "this corresponds to a diabatic approximation , where we replace avoided crossings by real crossings .",
    "we calculate the phaseshifts by integrating the schrdinger equation from @xmath49 where we impose hard - core boundary conditions ( the forces are so repulsive at short distances , that this is no limitation ) , to @xmath50 where we match to spherical bessel functions describing the asymptotic behavior of the wavefunctions ( this corresponds to the approximation that the potential vanishes beyond this point , but keeps all the slowly decaying centrifugal forces . ) as discussed in the appendix this leads directly to an evaluation for the @xmath51 matrix , which in its turn leads to the phaseshifts .",
    "since we need to impose hard core boundary conditions at @xmath49 , this point had better be inside the repulsive core of the potential .",
    "the choice of this interior radius is studied in fig .  [",
    "fig : match ] , where we show the calculated phaseshift in the @xmath12 channel for center - of - mass energy of 1 mev .",
    "the ordinate shows the radius @xmath52 where we perform the matching , and the abscissa gives the calculated phaseshift .",
    "as can clearly be seen in the upper part of the figure , a hard - core radius of @xmath53 fm gives the wrong phaseshifts .",
    "to be on the safe side , we have always used a radius of @xmath54 fm in our calculations",
    ".    strengthened by the apparent robustness of our method , even close to threshold , we now study the phaseshifts in the @xmath12 channel as a function of the center - of - mass kinetic energy ( the zero of energy is the @xmath0 threshold ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1s0 ] we show the phaseshifts obtained from the full @xmath55 coupled channels problem and compare it to the phaseshifts for the adiabatic @xmath0 potential .",
    "it is important to note how close these results are .",
    "this implies that the adiabatic potential is a good approximation to the underlying more complicated problem . for good measure",
    "we have also added the arndt _",
    "et al _ phenomenological phaseshifts @xcite obtained from the said database for @xmath56 scattering in the same figure .",
    "clearly we do not have enough attraction in this channel , even though the trend is surprisingly good .",
    "actually we can obtain enough attraction by increasing all parameters in the potential function @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vfit ] ) , except @xmath57 , by only 6 % ! ( keeping @xmath57 fixed means that we do not strengthen the most repulsive part of the interaction beyond its current value ; if we increase this parameter we find it hard to obtain agreement . )    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:1s0_s ] , this gives enough attraction near threshold .",
    "the remaining difference between our model potential and the phenomenological phaseshifts is now mainly due to the description of the repulsive core .",
    "this is a part of the skyrme model that we have not yet analyzed .",
    "of course we can perform the same analysis for the @xmath58 channel .",
    "we analyze the two - by - two @xmath51 matrix in terms of the standard stapp parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 as @xcite @xmath61 again the results from the full potential and the adiabatic approximation are very close .",
    "so close that we have not plotted them in fig .",
    "[ fig:3s1 ] .",
    "as can be seen the results compare favorably with the phenomenological analysis , even though we have less attraction . to our surprise",
    ", however , the phase - shift goes to @xmath62 at threshold .",
    "this shows that our potential supports a bound state .",
    "further analysis shows that this occurs very close to threshold , the state is bound by only @xmath63 , reflecting the fact that the attraction in the current channel is too weak .",
    "again , a simple rescaling by 6 % of all parameters but @xmath57 gives a binding energy much closer to experiment , @xmath64 .",
    "if we improved on the calculation of the repulsive core ( which appears to be too strong in the current calculation ) one might even expect better results , since both the phaseshifts and the binding energy of the deuteron are obtained through the delicate balance between attraction and repulsion .",
    "this makes it even more surprising that we obtain results so close to experiment .      to calculate the phaseshifts we express the hamiltonian in a coupled channels matrix form , ( after re - expressing the equations in terms of @xmath74 )",
    "@xmath75 here we require that @xmath76 , and thus the threshold for channel @xmath77 is given by @xmath78 .",
    "the integer @xmath79 is the orbital angular momentum of the given channel in order to solve the scattering problem , we impose hard - core boundary conditions at a small radius @xmath80 .",
    "we also assume that the potentials @xmath81 are negligibly small for a radius @xmath52 , so that we can approximate solutions by free solutions for @xmath43 larger than this value .",
    "we integrate outwards from @xmath80 , given the derivative at this point . for convenience",
    "we introduce @xmath82 .",
    "the differential equation then reads @xmath83 u _",
    "i(r)-v_{ij } u _ j(r)\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we solve this by an explicit method ( i.e. , one that only uses function values at previous values of @xmath43 to determine what happens at the next value ) . if we keep the initial derivative @xmath84 as an explicit parameter , this can be written in matrix form @xmath85 where the matrix @xmath41 depends on the method used ( we use a fourth order runge kutta ) . due to the hard core boundary conditions we thus only need two of the sub - matrices , @xmath86 at this point we match to the spherical bessel functions that describe the asymptotic behavior of the problem , i.e. , the eigenvalues of a hamiltonian consisting only of kinetic terms and centrifugal forces , @xmath87 here the channel momentum @xmath88 , with @xmath89 in the positive half - plane if @xmath90 .",

    "in many of the phaseshift analyses by the vpi group ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) the @xmath38 matrix exhibits a resonance very near the @xmath10 production threshold . as better data became available",
    "some of these poles have disappeared , but currently a few channels still seem to exhibit resonances @xcite .",
    "the abovementioned analysis has not yet been pushed to near the double @xmath10 production region .",
    "this region is of some interest , however .",
    "theoretically it has been argued that strong attraction in the @xmath65 channel is `` inevitable '' @xcite .",
    "recently wang _ et al _ @xcite studied this question using an approach to baryon interactions based on nonrelativistic quark dynamics . using their  quark delocalization \" scheme and color screening",

    "we see that there is indeed an attractive potential in this channel , but that it is no where near the unusually large potential reported by wang _",
    "et al_. in this case our potential is obtained without channel mixing ( since we are studying excited states mixing will actually decrease the binding ) .",
    "if we perform a coupled channels bound - state calculation in the @xmath66 subspace only we find a bound state with a binding energy of about @xmath69 .",
    "we have solved for the nucleon - nucleon phaseshifts below the @xmath66 threshold in the @xmath67 , @xmath70 channel , where the only two open channels are the @xmath0 @xmath24 and @xmath71 waves .",

    "threshold one can make the approximation that the threshold energy is complex , with an imaginary part corresponding to the width of the @xmath10 . using this approximation",
    "we find that the resonance is extremely sensitive to such a change .",

    "in this paper we have shown that the skyrme model can be used to obtain a @xmath0 interaction that is reasonable in terms of the phase shifts it produces .",

    "we can obtain sufficient attraction to get both the deuteron binding energy and the attraction in the @xmath12 channel close to the experimental value .",
    "the weakest point of the potential is actually both the description and the size of the repulsive core .",
