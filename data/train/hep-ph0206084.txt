    "recent neutrino experiment in super - kamiokande @xcite on atmospheric neutrinos has confirmed the @xmath1 oscillation being large mixing , @xmath2 , and found the range of the mass parameter @xmath3 to be @xmath4 .",
    "solar neutrino experiments by the super - kamiokande collaboration @xcite favor the large mixing angle ( lma ) msw solution , although there can be four solutions , the small mixing angle ( sma ) msw solution , the low @xmath5 ( low ) solution and the vacuum ( vac ) solution .",
    "the mass and mixing parameter @xmath6 for lma - msw solution is @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "as we consider the three - flavor neutrinos , we can set @xmath8 to @xmath9 and @xmath10 to @xmath11 , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 . the remaining mixing angle @xmath14 is restricted to @xmath15 by the chooz experiment @xcite .",
    "to answer a question why the neutrino sector mixings expressed by a @xmath0 matrix @xcite are so large in contrast to the small mixings of the quark sector expressed by a @xmath16 matrix is one of the most challenging issues at present .",
    "furthermore , the values of neutrino masses predicted in neutrino oscillation lead to the next question why the neutrino masses are so small compared to other fermion masses . in order to explain the second question , almost authors assume the seesaw mechanism @xcite introducing the heavy right handed majorana neutrinos . for the explanation of first questions , there are two scenarios ; first @xcite is to use the so - called froggatt nielsen mechanism @xcite in order to make the mass hierarchy of lepton masses , and second @xcite to use the democratic mass matrix with small violations in order to make the mass hierarchy of lepton masses .",
    "we call the second type of mass matrix `` universal type mass matrix '' hereafter . in the first scenario ,",
    "the matrix elements except 33 element of mass matrix are suppressed by the powers of spontaneous breaking of some family symmetry .",
    "then , we call the first type of mass matrix `` family symmetry dependent type mass matrix '' .",
    "if one assumes a standpoint of grand unified theory ( gut ) , the mass matrices of quarks and charged leptons should be the same type .",
    "mass matrix for dirac neutrino in models should have the same type of quark and charged lepton mass matrix .",
    "furthermore , it is natural to assume that the mass matrix of the majorana neutrino is the same type of mass matrix for other dirac fermion . in scenarios assuming the family symmetry dependent type mass matrix",
    ", a few models @xcite adopt the mass matrix of the majorana neutrino similar to the type of mass matrix for other dirac fermions . in models assuming the universal type mass matrix , literature @xcite adopts the mass matrix for the majorana neutrino similar to the type of mass matrix for other dirac fermion .",
    "works in refs .",
    "@xcite use the universal yukawa coupling ( democratic mass matrix ) with small violations for dirac neutrino and also for majorana neutrino , and discuss the possibility producing the neutrino large mixing through the seesaw mechanism .",
    "we call this possibility `` neutrino large mixing induced through seesaw mechanism '' . neutrino mixing matrix @xmath0",
    "is given by a product of an unitary matrix @xmath17 diagonalizing the charged lepton mass and a unitary matrix @xmath18 diagonalizing the effective neutrino mass @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the dirac neutrino and the majorana neutrino mass matrix , respectively .",
    "the charged lepton mass matrix is the democratic mass matrix @xmath22 in the limit neglecting small violations , and this mass matrix is diagonalized by the unitary matrix @xmath23 in the limit neglecting small violations . for the neutrino masses",
    ", the effective neutrino mass @xmath24 is produced through the seesaw mechanism as @xmath25 . though these neutrino mass matrices @xmath20 and @xmath21 are democratic type mass matrices , the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath24 could be almost diagonal if the small violations in @xmath21 satisfy a certain condition as discussed in section iii . if the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath24 is almost diagonal , the transforming matrix @xmath18 for the neutrino is close to the unit matrix",
    ". then the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath0 satisfies @xmath26 , and large neutrino mixing is realized .",
    "in the universal yukawa coupling scenario , the main mass hierarchy is produced by the universality of the yukawa coupling ( democratic mass matrix @xcite ) , and another mass hierarchy is produced by small violations added to the democratic mass matrix .",
    "this violation is considered to be just like the @xmath27 violation in the hadron spectroscopy and hadron decay processes .",
    "this @xmath27 violation is considered to be produced by the quark mass difference ( violation from the @xmath27 symmetry ) and quark dynamics .",
    "similarly , the violations added to the democratic mass matrix are considered to be produced by some violation from a horizontal symmetry and some dynamics of the quarks and leptons . because the origin of the violation is not clear at present , we treat these small violations as free parameters .",
    "we assume the following mass matrices for charged leptons and dirac neutrinos ; @xmath28 this violation pattern is similar to that of the quark sector(neglecting the phases ) @xcite , @xmath29 these mass matrices are diagonalized by a unitary matrix @xmath30 close to @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath32 eigenvalues are obtained as @xmath33\\gamma\\approx \\delta_1\\gamma ,        \\nonumber\\\\ & & m_2\\approx \\left[\\frac13(\\delta_1+\\delta_2+\\delta_3)+\\frac13        \\xi\\right]\\gamma\\approx\\frac23(\\delta_2+\\delta_3)\\gamma,\\\\ & & m_3\\approx \\left[3-\\frac23(\\delta_1+\\delta_2+\\delta_3 )        \\right]\\gamma\\approx3\\gamma,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34^{1/2}.\\ ] ] in the same democratic mass matrix scenario , branco et al .",
    "@xcite assumed the following pattern of violations for charged leptons @xmath35 and dirac neutrinos @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37    for neutrino masses , we use the seesaw mechanism .",
    "then the effective left - handed neutrino masses are given as @xmath38 using the right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath39 .",
    "for this majorana neutrino mass matrix , we assume the following democratic mass matrix with small violations in all matrix elements except for 33 element @xmath40 adding breaking terms to the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) elements in order to keep the generality .",
    "this pattern of violation is most general form on the left - right symmetry scenario .",

    "@xmath42    the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is diagonalized by the unitary matrix @xmath44 close to @xmath31 in eq .",

    "main purpose of this work is to show that one can obtain the allowed values of violation parameters satisfying the condition that the unitary matrix @xmath46 diagonalizing the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath53 becomes nearly unit matrix .",

    "thus , if the smallness of the small violation parameters @xmath66 or @xmath67 and @xmath73 or @xmath74 are same order , the first term is dominant over other terms . in this case , @xmath24 is close on the democratic type mass matrix , and then @xmath46 is close on @xmath31 and @xmath0 can not give the large mixing .",
    "however , if small violation parameters @xmath73 and @xmath66 or @xmath75 and @xmath76 are satisfy the relation @xmath77 the second term is dominant over other terms . in this case",
    ", @xmath24 can be apart from the democratic mass matrix and can produce the unitary matrix diagonalizing the @xmath24 close to the unit matrix .",
    "thus we can induce the neutrino bi - maximal mixing through the seesaw mechanism adopting the violation parameters satisfying eq .",
