    "the mk classification of stellar spectra ( morgan , keenan & kellman 1943 ) has been an important tool in the workshop of stellar and galactic astronomers for more than a century .",
    "while improvements in astrophysical hardware have enabled the rapid observation of digital spectra , our ability to efficiently analyze and classify spectra has not kept pace .",
    "traditional visual classification methods are clearly not feasible for large spectral surveys . in response to this , we have been working on a project to develop automated spectral classifiers ( von hippel et  al .  1994 ; bailer - jones 1996 ;",
    "bailer - jones et  al.1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "these classifiers , which are based on supervised artificial neural networks , can rapidly classify large numbers of digital spectra .",
    "the development of these classification techniques has required a large , representative set of previously classified spectra .",
    "the most suitable data has been the spectra from the michigan spectral survey ( houk 1994 ) and the accompanying mk spectral type and luminosity class classifications listed in the _ michigan henry draper _ ( mhd ) catalogue ( houk & cowley 1975 ; houk 1978 , 1982 ; houk & smith - moore 1988 ) .",
    "this paper describes the data reduction techniques we developed to extract and process these spectra .",
    "the michigan spectral survey was an objective prism survey of the whole southern sky ( @xmath4 ) from the curtis schmidt telescope at the cerro tololo interamerican observatory in chile .",
    "we scanned a number of the plates from this survey using the apm facility in cambridge ( kibblewhite et  al .",
    "this machine uses a flying - spot laser and photomultiplier detector to digitize areas of the plate .",
    "the usual mode of use for prism plates is to locate objects using their known co - ordinates and then to scan just the region of interest , either by recording all of the pixels or by parametrizing the object in real time ( e.g.hewett et  al .  1985 ) .",
    "the coordinates are often obtained from a direct image of the same field taken on the same telescope .",
    "other groups have also developed methods for the automated and semi - automated extraction of prism spectra ( e.g.  clowes , cooke & beard 1984 ; flynn & morrison 1990 ; hagen et al .",
    "1995 ; wisotzki et al .",
    "1996 ) often with the goal of identifying quasar spectra .",
    "our approach differs from the conventional method in the principal respect that we used the apm in raster scanning mode to digitize the entire plate .",
    "subsequent plate reduction and extraction of the spectra take place off - line .",
    "the main reason for this approach is that it can equally well be applied to ccd objective prism images , which are increasingly replacing photographic plates .",
    "furthermore , additional spectra can later be extracted very rapidly without requiring access to a plate scanning machine .",
    "tests determined that the optimal scanning resolution was 15 , which corresponds to 1.45  per pixel .",
    "while the site seeing is typically better , the telescope has relatively poor tracking ability , and this led to an effectively lower seeing ( blurring ) .",
    "table  [ plt_det ] gives details of the plates and the reduced spectra .",
    "figure  [ plate ] shows a typical plate .",

    "continuum fits at the redder ends of late - type stars are always poor : the presence of many molecular bands makes the definition of a ` continuum ' rather meaningless , so we can only remove low frequency variations .",
    "the main concern of continuum removal should be to extract a continuum to ` first order ' in a _ consistent _ way , so as to remove that continuum information which is not intrinsic to the stellar spectrum , such as that produced by instrumental effects .",
    "provided this condition is met , the exact shape of the continuum which is subtracted is not that important .",
    "this is demonstrated by the quality of the classifications we achieve with the reduced spectra ( bailer - jones et  al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "a combination of masked median filtering and linear filtering generally gives better continuum fits than fourier methods .",
    "any fourier continuum estimation method which involves filtering out the high frequency components of the power spectrum is equivalent to ` blurring ' the original spectrum by convolving it ( in the wavelength space ) with a broad bell - shaped function . as such",
    ", the continuum will always be distorted by the presence of broad lines or rapid changes in the original continuum .",
    "this convolution is a linear operation , which is why fourier methods are limited in the type of continua they give .",
    "median filtering , on the other hand , is a non - linear operation and can therefore produce a better fit to the continuum . when followed up with a linear filter ( boxcar ) ,",
    "a smooth continuum is obtained .",
    "the combined median / boxcar filter is also robust and consistent , in the sense that it is not sensitive to data ` spikes ' ( unlike linear methods ) and thus will give similar continua for similar spectral types even in the presence of bogus spectral features .",
    "this paper has described a method for extracting spectra from objective prism images .",
    "the method has been developed for the reduction of a set of photographic objective prism plates , but because the spectral extraction and processing takes place entirely in software using the complete digitized plate , it can equally well be applied to ccd objective prism images .",
    "the extraction process is driven by a set of catalogue right ascension and declination positions , so a direct image of each field is not required .",
    "after an initial interactive period taking one or two minutes , the subsequent reduction is automatic , taking approximately one hour on a modest - sized sun sparc ipx to process a single plate ( i.e.  extract about 150 spectra ) .",
    "the reduction method described in this paper has been used to extract a set of over 12,000 high - quality spectra . from this , a subset of over 5,000 normal spectra was selected which had reliable two - dimensional ( spectral type and luminosity class ) classifications listed in the mhd catalogue .",
    "the frequency distribution of the various stellar classes in this set is shown in figure  [ dist_b ] .",
    "this data set is used in accompanying papers to produce automated systems for classifying and physically parametrizing stellar spectra ( bailer - jones et  al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ) .    in the interests of extending spectral classification to more distant stellar populations , spectra of stars fainter than b @xmath5 are required .",
    "this could be achieved with a ccd objective prism survey .",
    "although the technique described can only extract objects with known right ascension and declination coordinates , the hst guide star catalogue ( e.g.  lasker et al .  1990 ) , which lists 19 million objects brighter than 16@xmath6 magnitude , could be used as a driver for extraction .",
    "however , bailer - jones ( unpublished , 1996 ) has also modified the method to extract unwidened spectra from ccd objective prism images in the absence of any coordinates , using an algorithm to locate local flux peaks .",
    "the method can be applied to spectra at different spectral resolutions and wavelength coverages , provided a suitable line exists for the second plate solution .",
