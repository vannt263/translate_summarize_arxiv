    "resonant tunnelling was first observed in scattering of electrons by noble gases where it is known as the ramsauer effect@xcite .",
    "after the invention of quantum mechanics , the appearance of the scattering minimum at a particular electron energy was explained by coupling with a quasi - bound state of the gas atom . following the pioneering work of esaki and tsu@xcite in the seventies , the same effect was found in resonant tunnelling structures@xcite(rtss ) where the role of electrostatic potential barriers is played by thin semiconductor layers .",
    "rts is the basic nanoelectronic device that exploits the quantum nature of electrons . as the electron transport through a rts is a combination of coherent tunnelling and phase - breaking collisions , rtss are the ideal testing ground for quantum transport theories . in the envisioned high - performance electronic applications ,",
    "one aims to maximize the main current peak where coherent transport dominates while minimizing the satellite peaks that occur due to scattering .",
    "resonances appear in scattering as well because it is enhanced for the localized quasi - bound states , the most pronounced feature being the longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonon satellite peak@xcite .",
    "while leading to performance degradation and power dissipation , the scattering mechanisms in rtss are interesting in themselves for allowing the study of various aspects of the twodimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) physics via current spectroscopy .",
    "when a perpendicular magnetic field is applied , the 2deg density of states ( dos ) collapses into discrete landau levels ( lls ) thus pronouncing the resonant features in scattering . for this reason , magnetotunnelling experiments in rtss @xcite have been established as an important tool in investigating the 2deg physics .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction within the 2deg of iii - v rtss leads to a formation of magnetopolarons@xcite manifested as a characteristic anticrossing of lls which has been observed in magnetotunnelling experiments@xcite .",
    "another important phenomenon in inas - based rtss is the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) . due to potential applications in semiconductor spintronics@xcite , the zero - magnetic field spin splitting in a 2deg",
    "has been receiving considerable attention since the field effect spin transistor was proposed by datta and das@xcite . at smaller magnetic fields",
    "soi is known to significantly affect the 2deg lls leading to a beating pattern in the dos .",
    "this causes a beating pattern in magnetoresistivity which is often used to characterize soi in a 2deg@xcite .",
    "here we report on a theoretical study of magnetotunnelling with lo phonon and interface roughness ( ir ) scattering taking a particular care of the carrier spin .",
    "the spin splitting is described as a combination of soi and the zeeman effect , both of which are known to be pronounced in inas quantum wells .",
    "a detailed description is given of a nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) model@xcite with scattering treated within the self - consistent first born approximation ( fba ) .",
    "the lo phonon and ir correlation functions are approximated with delta functions , the suitability of which is discussed in appendices [ sec_ir_corr_funcs ] and [ sec_lo_corr_funcs ] .",
    "the model is applied to a symmetrical inas - gaas double barrier rts and shown to yield i - v curves that qualitatively match the experimental data .",

    "a generalized multiband efa allows for many parameters and is applicable for modelling a wide range of semiconductor heterostructures @xcite . the one - band approximation used here",
    "is often adopted for single - valley conduction band heterostructure states .",
    "this is because up to few hundred milielectron volts above the conduction band minimum , the states are of a dominantly s - like character so both energy dispersion and matrix elements can be sufficiently well estimated using effective parameters .",
    "the use of more complicated models such as the multiband efa or , especially with negf calculations , multiband empirical tight - binding models @xcite is justified when a more quantitative model@xcite is aimed for or even mandatory if effects like inter - valley scattering or inter - band tunnelling are studied .",
