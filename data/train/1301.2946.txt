    "the light curve of v65 is unstable ( see figure [ fig : v65all ] ) .",
    "the fast rotation of the components , implied by the relatively short orbital period of 2.29  d , apparently induces a strong magnetic activity in at least one of the stars .",
    "a clear sign of such an activity is the x - ray emission : the system was listed by @xcite as the x - ray source cx 30 with @xmath15  erg  s@xmath16 . for the present analysis , we selected observations collected between 2008 june 07 and 2009 june 30 . during that period",
    "the light curve was flat between the eclipses , the eclipses were symmetric ( note the totality of the secondary eclipse ) , and the binary was brighter than in the other observing seasons .",
    "all these observations indicate that the magnetic activity of the system was significantly lower than during the other observing seasons .",
    "the remaining two light curves are stable .",
    "while the eclipses of the star v66 are symmetric and separated by a half of the orbital period , the orbit of v69 is clearly eccentric , and the secondary eclipse occurs at phase 0.609 .",
    "the final light curves adopted for the analysis of the three systems are shown in figure [ fig:3lc ] .",
    "the spectra were taken with the mike echelle spectrograph @xcite on the magellan baade and clay 6.5-m telescopes , using a 0.7  slit , which provided a resolution r  @xmath1740,000 . a typical observation consisted of two 1800-second exposures of the target , flanking an exposure of a thorium - argon hollow - cathode lamp",
    "a few of the exposures were shorter , depending on the observing conditions .",
    "the raw spectra were reduced with the pipeline software written by dan kelson , following the approach outlined in @xcite .",
    "the iraf package echelle was used for the post - extraction processing .",

    "the results of the velocity measurements are insensitive to minor changes in these parameters .",
    "the templates were gaussian - smoothed to match the resolution of the observed spectra . in the case of v65 , a rotational broadening was additionally applied .    for both v66 and v69 ,",
    "the cross - correlations with template spectra were performed independently on wavelength intervals 4120 - 4320   and 4350 - 4600  , covering the region of the mike blue spectra with the best signal - to - noise ratio while avoiding the h  @xmath21 line .",
    "the final velocities adopted for the analysis were obtained by averaging the results of these two measurements . in the case of v65 ,",
    "the spectrum was contaminated by one of the stars blended with the target ( i d 13374 in table [ and_phot ] ) , so that a three - dimensional extension of the original todcor algorithm @xcite had to be used .",
    "the cross - correlation was performed on the interval 4000 - 4840    to maximize the signal from the very faint secondary component .",
    "the second contaminating star ( i d 13362 in table [ and_phot ] ) , which is fainter and more distant on the sky from the target , was not detected in the velocity cross correlation functions .",

    "the observed velocity curves were fit with a nonlinear least squares solution , using code kindly made available by guillermo torres .",

    "the fits adopted the periods and times of primary eclipse as given in equations ( 1 ) .",
    "the analysis of the light curves was performed with the phoebe implementation @xcite of the wilson - devinney ( wd ) model @xcite .",

    "the eccentricity and argument of periastron for v69 were found from the velocity curve .",
    "we obtained a preliminary photometric solution in which they were allowed to vary , but since they changed by only 10% of the errors given in table [ orb_parm ] , we decided to keep them constant during proper iterations .",
    "the residuals of the fits are shown in figure [ fig : all_vars_res ] and the final values of the iterated parameters are given in table [ phot_parm ] .",
    "we checked that the luminosity ratios and relative radii of the components were practically insensitive to changes in effective temperature of the primary : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , all changed by less than 0.3% for a @xmath2150 k change in @xmath25 .",
    "the standard errors of the six parameters iterated upon by phoebe were found using a monte carlo procedure written in the phoebe - scripter , and similar to that outlined in the description of the jktebop code ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "briefly , the procedure replaces the observed light curves @xmath41 and @xmath42 with the fitted ones @xmath43 and @xmath44 , generates gaussian perturbations @xmath45 and @xmath46 such that the standard deviation of the perturbation is equal to the standard deviation of the corresponding residuals shown in figure  [ fig : all_vars_res ] , and performs phoebe iterations on @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    "this cmd shows data for a 3.5@xmath113.5 arcmin@xmath10 field whose center is located 1.4 arcmin from the center of the cluster .",
    "this field was chosen because it shows relatively uniform extinction .",
    "the photometry of all stars in figure [ fig : cmd ] ( including the three debs ) has been corrected for differential reddening ( kaluzny et al .",

    "no attempt was made to remove nonmembers of m4 .",
    "upon averaging the subtracted images on a seasonal basis , we found no evidence of bipolar residuals at the positions of our targets .",
    "such residuals are observed for objects with noticeable proper motions with respect to the surrounding stellar field @xcite .",
    "given the time base and the pixel scale of our images , we rule out motions in excess of 10 mas / y .",
    "since on the proper - motion diagram of m4 most of the field stars are separated from the cluster population by more than 15 mas / y @xcite , this is consistent with all the three targets being members  of  m4 .",
    "the radial velocity of m4 is equal to 70.29@xmath20.07 km s@xmath16 @xcite , while the velocity dispersion is 3.5@xmath20.3 km s@xmath16 at the core , dropping marginally towards the outskirts @xcite .",

    "the velocity of v66 is @xmath492@xmath50 larger than the cluster mean , but the difference is too small to exclude membership .",
    "an additional argument in favor of cluster membership is the location of all of the components of the three debs on or very close to the main sequence of the cluster ( see figure [ fig : cmd ] ) .",

    "* ) ; however to achieve this consistency it was necessary to replace the standard value of the ratio @xmath51 with a significantly larger one ( @xmath52 ; * ? ? ?",
    "a thorough recent study of the reddening law in the field of m4 @xcite indicates that , due to the intervening scorpius - ophiuchus dark clouds , the appropriate value is @xmath53 .",
    "their estimate of the distance to the cluster , obtained from fitting of the zahb @xmath9-band magnitude to models , is 1.80@xmath54 kpc .",
    "following @xcite , we adopted @xmath55 , and corrected the observed magnitudes for extinction using the @xmath27 values from table [ bv ] . to obtain absolute magnitudes in the @xmath9-band we used bolometric luminosities from table [ abs_parm ] , @xmath56 @xcite , and theoretical bolometric corrections obtained from models described in section  [ sect : age ] .",
    "having the corrected observed magnitudes and absolute magnitudes , we derived distance moduli separately for each component of our three debs .",
    "the moduli are listed in table [ abs_parm ] together with their errors which arise from uncertainties of apparent magnitudes from table [ phot_parm ] , reddening from table [ bv ] , @xmath57 from @xcite , and @xmath58 from @xcite . for reasons discussed in section  [",
    "sect : age ] , the effective temperatures of v65 components may be biased , resulting in luminosity errors that are hard to account for .",
    "thus , in principle , the distance calculated from v66 and v69 only should be more reliable than with v65 included . with this restriction",
    ", we obtain a weighted mean distance ( the weights being equal to inverse errors squared ) of 1.82@xmath59 kpc  in excellent agreement with the recent estimate of @xcite .",
    "we note that when @xmath60 is used , the distance increases to 1.95 kpc , in disagreement with other estimates .",
    "thus , our results provide an independent confirmation of the atypical reddening law in the field of m4 . using all six moduli from table [ abs_parm ]",
    "one gets 1.85@xmath61 kpc  a value compatible with that derived from v66 and v69 alone .",
    "the fundamental parameters derived from the binary systems reported in this paper allow us to derive the ages of the individual stars , as well as an aggregate age for the cluster , using theoretical isochrones .",
    "however , before the model comparison is performed it is necessary to review the information available on the chemical composition of m4 since the model - based ages are sensitive to the adopted values of helium abundance , [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath6/fe ] .",
    "the proximity of m4 has made it a frequent subject of spectroscopic investigations . as summarized by @xcite , [ fe / h ] determinations based on high resolution abundance",

    "we adopt a fiducial composition of [ fe / h]=@xmath74 , [ @xmath6/fe]=+0.4 and y=0.25 , but will consider a range of these parameters while deriving the ages of the binary system components .",
    "for the following age analysis , we use two sets of theoretical isochrones that are representative of the state of the art for low - mass , metal - poor stars : dartmouth ( * ? ? ? * henceforth dsed ) and victoria - regina ( * ? ? ? * henceforth vr ) .",
    "a comparison of the derived stellar parameters with 10 , 11 , 12 , and 13 gyr dsed and vr isochrones obtained for the fiducial composition is shown in figure  [ fig : iso ] in the ( @xmath75-@xmath76 ) and ( @xmath75-@xmath77 ) planes .",
    "while the two sets of models are qualitatively similar , the quantitative differences between them lead to differences in derived ages",
    ". however , such differences are smaller than the uncertainties imposed by the observational errors .",
    "it is immediately clear from figure [ fig : iso ] that the lowest - mass star , i.e. the secondary of v65 , is larger in radius than either set of isochrones predicts , but that its luminosity is consistent with an ( essentially ) unevolved main sequence star .",
    "this finding is in qualitative agreement with the results discussed in section  [ sect : intro ] for nearby field binaries with similar masses , and is not unexpected given the dynamical and x - ray properties of v65 ( see section [ sect : lccal ] ) .",
    "the next point to notice is that the primaries of v66 and v69 yield age estimates that are consistent with each other in both planes .",
    "the secondaries in these systems appear to favor older ages , though not at a statistically significant level , particularly in the ( @xmath75-@xmath77 ) plane .",
    "this may be a consequence of the anticorrelation of the radii in v66 and v69 illustrated in figure [ fig:3err ] : an overestimate of the secondary s radius implies an underestimate of the primary s one . if that is the case , then the age discrepancy should more - or - less cancel out when the average age of each system is considered .    in order to formally incorporate the observational uncertainties into the age analysis",
    ", we evaluate the age of each star on a dense grid of points within that star s 3-@xmath50 error box@xmath78a 3-@xmath50 error box represents the best compromise between fully sampling the ( assumed normal ) age distribution and remaining within the parameter space covered by the isochrone grids . ] in both the mass - radius and mass - luminosity planes .",
    "each point at which the age is determined has a weight @xmath79 where @xmath80 represents the distance of a point from the best value in ( @xmath75-@xmath76 ) or ( @xmath75-@xmath77 ) plane in units of the standard deviation derived from the observations .",

    ", the mean and standard deviations derived from the distributions are summarized for all stars in table [ ages ] . as already remarked , the dsed and vr isochrones give ages that agree to within one standard deviation in every case .",
    "further age uncertainties are caused by sensitivity to chemical composition and inherent uncertainties in the stellar evolution model physics ( a @xmath493% effect , see * ? ? ?",
    "we analyze the sensitivity to chemical composition in the ( @xmath75-@xmath76 ) plane only because these quantities do not depend on the adopted composition , whereas the luminosity depends on the composition via the effective temperature .",
    "we calculate age differences ( @xmath82-age ) with respect to the age derived assuming the fiducial composition .",
    "a positive @xmath82-age value indicates that the model with varied composition yields an older age than the model with the fiducial composition .",
    "the numbers presented in table [ agecomp ] are averaged over the components of v66 and v69 ; there is a slight sensitivity of @xmath82-age to stellar mass but it is less than 0.1 gyr .",
    "increasing y _ decreases _ the age derived from the ( @xmath75-@xmath76 ) plane while increasing [ fe / h ] _ increases _ the age . increasing the [ @xmath6/fe ]",
    "ratio also increases the derived age , but the amount varies because of the way that @xmath6-enhancement is defined in each set of models .",
    "the dartmouth models use a constant enhancement of the @xmath6-capture elements whereas the victoria - regina models employ an observationally - motivated enhancement ( the  gsc  heavy element mixture , see * ? ? ?",
    "the age difference between scaled - solar ( [ @xmath6/fe]=0 ) and the @xmath6-enhanced mixture depends in detail on the amount to which certain elements ( most notably o ) are enhanced , see @xcite for a thorough discussion .",
    "@xcite discussed the insights that may be gained by comparing stellar ages derived from fitting the mass - radius relation of the binary v69 in 47 tuc @xcite with those derived from fitting isochrones to the cluster cmd .",
    "in particular , those authors showed that the while the mass - radius diagram is sensitive to all aspects of the composition considered above , the cmd is largely insensitive to variations in y. furthermore , they found that the mass - radius and cmd ages respond differently to changes in [ fe / h ] : while age and [ fe / h ] are correlated in the ( @xmath75-@xmath76 ) or ( @xmath75-@xmath77 ) diagram , they are anticorrelated in the cmd .",
    "it is therefore of some value to consider the implications of the age analysis presented in this section to the comparison of isochrones with the cmd of m4 .",
    "figure [ fig : isocmd ] plots the dartmouth models with the fiducial composition and ages of 10 , 11 , 12 , and 13  gyr ( the same as shown in figure [ fig : iso ] ) . to adjust the isochrones to the observed cmd",
    ", we adopted a true distance modulus of 11.34 ( this is the weighted mean from six moduli listed in table  [ abs_parm ] ) , @xmath83=1.47 and @xmath27=0.39 .",
    "@xmath83 is the product of e@xmath26 and @xmath55 taken from @xcite , while @xmath27 itself is taken from kaluzny et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , who derived it for a reference region with uniform reddening , in which all stars shown in figures [ fig : cmd ] and [ fig : isocmd ] reside .",
    "this derivation is based on two independent sets of observations from 2002 and 2003 .",
    "for each season they selected the best photometric night , during which over 50 measurements of landolt standards were made .",
    "the agreement with @xmath9-band magnitudes of m4 stars published by ( * ? ? ? * cadc online edition ) was excellent , however the measured @xmath26 was on the average 0.023 mag larger than that of stetson ( 0.018 mag and 0.028 mag , respectively , for the 2002 and 2003 seasons ) , causing an analogous increase in the derived @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite obtained a slightly lower reddening of 0.37 mag . while small differences in the photometric calibration or in the areas selected for the analysis can easily account for this discrepancy , the latter value is inconsistent with the overall agreement shown in figure  [ fig : isocmd ] .",
    "the isochrone comparison shown in figure  [ fig : isocmd ] is consistent with an age @xmath84 gyr , higher than derived from the binaries .",
    "we further discuss the age derived for m4 in section [ sect : discus ] .",
    "we define the aggregate age of m4 as an average of the ages of four stars forming v66 and v69 systems .",
    "we calculated two averages .",
    "the first is a standard weighted one , including data from fits in both the ( @xmath75-@xmath76 ) and ( @xmath75-@xmath77 ) planes .",
    "it is equal to 11.10@xmath20.26 and 11.23@xmath20.27 gyr , respectively , for dsed and vr isochrones .",
    "the second average is obtained from ( @xmath75-@xmath76 ) fits only , and in two steps . in the first step the mean age of each system",
    "is found by averaging the ages of the components ( as explained above , this procedure removes effects resulting from the anticorrelation of the stellar radii ) . in the second step ,",
    "a weighted average of the ages of the two systems is calculated , with the weights equal to inverse errors squared . for dsed and vr isochrones this procedure yields 11.25@xmath20.42 and 11.30@xmath20.44 gyr , respectively , i.e. values",
    "entirely compatible with those obtained with the first method .",
    "the final ( and conservative ) age estimate is given by the largest range of ages resulting from the both methods : we may say that m4 is older than 10.8 gyr , but younger than 11.7 gyr , with the most probable age between 11.2 and 11.3 gyr .",
    "following @xcite , and accounting for the age sensitivities listed in table 14 , we adopt a systematic error of 0.85 gyr arising from a 0.1 dex uncertainty in each of [ fe / h ] and [ alpha / fe ] . based on dsed isochrones ,",
    "our formal age estimate for m4 derived from the study of the binary stars v66 and",
    "v69 is 11.25 @xmath20.42 @xmath20.85 gyr .",
    "we note parenthetically that the he abundance of m4 of y = 0.29 + /-0.01 measured by villanova et al .",
    "( 2012 ) in six blue hb stars implies an age of approximately 8 gyr ( see table 14 ) .",
    "a second burst of star formation occurring after a such a long delay seems very unlikely .",
    "we have derived absolute parameters of the components of v65 , v66 and v69 - three detached eclipsing binaries located on the main sequence of the globular cluster m4 .",
    "the accuracy of our mass and radii measurements is better than 1.5% for v65 , and better than 1% for the remaining two debs .",
    "the reason for the lower accuracy of the parameters of v65 is the high activity of this system which causes its light curve to be strongly variable ( see figure [ fig : v65all ] ) .",
    "v65 is a fast rotating , x - ray active binary whose components are most probably puffed - up due to the presence of starspots and/or magnetic fields , as it is often observed in short - period binaries of spectral type k and m ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these properties , while interesting by themselves , make this object unsuitable for analyzes based on isochrone fitting .",
    "we note that chromospherically active components of eclipsing binaries appear to be larger and cooler than inactive single stars of the same mass , but they have a similar luminosity @xcite .",
    "this naturally explains why the primary of v65 is ( and the secondary may be ) located to the red of the main sequence of the cluster .",
    "based on the parameters of the remaining two systems and two sets of theoretical isochrones obtained for y=0.25 , [ fe / h]=@xmath74 and [ @xmath6/fe]=@xmath85 , we set lower and upper limit of the age of m4 at 10.8 and 11.7  gyr with a formal value of 11.25@xmath20.42 ( statistical ) @xmath20.85 ( systematic ) gyr .",
    "the isochrone comparison shown in figure  [ fig : isocmd ] is consistent with an age @xmath4912 gyr .",
    "an age in excess of 12 gyr has also been derived for m4 by @xcite ( from fitting of the white dwarf cooling sequence ; 12.1 gyr ) , @xcite ( from cmd fitting based on acs data ; 12.5 gyr ) and @xcite ( from cmd fitting based on ntt / sofi data ; 12 gyr for [ fe / h]=@xmath63  for a lower metallicity their age would be older ) .",
    "the data listed in table [ tab : agsen ] suggest that this `` cmd - deb discrepancy '' might be removed by a slight increase in [ fe / h ] suggested by the spectroscopic measurements of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it could also be removed by adopting modest variations in the fiducial helium content , [ @xmath6/fe ] , or a combination of all three effects .",
    "we feel , however , that the accuracy of the observational data is still too low , and inherent uncertainties in the theory of stellar evolution are still too high , to turn such suggestions into firm statements concerning the chemical composition of m4 .",
    "the first of these two factors is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] and [ fig : isocmd ] by the scatter of points which define the main sequence of the cluster , and the second - by the sensitivity of stellar evolution codes to details of the chemical composition ( see table  [ tab : agsen ] ; further discussion of this issue can be found in * ? ? ?",
    "formally , considering the statistical and systematic errors , there is no disagreement between the two age estimates .",
    "we note here that @xcite found a similar result for the deb v69 in 47 tuc , where the age derived from the properties of the component stars is @xmath491  gyr younger than the age derived from the location of the main - sequence turnoff ( see their figure 1 ) .",
    "milone et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have used hst photometry to identify multiple main sequences in the cmd of 47 tuc , concluding that approximately 60% of the cluster population is in the form of stars with he and n enrichment .",
    "if the ground - based photometry averages out these small color differences on the main sequence , then it is difficult to explain the discrepancy in ages between the cmd fitting and the age derived from 47  tuc - v69 as stellar he enrichment since the binary appears younger rather than older than the mean population , which is already apparently enhanced in he . in the case of m4 , @xcite and @xcite have also found evidence for two populations within the cluster , mainly based on the abundances of na and cn .",
    "however there is no structure on the main sequence of the cmd that might indicate a he abundance spread .",
    "it is not clear how the abundance distributions of the two populations might influence age determination through the properties of stellar tracks calculated with the different abundances , and we are left with no clear explanation of the measured age difference other than assumptions about the chemical composition that define the fiducial models used in the age measurement .    how might the accuracy of the observational data be increased ? given the large inclinations , the errors in the masses of the components of v66 and v69 originate almost entirely from the orbital solution , which may only be improved by taking additional spectra ( preferably with the same instrument ) .",
    "this , however , would require a large observational effort , as doubling of the present set of radial velocity measurements would lead to an improvement of only 33% in the mass estimates @xcite .",
    "contributions to the errors in the radii of the components are dominated by the photometric solution , whose accuracy , in turn , depends on the errors of the differential photometry .",
    "the latter originate mainly from a marginally sampled psf and limited time - resolution , dictated by the diameter of the telescopes we used , and the sensitivity of available detectors .",
    "we estimate that photometry accurate to 0.002 - 0.003 mag in @xmath9 would reduce the errors of the radii by 50% .",
    "such an improvement is entirely viable , as both v66 and v69 reside in relatively sparsely populated areas , and are not blended with another stars ( see figure [ fig : charts ] ) .",
    "this goal could be easily achieved on a 6 - 8 m class telescope equipped with a camera capable of good psf sampling .",
    "better data would not remove the anticorrelation of the radii illustrated in figure  [ fig:3err ] and briefly discussed in section [ sect : age ] as this is an inherent property of systems with partial eclipses .",
    "the axes of the error ellipses , however , would become smaller . on the modeling side , detailed evolutionary and atmospheric models made specifically to match m4 , for which abundant spectroscopic information is available ,",
    "would improve the accuracy of the age analysis .",
    "the luminosities of the components are found using absolute radii and effective temperatures estimated from @xmath26 - @xmath86 calibrations compiled by @xcite .",
    "the errors are rather large  in excess of 0.1@xmath87 .",
    "a significant improvement may be expected when ir photometry is obtained , and more accurate calibrations linking @xmath88 color to surface brightness in @xmath9 are employed .",
    "the anomalous and nonuniform absorption in the field of m4 would still have to be accounted for , however the relation between @xmath88 and surface brightness is broadly insensitive to moderate reddening @xcite .",
    "the agreement of the distance modulus derived from our debs with that recently derived by @xcite using an entirely different method , together with the fit of the observed photometry to model isochrones , suggests that these uncertainties are not too high",
    ".    a further observational test would be to determine the chemical abundances of the components of the binaries under study using disentangling software ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the existing spectra have an adequate s / n to measure velocities but not abundances .",
    "given the brightnesses of the components and the orbital periods it is possible to obtain higher s / n spectra adequate for abundance analysis purposes .",
