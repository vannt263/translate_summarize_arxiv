    "the discovery of d - brane drastically changed the conventional viewpoint that the standard model fields and the graviton should propagate in the same spacetime .",
    "the standard model fields can be naturally confined on d - brane , while the graviton can freely propagate through the full spacetime .",
    "recently , this concept has been extensively introduced in approaches to resolving the hierarchy problem and getting a small cosmological constant without relying on supersymmetry in the framework of brane world scenarios .    in refs.@xcite",
    ", it was shown that the string scale @xmath1 could be reduced from the four - dimensional planck scale , @xmath2gev , to the electroweak scale , @xmath3gev , by introducing large extra dimensions . however , this scenario has the problem of stabilization of the large extra dimensions or , equivalently , dynamical determination of the large size of extra dimensions in a theory whose fundamental length is the inverse weak scale .",
    "subsequently , randall and sundrum ( rs ) proposed a scheme in which a five - dimensional spacetime contains strongly gravitating 3-branes which produce a warped or nonfactorizable geometry , _",
    "e.g. _ a slice of @xmath4 . in their first model ( rsi ) with two 3-branes @xcite , solving the hierarchy problem does not require large extra dimensions . in the second model ( rsii )",
    "@xcite which has only one 3-brane of positive tension , rs also showed that , even for an infinite extra dimension , the effective gravity theory on the brane can be still four - dimensional and not five - dimensional up to leading behavior , provided that the embedding spacetime has a very particular curvature .",
    "many attempts to resolve the cosmological constant problem have been made within the brane world scenarios @xcite : if our four - dimensional world is embedded in a higher - dimensional spacetime , the changes of the vacuum energy of the brane , the brane tension , may affect only the curvature in the extra dimensions , keeping the poincar invariance of the four - dimensional worldvolume .",
    "various attempts have been made to realize the randall - sundrum scenario within 5-dimensional supergravity theories @xcite and a compactified string or m - theory @xcite . in particular , the authors of ref.@xcite investigated singular , supersymmetric domain - wall solutions supported by the massive breathing mode scalars of reductions in m - theory or string theory .",
    "the spacetime on one side of such a wall asymptotes to the cauchy horizon of the anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime , while there is a naked singularity on the other side .",
    "the higher dimensional interpretation of these domain wall solutions is given as the interior region between the singularity and the horizon of the higher - dimensional non - dilatonic @xmath0-branes @xcite .",
    "this implies that the interior region could provide a setup for brane world scenarios , even though it is normally excluded from the maximal analytic extension .    on the other hand ,",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite considered an extremal black hole - like global defect which was called as ` black global @xmath0-brane ' , and showed that the interior region inside the horizon of the black brane possesses all of features needed for a realistic brane world scenario . in the picture of ref.@xcite",

    ", the change of the brane tension can forcefully be diluted via the hawking radiation , because the change of the brane tension convert the bulk geometry of the extremal black brane into that of a non - extremal one , which evolves back to the extremal one through the hawking radiation process .    in this paper ,",
    "we consider the d3-brane living in the ten - dimensional spacetime and focus on the interior region inside the horizon of the d3-brane .",
    "the interior region has interpolation between the naked singularity and the near horizon region which is the infinitely long ads throat ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "if the singularity is smoothed out by stringy effects , the physics will be close to that of the global black brane of ref.@xcite .",
    "the interior region of d3-brane then can be interpreted as four - dimensional spacetime producted by six extra dimensions compactified to the size of the horizon , in that the four - dimensional planck scale @xmath6 is determined by the ten - dimensional planck scale @xmath7 and the horizon size @xmath8 via the relation @xmath9 , and the gravity on a 3-brane residing in the interior region behaves as expected in a world with six extra dimensions compactified to size @xmath8 . as the result of such interpretation , the compactification scale can be dynamically determined from the underlying string theory which has only one physical scale , _",
    "i.e. _ , string scale @xmath1 .",
    "a large mass hierarchy is then simply translated into large horizon size . moreover , since the size of the horizon is determined by the ramon - ramon ( r - r ) charge of d3-brane , the large mass hierarchy then follows by taking large r - r charge and its stabilization is guaranteed by the conserved nature of the r - r charge .",
    "the observed extremely small cosmological constant could be explained provided that our world brane is embedded in the interior region of a very near - extremal d3-brane .",
    "in string theory , the d@xmath0-brane is a @xmath10-dimensional hyperplane in spacetime where open strings can end @xcite . by the worldsheet duality",
    ", this means that the d - brane is also a source of closed strings .",
    "if there are @xmath11 overlapping branes , open strings with endpoints on different branes correspond to @xmath12 gauge fields localized in the world - volume of d@xmath0-brane . on the other hand , gravity corresponds to closed strings and these can move on the whole 10-dimensional spacetime .    on the other hand",
    ", it is believed that the d@xmath0-brane and the extremal black @xmath0-brane in supergravity are two different descriptions of the same object . for d@xmath0-branes with @xmath13 , the horizon and the singularity coincide , so there is null singularity .",
    "moreover , the dilaton either diverges or vanishes at the horizon .",
    "while , for the d3-brane , the dilaton is constant and the horizon is regular . together with these properties , since the d3-brane has a @xmath14-dimensional world volume , it may provide an interesting and concrete model for attempts to describe our universe as a 3-brane embedded in a higher - dimensional spacetime .",
    "the supergravity solution of d3-brane with @xmath11 units of r - r charge is given by @xmath15 in terms of an appropriately defined schwarzschild - type coordinate @xmath16 , where @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the string length scale and @xmath19 is the string coupling . here",

    "the spacetime has a horizon at @xmath24 and this horizon is regular . and the singularity at @xmath25 is covered with the horizon .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , it is known that the metric ( [ ebs ] ) can be analytically extended through the cauchy horizon at @xmath24 and out into another region .",
    "this can be seen by introducing a new radial coordinate @xmath26 by the relation @xmath27^{1/4}~~\\leftrightarrow~~ r = r_h\\left(1-\\sigma\\omega^{4}\\right)^{-1/4}.\\ ] ] since @xmath16 is an analytic function of @xmath26 on the horizon at @xmath28 , the metric can be extended to negative values of @xmath26 .",
    "the extension is isometric to the original regions because the metric is invariant under @xmath29 . for the exterior solution , repeating the continuation , one obtains a completely non - singular maximal analytic extension of the metric ( [ ebs ] ) .",
    "the interior region is excluded from this extension .",
    "this is the case normally treated in the literatures .",
    "however , we have no reason to exclude the interior region from discussions given our ignorance concerning the singularity .",
    "in fact , there must be a r - r charged @xmath30-function source at @xmath25 because the d3-brane is coupled to the self - dual 5-form field strength and carry both electric `` and magnetic '' charge .",
    "the interior region then can be also analytically extended through the horizon to another region isometric to the original interior region excluding the exterior region .",
    "as well known , the near horizon geometry is the infinitely long ads throat . to see this",
    ", it will be useful to introduce a new radial coordinate @xmath31 by @xmath32^{-5/4}~dr ' , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 runs from @xmath33 to @xmath34 for the interior solution and from @xmath35 to @xmath34 for the exterior solution .",
    "the horizon is now located at @xmath36 for the interior solution and at @xmath37 for the exterior solution . with this new radial coordinate ,",
    "the metric is then written as @xmath38 where the original radial coordinate @xmath16 is given by a function of @xmath31 and its asymptotic behaviors can easily be found . in the near horizon region , we can approximate the metric as @xmath39 which is the geometry of @xmath5 with curvature scales @xmath40 .",
    "this solution is an example of warped metric due to the backreaction of the brane .",
    "so far the black 3-brane have been treated by using the classical supergravity .",
    "this description is appropriate when the curvature of the 3-brane geometry is small compared to the string scale , so that the stringy corrections are negligible .",
    "for the exterior region , since the curvature is bounded by @xmath40 , this requires @xmath41 . to suppress string loop corrections",
    ", the effective string coupling @xmath19 also needs to be kept small .",
    "since the dilaton is constant , we can make it small everywhere in the d3-brane geometry by setting @xmath42 , namely @xmath43 .",
    "that is , the supergravity approximation is valid everywhere when @xmath44 for the exterior solution . since @xmath8 is related to the r - r charge @xmath11 as @xmath45 , this can also be expressed as @xmath46 . on the other hand , since in the interior region",
    "the curvature is not bounded at the origin , the supergravity description will be valid only in a limited region . because the curvature diverges as @xmath47 near the singularity , the interior solution is valid within the region satisfying the condition @xmath48 and the stringy description might be needed in a region where @xmath49 . in terms of the radial coordinate @xmath31 , this corresponds to the region where @xmath50 .",
    "this implies that the singularity could be an artifact of the long - range supergravity approximation .",
    "the singularity is expected to be cured by stringy effects . essentially the source for the r - r field strength is sitting at the singularity , _",
    "i.e. , _ the field energy density diverges as @xmath51 . since only the known source for the r - r 5-form field strength is d3-brane",
    ", we are naturally expected to see a stack of d3-branes when we probe the singularity with energy over the string scale .",
    "either the interior or the exterior region by itself does not seem to provide a suitable framework for a randall - sundrum configuration , because in one direction one may reach an ads horizon , in the other direction one will either run into a singularity or on out into an unbounded flat space . however , as discussed in @xcite in the context of the five - dimensional domain wall solution to the dimensionally reduced type iib theory on @xmath52 , such singular region by itself can provide a suitable framework for a randall - sundrum configuration , provided that the singularity is regularized .    the existence of the massless graviton state is evident because the theory always allows solutions with a general ricci - flat metric @xmath53 , which satisfies the four - dimensional vacuum einstein equation @xmath54 , instead of @xmath55 in the metric ( [ ebs ] ) , and the massless four - dimensional graviton is simply the usual gravitational wave solution of linearized four - dimensional vacuum einstein equation .",
    "the planck scale is finite in spite of the existence of the singularity in the interior region .",
    "one can easily see this examining the four - dimensional effective action .",
    "the four - dimensional planck scale is given in terms of the 10-dimensional planck scale by : @xmath56^{-1/2 }          = m_*^8\\cdot\\frac{\\pi^3}{3 } r_h^6,\\ ] ] where @xmath57 @xmath58 is the 10-dimensional planck scale .",
    "@xmath59 is just @xmath60 times the volume of 6-dimensional sphere , so the radial direction has the effective size of @xmath61 .",
    "eq.([psl ] ) says that the four - dimensional planck scale is determined by the ten - dimensional planck scale and the horizon size via the familiar relation @xmath62 as in the usual kaluza - klein theories .",
    "this implies that the horizon size @xmath8 could be interpreted as the effective size of 6 compact extra dimensions , even though the interior region infinitely extends with radius @xmath8 and an infinitely extended radial direction . despite being noncompact , due to the warped spacetime geometry",
    ", the radial direction yields a finite effective size @xmath63 . ] .",
    "this interpretation could be cleared up through a complete analysis of the effective 4d gravity",
    ".    however , we should be careful in discussion of the graviton state because we do not have a complete understanding of the singularity . for a metric of the form of eq.([ebs ] ) , the gravitational fluctuations are given by replacing @xmath55 with @xmath64 where @xmath65 is small compared with @xmath55 . with the gauge condition @xmath66 , the linear fluctuations satisfy the covariant wave equation@xcite : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the ten - dimensional background metric . using the coordinates of the metric ( [ ebs ] ) and expanding @xmath69 , where @xmath70 denotes angular variables",
    ", we have an equation for the radial wavefunction @xmath71 : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a constant polarization tensor and @xmath74 @xmath75 is the mass of the kk modes .",
    "the second term is the repulsive centrifugal potential which comes from the contribution of angular momentum . as easily expected , this equation is singular at @xmath25 .",
    "since this equation has the asymptotic form near the singularity : @xmath76 the equation ( [ le ] ) requires regular solutions to behave near the singularity as follows @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a constant . in the presence of the singularity ,",
    "a possible boundary condition is simply to require that the fields should not feel the singularity at all : @xmath79 disallowing solutions with @xmath80 at @xmath25 as in @xcite .",
    "then the spectrum is bounded from below and continuous with only positive energies occurring@xcite . and",
    "the wavefunctions with @xmath81 will be suppressed in most of the interior region , as will be cleared up later . for the massless graviton ( @xmath82 ) , eq.([le ] ) admits the constant solution @xmath83 constant .",
    "however , this massless graviton state should be excluded , since it does not vanish at @xmath25 .",
    "hence , the inverse square law for gravity will not be recovered at long distance on a brane residing in the interior region .",
    "another possible boundary condition is the unitary boundary condition which was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the fact that the spacetime is geodesically incomplete would not matter provided that no conserved quantities are allowed to leak out through the boundary .",
    "even though the singularity of the black 3-brane at @xmath25 is point - like and stronger than those considered in @xcite , it is easy to see , following the same procedure as in refs.@xcite , that such boundary condition allows the form of solution ( [ bc ] ) , that is , the flux through the singularity for the solutions having behaviors of ( [ bc ] ) vanishes .",
    "further , the constant solution for the massless graviton is not excluded by such boundary condition .",
    "hence , the usual four - dimensional gravity will be reproduced at long distance , even though the spacetime has a naked singularity .    however , since we do not have a good understanding of the singularity , we will not be able to make any rigorous claim whether such boundary conditions are what we want .",
    "thus , we will simply assume that the singularity is smoothed out by the true short - distance theory of gravity , namely , string theory .",
    "the singular source of the r - r field then will be look like a smooth 3-brane .",
    "since these effects will only modify the metric close to the singularity , they only slightly change the shape of the wavefunctions .",
    "the massless graviton then is always allowed and the correct four - dimensional gravity is reproduced at long distance on a the 3-brane .",
    "all of the important physics follows from a qualitative analysis of these potentials .",
    "the full form of the schrdinger potential @xmath87 is sketched in fig . [",
    "fig : schpo ] .",
    "we see that the potential near the singularity approaches a negative infinity as @xmath92",
    ". however , the negative infinity of the potential should be cut off at distances @xmath93 after smoothing out the singularity . without a detailed understanding of the theory in such strongly gravitating region",
    ", we will not know the shape of the potential and so the shape of the wavefunctions near the origin . in @xcite , a model which modify the metric within the distance @xmath93 was presented to get an indication of the sort of modifications that can be expected once stringy corrections are taken into account .",
    "as we will see , however , such models are not needed in analyzing the wavefunctions in the interior region , because the amplitude of the wavefunction near the origin is insensitive to the detailed shape of the potential near the origin .",
    "a bump results from the ads spacetime near the horizon .",
    "the potential has a maximum value @xmath94 at @xmath95 and is zero at @xmath96 showing that the central region of the potential is smaller than the ads scale @xmath40 .",
    "the potential also approaches zero as @xmath97 near the horizon at @xmath36 . for @xmath98-wave modes with @xmath99 ,",
    "the potential in the near horizon region is identical to that of the original randall - sundrum model . while wave modes with @xmath100 will see the additional repulsive centrifugal potential and will be much more suppressed near the origin than @xmath98-wave modes .",
    "the zero mode solution is easily identified from eq.([sch ] ) as @xmath101 , which corresponds to the constant zero - mode solution of eq.([le ] ) . here , @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) is the normalization factor . the function @xmath104 is plotted in fig.[fig : schpo ] .",
    "clearly , the graviton is localized in the central region of the potential , even though @xmath104 rapidly approaches zero as @xmath105 at the very near of the origin when the regularization is not imposed .",
    "this seems to show that the gravity is completely decoupled from the @xmath30-function like source at the singularity .",
    "the function @xmath106 , however , should be modified near the origin when the singularity is regularized . since @xmath107 at @xmath93 , the function @xmath106 does not significantly change in the central region @xmath108 , even for the large difference of order @xmath109 . hence",
    ", the central region looks like a one - sided randall - sundrum domain wall embedded in @xmath4 upon dimensional reduction . and",
    "the continuum modes in the near horizon region are given by a linear combination of bessel functions @xmath110,\\ ] ] where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are @xmath74-dependent coefficients to be determined by normalization and boundary conditions .",
    "the bump resulting from the ads spacetime causes the continuum modes with masses @xmath113 to be suppressed in the central region of the potential ( close to the singularity ) .",
    "it is difficult to find quantitative behaviors of the continuum modes in the central region of the potential directly solving the schrdinger equation .",
    "however , when the central region of the potential is localized within the ads curvature length scale , the behaviors of the continuum modes can be determined from the asymptotic solution ( [ bes ] ) using some matching conditions , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "following the same procedure as in @xcite , we obtain the value of the radial wavefunction in the central region up to the leading order in @xmath74 , @xmath114 while the continuum modes with @xmath115 will sail over the potential and will be unsuppressed in the central region . in order to see the physics more explicitly ,",
    "suppose a stack of d3-brane sitting at the origin which is strongly gravitating or a probe 3-brane residing at a point in the central region @xmath116 which is very light .",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath117 of a test particle with mass @xmath118 on the brane then is given by @xmath119 where @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) is the four - dimensional gravitational constant and @xmath122 is the distance from the test particle on the brane .",
    "@xmath30 is a power of proper measure for sums over the continuum modes and has @xmath123 for small @xmath124 and @xmath125 for large @xmath124 . for large distances",

    "the leading correction behave like @xmath129 , as in the original randall - sundrum model , rather than @xmath130 , which may usually be expected to be for randall - sundrum type models with @xmath131 extra dimensions . on the other hand , for distances @xmath132 , the continuum modes with @xmath133 are dominant and has unsuppressed wave functions in the central region",
    ". modes with large @xmath124 largely contribute to the short distance gravity and then @xmath134 in the integrand of eq.([grv ] ) .",
    "therefore , for @xmath132 , we get the 10-dimensional gravitational potential @xmath135    hence , the behavior of the gravity on the brane is exactly what we would expect by interpreting @xmath8 as a compactification radius \" , concretely supporting the interpretation of the horizon size as the compactification scale .",
    "that is , the interior region of the d3-brane looks like the four - dimensional spacetime producted by six extra dimensions compactified to the size of the horizon . indeed , to an observer living outside the horizon , this interpretation seems correct in that the interior region occupies only a finite part of volume @xmath136 of the transverse space .",
    "the apparent infinite extension of the interior region is simply the result of the warping of the extra dimensions by the gravity produced by the d3-brane .    the physics on a brane residing in the central region interpolates between the randall - sundrum one and the large extra dimensional scenario relying on the size @xmath8 of the horizon . in case",

    "since the information on the compactified sphere @xmath52 is reflected only through the extremely suppressed contribution from modes with @xmath100 and moduli fields associated with the radius @xmath8 of @xmath52 have masses of the order of the string scale , the phenomenology on the brane world is imperceptibly different from that of the original randall - sundrum scenario .",
    "this is what is expected from the supergravity domain wall solution of ref.@xcite to the dimensionally reduced type iib theory on @xmath52 .",

    "the proper interpretation of this singularity will likely be crucial to understanding the physics on the world brane .",
    "for example , the singularity may force the short - distance properties of quantum gravity to become relevant to the physics at long distances .",

    "notice that the curvature singularity at @xmath150 is resolved through this process .",
    "as discussed in ref.@xcite , we may take this as a possible mechanism of resolution of various problems associated with the brane world scenario .",
    "for example , for the metric ( [ nebb ] ) the bulk curvature leads to violation of the @xmath172 isometry , in the d3-brane worldvolume direction , observed in our brane , so there must be some mechanism to flatten the bulk in the absence of some symmetry which protect the @xmath172 isometry @xcite .",
    "clearly , the bulk curvature can be diluted via the hawking radiation because in the extremal limit the bulk curvature vanishes and the @xmath172 isometry of the d3-brane worldvolume is recovered .    in general , excitations of the extremal black @xmath0-brane would correspond to either non - ricci flat @xmath173 such that @xmath174 , or even to depend on the extra dimension coordinates @xmath175 .",
    "then the corresponding non - extremal metric would have different forms from the metric eq.([nebb ] ) .",
    "even though we do nt have such metric yet , we expect that the spacetime structure will be close to that of metric ( [ nebb ] ) and so the excitations will be diluted via hawking radiation .",
    "hence , with the same argument as in ref.@xcite the observed extremely small cosmological constant could be explained , provided that our world brane is embedded in the interior region of a very near - extremal black brane .",
    "the change of the vacuum energy density of the brane which may break the poincar invariance of the d3-brane worldvolume will be diluted through the hawking radiation process . in the same way , the observed flatness and approximate lorentz invariance of our world brane",
    "could be also explained .",
    "we have shown that the interior region inside the horizon of the d3-brane possesses all of features needed for a realistic brane world scenario which interpolates between the randall - sundrum scenario and the large extra dimension scenario , provided that the singularity at the origin is smoothed out . in this picture",
    ", the horizon size can be interpreted as the compactification size in that the four - dimensional planck scale @xmath6 is determined by the 10-dimensional planck scale @xmath176 and the size of the horizon @xmath8 via the familiar relation @xmath62 and the effective gravity on a 3-brane residing in the interior region behaves as expected in a world with six extra dimensions compactified with size @xmath8 .",
    "the most important consequence of the above picture seems that the macroscopically large compactification scale can be derived from the underlying string theory that has only one physical scale , _",
    "i.e. , _ the string scale @xmath18 .",
    "that is , the size of the large extra dimensions is provided by the large r - r charge of the d3-brane and its stabilization is strictly guaranteed from the charge conservation law .",
    "then , the hierarchy between the planck scale and the string scale is dynamically determined by the magnitude of the r - r charge @xmath11 carried by the d3-brane without introducing any additional scale .    in this picture , the finetuning required in the original rs setup in order to ensure the vanishing of the four - dimensional cosmological constant could be eliminated .",
    "the vacuum energy density of the brane can be diluted through the hawking radiation and the observed extremely small cosmological constant can be explained provided that our world brane is a very near - extremal d3-brane . the observed flatness and approximate lorentz invariance of our world brane could be explained with the same token .",
