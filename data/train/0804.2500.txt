    "we are concerned with the regularity of global solutions to shock wave reflection by wedges .",
    "the shock reflection problem is one of the most important problems in mathematical fluid dynamics , which not only arises in many important physical situations but also is fundamental for the mathematical theory of multidimensional conservation laws that is still largely incomplete ; its solutions are building blocks and asymptotic attractors of general solutions to the multidimensional euler equations for compressible fluids ( cf .",
    "courant - friedrichs @xcite , von neumann @xcite , glimm - majda @xcite , and morawetz @xcite ; also see @xcite ) . in chen - feldman @xcite ,",
    "the first global existence theory of shock reflection configurations for potential flow has been established when the wedge angle @xmath2 is large , which converge to the unique solution of the normal reflection when @xmath2 tends to @xmath3 .",
    "the solution @xmath4 is quasi - subsonic within the sonic circle for state ( 2 ) with center @xmath5 and radius @xmath6 and is quasi - supersonic outside this circle containing arc @xmath7 in figure [ fig : regularreflection ] , so that @xmath4 is the unique solution in the domain @xmath8 as argued in @xcite . in the domain @xmath9 , the solution is proved to be quasi - subsonic , smooth , and @xmath0-smoothly matching with state ( 2 ) across @xmath7 and to satisfy @xmath10 on @xmath11 ; the transonic shock @xmath12 matches up to second - order with @xmath13 and is orthogonal to the @xmath14-axis at @xmath15 so that the standard reflection about the @xmath14-axis yields a global solution in the whole plane .",
    "however , most of the fundamental issues for shock reflection by wedges have not been understood , including the regularity and transition of the different patterns of shock reflection configurations .",
    "therefore , it is important to establish the regularity of solutions to shock reflection in order to understand fully the phenomena of shock reflection , including the case of potential flow which is widely used in aerodynamics ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand , for the regular reflection configuration as in fig .",
    "1 , the potential flow governs the exact behavior of solutions in @xmath0 across the pseudo - sonic ( _ sonic _ , for short below ) circle @xmath7 even starting from the full euler flow , that is , both of the nonlinear systems are actually the same in a physically significant region near the sonic circle ; thus , it becomes essential to understand the optimal regularity of solutions for the potential flow across the sonic circle @xmath7 and at the point @xmath16 where the sonic circle meets the reflected shock .        in this paper , we develop a mathematical approach in sections 24 to establish the regularity of solutions to regular shock reflection with the configuration as in fig . 1 for potential flow .",
    "in particular , we prove that the @xmath0-regularity is _ optimal _ for the solution across the open part @xmath7 of the sonic circle ( the degenerate elliptic curve ) and at the point @xmath16 where the sonic circle meets the reflected shock ( as a free boundary ) .",
    "the problem involves two types of transonic flow : one is a continuous transition through the sonic circle @xmath7 from the pseudo - supersonic ( _ supersonic _ , for short below ) region ( 2 ) to the pseudo - subsonic ( _ subsonic _ , for short below ) region @xmath9 ; the other is a jump transition through the transonic shock as a free boundary from the supersonic region ( 1 ) to the subsonic region @xmath9 . to achieve the optimal regularity ,",
    "one of the main difficulties is that the part @xmath7 of the sonic circle is the transonic boundary separating the elliptic region from the hyperbolic region . near @xmath7 ,",
    "the solution is governed by a nonlinear equation , whose main part has the form : @xmath17 where @xmath18 are constants , and which is elliptic in @xmath19 where @xmath20 , with elliptic degeneracy at @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "we analyze the features of equations modeled by and prove the @xmath23 regularity of solutions of shock reflection problem in the elliptic region up to the open part @xmath7 of the sonic circle . as a corollary , we establish that the @xmath0-regularity is actually optimal across the transonic boundary @xmath7 from the elliptic to hyperbolic region .",
    "since the reflected shock @xmath12 is regarded as a free boundary connecting the hyperbolic region ( 1 ) with the elliptic region @xmath9 for the nonlinear second - order equation of mixed type , another difficulty for the optimal regularity of the solution is that the point @xmath16 is exactly the one where the degenerate elliptic curve @xmath7 meets a transonic free boundary for the nonlinear partial differential equation of second order . as far as we know , this is the first optimal regularity result for solutions to a free boundary problem of nonlinear degenerate elliptic equations at the point where an elliptic degenerate curve meets the free boundary . to achieve this ,",
    "we construct two sequences of points such that the corresponding sequences of values of @xmath24 have different limits at @xmath16 ; this is done by employing the @xmath23 regularity of the solution up to @xmath7 excluding the point @xmath16 , and by studying detailed features of the free boundary conditions on the free boundary @xmath12 , i.e. , the rankine - hugoniot conditions .",
    "we note that the global theory of existence and regularity of regular reflection configurations for the polytropic case @xmath25 , established in @xcite and sections 24 , applies to the isothermal case @xmath26 as well .",
    "the techniques and ideas developed in this paper will be useful to other regularity problems for nonlinear degenerate equations involving similar difficulties .",
    "the regularity for certain degenerate elliptic and parabolic equations has been studied ( cf .",
    "@xcite and the references cited therein ) . the main feature that distinguishes equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) from the equations in daskalopoulos - hamilton @xcite and lin - wang @xcite is the crucial role of the nonlinear term @xmath27",
    "indeed , if @xmath28 , then ( [ 1.1 ] ) becomes a linear equation @xmath29 then @xmath30 is a solution of ( [ maineq - mainlinearterms ] ) , and @xmath31 with @xmath32 also satisfies the conditions : @xmath33 let @xmath34 be a solution of ( [ maineq - mainlinearterms ] ) in @xmath35 satisfying ( [ 1.3])([1.4 - 1 ] ) .",
    "then the comparison principle implies that @xmath36 in @xmath37 for sufficiently small @xmath32 .",
    "it follows that the solutions of ( [ maineq - mainlinearterms ] ) satisfying ( [ 1.3])([1.4 - 1 ] ) are not even @xmath0 up to @xmath21 . on the other hand , for the nonlinear equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) with @xmath38 ,",
    "the function @xmath39 is a smooth solution of ( [ 1.1 ] ) up to @xmath21 satisfying ( [ 1.3])([1.4 - 1 ] ) .",
    "more general @xmath0 solutions of ( [ 1.1 ] ) satisfying ( [ 1.3])([1.4 - 1 ] ) and the condition @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which implies the ellipticity of ( [ 1.1 ] ) , can be constructed by using the methods of @xcite , and their @xmath23 regularity up to @xmath21 follows from this paper",
    ". another feature of the present case is that , for solutions of ( [ 1.1 ] ) satisfying ( [ 1.3])([1.4 ] ) and ( [ 1.5 ] ) , we compute explicitly @xmath43 on @xmath21 to find that @xmath44 and @xmath45 for all such solutions . thus , all the solutions are separated in @xmath23 from the solution @xmath46 , although it is easy to construct a sequence of solutions of ( [ 1.1 ] ) satisfying ( [ 1.3])([1.4 ] ) and ( [ 1.5 ] ) which converges to @xmath46 in @xmath47 .",
    "this shows that the @xmath23-regularity of ( [ 1.1 ] ) with conditions ( [ 1.3])([1.4 ] ) and ( [ 1.5 ] ) is a truly nonlinear phenomenon of degenerate elliptic equations .",
    "some efforts have been also made mathematically for the shock reflection problem via simplified models , including the unsteady transonic small - disturbance ( utsd ) equation ( cf .",
    "keller - blank @xcite , hunter - keller @xcite , hunter @xcite , morawetz @xcite ) and the pressure gradient equation or the nonlinear wave system ( cf .",
    "zheng @xcite , canic - keyfitz - kim @xcite ) . on the other hand , in order to understand the existence and regularity of solutions near the important physical points and for the reflection problem , some asymptotic methods have been also developed ( cf .",
    "lighthill @xcite , keller - blank @xcite , hunter - keller @xcite , harabetian @xcite , and morawetz @xcite ) .",
    "also see chen @xcite for a linear approximation of shock reflection when the wedge angle is close to @xmath48 and serre @xcite for an apriori analysis of solutions of shock reflection and related discussions in the context of the euler equations for isentropic and adiabatic fluids .",
    "we remark that our regularity results for potential flow near the sonic circle confirm rigorously the asymptotic scalings used by hunter - keller @xcite , harabetian @xcite , and morawetz @xcite .",
    "indeed , the @xmath23 regularity up to the sonic circle away from @xmath16 and its proof based on the comparison with an ordinary differential equation in the radial direction confirm their asymptotic scaling via the differential equation in that region .",
    "the optimal @xmath0 regularity at @xmath16 shows that the asymptotic scaling does not work there , i.e. , the angular derivatives become large , as stated in @xcite .    to achieve this ,",
    "we first study the regularity of positive solutions near degenerate boundary with dirichlet data for the nonlinear degenerate elliptic equation : @xmath49 where @xmath50 are constants and , for @xmath51 , @xmath52 equation ( [ maineq - mainterms ] ) is elliptic with respect to @xmath34 in @xmath19 if @xmath53 . in this paper",
    ", we consider the solutions that satisfy @xmath54 for some constants @xmath55 and @xmath56 . then ( [ maineq - mainterms ] ) is uniformly elliptic in every subdomain @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "thus the interior regularity @xmath59 follows .",
    "therefore , we focus on the regularity of @xmath34 near the boundary part @xmath21 where the ellipticity of ( [ maineq - mainterms ] ) degenerates .",
    "the equations of this form arises in the study of shock reflection in gas dynamics by chen - feldman in @xcite .",
    "they also occur in .... ( ?",
    "the region @xmath19 corresponds to the subsonic region in a flow , and the potential flow equation in the subsonic region near the sonic line @xmath21 can be written as @xmath60 where @xmath61 are certain smooth functions , explicitly given . the solution @xmath34 of ( [ maineq - allterms ] ) , constructed in @xcite , has the following properties : @xmath62 equation is elliptic with respect to @xmath34 in @xmath19 , and ( [ x - deriv - small ] ) holds .",

    ". estimates ( [ oks - int])([oks - der - int ] ) imply that the terms @xmath67 are `` small '' , the precise meaning of which can be seen in the estimates of @xcite and in section [ proofmainregthmsect ] below .",
    "thus , the main terms of equation ( [ maineq - allterms ] ) form equation ( [ maineq - mainterms ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the solution @xmath34 constructed in @xcite is @xmath0 in the subsonic region @xmath19 up to the sonic line @xmath21 and across the sonic line .",
    "a further question is whether the @xmath68 regularity of the solution can be achieved up to the sonic line and across the sonic line .",
    "we apply our regularity results for equation in section 2 to study these questions in section [ regnrsonicsect ] below .",
    "we now state our main regularity result for the degenerate elliptic equation ( [ maineq - allterms ] ) .",
    "[ mainregularitythm ] let @xmath69 and @xmath70 be constants .",

    "we will always assume this hereafter .",
    "the organization of this paper is the following . in section 2",
    ", we describe the shock reflection problem by a wedge and its solution with regular reflection configuration when the wedge angle is suitably large . in section 3",
    ", we establish a regularity theory for solutions near the degenerate boundary with dirichlet data for a class of nonlinear degenerate elliptic equations , in order to study the regularity of solutions to the regular reflection problem .",
    "then we employ the regularity theory developed in section 3 to establish the optimal regularity of solutions for @xmath25 across the sonic circle @xmath7 and at the point @xmath16 where the sonic circle @xmath7 meets the reflected shock @xmath12 in section 4 .",
    "we also established the @xmath23-regularity of solutions in the subsonic region up to the sonic circle @xmath7 .",
    "we further observe that the existence and regularity results for regular reflection configurations for the polytropic case @xmath25 apply to the isothermal case @xmath26 .",
    "we remark in passing that there may exist a global regular reflection configuration when state ( 2 ) is pseudo - subsonic , which is in a very narrow regime ( see @xcite ) . in this case , the regularity of the solution behind the reflected shock is direct , and the main difficulty of elliptic degeneracy does not occur .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we focus on the difficult case for the regularity problem when state ( 2 ) is pseudo - supersonic , which will be simply called a regular shock reflection configuration , throughout this paper .",
    "in this section , we describe the shock reflection problem by a wedge and its solution with regular reflection configuration when the wedge angle is suitably large .    the euler equations for potential flow consist of the conservation law of mass and the bernoulli law for the density @xmath87 and the velocity potential @xmath88 : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the bernoulli constant determined by the incoming flow and/or boundary conditions , and @xmath91 with @xmath92 being the sound speed . for polytropic gas , by scaling , @xmath93",

    "<S> the shock reflection problem is one of the most important problems in mathematical fluid dynamics , since this problem not only arises in many important physical situations but also is fundamental for the mathematical theory of multidimensional conservation laws that is still largely incomplete . </S>",
    "<S> however , most of the fundamental issues for shock reflection have not been understood , including the regularity and transition of the different patterns of shock reflection configurations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is important to establish the regularity of solutions to shock reflection in order to understand fully the phenomena of shock reflection . on the other hand , for a regular reflection configuration , the potential flow governs the exact behavior of the solution in @xmath0 across the pseudo - sonic circle even starting from the full euler flow , that is , both of the nonlinear systems are actually the same in an physically significant region near the pseudo - sonic circle ; thus , it becomes essential to understand the optimal regularity of solutions for the potential flow across the pseudo - sonic circle ( the transonic boundary from the elliptic to hyperbolic region ) and at the point where the pseudo - sonic circle ( the degenerate elliptic curve ) meets the reflected shock ( a free boundary connecting the elliptic to hyperbolic region ) . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we study the regularity of solutions to regular shock reflection for potential flow . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we prove that the @xmath0-regularity is _ optimal _ for the solution across the pseudo - sonic circle and at the point where the pseudo - sonic circle meets the reflected shock . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain the @xmath1 regularity of the solution up to the pseudo - sonic circle in the pseudo - subsonic region . </S>",
    "<S> the problem involves two types of transonic flow : one is a continuous transition through the pseudo - sonic circle from the pseudo - supersonic region to the pseudo - subsonic region ; the other a jump transition through the transonic shock as a free boundary from another pseudo - supersonic region to the pseudo - subsonic region . the techniques and ideas developed in this paper will be useful to other regularity problems for nonlinear degenerate equations involving similar difficulties . </S>"
