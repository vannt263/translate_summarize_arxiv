    "astro - h , the new japanese x - ray astronomy satellite@xcite following the currently - operational suzaku satellite , aims to fulfill the following scientific goals :    * revealing the large - scale structure of the universe and its evolution . *",
    "understanding the extreme conditions of the universe . * exploring the diverse phenomena of the non - thermal universe . * elucidating dark matter and dark energy .    in order to fulfill the above objectives , the astro - h satellite hosts the following four types of instruments : sxt ( soft x - ray telescope ) + sxs ( soft x - ray spectrometer ) , sxt + sxi ( soft x - ray imager ) , hxt ( hard x - ray telescope ) + hxi ( hard x - ray imager)@xcite and sgd ( soft gamma - ray detector ) @xcite .",
    "the sgd will cover the energy range of 60600  kev with a high sensitivity .",
    "the sgd utilizes semiconductor detectors using si and cdte pixel sensors with good energy resolution ( @xmath12  kev ) for the compton camera , which were made possible by recent progress on the development of low noise si gamma - ray sensors@xcite and high quality cdte sensors@xcite .",
    "the bgo active shield provides a low background environment by rejecting the majority of external backgrounds .",
    "internal backgrounds are rejected based on the inconsistency between the constraint on the incident angle of gamma rays from compton kinematics and that from the narrow fov ( field of view ) of the collimator .",
    "this additional background rejection by compton kinematics will improve the sensitivity by an order of magnitude in the 60600  kev band compared with the currently operating space - based instruments .    in this paper",
    ", we will present the detailed configuration and the data acquisition system of the sgd compton camera . we will also present the performance evaluated for the final prototype , which is equivalent to the flight model .",
    "the sgd is based on the concept of narrow fov compton telescopes@xcite , combining compton cameras and active well - type shields .",
    "the active well - type shield concept originates from the hard x - ray detector ( hxd)@xcite onboard the suzaku satellite .",
    "the hxd achieves the best sensitivities in the hard x - ray band , consisting of si photodiodes and gso scintillators with bgo active shield and copper passive collimator .",
    "the sgd , however , replaces the si photodiodes and gso scintillators with the compton camera , which provides additional information for the background rejection .",
    "figure  [ fig : sgd - concept ] shows a conceptual drawing of an sgd unit .",
    "a bgo collimator defines a field of view of @xmath210@xmath3 for high energy photons while a fine collimator restricts the fov to @xmath10.6@xmath3 for low energy photons ( @xmath1150  kev ) , which is essential to minimize the cxb ( cosmic x - ray background ) and source confusion .",
    "scintillation light from the bgo crystals is detected by avalanche photo - diodes ( apds ) allowing for a compact design compared to phototubes .",
    "the hybrid design of the compton camera module incorporates both si and cdte imaging detectors .",
    "the si sensors are used as detectors for compton scattering since compton scattering is the dominant process in si above @xmath250  kev compared with @xmath2300  kev for cdte .",
    "the si sensors also provide better constraints on the compton kinematics because of smaller effect of doppler broadening@xcite .",
    "the cdte sensors are used to absorb gamma rays following compton scattering in the si sensors .",
    "the astro - h mission - level science objectives described above require the sgd to provide spectroscopy up to 600  kev for over 10 accreting supermassive black holes with fluxes equivalent to 1/1000 of the crab nebula ( as measured over the 210  kev band , assuming the spectrum to be a power - law with spectral index of 1.7 ) .",
    "this mission - level science requirement defines the following instrument - level requirements for the sgd compton camera :    * effective area for the detector must be greater than 20  @xmath4 at 100  kev to obtain a sufficient number of photons in a reasonable observation time ( typically 100  ks ) .",
    "* observation energy range must be from 60  kev to 600  kev .",
    "* energy resolution must be better than 2  kev ( fwhm ) or better than 2% ( fwhm ) .",
    "there are the following design constraints on the sgd compton camera fro mounting the astro - h :    * the size of one camera must be 12  cm  @xmath0  12  cm  @xmath0  12  cm to minimize the size of bgo active shield , since the bgo is the dominant contributor to the total weight of the sgd .",
    "* the number of compton cameras must be six in total astro - h .",
    "* power consumption must be lower than 6  w for one camera .",
    "the instrument - level requirements and the design constraints described above guide the designs of the si sensor , the cdte sensor and the readout application specific integrated circuit ( asic ) for both .",
    "the detection area of the si sensor must be larger than 5  cm  @xmath0  5  cm .",
    "the total thickness of the si sensor must be about 2  cm , which corresponds to the 50% interaction efficiency for 100  kev photons .",
    "therefore , 32 layers of si sensors are needed when 0.6  mm thick si devices are used . in order to satisfy the effective area requirement , cdte sensors must cover 50% of the solid angle covered by the si sensors .",
    "the readout asics for the si and cdte sensors must have an internal analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) and must be controllable with digital signals because space in the compton camera is limited .",
    "moreover , the asic must consume less than 0.5  mw / channel and have good noise performance of 100200  e- ( enc ) under the condition that the input capacitance is several  pf .",
    "based on the design guide described in the last section , the compton camera consists of 32 layers of si sensors and 8 layers of cdte sensors surrounded by 2 layers of cdte sensors .",
    "figure  [ fig : cc - structure ] shows a 3d model of the compton camera structure .",
    "this arrangement allows a placement of the cdte sensor on the side very close to the stacked si and cdte sensors , maximizing the coverage of the photons scattered by the si sensors .",
    "in addition to sensor modules , the compton camera holds an asic controller board ( acb ) and four asic driver boards ( adbs ) .",
    "the acb holds a field programmable gate array ( fpga ) that controls the asics .",
    "the adb buffers control signals from the acb , sends control signals to 52 asics , and also provides a current limiter to power the asics .",
    "the mechanical structure of the compton camera needs to hold all components described above within a volume of @xmath5  @xmath6 .",
    "another important requirement for the mechanical structure is sensor cooling .",
    "all sensors need to have a temperature that is within 5@xmath3c of the cold plate interface at the bottom of the compton camera .",
    "c ( a ) +   +   + ( b ) +   +   + ( c ) +     figure  [ fig : cc - structure ] ( a ) shows the mechanical support structure of the compton camera . the compton camera consists of a stack of si and cdte sensor trays as shown in figure  [ fig : cc - structure ] ( b ) .",
    "in addition to the stack , one `` side cdte sensor module '' is installed on each side as shown in figure  [ fig : cc - structure ] ( c ) .",
    "each adb is attached to the side cdte sensor module and an acb is attached to the bottom frame .",
    "the material of the sensor tray structure employs polymide .",
    "the main performance requirements for an asic are low noise and low power . in order to satisfy these main requirements ,",
    "the asic was developed based on the viking architecture@xcite which is known for good noise performance and has been in various space experiments like swift@xcite , pamela@xcite and agile@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : viking ] shows the circuit diagram for the asic developed for the sgd ( and hxi ) of astro - h .",
    "each channel consists of charge sensitive amplifier followed by two shapers .",
    "one shaper with a short shaping time is followed by a discriminator to form a trigger signal .",
    "the other shaper with a long shaping time is followed by a sample and hold circuit to hold the pulse height at the timing specified by an external hold signal .",
    "many important functionalities are integrated in the asic for the sgd in order to minimize additional components required to read out the signal , as shown in the circuit diagram with a blue background region .",
    "the signals in all channels are converted to digital values concurrently with wilkinson - type analog - to - digital converters ( adcs ) .",
    "the conversion time is less than 100  @xmath7s . in order to minimize the readout time , the only channels that are read out are those above a data threshold that can be digitally set for each channel independently from the trigger threshold .",
    "we usually observe common mode noise from this type of asic at the level of @xmath21  kev .",
    "common mode noise has to be subtracted to accurately apply the threshold for the zero suppression .",
    "the common mode noise level of each event is detected by taking an adc value of the 32nd [ a half of total number of channels ] pulse height , corresponding to a median value of all adc values . with zero suppression , the readout time is @xmath8s per asic when no data is readout and @xmath9s when we readout @xmath10 channels . without zero suppression ,",
    "the readout time becomes @xmath11s per asic .",
    "the asic produces all necessary analog bias currents and voltages on the chip by internal digital to analog converters ( dacs ) except for the main bias current which sets the scale of all bias currents .",
    "each bit of the registers for all internal dacs and other functions consists of three flip - flops and a majority selector for tolerance against single event upset ( seu ) .",
    "if the majority selector detects any discrepancies among three flip - flops , it will set a seu flag which will be readout as a part of output data .",

    "digital signals that are not used frequently are single ended between the adb and the acb due to constraints on the cable pin count .",

    "the pseudo triggers are generated by the acb fpgas internally and are then processed in the same manner as usual triggers .",
    "since the pseudo events are discarded if the pseudo trigger is generated while a `` real event '' is inhibiting other triggers , the dead - time fraction can be estimated by counting a number of pseudo events , output to the telemetry , and comparing with the expected counts during the same exposure .",
    "although periodic pseudo triggers were used in the hxd system , the random pseudo trigger function is developed for the sgd system .",
    "a random pseudo trigger function is based on the pseudorandom numbers calculated in the fpga and the expected count rate can be set up to 422  hz .",

    "these spectral characteristics satisfy the requirement for the sgd compton camera , better than 2%(fwhm ) .    by using the information gained from compton scattering , we can obtain a constraint of the incident angle and",

    "the selection criteria for @xmath25ba and @xmath26cs are @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the spectral components besides emission lines are compressed with the selection , because these components are mainly generated by the gamma rays scattered by the materials around the camera and the radio isotope .",

    "<S> the sgd achieves low background by combining a compton camera scheme with a narrow field - of - view active shield . </S>",
    "<S> the compton camera in the sgd is realized as a hybrid semiconductor detector system which consists of silicon and cadmium telluride ( cdte ) sensors . </S>",

    "<S> the compton camera has overall dimensions of 12  cm  @xmath0  12  cm  @xmath0  12  cm , consisting of 32 layers of si pixel sensors and 8 layers of cdte pixel sensors surrounded by 2 layers of cdte pixel sensors . </S>",
    "<S> the detection efficiency of the compton camera reaches about 15% and 3% for 100  kev and 511  kev gamma rays , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the pixel pitch of the si and cdte sensors is 3.2 mm , and the signals from all 13312 pixels are processed by 208 asics developed for the sgd . </S>",
    "<S> good energy resolution is afforded by semiconductor sensors and low noise asics , and the obtained energy resolutions with the prototype si and cdte pixel sensors are 1.02.0 kev ( fwhm ) at 60 kev and 1.62.5 kev ( fwhm ) at 122 kev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this results in good background rejection capability due to better constraints on compton kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> compton camera energy resolutions achieved with the final prototype are 6.3  kev ( fwhm ) at 356  kev and 10.5  kev ( fwhm ) at 662  kev , respectively , which satisfy the instrument requirements for the sgd compton camera ( better than 2% ) . </S>",
