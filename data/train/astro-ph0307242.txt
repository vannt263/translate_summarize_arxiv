    "as we probe to higher redshifts , changes in the structural properties of galaxies provide necessary information to understand their formation and evolution . the fundamental plane ( fp )",
    "is one of the main correlations that reflect the internal structure of early - type galaxies , and so has become a primary tool for studying galaxy evolution .",
    "since the fundamental plane relates sizes , magnitudes , and velocity dispersions , changes in relative positions and the density distribution within the fundamental plane not only allow us to determine which evolutionary processes are dominant at early times , but also provide important information as to the formation epoch .",
    "all three properties may have evolutionary signatures : galaxies may grow in size due to accretion , change their brightness due to the stellar population , and even alter their projected internal dispersions due to evolution in the orbital structure or mass growth .",
    "the most important evolutionary effect is likely the fading of galaxies as the stellar population ages ; based on current formation times for stars in elliptical galaxies  generally accepted to be before @xmath0=2we should then expect substantial fading from @xmath0=1 to the present .",
    "in fact , many groups measure values consistent with this picture : van  dokkum  et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) find almost one magnitude of evolution in the surface brightness for a cluster at @xmath0=0.83 , while bender  et  al.(1998 ) , kelson  et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and jrgensen  et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) find consistent numbers for clusters at lower redshifts .",
    "the evidence to date points to a formation epoch for cluster ellipticals at @xmath4 .",
    "cluster galaxies likely represent one of the earliest populations to form ; because they exist in high - density regions that rapidly condensed out of the initial mass fluctuations , we expect them to show the oldest stellar populations .",
    "galaxies in the field require longer timescales for their formation , and we might therefore expect to see differences between field and cluster galaxies in their fundamental plane properties .",
    "comparison of the two samples provides a relative timescale for galaxy formation that depends on environment , which helps to constrain cosmological models .",
    "our goal is to explore the properties of a well defined sample of field galaxies . at redshifts around one ,",
    "the predicted age difference between field and cluster galaxies is around 3gyr ( kauffmann 1996 ) , which , for single - burst stellar populations , would translate into a one - magnitude difference in offset from the fundamental plane .",
    "there are other groups measuring the properties of field ellipticals .",
    "van  dokkum  et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) present 18 galaxies out to a redshift of 0.55 and find slightly more evolution in the field galaxies compared to their cluster sample , but the small differences only imply a very modest formation age difference of 1 gyr or less .",
    "van  dokkum & ellis ( 2003 ) extend this analysis with field galaxies in the north hubble deep field out to redshift of one , and also find very little difference between cluster and field galaxies .",
    "treu  et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) study the fp evolution from 30 field galaxies between redshifts 0.1 to 0.66 and find an evolution in the luminosity larger than what has been found for the cluster samples , consistent with a much more recent formation epoch around @xmath5 .",
    "however , koopmans & treu ( 2002 ) provide one galaxy at redshift 1.0 which has a magnitude offset in the fp consistent with the cluster galaxy offsets .",
    "thus , there is no clear picture of the differences , if any , between cluster and field ellipticals .",
    "one problem is that at redshifts less than 0.7 , the expected magnitude differences are small even for galaxies with formation epochs separated by a few gyr .",
    "the passive luminosity evolution for a galaxy is greatest when the galaxy is less than 2 gyrs old , and the amount of evolution rapidly decreases after that .",
    "thus , the magnitude difference going from 4 to 7 gyr is significantly less than that going from 1 to 4 gyr . given the uncertainties and intrinsic scatter in fp studies , it is imperative to push the data to as high a redshift as possible to see the differences",
    ". this paper presents results for 36 galaxies between @xmath6 , with a median redshift of 0.8 .",

    "the goal is to study the morphological and kinematic state of galaxies at redshifts from 0.5 to 1.0 .",
    "this project is a long - term endeavor , and initial results have provided an important increase in our understanding of disk galaxy formation and evolution ( vogt  et  al.1996 ; simard  et  al .",
    "1999 ) . in this paper",
    ", we present _ absorption - line _ kinematic results for galaxies in the deep sample . over the next few years",
    ", this sample will increase dramatically . throughout this paper",
    "we use a cosmology of h@xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the photometric observations consist of hst @xmath10 and @xmath11 band images , with exposure times of 2800s in f606w and 4400s in f814w .",
    "the full field contains 28 overlapping _ hst _ pointings located at approximately 1417 + 52 , called the groth survey strip .",
    "the area spans 50  by 2.5 .",
    "simard  et  al .  ( 2002 ) provide details for the reduction and photometry .",
    "the full dataset consists of 7450 galaxies with structural parameters determined from a two - dimensional bulge+disk surface brightness model ( simard  et  al .",
    "2002 ) . the data in this paper span the full angular length of the groth strip , but the density of coverage is not complete .",
    "we obtained spectroscopic observations over several years , from 1995 to 2000 , on the keck telescope using the low resolution imaging spectrograph , lris ( oke  et  al .",
    "two gratings were used to obtain large wavelength coverage : a blue side , which ranges roughly from 4500    to 6500   , and a red side , ranging from 6000    to 9500   .",
    "the exact wavelength range depends on the slit s position in the mask . for the blue side ,",
    "the spectral scale is 0.84  pix@xmath12 , and for the red side it is 1.2  pix@xmath12 .",
    "the spatial scale for both is 0.215  pix@xmath12 .",
    "both the slit width and the seeing are typically 1 .",
    "the spectroscopic reduction follows a pipeline procedure described in weiner  et  al .",
    "we combine all spectra for a particular galaxy ; in some cases we combined spectra taken as much as five years apart . typically , the early - type galaxies appeared on several mask designs since we desired higher signal - to - noise ( s / n ) for absorption - line dispersions .",
    "the number of individual exposures ranges from two to fifteen , with total exposure times ranging from 35 to 310 minutes .",
    "table  1 presents the galaxy sample , along with the exposure times .",
    "there are three selection steps that determine the final sample .",
    "these are the galaxy identifications from the _ hst _ image , the spectroscopic selection from that sample , and finally the selection of galaxies from the spectroscopic sample that go into this analysis .",
    "the photometric selection of the galaxies is described in detail in simard  et  al .",
    "for the analysis in this paper , this selection effect is negligible since there are no photometric biases down to @xmath13 , and our faintest galaxy is @xmath14 .",
    "the original spectroscopic sample consists of 648 galaxies .",
    "it is magnitude - limited with @xmath15 as galaxy candidates . in order to provide dense spatial coverage of the gss fields",
    ", we used many different mask designs per field .",
    "we have obtained spectra in 25 of the 28 gss fields , but in each field the completeness varies significantly . in some of the fields , we have spectra for all @xmath15 galaxies , while in others",
    "the fraction observed is below 20% .",
    "the selection criteria for the absorption - line studies depend only on s / n and the presence of absorption - lines ; we measure internal absorption - line kinematics for all objects with adequate signal - to - noise ( @xmath16 per pixel ) , regardless of galaxy type . since we require absorption - lines , the sample consists of predominantly early - type galaxies .",
    "i m  et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) identify early - type galaxies from the deep sample based on structural parameters ; 21 galaxies ( 58% ) from our sample are classified as early type galaxies in that paper .",
    "i m  et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) provide a detailed description of the separation into early and late type galaxies .",
    "this separation relies primarily on bulge fraction ( @xmath17 0.4 ) , smoothness and symmetry , but not color .",
    "we refer the reader to that work for more information on the classification system .",
    "the remaining 15 galaxies in our sample ( 42% ) are likely disk galaxies , but we measure them anyway ; their results will be discussed separately .",
    "i m  et  al .",
    "have an additional 22 galaxies which we do not include since they are either too faint or have absorption lines that fall into unusable spectral regions due to strong night sky emission .",
    "koo  et  al .  ( 2003 ) study bulge properties of the deep sample and include all of our galaxies .",
    "figure  1 presents true color images for the whole sample . in the following ,",
    "we make a clear distinction between early - types and disk - dominated systems , and we will discuss each separately .    of the three selection effects  the original photometric sample selection , spectroscopic selection , and absorption line selection effect  the ability to measure absorption lines causes the most severe constraint .",
    "the photometric catalogue contains every galaxy observed with _ hst _ in the f814w and f606w filters down to @xmath18=24 and @xmath19=25 .",
    "since our faintest galaxy in the fp sample is @xmath14 , the photometric selection causes no bias ( for further description of the photometric selection function , see simard  et  al .",
    "2002 ) . since",
    "our faintest galaxy is relatively bright compared to the total spectroscopic sample , the spectroscopic selection function also has little effect on the overall selection function .",
    "koo  et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) discuss the selection function for bulges ( which include the galaxies in this sample ) and find that the most important effect is the magnitude of the bulge ; i.e. , size , bulge - to - total ratio , and color have small effect on the spectroscopic selection function at our magnitude limit of @xmath14 .",
    "thus , by far , the most important selection effect is the ability to measure dispersions from the absorption lines .",
    "we find that this selection does not bias our results , as discussed in  3 .    -30pt",

    "the details of this fit are in simard  et  al .",
    "our galaxies span a range of types ; we place them on the fundamental plane by using half - light properties instead of bulge - fit properties .",
    "all plots below use the half - light radii and surface brightness .",
    "we discuss the changes when using the bulge properties as well .",
    "local fp studies use pure r@xmath20 fits to estimate the total light and half - light radii . for the early - type galaxies in our sample , we perform both disk / bulge and pure bulge fits .",
    "the two properties that go into the fp are the surface brightness and half - light radius .",
    "the root - mean - squared ( rms ) difference in surface brightness between the two fits is 0.4 magnitudes .",
    "however , the important property for the fp is the change in surface brightness relative to the change in the half light radius . by plotting these two parameters on orthogonal axes",
    "we minimize the uncertainties due to different photometric models .",
    "kelson  et  al .",
    "( 2000a ) discuss this effect in detail and find that various photometric fits have little effect on the fp , since differences are manifested by moving along the plane instead of perpendicular to it . for our sample , the rms differences perpendicular to the fp using the two methods is only 0.02 magnitudes .",
    "this small amount is larger than most of our individual uncertainties , and thus is insignificant .",
    "since the disk / bulge decomposition offer superior fits , we only use those results for our analysis .",
    "the two - dimensional fitting provides structural parameters defined along the major axis ; thus , half - light radii are along the semi - major axes of the galaxies .",
    "local samples generally use parameters defined in circular annuli , or use geometric mean radii . in order to compare properly to local samples",
    ", we must convert our major - axis radii and surface - brightnesses to those defined according to circular annuli .",
    "this conversion is particularly important for elongated objects and those galaxies which have disk / bulge components that are not at the same position angle , since in the latter case , major - axis half - light radii are not well defined , whereas circular aperture radii are .",
    "we integrate the disk / bulge model in circular annuli to the radius that contains half of the light , setting the average effective surface brightness , sb@xmath21 , equal to l@xmath22 .",
    "the local samples for early - type galaxies come from jrgensen  et  al.(1994 ) , faber  et  al .",
    "( 1989 ) , and bernardi  et  al .",
    "these samples use circular or geometric mean apertures .",
    "the difference between geometric mean and circular radii are insignificant for our purposes .",
    "we calculate k - corrections using an analytical formula derived from local galaxy spectra .",
    "this estimate is discussed in the appendix .",
    "we have compared these corrections to those determined from the stellar population models of bruzual & charlot ( 1998 ) and find little difference .",
    "since most of our galaxies are at redshifts between 0.7 to 1.0 and observed in @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the k - corrections do not vary much in terms of rest frame @xmath3 color ; at @xmath0=0.8 , the observed @xmath23 translates well into @xmath3 .",

    "all rest - frame quantities use h@xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we use combined , spatially - integrated line profiles to measure the kinematics . in only a handful of cases",
    "are we able to measure spatially resolved kinematics .",
    "the wavelength region used in the analysis varies dramatically due to the redshift range of the galaxies and the placement of the spectra relative to the night - sky lines , which pose a particularly difficult problem for measuring absorption - line kinematics .",
    "table  2 and figure  2 present the wavelength region used for each galaxy .",
    "locally , velocity dispersion estimates rely on the g - band region ( @xmath25 4300 ) , mg triplet lines ( @xmath25 5167,5173,5184 ) , and the ca ii triplet ( @xmath25 8498,8542,8662 ) . at redshifts greater than 0.7 ,",
    "the g - band and mg lines are pushed into the night - sky forest , and the ca triplet goes into the infrared region . since high - resolution multi - object near - infrared spectrographs do not readily exist , we are forced to rely on spectral regions where optical spectrographs are efficient , i.e. , the h+k region .",
    "this region historically has not been used much for velocity dispersions since the lines are intrinsically broadened and suffer from template mismatch more than in other spectral regions . in addition , if the spectrum contains a significant amount of a - stars , then the high stellar rotation in a - stars might complicate the interpretation of the measured dispersion .",
    "however , the recent study of kobulnicky  & gebhardt ( 2000 ) demonstrates that , with care in choosing stellar templates , the h+k region can be used to measure the internal motions of the galaxy . using a local sample of late - type galaxies ,",
    "this study compared the 20% line widths measured from the h+k region with those from hi velocity maps . to within 20% of the hi value , all galaxies in their sample compare favorably .",
    "the concordance was even better for the earlier - type galaxies ; the mix of stellar populations in late - type galaxies complicates the analysis , compared to the relatively uniform population in early - types . because we are studying mainly early - type galaxies , our situation is promising",
    "however , we still need to determine the template population carefully for each galaxy ( see below ) .    obtaining internal kinematic information",
    "requires a deconvolution of the observed galaxy spectrum with a representative set of template stellar spectra .",
    "both the deconvolution process and the template library are significant issues . for deconvolution",
    ", we treat each spectrum using two different techniques : a maximum - penalized likelihood ( mpl ) estimate that obtains a non - parametric line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) , and a maximum likelihood estimate of the best - fit gaussian losvd .",
    "both estimates use a similar fitting procedure .",
    "the programs proceed as follows : we choose an initial velocity profile , either in bins for mpl or an analytic gaussian distribution .",
    "we convolve this profile with a weighted - averaged template ( discussed below ) and calculate the residuals to the galaxy spectrum .",
    "the program varies the velocity profile parameters  bin heights or gaussian @xmath26s  and the template weights to provide the best match to the galaxy spectrum .",
    "the mpl technique is similar to that used in saha  & williams ( 1994 ) and merritt ( 1997 ) .",
    "however , the difference is due to the simultaneous fitting of the velocity profile and template weights .",
    "this fitting is essential since the template profiles vary greatly in the h+k region , reflecting the relative amount of old and young - star light .",
    "in fact , due to the large variation among spectral types , the h+k region becomes an excellent probe for disentangling the spectral make - up from the internal kinematics .",
    "for the parametric estimate , we also include a gauss - hermite polynomial fit ( van  der  marel  & franx 1993 ) using the first four parameters@xmath27 and @xmath28 ( similar to skewness and kurtosis)in addition to the velocity centroid and dispersion .",
    "we find no significant differences between the gaussian fits compared to the fits with additional moments , likely due to the low signal - to - noise in the spectra .",
    "we report only the results for the gaussian fits .",
    "the other important issue is the correct template .",
    "ideally , one observes the template library through the same set - up as the galaxy data , as is generally done for local analysis .",
    "however , for redshifted data , it is not possible to obtain individual stellar spectra covering the same rest - frame wavelengths and spectral setup .",
    "we must use either synthetic spectra or spectra taken through other spectroscopic configurations , and transform these to our system .",
    "we use templates from two sources : the coud feed spectral library at kpno ( leitherer  et  al .",
    "1996 ) , and the stellar templates observed by kobulnicky  & gebhardt ( 2000 ) .",
    "the kpno library consists of 684 stars having a broad range of spectral types , with 1.8  fwhm resolution .",
    "we select a subsample of 21 stars representing a main - sequence through k giant stars .",
    "this subsample provides good overall type coverage without requiring an extensive number of stars .",
    "the study of kobulnicky  & gebhardt uses only 12 stars  covering a similar spectral range , but has higher resolution of 1.2    fwhm .",
    "template and galaxy spectra are continuum - divided .",
    "the continuum division alleviates the need for accurate flux calibration .",
    "we use a local continuum for the estimate as opposed to a global @xmath29-parameter fit to the full spectrum .",
    "the continuum estimate relies on binned windows from which we measure a robust mean ( the biweight , see beers , flynn , & gebhardt 1990 ) from the highest 1/3 of the points ( in order to exclude absorption lines ) , and then interpolate between these mean values .",
    "we have tried a variety of continuum estimates ( in terms of number of local windows and number of points used in the local averaging ) and find insignificant differences in the kinematic results .",
    "we then transform each template to the resolution and redshift of each galaxy spectrum .",
    "the resolution depends on the individual slitlet ( variation in the milling of the mask can cause slight variations of the slit width and smoothness of cut ) and also on the wavelength ( in particular , the ends of the wavelength coverage have worse resolution ) ; we measure the spectral resolution locally for each galaxy in order to perform a proper kinematic analysis .",
    "the night - sky lines provide the local resolution . at red wavelengths ,",
    "the numerous sky lines require multi - line fitting , with multi - line gauss - hermite fits on spectral windows of 50    each .",
    "the relative positions of the lines were determined from high signal - to - noise , high - resolution spectra ( osterbrock 1997 ) .",
    "the fits produce the instrumental resolution at each wavelength interval , and we choose that resolution appropriate for the position of the usable features in the galaxy spectrum .",
    "for the blue wavelengths ( 4000 - 6000  ) , there are only a few night - sky lines , forcing us to use an average resolution for the entire range .",
    "the instrumental profile is well represented by a gaussian distribution plus a slightly negative tail component .",
    "we make no correction for effects from either slit illumination or slit width ; however , since the seeing is typically larger than our slits and the observed galaxy dispersions are larger than the instrumental width , these effects are minimal .",
    "having determined the appropriate spectral resolution , we then redshift the template and convolve to this resolution . redshifting",
    "the template causes the spectral resolution to decrease by 1+@xmath0 , and this must be included when calculating the convolution .",
    "we convolve using a gauss - hermite polynomial with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 is the resolution for the galaxy spectrum ( measured from the sky lines ) , @xmath33 is that of the templates , either 0.9    for the kpno library or 0.51    for the kobulnicky  & gebhardt sample , and @xmath28 represent the negative tail of lris .",
    "since the template sample is larger for the kpno library , we prefer those .",
    "however , for the most distant galaxies , the spectral resolution for the kpno sample is too low  due the broadening from 1+@xmath0and we are forced to use the better resolution kobulnicky - gebhardt sample .",
    "table  2 and figure 1 present the template library used for each galaxy .",
    "alternatively , we could broaden the galaxy spectrum slightly to match the redshifted kpno templates ; we prefer not to do this since many of the galaxies have small velocity dispersions , and we want to optimize the signal .",
    "we have analyzed many of the galaxies using both template libraries and find no significant differences .",
    "figure  2 shows the spectra for a sample of the galaxies , and the gauss - hermite fit convolved with the template .",
    "a handful of galaxies contain both the h+k region and the g - band region . for these",
    ", we have measured the internal kinematics separately over those regions .",
    "figure  3 plots the dispersion measured from g - band region ( we used 4150 4430 ) versus h+k region ( 3850 4150 ) .",
    "good agreement is obtained , with dispersions derived from the h+k region on average only 4(@xmath34)% smaller than the dispersion measured in th g - band .",
    "furthermore , figure  3 contains galaxies where the h+k dispersion estimate comes from the blue spectrum and the g - band estimate is from the red spectrum .",
    "the concordance of the two implies that the relative calibration of the instrumental profile is correct .",
    "we use monte carlo simulations to measure the uncertainties on the dispersions . for each realization",
    ", we generate a simulated galaxy spectrum based on the best - fit velocity profile and an estimate of the root - mean - square ( rms ) of the initial fit .",
    "table  2 presents the signal - to - noise per pixel for each of the galaxies .",
    "the initial galaxy spectrum comes from the best - fitting template convolved with the measured losvd .",
    "this provides a galaxy spectrum with essentially zero noise ( the noise in the template is insignificant ) , plotted as the red smooth line in figure .  2 .",
    "from that initial spectrum , we then generate 100 realizations and determine the velocity profile , and hence the velocity dispersion , each time .",
    "each realization contains flux values at each wavelength position randomly chosen from a gaussian distribution , with the mean given by the initial galaxy spectrum and the standard deviation given by the rms of the initial fit .",
    "the 100 realizations of the velocity profiles provide a distribution of values from which we estimate the 68% confidence bands .",
    "0.3 cm    besides the dispersion uncertainty , an important aspect of the simulations is to determine the measured bias . often , and especially in low s",
    "/ n data , the measurement technique itself may bias the parameter value . the best way to study",
    "this is to examine the distribution of values in the monte carlo simulation . in every case ,",
    "the bias in the dispersion is much smaller than the uncertainty and the average bias is zero .",
    "the monte carlo procedure incorporates the major sources of uncertainty in this analysis , namely , the broadened lines of the h+k region , the variable template mix , and low s / n .",
    "thus we are confident that our dispersion estimates are unbiased .",
    "furthermore , we have run all following analyses using a strict cut of better than 15% accuracy on the dispersion measurements .",
    "this cut leaves 14 galaxies in the sample , and we find no differences in the results versus using the full sample .",
    "the relative uncertainty for the velocity dispersion scales roughly linearly as the s / n .",
    "a s / n of 5 per pixel ( the lowest in the sample ) implies an uncertainty around 40% and a s / n of 25 per pixel ( the highest ) implies an uncertainty around 5% .",
    "we have one galaxy in common with a previous measurement .",
    "the quad - lens galaxy , 093_2470 ( hst14176 + 522 ) , has a measured dispersion of @xmath35 km / s by ohyama et al .",
    "our measured value is @xmath36 , which is barely consistent with the previous measurement .",
    "this galaxy spectrum has the highest signal - to - noise ratio in our whole sample , and thus the best measured dispersion .",
    "we have thoroughly checked systematic issues by changing the spectral fitting range ( h+k only , g - band region only , and full spectrum ) and the used templates .",
    "we find differences consistent within our quoted uncertainty . given that our spectrum has higher s / n than that of ohyama et al . , we choose to use our measurement .    0.3 cm    0.3 cm      since the velocity dispersion may vary with radius in galaxies , and since we are using spectra extracted from different physical sizes , we must correct the velocity dispersion to a common radius .",
    "the local analysis of jrgensen  et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) corrects to an aperture of radius 3.4  at the coma distance , and we adopt that value .",
    "we determine the aperture correction for each galaxy individually using its brightness profile and redshift .",
    "however , the radial profile for the velocity dispersion is unknown , and we have to approximate this variation .",
    "we use the local samples of gonzlez ( 1993 ) and ziegler & bender ( 1997 ) to determine a characteristic gradient in the dispersion profile .",
    "gonzlez s data extend from r=0r@xmath21 , while ziegler  & bender s data extend much further out to 3  r@xmath21 .",
    "the variation seen inside r@xmath21 is the same , namely , the variation is represented by a power - law with exponents ranging from 0.1 to 0 . at radii beyond r@xmath21 the profile becomes shallower , represented by log  @xmath37 ( ziegler & bender 1997 ) , but there is a large variation of the slope .",
    "there appears to be no obvious trend between the dispersion profile with any other galaxy property , so we must use average values for our sample .",

    "thus , even though the comparison between our sample and that of van  dokkum  et  al.appears to be insignificant , the consequences extrapolating to redshifts near one are important .",

    "both groups find a similar offset .",
    "ironically , the offset for this galaxy lies exactly in between the average offsets for our sample and van  dokkum & ellis ( 2003 ) .",
    "thus , there are no obvious reasons for the differences from the analysis techniques .",
    "we conclude that the major difference is likely due to sample selection .",
    "in fact , van  dokkum & franx ( 2001 ) argue that their fp sample is likely biased due to what they call `` progenitor bias '' , causing their galaxies to not be a fair representation of galaxies today . the main effect of the `` progenitor bias '' would be to cause the observed fp magnitude offset to be less than it actually is since one would be looking at the reddest , most evolved systems .",
    "our selection criteria is mainly based on bulge fraction and therefore may be a more fair representation of local ellipticals .",
    "two of the nine galaxies in van  dokkum & ellis ( 2003 ) have similar magnitude offsets as we measure .",
    "including the van dokkum & ellis objects with ours would substantially increase the intrinsic scatter of the fp .",
    "clearly , studies with larger samples and well - defined selection effects are needed .",
    "colors provide additional insight into galaxy evolutionary history , since changes in the stellar population affect both total brightness and color .",
    "however , it is difficult to compare colors of galaxies observed at different redshifts since all data must be transformed to a common photometric system , requiring accurate spectral energy distributions ( sed s ) for all galaxy types .",
    "furthermore , at redshifts beyond @xmath51 , the observed @xmath10 represents rest - frame @xmath40 magnitude , for which we do not have large local samples for comparison .",
    "thus to use color information , the two main obstacles are obtaining both accurate transformations to a local rest - frame color and an accurate local galaxy color distribution .",
    "accurate color transformations are best determined using actual galaxy spectra .",
    "spectral synthesis models do not reflect the wide variation seen in local galaxies , and specifically they do not include dust effects . since our observed bands are @xmath10 and @xmath11 at redshifts from 0.3 to 1 , we must include uv , as well as optical , spectra for the local samples . in the appendix",
    "we describe rest - frame color estimates and k - corrections .",

    "we choose those with t - type less than 0 and @xmath3 uncertainty less than 0.1 magnitude , yielding 290 early - type galaxies .",
    "additionally , since the color of the galaxy depends on its magnitude , we must check that the absolute magnitudes of both samples ( distant and local ) are consistent . the absolute magnitude range for the distant early - type sample is @xmath60 ; however the proper local comparison should include the magnitude dimming .",
    "thus , the range that we select from the local sample is @xmath61 .",
    "this cut leaves 219 local galaxies .",
    "including the brighter objects would not change the results significantly since the local @xmath3 distribution for all early - types is quite narrow .",
    "the mean @xmath3 for local early - types is 0.52 , using either the full sample or the magnitude cut .",
    "using an extreme cut on t - type less than 3 produces only a slightly redder @xmath3 of 0.55 .",
    "another important point is to consider possible differences between field and cluster galaxies , since our sample comes from the field . again",

    "a histogram represents the most basic and coarse approximation to a density distribution .",

    "complications arise due to the uncertainty in knowing which galaxy property in the fp is changing with time .",
    "another source of confusion is that dust properties may change with time , and their effects should be included .    both size and velocity dispersion may evolve and affect the distribution in the fundamental plane .",
    "a full treatment of the size and dispersion distribution requires detailed modeling of the selection functions and will not be explored here . however , the most straightforward interpretation of luminosity evolution measured by i m et al .",
    "( 2002 ) is that of stellar - population evolution only . furthermore , preliminary analysis using a similar study to that in i m et al . for the luminosity evolution",
    "shows little evolution in the size function .",

    "this dispersion offset implies a change of only 0.16 magnitudes in surface brightness .",

    "homologous merger models for such cases predict very little change in sigma but a doubling of the radius ( for equal - mass mergers ) . in general",
    ", radius will grow in proportion to mass , with sigma staying constant .",
    "since local galaxies show that surface brightness goes inversely with radius , the effect of mergers on the fundamental plane is to move galaxies along rather than away from it .",

    ". metallicities in between these values span the curves shown in fig .",
    "the problem is to reconcile the local red colors ( around @xmath3 = 0.52 ) with the similarly red colors ( around 0.34 ) seen in distant galaxies that have over two magnitudes of brightening .",
    "two plausible scenarios are population changes over time and changes in dust contribution over time .",
    "dust provides the mechanism to make galaxies redder at high redshift if the dust is more significant in the past . we know for local early - type galaxies that dust does have appreciable effects ( falco  et  al .",
    "1999 and goudfrooij  & de  jong 1995 ) . however , the amount of dust required at high redshift to explain the color change would cause us to notice its effect when looking at galaxies at different inclinations .",
    "koo  et  al .  (",
    "2003 ) find consistent magnitudes and colors among their bulge samples between the edge - on and face - on samples .",
    "thus , we conclude that dust should not be a major contribution to the reddening of these galaxies . furthermore ,",
    "if dust were more prevalent at high redshifts , then the galaxies would appear both redder and fainter .",
    "dust would help to alleviate the problem with having very red galaxies at high redshift , but it would cause the galaxies to have an even more extreme magnitude brightening which would push make the single - burst formation epoch of @xmath1 to even later times .",
    "an alternative approach is to invoke a changing stellar population .",
    "the ways to do this include allowing for a contamination from stars with different metallicities , different ages , or a combination of both .",
    "either of these models can be made to work ; however , in both , the underlying requirement is to have galaxies that contain very red colors at high - redshift . the only way to do this is to have an extreme high - metallicity base component , or make the universe old enough that stars have the time to redden as they age . since we have some basic constraints on the age of the universe from many cosmological studies , and age constraints on local ellipticals ( see trager  et  al .",
    "2000 for the most recent analysis ) , we are forced to use stars with high - metallicity to explain the red colors .",
    "thus , we always start with a base population that has 2.5 times solar metallicity .",
    "models by either bruzual & charlot ( 1998 ) or worthey ( 1994 ) produce similar results .",
    "one model includes accretion from a low metallicity component . as seen in fig .",
    "10 , low metallicity stars have a bluer color , and thus their addition would serve to make the population bluer .",
    "an acceptable accretion model ( i.e. , one that maintains constant @xmath3 ) includes accreting stars with 1/50th solar metals that are the same age as the base galaxy .",
    "the accretion is constant during the time when the galaxy aged from 1 - 3 gyrs , and the total mass accreted is 10%",
    ". other models with different accretion histories will also work , but the main requirement is that the accreted material have very low metals if one uses the same age for both the base and the accreted material .",
    "unfortunately , it seems unreasonable to require the accreted material to have such low metallicity when the base galaxy s is so high .",
    "we therefore turn to star formation as a possible mechanism .    as stars age they become redder .",
    "thus , if we were to include stars with younger ages , these blue stars would serve to make the whole population bluer .",
    "we then simply adjust the amount of new stars to make a null color change . the green line in fig .",
    "10 shows such a model .",
    "the base population consists of stars with 2.5 times solar metals ( the upper black line in the figure ) that are 10 gyr old today .",
    "an exponentially declining star formation history provides the necessary young stars to maintain constant color over time .",
    "the new stars have solar metallicity , and the parameters are such that the contribution today from the new stars is 7% by mass and the e - folding time for their formation is 5 gyr . keep in mind that most of the stars are formed at early times ; the age weighted by the @xmath24 light is 7.9 gyr and weighted by the @xmath40 light is 5.7 gyr , compared to the age of the base population of 10 gyr .",
    "these assumptions imply an intermediate mass for the new population since we are making new stars from solar - metallicity gas .",
    "lower metals , being bluer , would require a smaller amount of new stars ; similarly , stars from higher metals would require more new stars .",
    "thus , if we use 2.5 times solar metals , we find that 10% of the total mass must be in new stars ( with average ages of 8.1 gyr for the @xmath24 light and 6.2 gyr for the @xmath40 light ) , and using 1/5 solar metals requires only 4% of the total mass .",
    "any metallicity can trace a nearly identical curve in fig .",
    "10 solely by adjusting the fractional contribution of the new component .",
    "thus , given the large degeneracies and limited size of the present data , we will not explore this further .",
    "however , for any metallicity the common requirements are : 1 ) the base component must have high metals ( 2.5 times solar ) otherwise we can not achieve red enough colors at early times ; 2 ) the star formation rate must be peaked at early times , otherwise the constancy of @xmath3 can not be maintained ; and 3 ) the amount of late forming stars can not exceed 10% .",
    "the conclusion of 2 ) above is largely independent of the stellar population model since it results from a differential measurement .",
    "however , 1 ) and 3 ) rely on good calibration of the stellar population models in an absolute sense in the ultraviolet region , which is not very well tested .",
    "the fact that the two sets of models  bruzual & charlot and worthey  give similar results provides some comfort that the stellar population models are accurate .",
    "local studies provide some insight into whether the above star formation history is correct .",
    "trager  et  al .",
    "( 2000a and 2000b ) investigate local field early - type galaxies to infer their stellar population histories using structural and spectral parameters .",
    "they find that local field ellipticals span a large range in luminosity - weighted ages , with a slight tendency for lower - dispersion galaxies to be younger .",
    "furthermore , their best model suggests that galaxies are made up of an older single stellar population with a contribution from younger stars .",
    "this younger population appears to come from pre - enriched gas rather than low - metallicity gas . while this scenario is similar to our picture ,",
    "the details differ , mainly in regards to the metallicity of the base component .",
    "a second issue is the @xmath40-band color , which has not yet been properly calibrated of non - solar abundances ratios .",
    "the high metallicity  around 2.5 solar  required to achieve the very red colors at early times here appears to be too high for the integrated metallicities measured for local samples  generally from 1 to 1.5 solar .",
    "resolution of this difference may lie in a variety of places but possibly in the stellar population models . at redshifts near 1",
    ", we are seeing galaxies as young as or younger than 2 gyr .",
    "these young ages pose a particularly challenging task for stellar population models since the stellar properties change rapidly during these times , and one has to be careful about the input initial mass function , burst length , and many other details which change depending on which model is used .",
    "broadhurst & bouwens ( 2000 ) demonstrate how changing the imf can cause very red colors for young galaxies  although at the expense of a very truncated imf .",
    "as the data increase and stellar population models at young ages become more sophisticated , we will be in a good position to re - examine these issues .",
    "we can compare the above model of the star formation history for field early - types to the model of van  dokkum & franx ( 2001 ) for cluster galaxies .",
    "they attempted to explain a similar problem that we have : high redshift galaxies in clusters tend to have too large a magnitude evolution for their constant , red colors .",
    "an additional problem is that the spread of cluster colors is very small , too small to be consistent with the cluster spread seen locally .",
    "van  dokkum & franx invoke a model based on `` progenitor bias '' in which the galaxies in their fp sample at high redshift do not represent the bulk of local cluster galaxies today .",
    "the galaxies that we observe in clusters today have undergone significant evolution  from spirals to ellipticals during merging  such that at redshifts near one , they are not included in early type galaxies samples .",
    "thus , the color spread seen in high redshift ellipticals does not represent these today since they represent only the oldest galaxies . including the colors of the progenitor spirals in the sample will increase the scatter and better match the scatter seen in nearby cluster ellipticals .",
    "the consequence is that when an elliptical is formed , it appears as a red galaxy since the stars in the progenitor spirals are all formed at very high redshifts ( @xmath66 ) . in their model ,",
    "van  dokkum & franx do not need to invoke a changing stellar population to maintain a low scatter in the galaxy colors . in order to explain their data",
    ", they suggest that 50% of the early - type galaxies in clusters are formed _",
    "after _ a redshift of one .",
    "if this model were also true for the field sample , this large fraction of ellipticals would be seen in the evolution of the luminosity function .",
    "i m  et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) measure essentially no change in the number density of field ellipticals out to a redshift of one .",
    "their results exclude an increase in field ellipticals of 50% from @xmath50 to today by high significance ( 97% ) .",
    "thus , we can not make the cluster model of van  dokkum & franx work for our sample .",
    "we find that the field ellipticals have formation epochs at redshifts less than 2 , and likely around 1.5 .",
    "the oldest cluster ellipticals that are fully formed by @xmath50 have formation epochs @xmath67 .",
    "the age difference is around 2gyr .",
    "we can see if this age difference is possible from studies that compare local field and cluster ellipticals .",
    "the most complete study comes from bernardi  et  al.(1998 ) .",
    "based on analysis of the mg@xmath26 correlation , they find little age difference between the field and cluster galaxies .",
    "they suggest that field galaxies are on average @xmath68 gyr younger than cluster galaxies . however , as is shown by trager et al .",
    "( 2000a ) , the mg@xmath26 correlation is a composite of both age and metallicity trends .",
    "thus , it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions so far about the local population .",
    "another difficulty in constraining age differences is that as a galaxy ages , the rate at which it fades slows down .",
    "thus , age differences between two old galaxies ( like those seen today ) have a more subtle effect than in young galaxies ( such as at redshifts near one ) .",
    "furthermore , the bernardi et al .",
    "cluster comparison sample represents the most extreme forms of overdensities ; i.e. , they are some of the largest clusters ever observed .",
    "thus , if the galaxy formation epoch relates to the local density , then the high redshift cluster / field comparison is biased compared to the same at low redshift , where we have included a much larger range of cluster sizes",
    ". therefore , age differences between the high redshift cluster / field sample are likely to be larger than those seen at low redshift .",
    "0.3 cm 0.3 cm      we can also use the stellar templates that the spectral fitting process chooses as probes of galaxy age .",
    "many galaxies have spectra covering regions from restframe 2500    to 6000   .",
    "these regions include balmer lines , which are good age indicators .",
    "figure  2 and table  2 contain the relative fractions of stellar types .",
    "we divide the template contributions into three bins by adding up the similar stellar types in the two different sets of libraries .",
    "the three bins include a stars , f ",
    "g dwarfs , and g  k giants .",
    "we plot the fraction of giant stars against the magnitude offset from the fundamental plane in figure  11 .",
    "there is a dramatic decrease of giant star contribution for galaxies with larger magnitude offsets .",
    "this decrease corresponds to an increase in the contribution of younger stars ( the a - g dwarfs ) .",
    "we find no significant trends between the a or f ",
    "this trend is obvious from inspection of the spectra . for those galaxies with large contribution from young stars , we notice strong balmer lines which are absent in those galaxies dominated by giant star spectra .",
    "we could use the relative contribution as an age indicator , similar to what we did for the magnitude offset and color change in figure  10 ; however , a full treatment will have to wait until the stellar population models have been scrutinized in the h+k region and the sample size increases , since there is considerable noise in the estimate of the stellar makeup . in any event ,",
    "the correlation in fig .",
    "11 suggests that larger magnitude offsets indicate younger stellar systems .",
    "we have checked whether the correlation seen in fig .",
    "11 results from a stars having broader lines in the h+k region .",
    "if , for example , the fitting algorithm chooses a stars for a template as opposed to a giant star , then the implied velocity dispersion would be smaller using the a templates .",
    "this decrease in the width would cause a larger offset from the fp , which could lead to the correlation in fig .",
    "11 . however , for those galaxies with low velocity dispersions , we have re - measured dispersions using subsets of templates from a stars to giant stars .",
    "we find little difference in the galaxy velocity dispersion .",
    "furthermore , the line ratios change dramatically from a dwarfs to k giants .",
    "the fitting algorithm naturally takes this into account when it chooses which stars provide the best fit .    many a stars are rotationally broadened and we must consider whether this impacts our measured dispersions .",
    "the study of hubrig  et  al.(2000 ) presents the distribution of @xmath69 for both young and old stars .",
    "the peak of the distribution for both the old and young a - stars is around 100  km  s@xmath12 , with a tail up to 250  km  s@xmath12 .",
    "if the galaxy light is dominated by fast - rotating a stars and we do not include this in the analysis , then we may overestimate the velocity dispersion .",
    "alternatively , we could underestimate the dispersion if our template a star has systematically higher rotation .",
    "neither of these are important for our results .",
    "the @xmath69 for our template stars are all less than 60  km  s@xmath12",
    ". however , some of our galaxies are dominated by a stars .",
    "we can estimate the effect on the dispersion from the @xmath69 distribution . for a star rotating at 100  km  s@xmath12",
    ", the fwhm of a balmer line will be around that value and most likely smaller depending on the amount of limb darkening .",
    "thus , the dispersion due to rotation is around 40  km  s@xmath12 .",
    "since all of the measured galaxy dispersions are over 100  km  s@xmath12 , even if the galaxy is completely dominated by a stars , the effect will be minimal . in order for the a star rotation to have",
    "a significant impact on the galaxy , _ all _ of the a stars in the galaxy would have to have rotations that are at the extreme maximum of the known distribution .",
    "this is unlikely and we conclude that rotation of the a stars is insignificant for our purposes .",
    "one of the primary issues that arise when comparing redshifted samples to local samples is whether we are looking at the same objects .",
    "the local fundamental plane sample is comprised primarily of at least spheroidal or early - type galaxies .",
    "we have been careful in our analysis to highlight galaxies classified as early - type ( 58% percent of our sample ) ; however there is uncertainty in this classification system . to estimate the effect of this concern",
    ", we can use the location in the fundamental plane of the disk - dominated galaxies .",
    "the 15 disk - dominated galaxies provide very similar magnitude offsets and colors as the 21 early - types .",
    "thus , if we blindly compare these distant , disk - dominated galaxies to the local early - type population , we would arrive at similar conclusions . as seen in fig .  5 , non",
    "- spheroidal galaxies have a slightly larger scatter at a given redshift , but on average they follow the same magnitude evolution . from fig .  9",
    ", we see that the late - type galaxies ( those that have bulge fractions less than 0.4 and tend to show spiral structure ) tend to have very slightly less luminosity evolution , suggesting that there is at most a small bias . therefore ,",
    "even if our classification system includes some galaxies that would not be included locally , the results would be unchanged .",
    "a further complication in terms of the sample properties is that we are using total galaxy properties instead of bulge properties , which are likely to be more appropriate for fp studies .",
    "koo  et  al .  ( 2003 ) present a detailed analysis of bulge properties for a large sample of objects that includes many of our galaxies .",
    "we refer to that paper for a detailed discussion of bulge properties .",
    "since we can not separate the velocity dispersion into contributions from the bulge and disk light , we simply use total galaxy properties .",
    "however , even for local fundamental plane studies , this decomposition is not used , implying that our distant early - type sample should provide the best comparison .",
    "the large magnitude offsets from the fundamental plane are much larger than any of our systematic effects , and are thus real .",
    "the relevant parameters are @xmath26 , r@xmath21 , and surface brightness .",
    "aperture errors in surface brightness are at most 10% , which implies 0.10 magnitudes .",
    "systematic errors in r@xmath21 are less than 10% as well . however , by plotting the combination of log  r@xmath21 and log  sb used here , the systematic errors are greatly reduced since the two parameters are correlated .",
    "kelson  et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) estimate that their systematic errors on the fp offset from r@xmath21 and surface brightness is less than 3% at @xmath70 .",
    "systematic errors in @xmath26 are likely to be less than 15% , or 0.2 magnitudes in surface brightness .",
    "thus , the largest uncertainties come from the measurement of @xmath26 , and these are much smaller than the @xmath712 magnitude differences seen in figure  5 .",
    "kochanek  et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) and rusin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) use strong gravitational lensing from the castles project to infer the velocity dispersion of field lensing galaxies , and , hence , measure their location in the fundamental plane . van de ven et al .",

    "rusin et al .",

    "we measure a velocity dispersion of 202  km  s@xmath12 , while their dispersion is 275  km  s@xmath12 , which is reflected in the difference in magnitude brightening .",
    "kochanek et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have four other galaxies ( with redshift below 0.4 ) with both spectroscopic and lens velocity dispersions ; they find agreement between the two estimates .",
    "thus , it is not clear what the reasons are for the differences . however , the dispersion difference for 093_2470 is real , and the next step is to include a larger sample of high - redshift comparison objects . the re - analysis by van de ven et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggests even less of a difference between our results and the lensing results .",
    "they estimate a mean formation redshift of @xmath72 , which is well within our range , although still at earlier redshifts than what we measure .",
    "they further conclude that the field lens galaxies are about 10 - 15% younger than the cluster galaxies .",
    "rusin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) note the difference between their fundamental plane and that of treu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) as being due to their mass - selected sample compared to the other luminosity - selected samples , but this does not explain the difference seen in the direct comparison above",
    ". however , this selection effect may be part of the answer for why there are overall differences among various fundamental plane studies .",
    "we have conducted a study of the photometric and kinematic parameters of distant early - type filed galaxies and compared to local values . assuming that radii and velocity dispersion do not evolve",
    ", we find a progressive brightening in surface brightness back in time that amounts to over two magnitudes at @xmath50 .",
    "integrated @xmath3 colors in contrast evolve much less .",
    "these findings broadly agree with published results for distant _ cluster _ early - type galaxies except that",
    "the surface - brightening effect in the field population is roughly twice as large .",
    "a consistent star - formation model that accounts for the evolution in brightness but not in color involves an early burst of metal - rich stars comprising @xmath1790% of the mass , to which a younger population comprising @xmath7310% of the mass is added later with an e - folding time of about five gyr .",
    "this model is not unique but does imply that early - type field galaxies consist mainly of old stars with a frosting of younger stars formed later .",
    "some evidence for a younger frosting has indeed been found in spectral studies of local field early - type galaxies .",
    "not answered bu this study is whether the younger stellar populations forms smoothly , as assumed here , or in bursts .",
    "also not answered is the age of the oldest stars , i.e. , the age of the initial period of intense star formation .",
    "the mean light - weighted luminosities of our field stellar populations at @xmath50 are sufficiently bright that it is possible that the formation redshift could be as low as 1.4 .",
    "if so , red galaxies should begin to disappear from the field shortly before @xmath50 .",
    "this trend should be detectable in deep k - band studies of distant field galaxies that are currently in progress and will be published soon .",
    "thus , it is possible that the long - sought transformation from blue proto - galaxies to mature red e / s0 s may shortly be detected , at least for field populations .",

    "0.3 cm -8.66 cm 9.0 cm 0.3 cm    the plots on the left side of figure  a12 are the computed rest - frame @xmath3 color against observed @xmath23 color at the redshift listed in the plot .",
    "the panels on the right - side are the @xmath24 magnitude k - corrections as a function of observed @xmath23 color . to compute k - corrections and rest - frame @xmath3 colors , we use the sed database provided by storchi - bergmann , calzetti , & kinney ( see + http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/catalogs/nearby_gal/sed.html ) , which covers 12007500    using iue and ground - based spectra for 99 galaxies , 43 of which have the full wavelength coverage .",
    "we place the specified wavelength bandpass at the appropriate location in the galaxy spectrum according to the redshift , and sum the flux .",
    "the filter curves and the @xmath10 and @xmath11 zeropoints come from the _ hst _ database . since at redshifts around 0.8 ,",
    "observed @xmath23 is similar to rest - frame @xmath3 ( except for a zeropoint shift ) , we transform all galaxies to rest - frame @xmath3 to minimize sed uncertainties .",
    "thus , from the 43 seds , we have rest - frame @xmath3 for each redshift and observed @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , we also measure the k - corrections for rest - frame @xmath24 using observed @xmath11 and @xmath23 .",
    "a polynomial fit for both estimates to the seds produces the transformation for each of our galaxies .",
    "the polynomial is as follows        figure  a12 shows the data and the polynomial fits .",
    "there is one galaxy in the sample which is an obvious outlier  shown as an open symbol , ngc  5128which is excluded from the fit . compared to the results of bruzual  & charlot ( 1998 ) models ,",
    "there is acceptable agreement , although we prefer to use the local spectra to provide the intrinsic scatter .",
    "the comparison with the local color distribution of early - type galaxies in section 3.1 uses observed values for @xmath3 , and we must make sure that our system estimated here from seds is on the same system as observed @xmath3 s .",
    "there are 15 galaxies in common between the two samples .",
    "the average @xmath3 difference between the two is @xmath76 , with the measured sed @xmath3 being redder .",
    "the quoted uncertainty is the 68% confidence band on the mean offset .",
    "a possible complication is that the aperture used for the sed @xmath3 values is not the same that used for the local sample integrated colors .",
    "the aperture used for the sed s is a @xmath77 box for both the iue and ground - based spectra . since",
    "this aperture does not encompass the full galaxy , we expect the sed colors to be slightly redder , as measured . however , the small measured difference between the two colors is consistent with zero and is furthermore small for the effects that we discuss .",

    "<S> fundamental plane studies provide an excellent means of understanding the evolutionary history of early - type galaxies . using the low resolution imaging spectrograph on the keck telescope </S>",
    "<S> , we obtained internal stellar kinematic information for 36 field galaxies in the groth strip21 early - type and 15 disk galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> their redshifts range from 0.31.0 , with a median redshift 0.8 . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the relation shows no difference compared with the local slope . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is significant evolution in the zero - point offset ; an offset due to evolution in magnitude requires a 2.4 magnitude luminosity brightening at @xmath0=1 . </S>",
    "<S> we see little differences of the offset with bulge fraction , which is a good surrogate for galaxy type . </S>",
    "<S> correcting for the luminosity evolution reduces the orthogonal scatter in the fundamental plane to 8% , consistent with the local scatter . </S>",
    "<S> this scatter is measured for our sample , and does not include results from other studies which may have different selection effects . the difference in the degree of evolution between our field sample and published cluster galaxies suggests a more recent formation epoch  around @xmath1 for field galaxies compared to @xmath2 for cluster galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude difference implies that the field early - type galaxies are about 2 gyr younger than the cluster ellipticals using standard single - burst models . </S>",
    "<S> however , the same models imply a significant change in the rest - frame @xmath3 color from then to present , which is not seen in our sample . continuous low - level star formation , however , would serve to explain the constant colors over this large magnitude change . </S>",
    "<S> a consistent model has 7% of the stellar mass created after the initial burst , using an exponentially decaying star formation rate with an e - folding time of 5 gyr . </S>"
