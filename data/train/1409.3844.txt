    "the prediction and discovery of time - reversal invariant topological band insulators  band insulators distinguished from their conventional counterparts by the existence of a bulk topological invariant and topologically protected edge or surface states , yet distinct from the time - reversal symmetry breaking quantum hall insulator  is a major breakthrough in condensed matter physics.@xcite the classification of such insulators requires only single - particle quantum mechanics , where interactions between electrons are ignored .",
    "soon after the original predictions of the quantum spin hall insulator and the three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological insulator , it was realized that this topological band theory could be directly applied to the classification of bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonians , which describe the spectrum of fermionic quasiparticles in paired superfluids and superconductors at the mean - field level .",
    "this led to the prediction of time - reversal invariant topological superfluids and superconductors.@xcite translated in the superfluid or superconducting language , the surface states of topological band insulators become majorana fermions ",
    "particles that are their own antiparticles , and which contain half the degrees of freedom of an ordinary complex fermion.@xcite under certain circumstances majorana fermions possess non - abelian statistics , which may lead to important applications in quantum information.@xcite    while the search for solid - state materials that exhibit topological superconductivity is still ongoing , a 3d topological superfluid has in principle already been found : the @xmath0 phase of superfluid @xmath1he.@xcite it was recognized early on by salomaa and volovik@xcite that the spin - triplet @xmath2-wave order parameter in the balian - werthamer ( bw ) state@xcite that describes @xmath1he-@xmath0 corresponds to a topologically nontrivial texture in momentum space , which in turn should give rise to protected fermionic zero modes at the boundary of the sample.@xcite    although the translation of topological band theory into the superfluid / superconducting context has led to remarkable predictions and insights , superfluids and superconductors remain fundamentally distinct from band insulators . while in the latter inter - particle interactions can be treated as a perturbation on top of the noninteracting band structure , the former are broken symmetry states that owe their very existence to such interactions .",
    "unlike the frozen energy gap of a band insulator , the gap in a superfluid or superconductor originates from a dynamical order parameter that fluctuates even at zero temperature .    in this work ,",
    "we go beyond the pure bdg description of topological superfluids that has been the focus of much work in this field to date , and explore the consequences of bulk order parameter fluctuations in the only known 3d topological superfluid , @xmath1he-@xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the question of how the properties of the majorana surface states in @xmath1he-@xmath0 are affected by such fluctuations .",
    "the fluctuations that are likely to have the most impact are the gapless goldstone modes of @xmath1he-@xmath0 , while fluctuations in the amplitude of the order parameter have a gap on the order of the bulk energy gap and can be neglected at the energy scale of the surface states .",
    "related work by grover and vishwanath@xcite studied the coupling between majorana surface states and bulk fluctuations in topological superconductors .",
    "however , the bulk fluctuations they consider are fluctuations of a magnetic order parameter that is assumed to exist in addition to the physics of superfluidity , while we are considering fluctuations of the superfluid order parameter itself ( which gives rise to majorana surface states in the first place ) . in other words ,",
    "the physics we focus on is intrinsic to superfluidity in @xmath1he-@xmath0 and does not require the proximity to a novel quantum critical point .",
    "other conceptually related work includes the study of thermal fluctuations of the order parameter in 3d @xmath2-wave superconductors@xcite and 2d chiral topological superconductors,@xcite as well as the study of proximity - induced topological superconductivity by a 1d superconductor where quantum fluctuations imply algebraically decaying superconducting correlations but no true long - range order.@xcite    our main results may be summarized as follows . out of the four goldstone modes in @xmath1he-@xmath0the phase mode and the three spin - orbit modes ",
    "we find that only one spin - orbit mode couples to the surface majorana fermions . unlike the phase mode ,",
    "the spin - orbit modes are in fact not truly gapless : they acquire a small gap due to the dipole - dipole interaction between nuclei of the @xmath1he atoms . nevertheless , the surface majorana fermions can exchange quanta of this bulk mode , leading to an effective short - range four - fermion interaction between them ( fig .",
    "[ fig : surfbulk ] ) with a coupling constant that is inversely proportional to the strength of the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "this interaction is perturbatively irrelevant in the renormalization group sense , but can lead to a quantum phase transition towards a gapped surface phase with spontaneously broken time - reversal symmetry if the coupling constant exceeds a certain critical value .",
    "we estimate this critical value in mean - field theory , and find that the effective surface coupling constant in @xmath1he-@xmath0 is of the same order of magnitude as the critical one .",
    "this suggests that the majorana surface states in @xmath1he-@xmath0 are in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition to a time - reversal symmetry breaking phase , if not already in that phase .",
    "this latter possibility is not necessarily excluded by recent experimental work consistent with the presence of gapless surface states in @xmath1he-@xmath0 , because a small but nonzero gap would be hard to detect .",
    "although our mean - field theory predicts that the transition is first order , it could ultimately become continuous if fluctuation effects are considered , in which case the corresponding quantum critical point should exhibit an emergent @xmath3 supersymmetry.@xcite    the strategy we adopt in this paper is as follows .",

    "<S> band insulators and superfluids are , however , fundamentally different : while the former exist in the absence of inter - particle interactions , the latter are broken symmetry states that owe their very existence to such interactions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , unlike the static energy gap of a band insulator , the gap in a superfluid is due to a dynamical order parameter that is subject to both thermal and quantum fluctuations . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we explore the consequences of bulk quantum fluctuations of the order parameter in the @xmath0 phase of superfluid @xmath1he on the topologically protected majorana surface states . neglecting the high - energy amplitude modes </S>",
    "<S> , we find that one of the three spin - orbit goldstone modes in @xmath1he-@xmath0 couples to the surface majorana fermions . </S>",
    "<S> this coupling in turn induces an effective short - range two - body interaction between the majorana fermions , with coupling constant inversely proportional to the strength of the nuclear dipole - dipole interaction in bulk @xmath1he . </S>",
    "<S> a mean - field theory estimate of the value of this coupling suggests that the surface majorana fermions in @xmath1he-@xmath0 are in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition to a gapped time - reversal symmetry breaking phase . </S>"
