    "at the present time , the only way@xcite to go through the `` @xmath4 barrier '' is to use the operator approach to 2d gravity .",
    "the basic reason seems to be that one should treat the two screening charges symmetrically in the strong coupling regime , since they are complex conjugate .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with what is currently done in the weak coupling regime , say using matrix models . in the operator approach ,",
    "the quantum group structure was shown@xcite to be of the type @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 = 12(c-13 + ) , [ 1.1 ] where @xmath9 is the central charge of liouville theory .",
    "each quantum group parameter is associated with a screening charge by the relations @xmath10 , @xmath11 . in the strong coupling regime @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "are complex conjugate .",
    "thus , treating them symmetrically , as was done in refs.@xcite , is the key .",
    "a major progress was made in ref.@xcite by proving a unitary truncation theorem , that holds for special values of @xmath9 .",
    "the point of this theorem is as follows .",
    "the basic family of @xmath15 chiral operators in 2d gravity may be labelled by two quantum group spins @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , with @xmath18 , @xmath19 , so that the spectrum of virasoro weights is given by _ j = c-124- 1 24 ( ( j++1 )",
    "-(j- ) ) ^2 , [ 1.2 ] in agreement with kac s formula .",
    "the weak coupling regime corresponds to @xmath20 where this formula is automatically real , for real @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . in this paper",
    ", we deal with the strong coupling regime @xmath21 .",
    "then , since @xmath22 is real , and @xmath23 pure imaginary , the formula just written gives complex results in general .",
    "however  in a way that is reminiscent of the truncations that give the minimal unitary models for @xmath24 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , there is a consistent truncation of the above general family down to an operator algebra involving operators with real virasoro conformal weights only .",
    "these are of two types .",
    "the first has spins @xmath25 , and virasoro weights that are negative ; the second has @xmath26 , and virasoro weights that are positive .    in this article , we improve with respect to the previous situation of ref.@xcite in several respects .",
    "first , ref.@xcite only dealt with the fusion algebra at the level of primaries , making use of the quantum group structure unravelled in refs.@xcite .",
    "the recent articles @xcite which combine the operator approach with the moore and seiberg scheme@xcite , will allow us to deal with arbitrary descendants .",
    "second , ref.@xcite did not fully clarify the role of the coupling constants  that are not governed solely by the quantum group symmetry .",
    "this may now be done using the general formulae of refs.@xcite .",
    "third , the spectrum of zero - modes of the physical hilbert space of the strongly coupled theories is such that the corresponding set of operators should involve in some cases chiral primary fields with quantum group spins that are rational numbers instead of halves of integers .",
    "these operators were not considered in ref.@xcite , since the stucture of the chiral operator algebra was not yet known well enough to generalize to non - half - integer spins .",
    "this is now possible thanks to ref.@xcite .",
    "moreover , a recent study@xcite@xcite based on an operator coulomb - gas realization makes it possible to derive the braiding of chiral vertex operators with arbitrary spins provided the screening numbers remain integer .",
    "finally , the liouville string associated with the strongly coupled theories under consideration , remarkable as they may be@xcite , remain complicated .",
    "it was proposed earlier@xcite to consider strongly coupled topological models , obtained by considering together two copies of liouville , so that the total central charge is @xmath27 .",
    "our study confirms the consistency of these models . using our determination of the coupling constants",
    ", we may calculate their three - point functions , it is found to be a product of leg factors much like the result of matrix models for @xmath28 as recovered from the continuous liouville theory in the present framework@xcite",
    ". however , a strikingly novel feature appears . in the strong coupling regime , the liouville exponentials can not be used , since they do not preserve the physical hilbert space .",
    "they are replaced@xcite by other local vertex operators which shift the zero modes of the left- and right - movers in uncorrelated ways , so that it is not consistent to assume that their quantum group spins @xmath16 and @xmath29 are equal .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the liouville field .",
    "it shows that the strong coupling regime may be characterized by a deconfinement of chirality .",
    "in this section we go through some background material as a preparation for the main body of the paper .",
    "all notations are the same as in the previous articles using the operator method .",
    "we shall not fully re - explain the conventions .",

    "@xmath77 ) is closed by fusion and braiding , and only gives states that belong to @xmath78 .    with the formulae",
    "just recalled we may explain the main point of our paper .",
    "the fusion and braiding relations eqs.[2.1 ] and [ 2.2 ] are operator relations computed between states @xmath45 on the left and @xmath79 on the right . yet",
    "all spins are treated on the same footing , following the basic scheme of moore and seiberg , where there is a one - to - one correspondence between the spectra of highest weights and conformal weights of primary fields .",
    "this will force us to an extensive generalization of the work of ref.@xcite .",
    "first , in eqs.[2.1 ] , [ 2.2 ] , the spins @xmath68 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 were assumed to be integers . on the other hand",
    ", we may write eq.[2.6 ] as _ r , n=__r , n , j_r , n = r2(2-s)+n-12 , _ r , n = -r2(2-s)-n+12 [ 2.15 ] .",
    "one sees that , for @xmath83 , and @xmath72 , this introduces spins that are rational numbers , but not halves of integers .",
    "once we go away from half - integer spins , we may as well consider continuous spins as is done in refs.@xcite .",
    "second , the treatment of ref.@xcite had another basic difference between the spectrum of highest - weight states and of conformal weights of primary operators : the physical spectrum of the latter involves two types of fields ( @xmath66 ) , with @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , respectively , while the physical hilbert space only involved spins satisfying the latter type condition , as is clear from eq.[2.15 ] .",
    "the reason is that the physical hilbert space was taken to have positive highest - weights so that the virasoro representation be unitary . from the viewpoint of the operator algebra we are led to enlarge the hilbert space and consider ^_s _",
    "r=0 ^ 1s_n=-^__s(^_r ,",
    "n ) , [ 2.16 ] ^_r , n ( r2s+n ) ( 1 ) . [ 2.17 ] now eq.[2.9 ] is generalized to ^_r , n=_^_r , n , j^_r , n = r2(2s)+n-12 , ^_r , n = + n-12 [ 2.18 ] .",
    "one sees that for @xmath72 , the @xmath16 s may be fourths of integers , while , for @xmath84 ( resp .",
    "@xmath83 ) the @xmath85 s ( resp . the @xmath86 s )",
    "may be sixths of integers .",
    "a parenthetical remark is in order at this point . in general , a highest - weight state @xmath87 is eigenstate of @xmath88 with an eigenvalue @xmath89 that is invariant under @xmath90 . since the corresponding verma module @xmath37 may be deduced group theoretically once this eigenvalue is fixed , it follows that @xmath37 and @xmath91 are the same hilbert space .",
    "changing @xmath92 in eq.[2.17 ] is equivalent to changing @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "it is thus related to the symmetry put forward in ref.@xcite .",
    "we shall make use of this freedom below .",
    "returning to our main line , let us note that , in @xmath95 , the highest weights are real but negative .",
    "what is its physical meaning ?",
    "this brings in the proposal of ref.@xcite .",
    "there it was remarked that the spectrum of physical conformal weights eq.[2.8 ] is such that ^(j , c)+^(j , 26-c)=1 [ 2.19 ] . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath9 takes the special values eq.[2.7 ] one has 26-c = 1 + 6(s+2),s=-s [ 2.20 ] . thus we may construct a consistent string model with two copies of strongly coupled liouville theories , one with @xmath53 playing the role of gravity , and the other with @xmath96 being considered as the matter . following the usual counting where the brst cohomology removes two degrees of freedom",
    ", this theory has essentially no degree of freedom , meaning that it is topological .",
    "this is why the hilbert space @xmath97 may be used : the excitations that would be negative - normed states decouple .",
    "this situation is of course similar to the one of the @xmath28 topological models . ] .",
    "thus we shall follow closely the liouville derivation@xcite of the three - point function for the @xmath28 models .",
    "the plan of the article is as follows . in section 3",
    "we first prove some mathematical properties concerning the extension of the 6-j symbols to non - integer spins .",
    "these are necessary to generalize the operator algebra to non - integer spins , as done in section 4 .",
    "this extension to non - integer spins will be shown to consistently include representations in a generalized sense that are semi - infinite . in the language of the coulomb - gas approach to conformal theories , they correspond to chiral fields with numbers of screening operators that are positive integers .",
    "this is actually how they are explicitly constructed in refs.@xcite . as such , they are not what is needed to define the operators of the family @xmath74 , since these involve negative spins and negative screening numbers . in section 5",
    "we thus continue our results to negative `` screening numbers '' thanks to the continuation @xmath98 , put forward in ref.@xcite , which we apply to the generalized 6-j symbols .",
    "this involves a non trivial identity on q - deformed hypergeometric functions @xmath99 .",
    "we are then ready to build the physical consistent algebra ( in section 6 ) , and show that it is fully closed by fusion and braiding to all order in the secondaries . in other words , at the special values we have a complete truncation of the chiral bootstrap equations down to the one describing the opa of a set of chiral fields with real conformal weights . finally ,",
    "in section 7 , we apply the formulae just derived to compute the three - point function of the topological models mentioned above .",
    "our discussion will follow the line of ref.@xcite , by establishing relations between the quantum group symbols of @xmath49 , and @xmath51 , that hold at the special values , and ensure that the truncation theorem holds .",
    "however , we will be led to change the definition of the @xmath100 fields .",
    "let us comment about this now . in ref.@xcite , the following expression for the @xmath58 fields was used _ - ^(j ) = _ m =- j^j c_m^(j ) ( ) e^im [ -h + ( h-)/2 ] _ m , -m^(j , j ) [ 2.9 ] c_m^(j ) ( ) ( -1)^j - m 2j j - m _",
    "t=0 ^2j -j+m - t+2 m , [ 2.10 ] where @xmath101 means that we work up to factors that only depend upon @xmath16 .",
    "the chiral fields @xmath102 differ from @xmath103 by normalization factors , noted @xmath104 in the recent papers . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the method used was as follows .",
    "one starts from the ansatz for the simplest case @xmath105 closure by braiding requires a(_rn)b(_r n+1 ) = ( h_rn ) ( h_r n+1 ) [ 2.14 ] where @xmath106 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "the following solution of these equations was used in refs.@xcite : @xmath107 which , using leading - order fusion , leads to eq.[2.9 ] .",
    "this particular choice was made in order to arrive at simple expressions in terms of the quantum - group covariant chiral fields @xmath108 .",
    "at that time , the complete braiding matrix was only known for the @xmath109 fields , so that the discussion made an extensive use of them .",
    "the present viewpoint is somewhat different .",
    "we shall use the @xmath110 fields instead of the @xmath111 s , or the @xmath109 s .",
    "moreover , we consider fusion to all orders in the descendants .",
    "the definitions which appear natural from the present standpoint look rather different from the ones of ref.@xcite .",
    "it is thus useful to sketch how eq.[2.9 ] is related with the general expression we will derive in section 6 .",
    "this is done in an appendix .",
    "[ s2 ]    in this section we propose a generalization of the 6-j symbols to non - half - integer spins , and prove the corresponding generalized polynomial equations in particular the pentagonal relation .",
    "although purely mathematical , this generalization stems from the needs of physics , and we shall therefore follow this guide , in two steps .",
    "the standard three - leg vertex operators intertwine three standard representations of @xmath49 labelled by positive half - integers .",
    "their algebra was completely elucidated in ref.@xcite , using moore and seiberg formalism . however , since the early eighties gervais and neveu have introduced operators of positive half - integer spins , but acting on a hilbert space described by a continuous zero - mode @xmath36 or equivalently , by a continuous spin .",
    "this will lead to the first step of generalization .",
    "the discrete values @xmath112 , with @xmath113 , give back the standard case .",
    "the second step will come from operators with three continuous spins .",
    "their braiding has already been elucidated in refs.@xcite using a coulomb - gas approach .",
    "it is essentially given by the generalized 6-j introduced by askey and wilson@xcite who proved the orthogonality relation .",
    "our more generalized 6-j coincide with theirs , and moreover we prove the other polynomial equations .",
    "these two generalizations could seem to be of a very different kind , but they actually follow one another very naturally . the right language is not the one of half - integer positive or continuous spins but a question of number of restrictions on the spins , the former being only a consequence of the latter .",
    "let us be more explicit .",
    "we use dotted vertices , a dot on one leg meaning that the sum of the spins of the two other legs minus the spin of this leg is constrained to be a positive integer . since there are three legs at a vertex we may have one , two or three dots .",
    "we call them type ti1 , ti2 , ti3 , where the letters t and i stand for triangular inequalities .",
    "we illustrate the meaning of the dots : @xmath114 @xmath115 adding dots to a vertex adds other restrictions . for the type ti3 , we have \\ {    ccc j_1+j_2-j_12 & & + j_12+j_2-j_1 & & + j_1+j_12-j_2 & & +    }    c 2j_1,2j_2,2j_12 .",
    "[ threecond ] these are but the usual ( full ) triangular inequalities , or the branching rules for @xmath43 , with half - integer spins .",
    "so , the standard operators are of the ti3 type .",
    "the first step of generalization is to relax one restriction , which gives the ti2 type :  \\ {    ccc j_1+j_2-j_12 + j_1+j_12-j_2 +    }  2j_1 [ twocond ] @xmath116 and @xmath117 being arbitrary . in this ti2 case",
    ", @xmath118 is a positive half - integer , and @xmath119 is a half - integer ( positive or negative ) .",
    "this is fixed by the number of restrictions .",
    "the second step is of course to keep only one restriction ( type ti1 ) :  j_1+j_2-j_12 [ onecond ] and none of the spins are half - integers",
    ". then the fusion or braiding of such generalized vertices lead to 6-j symbols generalized in a very specific way , and the `` miracle '' is that it is mathematically consistent . in the first step of generalization , fusion and braiding lead to two different generalized 6-j , whereas they lead to only one kind of 6-j in the second step .",
    "first , we try to define a 6-j coefficient for the following fusion operation : .",
    "[ fustwocond ] it follows from the general rules for these three ti2 and one ti3 vertices that @xmath118 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 are positive half - integers , that @xmath122 , for @xmath123 are positive integers ( @xmath124 ) , and that @xmath118 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 satisfy the full triangular inequality .",
    "the standard@xcite ( i.e. four ti3 ) definition of the q - deformed 6-j symbols that is to be generalized , is : @xmath125 @xmath126 @xmath127 [ sixj1 ] with ( l , j , k)= [ delta ] and n ! _ r=1^n r , x .",
    "these 6-j coefficients involve square roots with sign ambiguities . in the building of strong coupling regime operators ,",
    "the cancellation of signs is of a great importance ( see section [ s5 ] ) , and we must therefore treat them consistently . following ref.@xcite , and since the basic mathematical tool is the relationship between sine and gamma functions , we define square roots of sine functions for non - integer argument from the relation @xmath128 .",
    "the choice of the sheet for @xmath129 is determined so that the relation @xmath130 holds , where @xmath131 is defined as usual with a cut on the negative real axis .",
    "this specifies the relation between @xmath132 and @xmath133 . in the present case",

    "if h is complex , as it is the case in the strong coupling regime , @xmath135 is far from the cut . for the weak coupling regime , on the contrary , @xmath13 is real , and one should temporarily give a small imaginary part to @xmath16 or to @xmath13 to specify the sheet .    for simplicity",

    "these ti1 s are the `` selection rules '' we used for our vertex operators to build the physical @xmath100 operators .",

    "there are three different algebras with ti3 , ti2 or ti1 .",
    "once one of these three possibilities is chosen the algebra is consistent , but , if one of the spins that was not forseen to be half - integer when making this choice happens `` accidentally '' to be half - integer , there are zeros and singularities arising .",
    "they cancel however in the polynomial equations due to their rational character . in particular , this is the case in the traditional construction of gervais et al where the zero - mode of the incoming and outgoing states is continuous , so that one is in the case ti2 .",
    "it can easily be checked ,  even for basic @xmath422 operators , the braiding and fusion of which are directly deduced from the differential equation  that there are zeros and singularities arising if the zero - mode @xmath36 ever happens to be equal to @xmath423 , with @xmath68 integer . at the level of 6-j s ,",
    "one can either keep ti2 and have singularities for some discrete values of the zero - mode , or use ti3 and have perfectly finite results , as was done in ref.@xcite .    in the strong coupling case , however , we must consider spins of the form @xmath418 in order to complete modular invariance@xcite .",
    "so we have to use ti1 . and",
    "half - integer spins arise naturally from non - half - integer ones .",
    "hence , we need such vertex operators like [ sing ] .",
    "although surprising when one is familiar with ti3 , they can indeed be constructed .",
    "the first one is simply a screening operator and the second one has got many extra screening operators .",
    "they are not considered usually as they are singular .",
    "what saves us in this case of strong coupling regime is that the singularities of the operators that we must consider cancel each other thanks to the particular choice of @xmath154 and @xmath308 .",
    "more precisely , it means that although the 6-j coefficients considered all along this section , and in particular in eq.[fus2 ] , may be singular or zero , nevertheless , the orthogonality relation eq.[orthog ] holds , as it is an equation between rational functions , and it allows to go from eq.[fus2 ] to eq.[fuschi- ] , cancelling the singularities , [ sixjeh+ ] relating hatted and unhatted 6-j coefficients are not identities at the level of rational fractions but for the particular values [ h- ] and [ h+ ] of the spins . ] .",
    "this is one more miracle of this construction for the strong coupling regime : although for the basic @xmath110 operators the choice of spins [ h- ] or [ h+ ] leads to singularities coming from the 6-j coefficients ( until eq.[fus2 ] ) , these singularities disappear for the physical @xmath100 operators in eqs.[fuschi- ] , [ brdchi- ] , [ fuschi+ ] , [ brdchi+ ] .",
    "we want to point out that it has some astonishing implications , like the following : the orthogonality eq.[orthog ] can be used with spins @xmath179 , @xmath117 , @xmath188 , @xmath191 half - integers such that it is possible to find spins @xmath116 and @xmath183 such that 4 ti3 s are satisfied . however , we sum over @xmath183 verifying ti1 and thanks to the cancellation of zeros and singularities the result is still the identity matrix for a range of @xmath116 and @xmath424 determined by ti1 : @xmath425 $ ] .",
    "it seems curious as for the same spins there is as well a standard orthogonality relation with 4 ti3 s .",
    "there is no incompatibility between both of them : if instead , we chose to sum over @xmath183 with ti3 i.e. @xmath426 , the result is now ( even for @xmath116 and @xmath424 verifying ti1 , hence in @xmath427 $ ] ) the projector on the space of spins @xmath116 and @xmath424 verifying ti3 : @xmath428 [ max(@xmath429),min(@xmath430 ) ] .",
    "this is the standard orthogonality relation .",
    "so , if the spins are half - integers , we can consistently choose either to stay in the subspace of vertices verifying ti3 , or to go to the larger space of vertices verifying ti1 ( and have singularities in the case of @xmath110 operators ) .",
    "once this choice is made on the initial vertex operators , the vertex operators obtained by braidings and fusions remain of the same kind .",
    "the same is true with the intermediate case of ti2 .",
    "all this was checked numerically on many exemples .",
    "since ti1 must be the selection rules in every case here , the fusion eqs.[fuschi- ] , [ fuschi2- ] , [ fuschi+ ] involve an infinite sum as @xmath121 is not bounded from below .",
    "this is not different from the braiding eqs.[brdchi- ] , [ brdchi+ ] , where the intermediate states between @xmath431 and @xmath432 are in infinite number .",
    "however , if all the four external spins are specified ( i.e. if the left and right states are specified as well ) , these infinite sums disappear .",
    "the same question must be asked concerning the @xmath280 coefficients .",
    "the answer is the same : they are finite in our case in contrast with the general case .",
    "more precisely , one can see that in the general case , if some spins ever turn out to be half - integer whereas the full triangular inequalities are not fulfilled , there are zeros and poles arising .",
    "they do not cancel with the ones of the 6-j coefficients in general ( see e.g. the fusion coefficient for spin 1/2 eq.[fus1/2 ] ) .",
    "however , a careful analysis , that we do not detail here for brevity sake , shows that the @xmath280 s of interest here , i.e. with all spins such that @xmath25 or @xmath26 , never bring poles ( to see this , use the expression of @xmath280 in terms of arbitrary path eq.[h2 ] , note that there are only zeros or poles when changing of quarter of plane , and that in both of our cases , the beginning and ending points of the paths are on the same diagonal , which involves two changes of quarter plane that cancel one an other ) .",
    "they are never zero except when one of the three spins involved in a @xmath280 coefficient is @xmath433 .",
    "this agrees with the leg - factors of the final result eq.[7.26 ] which are zero in such a case only .",
    "this is not really surprising as the representation of spin -1/2 is very peculiar .",
    "as already indicated , we may consider two copies of the strongly coupled models under consideration with central charges c=1 + 6(s+2 ) , c=1 + 6(-s+2 ) . [",
    "7.1 ] the second plays the role of matter , while the first may be considered as gravity .",
    "the latter gives a proper dressing , since obviously , c+c=26 [ 7.2 ] . in this section , we determine the corresponding three - point functions .",

    "there are several interesting physical points to make about our results . in particular",

    "the result is real , while the weak - coupling formula is complex in the strong coupling case . from the viewpoint of conformal theories ,",
    "the cosmological term is the marginal operator that takes us away from free - field theory .",
    "thus at @xmath4 a new marginal operator replaces the standard one , and this is why the theory for @xmath522 looks so different .",
    "we have seen that the barrier seems to be related to a deconfinement of chirality .",
    "this is also clear on the expression of @xmath521 : it corresponds to a metric tensor which is a simple product of one analytic function by its anti - analytic counterpart . in a way",

    "we shall return to these points in a separate article .",
    "another remark is that the present new topological models may be simple enough so that their n - point functions are derivable in closed form .",

    "it should be helpful , to make progress for the liouville string theories in full - fledged space - times . in the weak coupling regime , going to continuous @xmath16 also seems a key step .",

    "the present method should be extendable to the @xmath523 super - liouville theory , making use of the quantum group structure exhibited in ref.@xcite . this will be useful to study the liouville superstrings@xcite , which are very interesting physically .",
