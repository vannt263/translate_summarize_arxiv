    "the spectral properties of random markov matrices have received increasing attention over the years @xcite . in applications , it is useful to randomly sample a large markov matrix , such that the mixing rate of the associated markov chain is controllable .",

    "in either case , the spectral gap of @xmath40 can not be tuned .",
    "the results suggest that , in order for the spectral gap or , equivalently , @xmath50 to be tunable , the ( marginal ) distribution of the entries of @xmath41 needs to change according to @xmath23 .",

    "the main problem with the example is that @xmath40 has few features .",
    "it is nearly the transition matrix of a chain of random variables uniformly taking @xmath23 values .",
    "the lack of features is also reflected in the esd of @xmath40 , which converges to @xmath63 as @xmath47 . despite this , the example shows that it is possible to tune the spectral gap by using sparse random graphs . in general ,",

    "the effects of @xmath70 on spectral clustering and concentration of the esd have been studied in statistical machine learning @xcite .    the close relation between random matrices and random graphs is well known ; see @xcite and references therein . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that if @xmath2 is the adjacency matrix of a random graph following the uniform distribution @xmath71 on the set of regular graphs on @xmath23 vertices with fixed degree @xmath72 , then as @xmath47 , @xmath73 weakly converges with limiting density @xmath74 $ ] , where @xmath75 . by weyl",

    "we also mention that for a uniformly sampled doubly markov matrix , which is irreversible , its limiting esd is degenerate @xcite .",
