    ". then , the system is well described by the bose - hubbard model  @xcite , @xmath4 where @xmath5 , reflecting the periodic nature of the ring lattice . the field operator @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) creates ( annihilates ) a boson on the @xmath8-th site , and @xmath9 is the number operator .",
    "@xmath10 is the hopping energy and @xmath11 the onsite interaction .",
    "the phase twist @xmath12 can be controlled by rotating the lattice  @xcite ( or equivalently by writing the hamiltonian in the rotating frame ) . in the case of commensurate fillings ,",
    "where the filling factor @xmath13 is integer , the bose - hubbard model exhibits a quantum phase transition from a superfluid to a mott insulator as @xmath14 is increased . since our interest is in the dynamics of supercurrents ,",
    "we focus only on the superfluid regime throughout this paper .",
    "for pursuing our main goal of examining the validity of the instanton method , it is imperative to reveal basic properties of the quantum dynamics associated with eq .",
    "( [ eq : bhh ] ) . in this section",
    ", we confirm that a supercurrent flowing through the ring lattice actually exhibits mqt during the real - time evolution . in the next section",
    ", we will compare the period of oscillations extracted from the mqt dynamics with that obtained by the instanton method .    to treat the quantum dynamics",
    ", we use the quasi - exact numerical method , tebd  @xcite , which is conceptually equivalent to the well - known time - dependent density matrix renormalization group  @xcite .",
    "this method allows us to compute accurately the evolution of many - body wave functions of 1d quantum lattice systems .",
    "recently , tebd has been successfully adopted by one of us to a system with periodic boundary conditions  @xcite . in order to study how a supercurrent behaves as a function of time ,",
    "one needs to prepare a current - carrying state as an initial state of the real time evolution . for this purpose ,",
    "setting @xmath15 , we first perform the imaginary time propagation for eq .",
    "( [ eq : bhh ] ) , which provides a current - carrying state with the winding number @xmath16 . at @xmath17",
    "the phase twist is suddenly shifted to @xmath18 , @xmath19 , so that another state with the winding number @xmath20 is exactly degenerate with the initial state .",
    "we then simulate the dynamics in this system propagating the initial state in real time .",
    "first we analyze the situation where the filling factor and the initial winding number are equal to unity : @xmath21 and investigate how the time evolution of supercurrents depends on the parameters of the model @xmath14 and @xmath22 .",

    "note that the plot represents a sketch of an actual process occurring in the multi - dimensional phase space . ]",
    "let us start with the simplest case , @xmath26 , where two macroscopically distinct states with winding numbers 1 and 0 are the degenerate lowest energy states .",
    "this situation is analogous to a superconducting flux qubit realized in a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) , where two flux states with different winding numbers are degenerate producing coherent rabi oscillations  @xcite . likewise in our case",
    "we expect coherent oscillations between the two degenerate states via mqt as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : mqt](a ) .    to demonstrate this ,",
    "we first calculate the time evolution of the current velocity @xmath25 given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the lattice spacing . when @xmath29 , the velocity is almost constant , i.e. , the supercurrent is persistent .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath14 is sufficiently large , e.g. @xmath30 , quantum fluctuations are strong enough to kick the state out from the one of the minima , and the superfluid coherently oscillates between the states with velocities @xmath31 and @xmath32 as shown in fig .

    "hence , the wave function is approximated by a macroscopic superposition of the states with @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( schrdinger cat state ) as @xmath54 in fig .",
    "[ fig : con](b ) , we show the momentum occupations for @xmath55 , which behave almost identically to the overlaps , again justifying validity of the cat state description .",
    "we note that the similar cat state dynamics has been found also for quantum vortices in anisotropic traps  @xcite and supercurrents in two - color optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "we next consider the case of @xmath24 , where @xmath44 and @xmath46 are degenerate . in this case , there are two possible scenarios of the fate of the supercurrent : ( i ) the supercurrent decays towards the zero momentum state creating excitations .",

    "it is very likely that this scenario is indeed realized when the differences in winding numbers of @xmath22 and @xmath56 is large .",
    "in contrast , it is found in our numerical simulations that the second scenario mainly dictates the supercurrent dynamics as seen in figs .  [",

    "the supercurrent exhibits a coherent oscillation between states with velocities @xmath31 and @xmath57 with rapid wiggles .",

    "the zero momentum occupancy @xmath58 ( blue dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : con ] ) oscillates in time with the same frequency as the wiggles in the @xmath59 while the overlap of @xmath60 with @xmath45 always remains zero .",
    "this means that the wiggles come from the coupling with the excited states with winding number 0 and that such states contribute to the wave function in addition to @xmath44 and @xmath46 .",

    "we note that there is no direct connection between the phase slip in real time and that in imaginary time  @xcite ( see also supplementary information , section iii ) .",
    "the dynamics in real time reflects the behavior of the average phase difference @xmath61 , which comprises phase slips occurring at different times in different sites .",
    "this phase slip can be extracted from the superposition of two macroscopically distinct states with different winding numbers . at the same time the phase slip in imaginary time",

    "[ fig : taul ] , we show the period @xmath51 of the coherent oscillations as a function of @xmath3 on a log - log scale .",
    "there we clearly see that the period monotonically increases with @xmath3 following a power law , @xmath85 .",
    "since the current @xmath86 at a fixed winding number is inversely proportional to @xmath3 this implies that the frequency of oscillations scales as a power of the current .",
    "this effect is similar to the situation happening in 2d superconductors at finite temperatures  @xcite , where the supercurrent dissipation rate coming from vortex unbinding also scales as a power of the current .",
    "we also note that the commensurability of the filling factor is crucial for the coherent supercurrent dynamics . only in case of commensurate fillings ,",

    "having established that the supercurrent dynamics exhibits coherent oscillations caused by mqt , we now compare the frequency of oscillations calculated by the instanton method with the tebd results . for this purpose",
    ", we choose the situation of @xmath23 , characterized by a single phase slip dynamics .",
    "to seek a simple analytical expression of the energy splitting between the two current states @xmath96 , which is the same as the oscillation frequency , we assume @xmath97 and @xmath98 . in this case the bose - hubbard model can be mapped onto the @xmath99 quantum rotor model  @xcite .",
    "this limit also describes a regular array of coupled josephson junctions .",
    "we have confirmed that the quantum rotor model indeed gives a very accurate value of @xmath96 when the filling is large : @xmath100 ( see supplementary information , section ii ) . in the quantum rotor model",
    "the phase space variables are the superfluid phases on each site and the conjugate momenta , corresponding to the fluctuations of the number of particles .",
    "so overall the phase space consists of @xmath101 variables .",
    "applying the instanton method to the quantum rotor model , we obtain the energy splitting expressed as @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the josephson plasma energy and @xmath88 is the effective planck s constant .",
    "note that @xmath104 deep in the superfluid regime where number and phase can be approximately treated as classical variables . at @xmath105",
    "the quantum fluctuations become important and can even drive the system to a different insulating phase  @xcite . since the instanton method is a generalization of the wkb semiclassical approximation  @xcite , the expression for the energy splitting ( [ eq : espins1 ] ) is supposed to be accurate when @xmath106 is sufficiently small .",
    "we note that the quantum rotor model has a clear advantage over original bose - hubbard model that the instanton action @xmath107 and the coefficient @xmath108 do not depend on @xmath14 and @xmath109 ( see methods and supplementary information for specific expressions of @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) . in other words ,",

    ", as @xmath95 decreases , the error also decreases such that it is within @xmath115 when @xmath116 .",
    "it is hard to push the calculation to even smaller values of @xmath95 because of exponential sensitivity of the period of oscillations to the effective planck s constant .",

    ", the error for @xmath114 is significantly larger than that for @xmath92 .",
    "moreover the error does not even monotonically depend on @xmath95 .",
    "this clearly means that at this filling the quantum rotor model gives only qualitative description of the tunneling process .",
    "we analyzed quantum dynamics of supercurrents of one - dimensional lattice bosons in a ring .",
    "in particular , our focus was on the coherent oscillations between the two degenerate current states via macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) .",
    "the period of these oscillations @xmath51 is related to the energy splitting @xmath96 induced by the tunneling as @xmath118 .",
    "we calculated @xmath96 both simulating real - time dynamics using the time - evolving block decimation ( tebd ) method and within the imaginary time instanton method .",
    "we showed that the result of instanton calculation is in very good quantitative agreement with the tebd result when the effective planck s constant @xmath95 is sufficiently small .",
    "this agreement verifies the instanton method applied to coherent mqt involving many collective variables .",
    "we also want to emphasize that the success in applying tebd ( or equivalently the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ) to mqt problems opens up new possibilities to analyzing macroscopic tunneling phenomena .",
    "in particular , ( i ) tebd allows us to precisely calculate the energy splitting even for large @xmath95 , where the instanton method fails .",
    "( ii ) tebd provides time evolution of the many - body wave function , from which one can calculate various quantities , for example different correlation functions .",
    "the first advantage ( i ) is crucial for quantitative simulation of experiments ( e.g. in cold gases ) , where it is easier to work in the regime of larger @xmath95 and shorter periods to avoid various effects of decoherence like particle losses .",
    "moreover , the second advantage allows one to reveal detailed processes of mqt in real time . as an example , we have analyzed the time evolution of the phase - phase correlation functions and revealed the existence of the phase slips associated with the coherent oscillations , which can be detected in experiments .",
    "one can extend this analysis to study higher order correlation functions to e.g. detect shot noise of phase slips or even their full counting statistics  @xcite .",

    "<S> the list of such phenomena includes the @xmath1-decay of nuclei  @xcite , tunneling between vacuum states in quantum cosmology  @xcite and chromodynamics  @xcite , macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) in quantum gases  @xcite and condensed matter  @xcite , and also includes potential applications in quantum information  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> instanton methods are general schemes describing quantum tunneling within a semiclassical approximation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they are applicable to the broad range of problems listed above . </S>",
    "<S> these methods are based on the solution of the classical equations of motion in imaginary - time coordinate allowing one to obtain an analytical expression for the tunneling rate . </S>",
    "<S> the instanton methods are closely related to the langer s formalism of decay of metastable states due to thermal fluctuations  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . given the versatility and utility of the instanton methods , it is important to examine how accurately they predict the actual tunneling rate . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this question is not entirely trivial . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for applicability of the langer s formalism it is important that the thermal bath ( which can be a part of the macroscopic system ) is big enough to provide sufficient energy necessary to overcome the barrier separating metastable and stable phases .    for single particle problems , especially in one - dimension , </S>",
    "<S> the instanton methods can be easily verified because the corresponding schrdinger equation can be solved numerically with arbitrary precision . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> such numerical verification of the instanton methods is usually very difficult for complex systems consisting of many degrees of freedom , such as mqt and tunneling decay of the false vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , in the context of the current - biased josephson junction , where the phase difference between the two superconductors is regarded as a macroscopic quantum variable , experiments have been extensively compared with the theory of mqt  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that the experiments and the theory are in agreement to the extent that the instanton method provides an estimate of the order of the magnitude of the tunneling rate . however , this comparison is inevitably limited by the experimental uncertainty , which arises from the fact that the theory uses phenomenological parameters extracted from separate experiments . for rigorous verification of the instanton methods , </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to make direct comparison of their predictions with the first principles many - body simulations in a complex system .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we study mqt of supercurrents of bosons in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) ring lattice to examine the validity of the instanton method applied to mqt . using the time - evolving block decimation ( tebd ) method  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> we perform first principles simulations of the real - time dynamics of the corresponding bose - hubbard model . in the regime where the energies of two macroscopic states with different winding numbers are degenerate , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the supercurrent exhibits coherent oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> these oscillations are accompanied by phase slips which result in sudden change of the winding number characterizing the supercurrent . </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling rate is accurately extracted from the period of oscillations , while it is also calculated by the instanton method in the quantum rotor limit corresponding to large filling factors  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we are thus able to compare the numerical tebd results with the prediction of the instanton method with no ambiguity . </S>",
    "<S> our main finding is that the error of the instanton method is within 10% when the effective planck s constant is sufficiently small . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the coherent oscillations of current persist even between the degenerate states with winding numbers different by two . </S>",
    "<S> such process corresponds to the dynamics associated with coherent oscillations of double phase - slips . </S>"
