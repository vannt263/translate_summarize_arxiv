    "<S> we can think of five reasons for this underestimation . </S>",
    "<S> first , a larger dielectric constant ( @xmath163 ) could produce better agreement between dft and ndd since the spin - driven polarizations are proportional to the dielectric constant that enters eq .  </S>",

    "<S> second , consideration of an electrically - induced polarization ( @xmath164 , @xmath165 ) not parallel to electric field ( @xmath49 ) could improve the results quantitatively . </S>",
    "<S> third , higher - frequency polar modes which were not considered here also can affect ndd . </S>",
    "<S> fourth , a smaller hubbard @xmath34 will increase the spin - driven polarizations and improve the agreement with the experimental fits . </S>",
    "<S> fifth , magnon modes were observed between @xmath166 and 40 @xmath155 while we calculated the me couplings in the dynamical limit . </S>",

    "<S> discussion *    anchoring first - principles calculations to the right microscopic hamiltonian is crucial to understand the me couplings in complex multiferroic systems . with two sets of spin - current polarizations derived from the two distinct structural distortions , </S>",
