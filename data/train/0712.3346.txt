    "it is worth mentioning that the nonlocal chiral quark model ( n@xmath3qm ) , derived from the instanton qcd vacuum , has been successfully applied to describing low - energy properties of hadrons  @xcite . especially for the pseudoscalar ( ps )",
    "mesonic sector , we have carried out several theoretical works which turn out to describe experimental data quantitatively well and are compatible with other model calculations  @xcite .",
    "the effective chiral action consists of quark and ( anti)instanton interaction , encoded in the thooft @xmath4-interaction  @xcite .",
    "having bosonized it , the effective chiral action is reconstructed in terms of the quark and nonlinear ps meson background fields .",
    "we start directly with the euclidean effective chiral action in the presence of the external electromagnetic field , which was constructed to satisfy the gauge invariance , explicitly as follows  @xcite : @xmath5= -{\\rm sp}\\ln\\left[i\\rlap{/}{d}+i\\hat{m}+\\sqrt{m(id)}u_5\\sqrt{m(id ) } \\right],\\ ] ] where the @xmath6 stands for the functional trace running over space - time @xmath7 , color , flavor and dirac spin spaces .",
    "the @xmath8 denotes the covariant derivative with an external vector current : @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath10 is the current - quark mass matrix , @xmath11 considering isospin symmetry ( @xmath12 ) . the nonlinear background goldstone boson field ,",
    "@xmath13 is defined as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 stands for the pion weak decay constant , set to be @xmath16 mev .",
    "the momentum - dependent quark mass , @xmath17 arises from the fourier transform of the quark zero - mode solution @xmath18 : @xmath19\\psi_0=0,\\ ] ] where the @xmath20 is the ( anti)instanton solution satisfying the self - dual condition for the gluon field strength tensor , @xmath21 . throughout the present talk",
    ", we exploit the singular - gauge solution for @xmath20  @xcite . for simplicity and better numerical calculation",
    ", we introduce a parameterization of the dipole - type form factor for the momentum - dependent quark mass : @xmath22 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 mev , and @xmath24 is determined self - consistently via the saddle - point equation of the model , resulting in about @xmath25 mev as usual for the mesonic sector .",
    "we want to emphasize on the fact that there is no adjustable free parameters within the model . in other words ,",
    "the present model is highly constrained .",
    "in this section , we briefly explain how to compute the pion em ff at nonzero quark density as in ref .  @xcite . in the left panel of figure  [ fig0 ]",
    "we depict the numerical result for the em ff for the vacuum ( @xmath26 , thick solid line ) , and it is well reproduced in comparison to available experimental data .",
    "moreover , the radius @xmath27 calculated from the em ff becomes @xmath28 , which is in good agreement with the experimental value @xmath29",
    "@xcite .",
    "now , we are in a position to discuss the way to include the quark number chemical potential ( @xmath30 ) in the model .",
    "since we are in the chiral limit for @xmath31 , the isovector part of the quark number chemical potential is zero .",
    "hence , we will consider only the isoscalar one hereafter . as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , a simple replacement is enough for this purpose : @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "then the effective chiral action of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eca ] ) can be modified as follows : @xmath34 = -{\\rm sp}\\ln\\left[i\\rlap{/}{d } ' + i\\sqrt{{\\cal m}(id ' ) } u_5\\sqrt{{\\cal m}(id')}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 .",
    "the momentum - dependent quark mass is also modified with the nonzero @xmath30 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mdqm ] ) as follows : @xmath36 ^ 2={\\cal m}_0{\\cal f}^2(i\\partial,\\mu).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we assume the small density limit , we take @xmath37 to remain intact in medium .",
    "we verified that this simple form factor reproduce the exact zero mode with the finite @xmath30 qualitatively well . with this modification of the effective chiral action",
    ", we obtain the numerical results for the pion em ff with respect to the nonzero @xmath30 ( thin solid lines ) as depicted in the left panel of figure  [ fig0 ] .",
    "we draw them for the @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 mev separately .",
    "we observe that the value of the pion em ff at @xmath42 becomes larger as the @xmath30 increases . at the same time",
    ", the slope at @xmath42 , which corresponds to the pion em charge radius , increases with respect to the @xmath30 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the em ff of the pion in the time - like region ( @xmath43 ) can be written in a simple parameterization in terms of the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) as follows  @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the mass and full decay width of the @xmath0 meson in free space .",
    "the coefficient @xmath47 is introduced for the normalization to match with the experimental data .",
    "for instance , these values can be chosen as @xmath48 gev , @xmath49 gev and @xmath50 to produce the dilepton data  @xcite in free space .",
    "now , we make an assumption to proceed the discussion : even in the case of the nonzero quark number chemical potential ( @xmath51 ) , the em ff of the pion follows the same form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : emffvmd ] ) by only replacing @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "note that the superscripted asterisk ( @xmath55 ) indicates that they depend on the @xmath30 .",
    "more generally , they must be expressed as fucntions of @xmath30 as well as of the temperature @xmath56 .",
    "the situation considered in the present work is , however , chosen to be @xmath57 for simplicity hereafter .",
    "then , the @xmath0-meson mass for the nonzero @xmath30 can be obtained by the following expression : @xmath58^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 and @xmath60 can be computed using the n@xmath3qm as shown previously . in the right panel of figure  [ fig0 ]",
    "we show the corresponding numerical results , where @xmath61 denotes the baryon number chemical potential being equal to @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath63 corresponds to the normal nuclear density @xmath64 , and is chosen to be about @xmath65 mev , the system being assumed in free quark - gas phase .",
    "we clearly see that the @xmath0-meson mass decreases with respect to the quark chemical potential , @xmath30 . to see this behavior in a qualitative manner , we employ the following linear parameterization for the mass shift of the @xmath0-meson : @xmath66",
    "if we determine the value of @xmath67 from the end points ( @xmath68 ) , we have @xmath69 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath67 was estimated to be around @xmath70 , which is similar to that based on phenomenological method in ref .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath0-meson mass drops suddenly as the @xmath30 increases in ref .",
    "@xcite using the lattice simulation in terms of su(2 ) color symmetry .",
    "it was also noted that , from the chiral models , the @xmath0-meson pole moves very differently in the complex plane for @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "in this talk , we have investigated the @xmath0-meson mass shift in medium in terms of the pion electromagnetic charge radius , which was computed as a function of the quark number chemical potential within the framework of the nonlocal chiral quark model .",
    "in addition , the vector meson dominance was employed to express the pion em charge radius associated with the @xmath0-meson mass . when we took a phenomenological parameterization for the mass shift , @xmath72 , @xmath67 turned out to be about @xmath73 which was compatible to the estimate from the qcd sum rule and phenomenological estimations ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "although we note that there are ambiguities in theoretical calculations , they will not alter the qualitative consequences much .",
    "a detailed work on the present talk will appear elsewhere  @xcite .",
