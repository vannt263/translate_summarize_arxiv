    "high - order radiative corrections to different amplitudes and cross section become nowadays more and more important both in qed and qcd . in qed",
    "this is due to the high precision of the modern spectroscopy experiments , while in qcd the radiative corrections play important role due to the strength of the interaction .",
    "the radiative corrections are expressed in terms of the loop integrals , so the possibility to calculate the latter is also very important .",
    "several powerful techniques have been developed for the calculation of the multiloop integrals . among them",
    "is the ibp ( integration - by - part ) reduction procedure @xcite , which allows one to reduce arbitrary loop integral to some finite set of master integrals .",
    "owing to ibp reduction , the problem of calculation of loop integrals is reduced to the calculation of master integrals .",
    "it is important to understand that ibp reduction also helps in the calculation of the master integrals . indeed , differentiating the master integral with respect to some external invariant or mass , we obtain linear combination of integrals of the same topology or its subtopologies . applying ibp reduction procedure , we can express this combination via the same set of master integrals .",
    "acting in this way , one can obtain the system of ordinary differential equations for all master integrals @xcite .",
    "the general solution of this system depends on several constants parametrizing the solution of the corresponding homogeneous system .",
    "these constants can be fixed from the value of the integrals at some specific kinematic parameters , or from their asymptotics in which one invariant becomes big , or small , in comparison with others .",
    "this method can be applied to the integrals with several external parameters .    however ,",
    "the integrals with one scale are also important for the applications . for them , the method of differential equations does not work and one has to rely on other methods .",
    "in addition to the direct calculation using , e.g. , mellin - barnes representation , one can try the method of difference equations .",
    "one of the variants of the difference equation is described by laporta in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this method one considers the generalized master integral which is formed by raising one of the massive denominators of the master integral of interest to arbitrary power @xmath1 . using ibp reduction one can obtain the difference equation with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "the part , corresponding to the general solution of the homogeneous equation is then fixed from the large-@xmath1 asymptotics . the resulting expression for the master integral",
    "has the form of factorial series with power - like ( harmonic ) convergence ( the general term of the series falls down as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the summation variable , @xmath4 ) .",
    "this method has been successfully applied for several multiloop tadpole integrals , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . due to the power - like convergence of sums ,",
    "the difficulties of obtaining high - precision results rapidly grow with the number of digits .",
    "the multi - digit results , on the other hand , are important for the ` pslq ` algorithm @xcite , which allows one to restore the analytical result from the high - precision numerical one , provided the basis of transcedental numbers is known .",
    "another variant of the difference equation is the dimensional recurrence relation connecting the master integrals in different dimensions , suggested by tarasov in ref .",
    "we remind , that , in contrast to the differential equation , where the solution of the homogeneous equation is parametrized by several arbitrary constants , in the case of difference equation the corresponding solution is parametrized by several arbitrary periodic functions . in refs .",
    "@xcite the large-@xmath0 asymptotics has been used for fixing these functions .",
    "this asymptotics has been derived from the explicit parametric form of the integrals . however , for multiloop integrals the calculation of this asymptotics appears to be hardly accessible .",
    "this is why the method of the dimensional recurrence relation was mainly applied to the calculation of one - loop integrals .",
    "it is worth noting that for the case of several external invariants , one may rely on the combination of differential and difference equations methods , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite the method of the dimensional recurrence relation was successfully applied to the calculation of certain four - loop tadpole . in that paper , an arbitrary periodic function parametrizing the solution of the homogeneous equation",
    "was numerically shown to be equal to zero by using the laporta - like difference equation with respect to the power of massive denominator .",
    "however this vanishing of the homogeneous part was rather an exception than a rule , and in many known cases the homogeneous part is not zero .",
    "needless to say that in these cases the correct choice of the periodic functions not only can be hardly justified , but plainly difficult to guess . on the other hand , all examples of application of the dimensional recurrence relation show that results obtained with the help of this method",
    "have a form of exponentially converging series ( the general term of the series falls down as @xmath5 , where @xmath3 is the summation variable , @xmath6 ) .",
    "the rapid convergence of these series allows one to use the ` pslq ` algorithm to express their @xmath7-expansion in terms of conventional transcedental numbers , like multiple zeta - functions .    in this paper ,",
    "we describe a method of the calculation of loop integrals based on the usage of tarasov s dimensional recurrence relation .",
    "the key point of our approach is the use of the analytical properties of the integrals as functions of the complex variable @xmath0 .",
    "these properties allow one to fix the periodic functions up to some constants which can be found from the calculation of the integral at some definite @xmath0 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section , we introduce notations and formulate a general path of finding the master integrals . in section iii",
    "we briefly analyse the analytical properties of the parametric representation needed for our consideration . in section",
    "iv we give several examples of the application of the formulated approach .",
    "section v contains discussions of the generalization of the formulated approach to the topologies with more than one master integral .",
    "the last section gives short conclusion .",
    "assume that we are interested in the calculation of the @xmath8-loop integral depending on @xmath9 linearly independent external momenta @xmath10 .",
    "there are @xmath11 scalar products depending on the loop momenta @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the loop integral has the form@xmath16 where the scalar functions @xmath17 are linear polynomials with respect to @xmath18 .",
    "the functions @xmath17 are assumed to be linearly independent and to form a complete basis in the sense that any non - zero linear combination of them depends on the loop momenta , and any @xmath19 can be expressed in terms of @xmath17 . for further purposes",

    "@xcite may be represented as follows@xmath23 where @xmath24 numerate the chords of the tree , and @xmath25 for the euclidean / pseudoeuclidean case , respectively .",
    "it is natural to label this relation as a raising one since it expresses any integral in @xmath26 dimensions via the integrals in @xmath0 dimensions",
    ". it may be also convenient to use the lowering dimensional relation which we will obtain now .",
    "our derivation is based on the baikov s approach @xcite in which one passes from the integration over loop momenta to the integration over scalar products",
    ". the master formula can be represented as@xmath27 } \\nonumber\\\\ &   \\times\\int\\left (   \\prod_{i=1}^{l}\\prod_{j = i}^{l+e}ds_{ij}\\right ) \\frac{\\left [   v\\left (   l_{2},\\ldots l_{l},p_{1},\\ldots , p_{e}\\right )   \\right ] ^{\\left (   \\mathcal{d}-e - l-1\\right )   /2}}{\\left [   v\\left (   p_{1},\\ldots , p_{e}\\right )   \\right ]   ^{\\left (   \\mathcal{d}-e-1\\right )   /2}}% f,\\label{eq : baikov}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where@xmath28 is a gram determinant constructed on the vectors @xmath29 and @xmath30 is arbitrary function of scalar products @xmath18 . for our purposes , of course , we choose @xmath31   ^{-1}$ ] . due to the aforementioned properties of basis @xmath32 , the function @xmath33 has the form of some polynomial of degree @xmath34 of @xmath35 ( and of external invariants , which is not important for our purposes):@xmath36 replacing @xmath37 in eq .",

    "so , for computer implementation the lowering dimensional relation can be more convenient . on the other hand , eq.([eq : raising ] ) is more `` economic '' since the right - hand side of it contains integrals with indices shifted by at most @xmath8 , while the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lowering ] ) may contain integrals with indices shifted by @xmath34 .",
    "of course , after ibp reduction , both raising and lowering recurrence relations are equivalent .    in case",

    "( [ eq : raising ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ eq : lowering ] ) is master integral , ibp reduction of the right - hand side gives a difference equation for this master integral .",

    ", we can obtain in the same way a system of difference equations for them .",
    "we will concentrate below on the case of one master integral in the topology of interest .",
    "the discussion of the case of several - master topology is given in section v. so , after the ibp reduction we obtain from , e.g. , raising relation the following dimensional recurrence relation@xmath39 where @xmath40 is non - homogeneous part constructed of the master integrals of subtopologies in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "the coefficient @xmath41 is a rational function of @xmath0 which can always be represented as@xmath42 where @xmath43 is some constant , and @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) are the zeros of the numerator ( denominator ) .",

    "this decomposition also determines the corresponding decomposition @xmath62 such that@xmath63    the general solution reads@xmath64   ^{k}\\frac{\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{n}\\left (   \\frac{\\mathcal{d}}% { 2}+1-a_{i}\\right )   _ { k}}{\\prod\\limits_{j=1}^{m}\\left (   \\frac{\\mathcal{d}}% { 2}+1-b_{j}\\right )   _ { k}}r_{+}\\left (   \\mathcal{d}+2k\\right )   , \\nonumber\\\\ s_{-}\\left (   \\mathcal{d},k\\right )    &   = \\frac{r_{-}\\left (   \\mathcal{d}% -2k\\right )   } { \\sigma\\left (   \\mathcal{d}\\right )   } = c^{-1-k}\\frac{\\prod \\limits_{j=1}^{m}\\left (   b_{j}-\\frac{\\mathcal{d}}{2}\\right )   _ { k+1}}% { \\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{n}\\left (   a_{i}-\\frac{\\mathcal{d}}{2}\\right )   _ { k+1}% } r_{-}\\left (   \\mathcal{d}-2k\\right )   .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the specific nonhomogeneous solution does not depend on the particular choice of the summing factor .",
    "eq.([eq : general ] ) clearly demonstrates that , in order to find @xmath65 , we have to fix the periodic function @xmath66 .",
    "this function can be conveniently understood as a function of the complex variable @xmath67 and below we switch the notations @xmath68 .",
    "understanding @xmath69 as a function of @xmath70 , we automatically account for the periodicity due to identity @xmath71 .",

    "the integral @xmath74 in the left - hand side is not known ( this is the purpose of our investigation ) , but we can discover some of its analytical properties from , e.g. , its parametric representation . note that we do not have to analyse the integral in the whole complex plane of @xmath0 , but only in an arbitrary stripe of width @xmath75 , i.e. , in @xmath76 , which we will call the _ basic stripe_. the factor @xmath49 is also a known analytical function of @xmath0 .",
    "this allows us to fix @xmath72 up to some constant which can be found from the value of the integral @xmath65 at one given value of @xmath0 .",
    "there is a number of technical conveniencies in this approach .",
    "first , as we have said above , the summing factor @xmath77 can be chosen in different forms and we are free to choose the one with the most convenient analytical properties .",
    "second , we can pass from using one integral of certain topology as a master to using another integral of the same topology as a master . finally , we are free to choose the convenient basic stipe in which we perform the analysis .",
    "so , summarizing , the suggested path of finding a master integral is the following ( we assume we can do ibp reduction ) :    1 .",
    "make sure all master integrals in subtopologies are known .",
    "if it is not so , start from calculating them .",

    "fix the singularities of this function by analysing the analytical properties of the master integrals and summing factor .",

    "the step 5 is the key point of our approach .",
