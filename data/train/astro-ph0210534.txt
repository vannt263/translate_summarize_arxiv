    "in the last few years the study of light echoes in supernovae ( sne ) has become rather fashionable , since they provide a potential tool to perform a detailed tomography of the sn environment ( crotts @xcite , and references therein ) and , in turn , can give important insights into the progenitor s nature .",
    "the problem has been addressed by several authors ( see for example chevalier @xcite , schaefer @xcite and sparks @xcite ) and therefore here we will give only a brief introduction to the light echo phenomenon in the single scattering approximation .",
    "for this purpose , let us imagine the sn immersed in a dusty medium at a distance @xmath0 from the observer .",
    "if we then consider the sn event as a radiation flash , whose duration @xmath1 is so small that @xmath2 , at any given time the light echo generated by the sn light scattered into the line of sight is confined in an ellipsoid , whose foci coincide with the observer and the sn itself .    in the sn surroundings",
    ", this ellipsoid can be very well approximated by a paraboloid , with the sn lying in its focus . if we introduce a coordinates system centred on the source , with the @xmath3 axis coinciding with the line of sight ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] ) , then the equation of this paraboloid can be written as    @xmath4     axis is perpendicular to the sheet plane . ]    where @xmath5 is the time delay between the arrivals of scattered and direct photons , which left the sn at the same instant .",
    "it is clear that the paraboloid can be regarded as the locus containing all scattering elements which produce a constant @xmath5 and for this reason we will refer to it as the iso  delay surface .",
    "let us now consider an infinitesimal volume element @xmath6 lying on such a iso - delay surface defined by a given @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath7 is the number of photons emitted per unit time by the sn , the flux of scattered photons per unit time and unit area which reach the observer at time @xmath8 with a delay @xmath5 is    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the distance of the volume element to the sn , @xmath11 is the number density of scattering particles , @xmath12 is the scattering cross - section , @xmath13 is the dust albedo , @xmath14 is the scattering angle defined by @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the scattering phase function , normalized in order to have @xmath17 . for the sake of simplicity , in the following we will assume that the dust density depends only on @xmath18 and that the scattering medium is characterized by an axial symmetry around the @xmath3 axis . with this simplifying hypothesis ,",
    "the infinitesimal volume element can be expressed as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the impact parameter ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : geometry ] ) .",
    "then , if we set    @xmath21    we can finally write the total scattered flux received by the observer at time @xmath8 as :    @xmath22    while the total flux is simply @xmath23 . from eq .  [ eq : f ] it is clear that the outcoming scattered signal is the result of a convolution , and therefore at any given time @xmath8 the observer will receive a combined signal , which contains a mixture of photons emitted by the sn in the whole time range @xmath24 .    as usual in this kind of studies ( cfr .",
    "chevalier @xcite ) , we have adopted the henyey & greenstein scattering phase function @xmath16 , which includes the degree of forward scattering through the parameter @xmath25 ( @xmath26=0 corresponds to an isotropic scattering while @xmath26=1 indicates a complete forward scattering ) both empirical estimates and numerical calculations ( white @xcite ) give @xmath270.6 , while for the dust albedo we have adopted @xmath280.6 ( mathis , rumpl & nordsiek @xcite ) .",
    "[ eq : f ] can be solved numerically , using the observed light curve of a typical ia to get @xmath7 , but some instructive results can be obtained analytically .",
    "in fact , the light curve of a ia can be well approximated by a flash ( @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath7=0 for @xmath31 ) , and this makes the solution of eq .",
    "[ eq : f ] very simple .",
    "the flash duration can be computed from the observed light curve as @xmath32 , and turns out to be of the order of 0.1 years for a ia .    after normalizing to the sn luminosity at maximum , we have @xmath33 , so that one is left with the solution of eq .",
    "[ eq : f ] only . in general",
    ", this requires a numerical integration , even though a few analytical solutions exist ( chevalier @xcite ) .",
    "the problem becomes particularly simple if one assumes an isotropic scattering ( @xmath34 ) and a constant density ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "under these assumptions , the resulting echo luminosity has a very low time dependency and therefore , once the light echo radiation overcomes that of the sn , the light curve is expected to decline very slowly ( @xmath360.05 mag yr@xmath37 ) and , depending on the dust cloud extension , to brighten for many years .",
    "what is interesting to note here is that the integrated echo luminosity is mostly governed by the dust density and depends only mildly on the geometry of the scattering material . for typical values of the cross section ( 6@xmath3810@xmath39 @xmath40 ) and dust density ( 10 @xmath41 ) ,",
    "the light echo is expected to take place at about 10 magnitudes below the sn maximum , and thus it would dominate the total luminosity starting at about two years after the explosion . at such epochs , the color of the object is expected to turn blue and the spectrum to show an abrupt change from the nebular appearance to a rather weird aspect , being a mixture of all spectra shown by the sn all the way back to the explosion .",
    "this effect , which makes the study of late phases particularly cumbersome in such _ unlucky _",
    "cases , was actually seen in the two known events , which are described in the next section .",
    "the first detection of a light echo in a ia occurred for sn  1991 t ( schmidt et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which started to deviate from the usual exponential decline at about 1.5 years past maximum , when it settled on a much slower decline tail and showed unprecedented blue spectra .",
    "the existence of a light echo was definitely confirmed by the hst images taken between 1996 and 1998 , which have indeed shown a resolved structure ( 2r@xmath360@xmath42.4 ) evolving with time ( sparks et al .",
    "this implied the presence of dust within @xmath3650 pc from the sn .",
    "the only other known case is that of sn  1998bu ( cappellaro et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which so far has shown a photometric and spectroscopic behaviour very similar to that of sn  1991 t . due to this similarity , cappellaro et al .",
    "@xcite have modelled both light echoes using a thin sheet of dust , perpendicular to the line of sight and located at a distance @xmath43 in front of the sn .",
    "the implied optical depth was kept fixed at the value inferred from the estimated extinction @xmath44 , i.e. 0.46 for 1991 t ( phillips et al .",
    "@xcite ) and 0.86 for 1998bu ( jha et al .",
    "@xcite ) , so that the echo and the observed reddening are consistently explained . in this respect ,",
    "we note that the total equivalent widths @xmath45 of nai  d lines for the two objects are 1.6  ( patat et al . in preparation ) and 0.7  ( munari et al .",
    "@xcite ) respectively . therefore ,",
    "if a relation between @xmath45 and @xmath44 really exists , we do not have understood it yet very well ( see also turatto , these proceedings ) .    with this simplifying assumptions , the solution of eq .",
    "[ eq : f ] becomes very simple and contains one single free parameter , namely the distance @xmath43 between the sn and the dust cloud .",
    "the reproduction of the observed data , both spectroscopic and photometric , is fairly good ( see cappellaro et al . @xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] here ) and allows one to estimate this distance . in the case of sn  1991 t , this turns out to be @xmath3640pc , while for 1998bu the inferred value is @xmath3680pc . at the distance of ngc  3368 , this implies a diameter of about 0@xmath42.3 , and therefore the light echo was expected to be resolved by hst .",
    "this was confirmed by wfpc2 observations performed at 762 days after maximum by garnavich et al .",
    "@xcite , who reported the presence of two main features : a ring with a diameter of 0@xmath42.48 and a barely resolved inner disk ( 2r@xmath360@xmath42.14 ) , which indicates the presence of scattering material within 10pc from the sn .",
    "now , it is quite intriguing that both sne exploded in sab - liner galaxies ( ngc  4527 and ngc  3368 ) which show and enhanced star forming rate .",
    "moreover , both sne were slow decliners , even though we must say that sn  1998bu was not so extreme as sn  1991 t and did not share its spectroscopic peculiarities .",
    "these facts go in the same direction of the body of evidences collected in the last ten years concerning the possible relation between the sn characteristics and the host galaxy morphological type ( van den bergh & pazder , @xcite , hamuy et al .",
    "@xcite,@xcite , howell @xcite ) .",
    "these studies have rather convincingly demonstrated that the sub - luminous events are preferentially found in early type galaxies ( e / s0 ) , while the super - luminous ones ( 1991t - like ) tend to occur in spirals ( sbc or later ) .",
    "what is important to underline here , is that 1991t - like events seem to be associated with young environments and are , therefore , the most promising candidates for the study of light echoes . or , in turn , if echoes are detected around such kind of sne , this would strengthen their association with sites of relatively recent star formation .",
    "the sample of known light echoes is by far too small to draw any significant conclusion and therefore we badly need to improve on the statistics .",
    "the most promising case during the last years was represented by sn  1998es in ngc  632 .",
    "this sn , in fact , was classified as a 1991t - like by jha et al .",
    "@xcite , who also noticed that the parent galaxy was classified as an s0 , hosting a nuclear starburst ( pogge & eskridge @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the sn was reported to be projected very close to a star forming region and an high resolution spectrum showed interstellar nai  d features very similar to those of 1991 t ( patat et al . in preparation ) , indicating the presence of a significant amount of material in front of the sn ( @xmath45=1.46  ) .",
    "a 1991t - like echo at the distance of ngc632 ( 43 mpc , @xmath46= 75 km s@xmath37 mpc@xmath37 ) would have a magnitude @xmath4724 and therefore an 8m - class telescope is required . for this purpose , we have imaged ngc  632 in @xmath48 and @xmath49 with vlt - fors2 on september 25 , 2001 .",
    "a careful analysis of the data did not reveal any stellar object at the expected position .",
    "due to the good image quality achieved in the 1800 sec @xmath48 stacked image ( 0@xmath42.64 ) and the smooth galaxy background , we could set an upper limit for the integrated echo luminosity of @xmath50 .",
    "there are two possible explanations for this non - detection .",
    "the first comes from the fact that , in the hypothesis of a thin sheet and @xmath51 , the echo luminosity is proportional to @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the dust optical depth along the line of sight to the sn .",
    "therefore , if we assume that @xmath53 is the same as in the case of 1991 t ( as the high resolution spectra seem to tell us ) , it is sufficient to place the dust sheet @xmath364 times further away ( @xmath54150 pc ) to produce a light echo 1.5 mag fainter than in 1991 t ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] , dashed line ) .",
    "another reasonable explanation , given the poor time coverage of sn  1998es , is the possible confinement of the dust to a small cloud in front of the sn .",
    "in fact , if @xmath55 is the radius of a spherical cloud at a distance @xmath43 from the sn , the iso - delay surface will stop to intercept the scattering material approximately for @xmath56 .",
    "for example , for @xmath43=120 lyr and @xmath55=25 lyr , the echo would last 2.6 years only . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] we have plotted the numerical solution one obtains in this case ( dotted line ) .",
    "we remark that , unfortunately , it is impossible to put meaningful constraints for @xmath43 and @xmath55 , due to the very poor photometric coverage at late phases .",
    "the fors2 images were very deep , the combined @xmath48 frames reaching a 5@xmath57 peak limiting magnitude of @xmath3627 for unresolved objects .",
    "despite the fact that such deep data did not show the light echo , they led to the serendipitous discovery of a very faint tidal tail ( patat , carraro & romaniello @xcite ) , which extends for at least 50 kpc .",
    "this discovery strongly supports the suggestion made by chitre & joshi @xcite that ngc  632 is probably the result of a galaxy merger , which in turn is the responsible for the observed nuclear / circum - nuclear starburst .",
    "light echoes have several applications , which should be exploited in the future .",
    "being generated by reflections , they are strongly polarized , with a maximum in the polarization degree at @xmath58/2 .",
    "this , in principle , can give a direct estimate of the distance ( sparks @xcite ) .",
    "the hst light echo follow - up also allows one to determine the distance to the sn , provided that the geometry of the dust distribution is to some extent known .    finally , and in our opinion",
    "most important of all , more sophisticated models applied to high quality photometric and spectroscopic data can provide useful information on the dust properties , its distribution around the progenitor and possibly give some hints on its nature .",
