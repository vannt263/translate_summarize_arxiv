    "the experimental results from cdf @xcite at tevatron , star @xcite and phenix @xcite at rhic and alice @xcite and lhcb @xcite at lhc for photon - induced processes in hadronic collisions have demonstrated in the last years that a detailed analysis is feasible and that the data can be used to constrain the description of the hadronic structure at high energies as well as to probe possible scenarios for the physics beyond the standard model ( for reviews see ref .",
    "recently , the status of photon - photon and photon - hadron interactions in @xmath1 collisions has been reviewed in a dedicated workshop at cern @xcite .",
    "moreover , the upcoming experimental data and new observables which could be studied in future runs of the lhc have been discussed in detail .",
    "in particular , it is now clear that the first experimental data for the exclusive @xmath0 photoproduction in @xmath2 and @xmath3 collisions will be available in the next months .",
    "such process was studied by several theoretical groups considering different formalisms and underlying assumptions @xcite .",
    "for example , the current predictions derived from the color dipole formalism @xcite were obtained using different treatments for dependence of the cross section on the squared momentum transfer @xmath4 and distinct models for the @xmath0 wave function and/or for the forward dipole - proton scattering amplitude @xmath5 .",
    "such differences render the interpretation of the results a hard task .",
    "our goal in this paper is to update the color dipole predictions for the @xmath0 production and compare the results obtained considering different models for @xmath5 and for the @xmath0 wave function and also different assumptions for the @xmath4-dependence of the cross section .",
    "we want to estimate the theoretical uncertainty present in the current predictions in the literature ( for similar studies for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 production see refs .",
    "@xcite , respectively ) .",
    "we start our study discussing the exclusive @xmath0 photoproduction at hera and compare our predictions with the scarce experimental data .",
    "after that we present our predictions for the rapidity distribution and total cross sections for the exclusive photoproduction of @xmath0 in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath8 and 14 tev as well as in @xmath3 collisions at @xmath9 tev .",
    "we also present our predictions of the total cross sections in the kinematical range probed by the lhcb collaboration .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present a brief review of photon - hadron interactions in @xmath2 and @xmath3 collisions , as well as of the color dipole formalism for the exclusive @xmath0 photoproduction .",
    "we also present the models for the dipole - target scattering amplitude and @xmath0 wave functions used in our calculations . in section [ resultados ] we present our predictions for the exclusive photoproduction of @xmath0 in @xmath10 collisions and a comparison with the hera data is also shown .",
    "finally , in section [ sumario ] we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "in hadronic collisions at large impact parameter ( @xmath11 ) and at ultra relativistic energies the electromagnetic interaction is expected to be dominant . in this regime",
    ", the cross sections for a given process can be factorized in terms of the equivalent flux of photons of the hadron projectile and the photon - target production cross section @xcite . in particular , the rapidity distribution for the exclusive @xmath0 photoproduction in hadronic collisions is given by @xmath12}{dy } = \\left[\\omega \\frac{dn}{d\\omega}|_{h_1}\\,\\sigma_{\\gamma h_2 \\rightarrow \\upsilon \\otimes h_2}\\left(\\omega \\right)\\right]_{\\omega_l } + \\left[\\omega \\frac{dn}{d\\omega}|_{h_2}\\,\\sigma_{\\gamma h_1 \\rightarrow \\upsilon \\otimes h_1}\\left(\\omega \\right)\\right]_{\\omega_r}\\ , \\label{dsigdy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the rapidity ( @xmath13 ) of the @xmath0 in the final state is determined by the photon energy @xmath14 in the collider frame and by mass @xmath15 of the vector meson [ @xmath16 .",
    "the symbol @xmath17 represents the presence of a rapidity gap in the final state and @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote photons from the @xmath20 and @xmath21 hadrons , respectively .",
    "the equivalent photon spectrum @xmath22 of a relativistic proton is given by @xcite , @xmath23   \\left ( \\ln{\\omega } - \\frac{11}{6 } + \\frac{3}{\\omega }   - \\frac{3}{2 \\,\\omega^2 } + \\frac{1}{3 \\,\\omega^3 } \\right ) \\",

    "the equivalent photon flux of a nuclei is assumed to be given by @xcite @xmath28\\ , \\label{fluxint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the modified bessel functions of second kind and @xmath31 , which is enhanced by a factor @xmath32 in comparison to the proton one .",
    "it is important to observe that the photon fluxes , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : photon_spectrum ] ) and ( [ fluxint ] ) , have support at small values of @xmath14 , decreasing exponentially at large @xmath14 . consequently , the first term on the right - hand side of the eq .",
    "( [ dsigdy ] ) peaks at positive rapidities while the second term peaks at negative rapidities .",
    "moreover , given the photon flux , the study of the rapidity distribution can be used to constrain the photoproduction cross section at a given energy . finally , due to the differences between the equivalent photon flux of the proton and of the nucleus , the rapidity distribution of the @xmath0 s produced in @xmath3 collisions",
    "will be asymmetric and determined by @xmath33 interactions , with the photon coming from the nucleus .",
    "in contrast , the rapidity distribution for @xmath2 collisions will be symmetric with respect to @xmath34 .    in the color dipole formalism",
    "the @xmath35 scattering is described in the dipole frame , in which most of the energy is carried by the hadron , while the photon has just enough energy to dissociate into a quark - antiquark pair before the scattering . in this representation",
    "the probing projectile fluctuates into a quark - antiquark pair ( a dipole ) with transverse separation @xmath36 long before the interaction , which then scatters off the hadron @xcite . in this formalism",
    ", the scattering amplitude for the diffractive photoproduction of an exclusive final state , such as a @xmath0 , in a @xmath33 collision is given by ( see e.g. refs .",

    "the variable @xmath39 @xmath40 is the longitudinal momentum fraction of the quark ( antiquark ) , @xmath41 denotes the transverse momentum lost by the outgoing proton ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 is the bjorken variable .",
    "the variable @xmath44 is the transverse distance from the center of the target to the center of mass of the @xmath45 dipole and the factor in the exponential arises when one takes into account non - forward corrections to the wave functions @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath46 denotes the non - forward scattering amplitude of a dipole of size @xmath36 on the proton , which is directly related to the qcd dynamics ( see below ) .",
    "the differential cross section for exclusive @xmath0 photoproduction is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the ratio of real to imaginary parts of the scattering amplitude and @xmath49 is the skewness factor , which is associated to the fact that the gluons attached to the @xmath50 pair can carry different light - cone fractions @xmath43 , @xmath51 of the proton . in the limit that @xmath52 and at small @xmath4 and assuming that the gluon density has a power - law form @xmath53 , it is given by @xcite @xmath54}{\\partial\\ln(1/x)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] moreover , @xmath48 can be calculated using dispersion relations , being given by @xmath55 .",
    "the total cross section is given by @xmath56 in what follows , we will also calculate the total cross section considering an approximation frequently used in the literature , in which an exponential ansatz for the @xmath4-dependence is assumed for the differential cross section , which implies that @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the slope parameter . as in ref .",

    "initially let us discuss the models used for the overlap function .",
    "in contrast to the photon wave function , which is well known in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the description of the @xmath0 wave function still is an open question . the simplest approach is to assume that the vector meson is predominantly a quark - antiquark state and that the spin and polarization structure is the same as in the photon @xcite . as a consequence , the overlap between the photon and the vector meson wave function , for the transversely polarized case",
