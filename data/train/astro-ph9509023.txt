    "the all - sky survey by the compton gamma ray observatory has led to the detection of a number of high - energy gamma ray sources with the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) .",
    "egret covers the high - energy gamma ray range from about 30 mev to over 20 gev .",
    "it produces an image of a circular region of the sky with maximum sensitivity at the center of the field of view , falling to half at about 18from the center and to one - sixth at 30 .",
    "individual photons are detected with an angular accuracy which varies with the photon energy from about 0.5 degrees at the highest energy to 10 degrees at the lowest .",
    "the properties of the instrument are discussed by kanbach et al .",
    "( 1988 , 1989 ) and by thompson et al .",
    "( 1993a ) .",
    "the full sky survey provided for the first time an opportunity to study in detail high - energy gamma ray emission from point sources as well as from extended regions of diffuse emission .",
    "individual observations , typically one to three weeks long , provided an opportunity to examine the emission from potential point sources while adding all the observations during the survey allowed weak , steady sources to be enhanced . this analysis covers phase 1 and phase 2 of the cgro observing plan , from the spacecraft s launch in april 1991 to august 1993 .",
    "this paper covers the detected point sources whose galactic latitude is between + 10and + 40 .",
    "sixty - five separate observations contributed useful data for this region .",
    "other portions of the sky are discussed in other papers ( dingus et al . 1995 ; lin et al .",
    "1995b ; sreekumar et al .",
    "1995 ; bertsch et al .",
    "the sky is divided into zones of different galactic latitude for two reasons .",
    "first , different types of point sources are found in different parts of the sky .",
    "the pulsars which egret has detected are all within a few degrees of the galactic plane ( thompson et al .",
    "1994 ) , and it is possible that many other point sources belong to other galactic populations . above 10 degrees of latitude ,",
    "it is likely that the sources are predominantly extragalactic .",
    "second , the galactic diffuse emission has a strong influence on the ability to distinguish point sources . within 10 degrees of the galactic plane ,",
    "most point sources are weak `` bumps '' on a strong , structured background . at higher latitudes ,",
    "the diffuse emission is much weaker and more uniform .",
    "the statistical criteria used in the data analysis are necessarily different at different latitudes .    the first egret catalog ( fichtel et al .",
    "1994a ) contains all the egret point sources detected in the phase 1 observations .",
    "this paper covers many of the same sources , but there are some differences . with more data ,",
    "positions and fluxes are known more precisely , and some marginal sources are now detected significantly .",
    "information on spectra and time variation are included here .",
    "some variable sources not detectable in phase 1 flared in phase 2 and became detectable . with an improved model of the galactic diffuse emission ,",
    "a number of spurious sources have been removed from the list .",
    "point sources can now be studied in the zone with @xmath1 , @xmath2 , which was omitted from the first catalog because of shortcomings in the old diffuse model .",
    "the second egret catalog ( thompson et al . 1995 ) will use the same data used here , but the point sources are not discussed in the same detail .",
    "this paper will not discuss the ophiuchus cloud , an extended gamma - ray source covered in detail by hunter et al .",
    "the standard egret processing operations were applied to the data ( bertsch _ et al . _ 1989 ) .",
    "maps were made of the number of photons detected in 0.5pixels and the instrument exposure was calculated for each pixel .",
    "photons out to 30from the center of the instrument field of view were accepted .",
    "maps were made for each individual viewing period as well as for the whole of phase 1 and 2 . a list of the viewing periods in phase 1 is contained in fichtel et al .",
    "( 1994a ) .",
    "the phase 1 and 2 viewing periods will be listed in the second egret catalog ( thompson et al . 1995 ) .",
    "source fluxes are derived by a maximum - likelihood analysis ( mattox et al .",
    "1996 ) which uses the detector point spread function to model any excess above a predicted map of the diffuse galactic emission ( bertsch et al .",
    "1993 , hunter et al . 1995 ) and a ( presumed extragalactic ) isotropic component .",
    "recent improvements in this prediction have made it possible to resolve point sources in the region @xmath1 , @xmath2 , which formerly had an implausible number of deviations from the diffuse model ( fichtel et al .",
    "the levels of the predicted galactic and isotropic diffuse emission are allowed to vary over limited regions in order to allow for local inaccuracies of the model .",
    "the statistical significance of a detected point source at a fixed position is estimated from its test statistic @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the likelihoods of the models with the source present and absent .",
    "the strengths of the source and the diffuse components are adjusted to maximize .",
    "if no real point source is present ,  at any chosen point on the sky will be a random variable distributed as @xmath6 ( mattox et al .",
    "1996 ) . thus  is approximately the significance of a detection , expressed in gaussian `` sigmas . ''    to search for possible point sources we first examined a map of the whole observation containing photons with energy @xmath7 mev .",
    "this choice has proven to be a useful compromise between the better angular resolution that could be obtained by using only higher - energy photons and the larger number of photons that could be obtained by admitting lower energies .",
    "a source is accepted for further analysis if @xmath8 .",
    "monte - carlo simulations show that there should be about 2 spurious sources in the whole sky with @xmath8 ( mattox et al .",
    "1996 ) , in agreement with with approximately gaussian distribution of .",
    "thus there should be less than one spurious detection in this region . to look for other sources with unusual spectra we also searched maps in other energy bands : 30100 mev , 100300 mev , 3001000 mev , and @xmath91000 mev .",
    "there were no new detections with @xmath8 .",
    "we also searched the individual viewing period maps and found no new sources .",
    "positions for point sources are estimated by mapping the value of .",
    "a trial point source is placed in many different locations ; a different  value is obtained at each .",
    "the maximum point is the most likely location of the source .",
    "confidence regions are chosen to be areas in which  is greater than a cutoff value .",
    "the cutoff is equal to the maximum  less the appropriate critical value of the @xmath10 distribution .",
    "the positions estimated here were derived in two different ways .",
    "first , the single e @xmath11 mev map was examined .",
    "second ,  maps for three energy bands ( 100300 mev , 3001000 mev , and @xmath91000 mev ) were added .",
    "the 30100 mev band was omitted because of its poor angular resolution in comparison with the others .",
    "for the objects studied here , the second procedure usually produces better results because it takes better advantage of the narrower point spread function at high energy .",
    "the smaller of the two confidence regions is reported here .",
    "there are still a few regions in which there are possible difficulties in the diffuse model , as shown by large , unsymmetric error regions , suspicious variation between energy bands , or concentrations of weak flux excesses .",
    "such cases will be noted for individual source detections .",
    "the positions of the detected point sources are compared with a list of candidate sources .",
    "the extreme agn portion of this list includes radio - loud ( @xmath12 jy ) quasars , ovv quasars , high - polarization quasars , superluminal objects , and bl lac objects ( fichtel et al .",
    "in addition a selection of prominent seyfert galaxies and radio - quiet quasars was added .",
    "many galactic objects were also included , such as pulsars , x - ray binaries , globular clusters , x - ray bursters , supernova remnants , and cos - b gamma - ray sources .",
    "the total number of candidates is slightly more than 1000 , of which roughly 200 fall between galactic latitudes + 10and + 40 . the probability of even one chance coincidence with an object from this list is less than 10% for a typical error circle of radius @xmath13 degree . approximately half of our detected sources can be identified with objects from this list , which indicates that most of the identifications are probably correct .",
    "spectra of the detected sources can be determined from the fluxes measured in the different energy bands .",
    "a power law form without breaks is assumed for the spectrum .",
    "a model spectrum is propagated through a model of the detector response function ( thompson et al .",
    "1993a ) and compared with the detected flux by a @xmath14 test .",
    "the normalization and spectral index are adjusted to obtain the best agreement with the data ( fichtel et al .",
    "the uncertainty in the spectral index is based on the size of the region in parameter space in which @xmath15 .",
    "this is appropriate if there are two interesting parameters , the spectral index and the normalization ( lampton , margon , & bowyer 1976 ) .",
    "it might be argued that the index is the only interesting parameter in this situation . in that case",
    "the appropriate confidence region would be @xmath16 , so the uncertainty could be decreased by a factor @xmath17 .",
    "spectra for all the sources can be determined in the four energy bands described above . for strong sources",
    "these can be checked by dividing the 30 mev ",
    "10  gev range into ten narrow bands .",
    "empirical corrections are applied to the flux for energy less than 70 mev ( thompson et al .",
    "the main results for the combined data are found in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "there were 19 point sources which met the criteria described above .",
    "these are all presented together in the tables , abandoning the distinctions ( fichtel et al .",
    "1994a ) between identified and unidentified sources and between significant detections ( @xmath18 ) and marginal ones ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "each source has been assigned a name based on the celestial ( j2000 ) coordinates of its most likely position , for instance j0009 + 73 . in some cases",
    "the numerical portions of these names differ slightly from those which have been used to identify these sources in previous publications because of more data and the improved diffuse model .",
    "table 1 contains information about the flux , position , and identification of the sources . the photon flux for energy @xmath7 mev",
    "is presented , along with the value of  in this band .",
    "the galactic coordinates of the most likely position are given , as well as the radius of the 95% confidence error circle in arcminutes .",
    "for the identified sources , the counterpart is named and its distance from the most likely position is given .",
    "the redshifts of the counterparts are shown , if known , and the gamma ray luminosity in the range 100 mev  10 gev is calculated .",
    "the luminosity calculation assumes isotropic emission , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 km s@xmath22 mpc@xmath22 . the photon number spectral index @xmath23 is taken from table 2 .",
    "a @xmath24 correction factor of @xmath25 has been applied so the luminosities can be compared for the same emitted energy band .",
    "table 2 contains information about the spectra of the sources in broad energy bands .",
    "photon fluxes are presented for the four standard energy bands : 30100 mev , 100 - 300 mev , 300 - 1000 mev , and @xmath91000 mev . from these values",
    "a photon number spectral index is produced , assuming a spectrum of the form @xmath26 .",
    "all of the energy spectra were consistent with the simple power law model according to a @xmath14 test .",
    "there is no compelling evidence for a spectral break or cutoff .",
    "most of the spectra , however , are of such low quality that no meaningful individual limits on the shape of the spectrum can be derived . in such cases",
    "the spectral index is just a rough guide to the hardness of the spectrum .",
    "the average energy spectra in 10 narrower energy bands are displayed in figure 1 .    to search for possible variability ,",
    "the source fluxes were examined in each of the individual viewing periods .",
    "a fairly stringent criterion was used : a @xmath14 test must show less than 5% probability that the source flux is constant . on this basis",
    "only five sources showed definite evidence for variation , j0009 + 73 ( 2.6% probability of not being variable ) , j0720 + 21 ( 1.7% ) , j0744 + 54 ( 2.3% ) , j0826 + 70 ( 4.5% ) , and j1835 + 59 ( 1.9% ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the @xmath9100 mev light curves for three of these objects .",
    "the other two are not presented here because they have been discussed fully elsewhere ( j0720 + 71 identified as 0716 + 714 in von montigny et al .",
    "1995 and lin et al . 1995a ; j0744 + 54 in mukherjee et al .",
    "some other sources have been described as variable ( j1626 - 24 in hunter et al .",
    "1994 ; j0826 + 70 in michelson et al .",
    "1994 ) , but they do not pass our @xmath14 test .",
    "it is possible that all of the detected sources may be variable to some degree , but the measurements are not precise enough to detect small changes in the weaker ones .    in a few cases some sources were bright enough to be detected with @xmath8 in individual viewing periods . in these cases ,",
    "it is possible to derive spectra for the individual observations .",
    "the resulting fluxes and spectral indices are shown in table 3 .",
    "note that the five objects listed here are the same ones with significant variability .",
    "the spectra of two objects , j0721 + 71 and j1835 + 59 , show significant variation in spectral index .",
    "there is no obvious correlation between spectral index and flux .",
    "the individual spectra of j1835 + 59 , the brightest and most often observed source , are shown in figure 3 .    because of the recent report ( quinn et al .",
    "1995 ) of the detection of 0.3 tev gamma rays from the nearby bl lac object markarian 501 with a flux of @xmath27 photons @xmath28 s@xmath22 , we searched for emission in the egret energy range",
    ". none was detected , and the 95% confidence upper limit is @xmath29 photons @xmath28 s@xmath22 for e @xmath7 mev . if the spectrum spanning the two energy bands is assumed to be a single power law , then it must be flatter than @xmath30 .",
    "this list can not be considered a complete , flux - limited survey in a strict sense .",
    "the limiting flux is a function of the local diffuse emission .",
    "a source could appear on the list either by having steady emission for the whole survey period or by having a relatively brief flare .",
    "nevertheless it is possible to say that the minimum average flux detected is about @xmath31 photons @xmath28 s@xmath22 for energy @xmath7 mev .",
    "there is marginal evidence for a difference in the spectra of the identified and unidentified objects .",
    "the mean spectral index of the identified sources is @xmath32 , with a standard deviation of 0.51 ; the mean and deviation for the unidentified sources is @xmath33 and 0.39 .",
    "a student - t test shows that the hypothesis that the two sets are drawn from the same parent population can be rejected with only 83% confidence .",
    "it remains possible that the unidentified sources may not be a homogeneous class .",
    "the gamma source counterparts are blazars , that is bl lac objects or radio - loud quasars with a flat radio spectrum , high optical polarization , or rapid variability ( angel & stockman 1980 ; burbidge & hewitt 1992 ) .",
    "our confidence in these identifications is based on a statistical argument : there are not many blazars , and many of them fall in the egret error circles ( von montigny et al .",
    "1995 ) . in these objects ,",
    "the apparent gamma - ray luminosity dominates all other wavelength bands if the emission is assumed to be isotropic .",
    "this gamma - ray brightness is seen as evidence for beaming by a relativistic jet .",

    "most of the identified sources in this region have been discussed in some detail by von montigny et al .",
