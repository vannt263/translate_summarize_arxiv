    "in order to separate @xmath2dimensional linking and knotting phenomena , john milnor introduced in 1954 the notion of a _ link homotopy _ @xcite . it is a one - parameter family of maps @xmath3 during which one allows self - intersections but does not allow different components to cross .",
    "for example , any knot is link homotopically trivial but the hopf link is not .",
    "another example of a homotopically essential link in @xmath4 is given by the borromean rings which are detected by the generalized linking number @xmath5 .",
    "more generally , milnor showed that a link in @xmath4 is homotopically trivial if and only if all its @xmath6invariants ( with non - repeating indices ) vanish . another way to formulate this result",
    "is to consider a certain quotient of the fundamental group of the link complement , now known as the _ milnor group _ , which is an invariant of link homotopy ( see section  [ sec : groups ] ) .",
    "then a link is homotopically trivial if and only if its milnor group is isomorphic to the milnor group @xmath7 of the unlink ( with @xmath8 components ) . in our paper",
    "this particular group @xmath7 , the _ free _ milnor group , is used as the key ingredient to prove the following result :    [ main ] every smooth link @xmath9 is link homotopic to the unlink .",
    "the beginning of 4dimensional link homotopy was the paper @xcite by roger fenn and dale rolfsen in 1985 who construct two disjointly immersed @xmath0spheres in @xmath10 which are not link homotopically trivial .",
    "william massey and rolfsen had just introduced higher dimensional link homotopy and observed that their generalized linking number for two @xmath0spheres in @xmath10 vanishes on embedded links .",
    "they ask in @xcite whether theorem  [ main ] is true for two component links , hence this question is sometimes referred to as the _ massey  rolfsen problem_. a proof has been attempted several times but as the referee points out , this paper gives the first correct solution , as well as a generalization to arbitrary many components .",
    "in the course of our proof we have to introduce many self - intersections into the components of @xmath11 but surprisingly we can keep different components disjoint .",
    "the argument has two completely independent steps : one is to construct a link concordance to the unlink and the other is to improve the link concordance to a link homotopy .",
    "both of these steps generalize to links of @xmath8spheres in @xmath12 for all @xmath13 .",
    "the first step is bartels phd thesis @xcite , the second teichner s habilitation @xcite .",
    "these papers are long and yet unpublished whereas both steps are discussed in full detail in this short note in dimension  4 .",
    "we would still like to announce the general result , since it seems to come as a surprise how far the massey ",
    "rolfsen problem can be pushed . for readers interested in high dimensional link homotopy we should mention that the theory was developed by fenn , habegger , hilton , kaiser , kirk , koschorke , massey , nezhinsky , rolfsen and others .    for @xmath13 ,",
    "every smooth link @xmath14 is link homotopic to the unlink .",
    "the result for two @xmath0spheres in @xmath15 is also proven by very different methods in @xcite .",
    "this paper , which is currently being rewritten , actually gives a complete calculation of the group @xmath16 of link homotopy classes of link maps @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , it implies the two component case of the following conjecture .",
    "theorem  [ main ] still holds if one component of the link @xmath11 is not embedded ( but mapped into @xmath10 disjointly from the other components ) .",
    "the conjecture is supported by the fact that it holds for one and two  component links and that all known invariants vanish on links with only one non - embedded component .",
    "it is not difficult to construct three disjointly immersed @xmath0spheres in @xmath10 , one of them embedded , which are not homotopically trivial .    here is a brief outline of the proof for theorem  [ main ] .",
    "the last section ( section  [ sec : habil ] ) contains the proof that `` link concordance implies link homotopy '' for link maps in dimension  4 .",
    "the main idea ( which works for arbitrary dimensions as long as the _ codimension _ is @xmath18 ) is to develop a theory of ambient _ singular _ handles .",
    "this leads to a generalization to immersions of colin rourke s ambient handle proof @xcite of hudson s theorem that `` concordance implies isotopy '' in codimension @xmath19 .",
    "the proof given here simplifies in contrast to higher dimensions out of several reasons :    * there are no triple points , * the singular handles are given by the well known 4dimensional whitney move ( and it s reverse ) , * there is no need to use ambient handle slides ( as in @xcite ) or ambient cerf theory ( as in @xcite ) because the relevant product structures are guaranteed by simple arguments involving only @xmath20handles .    in the other sections we show that the link @xmath11 is link concordant to the unlink , ie , that it bounds disjoint immersions of @xmath2balls into @xmath21 .",
    "one observes that by possibly introducing more singularities ( finger moves ) into the @xmath2balls one may assume that the fundamental group of the complement of these @xmath2balls is the free milnor group @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , we first construct a certain @xmath22manifold with fundamental group @xmath7 which plays the role of the complement of the @xmath2balls in @xmath21 and we then fill it in with standard thickenings of immersed @xmath2balls to get back @xmath21 .",
    "the first step is to ask whether @xmath20surgery on @xmath11 bounds a @xmath22manifold over the group @xmath7 .",
    "the answer to this question is `` yes '' using the following two known algebraic facts @xcite , @xcite ( which will be explained in the next section ) :    * @xmath7 is a finitely presented nilpotent group . *",
    "the tower of nilpotent quotients of the free group @xmath23 is homologically pro - trivial .    by alexander duality and stallings theorem @xcite ,",
    "the nilpotent quotients of @xmath24 are the same as of @xmath23 which will prove the existence of the searched for @xmath22manifold .",
    "the argument finishes with some surgeries which correct the second homology such that the filling actually leads to a @xmath22manifold which is recognized to be the @xmath22ball by an application of the @xmath25dimensional h  cobordism theorem .",
    "we wish to thank mike freedman and colin rourke for interesting comments .",

    "we first collect the necessary group theoretic facts : the _ lower central series _ of a group @xmath26 is defined by @xmath27 $ ] for @xmath28 .",
    "all nilpotent quotients of a group factor through some @xmath29 , however these are not the only interesting nilpotent quotients .",

    "we will use an induction on the number @xmath8 of normal generators . if @xmath36 the relations imply that all @xmath37 commute in @xmath33 .",
    "since by assumption these elements generate @xmath26 it follows that all commutators vanish in @xmath33 .",
    "now assume the statement holds for groups with @xmath38 normal generators and let @xmath26 be normally generated by @xmath39 .",
    "define @xmath40 to be the normal closure of the element @xmath32 .",
    "since all the conjugates of this element commute , @xmath41 is abelian . moreover",
    ", the intersection @xmath42 of all @xmath41 lies obviously in the center of @xmath33 .",

    "[ finitely_presented ] @xmath33 is generated by @xmath49 and is also finitely presented .",
    "the statement for the generators follows from the standard _ rewriting process _ in nilpotent groups : if a nilpotent group @xmath50 is normally generated by @xmath51 then it is also generated by these elements .",
    "one uses an induction on the nilpotency class of @xmath50 based on the fact that @xmath52 mod @xmath53 implies @xmath54 mod @xmath55 for all @xmath56 .",

    "an induction on the nilpotency class together with the fact that a ( central ) extension of finitely presented groups is finitely presented implies that a finitely generated nilpotent group is also finitely presented .",

    "more precisely , if one tries to ambiently cancel two handles which do cancel abstractly , one has to push the core @xmath379 of the higher handle together with the cocore @xmath380 of the lower handle into the middle level ( this uses the gradient - like vector field ) .",

    "[ four ] @xmath379 and @xmath380 are @xmath0disks and the new self - intersections are circles of double points . hence in addition to removing a single pair of critical points of types @xmath373 and @xmath374 the procedure introduces one local pair of critical points of type @xmath304 and @xmath305 for each point in @xmath382 .",
    "this together with remark  [ one ] explains how the proof of theorem  [ main ] could be given completely in the category of generic immersions .    in the argument of @xcite",
