    "ngc4388 is an active galaxy situated near the core of the virgo cluster .",
    "the spiral stellar disk ( sb(s)b pec ; phillips & malin 1982 ) is viewed nearly edge - on ( inclination @xmath6 ) with a dust lane across near the nucleus .",
    "the distance of the galaxy is assumed to be 19.7 mpc ( sandage & tammann 1984 ) throughout this paper , giving an angular scale of 95.5 pc arcsec@xmath7 .",
    "the blue and far infrared luminosities are @xmath8  and @xmath9 , assuming this distance ( david , jones & forman 1992 ) .",
    "optical spectra of the nucleus show emission lines characteristic of a seyfert type 2 galaxy ( phillips & malin 1982 ; phillips , charles & baldwin 1983 ) .",
    "an anisotropic ionization field is indicated by the cones of highly - ionized line emission extending above and below the stellar disk ( colina et al 1987 ; pogge 1988 ) .",
    "gas emitting [ oiii]@xmath10 extends as far as 50 arcsec ( @xmath115kpc ) from the nucleus ( pogge 1988 ) .",
    "the ionization state of the gas is best described as due to photoionization by a powerful nonthermal source ( pogge 1988 ; colina 1992 ) .",
    "collimation of the nuclear radiation is strongly supported by the vla images ( stone , wilson & ward 1988 ; hummel & saikia 1991 ) .",
    "the detection of a weak broad wing to h@xmath12 ( fwzi @xmath13 ) reported by filippenko & sargent ( 1985 ) suggests the presence of a seyfert 1 nucleus obscured from our direct view .",
    "shields & filippenko ( 1988 , 1996 ) also find off - nuclear broad h@xmath12 emission ( fwzi @xmath144000 ) arising within the biconical high - ionization regions observed by pogge ( 1988 ) .",
    "a plausible origin for these properties is the scattering of line emission from a hidden broad line region .",
    "a strong hard x - ray source in ngc4388 has been detected by the birmingham x - ray coded mask telescope ( sl2  xrt : hanson et al 1990 ) , the _ ginga _ lac ( takano & koyama 1991 ) and sigma ( lebrun et al 1992 ) , supporting the hypothesis of a powerful hidden nucleus .",
    "the results suggest the presence of a power - law x - ray source of photon index , @xmath15 , absorbed by a column density @xmath11 a few times @xmath16 . the absorption - corrected , 210 kev luminosity = @xmath2 , is typical for a low luminosity seyfert 1 galaxy .",
    "the origin of weak soft x - ray emission seen from the source is , on the other hand , controversial the soft x - ray luminosity , @xmath17 , first detected by the _ einstein observatory _ ( forman et al 1979 ) , is @xmath111 per cent of the absorption - corrected luminosity of the hard x - ray source and consistent with the possibility that the soft x - rays are scattered nuclear radiation .",
    "however , the _ rosat _ hri image of ngc4388 shows the 0.12.4 kev emission to be clearly extended with a radius of 45 arcsec and luminosity @xmath18(matt et al 1994 ; see also fig .",
    "the radial profile shows that half of the soft x - ray emission originate beyond the central 15 arcsec .",
    "matt et al ( 1994 ) claim that the large extent is evidence against a scattering origin for the soft x - ray emission , since the x - ray luminosity of the central source implied by the hard x - ray observations is insufficient to photoionize the necessary column density .",
    "they propose as alternative explanations either thermal emission from a starburst or a collection of discrete sources .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "pspc spectrum shows a steep spectral slope , @xmath1923 ( rush & malkan 1996 ) which may be consistent with this interpretation",
    ". however , the spectral resolution of these instruments does not provide any conclusive evidence .",
    "we report here the first _",
    "asca _ results on ngc4388 ( see tanaka , inoue & holt 1994 for a brief discussion of the capabilities of _ asca _ ) .",
    "the superior spectral resolution of _ asca _ over the 0.510 kev band enables us to identify several different components in the spectrum .",
    "ngc4388 was observed in two different pointings at adjacent elliptical galaxies in the virgo cluster , m86 ( ngc4406 ; _ asca _ results of this galaxy appear in awaki et al 1994 and matsushita et al 1994 ) and m84 ( ngc4374 ) during the _ asca _ performance verification ( pv ) phase .",
    "these observations were carried out in series between 1993 july 3 and 4 , each with an effective exposure time of about 20 ks .",
    "ngc4388 was off axis by 18 and 10 arcmin , respectively .",
    "in the first observation , ngc4388 was outside the field of view of the solid state imaging spectrometer ( sis ) detector so no sis data was obtained .",
    "data reduction was made using the _ asca _ standard softwares , xselect and ftools .",
    "one dataset of effective exposure time 17 ks for both sis ( s0 and s1 ) , and two datasets of each 20 ks were obtained for both gas imaging spectrometers ( gis : g2 and g3 ) .      the full band ( 0.710 kev ) gis image from the first observation is shown in fig .",
    "the two elliptical galaxies , m86 and m84 are present in the field of view as well as ngc4388 .",
    "distortion of the x - ray image of ngc4388 is due to the off - axis response of the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) and is consistent with the point spread function at that position ( the elongation of the image aligning with the galaxy major axis is a coincidence ) .",
    "the sis image obtained at a small off - axis position does not show evidence for significant extended emission within the spatial resolution of asca .",
    "3 indicates that ngc4388 is the only strong source in the energy band above 3 kev but is faint in the softer band .",
    "significant x - ray emission at the position of ngc4388 is , however , detected both in the gis and sis in the energy band below 3 kev as an excess above the diffuse emission spreading out from the m86 direction .",
    "energy spectra were extracted from an elliptical - shaped region with the major axis aligned with the elongation of the image ( 3 @xmath20 1.6 arcmin for the sis ; 5 @xmath213 arcmin for the gis ) .",
    "background subtraction must be done carefully , both because of the weakness of ngc4388 itself and the complex underlying diffuse emission in this busy field .",
    "since ngc4388 lies close to the core of the virgo cluster there is significant emission from the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "the temperature of the icm , @xmath22 kev , has been measured with _ ginga _",
    "( koyama , takano & tawara 1991 ) and _ rosat _ ( bhringer et al 1994 ) .",
    "in addition , there may be some extended emission from m86 kev and abundance @xmath23for the total x - ray emission of m86 after fitting with a raymond - smith thermal spectrum model . ] which makes the background around ngc4388 complicated .",
    "we have checked the background data by dividing it into four distinct regions .",
    "the data taken from the far side ( sw of ngc4388 ) of m86 and m84 are weaker than in the other directions and show a different spectral shape .",
    "this implies that the diffuse emission has a gradient in intensity and spectrum across the source - extracted region of ngc4388 .",
    "we thus took background data from a circular , annulus of width 5 arcmin for the sis and a circular or an elliptical annulus ( depending on off - axis angle ) with a radius of 68 arcmin for the gis .",
    "the background used here should be a good approximation of the true background , since taking data from the region surrounding the source should smear the gradient out .",
    "the background - subtracted count rate in each detector is shown in table 1 .",
    "the source fraction of the total counts in the source - extraction region for each detector is about 70 per cent for the sis data , 60 per cent for the first gis data , and 68 per cent for the second gis data .",
    "we find no obvious change in observed flux during each observation .",
    "any possible flux change is less than @xmath24 per cent during each @xmath25 ks long observation ( net exposure time is @xmath1120 ks in each ) .",
    "differences of count rate between the two gis observations ( table 1 ) are owing to differences of effective area of the photon collecting region at the given off - axis positions .",
    "the effective area obtained through the xrt and gis responses in the first observation is @xmath26 per cent of that in the second observation .",
    "this means that there is no significant change in source flux between the two observations after the correction .",
    ".the background - subtracted count rate in each detector .",
    "there is no sis data in the first observation .",
    "ngc4388 is observed at off - axis angle @xmath27 arcmin in the first observation , and @xmath28 arcmin in the second observation .",
    "the effective area of the source - photon collected region of ngc4388 in the first observation is @xmath26 per cent of that in the second observation . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we detected strong absorption @xmath29  for the hard x - ray component , with a relatively small uncertainty compared with previous measurement ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the constraint on the photon index is weak owing to the limited energy range and strong absorption .",
    "the best - fit @xmath30 is consistent with previous results ( hanson et al 1990 ; takano & koyama 1991 ) .",
    "a strong fluorescence iron k@xmath12 line is found for the first time in this object .",
    "the equivalent width ( ew ) is quite large despite the relatively narrow line width .",
    "there is no evidence for the line broadening in the gis data whereas there is weak evidence ( @xmath31 kev ) in the sis data .",
    "when we assume that the pl@xmath32 has an identical @xmath33 to the pl@xmath34 , some extra absorption , @xmath35 ,  is required ( see table 2 ) .",
    "this means that the soft x - ray spectrum around 2 kev is extremely flat .",
    "the observed fluxes are summarized in table 3 .",
    "the flux in the 310 kev band is slightly smaller than that observed by the sl2  xrt ( @xmath36 ; hanson et al 1990 ) .",
    "the soft x - ray flux is roughly consistent with previous measurements from the _ rosat _ pspc ( @xmath37 , rush & malkan 1996 ) and the _ rosat _ hri ( @xmath38 , matt et al 1994 ) , extrapolating our best - fit model down to 0.1 kev , although the _ rosat _ flux depends on the assumed model .",

    "we find clear evidence for strong obscuration along the line of sight .",
    "the column density @xmath29  implied from the _ asca _ spectrum is similar to those observed in some other classical seyfert 2 galaxies ( e.g. , awaki et al 1991 ; iwasawa et al 1994 ) . the photon index ( @xmath30 )",
    "is also consistent with that of seyfert galaxies .",
    "our best - fit value can be justified by the fact that a _ sigma _ observation in the 40150 kev band ( lebrun et al 1992 ) is in agreement with an extrapolation of the result of hanson et al ( 1990 ) , unless any extra component , e.g. compton reflection component , has a significant contribution at the hard x - ray band ( the reflection contribution should be small if the inner disk is highly inclined to our line of sight ) .",
    "the absorption - corrected 210 kev flux of the hard power - law component is @xmath40 , corresponding to a luminosity , @xmath41 .",
    "this is within the range of seyfert 1 nuclei .",
    "colina ( 1992 ) predicted that a uv luminosity , @xmath42 , is required to explain the high ionization extended nebula .",
    "if ngc4388 has the ratio , @xmath43 , generally appropriate for active galaxies , then the intrinsic x - ray luminosity of the central source is reasonable .",
    "this agreement may imply that the radiation of the central continuum is not significantly anisotropic , because the x - ray measurement is for line - of - sight radiation while the calculation of the uv luminosity is made for the ionized nebulae extending perpendicular to the line - of - sight .",
    "the implied heavy obscuration is opaque to the optical / uv continuum from the central source , unless the dust to gas ratio is unusually low . even in the near - infrared band , hei@xmath44",
    "m and pa@xmath45 m do not show any broad component ( ruiz , rieke & schmidt 1994 ) .",
    "the displacement between the optical nucleus and the radio/10@xmath46 m peak ( stone et al 1988 ) is likely due to this obscuration effect , and the true nucleus should be at the radio/10@xmath46 m nucleus position .",
    "even though deficits of hi and co gas in this galaxy have been reported ( chamaraux , balkowski , & gerard 1980 ; kenney & young 1986 ) , plenty of cold gas remains close to the central x - ray source .",
    "this can form an obscuring torus such as proposed in the unification scheme of seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "the anisotropic radio source extending perpendicular to the galaxy ( stone et al 1988 ; hummel & saikia 1991 ) and the conical high - ionization regions observed in the optical band ( pogge 1988 ; colina et al 1987 ) are compatible with the idea of collimation of radiation by the torus .",
    "we note that the symmetrical axes of the torus and the stellar disk of ngc4388 are aligned as well as ngc4945 ( iwasawa et al 1993 ) , while they are misaligned in most cases ( e.g. , ngc1068 , antonucci & miller 1985 ; ngc5252 , tadhunter & tsvetanov 1989 ) .",
    "an alternative source of the strong x - ray absorption is the interstellar medium in the nearly edge - on galaxy disk itself .",
    "recent near - infrared imaging has revealed that this galaxy has a boxy bulge ( mcleod & rieke 1995 ) .",
    "this and the dust lane crossing in front of the nucleus can be responsible for some or all of the absorption . in this case , the flat spectrum between 1 and 3 kev is possibly explained by transmission of scattered radiation from the central source seen through the stellar disk . since the disk is tilted by @xmath11 18 degrees from being exactly edge - on , there may be less absorption along these lines of sight , so making a flat spectrum in the softer band in addition to the strongly absorbed component .",
    "we note there will be some scattering in the obscuring medium with @xmath47  leading to a hard power - law component in the 13 kev band ( yaqoob 1996 ) .",
    "this , however , is at least an order of magnitude fainter than the observed power - law in that band , unless the absorbing medium is partially ionized .",
    "a strong iron k@xmath12 emission line is detected at 6.4 kev .",
    "the large equivalent width ( @xmath48  ev ) of the 6.4  kev line is one of the signatures of reprocessing in cold matter .",
    "various calculations of x - ray spectra emerging from a central power - law source surrounded by a torus do predict a large ew ( awaki et al 1991 ; krolik , madau & ycki 1994 ; ghisellini , haardt & matt 1994 ) .",
    "however , the observed ew is larger than the value ( @xmath49  300  ev ) expected from the work of awaki et al ( 1991 ) with @xmath47 , taking an opening angle of the torus of about 1/3 , as deduced from the optical extended nebula ( pogge 1988 ) .",
    "the excess ew could be due to an enhanced iron abundance .",
    "although the present data can not provide any meaningful restriction on the depth of any iron k absorption edge at 7.1 kev , and hence on the iron abundance , a deep edge due to a supersolar abundance of iron could partly explain the flat hard x - ray spectra , found in some _ ginga _ seyfert 2 spectra ( awaki et al 1991 ; smith & done 1996 ) , especially when the column density exceeds @xmath50 .",
    "a similar iron k line feature has been found in _",
    "spectra of another seyfert 2 galaxy mrk  3 ( iwasawa et al 1994 ) .",
    "mrk  3 showed a significant intensity change of the iron k line in response to the continuum variation between two observations of 3.6 yr apart .",
    "this fact suggests that the line is produced within @xmath111 pc from the central source .",
    "we do not of course detect any variability within the present one - day observing run of ngc4388 and therefore can not obtain any constraint about the line emitting region from this observation .",
    "there is a flat spectral component detected in the intermediate energy range between the hard component and the thermal component .",
    "such a flat component has been observed in _ asca _ spectra of seyfert 2 galaxies ngc1068 ( ueno et al 1994 ) and ngc6552 ( fukazawa et al 1994 ) , and the eclipse spectrum of x - ray binary vela x-1 ( nagase et al 1994 ) .",
    "these are considered to be scattered continuum of the central source .",
    "it is therefore plausible that this component in ngc4388 is also scattered radiation from the central obscured source , although the possibility that it is radiation from the central source escaping through a partially covering absorber as mentioned in section 3.1.2 .",
    "is also viable .    as the broad h@xmath12 detected from the off - nuclear region ( shields & filippenko 1988 ; 1996 ) suggests , scattered light",
    "may be observed in the optical band .",
    "however , spectropolarimetry in the optical blue band does not detect any such broad - line region ( kay 1994 ) .",
    "one can expect that several emission lines produced in the photoionized gas or cold gas which is responsible for the scattering whould be observable on the x - ray continuum , as seen in the _ asca _ spectra of mrk  3 ( iwasawa et al 1994 ) and ngc6552 ( fukazawa et al 1994 ; reynolds et al 1994 ) .",
    "it is , however , hard to detect such lines in our data , because of poorer statistics and contamination by the thermal emission .",
    "the detected absorption column density of a few times @xmath51  imposed on the power - law is consistent with the narrow - line region reddening e(b ",
    "v)@xmath52 mag deduced from the [ sii ] doublet ( malkan 1983 ) , although a recent estimate of the reddening from pa@xmath53/h@xmath54 gives a greater value , e(b ",
    "v)@xmath55 mag than this ( ruiz et al 1994 ) .",
    "we do however detect a marginally significant iron line due to hydrogenic iron in the sis spectrum at @xmath56  kev of equivalent width @xmath57  ev against the absorbed hard continuum or @xmath58  kev against an extrapolation of the scatttered continuum .",
    "the strength of this line is difficult to predict as it is probably due to resonant scattering of the continuum ( matt , brandt & fabian 1996 ) , but it does corroborate the scattering hypothesis . to be so highly ionized , the scattering medium is probably within a pc of the nucleus for the observed x - ray luminosity of the central source .",
    "we note that a reasonable fit to the whole sis spectrum can be obtained with a partially - covered power - law spectrum , with a gaussian line at 6.4  kev and an edge at 0.9  kev .",
    "this last feature could be due to a oxygen warm absorber , such as is commonly observed in the spectra of seyfert 1 galaxies , along the line of sight to the scattering medium .",
    "this model is rejected because the _ rosat _ hri image shows that the scattering medium is much more extended than can be plausibly ionized by the central source ( matt et al 1994 ) .",
    "other explanations for the flat spectrum are transmission through the edge - on stellar disk , as discussed in the previous section , and a population of high mass x - ray binaries .",
    "this last possibility is unlikely given the expected massive star population in the galaxy .",
    "the ratio of far infrared luminosity to blue luminosity can be an indicator of relative excess of young population ( o stars and high mass x - ray binaries ; david et al 1992 ) .",
    "since this ratio in ngc4388 , @xmath59 , is a factor of 10 lower than in m82 , it is unlikely that an intensive starburst like that in m82 is taking place in ngc4388 . a collection of x - ray binaries is expected to emit a much smaller x - ray luminosity than that observed ( @xmath60 ) .      the _ asca _ spectrum , combined with the extended image ( fig .",
    "1 ) resolved by the _ rosat _",
    "hri ( matt et al 1994 ) , provides evidence that the soft x - ray emission below 1kev is of thermal origin . such thermal emission has been observed in the _ asca _ spectra of other nearby spiral galaxies which contain an obscured seyfert nucleus ( e.g. , ngc1068 , ueno et al 1994 ; ngc4258 , makishima et al 1994 ) .",
    "the temperature is @xmath61 kev and the abundance is extremely low ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the 0.53 kev luminosity of this thermal emission is = @xmath63 , consistent with the _ einstein _ ipc measurement ( forman et al 1979 ) .",
    "our spectral fits shows most of the observed x - rays below 1.5 kev come from the thermal component ( see fig . 4 and fig . 5 ) .",
    "this is compatible with the fact that most of the x - ray emission detected by the _",
    "hri is extended over the nucleus ( matt et al 1994 ) , taking account for the _ rosat _ bandpass .",
    "the extended thermal gas could be the stripped interstellar medium of the galaxy .",
    "starburst activity is not strong in ngc4388 , as discussed in section 4.3 , but consistent with that in normal galaxies with respect to the @xmath64 correlation ( david et al 1992 ) .",
    "ngc4388 is known to be located close to the virgo cluster core , and to move at high velocity of 1311  relative to the cluster ( corbin et al 1988 ) in the deep cluster potential the deficiency of hi and co in this galaxy has been explained in terms of ram - pressure stripping by interaction with the virgo icm ( chamaraux et al 1980 ; giovanelli & haynes 1983 ; kenney & young 1986 ) .",
    "this stripping mechanism may also explain the x - ray plume of the nearby elliptical galaxy m86 ( forman et al 1979 ; white et al 1991 ; rangarajan et al 1995 ) which also has similar high radial velocity relative to the cluster ( they may be part of an infalling group ) .",
    "the lower temperature and lower abundance in ngc4388 are different from the x - ray plume of m86 , however .",
    "high quality soft x - ray imaging , such as will be available with _ axaf _ , are needed to settle this issue .",
    "finally , we note that at the radius of the thermal component ( 1.44.5  kpc , matt et al 1994 ) the gas density is only @xmath65  @xmath66 , assuming bremsstrahlung emission since the abundance is so low , and any scattered x - ray emission will be negligible .",
    "the bremsstrahlung emission from any scattering medium at a temperature @xmath67 k would swamp the scattered flux .",
    "the radiative cooling time of the gas is @xmath68  yr and the recombination time ( of say highly ionized oxygen ) is @xmath69  yr . the flow time at a velocity of @xmath70  is @xmath71  yr . the gas may therefore be due to an outburst in the last ten million yr , or a more general wind from the nuclear regions .",
    "the mass flow rate is then about _",
    "m_@xmath72yr@xmath7 where @xmath73 is a wind velocity in unit of 300  and @xmath74 is the radius of the thermal emission region in units of 2 kpc , which is at the highest end of the values for superwind galaxies ( _ m_@xmath111100yr@xmath7 , heckman , armus & miley 1991 ) .",
    "this large mass injection is unlikely for ngc4388 since it shows no evidence for a strong starburst such as in superwind galaxies .",
    "the low measured abundance ( though error is rather large ) is also puzzling .",
    "it is however measured mainly for iron - l in our spectrum .",
    "as the abundance of iron is usually lower than that of other elements in starburst galaxies , the low abundance may not be unusual if the thermal emission is produced through a recent starburst .",
    "we have identified several problems in the interpretation of the x - ray data of ngc4388 : a ) the large soft x - ray extent , if thermal , means a large mass loss rate from the bulge which can only plausibly last a few million yr , b ) a thermal model requires a very low abundance in the extended gas and c ) the iron line is high for the observed obscuration ( and in the case of an iron line from reflection assuming that the solid angle subtended by this and thicker gas at the nucleus is from a toroidal geometry aligned with the disk of the galaxy ) .",
    "these unusual propoerties can be solved if we assume that the nucleus has not always had its present luminosity , @xmath75 , but had a higher luminosity , @xmath76 a thousand years or more ago when gas at the radius of the soft x - ray extent ( @xmath77  kpc ) was being irradiated .",
    "the warm absorber solution in section 4.3 requires that the ionization parameter , @xmath78 where the density of gas at radius @xmath79 is @xmath80 , is @xmath81 .",
    "then @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the fraction of the volume within @xmath79 being irradiated and @xmath84 is the thomson cross - section .",
    "we then find @xmath85 , the thomson depth of the region is then @xmath86 and the density @xmath87 .",
    "provided that @xmath83 is not small the luminosity is plausible for a central engine of more than @xmath88 .",
    "it is possible that the optical line emission only shows up one side of a very wide cone so @xmath89 .    with this solution",
    ", all of the x - ray emission below 3  kev can be due to scattering by partially - ionized gas within a few kpc of the nucleus .",
    "the feature in the spectrum around 1  kev is then due to absorption by oviii .",
    "the oviii absorption edge would be produced in a region close to the nucleus as found in mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( otani et al 1996 ) .",
    "the presence of dust in the ionized gas implied from the optical / near infrared extinction is not peculiar but similar to the dusty warm absorber observed in iras13349 + 2438 ( brandt , fabian & pounds 1996 ) as well as mcg6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "the nucleus must have been 100 or more times more luminous in the past .",
    "enhanced iron k - line emission could be produced by gas in the bulge and disk of the galaxy ( see fabian 1977 ) .",
    "a continuous decrease in x - ray luminosity over a long time scale has been observed in some seyfert galaxies such as ngc  2992 ( weaver et al 1996 ) , mrk  3 ( iwasawa et al 1994 ) and ngc  1275 ( a. edge , private communication ) .",
    "the seyfert 1.9 galaxy ngc2992 , for example , has declined in luminosity by more than a factor of 20 over the last 17 yr . the luminosity variation is similar to that found for those seyfert galaxies , except that in ngc4388 we require a larger variation over a longer timescale .",
    "as discussed for mrk  3 ( iwasawa et al 1994 ) and ngc  2992 ( weaver et al 1996 ) , a reverberation effect makes the ew of the iron k line large if the x - ray luminosity decreases continuously .",
    "the main problem is the lack of observed optical polarization",
    ". this could however be low due to the small extraction window used by kay ( 1994 ) , which mainly sampled the region obscured by the galaxy disk , and to a wide opening angle for the emerging radiation , which reduces the predicted level of polarization .",
    "further spectropolarimetric observations of a wider region are required .",
    "we find from the _ asca _ observations that the spectrum of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc4388 has many components",
    ". the hard x - ray emission is strongly absorbed , and a strong iron k line ( @xmath90 440730 ev ) is found at 6.4 kev .",
    "the hard continuum has a photon index @xmath30 and is absorbed by a column density @xmath29 .",
    "evidence for a thermal spectrum is found in the soft x - ray band , which can be identified with the spatially extended emission observed by _",
