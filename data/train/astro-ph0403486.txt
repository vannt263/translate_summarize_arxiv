    "low mass stars with late spectral types ( m , l ) are the majority constituent of the galaxy by number .",
    "their main - sequence lifetimes are much greater than the current age of the universe and they therefore serve as useful probes of galactic star formation history in the local solar neighborhood ( gizis , reid & hawley 2002 ) .",
    "they also encompass many important regions of stellar parameter space , including the onset of complete convection in the stellar interior , the onset of significant electron degeneracy in the core , and the formation of dust and subsequent depletion of metals onto dust grains in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "of particular interest is the fact that many late - type stars have strong surface magnetic fields ( johns - krull & valenti 1996 ) that heat the outer atmosphere above the photosphere , and lead to observable emission from the chromosphere ( e.g. ca ii and h balmer series lines ) , the transition region ( e.g resonance lines of abundant ions such as c iv ) , and the corona ( e.g. thermal soft x - rays ) . the physics that controls",
    "the production of magnetic fields in low mass stars is not well understood , as the lack of a radiative - convective boundary layer precludes storing large scale fields as in a solar - type dynamo .",
    "however , recent work on turbulent dynamo mechanisms ( bercik et al . 2004 ) may soon provide new insight into the formation and properties of magnetic fields in low mass stars .",
    "the present study seeks to place strong empirical constraints on the magnetic activity in these stars , by measuring optical h@xmath0 emission in a sample of nearly 8000 low mass dwarfs .",
    "our results will aid in the interpretation of the models and provide a connection to the physical processes occurring in the atmospheres of the stars .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission line is produced by collisional excitation in the relatively dense chromospheres of these low mass , high gravity stars .",
    "located in the red region of the optical spectrum , it is the strongest and best - studied indicator of magnetic activity in late type stars ( in contrast to solar type stars which are usually studied in the ca ii h and k resonance lines ) .",
    "previous results indicate that the fraction of m dwarfs with h@xmath0 emission increases from early to mid m spectral types ( joy & abt 1974 ; hawley , gizis & reid 1996 ) , reaches a peak near type m7 where essentially all stars are active , and declines toward later types ( gizis et al .",
    "the increasing fraction in the early to mid m types may be an age effect such that the activity lasts longer in the mid m types ( hawley , reid & tourtellot 2000a ; gizis et al .",
    "2002 ) , while the decline toward late m types may reflect difficulty in producing and/or maintaining surface magnetic fields due to the physics of turbulent dynamos and/or the increasingly neutral atmosphere ( hawley , reid & gizis 2000b ; fleming , giampapa & schmitt 2000 ; mohanty et al . 2002 ) .",
    "it does not appear that the atmosphere changes character such that h@xmath0 is no longer produced when magnetic activity is present in the later type stars .",
    "indeed the ratio of h@xmath0 to transition region ( c iv ) and soft x - ray emission appears to be similar throughout the m dwarf spectral sequence ( hawley & johns - krull 2003 ) .",
    "previous work also shows that the activity strength , measured by the ratio of the luminosity in h@xmath0 to the bolometric luminosity ( l@xmath4/l@xmath5 ) , is nearly constant ( with large scatter ) through the m0-m6 range ( hawley et al . 1996 ) and declines at later types ( burgasser et al .",
    "2002 , cruz & reid 2002 ) . however , the sample of stars on which these conclusions are based numbers less than 100 for types m7 and later , due to the difficulty of obtaining spectra for these faint objects .",
    "our sample in this crucial spectral type range is an order of magnitude larger , comprising more than 1000 stars with types between m7 and l0 , and nearly 8000 stars between m0 and l0 .",
    "this uniformly acquired and reduced sample from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , with well - characterized uncertainties , now allows us to obtain statistically significant magnetic activity results for the entire m dwarf spectral type range .",
    "in addition , we compare the photometric colors of the active and inactive stars to investigate whether the active stars are typically bluer at the same spectral type , an effect attributed to an increase in plage areas on active stars by amado & byrne ( 1997 ) .",
    "alternatively , such a correlation might indicate that micro - flaring activity plays a significant role in heating the outer atmospheres of active m dwarfs ( cf .",
    "gdel et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "our sdss spectral sample is also well - suited for investigation of the incidence of low mass subdwarfs in the local neighborhood . gizis ( 1997 ) showed that m subdwarfs could be identified by comparing the metallicity and gravity sensitive molecular bands of cah and tio . using his technique ,",
    "we identify dozens of new m subdwarf and extreme subdwarf candidates , and examine their colors in the sdss @xmath6 filters .",
    "the sdss ( york et al . 2000 ; gunn et al . 1998 ; fukugita et al . 1996 ; hogg et al .",
    "2001 ; smith et al . 2002",
    "; stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ; pier et al .",
    "2003 , abazajian et al . 2003 ) is an excellent tool for spectroscopic studies of stars .",
    "each spectroscopic plate produces 640 spectra with resolution @xmath7 . because all spectra are obtained and reduced through uniform pipelines with well understood uncertainties ( york et al .",
    "2000 ) , it is possible to undertake statistically robust studies of very large samples .",
    "our sample was selected from the sdss spectroscopic and photometric databases as follows . in july 2002 ,",
    "the spectroscopic database was queried for all objects which satisfied the sdss color cuts for late - type stars given in hawley et al .",
    "( 2002 ; hereafter h02 ) , viz . @xmath8 and @xmath9 . the photometry for the color cuts came from the preliminary sdss photometric database available at that time .",
    "this color cut yielded @xmath10 late - type star candidates with sdss spectra . in april 2003",
    "we added an additional @xmath11 candidates from spectroscopic observations that were specifically targeted for late type stars in the southern survey region .",
    "the final @xmath12 candidates come from 427 sdss spectroscopic plates ; 380 of the plates are in the sdss data release 2 ( dr2 ; abazajian et al .",
    "2004 ) sky area while 47 plates have yet to be publicly released . due to recent improvements in the photometric reductions ,",
    "we have used photometry only from the 5_4_25 version of photo ( sdss photometric reduction software ) in our final analysis .",
    "this is the same version used in the dr2 release .",
    "in order to assign spectral types to the stars in the sample , we pass each spectrum through two independent spectral typing pipelines .",
    "the first method determines the best fit , in a least squares sense , to both the sdss late - type template spectra defined in h02 and the template spectra from the keck and apache point observatories used by h02 in their analysis ; it is a derivative of the procedure originally described in kirkpatrick ( 1991 ) and subsequently modified by henry et al .",
    "the second method measures several molecular band indices in each spectrum and uses a weighted mean of the individual types from each index to assign a best - guess spectral type ( cf .",
    "reid , hawley , & gizis 1995a ; kirkpatrick et al .",
    "both methods are described in detail in h02 . using the spectral typing pipeline outputs as a guide , each spectrum",
    "is individually inspected by eye and the assigned spectral type is altered as needed . as reported in h02 ,",
    "the uncertainty in this procedure is @xmath13 1 spectral type .",
    "spectra with a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xmath14 5 are not typed , as experience shows that they do not give useful results in our analysis . of the 22000 original candidates",
    ", @xmath15 were assigned m or l spectral types and had spectra with the necessary signal - to - noise ratio for further analysis .",
    "an important byproduct of the spectral typing procedure was the identification of numerous white dwarf - m dwarf binary systems in our sample .",
    "we find the binaries based on the appearance of blue continuum flux and features such as broad hydrogen balmer absorption lines ( raymond et al .",
    "we have removed all such binaries from the final sample so that their colors will not affect our investigation of the colors of active vs. inactive m dwarfs , and because the nature of the m dwarf activity may be influenced by the presence of a close binary companion .",
    "@xmath163.3 outlines a photometric test used to further constrain our sample to stars without white dwarf companions .",
    "our sample is thus , as far as possible , composed of only single m dwarfs ( or m dwarfs in binary systems with fainter m or l dwarfs that we are unable to discern from the spectra ) .",
    "the sdss spectra are spectrophotometrically calibrated , so we measure the h@xmath0 flux directly from each spectrum .",
    "the challenge is to automatically , but accurately , measure the flux in h@xmath0 over a range of spectral types with changing continuum slope and molecular features .",
    "our procedure uses trapezoidal integration to sum the flux under the emission line , taking care to avoid and/or account for regions that are affected by local tio features including the continuum bump just to the blue of h@xmath0 ( pettersen & coleman 1981 ) and the absorption trough to the red ( tinney & reid 1998 ; white & basri 2003 ) .",
    "we define a 14  interval ( 7  on either side of the line center ) for the h@xmath0 flux calculation .",
    "we investigated several options to find the optimum continuum flux measure : a ) the average over two 50   sections ( 6500 - 6550  and 6575 - 6625 ) on either side of the line ; b ) the average over two 10  sections ( 6545 - 6555  and 6575 - 6585 ) on either side of the line ; and c ) the blue 10  region only , as used by reid et al.(1995a ) for the pmsu survey ( 6545 - 6555 ) .",
    "we found no significant differences in the mean continuum values for these three measures , and therefore chose to use measure ( a ) as it is the most robust , and because we also use the 50  regions as comparison for the equivalent width ( ew ) measurement ( see below ) .",
    "the formal uncertainty in the flux at each wavelength is available from the sdss spectral calibration and is propagated at every stage of the analysis .    in order to be defined as active , each spectrum must pass the following criteria : 1 ) the h@xmath0 ew must be greater than 1.0 ; 2 ) the uncertainty in the ew must be smaller than the ew value ; 3 ) the height of the h@xmath0 emission line must be 3 times the noise at line center ; and 4 ) the ew of h@xmath0 must be 3 times larger than the average ew of the 50  comparison regions .",
    "we examined subsets of the spectra that pass less conservative criteria , including those that passed only 2 or 3 of the 4 tests . these account for less than 5% of the total sample , and upon inspection are clearly marginal .",
    "there are 430 stars in the less conservative subsets that appear to be active but have h@xmath0 ew less than 1.0 .",
    "we do not include these in our analysis but mention them as potential active stars similar to the stars in groups c and e of gizis et al .",
    "for the remainder of this paper all results reported will be from spectra that either passed all of the above criteria ( active - 1910 stars ) or failed all of our tests , including the tests with less stringent criteria ( inactive - 5930 stars ) , for a total of 7840 stars in the final activity sample .",
    "subdwarfs have also been removed from this sample ; they are discussed separately in @xmath164.4 below .",
    "we reiterate that in order to be classified as inactive , the h@xmath0 ew must be less than 1.0 . thus a star with h@xmath0",
    "ew @xmath18 1.0 , but with noisy data , is not classified as either active or inactive , but is simply removed from the sample . the h02 subset of 659 late type stars from the sdss early data release was analyzed with this method and then inspected by eye .",
    "we found that less than 4% of the stars were incorrectly labeled as active or inactive , and cite this as a measure of our ability to determine the activity status automatically .",
    "a star s magnetic activity can be qualitatively assessed as either active or inactive using the ew of the h@xmath0 emission line .",
    "however , because the ew measure depends on the flux in the local stellar continuum , it can not be used to compare the strength of the activity in stars of different spectral type ( reid , hawley , & mateo 1995b ) .",
    "instead , we measure activity strength by computing the ratio of the luminosity in h@xmath0 ( l@xmath4 ) to the bolometric luminosity ( l@xmath5 ) .",
    "the ratio l@xmath4/l@xmath5 is a measure of the magnetically driven radiative output compared to the total radiative output of the star , and does not depend on the shape of the stellar continuum .    in the past",
    ", l@xmath19 has been calculated by converting the measured h@xmath0 flux to a luminosity using the distance to the star",
    ". however , distance determinations for the stars in our sample rest on either spectroscopic or photometric parallax methods . to avoid introducing additional uncertainty into our l@xmath19 calculation due to uncertainties in the distances",
    ", we use a distance - independent method of calculating l@xmath19/l@xmath5 .",
    "the method is described in detail in walkowicz et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and uses well - observed nearby m and l dwarfs with known distances to empirically determine the ratio of the luminosity in the continuum at h@xmath0 , l(cont)@xmath19 , to the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the resulting ratios @xmath20 = l(cont)@xmath19/l@xmath5 are tabulated as a function of spectral type and color , and when multiplied by the ew in h@xmath0 for a given star , give the desired ratio l@xmath19/l@xmath5 .    since the @xmath20 ratios are tabulated at 0.5 spectral type intervals , and we use integer spectral types in our analysis , a weighted mean of the @xmath20 values surrounding a given integer spectral type was computed .",
    "we give the two surrounding values 1/4 the weight of the integer @xmath20 value .",
    "this weight is also used in propagating the uncertainties .",
    "we multiply each measured h@xmath0 ew by the appropriate mean @xmath20 factor and thereby calculate l@xmath19/l@xmath5 for each active star in our sample .",
    "note that because there are no m0 stars in the nearby star sample , the m0 l@xmath19/l@xmath5 values in the present work have been calculated using only the m0.5 @xmath20 value .",
    "the colors used in our analysis are formed from the @xmath6 psf magnitudes in the sdss photometric database .",
    "as described above , we use photometry only from the latest ( fall 2003 , photo v. 5_4_25 ) pipeline reductions . to assure reasonable photometric accuracy , we include only stars with @xmath21 magnitude uncertainties less than 0.3 and @xmath22 magnitude uncertainties less than 0.2 in our analysis of color effects .",
    "this decreases the number of stars available for analysis to @xmath132200 .",
    "however , if the @xmath21 band data are not required , for example when examining @xmath23 colors , the sample numbers @xmath135800 .",
    "the maximum uncertainties in the colors that we use are therefore 0.36 magnitudes in @xmath24 and 0.28 magnitudes in @xmath23 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "the great majority of stars in this color sample have uncertainties much smaller than these maximum values , with typical values being @xmath27 @xmath14 0.02 for @xmath28 ( ivezi et al . 2003 ; 11% of the sample ) ; @xmath27 @xmath14 0.03 for @xmath29 ( 46% of the sample ) ; and @xmath27 @xmath14 0.04 for @xmath30 ( 83% of the sample ) .    as discussed above , a significant source of scatter in the blue colors of the late type stars in our sample",
    "was introduced by the presence of numerous white dwarf - m dwarf binary systems .",
    "the spectroscopically - identified pairs were originally removed during the spectral typing process .",
    "in addition , we made a color cut on our sample , and included only stars whose colors lie outside the locus of known white dwarf - m dwarf pairs in the @xmath23 vs. @xmath24 color - color diagram ( silvestri , hawley & szkody 2003 ; smoli et al .",
    "2004 ) . in practice",
    "this meant that only stars with @xmath24 @xmath18 1.8 are included in the sample .",
    "all suspected pairs based on either photometry or spectroscopy were therefore removed , and are not included in the final spectroscopic sample of 7840 stars .      to investigate the presence of metal poor stars in our sample , we use the varying strengths of the tio and cah molecular bands in a low metallicity environment .",
    "we measure the tio5 , cah1 and cah2 molecular band indices following the procedure outlined by reid et al.(1995a ) .",
    "gizis ( 1997 ) uses the same indices to define divisions between dwarfs , subdwarfs and extreme subdwarfs . in our study ,",
    "the following criteria are used to restrict the sample of subdwarfs to high probability candidates : a ) the band indices must be larger than their uncertainties ( typical uncertainties are 0.04 in tio5 ; 0.03 in cah1 ; and 0.02 in cah2 ) ; b ) the band heights must be larger than both the noise in the continuum near the bandhead and the noise in the bottom of the absorption feature ; and c ) the computed uncertainties in the band indices must not overlap the subdwarf or extreme subdwarf boundaries .",
    "we find that in our sample of 7840 stars that are either active or inactive , 1910 are classified as active ( 24.4% ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : act ] shows the fraction of stars which are active as a function of spectral type .",
    "the active fraction peaks at spectral type m8 , where 73% of stars are active . the numbers above each spectral type bin represent the total number of stars ( both active and inactive ) in the bin .",
    "the peak at m8 is consistent with gizis et al .",
    "( 2000a ) , who found a peak in the relation at types m7 and m8 using similar activity criteria .",
    "however , all stars in their sample were active at these types , while our results show @xmath31 of our m7 - 8 stars are active .",
    "we have confirmed by eye that indeed many of the m7 and m8 stars in our sample do not have measurable activity .",
    "figure  [ fig : inact ] shows examples of active and inactive m7 and m8 stars .",
    "the continuum features near h@xmath0 are noticeable in the inactive stars ( blue bump , red trough ) , but it is clear that no measurable emission at h@xmath0 is present .    following a suggestion by neill reid ( private communication ) , we considered whether the disparity in active fraction at type m7 could be a distance effect .",
    "the gizis et al.(2000a ) sample was drawn from 2mass and represents mostly nearby stars , while the sdss sample described here extends to much greater distances due to the fainter limiting magnitude .",
    "we therefore restricted ourselves to just the m7 stars in the sample , and computed the distance to each star via the @xmath26 photometric parallax relation from h02 .",
    "only stars with good photometry ( @xmath32 ) were included ( see  3.3 ) , which reduced the sample from 777 to 269 .",
    "note that we did not combine stars of different spectral type ( color ) in the sample , so the relative distances between the m7 stars should be quite accurate , as uncertainties in the absolute calibration of the photometric parallax relation at different colors do not affect the calculation .",
    "we then computed the vertical distance , perpendicular to the galactic plane , for each star .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : distance ] for 60 pc distance bins .",
    "though the number of stars in each bin is relatively small , leading to significant poisson errors , there does appear to be a trend of decreasing active fraction with vertical distance from the plane in both the north ( positive ) and south ( negative ) directions . if activity is related to age , as discussed by hawley et al .",
    "( 2000a ) and gizis et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , then this effect would be a natural consequence of the increasing velocity dispersion in older disk stars : the older stars would be more likely to be found further from the plane where they were born .",
    "kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 1994 ) first discussed the possibility that younger stars were found when looking south ( toward the plane , from the sun s position 30 parsecs north of the plane ) than north , out of the plane .",
    "small sample sizes and uncertain distances precluded a definitive test using data available at that time , but we may now be seeing evidence for this effect in our much larger sample .",
    "the uncertainties are still large however , and more data are needed to verify this result .",
    "we plan to carry out a rigorous comparison between the 2mass and sdss samples to further investigate the correlation of activity fraction with distance from the plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : hist ] illustrates the activity strength , log(@xmath33 ) , as a function of spectral type .",
    "each histogram represents the distribution of log(@xmath33 ) at a given spectral type .",
    "the number to the right of the histogram is the peak value of the distribution .",
    "we see that log(@xmath33 ) peaks near -3.7 for stars of type m0-m5 , in agreement with hawley et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and systematically peaks at lower activity strength among stars with later type .",
    "the 1  h@xmath0 ew measurement limit in our sample imposes a lower limit on the measurable activity strength . at each spectral type the last bin ( smallest log(@xmath33 ) ) with stars in it corresponds to this measurement limit .",
    "table  [ table : lbolt ] gives the log(@xmath33 ) ) corresponding to an h@xmath0 ew of 1  for each spectral type .",
    "thus , the broader distributions seen at later types may be partly due to a selection effect .",
    "however , the distributions among the later types are quite symmetric and definitely declining at log(@xmath33 ) values that are easily measurable .",
    "therefore it appears that the activity strength covers a larger range , and is less sharply peaked , among the later type stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : lbol ] shows the mean of the @xmath33 distribution as a function of spectral type .",
    "the errors in this plot are the errors in the @xmath33 calculation added in quadrature with the 1@xmath34 distribution of each bin .",

    "the approximately constant value from m0-m5 is clearly shown , as is the decline starting at types m5-m6 .",

    "the effect has the opposite sign : @xmath38 = -0.11 @xmath36 0.16 .",
