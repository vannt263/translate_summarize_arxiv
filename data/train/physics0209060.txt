    "in a seminal work @xcite , aviram and ratner proposed almost thirty years ago to build elements of electronic circuits  in their case a rectifier  with single molecules . in the present days",
    "their vision starts to become reality and the experimental and theoretical study of such systems enjoys a vivid activity @xcite .",
    "recent experimental progress has enabled reproducible measurements @xcite of weak tunneling currents through molecules which are coupled by chemisorbed thiol groups to the gold surface of external leads . a necessary ingredient for",
    "future technological applications will be the possibility to control the tunneling current through the molecule .",
    "typical energy scales in molecules are in the optical and the infrared regime , where basically all of the today s lasers operate .",
    "hence , lasers represent a natural possibility to control atoms or molecules and also currents through them .",
    "it is for example possible to induce by the laser field an oscillating current in the molecule which under certain asymmetry conditions is rectified by the molecule resulting in a directed electron transport even in the absence of any applied voltage @xcite .",
    "another theoretically predicted effect is the current suppression by the laser field @xcite which offers the possibility to control and switch the electron transport by light .",
    "since the considered frequencies lie below typical plasma frequencies of metals , the laser light will be reflected at the metal surface , _ i.e. _ it does not penetrate the leads .",
    "consequently , we do not expect major changes of the leads bulk properties  in particular each lead remains close to equilibrium .",
    "thus , to a good approximation , it is sufficient to consider the influence of the driving solely in the molecule hamiltonian .",
    "in addition , the energy of infrared light quanta is by far smaller than the work function of a common metal , which is of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "this prevents the generation of a photo current , which otherwise would dominate the effects discussed below .",
    "recent theoretical descriptions of the molecular conductivity in non - driven situations are based on a scattering approach @xcite , or assume that the underlying transport mechanism is an electron transfer reaction from the donor to the acceptor site and that the conductivity can be derived from the corresponding reaction rates @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that both approaches yield essentially identical results in a large parameter regime @xcite . within a high - temperature limit",
    ", the electron transport on the wire can be described by inelastic hopping events @xcite .",
    "atoms and molecules in strong oscillating fields have been widely studied within a floquet formalism @xcite .",
    "this suggests utilizing the tools that have been acquired in that area , thus , developing a transport formalism that combines floquet theory for a driven molecule with the many - particle description of transport through a system that is coupled to ideal leads @xcite .",
    "such an approach is devised much in the spirit of the floquet - markov theory @xcite for driven dissipative quantum systems .",
    "the entire system of the wire in the laser - field , the leads , and the molecule - lead coupling as sketched in figure  [ fig : wire ] is described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 the wire is modeled by @xmath2 atomic orbitals @xmath3 , @xmath4 , which are in a tight - binding description coupled by hopping matrix elements .",
    "then , the corresponding hamiltonian for the electrons on the wire reads in a second quantized form @xmath5 where the fermionic operators @xmath6 , @xmath7 annihilate , respectively create , an electron in the atomic orbital @xmath3 and obey the anti - commutation relation @xmath8_+=\\delta_{n , n'}$ ] .",
    "the influence of the laser field is given by a periodic time - dependence of the on - site energies yielding a single particle hamiltonian of the structure @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is determined by the frequency @xmath11 of the laser field .",
    "the orbitals @xmath12 and @xmath13 at the left and the right end of the molecule , that we shall term donor and acceptor , respectively , are coupled to ideal leads ( cf .",
    "[ fig : wire ] ) by the tunneling hamiltonians @xmath14 the operator @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) annihilates an electron in state @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) on the left ( right ) lead .",
    "the leads are modeled as non - interacting electrons with the hamiltonian @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the single particle energy of the state @xmath21 and correspondingly for the right lead .",
    "as discussed above , the leads can be described by a grand - canonical ensemble of electrons , i.e.  by a density matrix @xmath22,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 are the electro - chemical potentials and @xmath24 the electron numbers in the left / right lead . as a consequence ,",
    "the only non - trivial expectation values of lead operators read @xmath25 here , @xmath26 denotes the fermi function .",
    "level structure of a molecular wire with @xmath27 atomic sites which are attached to two leads . ]      while the leads and the wire , including the driving , will be treated exactly , we take the wire - lead hamiltonian as a perturbation into account . starting from the liouville - von neumann equation",
    "@xmath28 $ ] together with the factorizing initial condition @xmath29 , we derive by standard techniques an approximate equation of motion for the total density operator @xmath30 .",

    ".   stems from the initial condition at @xmath38 in the integrated form of the liouville - von neumann equation . for the chosen factorizing initial condition",
    ", it will not contribute to the expectation values calculated below .",
    "the net ( incoming minus outgoing ) current through the left contact is given by the negative time derivative of the electron number in the left lead , multiplied by the electron charge @xmath39 , i.e.@xmath40 .\\ ] ] we insert @xmath41 from eq .   and obtain an expression that depends on the density of states in the leads times their coupling strength to the connected sites . at this stage",
    "it is convenient to introduce the spectral density of the lead - wire coupling @xmath42 which fully describes the leads influence .",
    "if the lead states are dense , @xmath43 becomes a continuous function . because we are mainly interested in the behavior of the molecule and not in the details of the lead - wire coupling , we assume that the conduction band width of the leads is much larger than all remaining relevant energy scales .",
    "consequently , we approximate in the so - called wide - band limit the functions @xmath43 by the constant values @xmath44 . after some algebra , we find for the _ time - dependent _ net electrical current through the left contact the expression @xmath45_+ f(\\epsilon-\\mu_l ) \\big\\ } , \\label{current_general}\\ ] ] and correspondingly for the current through the contact on the right - hand side . here",
    ", we made the assumption , that the leads are at all times well described by the density operator  .",
    "note that the anti - commutator @xmath46_+$ ] is in fact a c - number .",
    "like the expectation value @xmath47 it depends on the dynamics of the isolated wire and is influenced by the external driving .",
    "the first contribution of the @xmath48-integral in eq .",
    "is readily evaluated to yield an expression proportional to @xmath49 .",
    "thus , this term becomes local in time and reads @xmath50 .",
    "let us next focus on the single - particle dynamics of the driven molecule decoupled from the leads .",
    "since its hamiltonian is periodic in time , @xmath9 , we can solve the corresponding time - dependent schrdinger equation within a floquet approach .",
    "this means that we make use of the fact that there exists a complete set of solutions of the form @xcite @xmath51 .",
    "since the so - called floquet modes @xmath52 obey the time - periodicity of the driving field , they can be decomposed into the fourier series @xmath53 come in classes , @xmath54 of which all members represent the same solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "therefore , the quasienergy spectrum can be reduced to a single `` brillouin zone '' @xmath55 . in turn , all physical quantities that are computed within a floquet formalism are independent of the choice of a specific class member .",
    "thus , a consistent description must obey the so - called class invariance , i.e.it must be invariant under the substitution of one or several floquet states by equivalent ones , @xmath56 where @xmath57 are integers . in the fourier decomposition",
    ", the prefactor @xmath58 corresponds to a shift of the side band index so that the class invariance can be expressed equivalently as @xmath59 floquet states and quasienergies can be obtained from the quasienergy equation @xcite latexmath:[\\[\\label{floquet_hamiltonian } \\big(\\sum_{n , n'}|n\\rangle h_{nn'}(t ) \\langle n'|-i\\hbar\\frac{d}{dt}\\big )    a wealth of methods for the solution of this eigenvalue problem can be found in the literature .",
    "for an overview , we refer the reader to the reviews in refs .  , and the references therein .",
    "as the equivalent of the one - particle floquet states @xmath52 , we define a floquet picture for the fermionic creation and annihilation operators @xmath7 , @xmath6 , by the time - dependent transformation @xmath61 the inverse transformation @xmath62 follows from the mutual orthogonality and the completeness of the floquet states at equal times @xcite .",
    "note that the right - hand side of eq .   becomes @xmath63-independent after the summation .",
    "the operators @xmath64 are constructed in such a way that the time - dependences of the interaction picture operators @xmath65 separate , which will turn out to be crucial for the further analysis .",
    "indeed , one can easily verify the relation @xmath66 by differentiating the definition in the first line with respect to @xmath67 and using that @xmath52 is a solution of the eigenvalue equation .",
    "the fact that the initial condition @xmath68 is fulfilled completes the proof .",
    "the corresponding expression for the interaction picture operator in the on - site basis , @xmath69 , can be derived with help of eq .   at time",
    "@xmath70 together with to read @xmath71 equations  , , consequently allow to express the interaction picture operator @xmath72 appearing in the current formula via @xmath64 , dressed by exponential prefactors .",
    "this spectral decomposition allows one to carry out the time and energy integrals in the expression for the net current entering the wire from the left lead .",

    ", @xmath77 reduces to the density matrix in the basis of the floquet states which has been used to describe dissipative driven quantum systems in refs .  .",
    "the next step towards the stationary current is to find the fourier coefficients @xmath78 at asymptotic times . to this end",
    ", we derive from the equation of motion a master equation for @xmath76 .",
    "since all coefficients of this master equation , as well as its asymptotic solution , are @xmath79-periodic , we can split it into its fourier components .",
    "finally , we obtain for the @xmath78 the inhomogeneous set of equations @xmath80 for a consistent floquet description , the current formula together with the master equation must obey class invariance .",
    "indeed , the simultaneous transformation with of both the master equation and the current formula amounts to a mere shift of summation indices and , thus , leaves the current as a physical quantity unchanged .",
    "for the typical parameter values used below , a large number of sidebands contributes significantly to the fourier decomposition of the floquet modes @xmath81 .",
    "numerical convergence for the solution of the master equation , however , is already obtained by just using a few sidebands for the decomposition of @xmath76 .",
    "this keeps the numerical effort relatively small and justifies _ a posteriori _ the use of the floquet representation .",
    "yet we are able to treat the problem beyond the rotating - wave - approximation .",
    "equation implies that the current @xmath82 obeys the time - periodicity of the driving field .",
    "since we consider here excitations by a laser field , the corresponding driving frequency lies in the optical or infrared spectral range . in an experiment one",
    "will thus only be able to measure the time - average of the current .",
    "for the net current entering through the left contact it is given by @xmath83 .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] by replacing @xmath84 , one obtains for the current which enters from the right , @xmath85 , and the corresponding fourier coefficients and time averages .",
    "total charge conservation of the original wire - lead hamiltonian of course requires that the charge on the wire can only change by current flow , amounting to the continuity equation @xmath86 .",
    "since asymptotically , the charge on the wire obeys at most the periodic time - dependence of the driving field , the time - average of @xmath87 must vanish in the long - time limit . from the continuity equation one",
    "then finds that @xmath88 , and we can introduce the time - averaged current @xmath89 this continuity equation can be obtained directly from the average current formula together with the master equation , as has been explicitly shown in ref .  .",
    "as a working model we consider a molecule consisting of a donor and an acceptor site and @xmath90 sites in between ( cf .",
    "[ fig : wire ] ) .",
    "each of the @xmath2 sites is coupled to its nearest neighbors by a hopping matrix elements @xmath91 .",
    "the laser field renders each level oscillating in time with a position - dependent amplitude .",
    "thus , the corresponding time - dependent wire hamiltonian reads @xmath92\\delta_{nn ' } , \\label{wirehamiltonian } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is the scaled position of site @xmath3 .",
    "the energy @xmath94 equals the electron charge multiplied by the electrical field amplitude of the laser and the distance between two neighboring sites .",
    "the energies of the donor and the acceptor orbitals are assumed to be at the level of the chemical potentials of the attached leads , @xmath95 .",

    "the hopping matrix element @xmath91 serves as the energy unit ; in a realistic wire molecule , @xmath91 is of the order @xmath100 .",

    "let us first discuss the static problem in the absence of the field , i.e.  for @xmath115 .",
    "in the present case where the coupling between two neighboring sites is much weaker than the bridge energy , @xmath116 , one finds two types of eigenstates : one forms a doublet whose states are approximately given by @xmath117 .",
    "its splitting can be estimated in a perturbational approach @xcite and is approximately given by @xmath118 .",

    "these bridge states mediate the super - exchange between the donor and the acceptor .",
    "this yields an exponentially decaying length dependence of the conductance @xcite .",
    "this behavior changes significantly when a driving field with a frequency @xmath120 is switched on . then the resonant bridge levels merge with the donor and the acceptor state to form a floquet state .",
    "this opens a direct channel for the transport resulting in an enhancement of the electron current as depicted in figure  [ fig : peaks ] where we plot the current amplification , defined as the ratio of the time - averaged current to the current in the absence of the laser , @xmath121 : in a wire with @xmath27 sites , one finds peaks in the current when the driving frequency matches the energy difference between the donor / acceptor doublet and one of the @xmath122 bridge levels .",
    "the applied voltage is always chosen so small that the bridge levels lie below the chemical potentials of the leads .",
    "the amplification , can assume many orders of magnitude , cf.figure  [ fig : peaks ] . generally , the response of a system to a weak resonant driving scales with the damping and the driving amplitude .",
    "figure [ fig : scaling_f ] demonstrates this behavior for the peaks of the electrical current .",
    "the peak heights at the maxima of the time - averaged current are found proportional to @xmath123 .",
    "a further scaling behavior is found for the current peaks as a function of the wire length : the average current no longer exhibits the exponentially decaying length dependence that has been found for bridged super - exchange .",
    "by contrast , it emerges proportional to @xmath124 .",
    "this can be appreciated in figure  [ fig : scaling_n ] where the scale of the abscissa is chosen proportional to @xmath125 such that it suggests a common envelope function .",
    "put differently , the current is essentially inversely proportional to the length as in the case of ohmic conductance .    in summary , we find current peaks whose height @xmath126 scales according to @xmath127 thus , the current is especially for long wires much larger than the corresponding current in the absence of the driving .",
    "we have presented a detailed derivation of the floquet transport formalism which has been applied in refs .  .",
    "the analysis of a bridged molecular wire revealed that resonant excitations from the levels that connect the molecule to the external leads to bridge levels yield peaks in the current as a function of the driving frequency . in a regime with weak",
    "driving and weak electron - lead coupling , @xmath128 , the peak heights scale with the coupling strength , the driving amplitude , and the wire length .",
    "the laser irradiation induces a large current enhancement of several orders of magnitude .",
