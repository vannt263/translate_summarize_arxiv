    "although there is general consensus that type - ia supernova ( sn - ia ) explosions are the result of a thermonuclear runaway in a degenerate , approximately chandrasekhar - mass ( @xmath12 ) , carbon - oxygen stellar core ( e.g. , hillebrandt & niemeyer 2000 ; badenes et al .",
    "2006 ; mazzali et al .",
    "2007 ) , the progenitor systems of sne - ia are still unknown .",
    "the two main models leading to a sn - ia explosion are the single - degenerate ( sd ) model , in which a white dwarf ( wd ) accretes matter from a close companion until it approaches the chandrasekhar limit ( whelan & iben 1973 ; nomoto 1982 ) , and the double - degenerate ( dd ) model , involving the merger of two wds ( iben & tutukov 1984 ; webbink 1984 ) .",
    "however , both scenarios face theoretical and observational challenges",
    ". the outcome of a dd merger may be accretion - induced core collapse , rather than a sn - ia ( e.g. , nomoto & iben 1985 ; saio & nomoto 2004 , guerrero et al .",
    "2004 ) , although there are opposing views that invoke rotation of the stellar surface to prevent this outcome ( e.g. , piersanti et al .",
    "an observational search for dd progenitor systems ( napiwotzki et al . 2004 ; nelemans et al . 2005 ) has turned up , among @xmath13 wds surveyed , few or no potential dd systems with a total mass exceeding @xmath12 that will merge within a hubble time .",
    "the sd scenario , in turn , has been criticized ( e.g. , cassisi et al .",
    "1998 ; piersanti et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 ) for its assumptions about the existence of _ ad hoc _ mechanisms that regulate the accretion flow on to the wd ( e.g. hachisu et al . 1996 ) .",
    "observationally , badenes et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have noted the absence , in seven nearby sn - ia remnants , of the signatures of the strong wind from the accretor that supposedly stabilizes the accretion flow , and permits reaching @xmath12 .",
    "prieto et al . (",
    "2007 ) have found no evidence for a low - metallicity threshold in sn - ia hosts , in contrast to the predictions by kobayashi et al .",
    "( 1998 ; see also kobayashi & nomoto 2008 ) of such a threshold , due to a minimum metallicity that is required for the wind regulation mechanism to be effective . while evidence for circumstellar material , consistent with expectations from a wind from a red - giant companion , has been found in one recent normal sn - ia ( patat et al .",
    "2007 ) , such material is not observed in other events ( mattila et al .",
    "2005 ; simon et al . 2007 ; leonard 2007 ) . for the remnant of tycho s sn , which was a type - ia ( badenes et al",
    "2006 ) , there have been conflicting claims about the identification and nature of a remaining companion star ( ruiz - lapuente et al . 2004 ; fuhrmann 2005 ; ihara et al . 2007 ) .",
    "if , in the end , no companion is found , this would be another problem for the sd picture .",
    "recent metal abundance measurements suggest a type - ia explosion also in kepler s sn remnant ( e.g. , blair et al . 2007 ; reynolds et al . 2007 ) but the velocity of the remnant away from the galactic plane , together with evidence for a circumstellar medium from a massive progenitor , are problematic the context of a binary progenitor system ( reynolds et al . 2007 ) .    for core - collapse sne , which derive from massive ( @xmath14 ) stars , direct searches of pre - explosion images for progenitors",
    "have had a number of successes  in the case of sn1987a ( west et al .",
    "1987 ; white & malin 1987 ) , and several other events with suitable _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) data ( maund & smartt 2005 ; li et al .",
    "2006 ; hendry et al . 2006",
    "; gal - yam et al . 2007 ) . in contrast , the expectation , based on the sd and dd models , that sne - ia explode in old , low - mass , systems , has discouraged such direct searches for progenitors of sne - ia in the hst era . while there have been some studies of sn - ia environments using post - explosion hst data ( van dyk et al .",
    "1999 ) , the reverse has not been done , largely due to a preconception that the progenitors would be undetectable .",
    "( interestingly , van dyk et al .",
    "1999 noted young stellar populations in the vicinity of the four sne - ia they studied , but subtracted them off the images , arguing that the sne - ia were necessarily derived from an old population ) .",
    "however , several recent observational developments , in addition to the problems faced by the popular models , suggest that such a search may be useful after all .",
    "mannucci et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have measured stellar - mass - normalized type - ia sn rates as a function of galaxy hubble type and galaxy colors , and have found that the sn - ia rate in star - forming galaxies traces the star formation rate .",
    "such a correlation directly implies that at least some of the progenitors are young stars . this study and several subsequent ones ( scannapieco & bildsten 2005 ; mannucci et al .",
    "2006 ; sullivan et al . 2006 ; dilday et al .",
    "2008 ) have demonstrated that there must be a wide distribution of delay times between star formation and sn explosion , as predicted by some progenitor models ( e.g. , greggio & renzini , 1983 ; greggio 2005 ) .",
    "the spread in the delay times can be described in terms of two populations of progenitors : a `` prompt '' one , which dominates the sn - ia rate in star - forming galaxies and has a typical delay times of less than @xmath15  yr ; and `` tardy '' population , having a sn - ia delay time of @xmath16  yr ( or a large - delay tail to the same progenitor population above ) , needed to produce also the sn - ia rate measured in old stellar populations with no current star formation .",
    "an outstanding puzzle is the possible decrease in the sn - ia rate at redshifts @xmath17 measured by dahlen et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2008 ) , at a cosmic time when the star - formation rate was an order of magnitude higher than today . the sn - ia rate , which would therefore have then been dominated by the prompt population , would be expected to track the star formation rate , as the latter flattens or continues to rise to high @xmath18 . on the other hand , reanalysis of some of these data by kuznetsova et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and independent high-@xmath18 rates by poznanski et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , have questioned the significance of the claimed decrease in sn - ia rate at high redshift , pointing to the need for further observations to resolve the issue .    in any event , the formation of a degenerate carbon stellar core within @xmath19  yr for a significant fraction of sn - ia progenitors points to stars with zero - age main sequence ( zams ) masses of @xmath20 ( e.g. girardi et al .",
    "2000 ) . during their post - main - sequence evolution",
    ", such intermediate - mass stars may reach luminosities high enough to make them potentially detectable in pre - explosion hst images of nearby host galaxies .",
    "such evolved stars could be present in sn - ia progenitor systems , either in the role of mass donors to the wd ( previously produced by a more massive primary ) , where the evolutionary timescale of the secondary dictates the onset of the explosion ; or in the role of single - star sn - ia progenitors , where degenerate carbon - core ignition occurs in an evolved star that has somehow lost its hydrogen envelope ( e.g. tout 2005 ; waldman , yungelson , & barkat 2007 ) .",
    "furthermore , recent measurements of extragalactic sn - ia rates at various redshifts have yielded high rates , especially in star - forming environments .",
    "maoz ( 2008 ) has recently compiled , and compared self - consistently , different measurements of various observables related to sn rates , and used them to estimate the fraction of intermediate - mass close binaries that explode as sne - ia through the prompt and tardy channels .",
    "he shows that the high sn - ia rates ( as well as other independent observables such as intracluster abundances ) indicate that most or all close , intermediate - mass , binaries must explode as sne - ia , with , possibly , an excess of sne - ia over progenitor systems .",
    "this conclusion holds despite the uncertainties in the initial mass ranges that lead to viable wd sn - ia progenitors in the sd and dd scenarios , and the uncertainties in the initial parameters of binaries ( binarity fraction , mass ratio distributions , separation distributions ) .",
    "the conclusion stands in contrast to detailed sd and dd models that predict a small exploding fraction among the intermediate - mass population . the independent observation that a major part of the sn - ia population derives from a young population , indicating initial masses in a narrow range of @xmath21 ( see above ) , further culls the pool of potential progenitors , and makes the case for an excess of sn - ia explosions compared to progenitors almost unavoidable .",
    "a possible solution could , again , be evolved , single - star , stripped envelope , sn - ia progenitors .",
    "direct searches for such stars in pre - explosion images of the sites of sne - ia in nearby galaxies can test this scenario .    in this paper ,",
    "we perform such a search in the massive nearby galaxy ngc  1316 , a prolific sn producer that hosted two sn - ia events in 2006 , by analyzing deep pre - explosion hst images . after compiling some facts about this galaxy and its sne ,",
    "we describe the archival hst and ground - based data we have used , and their analysis for setting flux limits on individual progenitors for each of the two sne .",
    "we then discuss the physical limits on sn - ia progenitors imposed by these results .",
    "ngc  1316 ( fornax a ) is a giant elliptical radio galaxy in the fornax cluster . it is remarkable in many ways .",
    "it is extremely luminous ( m@xmath22=-22.39 ) and massive ( log(@xmath23)=11.9 , see mannucci et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "a prominent dust lane that cuts across it , with numerous additional dust features conspicuous throughout the galaxy , along with some kinematic signatures and analysis of its globular cluster system , all suggest that it has undergone a merger @xmath24  gyr ago ( e.g. schweizer 1980 ; goudfrooij et al .",
    "( a spectacular color rendition of the galaxy has been produced by the hubble heritage team , http://hubblesite.org ) .",

    "( 2005 ) have found evidence for increased sn rates in radio galaxies , of which ngc  1316 is a prime example .",
    "sharon et al . ( 2007 ) showed that cluster galaxies may have a higher sn - ia rate than that measured for local early - type galaxies by mannucci et al .",
    "mannucci et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found confirming evidence that cluster ellipticals have higher sn - ia rates than field ellipticals , and that this enhancement is independent of radio loudness .",
    "thus , galaxies that are both radio loud and in clusters have sn - ia rates larger by an order of magnitude than radio - quiet field ellipticals . using the sn rate appropriate for its environment and radio - loudness ( mannucci et al .",
    "2008 ) , 2.1 sne are expected in ngc  1316 in 27 years , while only 0.28 would be expected in a radio - quiet field elliptical of the same mass .",
    "while keeping in mind the dangers of _ a posteriori _ statistics , ngc  1316 may thus be an individual example of these statistical trends .",
    "although the dependences of sn - ia rate on radio loudness and environment still lack a satisfactory explanation ( and also require more observational confirmation ) , it is possible that these excesses of sne - ia are somehow related to the recent merger in ngc  1316 , and the star formation that likely ensued .",

    "however , ngc  1316 does have conspicuous dust features , raising the possibility that some extinction exists , and could affect our photometric limits .",
    "fortunately , the fact that this galaxy is an elliptical , with regular iso - brightness contours , permits evaluating a reasonable magnitude for this effect based on the images themselves . to do this , within each sn error circle , we find the pixel with the lowest flux , and compare it to the typical flux in unobscured regions along the same iso - brightness elliptical contour .",
    "this gives an estimate of the amount of attenuation a progenitor star would suffer if the dust were in a screen that is completely foreground to the diffuse stellar light along the line of sight , and the progenitor is completely behind the dust screen . with this procedure",
    ", we find maximum surface - brightness attenuations in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 of 0.7 , 0.8 , and 0.9 , respectively , at both sn sites .",
    "this then raises the point - source flux limits by about 0.4  mag , 0.25  mag , and 0.1  mag , in the three bands , respectively , as also listed in table  1 .",
    "naturally , less extinction will take place if , in reality , the star is in front of , or within , the dust clump , rather than behind it ; and the extinction will be underestimated if the dust is behind most of the diffuse stellar emission , rather than in front of it , as then the signature of the dust will not be seen .",
    "our procedure thus gives a plausible estimate of the possible attenuation , intermediate to these extreme scenarios , although of course we can not rule out that these extremes did occur .",
    "another possibility is that a progenitor was hidden behind a small clump of dust that is unresolved in the hst images , but which produced arbitrarily high extinction .",
    "however , as discussed above , none of these extreme scenarios are likely , in view of the colors and magnitudes of the events themselves .",

    "it should also be kept in mind that agb stars , which are prodigious dust producers during their thermal - pulse stages , are likely enshrouded in dust shells at the end of their evolution , and the exact point at which they become visible again on the post - agn branch is uncertain ( e.g. , bloecker 1995a , b ) .    in summary ,",
    "we have searched pre - explosion images of the sites of two sne - ia for potential luminous stellar progenitors , with null results .",
    "as always is the case in such studies , our null result does not conclusively rule out any of the scenarios or mass ranges for sn - ia progenitors . under any of the possibile scenarios of strong obscuration by dust ( by unresolved clumps , or by a screen that is behind the bulk of the stellar mass of the galaxy , or by a circumstellar shell ) ,",
    "more luminous progenitors could be hidden .",
    "furthermore , model predictions for the later stages of stellar evolution are still quite uncertain , all the more so if binary interactions take place . finally , sne 2006dd and 2006mr may have , by chance , belonged to the tardy sn - ia population , in which case one would not expect them to be associated with a young population .",
    "nevertheless , our study shows that deep hst observations of nearby sn hosts can graze some interesting regions of stellar parameter space that may be relevant for young - population sn - ia progenitors .",
    "future sne - ia will explode also in more nearby galaxies that have hst imagery .",
    "this will improve the statistics of such searches , will make accessible lower stellar luminosities , and will perhaps eventually reveal an actual progenitor . in view of the many unknowns behind sn - ia formation",
    ", such observational studies may provide valuable clues .",
