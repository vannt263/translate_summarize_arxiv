    "the last one that we should check here is when both the regions @xmath15 and @xmath36 are the monogons and no another region is the monogon .",
    "assume now that the regions @xmath15 and @xmath36 are the monogons and no another region is the monogon .",
    "every another region , in other words , a region @xmath13 or @xmath14 or @xmath19 or @xmath37 or @xmath38 or @xmath41 or @xmath40 or @xmath9 can not be the special bigon because of numbers and up and down informations of crossings that these regions contain .",
    "so this case is not included in the case of both monogons and bigons .",
    "above are all the cases that the monogons and the special bigons in the regions @xmath13@xmath9 do cover a single region in the two local disks in figure  [ riii3 ] .",
    "what we should check after that is the cases that the monogons and the special bigons in the regions @xmath13@xmath36 do not cover a single region in the two local disks in figure  [ riii3 ] .",
    "the monogon contains one crossing , so the monogon can not cover two regions in the two local disks in figure  [ riii3 ] . by considering that the special bigon contains two crossings ,",
    "what we should check here is the case that regions @xmath13@xmath15 or @xmath15@xmath19 or @xmath41@xmath36 or @xmath36@xmath9 are the single special bigon .",
    "( note here that the regions @xmath13@xmath19 or @xmath41@xmath9 can not be the single special bigon because of up and down informations of the crossings that the regions @xmath13@xmath19 and @xmath41@xmath9 contain . ) in fact , every these case can not occur because in every these case , a trivial split component appears in the local disk .",
    "see figure  [ riii_proof_example13 ] , for example .",
    "let us now prove the case of a move riii * as the proof of the move riii .",
    "the move riii * depicted in figure  [ riii * ] is obtained from a move riii * by applying same finitely many moves @xmath3 , @xmath4 to the outside of the two local disks for a move riii * until a move @xmath34 or @xmath35 can not be applied to the outside of the two local disks , whose every region adjacent to the two triangles is indicated by one alphabet .",
    "we say that this riii * depicted in figure  [ riii * ] is a special riii*. note that figure  [ riii * ] is the mirror image of figure  [ riii3 ] including alphabets .",
    "in fact , every case of the special riii * corresponds to the mirror image of a case of the special riii .",
    "for example , figure  [ riii*proofex1 ] is the mirror image of figure  [ riiiex3 ] . the same moves can be expressed by applying the moves ri and rii as in figures  [ riii*proofex1 ]  and  [ riiiex3 ] .",
    "all the riii * cases can be proved as this , since moves ri and rii which change same positions can be applied to the mirror images .",
    "hence , the result of all cases of the move riii * is the mirror image of figure  [ riii1 ] , in other words , figure  [ riii2 ] .    the processes which change the moves riii * into the moves riii also appear in the cases of the special riii * , and necessarily decrease the number of crossings .",
    "every these process which changes the move riii into the move riii * or the move riii * into the move riii decrease the number of crossings , so we can see that every these case results in the other cases because the number of crossings of every link diagram is finite .",
    "this means that we can disregard these cases , which completes the proof .      for understanding the meaning of corollary  [ corollary2 ]",
    ", we need to understand the circumstance here .",
    "we consider the ambient isotopy classes of all the diagrams of a given link , and we will examine the ri - ii equivalence classes containing these all diagrams as vertices . if each of two ri - ii equivalence classes contains a diagram such that they are transformed by applying a single reidemeister move iii or iii * , then we connect these two ri - ii equivalence classes with a edge .",
    "then we get a graph .",
    "all edges from every vertex may be infinite , but we give an upper bound for the number of edges ( from every vertex ) which do not increase minimal crossing number as the following corollary .",
    "[ corollary2 ] let @xmath0 be a diagram of a link without a trivial component , @xmath48 the ri - ii equivalence class containing @xmath0 .",
    "if we denote the set of all the ri - ii equivalence classes @xmath24-adjacent to the ri - ii equivalence class @xmath48 by @xmath49 , then the number of the triangles of reidemeister move iii or iii * in the minimal diagram of the ri - ii equivalence class @xmath48 gives an upper bound for @xmath50@xmath49 .    by theorem [ theorem2 ] , for a link without a trivial component ,",
    "every reidemeister moves iii and iii * is same of one of moves ( 1)(5 ) in figures  [ riii1 ]  and  [ riii2 ] in terms of the above graph .",
    "this means that in this case , every reidemeister moves iii and iii * which does not increase the minimal crossing number can be applied from the associated minimal diagram in terms of the above graph .",
