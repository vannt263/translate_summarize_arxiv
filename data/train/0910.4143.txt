    "the technique of rapid adiabatic passage ( rap ) @xcite provides a well - studied robust and efficient method for producing complete population transfer between two bound states of a quantum system .",
    "traditionally the population change has been accomplished by sweeping the carrier frequency of a laser pulse through resonance with a two - state system ( parameterized by detuning ) , while simultaneously pulsing the strength of the interaction ( parameterized as time - varying rabi frequency ) .",
    "the sweep of detuning corresponds to a crossing of diabatic energy curves , as noted below .",
    "when the interaction changes sufficiently slowly , so that the time evolution is adiabatic , there will occur a complete population transfer from the ground state ( of energy @xmath0 ) to the excited state ( energy @xmath1 ) .",
    "alternatively , one can make the detuning cross resonance by sweeping the transition frequency , e.g. by time - dependent electric or magnetic fields , as exemplified by the recently introduced technique of stark - chirped rapid adiabatic passage ( scrap ) @xcite .    in this paper we exploit a novel way of achieving complete population transfer via adiabatic evolution in two - state systems , using pulses that produce no crossing of diabatic energies .",
    "such population transfer is possible when diabatic energy curves touch , but do not cross , and simultaneously there occurs a sign change of the interaction ( the rabi frequency ) .",
    "coherent excitation of a two - state quantum system is described by the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) , which in the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) @xcite reads @xmath2 where @xmath3^t$ ] is a two - dimensional column - vector whose elements are the probability amplitudes @xmath4 and @xmath5 associated with the two quantum states @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the matrix representing the rwa hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath9.\\ ] ] the detuning @xmath10 expresses the frequency offset of the laser carrier frequency @xmath11 from the bohr transition frequency @xmath12 , each of which may vary with time .",
    "the rabi frequency @xmath13 quantifies the field - induced coupling between the two states . for the laser - atom excitation considered here",
    "this is the product of the atomic dipole transition moment @xmath14 in the field polarization direction , and the electric - field envelope @xmath15 of the laser field , @xmath16 .",
    "we shall take this to be a real - valued function of time .",
    "in writing the rwa hamiltonian we have chosen a symmetrized form , which is obtained by a suitable phase transformation of the probability amplitudes .",
    "the diagonal elements of @xmath17 are _",
    "diabatic energies_. curves of diabatic energies cross when @xmath18 changes sign .",
    "the ( time - dependent ) eigenvalues of @xmath17 are _ adiabatic energies _ , @xmath19 . by definition , @xmath20 is the larger of the two eigenvalues . as has long been known @xcite , eq for the two complex - valued probability amplitudes can be recast as three coupled equations for real - valued variables , that serve as the three components of a unit vector @xmath21^t$ ] in a three - dimensional abstract space .",

    "note that the direction of rotation will be reversed if the signs of @xmath13 and @xmath18 are both reversed .",
    "one of the three eigenvectors of @xmath26 , which corresponds to a null eigenvalue , is a sum of only two components , the coherence @xmath30 and the inversion @xmath31 , @xmath32 it has no component of @xmath33 ; in analogy with stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite , we shall refer to it as a _",
    "dark vector_. here the time - dependent mixing angle @xmath34 is defined by @xmath35 in contrast to the dark state of stirap , the dark vector @xmath36 can radiate via spontaneous emission from the excited state @xmath7 .",
    "it is important to note that the components of the dark vector are the normalized components of the torque vector .    below we describe several situations",
    "in which the time evolution is adiabatic , so that the bloch vector _ adiabatically follows _ the torque vector as , in accord with the design of the functions @xmath18 and @xmath13 , it moves in a two - dimensional plane of the abstract vector space .",
    "the pulses can be designed to produce either complete population inversion ( cpi ) , in which all population resides in state 2 at the completion of the pulses , or complete population return ( cpr ) , in which the initially populated state is completely repopulated after the pulses .",
    "figures [ fig - rap1 ] shows examples of adiabatic cpi or cpr in the presence of a level crossing ( the detuning crosses the resonance ) . the frames in the left column of fig .",
    "[ fig - rap1 ] illustrate cpi for the conventional rapid adiabatic passage ( rap ) by a frequency chirped laser pulse @xcite .",
    "top frames show the pulsed rabi frequency and detuning as a function of time , for which we have chosen [ frame a]&&(t ) = ^-(t/1.5t)^2 , + & & ( t ) = _ 0 ^-(t / t)^2 , the second frames show the eigenenergies , the third frames show the mixing angle @xmath34 , and the bottom frames show the components of the bloch vector .",
    "the frames in the right column of fig .",
    "[ fig - rap1 ] illustrate the situation when , in addition to the level crossing of the detuning , the rabi frequency also changes sign , [ frame b]&&(t ) = , + & & ( t ) = ^-(t / t)^2 , the temporal pulse area ",
    "the time integral of the rabi frequency  is here zero ( a  zero - area pulse \" ) . for this choice of antisymmetric rabi frequency and detuning ,",
    "exact cpr takes place .",
    "indeed , this property , which stems from the overall antisymmetry of the hamiltonian , is valid not only in the adiabatic limit but in the general case , and for arbitrarily many states @xcite .    for the left frames , during the excitation the mixing angle @xmath34 rotates from @xmath37 to @xmath38 and then to @xmath39 ( due to the change of the sign of the detuning ) , which leads to cpi because the system remains in the dark vector , which follows adiabatically the driving torque . for the right frames , during the excitation the mixing angle @xmath34 rotates from @xmath37 to @xmath38 and then back to @xmath40 ( due to the change of sign of the detuning and the rabi frequency at the crossings ) , which leads to cpr because , again , the system remains in the dark vector , but now it has different asymptotics .",
    "the choice of peak amplitudes for the pulses in these examples is such that a measurable value of bloch vector component @xmath33 occurs during intermediate stages of the process .",
    "as the motion becomes more adiabatic , and the adiabatic following more complete , this component becomes smaller .",
    "figure [ fig - rap2 ] shows a pair of cases , which do not appear to have been reported previously . in the left frames of fig .",
    "[ fig - rap2 ] we illustrate cpi in the absence of a level crossing , when the detuning does not cross but just touches the resonance .",
    "the detuning and the rabi frequency read [ frame c]&&(t ) = , + & & ( t ) = ^-(t/2.5t)^2 , during the excitation the mixing angle @xmath34 rotates from @xmath37 to @xmath41 , which leads to cpi in the adiabatic limit because the system remains in the dark vector .",
    "furthermore for the given example of antisymmetric pulse shape , the time - integrated rabi frequency ( the temporal pulse area ) is zero , but the zero pulse area is not a necessary constraint .",
    "this is a new approach to cpi , without a level crossing and with a possible zero pulse area .    the right frames of fig .",
    "[ fig - rap2 ] illustrate the case when the rabi frequency and the detuning are both even functions of time , [ frame d]&&(t ) = , + & & ( t ) = _ 0 ^-(t/2.5t)^2 , the mixing angle @xmath34 rotates from @xmath37 to @xmath38 and then to @xmath40 , which leads to cpi in the adiabatic limit because the system remains in the dark vector .",
    "in summary , the analysis above brings us to the following conclusions .",
    "cpi takes place in the adiabatic limit when ( i ) the coupling is an even function of time and the detuning is odd function of time ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , left frames of fig .",
    "[ fig - rap1 ] ) , or ( ii ) the coupling is odd function of time and the detuning is even function of time ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) , left frames of fig .",
    "[ fig - rap2 ] .",
    "when ( iii ) both functions are even function of time or ( iv ) both are odd function of time , then cpr is observed instead of cpi , right frames of figure [ fig - rap1 ] and [ fig - rap2 ] .",
    "these findings are summarized in table [ table ] .     &",
    "@xmath46 & @xmath47 & limit + [ fig - rap1 ] ( left ) & @xmath13 & @xmath48 & cpi + [ fig - rap1 ] ( right ) & @xmath49 & @xmath48 & cpr + [ fig - rap2 ] ( left ) & @xmath49 & @xmath18 & cpi + [ fig - rap2 ] ( right ) & @xmath13 & @xmath18 & cpr +    we emphasize here that the assumption of definite symmetry of the rabi frequency @xmath13 and the detuning @xmath18 , which was made in figures  [ fig - rap1 ] and [ fig - rap2 ] , and summarized in table [ table ] , is only a matter of convenience . in the adiabatic following approximation , which was assumed throughout , it is only the _ asymptotic _ behavior of the _ mixing angle _",
    "@xmath34 , which controls the composition of the dark vector , that matters .",
    "because the adiabatic passage is robust , the procedure of cpi with level touching ( left frames of figure [ fig - rap2 ] ) is also robust : it depends only weakly on the overlap of the coupling @xmath50 and the detuning @xmath51 and their peak values .",
    "moreover , the exact antisymmetry is not required , and high efficiencies can also be achieved with asymmetric time dependences .",
    "the only restriction of the pattern that we have to follow in order to achieve cpi is : the detuning starts before the coupling , becomes zero before the coupling changes sign , then rises again with the same sign and ends after the coupling ends .",
    "the torque - equation interpretation of the motion of the bloch vector provides a useful means of understanding the behaviors discussed above .",
    "figure [ fig - bloch sphere ] provides such a picture for the four frames of figures [ fig - rap1 ] and [ fig - rap2 ] and table [ table ] . in the adiabatic limit , which we assume , the bloch vector evolves in the plane @xmath52 , which is the @xmath53 slice of the bloch sphere .",
    "the geometrical representation of the adiabatic evolution of the bloch vector is easily determined because in the adiabatic limit the state vector coincides with the dark vector and is always parallel or anti - parallel to the driving torque .",
    "the concept of a zero - area laser pulse , when first encountered , may seem somewhat confusing .",
    "we have discussed such pulses in some detail elsewhere @xcite . here",
    "we describe briefly a few of the available techniques .    historically , the concept arose first in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , wherein typically spin-@xmath54 particles are controlled by slowly varying magnetic fields @xcite",
    ". a zero area field can be produced in an obvious manner , by appropriate tailoring of an applied voltage that can reverse the direction of the field and create the desired asymmetric pulse . in nmr",
    "the detuning @xmath18 is replaced by a longitudinal ( along the quantization axis ) magnetic pulse , and the rabi frequency @xmath13 by a transverse magnetic pulse .    in the optical spectrum zero - area pulses",
    "are formed when pulses are reshaped by self - induced transparency ( sit ) while propagating through an absorbing medium .",
    "initial pulse areas in the range @xmath55 will tend toward zero - area pulses  an expression of the mccall - hahn area theorem @xcite .    a zero - area pulse can also be produced by passing a laser pulse through a beam splitter and then recombining the two split pulses , after delaying one of them by a time delay @xmath56 and shifting its phase by @xmath57 .",
    "the recombined pulse , with rabi frequency @xmath58 , \\label{recombined}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the delay , is a zero - area pulse .",
    "such an implementation requires an interferometric stability within a wavelength @xmath59 .",
    "the most useful techniques , for ultrashort ( femtosecond and picosecond ) laser pulses , manipulate the fourier transform of the pulse , @xmath60 using pulse shapers . the pulse area",
    "@xmath61 is the value of this transform on resonance ( @xmath62 ) , @xmath63 thus a zero - area pulse can be produced by negating the resonant frequency component @xmath64 in its spatially dispersed fourier spectrum .",
    "the desired time variation of the detuning can be produced , using a pulse shaper , _ simultaneously _ with the manipulation of the rabi frequency .",
    "alternatively , the pulse of fig .",
    "[ fig - rap2](c ) can be produced by shaping the rabi frequency and the detuning _",
    "separately_. for example , the rabi frequency can still be shaped by a pulse shaper , whereas the detuning can be shaped by manipulating the bohr transition frequency ( rather than the laser carrier frequency through the spectral phase ) by using a pair of suitably delayed far - off - resonant stark - shifting laser pulses , as in scrap @xcite .",
    "cpi with a zero - area pulse has been reported in previous publications @xcite . however ,",
    "the physical mechanisms in these publications is different from the one reported here because the cpi in the present paper relies on adiabatic time evolution at all times . by contrast , in the previous proposals @xcite the sudden change of the phase of the field was essential , which led to sudden evolution , in the form of a delta - function shaped nonadiabatic coupling in the adiabatic basis .",
    "this required the use of pulses with large rabi frequencies , much larger than here .",
    "it is important to note that the zero - area condition is not required in any of these papers because the cpi mechanisms do not require it .",
    "the completely antisymmetric shape of the rabi frequency , @xmath65 , and the ensuing zero pulse area , is the most natural realization of a function that changes sign at time @xmath66 , but it is by no means necessary for the physical mechanisms .",
    "we have shown that complete population transfer , by means of adiabatic passage , is possible without any crossing of diabatic energy curves .",
    "it is necessary only that the curves touch , and that there be a sign change in the rabi frequency at that moment .",
    "such a scenario could be used to replace the conventional two - state rapid adiabatic passage via curve crossing for various implementations .",
