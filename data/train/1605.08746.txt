    "the scattering theory in periodic diffractive structures , which are known as diffraction gratings , has many significant applications in optical industry @xcite .",
    "the time - harmonic problems have been studied extensively in diffraction gratings by many researchers for acoustic , electromagnetic , and elastic waves @xcite .",
    "the underlying equations of these waves are the helmholtz equation , the maxwell equations , and the navier equation , respectively .",
    "this paper is concerned with the numerical solution of the elastic wave scattering problem in such a periodic structure .",
    "the problem has two fundamental challenges .",
    "the first one is to truncate the unbounded physical domain into a bounded computational domain .",
    "the second one is the singularity of the solution due to nonsmooth grating surfaces .",
    "hence , the goal of this work is two fold to overcome these two issues .",
    "first , we adopt the perfectly matched layer ( pml ) technique to handle the domain truncation .",
    "second , we use an a posteriori error analysis and design a finite element method with adaptive mesh refinements to deal with the singularity of the solution .",
    "the research on the pml technique has undergone a tremendous development since brenger proposed a pml for solving the time - dependent maxwell equations @xcite .",
    "the basis idea of the pml technique is to surround the domain of interest by a layer of finite thickness fictitious material which absorbs all the waves coming from inside the computational domain .",
    "when the waves reach the outer boundary of the pml region , their energies are so small that the simple homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions can be imposed .",
    "various constructions of pml absorbing layers have been proposed and investigated for the acoustic and electromagnetic wave scattering problems @xcite .",
    "the pml technique is much less studied for the elastic wave scattering problems @xcite , especically for the rigorous convergence analysis .",
    "we refer to @xcite for recent study on convergence analysis of the elastic obstacle scattering problem .",
    "combined with the pml technique , an effective adaptive finite element method was proposed in @xcite to solve the two - dimensional diffraction grating problem where the one - dimensional grating structure was considered . due to the competitive numerical performance , the method was quickly adopted to solve many other scattering problems including the obstacle scattering problems @xcite and the three - dimensional diffraction grating problem @xcite .",
    "based on the a posteriori error analysis , the adaptive finite element pml method provides an effective numerical strategy which can be used to solve a variety of wave propagation problems which are imposed in unbounded domains .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the possibility of applying such an adaptive finite element pml method to solve the diffraction grating problem of elastic waves .",
    "specifically , we consider the incidence of a time - harmonic elastic plane wave on a one - dimensional grating surface , which is assumed to be elastically rigid . the open space , which is above the surface , is assumed to be filled with a homogeneous and isotropic elastic medium .",
    "using the quasi - periodicity of the solution and the transparent boundary condition , we formulate the scattering problem equivalently into a boundary value problem in a bounded domain .",
    "the conservation of energy is proved for the model problem and is used to verify our numerical results when the exact solutions are not available . following the complex coordinate stretching ,",
    "we study the truncated pml problem which is an approximation to the original scattering problem .",
    "we develop the transparent boundary condition for the truncated pml problem and show that it has a unique weak solution which converges exponentially to the solution of the original scattering problem .",
    "moreover , an a posteriori error estimate is deduced for the discrete pml problem .",
    "it consists of the finite element error and the pml modeling error .",
    "the estimate is used to design the adaptive finite element algorithm to choose elements for refinements and to determine the pml parameters .",
    "numerical experiments show that the proposed method can effectively overcome the aforementioned two challenges .",
    "this paper presents a nontrivial application of the adaptive finite element pml method for the grating problem from the helmholtz ( acoustic ) and maxwell ( electromagnetic ) equations to the navier ( elastic ) equation .",
    "the elastic wave equation is complicated due to the coexistence of compressional and shear waves that have different wavenumbers and propagate at different speeds . in view of this physical feature ,",
    "we introduce two scalar potential functions to split the wave field into its compressional and shear parts via the helmholtz decomposition . as a consequence ,",
    "the analysis is much more sophisticated than that for the helmholtz equation or the maxwell equations .",
    "we believe that this work not only enriches the range of applications for the pml technique but also is a valued contribution to the family of numerical methods for solving elastic wave scattering problems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the model problem of the elastic wave scattering by a periodic surface and formulate it into a boundary value problem by using a transparent boundary condition .",
    "the conservation of the total energy is proved for the propagating wave modes . in section 3 , we introduce the pml formulation and prove the well - posedness and convergence of the truncated pml problem .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the finite element approximation and the a posteriori error estimate . in section 5 ,",
    "we discuss the numerical implementation of our adaptive algorithm and present some numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of the proposed method .",
    "the paper is concluded with some general remarks and directions for future research in section 6 .",
    "in this section , we introduce the model problem and present an exact transparent boundary condition to reduce the problem into a boundary value problem in a bounded domain .",
    "the energy distribution will be studied for the reflected propagating waves of the scattering problem .",
