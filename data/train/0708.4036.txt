    "it is well - known that the category of representations with iwahori fixed vectors admits an involution called the iwahori - matsumoto involution , denoted by @xmath5 , which takes hermitian modules to hermitian modules , and unitary modules to unitary modules ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular it interchanges spherical modules with generic modules .",
    "for example , @xmath5 takes the trivial representation into the steinberg representation .",
    "thus this paper also gives a classification of the spherical unitary dual of split p - adic groups of type @xmath6 completing the classification of the spherical unitary dual as well .",

    "if @xmath33 is adjoint , a subquotient is both generic and spherical if and only if it is the full @xmath34 ( in other words , if @xmath34 is irreducible ) .    the results in @xcite show that in the @xmath36adic case the classification of the iwahori - spherical unitary dual is equivalent to the corresponding problem for the iwahori - hecke algebra . in @xcite ,",

    "is the computation of signature characters : in the real case on @xmath104types , and in the @xmath1-adic case on @xmath105types .",

    "the methods employed there are very different from this paper .",
    "more precisely , to every petite @xmath104type there corresponds a weyl group representation such that the signature characters are the same .",
    "but only a small number of weyl group representations correspond in this way to petite @xmath104types . in this paper , we inherently use signature computations for _ all _ weyl group representations . therefore , the results here can not be used directly towards the spherical unitary dual of the corresponding split real groups .",
    "in different work however , we studied the signature of petite @xmath104types for exceptional groups of type @xmath0 .",
    "the main consequence of that work is that the spherical unitary dual for a split real group @xmath106 is a _ subset _ of the spherical unitary dual for the corresponding @xmath1-adic group @xmath107 ( conjecturally they are the same ) .",
    "details will appear elsewhere .",
    "[ [ 1.1a ] ]    to obtain the results of this paper , we made a minimal use of computer calculations , essentially for linear algebra , _ e.g.  _ conjugation of semisimple elements by the weyl group , or multiplication of matrices in a variable @xmath96 for some of the `` maximal parabolic '' cases in section [ sec:3.1 ] .",
    "however , by the machinery presented in sections [ sec:2.11 ] and [ sec : alcoves ] , for every given hecke algebra @xmath54 , one can reduce the identification of the unitary parameters @xmath26 to a brute force computer calculation .",
    "more precisely , one considers sample points with rational coordinates for every facet in the arrangement of hyperplanes given by coroots equal to @xmath108 in the dominant weyl chamber .",
    "( these are the hyperplanes where @xmath34 is reducible . )",
    "it is known ( see @xcite ) that the signature of the long intertwining operator is constant on each facet of this arrangement .",
    "one can then run a computer calculation of the long intertwining spherical operator ( section [ sec:2.11 ] ) on _ each _ representation of the weyl group at _ every _ sample point .",
    "then one finds the signature of the resulting hermitian matrices .",
    "the unitary parameters @xmath26 correspond to those facets for which these matrices are positive semidefinite for all weyl group representations .",
    "the size of the calculation can be reduced significantly by making use of some ideas in this paper .",
    "this is _ not _ the approach of this paper , but we did carry out this calculation independently for exceptional groups in order to confirm the results of this paper .",
