    "introduce the concept of _ thin position _ for 3-manifolds ; the idea is to build the manifold as described before , with a sequence of 1-handles and 2-handles chosen to keep the boundaries of the intermediate steps as simple as possible .",
    "the morse theory of circle - valued maps @xmath12 , as in the real case , relates the topology of a manifold @xmath5 to the critical points of @xmath13 .",
    "morse - novikov theory was introduced by novikov @xcite to study these functions .",
    "see @xcite for a survey of these topics .",
    "recently there has been work on circle - valued morse theory on the complement of knots and links in @xmath14 . in @xcite , pajitnov , rudolph and weber introduced the concept of the _ morse - novikov _ number of a link @xmath15 .",
    "the _ morse - novikov number _ of a link , denoted by @xmath16 , is the least possible number of critical points of a regular circle - valued morse mapping @xmath17 .",
    "they proved that the morse - novikov number is subadditive with respect to the connected sum of knots ; i.e. @xmath18 .    in @xcite , goda pointed out that there is a handle decomposition which corresponds to a circle - valued morse map , which he calls a heegaard splitting for sutured manifolds .",
    "we can consider more general circle - valued morse functions on knot complements which correspond to handle decompositions that do not necessarily arise from a heegaard splitting .",
    "analogous to scharlemann and thompson , we describe a process to re - order the handles of a handle decomposition of a knot exterior in such a way that the regular level surfaces are as simple as possible , giving rise to the definition of _ circular width of the knot exterior _ and _ circular thin position of the knot exterior_. similarly to regular thin position , circular thin position guarantees that all the level surfaces are either incompressible or weakly incompressible .",
    "hence when the knot exterior is in circular thin position we obtain a nice sequence of seifert surfaces which are alternately incompressible and weakly incompressible .",
    "in general we expect to see several such level surfaces .",
    "however there are some special cases . recall that a fibered knot @xmath19 is a knot with a seifert surface @xmath20 whose knot complement can be fibered over @xmath21 with fiber @xmath20 .    in our context",
    "a fibered knot is a knot whose knot exterior has a circular thin position with one and only one incompressible level surface and none weakly incompressible level surface .",
    "this is the unique circular thin position for a fibered knot , see @xcite or @xcite , and as expected , circular thin position yields no additional seifert surfaces for the knot .",
    "the circular width of a fibered knot is defined to be zero .",
    "we define an almost fibered knot to be a knot whose complement possesses a circular thin position in which there is one and only one weakly incompressible seifert surface @xmath22 and one and only one incompressible seifert surface @xmath23 .",
    "goda @xcite showed that all non - fibered knots up to ten crossings are handle number one knots . in our context",
    "these knots have a circular thin position with one incompressible seifert surface @xmath23 of minimal genus and a weakly incompressible seifert surface @xmath22 with genus(s)= genus(f)+1 .",
    "thus , all non - fibered knots up to ten crossings are examples of almost fibered knots .",
    "goda s examples also illustrate that almost fibered knots do not have a unique circular thin position .",
    "he describes knots with two non - isotopic minimal genus seifert surfaces which can be used to find two different circular thin positions , both giving the structure of an almost fibered knot .",
    "given all these concepts and definitions we prove the main theorem :    let @xmath19 .",

    "@xmath4 is fibered ; 2 .",

    "moreover this closed essential surface is in the complement of an incompressible seifert surface for the knot ; 4 .",
    "@xmath4 has at least two non - isotopic incompressible seifert surfaces .",
    "we also study the behavior of circular width under two natural operations on knot exteriors .",
    "given two knots @xmath24 and @xmath25 in @xmath14 , we can take their connected sum , or we can glue their exteriors together along their common boundary ensuring that preferred longitudes match .    in both cases ,",
    "we find upper bounds for the circular width of the resulting manifold , which depend on the circular width of the original knot exteriors .",
    "it is natural to ask for an example of a knot which is neither fibered nor almost fibered .",
    "the candidate we propose is the connected sum of two almost fibered knots .",
    "as we will see in section [ section4 ] this connected sum inherits a circular structure from the knot summands .",

    "we construct new manifolds , in one case the exterior of the connected sum of two knots and in the other case a closed manifold . in both cases there",
