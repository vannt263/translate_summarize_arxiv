    "the hubbard model has been employed for a long time as a standard model for metallic ferromagnetism of itinerant electrons@xcite .",

    "many investigations revealed that a simple single - band hubbard model on a hyper - cubic lattice may not exhibit ferromagnetism .",
    "some additional features in the model seem to be necessary in order to stabilize ferromagnetism .",
    "one of such features is a special lattice or band structure .",
    "lieb first showed that a half - filled flat band induces a net magnetization@xcite .",
    "then mielke and tasaki introduced other examples of flat - band ferromagnets@xcite .",
    "tasaki proved , furthermore , that a class of models with half - filled lowest bands with finite band dispersions exhibits ferromagnetism for sufficiently strong intra - atomic repulsions@xcite .",
    "mller - hartmann found ferromagnetism in a one - dimensional system where the band dispersion has two minima@xcite .",
    "it was also shown by perturbational as well as numerical methods that partially filled bands in such systems can realize ferromagnetism@xcite .    another important factor realizing ferromagnetism",
    "was discussed to be degeneracy of atomic orbitals@xcite .",
    "actually magnetic carriers of typical metallic ferromagnets originate from the degenerate 3@xmath8-orbitals , though they are mixed with @xmath9- or @xmath10-orbitals . in the presence of degenerate orbitals",
    ", hund coupling favors local triplet spin configurations of two electrons occupying different orbitals at the same site .",
    "following mechanisms were proposed which lead to bulk ferromagnetism from intra - atomic hund coupling .",
    "zener proposed the so - called _",
    "double exchange _ mechanism originally for doped manganites , which works when the electron density per site is not an integer@xcite , e.g. , the density of electrons per site ( @xmath6 ) is between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "if electrons are strongly correlated , each lattice site is occupied by either @xmath11 or @xmath12 electrons , and hund coupling forces their spins to be parallel in an atom .",
    "the magnitude of the formed atomic spin is @xmath13 or @xmath14 for @xmath15 , and @xmath16 or @xmath17 for @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes the degree of degeneracy .",
    "an electron can hop from a site occupied by @xmath12 electrons to a site occupied by @xmath11 electrons .",
    "since the hopping matrix is diagonal with respect to the spin indices , an electron can hardly hop between sites whose spins are directed antiparallelly , while it can freely propagate among sites with parallel spins . as a result ,",
    "ferromagnetic spin alignment that lowers the kinetic energy is favored .",
    "another mechanism leading to ferromagnetism is most effective when the electron density per site is an integer , @xmath20 , where @xmath11 is an integer which satisfies @xmath21 or @xmath22@xcite .",
    "each site is occupied by @xmath11 electrons in the strong coupling regime and hoppings of electrons occur as virtual processes .",
    "the intermediate state of a second order process has the lowest energy if the spins are aligned parallelly .",
    "this leads to an effective ferromagnetic exchange interaction that induces orbital ordering at the same time .",
    "van vleck argued that the ferromagnetic exchange due to virtual hoppings might be the origin of the metallic ferromagnetism in ni@xcite .    though the mechanisms favoring ferromagnetism can be qualitatively understood as above , it is far from trivial whether ferromagnetic long - range order occurs in bulk systems .",
    "we need to examine whether the models with orbital degeneracy really simulate ferromagnets by reliable methods . for this purpose , we study the simplest model with orbital degeneracy , the hubbard model with doubly degenerate atomic orbitals .",
    "the model is described by the hamiltonian @xmath23 where @xmath24 @xmath25 creates ( annihilates ) an electron at the site @xmath26 with spin @xmath27 ) in the orbital @xmath28 .",
    "here we assumed that only the hoppings between the same orbitals exist , and the coulomb interaction works only between electrons on a same site .",

    "the last symmetry holds if the coupling parameters satisfy the relations ( [ eq : rel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rel2 ] ) , and it could be easily seen in the effective hamiltonian derived in the strong coupling limit@xcite . because of this rotational symmetry , a rigorous argument for one - dimensional systems excludes oscillating orbital lro corresponding to @xmath43-correlations@xcite . in the limit of @xmath44 , the symmetry of orbital degrees of freedom becomes su(2 ) invariant and the whole hamiltonian has the high symmetry su(4 ) .",
    "we assume the relations ( [ eq : rel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rel2 ] ) , and assume all interaction parameters to be positive throughout this work . in realistic situations the parameters satisfy @xmath45 , but we study the strong hund coupling case @xmath46 as well , for theoretical interest .",
    "let us explain the level structure of a doubly occupied atomic site since it rules the physics of the model ( [ eq : deghub ] ) .",
    "the spin - triplet states , where two electrons occupy different orbitals , have the lowest energy @xmath1 .",
    "in one of three spin - singlet states , electrons occupy different orbitals and the energy is @xmath47 . in the other two singlets with the energies @xmath48 and @xmath49 , electrons occupy the same orbital . in the strongly correlated regime where @xmath50 , almost all sites are empty or singly occupied for @xmath3 , while they are singly or doubly occupied for @xmath4 and",
    "spins in a doubly occupied site form a triplet .",
    "thus the ground state properties for @xmath51 strongly depend on whether @xmath6 is less than , equal to or more than unity .",
    "if @xmath31 is larger than @xmath30 , a doubly occupied site has negative interaction energy and hence electrons tend to form bound triplet pairs . in this case , sites are empty or doubly occupied for @xmath52 if @xmath53 is even",

    "roth examined the model in three dimensions in the quarter - filled case ( @xmath2)@xcite .",
    "she found that the ferromagnetic ground state has an orbital superlattice structure in which two sublattices are occupied by electrons of different orbitals when the interaction is strong .",
    "this kind of ground state was studied by using an effective hamiltonian in the strong coupling limit@xcite and by means of the mean field theory for general electron density@xcite .",

    "hirsch studied the less - than - quarter - filled case and found the ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "their results , however , depend strongly on the boundary conditions and the number of lattice sites",
    ". there are rigorous proofs for the ferromagnetic ground state in strong coupling limits in one dimension@xcite .",

    "_ studied ferromagnetism in the three - dimensional two - band model with rather realistic dos for ni using a gutzwiller approximation .",
    "their results showed that increase of dos at the fermi level could stabilize ferromagnetism for electron - doped cases ( @xmath64)@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we studied the ground state of the model ( [ eq : deghub ] ) in one dimension under open boundary condition , using the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method@xcite .",
    "this method enables us to study larger systems than those studied previously .",
    "owing to the open boundary condition , we found remarkably little size - dependence .",
    "if we apply the periodic boundary condition , electrons can exchange their positions turning around the chain and it causes very large size - dependence of the ground state ( e.g. even - odd oscillations ) .",
    "preliminary results of this study were reported previously in ref .  .",
    "this paper is constructed as follows : in section [ sec : method ] , we briefly review the dmrg method . in section [ sec :",
    "main - result ] , we study the present model with only nearest - neighbor hoppings and report our numerical results , such as magnetic phase diagrams .",
    "ferromagnetic phases appear for a wide parameter region and for all electron density ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "in most of density region , the ferromagnetic states are fully polarized , whereas partially polarized ferromagnetic states are found in a small region ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "we also found coexistence of metallic ferromagnetism and quasi - long - range order of triplet superconductivity when the hund coupling is stronger than the inter - orbital coulomb repulsion ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "near the half - filling case ( @xmath67 ) , phase separation occurs , and the paramagnetic ( haldane ) phase and ferromagnetic one coexist . in section [ sec : sub - result ] , we examine the stability of the ferromagnetic states obtained in section [ sec : main - result ] , adding perturbation to the density of states .",
    "the metallic ferromagnetic order for more than quarter - filling ( @xmath68 ) is stable against this perturbation , but , for less than quarter - filling ( @xmath3 ) , it easily becomes unstable by this variation . finally , we give summary and discussion in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "appendixes contain rigorous results in the strong coupling limit .",
    "using charge and spin - orbital separation , we show that the ferromagnetic spin state for less than quarter - filling is the same as one at quarter - filling .",
    "the ferromagnetism at less than quarter - filling is created by the exchange interaction produced by virtual second - order hopping processes .",
    "we obtained the ground state of the model ( [ eq : deghub ] ) with up to 62 sites using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method@xcite .",
    "the method is standard and we will not describe it in detail .",
    "readers should refer to white s paper for the dmrg method .",
    "we note only several points particular to this study .",
    "we employed the open boundary condition throughout this paper . in the dmrg calculations",
    ", we always kept rotational symmetry in the spin space so that the obtained ground state is an eigenstates of the total spin@xcite .",
    "we used the finite - system method of dmrg to obtain the ground - state phase diagrams of the model with up to 16 sites .",
    "this method is superior to the infinite - system method in terms of accuracy of the ground - state quantities of finite systems .",
    "another merit of this method is that the final result does not depend so strongly on the ground state of the initial small system and on the path of the renormalization process as in the infinite - system method .",
    "repeated sweeps of the renormalization processes in the finite - system method can usually remedy the failure due to a wrong initial state .",
    "near the phase boundary between a paramagnetic phase and a ferromagnetic one with saturated magnetization , however , the final results sometimes depend on the choice of the renormalization paths .",
    "for example , two different choices of the paths @xmath69 and @xmath70 give a perfect ferromagnetic ground state and a paramagnetic one , respectively , at @xmath71 for @xmath72 , where @xmath53 and @xmath73 are the number of electrons and lattice sites , respectively . since the transition is of first order , the energy levels of a paramagnetic state and a ferromagnetic one naturally exist very close to each other near the phase boundary .",
    "to study the phase diagram carefully , we searched the ground state through many renormalization paths .",
    "finally , we regard the lowest energy state as the ground state . hence",
    ", we need to try several paths and initial states and compare their results in order to obtain a reliable phase diagram as long as the number @xmath74 of reserved eigenstates of the density matrix is finite .",
    "the maximum number of @xmath74 was chosen to be 200 in this study for technical reasons .    in order to calculate longer correlations we also studied the systems with up to 62 sites using the infinite - system dmrg method",

    "one possibility of this discrepancy may be that ferromagnetic phase appears in a very narrow region for the hole - doped case and mk could not discover it . as another possibility ,",

    ", hv adopted a semi - elliptic dos . on the other hand , in ref .",
    ", mk used a gaussian dos , which is the exact one for the hyper - cubic lattice in infinite dimensions .",
    "as we showed in the present paper , the shape of dos can greatly affect the appearance of ferromagnetism for @xmath3 .",
    "since the long tail of the gaussian dos is disadvantageous to ferromagnetism at low densities , the discrepancy of the phase diagrams presumably comes from the choice of dos .",
