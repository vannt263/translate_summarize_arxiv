    "the global dynamics of networks of @xmath2 coupled oscillators with different types of coupling has been studied in @xcite . in their formalism",
    "it is shown that the symmetry group of the network can be considered a subgroup of @xmath3 , as long as the oscillators taken individually have no internal symmetries .",
    "these ideas have been investigated in the above cited paper , for general @xmath4 and @xmath5 cases .",
    "however , it is a routine considering @xmath6 so the case @xmath0 is sometimes not explicitly taken into account .",
    "another reason for carrying out our study is the fact that among the dihedral groups , @xmath0 is the only abelian group , which makes its action and therefore its analysis slightly different .    in this paper",
    "we are concerned with two properties of networks with @xmath0 symmetry : hopf bifurcation and low coupling case leading to heteroclinic cycles .",
    "firstly we use the methodology developed by ashwin and stork @xcite to construct a network of differential systems with @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "our case is a particular situation of a network of @xmath2 coupled oscillators with symmetry to be a subgroup of @xmath7 that analyzes different types of coupling between the oscillators , as shown in @xcite .",
    "while this approach has been successfully used for the subgroups @xmath5 and @xmath8 our approach is interesting not only because of the particularities already mentioned of @xmath9 but also because it offers the possibility of analyzing the weak coupling limit , where dynamics of the network is governed only by the phases of the oscillators . +",
    "a large variety of subgroups of @xmath3 can be easily generated by the method described by ashwin and stork @xcite based on graph theory .",
    "the automorphism group of the colored graph can be defined to be its symmetry group .",
    "therefore , it is possible , via cayley graphs , to design oscillatory networks with the prescribed symmetry of a subgroup of @xmath10 while the hopf bifurcation is in fact a simple adaptation of the theory developed by golubitsky , stewart and schaeffer in @xcite,@xcite and @xcite , the low coupling case is much more interesting since it allows the existence of heteroclinic cycles in systems with @xmath0 symmetry . in this case",
    "it is possible to reduce the asymptotic dynamics to a flow on an four - dimensional torus @xmath11 by assuming a weak coupling we average the whole network and introduce an extra @xmath12 symmetry .",
    "we determine the two - dimensional invariant subspaces on this torus and show that a heteroclinic cycle consisting of four one - dimensional routes among the four zero - dimensional equilibria can appear .",
    "we then apply the general stability theory for heteroclinic cycles developed by krupa and melbourne in @xcite , to analyze the stability of the heteroclinic cycles .",
    "our aim is to construct an oscillatory system with the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "to achieve this goal we need first to represent the group by a cayley diagram .",
    "a cayley diagram is a graph ( that is , a set of nodes and the arrows between them ) to represent a group .",
    "vertex or nodes of the graph are the group elements and the arrows show how the generators act on the elements of the group . at any vertex",
    "there are arrows pointing towards it , others pointing away .",
    "proceeding as in @xcite or @xcite , let @xmath13 be the generating set of @xmath14 this implies that    * @xmath15 generates @xmath9 * @xmath15 is finite and * @xmath16    since @xmath0 is finite we can forget assumptions @xmath17 and @xmath18 then the cayley graph of @xmath0 , is a directed colored graph whose arrows indicate the action the group elements have on each other and the vertices are the group elements . as shown in @xcite the generating set",
    "@xmath15 is a set of `` colors '' of the directed edges and the group elements @xmath19 and @xmath20 are connected through an edge from @xmath19 to @xmath20 of color @xmath21 if and only if @xmath22     group .",
    "solid arrows represent left - multiplication with @xmath23 dot - and - dashed arrows left multiplication with @xmath24 the two generators of this group.,width=293,height=291 ]    ( 0,0 ) ( -90,235 ) ( 83,235 ) ( -90,55 ) ( 83,55 )    the cayley graphs for @xmath0 is shown in figure . following the approach by stork et al .",
    "@xcite , we may identify the vertices as cells with a certain dynamics and the edges as couplings between the cells . in this way we can construct an ode system which has the symmetry of @xmath0 .",
    "the action of the group @xmath0 on the cells can be written as @xmath25 where the two generators and their commuting product @xmath26 act on @xmath27 as @xmath28    if we assign coupling between cells related by the permutations in , we can build the following pairwise system in with the @xmath0 symmetry .    @xmath29    where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "as shown by ashwin and stork @xcite we can think of @xmath32 as being generic functions that assure that the isotropy of this vector field under the action of @xmath33 is generically @xmath0 .",
    "the group @xmath0 has order @xmath34 , the generators being @xmath35 since all irreducible representations of the @xmath0 group are one dimensional , we restrict our study to the actions of the generators on @xmath36 the orthogonal representation of @xmath0 @xmath37 on the complex vector space @xmath38 is irreducible if and only if the only @xmath39invariant subspaces of @xmath38 are the trivial ones .",
    "in fact it can be shown that @xmath40 the group element @xmath41 acts on the point @xmath42 by @xmath43 the orbit of a point @xmath44 under the action of @xmath0 is @xmath45 therefore the orbits are    * the origin , @xmath46 * points on the @xmath47-axis , @xmath48 with @xmath49 * points on the @xmath50-axis , @xmath51 with @xmath52 * points off the axes @xmath53 with @xmath54    the isotropy subgroup of a point @xmath44 under the action of @xmath0 is @xmath55 @xmath0 has four isotropy subgroups :    * @xmath0 corresponding to the origin * @xmath56 corresponding to @xmath57 with @xmath58 * @xmath59 corresponding to @xmath60 with @xmath61 * @xmath62 corresponding to @xmath63 with @xmath64    in this section we basically recall the theory of golubitsky and stewart @xcite and @xcite on one parameter hopf bifurcations with symmetry .",
    "the group @xmath0 only has four @xmath66dimensional real irreducible representations and so they are absolutely irreducible .",
    "one of them is the trivial representation and the other three are non - isomorphic each with a nontrivial @xmath67 action .",
    "therefore , the only possible way to have a hopf bifurcation is for the linearization at the equilibrium to be from a @xmath68simple subspace of the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 is an absolutely irreducible representation which has either a trivial or a @xmath67 action .",
    "generically , as a parameter is varied , the critical eigenspace with purely imaginary eigenvalues is two - dimensional of the form @xmath69 described above .",
    "the periodic solution bifurcating is unique and has the same symmetry has the @xmath67 action on v , or has no symmetry .",
    "in fact , the @xmath0 symmetric coupled system does not support any periodic solution .",
    "one can easily show that the isotypic decomposition at a trivial steady - state is made up of the trivial representation @xmath71 and the complement decomposes into the remaining three non - isomorphic irreducible representations .",
    "therefore , the @xmath69 subspace can not exist in the tangent space at the trivial equilibrium .",
    "each cell in the network needs to be two - dimensional to hope to have a hopf bifurcation with @xmath0 symmetry in such a @xmath72cell system .    for the @xmath39equivariant hopf bifurcation in @xmath73",
    ", there is a unique branch of periodic solutions consisting of rotating waves with @xmath67 spatial symmetry .",
    "first , unicity of a branch of periodic solutions is based on the fact that @xmath0 is abelian , and we recall the abelian hopf theorem in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the periodic solution predicted by the equivariant hopf theorem @xcite with the symmetry of the unique isotropy subgroup with a two - dimensional fixed point subspace is the only one .",
    "we begin with recalling results on the normal form for the @xmath39equivariant bifurcation from @xcite on the @xmath74 group , which is isomorphic to @xmath14 this means that we can adapt the theory of @xmath74 to our case , withe merely a re - interpretation of the branches .",
    "we say that the bifurcation problem @xmath75 commutes with @xmath0 if @xmath76      the proof is almost identical to the one for @xmath74 in @xcite but we prefer to give it adapted to the action of the group generators of @xmath14 we write @xmath75 as @xmath81 commutativity with equation implies @xmath82 now @xmath83 transforms @xmath84 into @xmath85 , i.e. @xmath86 and if the action of @xmath87 is @xmath88 then we get that @xmath89 is odd in @xmath47 while @xmath90 is even in @xmath91 when @xmath83 acts as identity and @xmath87 acts as @xmath92 then @xmath89 is even in @xmath50 and @xmath90 is odd in @xmath93 now the rest of the proof is exactly the same as in @xcite .",
    "+   + in the following we will follow again the route and results in @xcite to obtain the jacobian matrix of equation @xmath94 what is more , we can reformulate or adapt to our case lemma @xmath95 ( page @xmath96 in @xcite ) and add the proof again corresponding to our case , which in the cited reference has been left as an exercise for the reader .      *",
    "if @xmath99 is a trivial or a pure mode solution , then @xmath100 in is diagonal and its eigenvalues which are real have the signs listed as follows : * * trivial solution : @xmath101 * * @xmath102mode solution : @xmath103 * * @xmath104mode solution : @xmath105 * if @xmath99 is a mixed mode solution , then * * @xmath106 at @xmath107 * * @xmath108 at @xmath109        accordingly , if @xmath114 equation reduces to @xmath115 in the first case .",
    "moreover , since @xmath116 for the @xmath102mode solution , then @xmath117 and therefore the jacobian matrix becomes @xmath118 similarly , since @xmath119 for the @xmath104mode solution , then @xmath120 and therefore the jacobian matrix becomes @xmath121                  under the conditions in lemma , the stability of the heteroclinic cycle is guaranteed by the fact that it is restricted to the dynamics of system within the fixed point spaces .",
    "we use the criteria of krupa and melbourne @xcite to study the stability of the heteroclinic cycle .",
    "we now recall these stability criteria , which are based on four hypotheses .",
    "+ the first hypothesis guarantees that the heteroclinic cycle is robust .    *",
    "( @xmath126 ) there is an isotropy subgroup @xmath127 with the fixed - point subspace @xmath128 such that @xmath129 and @xmath130 is a sink in @xmath131 + corresponding to each isotropy subgroup @xmath127 in ( @xmath126 ) is the isotypic decomposition @xmath132 of @xmath133 into isotypic components .",
    "let @xmath134 and @xmath135 denote the normalizer of @xmath127 in @xmath136 + * ( @xmath137 ) the eigenspaces corresponding to @xmath138 and @xmath139 lie in the same @xmath140isotypic component ; + * ( @xmath141 ) @xmath142 + * ( @xmath143 ) all transverse eigenvalues of @xmath144 with positive real part lie in the same @xmath140isotypic component .",
    "[ krupa , melbourne ] let @xmath147 be a finite group acting on @xmath133 and @xmath148 be a @xmath68equivariant vector field .",
    "suppose that @xmath149 is a heteroclinic cycle for @xmath150 satisfying hypotheses @xmath151 then generically the stability of @xmath149 is described by precisely one of the following possibilities .    * asymptotically stable ( @xmath152 and @xmath153 for each @xmath154 ) , * unstable but essentially asymptotically stable ( @xmath152 and @xmath155 for each @xmath154 and @xmath156 for some @xmath154 ) , * almost completely unstable ( @xmath157 or @xmath158 for some @xmath154 ) , * completely unstable if @xmath159          the stability is expressed by @xmath162 where @xmath163 in equation , @xmath164 is the expanding eigenvector at the @xmath165th point of the cycle , @xmath166 is the contracting eigenvector and @xmath167 is the tangential eigenvector of the linearization . for the heteroclinic cycle we have @xmath168",
    "so from equation we obtain @xmath169(a-2\\epsilon ) ^2(b-2\\epsilon)}{\\left[b+2(\\epsilon+2q)\\right](a+2\\epsilon ) ^2(b+2\\epsilon)}}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] then the proof follows by applying theorem @xmath170 in @xcite .",
