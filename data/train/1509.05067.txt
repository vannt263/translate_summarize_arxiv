    "recent experimental discovery of three - dimensional ( 3d ) dirac semimetals  @xcite has opened up a new avenue for realizing exotic quantum phenomena such as quantum anomalous hall effect  @xcite , giant diamagnetism  @xcite , oscillating quantum spin hall effect  @xcite , nonlocal quantum oscillation  @xcite and negative or linear quantum magnetoresistance  @xcite .",
    "this novel material is characterized by linear energy band dispersion in the 3d momenta near the dirac point ( i.e. , the touching point between valence and conduction bands ) .",
    "this dirac cone structure has been experimentally observed using arpes measurement in several materials such as na@xmath4bi  @xcite , cd@xmath4as@xmath5  @xcite , taas  @xcite , nbas  @xcite , and tap  @xcite .",
    "if the degeneracy of the dirac cones is lifted by breaking either the time - reversal or inversion symmetry , then there are nontrivial fermi arc surface states  @xcite and unusual transport properties  @xcite in the resultant weyl materials .",
    "( since the theory developed in this paper applies to dirac and weyl materials with the appropriate numerical degeneracy factor correctly incorporated , in this current work we do not distinguish between them and hereafter we will refer to both as 3d dirac materials , systems or semimetals ) .",
    "in addition to transport properties , the thermodynamic property such as electronic compressibility is also of great interest as it provides information about the ground state many - body effects in interacting dirac systems with chiral linear band dispersion .",
    "the interacting electronic compressibility has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally in parabolic-  @xcite and linear - dispersion band materials  @xcite . in particular , the interacting compressibility in 3d metals  @xcite , two - dimensional ( 2d ) semiconductor structures  @xcite , and graphene  @xcite has often been the central quantity in comparing theory and experiment in the study of many - body ground state properties of strongly interacting electron systems .    in this paper , we develop a theory for the finite - temperature compressibility of a 3d dirac material and renormalized quasiparticle velocities of 2d and 3d dirac materials within the single - loop hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) .",
    "we also give the theoretical results for the zero - temperature hartree - fock ( hf ) and random phase approximation ( rpa ) compressibilities in appendices , comparing the two approximations .",
    "we note that although we refer to our theory as the hfa ( the preferred terminology in condensed matter physics ) , the theory is the so - called single - loop field theoretic approximation where the calculation is carried out to the leading order in the coupling constant in a perturbative sense .",
    "the leading - order nature of the single - loop hfa also implies that the temperature - dependence we obtain would be correct to the leading order in the interaction coupling constant .",
    "we emphasize that the hfa is the leading - order perturbative expansion in the bare coulomb interaction , which is known to produce the _ exact _ result for the interacting compressibility to the leading order in the dimensionless coupling constant ( i.e. , the effective fine structure constant for the dirac material ) .",
    "we further remark that for small coupling constant , the compressibilities calculated within the hfa and rpa have _ exactly _ the same leading - order divergent term as discussed in the appendix where we present our rpa results in terms of an expansion in the dynamically screened coulomb interaction .    for a 3d dirac semimetal ,",
    "the effective noninteracting low - energy hamiltonian around a weyl node ( which for our purpose , leaving out any real spin degeneracy , is also a dirac point where the linear conduction and valence bands meet ) is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the noninteracting fermi velocity ( which is assumed to be momentum independent ) , @xmath8 is the momentum and @xmath9 is vector of the pauli operator . throughout this paper",
    ", we set @xmath10 .",
    "the eigenenergies of the hamiltonian are given by @xmath11 with the eigenstates ( for @xmath12 )  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the conduction and valence bands , respectively , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "for undoped or intrinsic dirac semimetal , the chemical potential is zero ( at the weyl node ) while the doped or extrinsic dirac semimetal has finite chemical potential .",
    "the extrinsic case is generic as the chemical potential can be easily shifted away from the weyl node by disorder ( and even for a nominally undoped system , the chemical potential is located typically either in the conduction or the valence band ) .",
    "moreover , the chemical potential can also be adjusted experimentally via surface doping  @xcite . throughout this paper , we focus on extrinsic dirac materials with positive fermi energy ( @xmath18 ) . at zero temperature ,",
    "the noninteracting chemical potential of a 3d dirac semimetal is the same as the fermi energy , i.e. , @xmath19 where the fermi wave vector is given by @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 being the free carrier density and degeneracy factor ( number of distinct valleys , spin , etc . ) , respectively .",
    "the compressibility is defined as the change of volume with pressure @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the compressibility , @xmath25 is the volume , @xmath26 is the pressure , @xmath27 is the particle number , and @xmath28 is the temperature of the system . it can be shown that  @xcite the inverse compressibility ( incompressibility ) is related to the change of chemical potential with respect to carrier density by @xmath29 . in 2d electron gas , the quantity @xmath30 can be obtained experimentally by measuring the quantum capacitance  @xcite or directly measuring the density - dependent chemical potential using a scanning single - electron transistor  @xcite . at zero temperature , the noninteracting incompressibility is simply @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the density of states at the fermi surface of a noninteracting 3d dirac semimetal . for a 3d dirac semimetal , @xmath33 due to the linear energy dispersion while for a parabolic - band 3d electron gas ( 3deg ) , @xmath34 .",
    "interaction among the electrons profoundly affects the compressibility since the chemical potential is renormalized by many - body interaction effects .",
    "in particular , it is known that interaction could drive the electronic compressibility negative in 3d and 2d parabolic - band electron gases ( as elucidated in ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "@xcite , respectively ) whereas in graphene , the prototypical 2d dirac material , electron - electron interaction renormalizes the chemical potential , but does not lead to a negative compressibility  @xcite . in the current work , we address the subject of electron - electron interaction effects on the compressibility of 3d dirac materials . in the usual 3d metals , the electronic temperature scale is @xmath35 k ( where @xmath36 is the fermi temperature with @xmath37 being the boltzmann constant ) , and hence the temperature dependence of many - body renormalization effects is not a particularly relevant topic of research in 3d metals although for lightly doped 3d semiconductors such temperature dependence may become relevant . in 2d systems , however , both for 2d semiconductor structures and graphene , the chemical potential ( i.e. , the 2d carrier density ) can be tuned almost arbitrarily using an external gate voltage , and therefore , temperature - dependent many - body effects take on considerable significance . in the current work ,",
    "we consider interaction effects for both the zero - temperature and finite - temperature compressibilities in 3d dirac materials since the chemical potential can be tuned in 3d dirac systems by extrinsic doping and for low doping , one expects the temperature dependence of the many - body renormalization effect to be significant by virtue of the fermi energy being small . in this work , we assume that the bare electron - electron interaction in the system is the long - range coulomb interaction as appropriate for electrons in standard semiconductors , semimetals , and metals .    the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",

    "we note that the zero - temperature theoretical results are provided in the appendices with the main text focusing on the theoretically challenging finite - temperature results .",
    "we believe that providing both @xmath40 and finite-@xmath28 results in the same paper elucidate different aspects ( e.g. , temperature and density dependence ) of the many - body renormalization effects in dirac materials within one coherent formalism .",
    "in this section , we present the finite - temperature compressibility of 3d dirac materials in the single - loop ( or the leading - order in interaction ) theory , which is equivalent to taking into account the effect of exchange - interaction . more specifically , we focus on the extrinsic or doped dirac semimetal with @xmath18 . the zero - temperature hf compressibility is given in appendix  [ sec : zerot ] .",

    "thus , to the leading - order in @xmath58 , the incompressibility @xmath59 increases quadratically and decreases inverse quadratically with temperature in the limit of low and high temperatures , respectively .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the behavior of noninteracting incompressibility of a parabolic 3deg ( i.e. , normal 3d metals and doped semiconductors ) , where it increases quadratically and linearly with temperature in the limit of low and high temperatures , respectively  @xcite .    within the hfa ,",

    "we note that the hartree part of the self - energy vanishes exactly for the homogeneous system since it is canceled by the positive background charge necessary for neutrality , thus leaving the exchange or the fock self - energy as the only leading - order single - loop term .",
    "the exchange self - energy can be split into the intrinsic self - energy ( @xmath70 ) , which arises from the contribution at zero chemical potential and the extrinsic self - energy ( @xmath71 ) , which takes into account the correction to the self - energy due to nonzero chemical potential :    [ eq : sigmaintext ] @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the difference between the electron occupation number of finite - temperature extrinsic 3d dirac semimetals and the intrinsic @xmath74 case .    since the chemical potential ( consequently , the compressibility ) is only affected by the electron energy at fermi momentum @xmath75 , in the following , we will evaluate the self - energy at @xmath76 .",

    ", @xmath81 should typically be of the order of the inverse of the lattice length scale ( or perhaps even a much smaller momentum scale in the realistic material where the band energy dispersion starts deviating from linearity ) . using the renormalization group ( rg ) theory it is possible to express the interacting compressibility at one density ( i.e. , one @xmath75 value ) simply in terms of that at another density , thus completely eliminating the unknown ultraviolet scale associated with @xmath81 as has been extensively discussed recently in ref .",

    "<S> we calculate , within the single - loop or equivalently the hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) , the finite - temperature interacting compressibility for three - dimensional ( 3d ) dirac materials and renormalized quasiparticle velocities for 3d and two - dimensional ( 2d ) dirac materials . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in the extrinsic ( i.e. , doped ) system , the inverse compressibility ( incompressibility ) and renormalized quasiparticle velocity at @xmath0 show nonmonotonic dependences on temperature . at low temperatures </S>",
    "<S> the incompressibility initially decreases to a shallow minimum with a @xmath1 dependence . </S>",
    "<S> as the temperature increases further , the incompressibility rises to a maximum and beyond that it decreases with increasing temperature . on the other hand , the renormalized quasiparticle velocity at @xmath0 for both 2d and 3d dirac materials first increases with @xmath2 , rises to a maximum , and after reaching the maximum it decreases with increasing temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that within the hfa , the leading - order temperature correction to the low - temperature renormalized extrinsic fermi velocity for both 2d and 3d doped dirac materials is @xmath3 . </S>"
