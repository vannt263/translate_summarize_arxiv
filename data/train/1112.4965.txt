    ". it would be desirable to extend these studies to more general scenarios , particularly to models consisting of more than two electrons , or involving magnetic fields .",
    "the aim of the present contribution is to investigate the entanglement properties of the eigenstates of the exactly soluble moshinsky model @xcite , extending previous works to the cases of a three - electron system and a three - dimensional two - electron system in a uniform external magnetic field .",

    "the entanglement of the two - fermion state is given by the quantum correlations existing on top of these minimum ones .",
    "a practical quantitative measure for the amount of entanglement exhibited by a pure state @xmath0 of a system of @xmath1 identical fermions is ( see @xcite and references therein ) that given ( up to an appropriate multiplicative and additive constant ) by the linear entropy of the single particle reduced density matrix @xmath2 , @xmath3,\\ ] ] notice that , according to this entanglement measure , a pure state that takes the form of a single slater determinant has no entanglement .",
    "the measure ( [ entanglementsl ] ) is normalized to adopt values in the interval @xmath4 $ ] .",

    "these relations imply , in particular , that the wave function @xmath65 ( and also @xmath66 ) must be fully antisymmetric in the three coordinates @xmath67 .",
    "finally , it is clear that in order to be energy eigenstates the states ( [ forabe1]-[forabe2 ] ) must involve spatial wave functions @xmath58 that are themselves eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian ( [ hami ] ) . in particular",

    "the ground state and few excited eigenstates of the three - electron system that we are going to study in the present work do not correspond to the form ( [ forabe2 ] ) .",

    "therefore , it is evident that these three spatial wave functions are eigenfunctions of ( [ hami ] ) sharing the same eigenenergy .",
    "we will use combinations of type if the quantum number @xmath79 is even , and of type when it is odd , ensuring in this way the antisymmetry of the wave function .",

    ". states of the forms ( [ spincombination1 ] ) and ( [ spincombination2 ] ) correspond to a wave function with total spin @xmath80 of the three - electron system but one can also construct eigenstates of the same type with total spin @xmath81 . as the entanglement of the @xmath81 states is the same as the entanglement of states with @xmath82 , in the rest of this work we will mainly focus on states with @xmath82",
    ".    we must remember that these states are written in jacobi relative coordinates of a three - particle system and the quantum numbers @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath79 refer to these coordinates .",
    "however , to determine the amount of entanglement between the particles we have to express the wave functions associated with the eigenstates in terms of the coordinates and spins of the particles , @xmath85 in the case of the eigenfunctions of the moshinsky system the entanglement measure @xmath86 can be computed in an exact analytical way . however , for highly excited states the corresponding expressions become very awkward . therefore , we are going to calculate this quantity only for the ground state and the first and second excited states . in each case",
    "we shall provide the final closed expressions for @xmath86 ( arising from the evaluation of the aforementioned integrals ) and discuss the behavior of the eigenstate s entanglement .",

    "the attractive case ( fig.1 ) entanglement behaves in a different way : maximum entanglement corresponds to the limit @xmath151 .",

    ", entanglement increases both if one increases the strength of the interaction keeping constant the external potential or , alternatively , if the strength of the confining potential is weakened while keeping constant the interaction .",

    "the dependence of entanglement with the magnetic field can now be physically understood .",
    "this dependence follows the same general patterns explained above .",
    "indeed , the basic fact about the magnetic field in the moshinsky model ( which of course is a common external field acting on both particles ) determining its effect upon entanglement is the following : increasing the strength of the magnetic field tends to increase the confining effect of the combined external fields ( that is , the harmonic external field and the magnetic field ) .",

    "the probability density corresponding to the ground state of the particle is , @xmath252 a direct way to study the dependence of the confinement of this particle on the strength of the magnetic field is to compute the entropy of the spatial probability density and determine its behaviour with the magnetic field ( decreasing values of the entropy correspond to increasing confinement ) .",
    "the linear entropy , @xmath253 = 1 - \\int [ \\rho(\\mathbf{r})]^2 d\\mathbf{r}$ ] , and von neumann entropy , @xmath254 = - \\int \\rho(\\mathbf{r } ) \\ln[\\rho(\\mathbf{r } ) ] d\\mathbf{r}$ ] , of the probability density ( [ confinao ] ) are given , respectively , by @xmath255 and @xmath256 $ ] .",
    "the entropies @xmath257 and @xmath258 describing the spatial `` spreading '' of the probability density associated with ground state wave function are plotted against the magnetic field in figure 7 .",
    "it can be clearly appreciated that confinement increases with the intensity of the magnetic field .",
    "the probability densities corresponding to the excited states of this single - particle case , as well as the two - particle spatial probability densities corresponding to the eigenfunctions of the moshinsky system , also become more confined when the magnetic field becomes more intense .",
    "as already explained , this behaviour is consistent with the decrease of entanglement with an increasing magnetic field .",
    "in this section we consider a perturbative approach to the two previously studied models , regarding the term that describe the interaction ( between the three or two electrons ) as a small perturbation ( @xmath260 ) .",
    "let us consider both systems governed by a hamiltonian of the form    @xmath261    where the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath262 takes different forms for each case ( see eqs . ( [ h03e ] ) and ( [ h02e ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath262 corresponds to three independent ( non - interacting ) particles and two independent particles in a magnetic field , respectively , and @xmath263 describes the interaction between the electrons , being @xmath35 a small parameter .",
    "a perturbative treatment of this system involves an expansion of its eigenenergies and eigenstates in terms of powers of @xmath264 .",
    "if this approach is valid we expect the gross properties of the energy spectrum to be given by the eigenvalues of the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "it is clear that within this scenario the leading , zeroeth - order contribution to the energy spectrum is independent of the detailed structure of the perturbation @xmath265 .",
    "however , the situation is different when , instead the energy , we calculate the entanglement of the system s eigenstates .",
    "when the unperturbed energy eigenvalues are degenerate the leading ( zeroeth - order ) contribution to the eigenfunction s entanglement does depend , in general , on the details of the perturbation .",
    "let us consider an @xmath193-fold degenerate energy level of @xmath262 , with an associated set of @xmath193 orthonormal eigenstates @xmath266 . since @xmath262 describes non - interacting particles ,",
    "the @xmath193 eigenstates @xmath267 can always be chosen to be slater determinants written in terms of a family of orthonormal single - particle states @xmath268 in the case of three particles and in terms of @xmath269 in the case of two particles .",
    "so we have for a three - particle system ,    @xmath270 @xmath271 and for a two - particles systems @xmath272    all the members of the subspace @xmath273 spanned by the states @xmath267 are eigenstates of @xmath262 corresponding to the same eigenenergy .",
    "the different members of this subspace have , in general , different amounts of entanglement .",
    "typically , the interaction @xmath265 will lift the degeneracy at least partially of the degenerate energy level .",
    "if we solve the eigenvalue problem corresponding to the ( perturbed ) hamiltonian @xmath209 and take the limit @xmath274 , the perturbation @xmath275 will `` choose ''",
    "one particular basis @xmath276 among the infinite possible basis of @xmath273 .",
    "the states constituting this special basis will in general be entangled .",
    "these states are of the form @xcite",
    "@xmath277    where the @xmath193-dimensional vectors @xmath278 are the eigenvectors of the @xmath279 @xmath280 matrix with elements given by ,    @xmath281    it is then clear that , in the limit @xmath97 the eigenstates of @xmath209 will in general be entangled .",
    "let @xmath282 be the number of different single - particle states within the family @xmath283 or @xmath284 .",
    "@xmath282 tends to increase with @xmath193 which , in turn , tends to increase with energy ; that is , @xmath282 tends to increase as one considers higher excited states .",
    "this explains ( at least in part ) why the range of entanglement values available to the eigenstates @xmath276 tends to increase with energy .",
    "indeed , the amount of entanglement that can be achieved for a given energy of a @xmath1-fermion system admits an upper bound given by    @xmath285      let the unperturbed hamiltonian be ,    @xmath286    and the perturbation ,    @xmath287.\\ ] ]    then , we have @xmath288 . when @xmath289 the model consists of three - independent harmonic oscillators with the same natural frequency .",
    "let @xmath290 ( @xmath291 ) the eigenstate of each of these oscillators .",
    "for the first excited state which is four - fold degenerate , let @xmath292 be the single - particle orthonormal basis .",
    "then , for @xmath289 , we can choose the four eigenstates with zero entanglement , all of them with the same energy as @xmath107 and @xmath106    @xmath293 and @xmath294 .",
    "for the first excited energy level of @xmath262 ( @xmath295 ) , we have    @xmath296    and the corresponding eigenvectors can be written as    latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{eigenvec4prima }            in the decoupled limit the eigenstates @xmath107 and @xmath106 tend to the states ( or any combination of them ) which have @xmath298 .",
    "this value coincides with the amount of entanglement for the first excited state obtained from the exact calculation in the limit @xmath299 ( equivalently @xmath300 ) .",
    "the states @xmath301 and @xmath302 ( @xmath303 and @xmath304 ) share the same energy eigenvalue .",
    "a linear combination of eigenstates sharing the same eigenenergy is also a valid energy eigenstate .",
    "then , let us consider for instance @xmath305 , ( @xmath306 ) .",
    "as already discussed at the end of subsection iii.b , the amount of entanglement of these linear combinations does not depend on @xmath120 .",
    "we have seen that in the case of some excited states of the moshinsky model an arbitrarily weak interaction between the particles leads to a finite amount of entanglement .",
    "this naturally suggests the following issues : to what extent is this weak - interaction entanglement robust ? what happens with this entanglement if some other small perturbation acts upon the system ?",
    "the detailed entanglement features of the eigenstates corresponding to this scenario will evidently depend on the precise form of the new perturbation .",
    "therefore , these entanglement properties can only be studied in a case - by - case way .",
    "however , it is possible to gain some valuable insights on the robustness of the weak - interaction entanglement by recourse to a statistical approach .",
    "we can consider the typical features of the weak - interaction entanglement corresponding to a random perturbation .",
    "let us consider again the four eigenstates ( [ eigenvec4 ] ) of the unperturbed ( with no interaction ) system .",
    "any weak perturbation acting on top of the already considered weak interaction will lead ( in the lowest order of perturbation theory for a degenerate eigenenergy ) to a new set of four perturbed energy eigenstates that will be linear combinations of the four unperturbed states ( [ eigenvec4 ] ) .",
    "that is , the new perturbed states are orthonormal states belonging to the four - dimensional linear space spanned by the states ( [ eigenvec4 ] ) .",
    "we can consider the statistical distribution of entanglement values corresponding to random states in this subspace uniformly distributed according to the haar measure ( see @xcite and references therein ) . to this end",
    "we generate three - electron states randomly distributed according to the haar measure of the form ,    @xmath307    with @xmath308 as given in eq .",
    "( [ eigenvec4 ] ) . a state of the form @xmath309 can be thought as an eigenvector corresponding to an arbitrary perturbation .",

    "( [ gen - ent ] ) we obtain the maximum possible value of entanglement @xmath311 associated to the state with coefficients satisfying : @xmath312 .    in table [ t - pdf ] we show the percentual number of three - electron pure states belonging to the linear subspace spanned by the states ( [ eigenvec4 ] ) that have entanglement values in different ranges . to compute these percentual values we generated @xmath313 random states distributed according to the haar measure .",
    "the average and maximum entanglement values corresponding to perturbed states spanned by ( [ eigenvec4 ] ) are also given in table [ t - pdf ] .",
    "these results constitute suggestive evidence for the robustness of the entanglement exhibited by excited eigenstates of the moshinsky atom in the weak - interaction limit .",
    "indeed , the statistical study summarized in table [ t - pdf ] suggests that any new perturbation is likely to produce a small decrease in the entanglement of the excited state considered here ( @xmath314 ) but , in the typical case , it will still result in an appreciable amount of entanglement in the weak - interaction limit .",

    "these states correspond to a four - fold degenerate unperturbed energy level . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     let us now study the entanglement properties for the second excited state of the moshinsky atom . in this case , we have ten - fold degenerate eigenstates , ( all of them with @xmath315 ) .",
    "the single - particle orthonormal basis is given by @xmath316 .",
    "the matrix of the harmonic perturbation can be expressed as follow :    @xmath317    following a similar procedure and after a laborious algebra we compute the entanglement amount of the eigenvectors of @xmath280 ,    @xmath318    where @xmath319 ( @xmath320 ) are the eigenvectors of the @xmath280 matrix .",
    "the states @xmath321 with @xmath322 share the same eigenvalue .",
    "the same occurs for the state pairs @xmath323 and @xmath324 , and @xmath325 and @xmath326 . as we mention before , the interaction lift only partially the degeneracy .",
    "the degeneracy due to the spin degree of freedom ( @xmath327 ) is present in all the states .",

    "again the obtained results are in perfect accordance with the entanglement obtained for states @xmath362 and @xmath363 in the decoupled regime .",
    "we explored the entanglement properties of two versions of the moshinsky model : one comprising three electrons and another one consisting of two electrons in a uniform external magnetic field .",
    "the amount of entanglement of the eigenstates of the three - electron system considered here depends only on the dimensionless parameter @xmath92 describing the relative strength of the interaction between the particles ( as compared with the strength of the external confining potential ) .",
    "we obtained closed analytical expressions for the amount of entanglement of the ground , first and second excited states .",
    "as a general trend we found that the entanglement exhibited for these states tends to increase both with the state s energy and with the strength of the interaction between the particles ( that is , with @xmath92 ) .",
    "non - vanishing entanglement is obtained in the limit of vanishing interaction in the case of excited states .",
    "this ( apparent ) discontinuous behaviour of the entanglement is related to the degeneracy of the energy levels of the `` unperturbed '' hamiltonian describing non - interacting particles .",
    "the non - vanishing entanglement in the limit of zero interaction is determined by the particular basis of @xmath262 `` chosen '' by the interaction .",
    "we also found that in the case of an attractive interaction the eigenstates entanglement approaches its maximum possible value in the limit of an infinitely large interaction . on the other hand , in the case of a repulsive interaction the maximum possible entanglement",
    "is obtained when the interaction strength approaches a finite , critical limit value corresponding to @xmath155 .",
    "the system does not admit bound eigenstates when the strength of the ( repulsive ) interaction is equal or larger than the one corresponding to @xmath364 .",
    "as far as the entanglement s dependence on the interaction strength and the energy are concerned , the behavior of the moshinsky model with two electrons in a uniform magnetic field is similar to the one observed in the three - electron model . with regards to the external magnetic field",
    ", we found that the eigenstates entanglement decreases when considering increasing magnetic fields . in the limit of very strong magnetic fields",
    "the entanglement approaches a finite asymptotic value that depends on the interaction strength .",
    "the essential aspect of the magnetic field in the moshinsky model that determines its effect upon the amount of entanglement exhibited by the system s eigenstates is the following : increasing the intensity of the magnetic field tends to increase the confining effect of the combined external fields ( that is , the harmonic external field and the magnetic field ) . for a given strength of the interaction between the particles , this increasing confinement leads ( according to a general pattern that has been observed in all atomic models where entanglement was studied in detail ) to a decrease in the eigenstates entanglement .",
    "as happens in the case of the three - electron model , a perturbative treatment highlights the essential role played by the degeneracy of the energy levels of the interactionless system in determining how the eigenstates entanglement depends on the interaction strength and on the energy .",
