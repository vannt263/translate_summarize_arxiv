    "we can in principle slowly increase the size and perturb the skew of the box so as to decrease the packing fraction @xmath0 while remaining at the configuration specific yield stress ; the yield stress should then vanish at a configuration specific @xmath64 .",

    "( [ eg ] ) to write , @xmath70 it then follows that the probability that a configuration @xmath16 at packing fraction @xmath0 will be found to have a pressure @xmath11 is just , @xmath71 next we assume , as in eq .",

    "thus , for @xmath21 we expect @xmath51 to be finite as @xmath59 , but for @xmath34 the pressure distribution diverges algebraically as @xmath59 .",
    "the presence or absence of such a divergence in @xmath51 at small @xmath11 is thus a simple test of whether @xmath34 or @xmath76 .",
    "this conclusion is in complete agreement with the behavior of @xmath51 observed in figs .",
    "[ f1]-[f3 ] if we accept the previously determined values of @xmath3 found for the three different ensembles .",
    "note , the direct numerical determination of the function @xmath77 for individual configurations is somewhat problematic . for statically jammed configurations under isotropic stress , as in rand , slowly varying the packing fraction can on occasion trigger an instability that causes a sudden rearrangement of many particles with an accompanying discontinuous jump in pressure .",
    "this tends to be more of a problem upon compressing rather than decompressing @xcite .",
    "however for decompressing a configuration along its yield stress curve , as in qs , the difficulty is greatly increased .",
    "firstly , the location of the yield stress curve is not apriori known , and so the trajectory in the @xmath78 plane ( with @xmath79 the shear stress ) that one is trying to follow must be determined in some self - consistent way . but",
    "more importantly , a configuration at its yield stress is inherently at the cusp of going unstable .",
    "if during decompression the system parameters are varied in a way that contains any overlap with the unstable direction in phase space , the particles will suffer large rearrangements and the pressure will jump discontinuously . in practice",
    "we have found that it is possible to continuously ( i.e. without large particle rearrangements ) decompress configurations along the yield stress curve only over small intervals of @xmath0 too restrictive to be able to accurately determine the exponent @xmath3 assumed in eq .",
    "( [ egx ] ) .",
    "so instead of directly computing @xmath77 numerically , we take eqs .",
    "( [ eg]-[ep ] ) as an implicit way to determine @xmath77 from the well defined pressure histograms @xmath51 .",
    "we would like to be able to fit the histograms in the above figures , so as to independently determine a numerical value of the exponent @xmath3 in each of the different cases .",
    "however such an analysis is complicated by several factors : ( i ) the range of data for which we see the upturn at small @xmath11 , where the distribution is dominated by the small @xmath11 power law divergence , is exceedingly narrow ; ( ii ) we do not apriori know the form of @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ ep ] ) that we need to do a fitting over a wider range of @xmath11 ; ( iii ) we do not apriori know how the function @xmath80 of eq .",
    "( [ egi ] ) may depart from a pure power law as @xmath11 increases from zero to larger values . as we explain below",
    ", we find that ( i ) and ( ii ) combine to be too severe a problem to allow us to make a meaningful quantitative estimate of @xmath3 from our histogram data .",
    "the simplest and most natural guess for the probability distribution @xmath66 is a gaussian , @xmath81 where we allow that the average @xmath82 and width @xmath83 may depend on @xmath0 .",
    "if we further assume a pure power law form for @xmath77 over the entire range of interest , @xmath84 we can then write @xmath85 ^ 2}\\enspace .",
    "\\label{epp}\\ ] ] within the above gaussian approximation for @xmath66 , we see that a value @xmath34 gives not only a divergence at small @xmath11 , but also an asymmetric peak about the maximum for the exponential term in @xmath51 .",
    "if , however , the true @xmath66 was asymmetric about its peak , this would give another source of asymmetry about the peak of @xmath51 .",
    "in that case , using the symmetric gaussian approximation for @xmath66 and fitting our data to eq .",
    "( [ epp ] ) would result in inaccurate values of @xmath3 .",
    "we find this is in fact the situation .",
    "to see this point , we consider the rand ensemble with harmonic soft - core potential . here",
    ", earlier work @xcite has established the value @xmath21 , and indeed the histograms in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] show no evidence of any divergence at small @xmath11 , as is consistent with @xmath21 .",
    "we therefore fit the data in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] to eq .",
    "( [ epp ] ) fixing @xmath21 .",
    "the results are shown as the solid lines .",
    "we see that even though @xmath21 , the histogram peaks , particularly at the larger values of @xmath0 , show a noticeable asymmetry ; data lies systematically above the fitted curve on the high @xmath11 side of the peak , and below the fitted curve on the low @xmath11 side of the peak .",
    "if we fit this same data to eq .",
    "( [ epp ] ) with @xmath3 as a free fitting parameter , we find values of @xmath86 , varying sensitively with the range of @xmath0 that is considered in the fit , as well as with the range of @xmath11 that is used in the histogram at each particular @xmath0 . the fitted value of @xmath3 thus arises from a competition between the true @xmath3 that determines the limiting small @xmath11 behavior , and an effective @xmath3 that is trying to model an unknown asymmetry about the histogram peak that is not captured by our gaussian approximation for @xmath66 .",
