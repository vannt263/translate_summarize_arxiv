    "<S> a matrix formulation is derived for the calculation of the swimming speed and the power required for swimming of an assembly of rigid spheres immersed in a viscous fluid of infinite extent . </S>",

    "<S> the analysis is based on the stokes mobility matrix of the set of spheres , defined in low reynolds number hydrodynamics . for small amplitude </S>",
    "<S> swimming optimization of the swimming speed at given power leads to an eigenvalue problem . </S>",
    "<S> the method allows straightforward calculation of the swimming performance of structures modeled as assemblies of interacting rigid spheres . </S>"
