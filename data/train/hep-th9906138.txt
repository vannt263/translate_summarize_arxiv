    "is proposed .",
    "we can not claim to give here an absolute derivation of this s - matrix since we are missing a more precise treatment of the zero - mode constraint ( eq .",

    "the proposed scattering description allows an exact computation of the boundary ( impurity ) contribution to the free energy , @xmath5 .",
    "it reveals an infinite series of plateaux at integer values of @xmath6 .",
    "let us first summarize some of the features of the model described in @xcite .",
    "the conformal field theory was defined by the euclidean action [ 2.1 ] s = dt d @xmath7 ^ 2 - _ _ a _ - a_^2 where @xmath8 is the electro - magnetic gauge field . the above theory lives on a cylinder with @xmath9 , and in the folded boundary version which we consider here , @xmath10 .",
    "the lagrangian possesses the gauge symmetry [ 2.2 ] _ cft ( + , a_+ _ ) = _ cft ( , a _ ) where @xmath11 .",
    "the gauge field was taken to be a pure , singular gauge @xmath12 , and the theory was supplemented by the zero mode constraint [ 2.3 ] dx__= dx _ _ when @xmath13 , the parameter @xmath14 was related to the hall conductivity as @xmath15 .",
    "the pure gauge field can be gauged away using [ 2.4 ] _ cft ( + , _ ) = _ cft ( , 0 ) using the zero mode constraint eq .",
    "( [ 2.3 ] ) , this leads us to consider the gauge transformation [ 2.5 ] + from the transformation ( [ 2.5 ] ) on the primary fields of the theory , one finds that the partition function has an @xmath16 invariance acting on the modular parameter @xmath17 .    upon adding a circular defect line of impurities , in the folded theory this corresponds to a boundary term in the action @xmath18 , where the boundary is at @xmath19 . performing the gauge transformation ( [ 2.5 ] )",
    "led to the boundary field theory [ 2.6 ] s = s_bcft + d   @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "the boundary conformal field theory @xmath22 is that of a free scalar field , but with the unusual boundary condition@xcite : [ 2.7 ] _ t - _ = 0 ,   ( t=0 )    the above theory is massless in the bulk , but with a mass / length scale at the boundary . to obtain an s - matrix description of this theory",
    "we follow the ideology described in @xcite .",
    "namely , we imagine turning on an integrable bulk interaction such that the integrability is not destroyed by the boundary interactions .",
    "this selects a special basis of particles in the bulk that diagonalize the boundary interactions .",
    "we then take a massless limit in the bulk .",
    "a bulk interaction that is compatible with the boundary interaction , as far as integrability goes , is @xmath23 , where again @xmath24 .",
    "the reason is , that since @xmath25 , written in terms of @xmath26 , the above theory , without the gauge field , is equivalent to the boundary sine - gordon model , which is known to be integrable@xcite . performing the same gauge transformation eq .",
    "( [ 2.5 ] ) leads us to consider @xmath27 .",
    "next consider the boundary condition eq .",
    "( [ 2.7 ] ) . using @xmath28 , one has @xmath29",
    ". thus the boundary condition can be written as [ 2.8 ] _",
    "t @xmath30 = 0 ,  ( t=0 ) this is a neumann boundary condition for the combination @xmath31 .",
    "all of this leads us to consider the bulk theory [ 2.8b ] s_bulk = dt d@xmath32 where we have defined @xmath33 . when @xmath34 , the boundary version of the above free theory leads to the boundary condition ( [ 2.8 ] ) .",
    "let us now rewrite the theory in terms of @xmath26 . as far as the bulk theory is concerned , we can drop the topological term @xmath35 , since it is identically zero . using @xmath36 , and defining a rescaled field @xmath37 ,",
    "one finds [ duals ] s_bulk = dt d@xmath38 where we have used the left - right decompositions @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and [ 2.10 ] = ,   = ,    when @xmath41 , the above bulk theory is the well - known sinh - gordon model .",
    "consider now the massless limit @xmath42 .",
    "the theory has both left and right moving particles .",
    "for the right - movers we parameterize the energy and momentum by @xmath43 , and for the left movers @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a rapidity and @xmath46 an arbitrary energy scale .",
    "one can describe the theory in terms of an s - matrix @xmath47 for the left - movers and @xmath48 for the right - movers@xcite . from the form of the bulk interaction in eq .",
    "( [ duals ] ) it is clear that @xmath49 is the sinh - gordon s - matrix defined by the sinh - gordon coupling @xmath50 , whereas @xmath51 is defined by @xmath52 .",
    "one argument is the following . in the sine - gordon version",
    ", one can characterize the s - matrices by the non - local quantum affine symmetry@xcite .",
    "this symmetry survives in the massless limit , and the left - moving ( right - moving ) quantum affine symmetry will have @xmath53-deformation parameter defined by @xmath50 @xmath54 . using the known s - matrix for the sinh - gordon model@xcite ,",
    "the result is thus [ 2.13 ] s_ll ( ) = where [ 2.14 ] _",
    "l = = + similarly , @xmath51 is given by eq .",
    "( [ 2.13 ] ) with [ gammar ] _",
    "r = = - = 1- _ l using the invariance of the s - matrix under @xmath55 , one sees that @xmath56 .",
    "we discuss now the @xmath4 properties of the above s - matrix .",
    "as described in @xcite , the bulk conformal field theory has an @xmath4 invariance acting on the modular parameter @xmath57 .",
    "more specifically , the partition function on the torus is invariant under @xmath4 . since @xmath58",
    "provide a scattering description of this conformal field theory , we expect the s - matrix to be at least in part characterized by this symmetry . under @xmath59 ,",
    "one has that @xmath60 where [ z5 ] ^2 = ,    = - note that under this transformation , @xmath61 , which implies @xmath62 .",
    "thus @xmath63 simply exchanges left and right movers : [ sl4 ] - 1/    b_l^2 b_r^2 since @xmath56 , the scattering theory has this invariance .",
    "the other independent generator of @xmath4 corresponds to @xmath64 , which corresponds to @xmath65 .",
    "the s - matrices turn out to only be invariant under a multiple of this transformation .",
    "namely , using the invariance of the s - matrices under @xmath66 , one verifies their invariance under @xmath67 . for the original fermion model considered in @xcite with @xmath68 this corresponds to @xmath69 .",
    "the significance of this is not entirely clear .",
    "we now consider performing the analytic continuation @xmath70 .",
    "there are at least two justifications for doing this .",
    "first , the hall conductivity computed in @xcite is imaginary unless one performs this continuation .",
    "second , in order to formulate the above scattering description one needs to have identified a `` time '' by continuing to minkowski space .",
    "let us analytically continue to minkowski space by identifying @xmath71 as the time ( based on the boundary interaction ) and letting @xmath72 .",
    "the minkowski action @xmath73 is obtained from the euclidean one by @xmath74 .",
    "this leads to the analytic continuation of @xmath75 . to see this ,",
    "let us rescale @xmath76 .",
    "then the euclidean topological term is [ 2.11 ] s^top",
    "i dt d(_t _ - _ _ t ) letting @xmath72 and identifying @xmath73 as above one finds that the minkowski action is obtained by the analytic continuation @xmath75 . performing this continuation in eq .",
    "( [ 2.10 ] ) one finds that @xmath77 , @xmath78 and that the s - matrices now have the parameters : [ gamcon ] _",
    "l = + i ,   _ r = _ l^ *    the resulting s - matrix has the same form as the bulk massive staircase model of zamolodchikov @xcite , where there @xmath79 was taken as @xmath80 . however since we are here dealing with a massless bulk theory , the interpretation is different and in fact our theory does nt suffer from some of the problems of interpretation of the bulk massive staircase model .",
    "namely , since there is no bulk interaction in the massless limit , just a free scalar field , the theory does nt have the reality problems of the massive case arising from complex values of the sinh - gordon coupling @xmath81 .",
    "the above scattering theory is a limiting case of the bulk massive theories studied in @xcite .",
    "finally , the interactions at the boundary are described by a reflection s - matrix @xmath82 for reflection of the above particles off the boundary . in the massless sinh - gordon model , this reflection s - matrix , which can be obtained by taking the explicit massless limit of the boundary sinh - gordon model , is known to be independent of the sinh - gordon coupling @xmath50 .",
    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "the result should be the same in our case and we thus take [ 2.16 ] r ( ) = ( /2 - i/4 ) the physical s - matrix for right movers is @xmath83 , and for left movers @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is defined as a physical boundary energy scale .",
    "we consider now the theory on a semi - infinite cylinder of circumference @xmath86 , where @xmath71 runs along the circumference and @xmath87 and as before @xmath10 . viewing @xmath71 as the time",
    ", the hilbert space lives on the semi - infinite line @xmath10 , and finite size @xmath86 effects can be computed from the `` l - channel '' thermodynamic bethe ansatz@xcite@xcite .",
    "of interest is the boundary entropy @xmath5@xcite , defined as the contribution to the free energy that is independent of the length @xmath88 of the cylinder , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is proportional to @xmath88 .",
    "viewing the theory as a @xmath91 dimensional quantum system , @xmath6 represents the ground state degeneracy , i.e. it counts the number of states at the boundary .    using the formulas in @xcite ,",
    "one has [ 3.1 ] g = _",
    "-^d @xmath92   @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a solution of the integral equation [ 3.2 ] ( ) = e^ - d   @xmath95 @xmath96 in the above equation , @xmath97 is a boundary length scale @xmath98 ; it defines an energy scale at the boundary @xmath99 .",
    "the numerical solution of @xmath6 as a function of @xmath100 is shown for the two values of @xmath101 in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "there are two important features of these figures .",
    "the first is that on the plateaux @xmath6 takes on the series of integers @xmath102 , as anticipated in @xcite .",
    "the second is that the plateaux are more clearly defined as @xmath103 is increased .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the possible implications of our results for the proposal made in @xcite in connection with the quantum hall transitions .",
    "the integer valued plateaux that we found in the boundary state degeneracy is a promising feature .",
    "the meaning of the boundary entropy suggests that as the scale @xmath86 is decreased , the model goes through a series of transitions where at each transition one more state becomes localized at the impurities . in order to verify this picture",
    "one needs to relate the boundary entropy of our 2-dimensional model to the @xmath104 dimensional system .",
    "the significance of @xmath105 , as discussed in @xcite , can not be seen from what we have done in this paper since we have not studied the conductivities @xmath106 . in the conformal field theory",
    "it was argued that @xmath107 implies @xmath13 , @xmath15 .",
    "one needs to study the conductivities in the presence of the boundary interaction . it should be possible to do this using form factors .",
    "since the conductivities are reduced to boundary effects , it seems likely that the transitions in the boundary entropy will entail transitions in the conductivity , but only a detailed analysis will tell .    a related issue which needs clarification concerns whether the scattering theory described here implicitly treats the boundary condition in a way that is consistent with the perturbative treatment in @xcite , which , when @xmath105 , led to the correlation length exponent @xmath108 ."
