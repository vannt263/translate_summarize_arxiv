    "multivariate linear time series models such as the autoregressive moving average ( arma ) processes are fundamental in the theory of econometrics and finance . moreover , time series data where the dimension grows along with the sample size are becoming increasingly frequent . a key model in these situations is the infinite dimensional moving average process of order infinity , @xmath6 , where the sample @xmath7 of size @xmath8 satisfies @xmath9    for all @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are @xmath13-dimensional vectors and @xmath14 are @xmath15 _ coefficient matrices _ and @xmath16 .",
    "precise assumptions of independence , finiteness of moments and conditions on the matrices are discussed later .",
    "we work in the framework of the particular high dimensional model where the dimension @xmath13 increases proportionately with the sample size @xmath8 , so that @xmath17 and @xmath18 . the infinite sum in ( [ eqn : model ] ) exists in the almost sure sense under suitable decay conditions on @xmath19 . if @xmath20",
    ", then it will be called an @xmath21 process . for convenience , we will write @xmath13 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , for @xmath25 and @xmath11 .",
    "many researchers have worked on this model recently .",
    "see , for example , @xcite ( @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one of the key quantities in time series analysis is the autocovariance matrix .",
    "the _ population autocovariance matrices _ are defined as @xmath26 the moment estimator of @xmath27 is the _ sample autocovariance matrix _",
    ", @xmath28 we often write @xmath29 and @xmath1 , respectively , for @xmath27 and @xmath30 . our goal is to study the large sample behaviour of the random matrices @xmath1 and use the asymptotic results for statistical inference purposes such as order determination of infinite dimensional moving average or autoregressive processes .",
    "since we are dealing with several matrices of increasing dimension together , we need to give precise meaning to the large sample behaviour in our context .    the most common way to capture the large sample behaviour of a sequence of random matrices is through its spectral distribution . the empirical spectral distribution ( esd ) of an @xmath31 ( random ) matrix @xmath32 is the ( random ) probability distribution with mass @xmath33 at each of its eigenvalues .",
    "if it converges weakly ( almost surely ) to a ( non - degenerate ) probability distribution , then the latter is called the _ limiting spectral distribution _ ( lsd ) of @xmath32 .",
    "incidentally , the study of the limit spectrum of non - hermitian matrices is extremely difficult and very few results are known for general non - hermitian sequences .",
    "researchers have concentrated on the additive symmetrized version @xmath34 , one at a time .",
    "one widely used approach to establish the lsd is that of stieltjes transformation , which for any finite measure @xmath35 on the real line equals @xmath36 pointwise convergence of stieltjes transforms to a stieltjes transform implies the convergence of the corresponding distributions . in random matrix theory ,",
    "this convergence is proved by linking the stieltjes transform of the esd to the resolvent and showing convergence by martingale convergence methods .",
    "see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and bai and silverstein ( @xcite ) .",
    "all existing works regarding lsd of autocovariance matrices are based on this method .",
    "let us first discuss briefly these results .",
    "consider the simplest case of ( [ eqn : model ] ) where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are i.i.d .",
    "with mean zero and variance one and with enough high moments .",
    "then @xmath39 is nothing but the unadjusted sample variance  covariance matrix , and it is well known that its lsd is the marenko  pastur law .",
    "see , for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for the same model , @xcite showed that the lsd of @xmath40 exist and are equal for every @xmath41 and derived its stieltjes transform .",
    "@xcite and @xcite derived the limiting stieltjes transformation of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , when the components of @xmath44 are independent samples from an identical univariate @xmath21 process .",
    "@xcite appears to be the only work in model ( [ eqn : model ] ) for arbitrary @xmath45 . for each @xmath2 , they established the existence of the lsd of @xmath46 and derived its stieltjes transform as a solution of a pair of functional equations . to derive this result , they assumed that @xmath38 are i.i.d . with finite @xmath47th moment .    their assumptions on @xmath48 are , however , quite restrictive .",
    "they assumed that @xmath48 are hermitian and simultaneously diagonalizable ( the latter assumption can be replaced by the assumption that @xmath48 are toeplitz matrices with suitable decay conditions on their entries ) .",
    "even so , this excludes many interesting linear processes ( such as model @xmath47 in section  [ subsec : example ] ) . to indicate another limitation of this assumption ,",
    "suppose further that @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath50 be a unitary matrix such that @xmath51 ( say ) are diagonal matrices . since @xmath52 and @xmath53 are identically distributed and @xmath54 , as far as the lsd of @xmath55 is concerned , ( [ eqn : model ] ) is equivalent to the model @xmath56 where @xmath57 for every @xmath58 .",
    "hence , this model does not exhibit spatial dependence or dependence among the components .",
    "our approach differs from the existing approaches in many ways .",
    "first , we do away with the hermitian and simultaneously diagonalizable condition and replace it with a more natural and much weaker joint convergence assumption [ assumption ( a3 ) in section  [ sec : main ] ] .",
    "second , all the existing works concentrate on @xmath59 .",
    "if we wish to study the _ singular values _ of @xmath1 , we need to consider the symmetric product @xmath4 .",
    "this gives rise to a completely different lsd problem .",
    "indeed , one may consider more general symmetrizations that involve several @xmath60 . as we may recall , in the one - dimensional case , all tests for white noise are based on quadratic functions of autocovariances .",
    "see , for example , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the analogous objects in our model are quadratic polynomials in autocovariances .",
    "thus , we are naturally led to the consideration of matrix polynomials of autocovariances .",
    "while it is conceivable that the stieltjes transform method can be potentially used to tackle these cases , it seems to be rather cumbersome and needlessly lengthy to do so and shall at best be a case by case study .",
    "we provide a unified method to study the lsd of symmetric polynomials of the autocovariance matrices .",
    "we do not use stieltjes transforms at all except to cross - check our results with the existing results , all of which follow as special cases . to obtain the lsd",
    ", we use the method of moments .",
    "the @xmath61th order moment of the esd of an @xmath31 real symmetric matrix @xmath32 equals @xmath62 .",
    "consider the following conditions :    for every @xmath63 ,    @xmath64 , and    the sequence @xmath65 satisfies carleman s condition , @xmath66 .",
    "if ( m1 ) , ( m4 ) and ( c ) hold , then esd of @xmath32 converges almost surely to the distribution @xmath67 determined uniquely by the moments @xmath68 .",
    "( m1 ) is the most crucial condition in this method as it identifies the moments of the lsd .    in theorem",
    "[ thmm : lsd ] , we claim the existence of the lsd of any symmetric polynomial in @xmath69 in model ( [ eqn : model ] ) and describe the limit in terms of a polynomial of some free variables . to establish ( m1 ) , we use tools from non - commutative free probability theory ( the next section and sections [ sec : main ] , [ subsec : ncpconvergence ] , [ subsec : lsdproof ] and [ subsec : algorithm ] contain the necessary background ) .",
    "free variables in the non - commutative world are the analogue of independent random variables in the commutative world .",
    "as matrices are non - commutative objects , appearance of non - commutative probability spaces is not surprising .",
    "the reason for the appearance of free variables is more subtle ( see the discussion at the beginning of section  [ sec : main ] ) . in section  [ subsec :",
    "example ] , we provide simulation results for specific choices of the model .",
    "these simulations support the conclusion of theorem  [ thmm : lsd ] . based on simulations",
    ", we also conjecture that the lsd exists for the non - hermitian matrices @xmath70 .",
    "it is natural to anticipate that the sample autocovariance matrices will play an increasingly crucial role in the statistical analysis of these models .",
    "this seems to be at a rudimentary stage currently , but we anticipate further thrust as the limiting structure of these matrices is uncovered .",
    "@xcite estimated the spectrum of the coefficient matrices by minimizing some distance between stieltjes transformations of the esd and the lsd of @xmath71 in some appropriately chosen space of distribution functions . in sections [ subsubsec : maarorder ] and [ subsec :",
    "arorder ] , we use the lsd results to provide a graphical method to determine the order of a moving average and an autoregressive process . following a suggestion by one of the referees , in section  [ subsubsec : trace ] , we discuss the asymptotic distribution of the trace of sample autocovariance matrices . as a by - product of the calculations used in the derivation of the lsd results ,",
    "we conclude that these traces have asymptotic normal distributions .",
    "this can be used to test simple null and alternative hypotheses for model ( [ eqn : model ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec : proof ] contains the outline of the proofs .",
    "further details of the proofs are available in the supplementary file @xcite .",
    "to aid the reader , we first highlight the essential notions from free probability that are needed to understand our main theorem .",
    "further concepts and facts , as needed later , are discussed at the beginning of section  [ sec : main ] and in sections [ subsec : ncpconvergence ] , [ subsec : lsdproof ] and [ subsec : algorithm ] .",
    "an excellent reference for all the details is @xcite .",
    "commutative random variables are attached to a probability space @xmath72 , which consists of a @xmath73-field @xmath74 and an expectation operator @xmath75 .",
    "similarly , non - commutative variables are attached to some non - commutative @xmath76-probability space ( ncp ) @xmath77 consisting of a unital @xmath76-algebra @xmath78 and a unital linear functional ( called a state ) @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "thus , @xmath81 is the analogue of the expectation operator .",
    "the elements of @xmath78 are called ( non - commutative random ) variables .",
    "the canonical example of ncp that we will need is @xmath82 , the space of all @xmath83 matrices with the state @xmath81 as the average trace .",
    "if the matrix has random entries , we modify @xmath81 by taking its usual expectation .    in the commutative case ,",
    "random variables ( say with bounded support ) are independent if and only if all joint moments obey the product rule .",
    "it is well known that the cumulants and moments are related via the mbius transformation on the partially ordered set ( poset ) of _ all partitions_. using this , it can be shown that independence is also equivalent to the vanishing of all mixed cumulants .",
    "for a set of non - commutative variables @xmath84 , the set of all joint moments is defined as @xmath85 and is known as the distribution of @xmath86 . here",
    ", we have the notion of joint cumulants , called _",
    "free cumulants_. these can be uniquely obtained from the above moments and vice versa via a different mbius transformation and its inverse on the poset of all _ non - crossing partitions_. non - commutative variables are said to be _ free _",
    "( freely independent ) if and only if all their mixed free cumulants vanish .",
    "a consequence of freeness is that all joint moments of free variables are computable in terms of the moments of the individual variables .",
    "of course , the algorithm for computing moments under freeness is different from ( and more complicated than ) the product rule under usual independence .",
    "the notion of freness of variables extends to freeness of sub - algebras in the natural way .",
    "now consider ncps @xmath87 .",
    "then , analogous to the product space in the commutative case , we can have @xmath88 , the _ free product _ of @xmath89 so that the restriction of @xmath81 on @xmath90 is @xmath91 and @xmath92 are free sub - algebras of @xmath78 .    while matrices are seldom free , there is a large class of matrices that are free in an asymptotic sense ( which is made precise in section  [ subsec : ncpconvergence ] ) as the dimension increases .",
    "for example , if @xmath93 and @xmath94 are @xmath31 independent symmetric matrices with all entries i.i.d . whose all moments are finite , then they are asymptotically free . using such asymptotic freeness",
    ", we shall be able to compute the limits of required traces by using tools from free probability .",
    "this will help us to establish the ( m1 ) condition and in the bargain also provide us with expressions for the limits in terms of free variables .",
    "consider the following assumptions on the driving process @xmath95 and the coefficient matrices @xmath48 :    @xmath38 are independent with @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath98 or , for some sequence @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "@xmath48 are compactly supported and for any polynomial @xmath101 in @xmath102 , @xmath103 exists and is finite .",
    "later we shall relax assumption ( a2 ) .    to see how freeness comes into the picture , and hence how it motivates the statement of our main theorem ,",
    "let us focus on @xmath39 when @xmath104 let @xmath105 be the independent ( i d ) matrix .",
    "for @xmath106 , let @xmath107 be the @xmath31 matrix whose @xmath108th upper diagonal is @xmath109 and @xmath110 otherwise .",
    "note that @xmath111 . for @xmath112 ,",
    "let @xmath113 be the transpose of @xmath114 .",
    "note that @xmath115 by lemma @xmath116 of the supplementary file @xcite , @xmath117 and @xmath118 have identical lsd .",
    "thus , our primary goal is to show that for all @xmath119 , @xmath120 exists . to achieve this , we first define an ncp generated by these matrices",
    "however , the matrices @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 are all of different orders .",
    "therefore , we embed these matrices into larger square matrices of order @xmath124 .",
    "we embed @xmath121 into a wigner variance @xmath109 entries on and above the diagonal . ]",
    "matrix @xmath125 of order @xmath124 .",
    "thus , @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are two independent wigner matrices of order @xmath13 and @xmath8 respectively and also independent of @xmath121 and whose entries satisfy assumption ( a2 ) . for any matrices @xmath129 and @xmath130 of order @xmath13 and @xmath8 , respectively , let @xmath131 and @xmath132 of order @xmath124 be the matrices @xmath133 note that for any integer @xmath134 , if the right - hand side limits below exist , then @xmath135 on the other hand , @xmath136 thus , @xmath137 involves polynomials in these matrices .",
    "so it is a question of computing the limiting trace of such polynomials .",
    "now observe that for any monomial @xmath138 :    @xmath139 exists and can be computed easily .    under assumption ( a3 ) ,",
    "@xmath140 exists .",
    "moreover , from random matrix theory it is well known that    if ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) hold then @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is a standard semi - circle variable with moments @xmath143    finally , results from free probability guarantee that _ in the limit _ , the matrices @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 are free variables say @xmath147 and @xmath148 where @xmath149 in some ncp @xmath150 .    thus , using the above conclusions ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) in conjunction with equations  ( [ eq : upperbar ] ) , ( [ eq : lowerbar ] ) , ( [ eq : deltabar ] ) and ( [ eqn : smoments ] ) , we can conclude that @xmath151 exists and @xmath152 the factor @xmath153 within @xmath81 is the adjustment needed for the replacement of @xmath154 by @xmath155 .",
    "the right - hand side of the above equation , involving free variables , are then the moments of the lsd of @xmath156 .",
    "this is the idea we implement in the general @xmath21 process and for general symmetric polynomials of the autocovariances .",
