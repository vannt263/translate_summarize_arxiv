    "we see that @xmath191 is far away from the weak - coupling limit consistent with the results in  @xcite . furthermore , the coefficients with small @xmath102 could be accidentally small .",
    "this suggests that the conclusions in  @xcite possibly result from being far away from the weak - coupling limit and not looking at a sufficient number of fourier modes .",
    "in addition , we can also conclude that we can not use a single - site model with heavy wilson fermions and obtain the continuum limit of a pure gauge theory in contrast to the claims made in  @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues of wilson fermions are doubly degenerate  @xcite but they do not come in pairs of opposite chirality .",
    "therefore , it is not apriori clear how to deal with half a flavor of wilson fermions making it essentially impossible to study the continuum limit of any infinite - volume theory using adjoint wilson fermions on a single - site lattice .    since we can not keep the bare mass finite and non - zero as we take the weak - coupling limit , the proposal in  @xcite to use single - site models with massive adjoint fermions in order to extract physics of pure gauge theories is ruled out .",
    "the allowed regions plotted in fig  [ fig : allowed ] provide for an interesting scenario when it comes to the usefulness of single - site theories to describe correct infinite - volume continuum physics .",
    "we can not study theories with @xmath193 unless we entertain the possibility that the continuum limit occurs away from @xmath185 but this would be a radical deviation from conventional wisdom . we can study @xmath194 theories without a fermion mass .",
    "it is possible we can study @xmath194 theories with a fermion mass provided we can stay in the correct phase by taking the bare mass to zero as we go to the weak - coupling limit such that the physical mass is kept constant .",
    "since this theory is expected to be conformal for massless fermions , it is not clear how a single - site theory will exhibit conformal behavior .",
    "this is certainly a case worth further investigation .",
