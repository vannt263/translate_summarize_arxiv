    "o and b stars are not distributed at random in the sky , but instead are usually concentrated in loose co - moving groups that @xcite first referred to as ob associations .",
    "ob associations are generally distributed along spiral arms , and confined in the galactic plane .",
    "they have low stellar densities of order 0.1  m@xmath2  pc@xmath3 , and are easily disrupted by galactic tidal forces @xcite so must be relatively young with ages @xmath4  myr ( see , e.g. , reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "some of the best evidence that the formation of massive stars can induce the formation of other low- to high - mass stars have been found in ob associations . on scales up to a few tens of parsecs , massive stars can ionize the surfaces of small molecular clouds ( globules ) in their vicinity @xcite ; the pressure from such ionization fronts can then propagate through the globule to help overcome the magnetic , turbulent , and thermal pressure that supports it against collapse , thereby inducing star formation .",
    "this process of radiation - driven implosion has been invoked to trigger star formation in many globules within ob associations @xcite , not least by one of us in the orion region @xcite and lac ob1 @xcite . on the other hand , star - forming globules in ob associations",
    "may simply be dense cores that have spontaneously collapsed to form stars , and were then uncovered by advancing ionization fronts from nearby massive stars . in the examples described in @xcite and @xcite , classical t  tauri stars ( cttss ) are found only between ob stars and bright - rimmed ( i.e. , ionized surface of ) molecular clouds , not within these clouds ; furthermore , those cttss closer to the bright - rimmed clouds are progressively younger , arguing for a genuine sequence in star formation .    on larger scales of tens of parsecs or more , expanding superbubbles driven by ionizing radiation and stellar winds from massive stars , together perhaps with supernova explosions ,",
    "have been invoked to both sweep up and compress gas , and subsequently induce star formation ( see , e.g. , review by * ? ? ?",
    "such large - scale triggerings of star formation may be required to explain co - moving ob subgroups with either identical ages or arranged in an apparent age sequence , with at least some subgroups having an age spread that is much smaller than their stellar crossing time .",
    "one of the best such examples is the scorpius - centaurus ( scocen ) ob association ( see , e.g. , review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is the closest ob association to the sun .",
    "it comprises the three co - moving subgroups upper scorpius ( usco ) with an age of @xmath55  myr , upper centaurus - lupus ( ucl ) with an age of @xmath517  myr , and lower centaurus - crux ( lcc ) with an age of @xmath516  myr distributed from approximately east to west in galactic longitude over a spatial extent of @xmath5130  pc @xcite .",
    "the age dispersion in the usco subgroup ( the youngest ob subgroup ) is no more than @xmath512  myr , compared with a stellar crossing time of @xmath520  myr @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite proposed that subsequent supernova explosions in lcc induced star formation in the molecular cloud that formed usco .",
    "the abovementioned picture of triggered star formation is based on an updated variation of the collect - and - collapse model of @xcite , where a propagating disturbance first collects gas into dense clouds and subsequently induces star formation . here",
    "we present our study of the perseus  ob1 ( per  ob1 ) association , which as shall show has properties that can be most naturally explained by the cloud - shuffling model of triggered star formation as first proposed by @xcite .",
    "cloud shuffling takes place on the periphery of an ob association where a superbubble pushes and accelerates a giant molecular cloud outwards , triggering star formation at the dense cloud interface @xcite . until now , cepheus  ob3 ( cep  ob3 ) has been regarded as one of the best examples where star formation has been triggered by cloud shuffling @xcite .",
    "cep  ob3 contains two ob subgroups , the younger ( @xmath54  myr ) of which is closer to and has a radial velocity resembling the cep  b molecular cloud , and the older ( @xmath5 8  myr ) further away and has a radial velocity resembling the rest of the cloud . @xcite and",
    "@xcite proposed that ionizing radiation and stellar winds from the older ob subgroup pushed and accelerated the cep  b cloud away , as well as induced star formation in this cloud to form the younger subgroup .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we collect together previous studies that compile the proposed members of per  ob1 , and describe our study of the proper motion of those members included in the _ hipparcos _ catalog ; we also describe our search for low to intermediate - mass pre - main - sequence stars towards per  ob1 , and our identification of possible remnant molecular clouds in this association . in ",

    "4 we briefly summarize the most important results of our study and their chief implications .",
    "the per  ob1 association , located in the region of the perseus spiral arm , is commonly ( but not without argument ) thought to be centered about the @xmath0 and @xmath1  per double cluster ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",

    "both clusters have been studied extensively over the last century ( see references in * ? ? ?",
    "the latest study by @xcite conclude that the two clusters have essentially identical ages of @xmath6  myr , distances of @xmath7  kpc , comparable initial masses ( integrating between 1120  m@xmath2 ) of 3700  m@xmath2 for @xmath0  per and 2800  m@xmath2 for @xmath1  per , and a salpeter imf .",
    "although containing more than ten o stars , per  ob1 is not associated with any known regions .",
    "furthermore , unlike virtually all other ob associations studied in molecular gas , per ob1 is not associated with any known giant molecular cloud . @xcite quote a failed attempt to detect molecular gas in unpublished @xmath8co observations by l. a. hillenbrand & j. m. carpenter using the fcrao .",
    "in addition , they find that the reddening to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 per double cluster is indistinguishable and produced entirely by line - of - sight extinction to the perseus spiral arm , with the intracluster reddening essentially zero .",
    "@xcite collected from the literature all the then known early and late - type supergiant stars , o stars , and both main - sequence as well as giant b0b1 stars that were proposed to be members of this association .",
    "she recomputed their photometric distances using the then latest available luminosity calibration for o and b stars , as well as for late - type supergiants .",
    "a total of 105 members were identified , all of which also have comparable radial velocities .",
    "all the member stars lie within the range in galactic longitude of @xmath9 and galactic latitude of @xmath10 .",
    "the most recent compilation from the literature of all proposed early - type luminous members of per ob1 was made by @xcite . by studying where the early - b ( b0b2 ) main - sequence stars lie on the color - magnitude diagram ( i.e. , cluster fitting method ) ,",

    "next to trigonometric parallaxes , this is the most secure method for identifying cluster members .",

    "the relative deficiency in cluster members at low galactic latitudes ( @xmath14 ) appears to be real ; as can be seen in figure  1 of @xcite for per ob1 , many of the early - type stars at @xmath15 were found to be either field stars or members of other associations . on the other hand ,",

    "most of these stars are either early- or late - type giants and supergiants .    in figure  2",
    ", we plot the proper motion of the stars listed in table  [ table : members ] in galactic coordinates .",
    "the blue , green , and red arrows are o , b , and supergiant stars respectively .",
    "the arrows are plotted with lengths proportional to the magnitude of their proper motions : note , however , that the uncertainty in proper motion changes from star to star , and the uncertainty in galactic longitude can be quite different to that in galactic latitude .",
    "we also plot the proper motion of the @xmath0 and @xmath1  per clusters ( black arrows ) as determined by @xcite based on space mission and ground - based observations .",

    "these stars are referred to hereafter as `` field '' stars , although some may be members of other clusters or associations , and yet others perhaps previously unidentified members of per ob1 as we explain below .",
    "the white arrow oriented at a position angle of @xmath24 ( measured anticlockwise from galactic north ) indicates the direction towards the solar apex ; i.e. , the direction ( as projected in the sky ) towards which the sun is moving relative to the local standard of rest .",
    "as can be seen in figure  2 , some of the field stars ( yellow arrows ) have very large proper motions that in many cases lie at position angles of roughly @xmath25 .",
    "these are relatively nearby stars ( as confirmed from an examination of their trigonometric parallaxes ) that , because of our motion relative to the local standard of rest , appear to be moving in a direction opposite to that of the sun ( white arrow in fig .  2 ) .",
    "the proposed members of the per  ob1 association , being much more distant , do now show any such appreciable motion .    to study the actual proper motion of the proposed per ob1 members relative to the galaxy at their ( presumed ) distance ( 2.3  kpc ) and direction , we subtract our motion relative to the local standard of rest and galactic rotation at a distance of 2.3  kpc in the direction of the individual members .",
    "the correction for @xmath0  per is 0.27  mas yr@xmath20 in @xmath17 and @xmath26  mas yr@xmath20 in @xmath18 , giving an actual proper motion of ( @xmath27  mas yr@xmath20 , @xmath28  mas yr@xmath20 ) ; for @xmath1 per , the correction is @xmath29  mas yr@xmath20 in @xmath17 and @xmath26  mas yr@xmath20 in @xmath18 , giving an actual proper motion of ( @xmath30  mas yr@xmath20 , @xmath31  mas yr@xmath20 ) .",
    "thus , the double cluster does not exhibit significant motion relative to the galaxy rotation and galactic plane at its location .",
    "we tabulate the average measured proper motion of the remaining luminous member stars in galactic latitude strips of width @xmath32 from latitudes of @xmath33 to @xmath34 in table  [ table : pm ] .",
    "( note that the measured proper motion of the individual stars is in general of low statistical significance ) .",
    "the average proper motion in longitude is not significantly ( i.e. , @xmath35 ) different from zero except for the two individual stars at the two highest latitudes ( hd  15137 at @xmath36 and hd  14633 at @xmath37 ) .",
    "the average proper motion in latitude is significantly ( at least 4@xmath38 ) different from zero at latitudes @xmath39 , including the two individual stars at the two highest latitudes .",
    "to better visualize the results , in figure  3 we plot the proper motion of the individual members in galactic latitude , as well as their proper motion averaged over the different latitude strips .",
    "apart from the abovmentioned motion away from the galactic plane at @xmath39 , there is also a clear trend towards larger motions away from the galactic plane at higher latitudes , with the star at the highest latitude ( hd  14633 ) exhibiting the largest proper motion away from the galactic plane .",
    "note that the members of per ob1 cataloged by @xcite have in most cases radial velocities in the range @xmath40 to @xmath41 , the same range in radial velocities as the perseus spiral arm .",
    "we therefore conclude that the bulk motion of the stars in per  ob1 is predominantly away from the galactic plane , with velocities up to a few tens of km s@xmath20 for most of the stars with measured proper motions .",
    "a visual inspection of figure  2 reveals that many of the `` field '' stars at latitudes @xmath42 ( yellow arrows ) spanning approximately the same longitude range as the proposed association members also exhibit a preferential motion away from the galactic plane . the average proper motion of the stars in this latitude strip and in the longitude range @xmath43 is ( @xmath44  mas / yr , @xmath45  mas / yr ) .",
    "their average proper motion in galactic latitude is comparable with the values tabulated in table  [ table : members ] for the proposed member stars in this latitude strip , and hence these stars are likely genuine members of per  ob1 .",
    "most of these stars have spectral types in the range b5b9 , and would therefore not have been included in the catalogs of either @xcite or @xcite .        to study whether there has been any recent ( within the last @xmath51  myr or so , compared with an age for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 per double cluster for @xmath5 13  myr ) formation of low- to intermediate - mass stars in per  ob1 , we have searched the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalog @xcite for pre - main - sequence ( pms ) star candidates .",
    "our selection of such candidate stars was based on the empirical criteria developed by @xcite for low - mass cttss and intermediate - mass herbig ae / be ( haebe ) stars , but with improved criteria here for better selecting the latter stars . with this method ,",
    "we first select stars showing near - infrared ( near - ir ) excess thereby preferentially picking out pms stars .",
    "because haebe stars generally exhibit a stronger near - ir excess than ctts , we then separated these two stellar classes based on their 2mass colors as described below .",
    "our initial list comprised all stars in the 2mass catalog at @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( i.e. , spanning a much wider area in the sky than the members of per  ob1 as identified by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that exhibit a near - ir excess .    in figure  4 , we plot the ( j - h ) versus ( h - k ) color diagram for selecting pms star candidates .",
    "ctts candidates are those defined to lie between the two parallel lines @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and above the dereddened ctts locus @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "haebe candidates are defined as those lying between the two parallel lines @xmath49 and @xmath51 , and above the line @xmath52 .",
    "the line @xmath52 helps discriminates classical be stars from haebe stars .",
    "a full explanation for the adopted criteria will be presented elsewhere @xcite . in this way",
    ", we found a total of 399 candidate ctts and 264 candidate haebe stars .    in figure  5 , we plot the spatial distribution of the candidate pms stars ( red for candidate ctts , green for candidate haebe stars , and blue for early - type members of per  ob1 ) . at low galactic latitudes of @xmath53 , apart from three clusters associated with the known hii regions w3 , w4 , and w5 of the cas ob6 association , the candidate pms candidates ( which are presumably confused with cool evolved stars ) are roughly equally distributed in galactic longitude .      in figure  5 ,",
    "we also plot ( in grayscale ) the @xmath54 100-@xmath55 map ( dominated by emission from interstellar dust ) of the per ob1 region .",
    "the map in the right - hand panel has been stretched to accentuate features at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath53 ) coincident with the candidate pms stars selected in the manner described above . as can be seen , around the region occupied by the per ob1 association , a number of the candidate pms stars at galactic latitudes as low as about @xmath56 appear to be close to or coincident with dust clouds .",
    "an examination of optical images from the 2nd digitized sky survey ( dss2 ) as shown in figure  6 reveals bright - rimmed clouds , comet - shaped clouds , and reflection clouds coincident with these dust clouds .",
    "the abovementioned clouds seen in the dss2 images resemble remnant molecular clouds ( rmcs ; ogura et al .",
    "rmcs are small molecular clouds that can be commonly found in the vicinity of ob associations .",
    "their outlines are shaped by ionization fronts from massive stars , and hence they often have cometary morphologies with heads pointing towards the ionizing source .",
    "there is at least one such previously known example in per ob1 , referred to as red nebulous object  6 ( rno6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found two molecular clouds , each having a mass of @xmath5@xmath57 , around rno6 .",
    "they showed that these clouds have cometary morphologies with their heads pointing towards the @xmath0 and @xmath1  per clusters .",
    "they also confirmed that rno6 hosts an embedded ir cluster that includes a hbe star responsible for illuminating rno6 , and suggested that the recent star formation in this rmc was triggered by radiatively driven implosion .",
    "as can be seen in figure  6 , we find another candidate haebe apparently associated with rno6 .",
    "( the known hbe star in rno6 does not exhibit a near - ir excess in 2mass . )",
    "based on figure  5 , we have identified four other candidate rmcs towards per ob1 that appear to be closely associated with candidate pms stars .",
    "( we emphasize that our selection method does not provide a complete census of rmcs in this region . )",
    "they are henceforth referred to as rmc1rmc4 with locations as indicated in figure  5 and tabulated in table  [ table : rmc ] .",
    "a search of the catalog of bright nebulae compiled by @xcite reveals that rmc1 , rmc2 , and rmc3 are associated with lbn  638 , lbn  640 , and lbn  666 respectively .",
    "all four candidate rmcs have cometary morphologies as shown in figure  5 and 6 with heads pointing towards the galactic plane , rather than to any particular o stars in per ob1 .      to determine if there are other sites of recent star formation in per ob1 apart from rno6 , we performed spectroscopic observations of the candidate pms stars close to or coincident with the abovementioned candidate rmcs ( including rno6 ) .",
    "the location of these stars are plotted in figure  6 , and tabulated in table  [ table : spectra ] .",
    "we also observed four stars apparently associated with reflection nebulae located in the vicinity of , and likely associated with , the rmcs .",
    "these stars do not exhibit detectable near - ir excess in 2mass , and hence are not included in our list of candidate pms stars .",
    "the locations of these stars also are shown in figure  7 , and tabulated in table  [ table : spectra ] .",
    "these stars will prove useful in obtaining a distant estimate to the rmcs .",
    "we obtained spectra of both the candidate pms stars and stars associated with reflection nebulae at the beijing astronomical observatory ( bao ) in 2005 and 2006 .",
    "low - dispersion spectra with a dispersion of 200    mm@xmath20 or 4.8    pixel@xmath20 were taken with a 2.16-m optical telescope on 2005 december  68 .",

    "november  1113 , we used the same spectrograph but now deployed with a new princeton instrument spec10 400@xmath581300b ccd detector camera covering the wavelength range 3500 - 8500   .",

    "we separate intermediate - mass stars into haebe , b , and a stars based on the spectral classification scheme of @xcite .",
    "we do not , however , attempt to determine the spectra types of ctts because their spectra exhibit heavy veiling .    of the nine candidate pms stars selected by 2mass colors and observed , we confirmed that four are haebe stars and five are possibly t tauri stars .",
    "detection of the li line , impossible in our low - dispersion spectra , is required to confirm the nature of the ctts candidates .",
    "we find pms stars in the vicinity of or coincident with all four rmcs .",
    "as there are no known foreground ( or background ) star - forming regions in their directions , and given their large heights above the galactic plane ( see more detailed discussion in @xmath60 ) , their association with the rmcs is likely genuine .",
    "the rmcs are therefore likely to be regions of recent or ongoing star formation . of the four stars",
    "( stars 5 , 6 , 8 , and 10 ) associated with reflection nebulae studied , three were found to be b main - sequence stars ( stars 5 , 6 , and 10 ) and one an a main - sequence star ( star 8) .",
    "we now use the b or a stars associated with reflection nebulae to determine a photometric distance to these stars and hence to two of the candidate rmcs .",
    "specifically , we will focus on 2mass j01494099@xmath615341341 ( b7v ; star 5 in table  [ table : spectra ] ) , 2mass j01500456 + 5354007 ( b3v ; star 6 ) and 2mass j01501546@xmath615341350 ( a2v ; star 8) apparently associated with rmc2 , and 2mass j02220484@xmath615038130 ( b8v ; star 10 ) with rmc3 .    to derive the absolute magnitudes in the j - band of stars with the abovementioned spectral classes , we selected eleven b3v , three b7v , forty - one b8v , and 128 a2v stars with good parallax ( @xmath62 ) measurements , [ relative error in parallax of @xmath63 @xcite , goodness - of - fit parameter @xmath64 3 , and percentage of rejected data @xmath65 @xcite ] , and good 2mass photometric qualities . by selecting only stars with small relative errors in parallax ,",
    "we hope to minimize the bias in determining absolute magnitudes and hence distances using this method .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , the inclusion of stars with large relative errors in parallax biases the final result to a lager parallax than the true parallax .    based on measurements of their apparent magnitudes in the 2mass catalog",

    "the corresponding distance modulus of 2mass j01500456 + 5354007 ( b3v ) is 11.324 , 2mass j01494099@xmath615341341 ( b7v ) is 11.831 , and 2mass j01501546@xmath615341350 ( a2v ) is 12.457 ; i.e. , a distance of 1840  pc , 2323  pc , and 3100  pc to rmc2 .",
    "similarly , the distance modulus of 2mass j02220484@xmath615038130 ( b8v ) is 12.327 ; i.e. , a distance of 2920  pc to rmc3 .",
    "all the estimated distance module agree with the range measured by @xcite to per ob1 of magnitude 10.83  12.97 .",
    "the inferred distances to rmc2 and rmc3 are therefore compatible with their location in per  ob1 .    as mentioned above , all four candidate rmcs appear to be associated with pms stars .",
    "if at the distance of the per  ob1 association , then these star - forming regions are located at unprecedented heights above the galactic plane for known clusters embedded in molecular clouds . in figure  8 , we plot the height above the galactic plan of seventy - six such embedded clusters compiled by @xcite within @xmath5 2  kpc of the sun , as well as the four rmcs studied here ( assuming a distance to these rmcs of 2.3  kpc ) . as can be seen , @xmath5@xmath67 of these clusters",

    "all four rmcs studied here are situated more than 280  pc away from galactic plane , with rmc3 having the largest height of @xmath5390  pc .",
    "as mentioned in @xmath68 , per  ob1 is unusual in that it is not associated with a giant molecular cloud .",
    "based on the results described in @xmath69 , we now find that per  ob1 is unusual in at least two other respects .",
    "first , most of its members exhibit a bulk motion away from the galactic plane with those at larger heights moving faster ( on average ) away from the galactic plane .",
    "second , star formation has recently occurred ( and may still be occurring ) at unusually large heights of 280400  pc above the galactic plane .",
    "we now examine whether all of these features can be explained , and if so how , in the framework of current star formation models .",
    "star formation at the present epoch is thought to be relatively inefficient in converting molecular gas to stars , even more so in models that invoke spontaneous as opposed to triggered star formation .",
    "to explain the lack of a giant molecular cloud associated with per  ob1 without invoking an extraordinarily effective dispersement or destruction mechanism , one would have to propose that the star formation in this association has been more efficient than normal in converting molecular gas to stars .",
    "this may , but is not necessarily required to , explain the unusually large stellar densities and masses of the @xmath0 and @xmath1  per double cluster . the high number density of stars and their resultant bipolar outflows , stellar winds , uv ionization , and/or supernova explosions would then be more effective also in sweeping away or destroying much of the remaining molecular gas .    in a search for shells and supershells in the galaxy , @xcite identified a large shell of atomic hydrogen ( ) gas in the direction towards per  ob1 .",
    "@xcite show that this shell occupies the same range in radial velocities as per  ob1 , and forms a quasi - circular structure of size @xmath5@xmath70  pc centered at ( @xmath71)=(134@xmath72.5 , @xmath73.5 ) .",
    "the center of this shell therefore lies quite close to the locations of the @xmath0 and @xmath1  per double cluster .",
    "@xcite estimate a total mass of atomic gas in the shell of order @xmath74 m@xmath2 .",
    "they infer an an upper limit of 10  km s@xmath20 for the expansion velocity of the shell , and a kinetic energy for the shell of @xmath75  ergs .",
    "they also compute a minimum mechanical energy to blow the shell of @xmath76 ergs , compared with an energy released through stellar winds by all the known member b stars of @xmath77  ergs .",
    "thus , stellar winds from b stars alone in per ob1 is sufficient to blow the observed shell , let alone an additional energy from sources such as supernova explosions .",
    "we note that the total kinetic energy of the member stars due to their motion away from the galactic plane ( @xmath78  ergs ) adds insignificantly to the overall energetics .",
    "@xcite show from the _ iras _",
    "100-@xmath79 m image that emission from dust traces the inner border of the shell in the portion at large heights above the galactic plane ( any dust associated with the shell close to the galactic plane is confused with galactic dust ) .",
    "this dust feature can be seen as a nearly semi - circular arc in figure  2 of @xcite , extending to a galactic latitude of about @xmath80 at its largest height above the galactic plane .",
    "we speculate that this dust shell may have formed from the swept - up giant molecular cloud .",
    "we have checked the literature to see if the presumed hot bubble of gas responsible for sweeping up the abovementioned hi and dust shell is visible in x - rays .",
    "such x - ray emission is detectable in the rosat all sky survey ( rass ) @xcite from the orion - eridanus superbubble @xcite , which is powered by ori ob1 ( which contains approximately the same number of o stars as per ob  1 ) .",
    "this superbubble has approximately the same physical size as that enclosed by the hi shell associated with per  ob1 .",
    "the kinematic energy of the orion - eridanus superbubble , as derived from its associated expanding shell , is about @xmath81  ergs @xcite , which is between one and two orders of magnitude larger than that of the presumed per ob1 superbubble .",
    "if the orion - eridanus superbubble was located at the distance of per ob1 , the count rate range of 3/4  kev band would be about 515 counts s@xmath20 . by comparison ,",
    "the background count rate towards the presumed per ob1 superbubble is about 110 counts s@xmath20 .",
    "perhaps not surprisingly then , we did not find any significant x - ray emission from rass in 1/4 , 3/4 , and 1.5  kev bands towards the presumed per ob1 superbubble .",
    "we have searched the literature to find maps in molecular gas towards per ob1 . @xcite has mapped in co(1 - 0 ) the sky in the direction towards per ob1 at an angular resolution of 85 .",
    "compact and isolated co emission is detectable towards rmc1 , rmc2 , and rmc3 , but not towards rmc4 .",
    "if these sources are genuinely associated with the abovementioned remnant molecular clouds , the corresponding molecular gas mass is in these clouds @xmath5 8000  m@xmath2 .",
    "no co emission was detected towards rno6 , which has a molecular gas mass of @xmath5 400  m@xmath2 , consistent with the upper limit in sensitivity of the @xcite map .",
    "no co emission was detected towards the dust/ shell either ; assuming a co linewidth of 10  km s@xmath20 , the corresponding 3@xmath38 upper limit in molecular gas along this shell is @xmath82 m@xmath2 .",
    "if this estimate is accurate , the bulk of the molecular gas in this shell may therefore have been dissociated into atomic hydrogen gas .",
    "much of the star formation in the per ob1 association appears to have occurred in or within the vicinity of the @xmath0 and @xmath1  per double cluster .",
    "if so , then the observed increase ( on average ) in velocity with height ( acceleration ) away from the galactic plane may be a natural consequence of the dissolution of these clusters @xcite . over time , stars moving faster away from the double cluster would travel furthest from their initial locations , thus producing the observed linear increase in velocity with height above the galactic plane .",
    "although this model could explain the velocity pattern of the b main - sequence and supergiant stars , which can have ages up to @xmath5 10  myr of more , it can not easily explain the same velocity pattern observed for the o stars .",
    "the latter stars have ages of only a few millions years , much younger than the b stars in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 per double cluster ( @xmath5 13  myr ) , and could not have reached their present locations if traveling at their observed velocities from these clusters .",
    "this model also predicts that the member stars should form an approximately spherical distribution moving away from the @xmath0 and @xmath1  per double cluster , which is not seen ( c.f .",
    "fig .  2 ) .",
    "given that the molecular gas from which the stars in per  ob1 formed appears to have been effectively swept outwards by the luminous stars in this association ( @xmath83 ) , we now consider whether the observed velocity dependence with height could simply be a reflection of stars forming in this swept - up gas .",
    "the situation envisaged is akin to that proposed in models of triggered star formation , in particular the scenario of cloud shuffling .",
    "cloud shuffling takes place on the periphery of an ob association where an over - pressured superbubble of accumulated stellar winds , supernova explosions , and/or ionized gas pushes and accelerates a giant molecular cloud outwards @xcite .",
    "such cloud shuffling is proposed to induce star formation , and also extend the lifetimes of molecular clouds by pushing them away from massive stars and their destructive effects . in the present case",
    ", the dust shell at the inner boundary of the shell presumably lies just beyond the expansion front of the superbubble associated with per  ob1 .",
    "assuming typical physical conditions in ob associations , @xcite suggests that cloud shuffling can accelerate molecular gas by about 1  km  s@xmath20  myr@xmath20 ( or equivalently 1  pc  myr@xmath84 ) .",
    "let us assume that the @xmath0 and @xmath1  per double cluster was the original source of the superbubble ( with luminous stars formed later from the swept - up molecular gas adding to the energy of this superbubble ) , consistent with its location close to the center of the shell .",
    "the age of this double cluster is estimated to be @xmath513@xmath851  myr @xcite , allowing sufficient time for the molecular gas at the edge of the superbubble to be accelerated by over @xmath86 .",
    "this is the correct order of magnitude to produce , given the uncertainties involved in estimating the magnitude of the acceleration and its possible variation with time , the observed velocity dependence with height of the stars in per  ob1 .",
    "the proposed scenario provides a natural explanation for the relatively large height of hd  15137 above the galactic plane , and its motion .",
    "@xcite suggest that both the massive stars hd  15137 and hd  14633 are runaway stars ejected from the open cluster ngc 654 in the perseus spiral arm .",
    "this suggestion , however , has a serious timescale problem , with inferred flight times for both stars that are longer than their ages @xcite .",
    "if hd  15137 is a member of per  ob1 as proposed in @xmath87 , then in our proposed picture it formed close to its present location and inherited its relatively large velocity away from the galactic plane from its swept - up parent molecular cloud .",
    "note that the o star lying at the next highest galactic latitude , hd  15137 ( location as indicated in fig .",
    "2 ) , has a comparably large proper motion away from the galactic plane .",
    "this explanation , however , can not be simply applied to hd  14633 , which we also proposed in @xmath87 to be a possible member of per  ob1 .",
    "this star is located at a galactic latitude of @xmath88 , which is far beyond the presumed outer edge of the superbubble at a galactic latitude of about @xmath80 .",
    "the triggered formation of stars in the cloud - shuffling model naturally predicts an age gradient from the center of the superbubble , such that stars at larger radii have younger ages . if this model is applicable , the supergiant stars in per  ob1 should therefore be closer to the @xmath0 and @xmath1  per double cluster ( the presumed center of the superbubble ) than the o stars . in figure  9",
    "we plot the spatial distributions of o stars ( dotted lines ) and supergiant stars ( dashed lines ) proposed to be members of per  ob1 from @xcite . using the kolmogorov - smirnov test @xcite",
    ", we find a @xmath89 probability that these two populations have different distributions in galactic height , such that the younger o tend to be located higher above the galactic plane than the older supergiant stars ( the visual impression given in fig .",
    "thus , there does seem to be a tendency , albeit only of marginally significance , for younger stars to be located at larger heights above the galactic plane .      in the cloud shuffling model as applied to per  ob1 , the relatively recent ( within the last @xmath51  myr ) formation of low- to intermediate - mass stars in remnant molecular clouds at unusually large heights above the galactic plane simply reflects the transport of molecular gas to such heights by the expanding superbubble .",
    "the dust and shells described in @xmath83 extend to galactic latitudes of about @xmath80 ( height @xmath5 450  pc above the galactic plane ) , and so the remnant molecular clouds described in @xmath90 lies in projection inside the superbubble .",
    "these clouds may actually comprise swept - up molecular gas located at the periphery of the superbubble .",
    "alternatively , they may comprise the densest condensations in the giant molecular cloud that were not completely swept up by the expanding superbubble .",
    "as mentioned in @xmath91 , all the rmcs have head - tail morphologies with their heads pointing towards the galactic plane rather than in the direction of any particular o star .",
    "these morphologies of these rmcs may therefore have been sculpted by the expanding superbubble rather than ionizing radiation from o stars .",
    "the per  ob1 association comprises the remarkable @xmath0 and @xmath1  per double cluster ( among the brightest and densest open clusters known ) , surrounded by luminous o / b and both early- and late - type supergiant stars . unlike virtually all other known ob associations in the galaxy , there is no known giant molecular cloud in the vicinity of per  ob1 .",
    "we have gathered together the available information on the stellar population of per  ob1 , primarily from the work by @xcite and @xcite . for those luminous early- and late - type stars included in the hipparcos astrometry mission , we have extracted measurements of their proper motions .",
    "we found that :      we also searched for candidate intermediate - mass ( haebe ) and low - mass ( classical t  tauri star ; ctts ) pre - main - sequence stars in per  ob1 .",
    "we find a number of these candidate stars to be associated with four candidate remnant molecular clouds ( rmcs ) identified as dust clouds in _ iras _",
    "100-@xmath79 m images and optical nebulae in the 2nd digitized sky survey .",
    "all these rmcs are located high ( 280400  pc in projection ) above the galactic plane . from our spectroscopy of both candidate pre - main - sequence as well as main - sequence b",
    " a stars apparently associated with these rmcs , we :    1 .",
    "show that the distance moduli to the main - sequence b  a stars are consistent with the rmcs being located in per  ob1 2 .",
    "confirm that some of the candidate pre - main - sequence stars are indeed haebe stars and identify possible cttss , implying that there has been recent ( within the last 1  myr ) star formation at galactic heights far above the locations of known luminous members in per  ob1      1 .",
    "point out that the large shell of atomic hydrogen ( ) gas ( mass @xmath5@xmath92 ) enclosing a slightly smaller shell of dust , studied by @xcite and which they propose to be created by a stellar - wind - blown superbubble from the @xmath0 and @xmath1  per double cluster and ob stars in per ob1 , likely comprises ( in part ) the swept - up remains of the giant molecular cloud from which per  ob1 formed 2",
    ".   argue that if the observed motion of the luminous member stars is attributed to the dissolution of the @xmath0 and @xmath1  per double cluster ( at their outskirts ) , this can only explain the motion of the main - sequence b and late - type supergiant stars .",
    "the main - sequence o stars , which are much younger than the double cluster , would not have had sufficient time to reach their present locations high above the galactic plane if they originated from the close vicinity of the double cluster 3 .",
    "show that the observed motion of the luminous member stars is better explained in the cloud - shuffling model @xcite , in which the abovementioned superbubble pushes and accelerates the giant molecular cloud outwards and at the same time induces star formation at the dense cloud interface .",
    "this would naturally result in those stars forming locally in the compressed molecular gas to have increasingly large velocities away from galactic plane with height 4 .",
    "show that there is a weak trend for the younger o member stars to lie at higher galactic latitudes than the older late - type supergiant member stars , consistent with the simplest prediction of the cloud - shuffling but not cluster dissolution model 5",
    ".   suggest that the recent star formation in the remnant molecular clouds that we found at very large heights above the galactic plane , far above the locations of the luminous member stars , likely occurred in the swept - up molecular gas at the periphery of the superbubble , or in the densest condensations that were not entirely swept away by the expanding superbubble    h .-",
