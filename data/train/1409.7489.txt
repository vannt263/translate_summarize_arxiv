    "kickstarter is a crowdfunding website where a founder proposes a project ( e.g. , smart watch , documentary , video game ) and asks the internet crowd for money .",
    "its use has been growing exponentially : `` the amount pledged on kickstarter alone grew from $ 28 m in 2010 to $ 320 m in 2012 ''  @xcite .",
    "however , not all projects are successfully financed .",
    "one of the most common reasons for failure is that project founders fail to build a community around them and attract investors .",
    "a recent study has indeed found that `` the majority of failed project creators cited the inability to successfully leverage an online audience as a main reason for failing . ''",
    "that is why we set out to propose automatic ways of matching kickstarter founders with twitter investors . in so doing ,",
    "we make the following main contributions :        [ fig : framework ]    * we derive a set of well - grounded hypotheses related to pledging behavior ( section [ sect : framework ] ) .",
    "* we crawl data from kickstarter , including detailed project descriptions and lists of investors , for a period of 3 months ( section [ sect : dataset ] ) .",
    "also , since we need to recommend investors from twitter , we gather all the tweets related to the projects we previously crawled . * upon those two datasets , we test a set of of the hypotheses ( section  [ sect : analysis ] ) .",
    "we find that investors behave differently depending on whether they are frequent or occasional supporters on the site .",
    "as opposed to occasional investors ( 51% of the investor base supported less than 4 projects ) , frequent ones ( 11% supported more than 32 projects ) tend to fund efforts that are well - managed and match their own interests .",
    "by contrast , occasional investors pay less attention to any of those aspects and thus act as donors , mainly on art - related projects . * upon the quantitative analysis , we build a statistical model to recommend potential investors from twitter ( section [ sect : prediction ] ) .",
    "our model achieves 84% of accuracy in predicting an unordered list of investors , and an average percentile - ranking of 0.32 ( i.e. , a 36% gain over the random baseline ) in predicting an ordered list . also , in situations of investor cold start ( no previous information about an investor is available ) , we are still able to predict who funds what with an accuracy of 69% from twitter - derived activity features , and an average percentile - ranking of 0.40 ( 20% gain over the random baseline ) .",
    "we conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of our findings ( section  [ sect : discussion ] ) .",
    "the first crowdfunding site started in 2001 and now there are more than 450 of such sites .",
    "they together have raised $ 2.8 billion and successfully funded more than 1 million projects only in 2012  @xcite .",
    "kickstarter is the largest site in usa . in it ,",
    "a founder proposes a project by posting information about the project s purposes , monetary goals , time left to reach those goals , the way funds will be used , and potential rewards ( e.g. , the founder might offer a signed cd in exchange of a donation ) .",
    "to increase his / her likelihood of success , the founder usually posts videos and pictures to visually explain the project .",
    "( s)he also connects the project s page to dedicated social - networking accounts  @xcite .",
    "as crowdfunding sites have emerged , small entrepreneurs without an access to traditional venture capital s fundings have benefited from this new source of cash flow .",
    "crowdfunding has recently attracted the attention of researchers in various disciplines , from business and economics to computer science .",
    "economists have investigated pleading behavior and they , for example , found that crowdfunding eliminates distance - related economic frictions , yet initial findings tend often to come from family , friends and acquaintances  @xcite .",
    "most of the work by computer scientists has focused , instead , on predicting whether projects will be successfully funded or not .",
    "mollick found that variables under two categories - preparedness ( e.g. , existence of video , spelling check , number of updates ) and social capital ( e.g. , number of the founder s facebook friends ) - are strongly related to the success of a project  @xcite .",
    "_ found that svm could predict , at the time of launch , whether a project will fail or succeed with a roughly 68% accuracy  @xcite .",
    "more recently , based only on the use of language in project descriptions , gilbert _",
    "et al . _ were able to predict failure or success - they indeed found that there are specific phrases that are powerful predictors of success  @xcite .",
    "these phrases are mainly related to six general persuasion principles : 1 ) reciprocity , 2 ) scarcity , 3 ) social proof , 4 ) social identity , 5 ) liking , and 6 ) authority .",
    "after launch , one could also track features that change as the project evolves . in this vein , upon the time series of money pledged and tweets , etter _",
    "et al . _ were able to predict success / failure with an accuracy of 85% at early stages - that is , just after 15% of the entire duration of a campaign has passed  @xcite .",
    "hui _ et al .",
    "_ conducted a throughout qualitative analysis based on 45 interviews and found that the work behind setting up a crowdfunding project unfolds in five main steps : 1 ) prepare ; 2 ) test ; 3 ) publicize ; 4 ) follow through ; and 5 ) contribute .",
    "they then went on recommending which tools computer scientists could build for supporting each of the steps  @xcite .",
    "the most difficult step was identified to be the third one : founders repeatedly failed to build a community and attract potential investors : `` the majority of failed project creators cited the inability to successfully leverage an online audience as a main reason for failing . ''",
    "@xcite + based on this literature review , we might conclude that an automatic way of matching projects with investors is needed . to propose such a way",
    ", we carry out an analysis that unfolds in three steps : derive few hypotheses concerning pledging behavior ; 2 ) collect data from kickstarter and twitter to test those hypotheses ; and 3 ) based on the findings , propose and evaluate models that match projects with potential investors .    [ cols=\"<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "everyday there are on average 39 new projects in kickstarter : not only artists or entrepreneurs are profiting from this new way of raising funds , but also city councils and political organizations have joined the fray .",
    "this is the first study to characterize the pledging behavior of micro - funders .",
    "we have established that investors behave quite differently depending on whether they are very active in the community or not .",
    "frequent investors are attracted by ambitious projects , yet they carefully diversify their investment portfolios .",
    "by contrast , occasional investors act as donors , mainly in art - related projects .",
    "we have also shown that it is possible to match new projects with willing investors , and that is extremely important , not least because the most common reason for failure in kickstarter is the inability of founders to reach out to the right investors .",
    "we are currently working on a website that , on input of a kickstarter project s url , will recommend a list of potential investors twitter accounts .",
    "we will then test the extent to which kickstarter founders find this application useful . as for additional analysis",
    ", we are planning to look at exogenous factors , as this study has focused mainly on endogenous ones .",
