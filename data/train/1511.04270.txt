    "the swimming of many microorganisms is powered by periodic bending motion of cilia and flagella . the flagellar beat results from a feedback : dynein motors generate sliding forces that bend the flagellum ; and bending leads to deformations and stresses , which feed back and regulate motors .",
    "three alternative feedback mechanisms have been proposed : regulation by the sliding forces , regulation by the curvature of the axoneme , and regulation by the normal forces that tend to separate adjacent doublets . in this work",
    "we combine theoretical and experimental techniques to test whether any of these mechanisms can account for the waveforms of the short flagella of the unicellular alga _",
    "chlamydomonas_. we show that the sliding control mechanism can not produce bend propagation for short flagella , which results in a poor fit to the data .",
    "comparison of the waveforms of wild type _",
    "chlamydomonas _ with those of a mutant that has a symmetric beat argues against normal force regulation .",
    "by contrast , the waveforms predicted by the curvature control model accord with the experimental data .",
    "importantly , we make the surprising prediction that the motors respond to the time derivative of curvature , rather than curvature itself , hinting at an adaptive mechanism within the cilium .",
    "cilia and flagella are long , thin organelles whose regular oscillatory bending waves propel cells through fluids and drive fluid flows across the surfaces of cells .",
    "the internal motile structure , the axoneme , contains nine doublet microtubules , a central pair of single microtubules , motor proteins in the axonemal dynein family and a large number of additional structural and regulatory proteins @xcite .",
    "the axonemal dyneins power the beat by generating sliding forces between adjacent doublets .",
    "the sliding is then converted to bending by constraints at the base of the axoneme ( e.g. provided by the basal body ) and/or along the length of the axoneme ( e.g. nexin links ) @xcite .",
    "while the constrained - sliding mechanism of bend formation is well established , it is not known how the activities of the dyneins are coordinated in space and time to produce the periodic beating pattern .",
    "it is thought that the beat is the result of feedback .",
    "the axonemal dyneins generate forces that deform the axoneme ; the deformations , in turn , regulate the dyneins .",
    "because of the geometry of the axoneme , deformation leads to stresses and strains that have components in various directions ( e.g. axial and radial ) .",
    "however , which component ( or components ) regulates the dyneins is not known .    .",
    "the two filaments are constrained to have a spacing @xmath0 .",
    "the dyneins step towards the base of the doublets .",
    "dyneins sitting at the bottom filament with their head ( blue circle ) on the top filament produce a tensile force density @xmath1 on the top filament , which tends to slide it towards the distal end ; and a compressive force density @xmath2 on the bottom filament .",
    "the dyneins sitting on the opposite filament create antagonistic forces .",
    "the local sliding displacement is given by @xmath3 , and the sliding at the base is @xmath4 .",

    ", we isolated _ chlamydomonas _ axonemes , and tracked them with high spatial and temporal resolution . performing a fourier decomposition of the data , we observed that the beat of wild type and _ mbo2 _ mutant axonemes have similar dynamics .",
    "the primary difference lies in the static asymmetry characteristic of the wild type beat , which is lacking in the mutant @xcite . by developing a two - dimensional theory for the axonemal beat in the presence of a static asymmetry ,",
    "we show that sliding control , curvature control , and normal force control can all , in principle , give raise to wave propagation in asymmetric axonemes . however , the observed beats of wild type cells and _ mbo2 _ mutants are not consistent with sliding and normal force control .",
    "by contrast , curvature control accorded with the wild type and _ mbo2 _ beats provided that the curvature signal adapts ( or is insensitive to ) the static component of curvature .",
    "we model the axonemes imaged in our experiments as two opposing inextensible filaments immersed in a fluid ( see fig .  [",

    "the time - averaged shape is calculated from the static force balance @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the zeroth mode of the integrated sliding force @xmath41 . as we will show later , _",
    "chlamydomonas _ axonemes have a static curvature @xmath42 that is approximately constant along the arc length , @xmath43 @xcite . according to the static force balance",
    ", bending the axoneme with a constant curvature requires accumulation of forces at the distal end @xcite .",
    "the static component of the sliding force density is thus @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the dirac delta function , and the minus sign comes from the fact that dynein is a minus end directed motor which has a negative sliding velocity .",
    "see _ appendix _ for details on the sign convention .    to obtain the dynamic motion at the beat frequency ,",
    "we expand the non - linear dynamic equations on the dynamic modes . keeping the linear term we obtain the following equation of motion for the fundamental mode ( @xmath36 ) @xmath46 which has constant coefficients and has to be supplemented by appropriate boundary conditions . here",
    "all quantities have been made dimensionless as indicated in _",
    "there are three dimensionless constants noted with overbars : the dimensionless static curvature @xmath47 ; the normalized friction @xmath48 ; and the normalized frequency @xmath49 , which is sometimes referred to as the `` sperm number '' @xcite .",
    "equation  [ eq : asym ] shows how an oscillatory active sliding force @xmath50 produces dynamic bending of the cilium under appropriate parameter and boundary conditions .",
    "equation [ eq : asym ] is the equation of motion for an asymmetrically beating axoneme .",
    "it generalizes the equation for a symmetric axoneme @xcite , for which the static curvature is @xmath51 and the axial tension @xmath52 . for @xmath53 new terms",
    "appear , and the system of equations is of order six rather than four in the symmetric case . the magnitude of the new terms can be estimated by considering the plane wave limit , in which @xmath54 , with @xmath55 the wavelength .",
    "for example , the fourth term in the right hand side of the equation is of order @xmath56 and is in phase with the first term , that is also present in the symmetric theory and is of order @xmath57 . for _ chlamydomonas _ axonemes @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and since @xmath60 @xcite the ratio of these terms is @xmath61 , thus the new contributions due to the asymmetry can not be neglected .",
    "a similar reasoning shows that the tension term is in anti - phase , and its contribution is of order @xmath62 .",
    "this shows that the additional terms are non - neglibible .",
    "thus , for the large observed asymmetry of the _ chlamydomonas _ axoneme , we expect that in general coupling between the @xmath35 and @xmath36 modes significantly modifies the dynamics of the beating axoneme .",
    "surprisingly , we will later show that this is not the case for beats regulated by curvature .",
    "equation  [ eq : asym ] shows how an oscillating sliding force can produce a dynamic beating pattern .",
    "however , we do not expect the motor proteins themselves to be oscillators that drive axonemal motion at the beat frequency .",
    "rather , we expect that the sliding forces generated by the dyneins are regulated directly or indirectly by the shape of the axoneme through feedback . in this view , the motor force produces a bend , and the bend regulates the motor forces . here",
    "we consider three different types of feedback motor regulation : sliding control , in which motors are regulated by sliding of the filaments @xmath3 ; curvature control , in which they are regulated by the curvature @xmath63 ; and normal force control , in which motors are regulated by the normal force @xmath7 that keeps the filaments spacing at @xmath0 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : axoscheme ] .",
    "the sliding , curvature , and normal force can be decomposed in fourier modes just as the angle @xmath12 .",
    "the fundamental mode of the sliding , @xmath64 , relates to that of the angle , @xmath65 , and the basal sliding , @xmath66 , through eq .",
    "[ eq : sliding ] , which is linear .",
    "thus in sliding and curvature control the feedback is linear . in the case of the normal force control , however , the feedback from shape is non - linear , see _ appendix _ , and the fundamental mode is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the fundamental mode of the integrated sliding force .",
    "this expression vanishes for the symmetric case in which @xmath69 , indicating that in symmetric beats the normal force only has higher harmonics .",
    "thus the asymmetry @xmath53 of the _ chlamydomonas _ cilium opens a way to regulation by normal forces , something impossible in symmetrically beating cilia of which bull sperm is an approximate example @xcite .",
    "the most general expression for the dependence of the sliding force on sliding , curvature and normal force is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a mode - index , and @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are complex frequency dependent coefficients describing the response to sliding , curvature and normal forces , respectively .",
    "these are the generalization to active motors of the familiar linear response of passive systems .",
    "for example , the basal force of the axoneme is given by @xmath75 , and thus the fundamental mode of the basal force is given by @xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "similarly , the coefficients @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 will depend on active motor properties .",
    "equation [ eq : fullmotmod ] expresses how changes in the shape of the axoneme affect the motor force , while eq .",
    "[ eq : asym ] shows how the motor force influences the axonemal shape .",
    "together , they form a dynamical system which can become unstable and produce spontaneous oscillations @xcite . at the critical point",
    "these oscillations are perfectly periodic and we only retain the fundamental mode from eq .",
    "[ eq : fullmotmod ] .",
    "finally , we note that for @xmath35 the response coefficients must vanish , because the observed constant static curvature implies that the static component of the force vanishes all along the length except at the very distal end of the axoneme ( see eq .",

    "[ fig : fits ] to be two orders of magnitude smaller than the observed value .      despite the good fits obtained for wild type and _ mbo2 _ axonemes ,",

    "the first is that unlike the curvature response coefficient @xmath79 , the mean value of the normal - force response coefficient @xmath80 is much greater in mutants cells than in wild type cells ( table [ tab : mbo2fits ] ) .",
    "the reason is that in _ mbo2 _ the small static curvature results in a small normal force , which requires a correspondingly larger response coefficient @xmath80 . in other words , to obtain agreement between the observed and theoretical waveforms , the sensitivity of the motors to normal force needs to be much greater in the _ mbo2 _ mutant than in the wild type .",

    "[ fig : normalasym ] ]    the second argument against the normal force control is that @xmath80 varies greatly from cell to cell for the case of _ mbo2_. this is due to the observation that , while the static curvature is small in _ mbo2 _ axonemes , it is variable .",
    "this leads to a large variability in @xmath154 from axoneme to axoneme , which correlates strongly with the inverse of the static curvature ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : normalasym]a ) , i.e. @xmath155 .",

    "[ fig : tracked]b ( @xmath114 ) and ( @xmath106 ) ) , the response coefficients vary widely in amplitude .",
    "the reason for this correlation between @xmath154 and @xmath42 is that , according to eq .",
    "[ eq : fndyn ] , the dynamic component of the normal force is linearly proportional to the asymmetry @xmath42 .",
    "this means that to preserve a similar fundamental dynamic mode , axonemes with a smaller static asymmetry @xmath42 require motors to have a higher response coefficient @xmath154 .",
    "by contrast , the curvature control response coefficient is highly consistent for wild type and mutant axonemes .    in summary , despite the similarities in the dynamics of the beats of wild type and _ mbo2",
    "_ axonemes , the normal force model requires very different values for the response coefficient @xmath80 ( and also the basal response coefficient @xmath156 ) for wild type and _ mbo2 _ axonemes .",
    "furthermore , the normal force model requires very large differences in @xmath80 from axoneme to axoneme , despite the similarity in the dynamics between axonemes .",

    "the curvature control model provides a good fit to the experimental data for both wild type and _ mbo2 _ axonemes ( figure  [ fig : fits]a and  b , middle panel ) .",

    "while the normal force model provided good fits to the experimental data , it relies on the presence of static asymmetry @xcite , which varies greatly between the _ mbo2 _ and wild type axonemes . as a result of this large difference in static curvature ,",
    "the control parameters in this model had to be varied over a large range to fit the data from the different axonemes , see fig .",
    "[ fig : normalasym ] . because the waveforms of _",
    "mbo2 _ and wild type axonemes have",
    "very similar dynamic characteristics , such variation in the control parameter seems implausible .",
    "finally , the curvature control model provided a good fit to the experimental data with similar parameters for _ mbo2 _ and wild type axonemes .",
    "thus , we conclude that only the two - dimensional curvature - control model is fully consistent with our experimental data .",
    "a potential caveat of the model used here is that it is two - dimensional .",
    "importantly , in order to simplify the geometry , the model only contains one pair of doublet microtubules . in the three - dimensional axoneme",
    ", there are pairs of doublets on opposite sides of the axoneme which , due to the approximate rotational symmetry of the structure , are bent in opposite directions when their associated dyneins are activated .",
    "a key feature of dynein coordination is that motors on either side of the axoneme are antagonistic ( i.e. in a `` tug - of - war '' ) , such that when dyneins on either side are active they bend the axoneme in opposite directions @xcite .",
    "both sliding control and curvature control ensure that the tug - of - war is unstable such that if dyneins on one side begin to dominate , then they completely dominate in a `` winner - takes - all '' scenario .",
    "to capture this idea of reciprocal inhibition by opposing dyneins in the two - dimensional model , dyneins are anchored with opposite orientations to each of the doublets in the pair @xcite .",
    "while this captures the essential features of the sliding control and curvature control models , it oversimplifies the normal force model , because in the three - dimensional axoneme there are radial and transverse forces acting on the doublets as the axoneme bends . yet",
    "the two - dimensional model does not distinguish between them .",
    "to bridge this gap , in other work @xcite we use a full three - dimensional description of the axoneme to calculate the radial and transverse stresses .",
    "the three - dimensional model shows that even when there is a static curvature ( without twist ) , normal ( transverse ) forces are not antagonistic across the centerline and therefore can not serve as a control parameter for motors .",
    "earlier results showed that sliding control can account for the beating patterns of sperm @xcite .",
    "this result is not inconsistent with our results because the bull sperm axoneme is approximately five times longer than the _ chlamydomonas _ axoneme and we have shown that sliding control can work for long axonemes , while for short axonemes it produces no bend propagation , see also @xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible that different control mechanisms operate in different cilia and flagella , with sliding control being used in longer axonemes and curvature control being used in shorter ones .",
    "however we do note that curvature control models can account for the bull sperm data @xcite as well as data from other sperm @xcite , so there is no strong morphological evidence favoring either sliding or curvature control in sperm .",
    "other studies have shown that the normal force model gives beating patterns that resemble those of sperm @xcite .",
    "these models , like ours , rely on there being an asymmetry .",
    "what we have shown is that the control parameter depends critically on this asymmetry while the similarity in the fundamental dynamic modes of _ mbo2 _ and wild type suggests that the parameters should be similar .",
    "thus , the curvature control model , unlike the other two models , robustly describes symmetric and asymmetric beats in short and long axonemes , and could serve as a `` universal '' regulator of flagellar mechanics .",
    "one interesting feature of our curvature control model is that in order to describe the observed beating patterns the motor force depends only on the time derivative of the curvature .",
    "this follows from the fact that the curvature response function @xmath73 has no real part , see tables , and thus vanishes at zero frequency , @xmath182 .",
    "such a model is fundamentally different from the current views of curvature control , in which motors are thought to respond to curvature @xcite and not to its time derivative .",
    "while motors can respond to time derivatives of sliding displacement through their force - velocity relation , it is hard to understand how a similar mechanism could apply to curvature .",
    "a more plausible mechanism giving rise to a response to the time derivative of curvature is an adaptation system analogous to that of sensory systems , like the signaling pathway of bacterial chemotaxis @xcite . in an adaptation mechanism motor activity",
    "would be `` remembered '' , and the average activity over the past times would in turn down - regulate the activity of the motor on a long time - scale .",
    "such regulation could occur , for example , via phosphorylation sites in the dynein regulatory complex or the radial spokes @xcite .",
    "just as methylation of the chemoreceptors of bacteria modifies their ligand affinity , phosphorylation of regulatory elements within the axoneme could modify the motor sensitivity to curvature .    , curvature @xmath63 , normal force @xmath7 and the sliding force @xmath19 for a beating axoneme regulated by curvature .",
    "for a plane wave we have @xmath183 . a time derivative",
    "thus adds a counter - clockwise @xmath184 phase , while a spatial derivative adds @xmath184 clockwise . deviations from this come from the solution deviating from a plane wave due to the boundary conditions . in dashed red",
    "we show machin s prediction for an optimum flagellum .",
    "( * b * ) time evolution of the quantities in a. ( * c * ) beating axoneme with two shapes highlighted during the breast and recovery strokes .",
    "the black arrows represent direction of motion , and the circular arrows represent the local sliding force .",
    "( * d * ) sliding force density over arc length for the two shapes highlighted in c. [ fig : phase ] ]      our dynamic curvature control model adds to the view that dynamic and static components of the beat are regulated independently .",
    "the problem with models in which dynein activity is regulated by the instantaneous value of the curvature @xcite is that both the static and dynamic components of the beat would contribute to regulation and hence the dynamic component of the waveform would be highly dependent on the static component @xcite .",
    "this potential problem was noted by eshel and brokaw in @xcite .",
    "our dynamic curvature control model provides a solution to this problem because static curvature is `` adapted '' away .",
    "we now bring together several lines of evidence supporting the notion that the static and dynamic modes are separable in their origin and in their affect on the beat    1 .",
    "the waveform of _ chlamydomonas _ can be mathematically decomposed into a bending wave superimposed on a static asymmetry ( a circular arc ) , see @xcite .",
    "dynamic and static components of the beat can exist independently of each other .",
    "this is evidenced by the existence of bent non - motile cilia at low atp concentrations on the one hand , as well as symmetrically beating mutants on the other @xcite .",
    "3 .   the waveform of _",

    "fig : tracked ] a @xmath186 and b @xmath186 .",
    "the same also holds for the two beating modes of the uniflagellar mutant @xcite .",
    "thus , altering the static mode of _ chlamydomonas _ has little effect on the dynamic mode .",
    "the dynamic motor response coefficients are largely independent of the asymmetry , and very similar for _ mbo2 _ and wild type axonemes , see fig .  [ fig : sensitivity ] a.    if the dynamic and static modes are indeed independently controlled , the dynamic motor response is robust to changes in the asymmetry .",
    "this has important biological implications : power generation ( the beat ) and steering ( the asymmetry ) can be independently controlled so that the swimming direction can be adjusted without having to alter the motor properties .",

    ", an arc length derivative adds a delay of @xmath184 , which is why the curvature lags almost one quarter behind the sliding .",
    "the motor force is itself delayed one quarter of a cycle with respect to curvature , which makes it in anti - phase with the sliding . finally , since @xmath188 , from eq .",

    "if the value for the real or imaginary parts of @xmath156 were negative , corresponding to an active base , the solution was discarded .",

    "<S> axonemal dyneins are the molecular motors responsible for the beating of cilia and flagella . </S>",
    "<S> these motors generate sliding forces between adjacent microtubule doublets within the axoneme , the motile cytoskeletal structure inside the flagellum . </S>",
    "<S> to create regular , oscillatory beating patterns , the activities of the axonemal dyneins must be coordinated both spatially and temporally . </S>",
    "<S> it is thought that coordination is mediated by stresses or strains that build up within the moving axoneme , but it is not known which components of stress or strain are involved , nor how they feed back on the dyneins . to answer this question </S>",
    "<S> , we used isolated , reactivate axonemes of the unicellular alga _ </S>",
    "<S> chlamydomonas _ as a model system . </S>",
    "<S> we derived a theory for beat regulation in a two - dimensional model of the axoneme . </S>",
    "<S> we then tested the theory by measuring the beat waveforms of wild type axonemes , which have asymmetric beats , and mutant axonemes , in which the beat is nearly symmetric , using high - precision spatial and temporal imaging . </S>",
    "<S> we found that regulation by sliding forces fails to account for the measured beat , due to the short lengths of _ chlamydomonas _ cilia . </S>",
    "<S> we found that regulation by normal forces ( which tend to separate adjacent doublets ) can not satisfactorily account for the symmetric waveforms of the _ mbo2 _ mutants . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the model s failure to produce reciprocal inhibition across the axes of the symmetrically beating axonemes . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that regulation by curvature accords with the measurements . </S>",
    "<S> unexpectedly , we found that the phase of the curvature feedback indicates that the dyneins are regulated by the dynamic ( i.e. time - varying ) component of axonemal curvature , but not by the static one . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that a high - pass filtered curvature signal is a good candidate for the signal that feeds back to coordinate motor activity in the axoneme . </S>"
