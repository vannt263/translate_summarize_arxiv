    "the faraday effect ( fe ) describes the rotation of the plane of linearly polarized light when it passes through a ferromagnet with magnetization component parallel to the light vector .",
    "it is caused by the difference of phase shifts of transmitted light in the two circular polarization states .",
    "the inverse faraday effect ( ife ) is the ability of circularly polarized light to exert torques on a magnetization , which can be interpreted in terms of an effective light - induced magnetic field along its wave vector with the magnitude proportional to the light intensity and the sign governed by its helicity .",
    "in contrast to other photomagnetic effects neither fe nor ife involve absorption of photons , which makes them potentially very fast and therefore interesting _",
    "e.g_. for data storage technologies .",
    "ife was initially predicted by pitaevskii@xcite and formulated in terms of the dependence of the free energy on a time - dependent electric field .",
    "after observation of ife by van der ziel _ _ et al.__@xcite , pershan _ et al_.@xcite developed a microscopic theory explaining ife in terms of an optically - induced splitting of degenerate spin levels , followed by thermal relaxation .",
    "they predicted that magnetization @xmath0 was created by the circularly polarized light propagating in the @xmath1 direction with the intensity @xmath2 of the right ( left ) handed circularly polarized light component . here",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the verdet constant , the wavelength and the speed of the light , respectively .",
    "kimel _ et al .",
    "_ demonstrated ife in @xmath6 by exciting magnetization dynamics with circularly polarized laser pulses on fs time scales.@xcite these and subsequent experiments as reviewed in ref . are not fully explained by the theory presented by pershan _",
    "et al_.@xcite , because thermal relaxation does not occur at such short time scales .",
    "subsequently , stanciu _ _ et al.__@xcite demonstrated that the perpendicular magnetization of gdfeco thin films can be switched on subpicosecond time scale .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite modeled the switching process by multiscale calculations of the magnetization dynamics @xcite with effective magnetic fields of the order of @xmath7 .",
    "however , the microscopic origin , magnitude and material dependence of these fields remain unexplained .",
    "the reciprocity between fe and ife is not universally observed,@xcite and was found by theory to break down in the presence of absorption.@xcite taguchi _",
    "calculated the effect of terahertz electromagnetic radiation on disordered metals with soi.@xcite they found a light - induced magnetization , but at the cost of light absorption .",
    "this is in contrast to the ife phenomenology .",
    "recently , strong effective magnetic fields were calculated for magnetic semiconductors that are caused by the spin - selective dynamical stark effect.@xcite    ife has also been studied in classical plasmas , where it can be explained in terms of the rsted magnetic fields generated by light - induced circulating dc charge currents.@xcite hertel investigated this process for solid state electron plasmas.@xcite he derived the eddy currents and associated magnetic fields generated by time - dependent circularly polarized light in a conducting metal film modeled as a collisionless electron gas . both currents and the related magnetic fields are dissipationless and scale to second order in the electric field amplitude of the circularly polarized light , in line with the microscopic theories for ife . however , the effects is too small to explain the light - induced magnetization switching .",
    "yoshino discussed dissipative corrections to hertel s",
    "theory.@xcite    here , we pursue the concept that ife is caused by light - induced dc currents , but invoke the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) to explain the large effective fields apparently at work .",
    "this perspective of ife is motivated by the linear current driven intrinsic spin torque in ferromagnets predicted by manchon and zhang,@xcite who demonstrated that current in the presence of soi of the rashba type produces an effective magnetic field which is perpendicular to both an inversion symmetry - breaking electric field and the current .",
    "the non - dissipative currents discussed above can be interpreted as a reactive response to a light field , or as a ground state property of the system in the presence of the light field , quite analogous to persistent currents or diamagnetic response to magnetic field that can be formulated as ground states in the presence of a vector potential.@xcite the quantum - mechanical ground state nature of the light - induced current in a @xmath8 ring has been investigated by kibis.@xcite a possible route to a theory of ife would be extending the kibis approach to hamiltonians with spin - orbit interactions . rather than focusing on the quantum mechanics of the generation of charge currents by the light field , we concentrate here on the generation of effective magnetic fields in the presence of circulating charge currents , while using the hertel s approach to estimate the magnitude of these currents for a given light intensity .",
    "this is allowed in the high frequency limit in which the length scale associated with the direct response is much smaller than the geometric confinement or the spin - orbit precession length .    in order to establish the principle we focus here on a non - magnetic system with spin - orbit interaction and in the presence of electron current bias that is generated by circularly polarized light . for a magnetic sample ,",
    "such polarization can exert spin - orbit torques on magnetization .",
    "we focus on a simple yet realistic model system in which the spin - orbit interaction hamiltonian is well known and analytical results can be achieved , _",
    "viz_. a one - dimensional ( 1d / single transverse mode ) ring fabricated from a high - mobility two - dimensional electron / hole gas ( 2deg/2dhg ) with rashba and dresselhaus soi interactions .",
    "soi in a 2deg that is linear in the wave vector is known to be quite anomalous , causing _",
    "e.g. _ vanishing spin hall effect by impurity scattering.@xcite here we find that light - induced effective fields in 1d rings with linear rashba or dresselhaus soi also vanish , which can be traced to the state independence of the equilibrium spin texture .",
    "the holes of a 2dhg close to the valence band edge can also be described by rashba and dresselhaus soi interactions , but with a cubic dependence on the wave vectors.@xcite a quantum ring containing a hole gas has an out - of - plane state - dependent spin texture that indeed generates the current - induced spin polarization . in a ferromagnet",
    "these would indeed induce torques on a magnetization , thereby confirming our working hypothesis .",
    "the remainder of the article is organized as follows .",
    "we solve the problem of a ground state in the presence of a given charge current by the method of lagrange multipliers as explained in section [ meth ] . in section [ nosoi ] , we apply this method to a simple case of rings in the absence of soi , and discuss the difference of the ground state current induced by lagrangian multiplier and the one induced by the magnetic field in a ring . in section [ ring ] , we discuss different models of soi in more detail . in sections",

    "thus , by further increasing @xmath174 , the overall polarization saturates and even slightly decreases .",
    "the jumps reflect level crossings with increasing @xmath199 in these calculations the number of electrons is kept constant ( the fermi energy oscillates ) . at such a discontinuity",
    "an electron vacates a high angular momentum state in favor of a smaller one , which reduces the total spin polarization . in the regime of small soi",

    "the current bias can be generated by the lagrange multiplier method inspired by current - density functional theory . for electrons moving in quantum rings in the presence of the rashba and the dresselhaus sois , the effect vanishes .",
    "it becomes non - zero only when the kramers degeneracy is broken by an exchange potential or applied magnetic field , but the effects are still small.@xcite on the other hand , holes in a ring with cubic dresselhaus and rashba soi display spin polarization under current bias .",
    "this polarization is a competition between two effects . on one hand , with increasing soi the band splitting increases , which amplifies the magnitude of the polarization .",
    "simultaneously , however , the @xmath175-component of the spin of electrons with energies near to the fermi level decreases , and therefore the net polarization decreases .",
    "these two might enhance the effect rather than cancel each other when the spin texture would push the spin out of the plane .",
