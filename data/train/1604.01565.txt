    "friction between sliding surfaces is a common phenomenon which plays an important role in everyday life . like all transport properties , however , friction is ultimately the result of microscopic interactions between particles .",
    "recent years have witnessed a surge of interest in understanding the microscopic origin of friction , due to the increased control in surface preparation and the development of nanoscale experimental methods such as quartz crystal microbalance  @xcite and friction force microscopy  @xcite .",
    "a considerable amount of this effort is being directed towards reducing friction .",
    "one way to reduce friction is through incommensurability , i.e. structural incompatibility between the sliding surfaces on the atomic level .",
    "this effect , often called structural superlubricity  @xcite , has been observed experimentally in nanoscale contacts , for example in graphite  @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of incommensurate sliding contacts often employ the frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model  @xcite or extensions ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "crucially , the fk model does not assume that the sliding objects are rigid .",
    "this allows it to describe deformations of the lattice , which can destroy the vanishing static friction  @xcite for sufficiently soft materials .",
    "the fk model can also describe phonons and heat in the lattices , which absorb the kinetic energy of the sliding@xcite .",
    "consequently , the fk model is the simplest model in which dynamic friction is emergent , while in other models some form of heuristic damping must be included .",
    "while the fk model has been studied extensively in one dimension ( 1d ) , its two - dimensional ( 2d ) extensions have not received as much attention . in 2d ,",
    "both halves of the contact have at least two independent parameters describing the lattice , which considerably complicates the concept of commensurability  ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "two - dimensional surfaces also have 2d phonon dispersion and at least two independent elastic constants .",
    "recently there have been a number of studies dealing with the fk model in 2d that use several different 2d extensions .",
    "several works ( see for example  @xcite ) consider a scalar harmonic interaction , which we will see here can cause serious problems with the dynamic friction .",
    "other works use 2d springs for the interaction , but only include interactions between nearest neighbors ( see for example  @xcite ) . for square lattices , this gives rise to an unphysically vanishing shear modulus , and , as we will see here , unphysical friction .",
    "another group that has mostly investigated scalar harmonic fk models  @xcite later also considered 2d next - nearest neighbor interactions  @xcite , but , opposite to what one would expect , did not find any contribution to the dynamic friction from the dynamics inside the chain .",
    "static friction of 2d sheets of colloids has also been studied in e.g. models consisting of particles interacting with a yukawa potential  @xcite instead of fk models .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the impact of the functional forms of the different fk models in 2d and the values of their parameters on the static and dynamic friction have not yet been systematically compared and evaluated .    here",
    "we investigate the impact of the second dimension on the frictional properties in the fk model .",
    "we consider the two most straightforwards extensions to 2d and determine what is needed for describing the friction in a physical way , in both the static and dynamic case .",
    "we demonstrate how the second dimension affects the static and dynamic friction , and obtain several qualitatively new effects in terms of the temperature dependence of the friction coefficient and non - trivial anisotropy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : models ] introduces the basic features of the fk model , along with definitions and motivations of the 2d models and their parameters .",
    "section  [ sec : statics ] describes the static frictional properties . in sec .",
    "[ sec : equilibration ] we investigate thermal equilibration within the models , in relation to sliding friction . section  [ sec : viscous ] deals with the dynamic friction and the resulting effective viscous friction .",

    "[ sec:2d ] we show several new effects that occur in 2d .",
    "lastly , the conclusions are summarized in sec .",

    "we first briefly discuss the 1d fk model  @xcite which has already been studied extensively  @xcite .",
    "it consists of @xmath0 particles of mass @xmath1 in an ordered harmonic chain with equilibrium spacing @xmath2 and spring constant @xmath3 .",
    "the particles interact also with an external sinusoidal substrate potential of periodicity @xmath4 and amplitude @xmath5 .",
    "the basic setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fk1d ] ( a ) .",
    "often , the effects of inertia are neglected , and this is referred to as the static fk model .",
    "inclusion of kinetic energy instead results in what is known as the dynamic fk model .",

    ". a rational ( irrational ) value of @xmath6 defines a commensurate ( incommensurate ) structure . as discussed in sect.[sec : models]d , for computational reasons , we use periodic boundary conditions that fix the mean interatomic distance at the unstretched length of the spring .",
    "therefore @xmath6 becomes equivalent to the ratio of the two length scales @xmath7 .",
    "we focus only on the incommensurate case which is both more likely for arbitrary surfaces in contact and more interesting in the context of structural lubricity .",
    "the coupling parameter @xmath8 describes the relative strength of the two interaction types .",
    "when @xmath9 is below a critical value @xmath10 ( which depends on @xmath11 ) the incommensurate 1d fk model is in a floating state with zero static friction . for values",
    "@xmath12 however , the system enters a pinned state with finite static friction .",
    "this transition by breaking of analyticity is known as the aubry transition  @xcite .",
    "the parameter can in real systems vary strongly , but we focus here in particular on a value below the transition .",
    "the experimentally observed vanishing static friction of graphene flakes on graphite@xcite strongly suggests that covalently bonded materials physisorbed on substrates are in this regime .",
    "we use @xmath13 , i.e.  the golden mean ( which is the optimally incommensurate ratio  @xcite ) @xmath14",
    "@xcite , and employ the reduced units @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which yields the units of time @xmath18 and energy @xmath19 .    in the dynamic 1d fk model ,",
    "an effective friction arises as a result of the hamiltonian dynamics  @xcite , as primarily caused by resonances between the sliding induced vibrations and phonon modes in the chain . for a uniform sliding of all the particles with velocity @xmath20 over the potential ,",
    "a vibration with the washboard frequency @xmath21 is induced .",
    "the periodicity of the potential corresponds to a wavenumber of @xmath22 for phonons in the chain .",
    "resonances will therefore occur when the washboard frequency matches the phonon dispersion relation of the lattice @xmath23 for @xmath24 or its harmonics @xmath25 , i.e. for the velocities @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the order of the resonance .",
    "when the chain slides with a velocity at or near a resonance , the washboard frequency can parametrically excite acoustic phonon modes .",
    "the energy will then dissipate from these modes also into other phonon modes  @xcite , leading to friction and ultimately thermal equilibrium  @xcite . at zero temperature , this will be preceded by an initial recurrence  @xcite , whereby a fraction of the total energy is transformed back and forth between internal degrees of freedom and the center of mass ( cm ) translation . at nonzero temperature ,",
    "the thermal fluctuations speed up the decay which becomes viscous from the beginning .",
    "the effective friction coefficient , however , depends on the velocity non - trivially , due to the interplay of resonances and thermal fluctuations .      for the 2d models we consider the simplest possible lattice , namely a square symmetry for both the elastic material and the substrate potential .",
    "this gives the straightforward generalizations of the hamiltonian @xmath28~ ,   \\\\",

    "the internal potential energy of the sheet of particles is given by @xmath32 .",
    "we also define the cm velocity as : @xmath33 the variables @xmath29 describe the microscopic internal degrees of freedom , while @xmath34 is reserved for the macroscopic sliding .",
    "several different options have been previously considered for @xmath32 , e.g.  simple harmonic types  @xcite and multidimensional springs  @xcite .",
    "we evaluate these alternatives by considering two representative but qualitatively different interaction types , hereafter dubbed the scalar and vector model , which are schematically illustrated in fig .  [ fig : fk2d ] ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the scalar model describes the two coordinate components as independent scalars with interaction energy terms for each particle @xmath35 @xmath36\\nonumber \\\\ & \\null + \\frac{k_\\mathrm{shear}}{2 } \\big [ ( x_{j , l+1}-x_{j , l})^2 + ( y_{j+1,l}-y_{j , l})^2   \\big]~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 measures the restoring force for transverse displacements within a subchain .",
    "importantly , for the scalar model the @xmath38 and @xmath39 coordinates of the particles decouple completely .",
    "as will be seen later , this has undesirable consequences for the dynamics and can lead to unphysical behaviour .",
    "the vector model conversely describes the vector nature of the particle displacements via fully 2d springs .",
    "we include the interaction between second nearest neighbors as described here by the internal interaction @xmath40 \\nonumber \\\\   & \\null+ \\xi \\frac{k}{2 } \\big [ ( | \\vec{r}_{j+1,l+1 } - \\vec{r}_{j , l}| - \\sqrt{2 } a_0)^2   \\nonumber \\\\",

    ", it is instructive to consider the effective elastic constants @xmath42 ( longitudinal stretching ) and @xmath43 ( transverse shearing ) of the lattices . for the scalar case one obtains trivially @xmath44 whereas taylor expansion to first order of the vector model yields @xmath45 .",
    "the 2d elastic properties of the models are therefore expected to be most alike if the ratios are equated @xmath46 both models preserve the elastic properties of the 1d model in their longitudinal stretching , while the shearing can be tuned independently .",
    "the latter point has particular consequences for the vector model : the case @xmath47 yields a zero shear modulus with strong effects on the friction as shown later , whereas @xmath48 results in a model of two such intertwined but independent lattices .    to estimate realistic values for the two parameters one can consider for example the properties of solidified rare gases often employed as the elastic material in quartz crystal microbalance studies of friction  @xcite , e.g.  xenon  @xcite : @xmath49 and krypton  @xcite : @xmath50 , i.e. @xmath51 .",
    "however , since such measurements are performed on three - dimensional ( 3d ) crystals one needs in the vector model to account for the higher number of next - nearest neighbors in 3d .",
    "the correct expression for comparison therefore becomes @xmath52 , which gives @xmath53 and @xmath54 as our estimation of representative values .",
    "the friction of the 1d fk model , and the associated resonances in particular , depends strongly on the phonon dispersion relation of the elastic lattice .    the phonon dispersion in 1d , calculated in textbook examples  @xcite , is readily extended to the scalar model due to the decoupled equations of motion .",

    "[ fig : equilibration](b ) and  ( c ) .",
    "this exposes clearly the previously mentioned flaw of the model : the scalar nature of the internal interaction causes a complete decoupling in the equations of motion between the @xmath38 and @xmath39 components , resulting effectively in two independent 1d models .",
    "there is therefore no equilibration between the different components and the kinetic energy from a velocity increment in the @xmath38 direction never dissipates into vibrations in the @xmath39 direction .",
    "moreover , because these simulations start from the ground state , each independent subchain has the same initial conditions .",
    "therefore , the energy is only redistributed over @xmath93 independent degrees of freedom , not @xmath94 . as a results ,",
    "the temperature of the mb distribution is approximately a factor of @xmath95 too high .",
    "while the symmetry between the subchains can be broken by initial conditions , such as an initial temperature , the decoupling between @xmath38 and @xmath39 is inherent in the dynamics .",
    "for this reason , the scalar model is clearly not suitable as a fully 2d extension for the dynamic fk model .    the vector model , conversely , is well behaved for physical parameter values ( @xmath96 ) . for both @xmath38 and @xmath39 components the cm velocity obeys the mb distribution corresponding to the correct temperature .",
    "only for @xmath47 with zero temperature the system does not equilibrate properly .",
    "this is due to the symmetry of the initial conditions , which is preserved by the symmetry of the dynamics . as a result",
    ", the nonlinear terms never become relevant . at finite temperature , this symmetry is broken and equilibration is restored .",
    "in many cases for the vector model , however , we find that while the temperatures do converge , this convergence is very slow . in order to obtain enough statistics and satisfactorily confirm equilibration , we were sometimes forced to resort to computationally cheaper smaller systems and simulate for much longer times .",
    "it thus appears that all the vector model systems ( with @xmath97 ) do equilibrate eventually , but that the process can be very slow .",
    "we also note that equilibration was obtained for the vector model with the surprisingly small size @xmath98 ( on 21 periods of the potential ) . for the scalar model and 1d fk",
    ", @xmath99 is too small for dissipation : there is no decay of the velocity as the system never leaves the initial recurrence .",
    "thus , we can also conclude that the nonlinear coupling in the vector model not only provides equilibration between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , but also helps equilibration in small systems .",
    "we have not investigated the system - size dependence systematically , but note that in the vector model with our parameters , for @xmath100 ( on 8 periods of the potential ) , the initial recurrence survives for an extremely long time ( @xmath101 ) even at resonant velocities .",

    "we can thus extract an effective viscous friction coefficient @xmath106 by fitting of an exponential function to the decay curve in a similar way as in the 1d case  @xcite .    in the results presented below , we fit both the coefficient in the exponent and the prefactor of the exponential function to the average decay curve of at least 100 trajectories ( 300 for the 1d system ) obtained from different initial conditions ( generated by differently seeded thermostats ) .",

    "however the effect is smaller , i.e.  peak @xmath139 remains more narrow than in the 1d model .",

    "we note that the values we find for the viscous friction coefficients are significantly lower than those typically found in experiments , which would be around @xmath140 .",
    "however , we observe that the temperature - dependence changes dramatically with the dimensionality and that the friction increases with dimensionality overall , due to the increase in the number of degrees of freedom which energy can be dissipated into .",
    "thus , we expect that the viscous friction in a 3d model would be substantially larger than it is in our 2d systems .      for a 2d model , just as in real systems , the sliding is not necessarily restricted to a specific direction . at the atomic scale , the 2d friction force needs not be the same in all directions ( see for example  @xcite ) and it can even have components perpendicular to the sliding direction ( see for example @xcite ) . in this section",
