    "in the very active field of coherent quantum control understanding the mechanisms of decoherence constitutes a major goal .",
    "a two - level system or quantum bit is the most elementary entity whose coherence is studied .",
    "this small quantum system with two - dimensional hilbert space can be described as spin @xmath0 .",
    "the environment causing decoherence may be built from various degrees of freedom . in this study",
    ", we focus on a bath of spins .",
    "this commonly considered model bears the name central spin model ( csm ) or gaudin model in honor of gaudin who introduced it in the 1970s as one of the rare cases of integrable quantum many - body models @xcite . aside from this attractive theoretical aspect of the csm",
    ", it indeed describes a multitude of relevant experimental setups .",
    "an important example is the electronic spin in a quantum dot where the spin bath is formed by the nuclear spins of the semiconductor substrate , for instance , gaas @xcite .",
    "but , also the effective two - level description of the energy levels in a nitrogen vacancy center in diamond coupled to surrounding @xmath1c nuclear spins @xcite can be based on the csm .    for its relevance in describing experimental data",
    "the csm has been also the subject of a multitude of theoretical investigations of which we can hardly provide an exhaustive list .",
    "persisting spin polarizations occur in the classical version of the csm @xcite or in approaches based on the systematically controlled approximations of master equations @xcite .",
    "many tools have been developed in the last years comprising coupled cluster approaches @xcite and equations of motion @xcite as well as diagrammatic approaches @xcite .",
    "heavy numerical approaches are able to simulate baths of about 20 spins @xmath0 for long times @xcite by chebyshev expansion or up to 1000 spins for limited times @xcite .",
    "the existing analytically exact solution via bethe ansatz can also be used @xcite , but its complexity rises very quickly if experimentally relevant quantities shall be studied so that only stochastic evaluations are feasible for bath sizes of up to 48 spins @xcite .",
    "the caveat of all numerical approaches to the dynamics in the csm and all approximate analytical approaches is that they can not make statements , which are _ a priori _ reliable , about very large spin baths _ and _ very long times .",
    "only _ a posteriori _ one may verify whether the results are reasonable or not . in principle",
    ", analytic results such as general master equations are not hampered by constraints in time or system size .",
    "but , to our knowledge no such approach can be evaluated exactly .",
    "generically , an expansion or approximation related to a small parameter is involved such as the ratio @xmath2 of the exchange couplings @xmath3 over the magnetic field @xmath4 applied externally to the central spin or over some internal polarization @xcite . hence , for small or even vanishing magnetic fields no systematically controlled statements are possible . yet , this region is experimentally relevant in spin noise measurements @xcite .",
    "thus , it is very useful to dispose of rigorous results , either to directly interpret experimental data or to gauge the accuracy of the approximate methods . in spite of the long standing history of the csm",
    "it was only recently noticed that the generalized mazur inequality rigorously shows that persisting correlations are a generic feature of the csm if the distribution of couplings is normalizable @xcite .",
    "interestingly , however , the physically relevant case of a central electronic spin with hyperfine couplings to a bath of nuclear spins can not be normalized because an infinite number of bath spins couples to the central spin , though most of them only very weakly @xcite .",
    "in addition , the temporal fluctuations in the csm around the long - time limit and their evolution has been subject of recent rigorous estimates in ref .   where the issue of persisting correlations has not been treated .",
    "the goal of this study is three - fold .",
    "first , we present rigorous bounds for very large baths and show that they extrapolate reliably to infinite bath sizes if this limit can be based on a normalizable distribution of hyperfine couplings .",
    "second , we improve the bounds obtained previously @xcite . in zero magnetic field ,",
    "the bounds are not yet tight .",
    "third , we extend the rigorous approach to finite magnetic fields applied to the central spin . thereby , we enlarge the applicability of the rigorous approach . by comparison to numerical data",
    ", we illustrate that the rigorous bounds are tight in finite magnetic fields .",

    "a central spin interacts with a bath of @xmath5 surrounding spins .",
    "one may think of the central spin to be an electronic spin , the spins of the bath to be nuclear spins , and their coupling to be the relativistic hyperfine coupling .",
    "we focus here on the isotropic case with the hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath3 denotes the respective coupling constant of the @xmath7th bath spin . for simplicity , we consider here only @xmath0 bath spins . but this restriction can be relaxed .",

    ", we try to maximize this bound to make it as tight as possible .",
    "thus , we consider as many constants of motions as is possible in practice .",
    "two interesting aspects arise : ( i ) which constants of motion contribute significantly to the bound @xmath59 and which do not ; ( ii ) which constants of motion contribute _ independently _ and which are linearly dependent or close to this .",
    "to judge how tight our bounds are we compare them to numerical data from chebyshev polynomial expansions @xcite and to data from stochastic evaluation of the bethe ansatz formulas @xcite .",
    "indeed , the model is bethe ansatz solvable so that every exact eigenstate can be fully defined in terms of a small set of bethe roots whose number is , at most , equal to the system size @xmath5 . finding eigenstates in a numerically exact way",
    "then boils down to finding particular solutions to a system of @xmath5 coupled quadratic equations @xcite , a task which can be rapidly carried out for any single arbitrary target state .",
    "this allows one to use a simple metropolis sampling algorithm in order to approximate the observable - specific spectrum , whose numerical fourier transform gives us back the time - evolved expectation value @xmath60 .",

    "this large number of constants of motion exists thanks to the integrability of the system @xcite . as we will see below the bounds are good , but not tight .",
    "thus , we also use a mathematically less rigorous route which is based on the separation of times scales for large baths . instead of the correlation of the central spin",
    "one considers the correlations of the overhauser field given by @xmath65 assuming the central spin precesses very rapidly around the overhauser field relative to the motion of the overhauser field itself one can approximate the long - time average of the central spin @xcite according to    @xmath66    where we used the conservation of the hamiltonian @xmath67 in the second step .",

    "[ fig : x=1234 ] ]    it can be easily seen that results for up to @xmath79 bath spins are sufficient for a reliable extrapolation to an infinite spin bath @xmath81 for the spin - spin and for the field - field bounds .",

    "our findings presented in fig .",

    "we decided for a linear fit because of the rather small set of data points and their relative scatter .",
    "it can be easily seen that the rigorous bounds for the spin - spin correlation do not exhaust the full persisting correlations .",
    "the estimate using the field - field correlation works remarkably well and might even become exact . but this can not be decided yet for lack of accuracy .",

    "finally , we derive results for the limit of large baths @xmath115 .      in order to apply the method presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : method ] , one needs to know vector and matrix elements which are scalar products of two operators @xmath116 and @xmath117 being sums of products of spin operators .",

    "we therefore conclude that lower bounds using constants of motion with an _ even _ number of summed spin operators stay finite for @xmath145 while constants of motion with an _ odd _ number of summed spins yield lower bounds which vanish for large @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , we stress that a relevant conserved quantity needs to be a vector component in order to have a non - vanishing overlap with @xmath126 .",
    "this can be achieved by multiplying scalar quantities with a vector component , e.g. , @xmath146 with @xmath147 as already done in ref .  .",

    "the calculation of the analytical expressions for matrix elements by hand becomes more and more tedious for increasing number of spin operators .",

    "in addition , the magnetic field applied to the central spin may occur .",
