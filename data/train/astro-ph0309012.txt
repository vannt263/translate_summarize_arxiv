    "our current belief is that the hosts of powerful radio sources in the distant universe are destined to become the giant ellipticals of today , the most massive galaxies we know ( e.g. lilly & longair 1984 , mclure et al . 1999 ) .",
    "they inhabit rich environments that are believed to be galaxy clusters in the process of formation ( e.g. pentericci et al . 2000 , venemans et al .",
    "while some distant powerful radio sources may have commenced their formation at very high redshift , the process of assembly is very active at @xmath02 - 3 .",
    "this corresponds to the epoch when luminous quasars appear to have had their maximum space density and the star formation rate of the universe was two orders of magnitude higher than at present ( e.g. pei 1995 , shaver et al .",
    "1996 , fan 2001 ) .",
    "our group has recently proved that solar or supersolar metallicities are common in the extended gas ( tens of kpc ) of radio galaxies at @xmath02.5 ( vernet et al .",
    "2001 , villar - martn et al .",
    "the relatively high metallicities imply that star formation in these objects has been rapid and intense , enabling a fast chemical enrichment of the gas .",
    "since stellar population analysis of giant ellipticals at low redshift indicates that most stars have been formed during a brief epoch with high star formation rate , this further supports the idea that powerful high redshift radio galaxies are progenitors of the giant ellipticals of today .",
    "star formation is also suggested by the detection at submm wavelengths of some high redshift radio galaxies ( e.g. archibald et al .",
    "2001 , reuland et al .",
    "although the nature of the heating mechanism is controversial , some authors have argued that the dust is heated by starbursts , rather than the hidden quasar nuclei ( e.g. tadhunter et al .",
    "2002 ) . by looking at high redshift radio galaxies",
    "( @xmath132 - 3 , hereafter hzrg ) we are therefore likely to be witnessing the formation process of giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "hzrg are surrounded by giant nebulae which often extend for more than one hundred kpc ( e.g. mccarthy et al .",
    "1990a , reuland et al .",
    "2003b ) and sometimes beyond the radio structures",
    "( e.g. eales et al . 1993 , kurk et al .",
    "2001 , maxfield et al .",
    "one of the great difficulties in the interpretation of the optical and near infrared data of hzrg is due to the fact that the observed morphological , kinematic and ionization properties are strongly influenced by the nuclear activity and the extreme phenomena associated with the relativistic jets .",
    "most morphological and kinematic studies of hzrg have been focussed on the high surface brightness regions .",
    "these are clumpy , irregular ( with features such as filaments , plumes , ionization cones , e.g. reuland et al .",
    "2003b ) and often aligned with the radio axis ( chambers , miley & van breugel 1987 , mccarthy et al .",
    "they are characterized by extreme kinematics , with measured fwhm and velocity shifts @xmath141000 km s@xmath2 ( e.g. mccarthy , baum & spinrad 1996 , villar - martn , binette & fosbury 1999 ) , compared to values of a few hundred in low redshift radio galaxies ( e.g. tadhunter , fosbury & quinn 1989 , baum , heckman & van breugel 1990 ) .",
    "it is likely that a perturbing mechanism such as shocks induced during jet / gas interactions @xcite is responsible for such extreme kinematics .",
    "however , there is evidence in two hzrg for giant ( distance to the nucleus @xmath15 50 kpc=0.7 , @xmath16=0.3 , h@xmath17=65 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 ] ) low surface brightness halos ( lsbhs hereafter ) of ionized gas with _ quiet kinematics _ :",

    "2002 , vm02 hereafter ) .",
    "these quiescent halos might be residual gas from which the galaxy started to form ( vm02 ) .",
    "they offer opportunities to study the ionizing photon luminosity of the quasar and with sufficient line measurements the chemical composition of the halo gas .",
    "if the gas kinematics is gravitational in origin the halos can be used as mass tracers of radio galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "they would provide critical information to constrain models of galaxy formation and evolution . also , the metallicities of the giant halos will set tight constraints on their chemical enrichment history and , ultimately , on the formation process of the galaxy .",
    "we present in this paper the results of a research project whose goal is to search for kinematically unperturbed halos in hzrg and study their kinematic and ionization properties .",
    "an important advantage of the current set of data is that we can use heii ( and civ in some cases ) to constrain the kinematic properties of the gas , rather than using only ly@xmath4 , which is very sensitive to dust / gas absorption .",

    "the spectra for all the objects ( see table 1 ) except 2104 - 242 were obtained with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris , oke et al .",
    "1995 ) with its polarimeter ( goodrich , cohen , putney 1995 ) at the keck ii 10 m telescope from july 1997 till july 1999 under subarcsec seeing conditions ( seeing varying between @xmath30.7 and 1.1 arcsec ) .",

    "the slit width was always 1 arcsec , except for 4c-00.54 and 4c+23.56 for which we used a 1.5 arcsec slit .",

    "1994 and carilli et al .",
    "1997 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "each individual frame was calibrated in wavelength and corrected for slit curvature using arc spectra .",
    "this initial wavelength calibration was refined using strong sky lines .",
    "the fwhm of the instrumental profile ( ip , table 1 ) was determined from unblended sky lines .",
    "these values correspond to a range in resolution of 320610 km s@xmath2 at the redshifted heii@xmath241640 wavelength .",
    "variations from object to object are probably due to mechanical instabilities within the instrument causing variation on the line spread function .    in order to compensate for the effects of flexure in the instrument , we extracted from every frame a section around ly@xmath4 and nv@xmath241240 and one around civ@xmath241550 and heii@xmath241640 .",
    "the individual sub - frames corresponding to the same spectral range were spatially aligned ( using the continuum centroid ) and combined .",
    "the two final frames ( one for ly@xmath4 and nv and another one for civ and heii ) were also spatially aligned , assuming that the continuum centroid has the same spatial position at all wavelengths .",
    "this is reasonable in this small spectral range , taking also into account that the spatial resolution element has a large physical size ( @xmath3 8 - 9 kpc ) . for a more detailed description of the observations and data",

    "similar rest frame fir luminosities have also been estimated for high redshift radio galaxies from submm observations ( hughes , dunlop & rawlings 1997 ) .",
    "since the calculated parameters are gross upper limits , we can only say that a scenario such that the halos have been deposited by galactic winds is not excluded by the data set .",
    "the discovery of the giant quiescent halos in all objects in the sample we have studied suggests that they are a common ingredient of high redshift radio galaxies .",
    "although the nature of the halos  be they disks , spherical envelopes , cooling flow nebulae , gas deposited by winds  is not clear , they are giant gaseous reservoirs within which the radio galaxy is embedded .",
    "our results suggest that the halos surround the object completely .",
    "the gas we see in emission is the fraction of the halo inside the ionization cones which has been ionized by the quasar continuum .",
    "the gas outside these cones is likely to have much lower ionization level .",

    "we proposed in vm02 that the lsbhs could be part of the initial gas reservoir from which the galaxy started to condense . according to galaxy formation models ( e.g. haiman , spaans and quataert 2000 ) , dark matter halos collapse in a cooling flow manner . as a result",
    "the baryons settle into rotationally supported exponential disks embedded in the dark matter halo .",
    "circular velocities of @xmath3few hundred km s@xmath2 ( consistent with our observations ) would be expected for halos with masses @xmath15several @xmath6 10@xmath28 m@xmath29 .    according to haiman , spaans and quataert ( 2000 ) , the expected",
    "line widths are of order @xmath330[(1+@xmath30)/6 ]   , which corresponds to @xmath3915 km s@xmath2 for heii .",
    "the observed fwhm of the lines from the quiescent halos can be easily reconciled with the models taking into account that most disks are probably not seen edge on .",
    "according to the models , due to ly@xmath4 cooling radiation , the halos would have surface brightness @xmath3few @xmath6 10@xmath31 erg @xmath8 s@xmath2 arcsec@xmath9 out to the virial radius ( @xmath1415 arcsec ) .",
    "however , if a quasar switches on at some point and illuminates the halos , the expected surface brightness would rise to @xmath310@xmath32 erg @xmath8 s@xmath2 arcsec@xmath9 @xcite within the strgrem radius consistent with our observations .",
    "the line widths , velocity shifts , measured angular sizes , line luminosities and surface brightness of the giant quiescent halos are consistent with this scenario .",
    "the interpretation of a cooling flow and a rotating disk do not exclude each other , they could be two consecutive phases of the same process .",
    "what is clear in our case , is that the halos are not made of pristine material .",
    "they have been already enriched with heavy elements , which suggests an advanced state in the process .",
    "we have also found preliminary evidence for rotation in some of the halos ( although it is not possible to discard other interpretations ) .",
    "if this galaxy formation scenario is valid , we expect that similar structures exist associated with normal and active galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "the halos are likely to be more easily detected around powerful active galaxies , since the active nucleus provides an intense supply of ionizing photons . in fact , giant quiescent ( total extension @xmath14100 kpc ) emission line halos have been found in some @xmath331 radio galaxies ( e.g. stockton , ridgway & kellogg 1996 , solrzano - iarrea , tadhunter & axon 2001 )",
    ".    the quiescent lsbhs could be related ( progenitors ? ) to the giant hi disk like structures found around some low redshift radio galaxies @xcite and elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "an important difference is that the hi absorption line in these objects is usually much narrower ( @xmath34100 km s@xmath2 ) than the emission lines from the quiescent lsbhs .",
    "this suggests that the high redshift structures are less settled .",
    "it is possible that similar giant gaseous structures have also been found around non active galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "steidel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) discovered two giant ( physical extent @xmath14100 @xmath35 ) diffuse ly@xmath4 emitters apparently associated with previously known ly break galaxies at @xmath363.09 . at low redshift ,",
    "observations of absorption line systems in the spectra of background quasars have provided evidence for large ( @xmath37100 @xmath35 kpc ) extended gaseous envelopes that surround galaxies of a wide range of luminosity and morphological type ( e.g. chen , lanzetta & webb 2001 ; lanzetta et al .",
    "these galactic envelopes might have similar origin and nature as the giant quiescent halos we have discussed around high redshift radio galaxies .",
    "therefore , we propose a scenario such that a cooling flow has been triggered as a result of the collapse of a dark matter halo .",
    "the baryons will end up settling in a rotationally supported disk . during this process",
    ", the quasar has switched on and illuminates and excites the gas .",
    "this could happen before or after the gas has settled into the disk .",
    "the emission from the gas becomes easily detectable in this way , since its surface brightness is much brighter than expected from pure ly@xmath4 cooling radiation . during the process",
    ", intense star formation has already taken place and outflows associated with supernovae explosions or the quasar activity have enriched the halos with heavy elements at tens of kpc from the nuclear region .",
    "we have studied the kinematic properties of the extended gas in a sample of 10 high redshift ( @xmath02.5 ) radio galaxies observed with the keck ii and vlt telescopes .",
    "we have discovered in all 10 hzrg ( including 0828 + 193 , vm02 ) giant halos of quiescent gas with fwhm(heii)@xmath38850 km s@xmath2 and velocity shifts across the nebulae @xmath38600 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this component often extends over about 50 kpc from the nuclear region and sometimes beyond the radio structures .",
    "the emission line spectra of the quiescent halos are typical of active galaxies . in addition ,",
    "8 out of 10 objects contain kinematically perturbed gas usually with high surface brightness and located inside the radio structures .",

    "cooling radiation , shock photoionization and stellar photoionization can not explain at the same time all measured properties ( line luminosities , surface brightness , sizes , line ratios ) of the quiescent halos along the radio axis .",
