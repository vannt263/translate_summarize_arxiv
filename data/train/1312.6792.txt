    "reaction and interaction cross sections of light neutron- and proton - rich projectiles with light target nuclei have been used extensively as an inclusive observable with sensitivity to projectile size and binding .",
    "calculations of the elastic scattering , reaction and breakup observables of weakly - bound two - neutron - halo nuclei , the ground states of which can be modelled using three - body - model wave functions , is a four - body reaction problem .",
    "as was shown in previous three- and four - body analyses of the reaction cross sections for weakly - bound nuclei , the treatment of breakup degrees of freedom is essential to obtain a quantitative description of the reaction observables .",
    "practical calculations that treat the few - body structure of the projectile explicitly are now possible .",
    "for example , at high energies , of order 800 mev / nucleon , the eikonal ( glauber ) theory has been employed @xcite that provides an efficient approximate methodology .",
    "counter to ones intuition , the inclusion of strongly - coupled breakup channels , that remove flux from the elastic channel , actually resulted in calculated reaction cross sections that were smaller than those obtained using simpler ( no - breakup ) one - body density - based models , which overestimate the contribution to the cross sections from the dilute halo of one or more weakly - bound neutrons @xcite .",
    "this is also expected to be the case for reactions of the heaviest particle - bound carbon isotope , @xmath0c , for which first measurements are now possible , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "that data set suggested an enhanced @xmath0c reaction cross section on a proton target at relatively low energy and the authors used a simplified reaction model to infer a very large root - mean - squared ( rms ) matter radius for @xmath0c .",
    "inclusive measurements of coulomb dissociation of @xmath0c on a heavy ( pb ) target @xcite and of fast nucleon removal on a light ( c ) target @xcite have also recently been performed at riken at energies in excess of 200 mev / nucleon , also displaying enhanced reaction yields characteristic of weak binding .    in this paper",
    "we exploit the coupled - channels adiabatic approach of christley _",
    "@xcite for ( four - body ) model calculations of reaction cross sections , @xmath2 .",
    "we compare these calculations with the adiabatic plus eikonal four - body dynamical approach @xcite that makes additional approximations .",
    "our primary objectives are twofold .",
    "( i ) to quantify the sensitivity of the @xmath2 to the structure assumed for this weakly - bound dripline ( and borromean ) system and clarify the breakup channels of most importance .",
    "since the adiabatic method is computationally more efficient , a knowledge of this convergence may offer insight into the likely model space(s ) needed for higher - energy calculations using e.g. the coupled discretized continuum channels approach @xcite .",
    "( ii ) to quantify the differences between the @xmath2 calculations that use and do not use the additional eikonal approximation(s ) to the adiabatic model .",
    "to do this we explore the @xmath0c nucleus ground - state wave function within a core plus two - valence neutron ( @xmath3c+n+n ) three - body framework @xcite and the reaction dynamics using the four - body adiabatic model , see @xcite .",
    "the converged results of this approach are compared with calculations that use the same @xmath0c wave functions and optical model interactions but which make the additional eikonal approximation to the reaction dynamics of the four - body problem : as have been used previously @xcite .",
    "this paper supersedes the brief report of preliminary results of the present study of ref .  @xcite .",
    "the nucleus @xmath0c and its neutron - unbound subsystem @xmath4c remain poorly understood . both the two - neutron separation energy from @xmath0c and the ground - state energy of @xmath4c are poorly determined . the 2003 mass evaluation @xcite gives @xmath5(22)= 0.4(8 ) mev and @xmath6(21)=@xmath7 mev , both with large uncertainties . a recent direct mass measurement places a limit of @xmath8 mev @xcite , however , since",
    "@xmath0c is known to be bound , this might be interpreted as @xmath9 mev @xcite .",
    "irrespective of such details , @xmath10c(@xmath4c ) is certainly bound(unbound ) and thus @xmath0c has a borromean , @xmath3c+n+n three - body character and is very interesting structurally .",
    "the shell - model suggests that this @xmath1116 nucleus will , predominantly , be described by a @xmath12 ^ 6\\,[2s_{1/2}]^2 $ ] closed neutron sub - shell configuration .",
    "the expectation is therefore that @xmath0c will have an extended , predominantly @xmath13-wave two - neutron - halo wave function leading to large reaction , nuclear , and coulomb dissociation cross sections in its collisions with a target nucleus .",
    "a very recent analysis of new measurements of ( inclusive ) neutron removal reactions from the most neutron - rich carbon isotopes @xcite , also made at the ribf , riken at 240 mev per nucleon , is broadly consistent with this shell - model picture .",
    "the @xmath0c(@xmath141n ) data suggest a large spectroscopic factor ( of @xmath11.4 ) for @xmath15 neutron removal to an unbound @xmath4c(@xmath16 ) ground state , which subsequently decays by neutron emission to @xmath3c .",
    "these data are also consistent with ( though not highly sensitive to ) the @xmath5(22 ) and @xmath17(21 ) of the 2003 mass evaluation @xcite and the @xmath5(22 ) limit of the recent direct mass measurement @xcite .",
    "this same set of measurements @xcite also identifies a non - negligible @xmath18 ^ 2 $ ] component in the ( isolated ) @xmath3c(@xmath19 ) ground - state , manifest as population of the @xmath20c(@xmath16 ) ground - state in the neutron removal reaction from @xmath3c projectiles .",
    "this complication and the finer details of the structure of the @xmath3c core within @xmath0c will not be explored further in this paper .      here",
    "we treat @xmath0c using the three - body model , shown schematically in figure [ fig1 ] , as a @xmath3c(@xmath19 ) core+n+n system .",
    "related @xmath0c structure studies can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , on which we comment .",
    "the core is assumed to have a filled @xmath12 ^ 6 $ ] sub - shell .",
    "the n - n and nn - core relative orbital angular momenta are @xmath21 and @xmath22 in our chosen ( t - basis ) jacobi coordinate set @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "( color online ) schematic representation of the angular momentum decomposition and the angular momentum couplings ( in the jacobi t - basis ) used for the description of the @xmath3c(@xmath19 ) core+n+n borromean three - body projectile in its ground and ( continuum ) excited states . in the case of the @xmath0c ground state , with @xmath25 , @xmath26 and",

    "the projectile s ground state wave function ( and the structure of the wave function in the breakup channel with total angular momentum @xmath31 ) is written , in general , as a sum of individual angular momentum components @xmath32_{{{\\cal l}}}\\otimes s\\right]_{i m_i}\\,\\frac{u_{[[\\ell_1 \\ell_2]{{\\cal l}}s ] i } ( \\rho , r)}{\\rho r } , \\label{ground}\\ ] ] only a small number of which are expected to have significant probabilities , as discussed below .",

    "for the @xmath0c ground state @xmath25 and thus @xmath26 and , given that @xmath28 { \\cal l}$ ] , then @xmath34 or @xmath30 .",
    "to solve for the three - body wave function we use the gogny , pires and de tourreil ( gpt ) interaction @xcite for @xmath35 .",
    "the neutron-@xmath3c core interactions @xmath36 are described by woods - saxon plus spin - orbit interactions .",
    "for all @xmath37-states we use radius and diffuseness parameters 1.25 fm and 0.65 fm , respectively , and a spin - orbit strength @xmath38=6.3 mev .",
    "this ( derivative woods - saxon ) neutron-@xmath3c spin - orbit potential is defined according to the convention of becchetti and greenlees @xcite .",
    "the depth of the central @xmath39-wave neutron - core interaction , @xmath40=42.0 mev , was chosen to bind the neutron+@xmath3c @xmath41 state ( by 2.3 mev ) while the @xmath42 state is unbound by 1.9 mev .",
    "this fixed potential was used for all @xmath43 neutron+@xmath3c configurations other than the @xmath13-wave states . for the @xmath13-states",
    "this depth is too strong , binding the @xmath15 state .",
    "the @xmath13-state well depth , @xmath44 , was thus adjusted ( reduced ) so that the n+@xmath3c @xmath15 state is unbound , as expected empirically .",
    "this two - body @xmath13-state potential depth and the strength , @xmath45 , of an added attractive central hyperradial three - body force , @xmath46 ^ 3)\\ , \\label{3bf}\\ ] ] were then used as parameters to generate bound @xmath0c three - body wave functions with a range of three - body energies , allowed by the uncertainty on the evaluated @xmath0c two - nucleon separation energy .",
    "we use @xmath47 mev .",
    "each wave function is thus characterised by ( a ) the position of the n+@xmath3c @xmath48 virtual state pole ( located using a complex @xmath49-plane s - matrix search @xcite ) and its associated scattering length @xmath50 and ( b ) its bound three - body energy eigenvalue , @xmath51 . even in the absence of the added three - body force @xmath45",
    ", @xmath0c is found to be bound with the potential set used , provided that @xmath52 fm . with @xmath53 and the largest @xmath50 value , model k5 in table [ tab1 ] , @xmath54 kev .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     calculations were also carried out using the eikonal ( glauber ) few - body approach as outlined in section [ glaub ] . for consistency and fair comparison with the coupled channels adiabatic approach , these calculations included the same dominant @xmath5500]0 $ ] and [ [ 22]00]0 configurations of the calculated ground state wave functions .",
    "the cross sections obtained are shown in table [ table2 ] , as @xmath2(gl ) , and in figure [ fig2 ] ( black filled squares ) .",
    "the dependence of the results on the @xmath0c rms radius are seen to track those of the coupled channels equations but the magnitudes of the cross sections are consistently smaller , by @xmath12% , than those of the final , most complete @xmath2(ad ) calculations .",
    "this level of agreement provides a benchmark of the accuracy of the glauber few - body approach at an energy of 300 mev / nucleon , which is valuable given the relative computational efficiency of the method .",
    "we also note that , unlike the coupled channels adiabatic calculations , there is no explicit truncation of the breakup channels model space used in the eikonal / glauber approach , although , based on the observed convergence of the adiabatic calculations , figure [ fig2 ] , we do not believe that this is the source of the small differences observed .",
    "the eikonal / glauber approach also includes a more approximate treatment of the reaction dynamics , ( i ) based on the eikonal elastic s - matrices , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , that are calculated from the neutron- and @xmath3c - target optical potentials assuming straight line paths through the interaction region , and ( ii ) assuming there is no longitudinal momentum transfer in the collisions with the target .",
    "thus , the calculated cross sections show both the convergence of the adiabatic model calculations and quantify the small differences between the adiabatic and adiabatic+eikonal dynamical treatments on the calculated projectile - target absorption @xmath58 and reaction cross section calculations for the @xmath0c - target system at the energies of interest here .",
    "these differences may of course be more significant , quantitatively , for other more exclusive observables and will be clarified in future work in this direction .",
    "we have presented converged coupled channels adiabatic four - body reaction model calculations ( using a three - body structure model ) of the reaction cross sections for the last particle - bound carbon isotope @xmath0c , at intermediate energy .",
    "the coupled channels - based calculations of this work are compared with glauber few - body model calculations , that make the additional eikonal approximation in the solution of the adiabatic schrdinger equation .",
    "a set of model three - body wave functions were obtained , all of which have reasonable two - neutron separation energies @xmath5 , and which have different values for the scattering length @xmath50 for the assumed virtual @xmath15-state in the unbound n+@xmath3c two - body subsystem .",
    "we have detailed the formulation of the @xmath0c elastic scattering s - matrix from which we calculate the reaction cross sections .",
    "the calculations presented include @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61wave four - body breakup channels .",
    "@xmath62-wave effects were found to be negligible .",
    "the approach used is well - suited to the energy of the present study , 300 mev per nucleon , and the calculations reveal the degree of sensitivity of the reaction cross sections to the assumed structure of the projectile , in particular its rms radius .",
    "compared to calculations for lighter nuclei , the range of rms radii from the different @xmath0c three - body structures is relatively small with a corresponding smaller cross section sensitivity .",
    "comparisons of these coupled channels adiabatic results with four - body glauber model calculations , based on the same three - body wave functions and neutron- and @xmath3c - target interactions , agree to within 2% .",
    "the approach is relevant to current and future experimental programmes at fragmentation - based rib facilities , such as ribf , frib and gsi / fair .",
    "the present analysis reveals the high precision of experimental reaction cross section data that is needed to interrogate the @xmath0c structure and the breakup reaction dynamics , pointing to the likely advantage of more exclusive observables .",
