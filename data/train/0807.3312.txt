    "[ q : existence ] does @xmath2 admit a ( uniform or nonuniform ) lattice ? 2 .",
    "[ q : covolumes ] what is the set of _ covolumes _ of lattices in @xmath2 , that is , the set of positive reals @xmath9 3 .",
    "[ q : generation ] are lattices in @xmath2 finitely generated ?",
    "these questions have been well - studied in classical cases .",
    "for example , suppose @xmath2 is a reductive algebraic group over a local field @xmath10 of characteristic @xmath11 .",
    "then @xmath2 admits a uniform lattice , constructed by arithmetic means ( borel  harder  @xcite ) , and a nonuniform lattice only if @xmath10 is archimedean ( tamagawa  @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath2 is a semisimple real lie group , the set @xmath12 is in most cases discrete ( see  @xcite and its references ) . if in addition @xmath2 is higher - rank , then @xmath2 and hence its lattices have kazhdan s property ( t ) ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "since countable groups with property ( t ) are finitely generated , it follows that all lattices in @xmath2 are finitely generated .",
    "a nonclassical case is @xmath2 the automorphism group of a locally finite tree @xmath13 .",
    "the study of lattices in @xmath14 was initiated by bass and lubotzky , and has yielded many surprising differences from classical results ( see the survey  @xcite and the reference  @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the set @xmath12 is in many cases nondiscrete , and nonuniform tree lattices are never finitely generated .",
    "in fact , the automorphism group @xmath2 of any locally finite polyhedral complex @xmath15 is naturally a locally compact group ( see section  [ ss : lattices ] ) . for many @xmath15 with @xmath16 ,",
    "there is greater rigidity than for trees , as might be expected in higher dimensions .",

    "mozes  @xcite proved a ` normal subgroup theorem ' for products of trees ( parallel to that of margulis  @xcite for higher - rank semisimple lie groups ) , and bourdon ",
    "pajot  @xcite and xie  @xcite established quasi - isometric rigidity for certain fuchsian buildings . on the other hand , lattices in @xmath17",
    "can exhibit the same flexibility as tree lattices .",
    "for example , the set @xmath12 is nondiscrete for certain right - angled buildings  @xcite and fuchsian buildings  @xcite .",

    "the davis complex is a locally finite , piecewise euclidean @xmath20 polyhedral complex , and the coxeter group @xmath3 may be regarded as a uniform lattice in @xmath2 .",
    "our results are the main theorem and its corollaries  [ c : nondiscreteness ] and  [ c : infinite_generation ] below , which establish tree - like properties for lattices in many such @xmath2 .",
    "after stating these results , we discuss how they apply to ( barycentric subdivisions of ) buildings and non - buildings , and to many davis complexes @xmath0 with @xmath21 .    to state the main theorem , recall that for a coxeter system @xmath1 with @xmath22 , and any @xmath23 , the _ special subgroup _ @xmath24 is the subgroup of @xmath3 generated by the elements @xmath25 .",

    "this was already known for @xmath19 , where @xmath0 is any davis complex ( haglund  paulin  @xcite ) ; our results thus provide an alternative proof of this fact in some cases .",
    "we describe several infinite families of examples of davis complexes @xmath0 to which our results apply in section  [ s : examples ] below . to establish these applications , we use properties of spherical building ( in  @xcite ) , and some results of graph theory  @xcite . in two dimensions ,",
    "examples include the fuchsian buildings considered in  @xcite , and some of the highly symmetric _ platonic polygonal complexes _ investigated by witkowski  @xcite .",
