    "the braid group @xmath1 possesses nice combinatorial structures , called _ garside structures_. a garside structure allows us to solve the word problem and the conjugacy problem , and gives an efficient method to compute the length function for some generating sets called _ simple elements_. in this paper , we restrict our attention to one of the standard garside structure of the braid groups found by birman - ko - lee in @xcite , known as the _ dual garside structure_. we study a relationship between the _ dual garside length _ , the length function associated to the dual garside structure , and linear representations of braid groups .    in @xcite , the author and wiest proved that one of the most famous linear representation , the _ lawrence - krammer - bigelow representation _ ( the lkb representation , in short ) detects the dual garside length in a simple and natural way , as was conjectured by krammer @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to generalize this result for two infinite families of braid representations derived from different constructions .",
    "one family of representations is called _",
    "lawrence s representations _ constructed by lawrence in @xcite in a topological method .",
    "the other family is derived from the quantum group @xmath0 , and called _ generic highest weight vectors_. we will prove that these representations also detect the dual garside length in a simple and natural way as the lkb representation does .",
    "let us explain what the phrase _",
    "`` in a simple and natural way '' _ means .",
    "let @xmath2 be a ring and @xmath3 $ ] be a laurent polynomial of the variable @xmath4 whose coefficient is in @xmath2 .",
    "we denote the maximal and the minimal degree of the variable @xmath4 by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . for an @xmath7-matrix @xmath8 over @xmath9 $ ]",
    ", we define @xmath10    now consider a linear representation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a free @xmath9$]-module .",
    "there are many known constructions of such linear representations of braid groups . in many cases , from a construction of the linear representation @xmath13 one can find a certain natural basis @xmath14 of @xmath12 . by using the basis @xmath15 , we express the representation @xmath13 as a matrix representation @xmath16 ) .\\ ] ] so for each braid @xmath17 we get an @xmath18-matrix @xmath19 over @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "we say the representation @xmath20 _ naturally _ and _ directly detects _ the dual garside length if the supremum and the infimum of @xmath17 are some constant multiples of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . here the supremum and infimum of braids are integers derived from the dual garside structure which will compute the dual garside length . roughly speaking , @xmath20 naturally and directly detects the dual garside length means that the dual garside length is equal to some constant multiples of @xmath23 , the span of the variable @xmath4 .",
    "our results give a rather surprising and strong connection between linear representations and the dual garside structure .",
    "assume that we used other basis @xmath24 of @xmath12 .",
    "then it is still true that one can compute the dual garside length from the matrix expression of @xmath25 with respect to the basis @xmath24 .",
    "however , for such basis to compute the dual garside length it is not sufficient to know @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we need to know the whole matrix , and the formula of dual garside length might be quite complicated .",
    "thus our results says , roughly speaking , a natural basis of representation derived from a geometric or algebraic point of view is also natural with respect to the dual garside structure .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : dualgarside ]",
    "we review a definition of dual garside length . in section [ sec : lawrence ] we briefly summarize bigelow - like treatment of lawrence s representation .",
    "a construction of quantum representations will be reviewed in section [ sec : quantum ] .",
    "we will also review kohno s theorem which identifies lawrence s representation with certain quantum representations , called _ generic null vectors_. finally we will prove the main results of this paper , the dual garside length formulae in section [ sec : proof ] .",
    "unfortunately , our proof of the dual garside length formula for quantum representation , theorem [ theorem : q ] , is indirect and tells us nothing why such an equality holds .",
    "our proof is based on a topological method developed in @xcite and we needed to use theorem [ theorem : l ] , the dual garside length formula for lawrence s representation .",
    "contrary , the proof of theorem [ theorem : l ] partially provides a reason why lawrence s representation detects the dual garside length . as we have seen @xcite , the dual garside length",
    "are related to certain abelian covering ( or , local coefficients ) of punctured disc , which is a key ingredient of construction of lawrence s representation .",
    "this observation and non - vanishing of the homological intersection pairing called noodle - fork pairing ( lemma [ lemma : key ] ) which was the key of the proof of faithfulness in bigelow s theory lead to the dual garside length .",
    "it is an interesting problem to find an alternative proof of theorem [ theorem : q ] via the theory of quantum groups .",
    "our results suggest that there are unknown relationships between the dual garside structure and quantum groups : in particular , the universal r - matrix of quantum groups might have a rich combinatorial structure , than the simple fact that it gives rise to a solution of yang - baxter equation .",
    "it is also interesting to study a relationship between linear representations of braids and _ usual garside structure _ , the other standard garside structure of braids . in @xcite krammer",
    "proved that the lkb representation naturally and directly detects the usual garside structure , by using the variable @xmath28 instead of @xmath29 .",
    "hence it is natural to expect that lawrence s representation and quantum representations which we considered here also detects the usual garside structure , by using the other variables .    in a theory of the braid groups and quantum groups ,",
    "various conventions are used . to avoid confusions ,",
    "we summarize our conventions and notations below .",
    "* all actions of the braid groups are considered as _ left _",
    "actions , and the dual garside structure we are treating is _ right _ garside structure , as we will review in section [ sec : dualgarside ] . *",
    "all conventions about quantum groups @xmath0 follows from @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath30-numbers , @xmath30-fractionals , and @xmath30-binomial coefficients are defined by @xmath31_{q } ! = [ n]_{q}[n-1]_{q } \\cdots [ 2]_{q}[1]_{q},\\ ] ] @xmath31_{q } = \\frac{q^{n}-q^{-n}}{q - q^{-1 } } , \\;\\ ; \\;\\ ; \\left [ \\!\\!\\begin{array}{c } n \\\\ j \\end{array } \\!\\ !",
    "= \\frac{[n]_{q}!}{[n - j]_{q}![j]_{q}!}.\\ ] ] as in @xcite , we use kassel s textbook @xcite as a main reference of quantum groups .",
    "one main difference is that we use a variable ( parameter ) @xmath32 , which corresponds @xmath33 in kassel s book .",
    "* as an element of mapping class group of @xmath34 , a positive standard generator @xmath35 of @xmath1 is identified with the _ right - handed _ ,",
    "that is , the _ unti - clockwise _ half dehn - twist which interchanges the punctures @xmath36 and @xmath37 of @xmath34 .",
    "+ it should be emphasized that this conventions is opposite to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this convention is adapted to simplify the identification of quantum and homological representations , corollary [ theorem : jkconjecture ] . * the rest of conventions about homological representations , topological construction of representations we mainly follow @xcite .",
    "in particular , the positive direction of winding ( the meridian of hypersurfaces ) is chosen as the _",
