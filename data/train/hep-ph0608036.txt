    "high energy scattering in qcd was recently shown to be essentially similar to a reaction - diffusion process @xcite . to understand this correspondence , one needs to introduce an ( unphysical ) forward elastic scattering amplitude @xmath0 , that encodes the interaction probability for _ given _ parton or field configurations of the incoming hadrons , at rapidity @xmath1 , and for a characteristic transverse distance scale @xmath2 .",
    "the physical scattering amplitude @xmath3 is the average of @xmath0 over all possible realizations of the fields or partons . although @xmath4 is not measurable experimentally , it is a quantity that has also to be introduced when one wants to write a monte - carlo event generator .",
    "the equation that governs the rapidity evolution of @xmath4 at fixed impact - parameter belongs to the universality class of the stochastic fisher - kolmogorov - petrovsky - piscounov ( fkpp ) equation @xcite , or equivalently , of the reggeon field theory equation .",
    "it can be seen as a stochastic extension of the well - known balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite , that describes a peculiar limit of high energy qcd .",
    "it is convenient to go to momentum space using the transformation @xcite @xmath5 the evolution of @xmath6 can be written , for example , in the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is a representation of the bfkl kernel @xcite in momentum space and @xmath10 is a noise of zero mean that varies randomly by typically one unit when @xmath11 or @xmath12 are changed by one unit .",
    "@xmath13 is the average of @xmath6 with respect to the noise @xmath10 .",
    "this new approach to high energy scattering in qcd , that makes use of ideas and tools of statistical physics , has already inspired a number of theoretical works .",
    "( [ rft ] ) itself was also subsequently discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and studied numerically ( with a gaussian noise @xmath10 ) in ref .",
    "many developments from different perspectives have followed : in particular , the connection to reggeon field theory was investigated @xcite , a qcd derivation of eq .",
    "( [ rft ] ) was searched for @xcite , and different formalisms to describe the same physics were proposed @xcite .",
    "( [ rft ] ) may be interpreted in the following way : it describes the evolution in time @xmath14 of a fraction @xmath6 of @xmath15 particles ( gluons ) per unit of @xmath16 that multiply and diffuse in @xmath17 through the branching diffusion kernel @xmath9 , and that recombine through the nonlinear term .",
    "( [ rft ] ) is however not an exact equation of qcd , and should by no way be interpreted as such .",
    "it is rather a synthetic form of writing two exactly known limits : the large parton density limit , in which the evolution of @xmath6 is given by the balitsky - kovchegov equation @xmath18 and the low density limit , represented by the linear stochastic equation @xmath19    let us briefly recall a bit more precisely the qcd content of eq .",
    "( [ rft ] ) ( we refer the reader to the original papers @xcite for details ) . in the low density region of phase space ( equivalently , in the region in which the amplitude is small , @xmath20 ) , it is useful to view rapidity evolution in the framework of the color dipole model @xcite .",
    "one goes to the reference frame of one of the interacting hadrons , that we assume to be a quark - antiquark dipole for simplicity and that we will call the probe .",
    "the second hadron carries all the rapidity and qcd evolution and will be referred to as the target . in the large-@xmath21 limit , the fock state of the target may be represented by a set of color dipoles .",
    "each of these dipoles , characterized by a two - dimensional position vector @xmath22 in transverse coordinate space , is spanned by two gluons respectively sitting at positions @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the model is defined by the stochastic branching of the dipoles that occurs as the target is boosted to larger rapidities : in a step @xmath25 of rapidity , each dipole present at rapidity @xmath1 has the probability @xmath26 to be replaced by two new dipoles of respective sizes @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    when nonlinear effects can be neglected , the relationship between the number of dipoles @xmath29 and the amplitude @xmath30 for the scattering of the probe dipole of size @xmath31 off a random configuration of the target reads , in appropriate normalizations ( see e.g. @xcite ) , @xmath32 this relationship turns out to be approximately local in dipole sizes and impact parameter : @xmath30 is of order @xmath33 times the number of dipoles in the considered configuration of the target whose sizes are in a bin of width 1 ( on a logarithmic scale ) centered on @xmath34 , and which sit within a distance @xmath34 of the probe in impact parameter .",

    "( [ corresp ] ) , by transforming to momentum space using eq .",
    "( [ fouriertransform ] ) , and by averaging over the angle in the transverse plane , one would get the linear terms in eq .",

    "( [ dipole ] ) .",
    "dipole branching leads to an exponential increase of their number with rapidity , and consequently , to an unlimited rise of @xmath4 if formula  ( [ corresp ] ) is applied : this would be inconsistent with unitarity , which requires the bound @xmath35 .",
    "it is believed that this rise is tamed by nonlinear effects @xcite that limit the number of dipoles in the target .",
    "unfortunately , the latter effects have not yet been formulated in the framework of the dipole model .",
    "it is not even clear that dipoles should still be the relevant degrees of freedom in that regime .    on the other hand",
    ", one knows the equation that gives the average scattering amplitude at rapidity @xmath36 given the amplitude at rapidity @xmath1 , with the exact nonlinearity that preserves the unitarity of @xmath4 .",
    "it reads : @xmath37 this equation is equivalent to the first equation in the celebrated balitsky hierarchy @xcite .",

    "( [ bkmom ] ) .",
    "this is realized when the underlying effective number of dipoles is large , i.e. in the region of high density .",
    "the corresponding equation is the bk equation @xcite and is in the universality class of the ( deterministic ) fkpp equation @xcite .",
    "the evolution of higher order correlators of @xmath4s that would be needed to be able to evolve @xmath4 also outside the dense region has still not been derived in a systematic way for the generic case of dipole - dipole scattering .",
    "although the correct formalism to describe the evolution of @xmath4 accurately in all regimes is still not available , exact asymptotic results  @xcite universal enough to also apply to qcd amplitudes have been found from the approximate formulation  ( [ rft ] ) . unfortunately , their validity is quite reduced since the limit @xmath41 had to be assumed , which is of course out of experimental reach",
    ". hence it would be useful to understand what can be expected quantitatively from what is known up to now , beyond the far asymptotics .",
    "the goal of this paper is to show that quite accurate results for the evolution of the qcd scattering amplitudes may be extracted from a numerical study that appropriately matches a monte - carlo simulation of the color dipole model , valid in the dilute regime , to the evolution of the amplitude given in eq .",
    "( [ bk ] ) , useful in the dense regime .",
    "we shall propose a factorization procedure of @xmath4 , on an event - by - event basis , that we justify by a calculation in the framework of a zero - dimensional model and motivate and test on a one - dimensional toy model .",
    "we then explain how this factorization could be applied to qcd .",
    "in a first stage , we study a zero - dimensional model ( transverse variables are not considered ) in order to introduce the factorization rigorously .",
    "zero - dimensional models were investigated for possible applications to qcd some time ago @xcite .",
    "solutions for models of that kind have recently been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , from different perspectives .",
    "the solutions which have been obtained will help us to assess the validity of the factorization that we shall propose here .",
    "we investigate the time evolution of a specific markovian process in the universality class of the zero - dimensional stochastic fkpp equation .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath42 particles . between times",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 , each particle has a probability @xmath45 to split in two particles . for each pair of particles ,",
    "there is a probability @xmath46 that one of them is lost , and thus each given particle has probability @xmath47 to disappear .",
    "these rules completely define the process .",
    "there are several ways to represent this evolution .",
    "we may write the distribution of the number @xmath48 of particles at time @xmath44 given the number of particles @xmath49 at time @xmath43 : @xmath50 this equation may be cast in the form of a stochastic equation for @xmath49 by first computing the mean and variance of @xmath48 given @xmath49 , with the help of eq .",
    "( [ probazero ] ) .",
    "this enables one to write the time evolution of @xmath49 in terms of a drift and of a noise of zero - mean and normalized variance , namely : @xmath51 where @xmath10 is such that @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "note that the distribution of @xmath10 depends on @xmath49 and is not a gaussian .",
    "this last point is easy to understand : the evolution of @xmath54 is intrinsically discontinuous , since it stems from a rescaling of @xmath49 , which is an integer at all times . a brownian evolution ( i.e. with a gaussian noise )",
    "would necessarily be continuous . for completeness",
    ", we write the statistics of @xmath55 , which is easy to derive from the evolution of @xmath56 : @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we see well the jumps induced by the terms proportional to @xmath60 .    formulating the process with the help of a stochastic equation such as  ( [ evoln ] ) has no real advantage at this point . here , we just aimed at showing explicitely the connection with stochastic partial differential equations .      instead of looking at a state of definite occupancy",
    ", one could also consider the evolution of a poissonian state whose occupation numbers are distributed as @xmath61 and follow the evolution of @xmath62 , that is to say , compute the probability distribution of @xmath63 given @xmath62 , @xmath64 .",
    "as can be easily checked , the moments of @xmath63 are the factorial moments of @xmath48 .",
    "this statement may be written as @xmath65 replacing eqs .",
    "( [ probazero ] ) and  ( [ poisson ] ) in eq .",

    "( [ probazero ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ evoln ] ) , this may be expressed in the form of a stochastic evolution equation for @xmath62 @xcite @xmath69 this is an ito equation : @xmath70 is a gaussian white noise satisfying @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath62 is now evolving continuously , unlike @xmath49 .",
    "( [ itosfkpp ] ) is the zero - dimensional version of the stochastic fkpp equation .",
    "it is of course consistent with eq .",
    "( [ evoln ] ) , since the moments of @xmath73 are the factorial moments of @xmath56 . starting from eq .",
    "( [ itosfkpp ] ) and transforming it into a hierarchy for the factorial moments of @xmath49 , one can compute the first few orders of @xmath74 in a @xmath75 expansion resummed for large @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the result turns out to be an asymptotic borel - summable series .",
    "it reads @xcite @xmath76 each term may be interpreted as the result of the evaluation of a diagram with a number @xmath77 of `` pomerons '' being exchanged in the @xmath43-channel .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed calculation in such a framework .",
    "the series  ( [ borelseries ] ) can be rewritten in the form of a borel integral , @xmath78 which eventually may be expressed in terms of special functions .",
    "( [ borelseries ] ) and  ( [ borel ] ) are a priori valid for @xmath79 .",
    "actually , it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite from the exact evaluation of subleading orders , that its effective range of validity is much broader , @xmath80 .",
    "the classical limit is also easily identified from eq .",
    "( [ itosfkpp ] ) : indeed , a classical state has a definite value of @xmath73 .",
    "the classical path @xmath81 is obtained by solving the deterministic part of eq .",
    "( [ itosfkpp ] ) , namely @xmath82 this approximation is expected to be valid only when the typical number of particles in the system is large .",
    "it is useful to notice that the steady fixed point of the evolution is @xmath83 .    the formulation of eq .",
    "( [ itosfkpp ] ) is helpful for analytical calculations of the moments of @xmath49 .",
    "however , in order to describe a physical system that starts evolution with a definite number of particles , one needs to introduce complex values of the poisson parameter @xmath73 .",
    "this makes eq .",
    "( [ itosfkpp ] ) of little interest for numerical simulations of such systems .",
    "furthermore , the analytical method for the computation of moments is very awkward to transpose numerically , since it leads to an asymptotic series that eventually needs to be resummed .",
    "finally , it is not straightforward to generalize to models with spatial dimensions .      for the difficulties mentioned above with the poissonian state approach , we wish to take a different point of view on the evolution of the stochastic model .",
    "instead of performing a large-@xmath84 perturbative calculation directly of @xmath74 using field - theoretical methods , we try to characterize the shape of each realization of an evolution that starts with @xmath85 particles .",
    "what we mean by `` realization '' is a given path for @xmath56 generated by the stochastic evolution  ( [ evoln ] ) .",
    "it is useful to visualize a few such realizations : this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for @xmath86 , together with the solution to the mean field equation  ( [ mf ] ) .",
    "one sees that the curves that represent @xmath49 look like the solution to the mean - field equation  ( [ mf ] ) , but with the origin of times translated by some random @xmath87 .",
    "( the curves look also slightly noisy around the average trend , but the noise would be still much weaker for larger values of @xmath84 ) .",
    "this suggests that once there are `` enough '' particles in the system , say @xmath88 , the evolution becomes essentially deterministic .",
    "hence stochasticity only manifests itself in the initial stages of the evolution until @xmath89 , but in a crucial way : indeed , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , after averaging , @xmath74 is significantly different from @xmath90 , and this difference stems from rare realizations in which the particle number stays low for a long time . therefore , in individual realizations , stochasticity should be taken into account exactly as long as @xmath91 .",
    "fortunately , when the number of particles in the system is small compared to the maximum number of particles @xmath84 , the stochastic evolution is essentially governed by a linear equation which is not difficult to handle analytically .",
    "this heuristical discussion suggests that we may factorize the evolution in a linear stochastic evolution up to the time at which the number @xmath56 of particles in the system reaches @xmath92 , and continue through a nonlinear but deterministic equation , which is obtained from a mean field approximation to the evolution equation .",
    "as we will see , this simple observation leads to an elegant computation of @xmath74 that consistently agrees with the lowest order ( see eq .",
    "( [ borel ] ) ) derived in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us denote by @xmath93 the distribution of the times at which the number of particles in the system reaches @xmath92 and @xmath94 the conditional average number of particles at time @xmath43 given that there are @xmath95 particles in the system at time @xmath96 .",
    "one may write @xmath97 so far , this expression is exact .",
    "we now assume that the evolution is linear when @xmath98 and deterministic for @xmath99 .",
    "thus , in the previous equation , we replace @xmath93 by the solution @xmath100 of the linear problem obtained by setting @xmath45 and @xmath101 .",
    "furthermore , we approximate @xmath102 by the solution to the nonlinear evolution in the mean field approximation  ( [ mf ] ) over a time interval @xmath103 starting with @xmath104 particles at time @xmath96 , that we denote by @xmath105 . in these notations , we find the factorization @xmath106 note that for @xmath107 ( i.e. when there are less than @xmath104 particles in the system at the considered time @xmath43 ) , @xmath108 is like a backward evolution towards lower number of particles .",
    "this is not a problem since we then go back to the dilute regime , and the solution for @xmath109 in that regime is just obtained by taking the dilute limit of @xmath110 , given by the solution of the equation obtained from eq .",
    "( [ mf ] ) by dropping the nonlinear term .",
    "we claim that this factorization is valid whenever @xmath104 is large enough compared to 1 to justify the mean field approximation for the subsequent evolution , but , at the same time , @xmath104 is small compared to @xmath84 in such a way that the evolution up to @xmath104 be linear .",
    "let us express give explicit expressions for the different quantities that appear in eq .",

    "( [ mf ] ) reads @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",
    "it is also not difficult to show that @xmath113 solves the equation @xmath114 its solution may be found by standard generating function methods and takes the simple form @xmath115 in the limit of interest , that is for large @xmath92 and @xmath116 , it boils down to a gumbel distribution @xmath117 replacing eqs .",
    "( [ resmf ] ) and  ( [ reslin ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ procedure ] ) , we find @xmath118 since the gumbel distribution is strongly damped for @xmath119 ( by a factor @xmath120 ) , we may safely replace the lower limit of the integral by @xmath121 .",
    "finally , the change of variable @xmath122 brings the integral in the form ( [ borel ] ) .",
    "the result is independent of @xmath104 , as it should be , but in numerical applications , one should keep in mind that the limits @xmath123 have been assumed , and thus finite @xmath104 corrections must be expected .    in this picture ,",
    "the borel integral  ( [ borel ] ) has a transparent interpretation : the parameter @xmath124 is related to the factorization time @xmath96 , the exponential is the distribution of @xmath96 and the denominator corresponds to the mean - field part .",

    "finally , the matching of the forward and backward parts of the front is done by requiring that @xmath4 be a decreasing function of @xmath17 . in the case",
    "in which there is a number of particles larger than @xmath104 produced ahead of @xmath181 , then @xmath4 computed from the forward particles is larger than @xmath184 at @xmath181 : we choose to continue @xmath185 for @xmath186 until the point at which @xmath187 .",
    "note that with this prescription for the matching , the particle distribution in the forward part of the front is exact at all times , but the number of particles in the backward part is slightly overestimated on the average .",
    "other prescriptions may have been chosen : they would lead to similar quantitative results .",
    "one particular realization of the resulting front is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "we turn to the discussion of the numerical results for the mixed method .",
    "recall that the factorization scale @xmath104 has to be at the same time larger than 1 in such a way that mean field evolution starting from @xmath104 can be justified , and much smaller than @xmath84 so that nonlinear effects may be neglected .",
    "we choose @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "this means that the minimum value of @xmath84 for which we may solve the model using our method is of the order of @xmath190 for @xmath188 and @xmath191 for @xmath189 .",
    "we follow exactly the same procedure as in the fully stochastic case : we evolve the same initial condition over @xmath158 steps of time , with @xmath192 .",
    "the calculations of the velocity of the front are presented in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , they are compared to the results obtained by solving the exact model . we observe a perfect agreement for @xmath189 , at the level of @xmath171 . for @xmath188 ,",
    "the agreement is less good : the velocity is overestimated by about @xmath193 ( but this means a @xmath194 mismatch in the difference @xmath195 with the infinite-@xmath84 velocity ) .",
    "of course , a better agreement than that could not really be expected .",
    "however , part of the mismatch may also be related to the fact that our matching prescription between the dense and dilute regions leads to a slight overestimate of the number of particles in the lower part of the dense region , which has indeed the effect of increasing the front velocity .",
    "it may well be that for different models which do not have the requirement that @xmath4 be a decreasing function of @xmath17 , like qcd , the agreement would even be better .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath146 of the front is given in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] and displayed in fig .",
    "we also plot the theoretical formula  ( [ theoryd ] ) , to guide the eye .",
    "the numerical data seem to agree well with the asymptotic theoretical estimate  ( [ theoryd ] ) , but this must be accidental since for the considered values of @xmath84 , corrections are expected to be huge .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is a quantity that is much more difficult to measure numerically than the velocity , since it requires more statistics .",
    "our error bars are still of the order of 5 to 10% .",
    "we see however that the full stochastic model is very well reproduced , within errors , by the mixed model with @xmath189 . for @xmath188 instead , we notice that the fluctuations seem to be globally underestimated by up to 30% ( see tab .  [ tab1 ] ) . but",
    "this should be expected since our method consists in replacing part of the stochastic evolution by a mean field approximation .",
    ".[tab1]numerical results for the one - dimensional toy model .",
    "the velocity @xmath168 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath146 of the front are computed in the full stochastic model and in the two mixed models with factorization scales @xmath188 and @xmath189 respectively , for four different values of @xmath84 . [",

    "we have worked on specific toy models of noisy evolution of the fkpp type .",
    "we have proposed that , on an event - by - event basis , their evolution may be factorized into a linear stochastic part and a nonlinear deterministic part .",
    "we have shown on a zero - dimensional model that writing down this factorization leads to a straightforward computation of the average number of particles at leading order in @xmath196 , without having to go through the resummation of a divergent series like in more standard approaches @xcite .",
    "we have conjectured that such a factorization is also valid for one - dimensional models .",
    "in fact , this factorization had already been implicitly assumed in previous works in statistical physics , essentially for the purpose of performing numerical calculations for very large values of @xmath84 @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was even used to obtain analytical results for the front position , but only exponentially large values of @xmath84 were attainable .",
    "we have shown here that this factorization may be extended ( in practice numerically ) to lower values of @xmath84 , of the order of @xmath190 or @xmath191 .",
    "the only condition is the existence of a mesoscopic scale of particle numbers @xmath104 such that @xmath123 .",
    "we have tested the factorization in a model that we could also solve numerically , and have shown that it reproduces quite well the exact solution even for values of @xmath84 as low as 100 .",
    "of course , the dense - dilute factorization would be of no interest for numerical calculations at low values of @xmath84 in cases in which the complete underlying stochastic model were known  systems with 100 or 1000 particles may often be simulated quite easily . however ,",
    "as we have recalled in the introduction , the exact formulation of high energy qcd as a stochastic process ( if it exists ) has not been found yet .",
    "instead , we have a probabilistic rule for the evolution of the _ dipole number _ @xmath56 valid in the dilute regime of small amplitudes ( see eq .",
    "( [ dipoles ] ) ) , which has already been implemented numerically by salam @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and a mean - field equation for evolving the _ amplitude _ @xmath4 in the dense regime ( the balitsky - kovchegov equation @xcite , see eq .",
    "( [ bk ] ) ) . in our toy model ,",
    "the latter is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ evolt ] ) and the former is like the evolution rule for our system of particles . in addition , the relationship between @xmath56 and @xmath4 in the dilute regime is needed : it is provided by eq .",
    "( [ corresp ] ) in qcd , and has its equivalent ( eq .",
    "( [ t - n ] ) ) in the toy model of the previous section .",
    "consequently , the factorization proposed here should be very well suited for numerical computations of qcd scattering amplitudes at high energy : one should combine salam s dipole monte - carlo and a solution of the balitsky - kovchegov equation , in a way similar to what we have done here for the one - dimensional toy model .",
    "the details will be worked out in another publication @xcite .    extrapolating the results of our toy model study",
    ", we can expect to get reliable results for models in which the typical allowed number of particles @xmath84 is larger than @xmath190 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath197 in qcd , which is not far from the experimentally accessible window .",
    "hence the factorization procedure outlined here may be a good starting point for a realistic numerical investigation of qcd amplitudes near the unitarity limit .",
    "anyway , it is probably the best one could achieve without finding a realization of nonlinear saturation effects in the dipole model .",
    "needless to say , the toy model that we have studied here was tuned to make our factorization procedure as easy as possible to handle numerically .",
    "the many complications of qcd will make the implementation of this factorization a challenging issue .    at a more theoretical level",
    ", what our study suggests is that universal features show up already for quite low values of @xmath84 .",
    "this leaves us with the hope that the asymptotic analytical calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite could be extended to a wider range in @xmath84 .",
    "finally , we wish to comment on a recent proposal on how to address numerically the problem of qcd evolution at very high energies beyond the mean - field bk limit . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the idea that fluctuations could be obtained by solving a classical equation and then averaging over an ensemble of initial conditions was suggested , and was implemented numerically subsequently in ref .",
    "we note that the philosophy of this proposal is orthogonal to the one developed here : in our view , fluctuations in the saturation scale are due to intrinsic noise related to the discreteness of the number of partons , as is natural in reaction - diffusion processes .",
    "we do not think that the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite would work for reaction - diffusion at very large times ( i.e. asymptotic energies ) :",
    "for example , a universal distinctive feature of such processes is that the dispersion of the front positions ( i.e. saturation scales ) between different realizations ( i.e. events ) scales like @xmath198 , which can not be reproduced in the approach of refs .  @xcite .",
    "since our numerical method relies on the conjecture that qcd evolution is in the same universality class as reaction - diffusion processes , the two approaches would not lead to the same results for qcd observables ( see ref .",
    ". however , since the statement that there is a correspondence between qcd and reaction - diffusion is still a conjecture , one has to keep open to other possibilities .",
