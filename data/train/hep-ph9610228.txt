    "the quantity @xmath7 is an unknown uncertainty in the cross section due to higher order radiative corrections .",
    "a great attention was paid to this process during the last decades ( see review  @xcite and references therein ) . the born cross section with weak interactions taken into account and the first order qed radiative corrections to it were studied in detail  @xcite .",

    "so we will distinguish 16 kinematical regions : @xmath31 the matrix element module square summed over spin states in the regions ( [ eq6 ] ) is of the form of the born matrix element multiplied by the so  called collinear factors .",
