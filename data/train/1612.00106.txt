    "electric vehicles ( evs ) have several advantages over the traditional gasoline powered vehicles . for example , evs are more environment friendly and more energy efficient . realizing the above",
    ", regulators ( e.g. federal energy regulator commission ( ferc ) ) are providing incentives to the consumers to switch to electric vehicles .",
    "manufacturers ( e.g. tesla , nissan ) are increasingly developing evs equipped with superior technologies . as a result , electric vehicles",
    "are increasingly become popular .",
    "however , a wide deployment of evs requires an extensive network of charging stations which can be capable of charging large number of vehicles .",
    "vehicle - to - grid ( v2 g ) service has been proposed @xcite to enhance the profitability of the evs . in the v2 g service",
    ", evs can inject energies to the grid by discharging from their batteries .",
    "thus , this bidirectional power flow where evs can both charge and discharge has a lot of potential .",
    "hence , a lot of effort is going on for developing bidirectional evs@xcite .",
    "however , the higher amount of charging and discharging cycles will degrade the battery life . hence , the owners of the evs have to be compensated adequately for the v2 g service .",
    "thus , though a charging station can gain an additional profit using the v2 g service of the evs , however without a proper pricing mechanism , the owners of the evs will not prefer the v2 g service in the first place which may nullify the profit of the charging station .    without a proper control mechanism , the cost of the charging station and the peak energy consumption may increase . without a profitable charging station , the wide - scale deployment of the evs will remain a distant dream .",
    "the charging station needs to select prices in order to earn profits by allocating resources in an intelligent manner among the evs .",
    "the charging station also needs to provide adequate compensation to the owners if the ev is used for the v2 g service .",
    "however , high prices or low compensation may not provide incentives to the owners which may reduce the profit .",
    "hence , a proper pricing mechanism for charging the evs and the v2 g service is imperative for a charging station .",
    "we propose a menu based pricing scheme for charging an ev .",
    "whenever an ev arrives at the charging station , the charging station offers a variety of contracts @xmath0 to the ev s owner ( or , user ) at a price @xmath1 to the user where the user will be able to charge at least @xmath2 units of energy within the deadline @xmath3 for completion , and the battery usage will be limited to @xmath4 amount .",
    "the battery usage is the total amount of charging and discharging of the ev .",
    "the user either accepts one of the contracts by paying the specified price or rejects all of those based on its payoff .",
    "we assume that the user gets a utility for consuming @xmath2 amount of energy within the deadline @xmath3 .",
    "however , the user also has to incur a cost for battery utilization @xmath5 .",
    "the payoff of the user ( or , user s surplus ) for a contract is the difference between the utility and the sum of the cost incurred , and the price to be paid for the contract .",
    "the user will select the option which fetches the highest payoff .",
    "the various advantages of the above pricing scheme should be noted .",
    "first , it is an online pricing scheme .",
    "it can be adapted for each arriving user .",
    "second , since the charging station offers prices for different levels of charging required and the deadline , the charging station can prioritize one contract over the others depending on the energy resources available .",
    "third , the charging station also provides options of the maximum battery utilization to the users .",
    "the user who is not interested in the v2 g service is entitled to do that by selecting the contract with @xmath5 as @xmath6 .",
    "finally , the user s decision is much simplified .",
    "she only needs to select one of the contracts ( or , reject all ) .",
    "we consider that the charging station is equipped with renewable energy harvesting devices and a storage device for storing energies .",
    "the charging station may also buy conventional energy from the market to fulfill the contract of the user if required .",
    "hence , if a new user accepts the contract @xmath0 , a cost is incurred to the charging station .",
    "this cost may also depend on the existing evs and their resource requirements .",
    "a contract also specifies the maximum battery utilization which restricts the v2 g service generated from an ev .",
    "hence , the charging station needs to find the optimal cost for each contract .",
    "we show that obtaining the cost of fulfilling a contract is a _ linear programming _ problem .",
    "we also show that if a user accepts a contract with a higher battery utilization , the cost of the contract is lower ( lemma 1 ) .",
    "we consider two optimization problems ",
    "i ) social welfare maximization , and ii ) the ev charging station s profit maximization .",
    "we investigate the existence of a pricing mechanism which maximizes the ex - post social welfare , _",
    "i.e. _ , maximizes the social welfare for every possible realization of the utility function .",
    "we show that there exists such a pricing strategy .",
    "the pricing scheme is simple to compute , as the charging station selects a price which is equal to the marginal cost for fulfilling a certain contract for a new user ( theorem  [ thm : max_socv2 g ] ) .",
    "however , the above pricing scheme only provides _",
    "zero _ profit to the charging stations .",
    "thus , such a pricing scheme may not be useful to the charging station .",
    "we show that when a charging station is _ clairvoyant _",
    "( i.e. , the primary knows the utilities of the users ) , there exists a pricing scheme which satisfies both the objectives ( lemma  [ thm : profit_max ] ) .",
    "though in the above pricing mechanism , the user s surplus becomes @xmath6 .",
    "a _ clairvoyant _",
    "charging station may not be beneficial for the user s surplus .    in the scenario where the charging station does not know the exact utilities of the users ,",
    "we show that _ there may not exist a pricing strategy which simultaneously maximizes the ex - post social welfare and the expected profit_. one has to give away the ex - post social welfare maximization in order to achieve expected profit maximization .",
    "_ however , the user s surplus becomes higher compared to the clairvoyant scenario_. hence , an uncertainty of the utility enhances the user s surplus .",
    "we propose a pricing strategy which can fetch the highest possible profit to the charging station under the condition that it maximizes the ex - post social welfare ( theorem  [ thm : profitmax_uncertainty ] ) . above pricing strategy",
    "provides a _ worst case _ maximum profit to the charging station . since the above pricing strategy may not yield the",
    "_ maximum expected _ profit to the charging station , we have to relax the constraint the social welfare to be maximized in order to yield a higher profit to the charging station .",
    "whether a contract will be selected by the user does not depend on the price of the contract , but also , the prices of other contracts .",
    "thus , achieving a pricing scheme which maximizes the expected profit is difficult because of the discontinuous nature of the profits .",
    "we propose a pricing strategy which yields a fixed ( say @xmath7 ) amount of profit to the charging station .",
    "further , we show that a suitable choice of @xmath7 can maximize the profit of the charging station for a class of utility functions ( theorem  [ thm : aclassutility ] ) .    in section  [ sec : v2g_profitability ]",
    "we characterize the conditions which will yield higher profits to the charging station in the v2 g service .",
    "we show that if the conventional energy price is high , the charging station selects more preferable prices for enticing v2 g services if the renewable energy harvested is low . when the charging station s storage capacity is low and the renewable energy harvesting is low , the user s incentives for the v2 g service also increases .",
    "the v2 g service also increases the profit of the charging station .",
    "finally , we , empirically provide insights how a trade - off between the profit of the charging station and the social welfare can be achieved for various pricing schemes ( section  [ sec : simulation_results ] ) .",
    "our numerical analysis shows that both the user s surplus and the charging station s profit increase with the v2 g service . the energy consumption during the peak period decreases as users provide more v2 g services during the peak period .",
    "charging schedule for evs using price signals for _ unidirectional _ service have been considered@xcite .",
    "the above papers did not consider the optimal discharging schedule of the evs as these papers only considered unidirectional power flow . as a result",
    ", these paper did not consider the battery degradation cost incurred in the v2 g service .",
    "few papers considered the _ bidirectional _ power flow @xcite . however , their focus was scheduling of the charging and discharging pattern of the evs , rather than the pricing aspects .",
    "naturally , these papers did not consider whether users will prefer the amount of battery degradation found in the optimal scheduling process .",
    "the social welfare maximizing and profit maximizing prices are also not considered .",
    "@xcite considered the optimal pricing to the evs in a day - ahead setting for residential charging .",
    "the users control the charging and discharging pattern at each instance for the price selected by the aggregator in a pre - specified manner .",
    "however , the users can arrive randomly in the charging station , the charging station needs to select a price for each arriving user using an online algorithm .",
    "the users can not control the charging and discharging schedule at each instance in the charging station . compared to _ all _ the above papers , in our approach , the charging station specifies the amount of battery utilization for each contract .",
    "the charging station also selects prices for different deadlines in our approach . hence , the user can now choose its own deadline and can specify the v2 g service it is willing to commit based on its own need .",
    "deadline differentiated prices have been considered @xcite . in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we also considered a menu - based pricing scheme where the charging station provides prices for different deadlines and prices to the new user .",
    "however , the above papers did not consider the _ bidirectional _ power flow problem .",
    "thus , in this setting the charging station now also needs to select different prices for different amounts of battery utilization .",
    "_ to the best of our knowledge , this is the first attempt to consider menu - based pricing which considered the bidirectional power flow from the evs . _",
    "further , this is the first work that incentivizes the users to participate in the v2 g service by finding optimal prices for different amounts of battery degradation while maximizing the social welfare or profit of the charging station .",
    "we consider that evs arrive throughout a day at the charging station for charging .",
    "suppose that the user @xmath8 arrives at time @xmath9 . the job of the charging station is to select a price for charging in order to maximize the profit .",
    "we consider a vehicle - to - grid ( v2 g ) service where electric vehicles ( evs ) can feed back stored power to the grid .",
    "specifically , the energy can be discharged from the batteries of the evs . however , the ev batteries have fixed number of charging - discharging cycles @xcite . when the battery is used for feeding back energy to the grid",
    ", the battery wear cost may be significant .",
    "thus , the users may want to limit the battery utilization as low as possible .",
    "we consider that a charging station wants to maximize its profit over a certain time period ( e.g. over a day ) .",
    "it will offer a menu - based price contract @xmath10 for contract @xmath0 to the user @xmath8 which arrives at time @xmath9 in the charging station ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ev_charging ] ) .",
    "if the user selects the menu @xmath0 , then , the user @xmath8 will be able to charge @xmath2 amount of energy at most within the deadline @xmath3 and the maximum amount of _ additional _ battery utilization ( definition 1 ) is restricted to @xmath5 .",
    "the deadline @xmath3 denotes that the user has to leave by time @xmath3 , after which the ev will not be able to charge .",
    "first , we describe the constraints the charging station has to satisfy the contract @xmath11 for the user @xmath8 .",
    "* charging / discharging rate * : let @xmath12 be the amount of energy provided to ( or , discharged from ) the ev @xmath8 during time @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 indicates that the ev @xmath8 is charged and @xmath15 indicates that energy is discharged from the ev @xmath8 during time @xmath13 .",
    "also note that there is an initial set @xmath16 of existing evs .",
    "vehicle @xmath17 requires additional @xmath18 amount of energy within the deadline @xmath19 .",
    "the charging and discharging efficiency of the ev @xmath8 is denoted as @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "note that @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the positive part of @xmath12 ( it denotes that the electric vehicle @xmath8 is charged during time @xmath13 ) and @xmath24 denotes the negative part of @xmath12 ( it denotes the amount discharged from ev @xmath8 during time @xmath13 ) .",
    "hence , the following set of constraints must be satisfied @xmath25 @xmath26 indicates the total amount of energy required for charging and @xmath27 indicates the total amount of energy used when evs discharge during time @xmath13 .",
    "note that an ev can not simultaneously charge and discharge , hence , we must have @xmath28 for all @xmath29 and @xmath3 . _",
    "later we will show in theorem  [ thm : noposinegative ] that in an optimal solution @xmath28 though we have not explicitly considered the above constraint in the system .",

    "the charging station also can buy energies from the conventional market .",

    "the charging efficiency and discharge efficiency of the battery of the charging station is considered to be @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath48 note that our model can also incorporate the scenario where the batteries have some static leakage rate i.e. the battery level decreases with time .",
    "* energy to and from the grid * : let the amount the charging station buys from the conventional market and sells to the grid as @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively for time @xmath13 ( fig :  [ fig : hybrid_v2 g ] ) .",
    "hence , we have @xmath51 since @xmath44 is the negative of @xmath43 , thus , we can represent the above constraint in the following @xmath52 we also must have @xmath53 since the battery of the charging station should not charge or discharge at the same time . though we have not explicitly considered the above constraint , however , we show that in an optimal solution in theorem  [ thm : noposinegative ] , we always have @xmath53 .",
    "note that the constraints in ( [ eq : battery_capacity ] ) and ( [ eq : storage ] ) also specify the bound on the amount of charging and discharging from the evs .",
    "the amount of charging can not exceed the total amount of stored energy in the battery and the energy bought from the grid .",
    "the stored energy depends on the harvested renewable energy , energy charged to the evs and discharged from the evs , energy bought and energy sold to the grid .",
    "[ fig : hybrid_v2 g ] depicts various system parameters .",
    "* maximum battery utilization * in the vehicle - to - grid ( v2 g ) service , frequent charging and discharging may reduce the lifecycle of the battery of an ev .",

    "we define a metric which will model the total maximum utilization of the battery of an ev .",
    "battery utilization is defined as the absolute value of the difference between the battery levels at two subsequent time intervals .",
    "hence , if the deadline is @xmath54 for user @xmath8 , then the total battery utilization for user @xmath8 is @xmath55 .",
    "the battery utilization defines the total level of charging and discharging has been done . if the ev @xmath8 is used only for charging , then @xmath56 . in a contract @xmath57",
    ", the battery of ev needs a charging amount of @xmath2 , and thus , the total battery utilization has to be at least @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the contract @xmath11 where @xmath58 denotes the _ additional battery utilization _ apart from the charging amount @xmath2 specified by the contract .",
    "we denote @xmath5 as the maximum _ additional _ battery utilization with slight abuse of notation .",
    "specifically , in the contract @xmath11 , the maximum utilization is restricted to @xmath4 for user @xmath8 .",

    "suppose the maximum utilization remaining for an existing user @xmath17 at time @xmath9 is @xmath59 .",
    "thus , if the user @xmath8 selects the contract @xmath11 , the constraint that the charging station has to satisfy is @xmath60 the above constraint is not linear . in the following",
    "we reduce it in a linear form .",
    "note from ( [ eq : dischargelimit ] ) that @xmath61since @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the positive and negative parts of @xmath37 , thus , @xmath64 .",
    "hence , the expression in ( [ eq : bu ] ) becomes @xmath65 note that we must have @xmath28 .",
    "we show in theorem  [ thm : noposinegative ] that this is indeed true in an optimal solution .",

    "we consider that the charging station is myopic or near - sighted i.e. , it selects its price for user @xmath8 without considering the future arrival process of the vehicles .",
    "however , it will consider the cost incurred to charge the existing evs .",
    "note that as the number of existing users increases , the marginal cost can increase to fulfill a contract for an arriving user , hence , such a pricing strategy may not maximize the payoff in a long run .",
    "note that , _ a myopic pricing strategy is optimal in the case the marginal cost of fulfilling a demand of a new user is independent of the number of existing users .",
    "_    in practice , the charging station often has fixed number of charging spots .",
    "thus , the charging station may want to select high prices for user @xmath8 , in order to make the charging spots available for the users who can pay more but only will arrive in future . hence , considering the future arrival process of the vehicles may increase the profit of the charging station",
    ". however , such a pricing strategy is against the first come first serve basis which is the current norm for charging vehicles .",
    "our approach can be seen as a fair allocation process , where the charging station serves users based on the first come first serve basis .",
    "the optimal cost for the charging station to fulfill the contract @xmath57 to the user @xmath8 is thus @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the per unit cost of buying energy from the grid and @xmath82 is the per unit cost of selling energy to the grid . note that our model can also incorporate time varying , strictly increasing convex costs @xmath83 or concave prices @xmath84.we assume that @xmath85 in order to avoid arbitrage opportunity .",
    "however , the above cost structures will destroy the properties of the linear programming .",
    "our model can be easily extended to the setting where there are upper bounds on @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the problem will still be a linear programming problem .",
    "the cost @xmath81 and the price @xmath82 are assumed to be known . in case they change in a dynamic manner i.e. , they are real time prices , we consider that @xmath81 is the expected cost , and @xmath82 is the expected price .",
    "note that the above problem is a linear programing problem ( similar to the setting considered in @xcite ) and thus , it is easy to solve .",
    "however , the number of constraints are hugher compared to @xcite as we consider the v2 g service .    in the following theorem",
    ", we show that the optimal cost to the charging station given in ( 12 ) , @xmath86 and @xmath53 for all @xmath3 , and @xmath87 .",

    "_ proof _ : see appendix  [ sec : proof_thmnoposinegative ] .",
    "the above theorem shows that in an optimal solution , neither the ev nor the battery of the charging station simultaneously charge and discharge .",
    "now we calculate the _ additional _ cost imposed to the charging station for fulfilling the new contract .",
    "first , we introduce some notations which we use throughout .",
    "[ defn : vlt ] the charging station has to incur the cost @xmath90 for serving the existing users and the contract @xmath11 for the new user @xmath8 where @xmath90 is the value of the linear optimization problem @xmath88 .",

    "@xmath93 is the value of that optimization problem . from definitions  [ defn : vlt ] and [ defn : v - k ]",
    "we can visualize @xmath95 as the additional cost or marginal cost to the charging station when the user @xmath8 accepts the price menu @xmath96 .",
    "we assume that the prediction @xmath97 is perfect for all future times and is known to the charging station .",
    "however , menu - based pricing approach can be extended to the setting where the estimated generation does not match the exact amount .",
    "first , we can consider a conservative approach where @xmath42 can be treated as the worst possible renewable energy generation . as a second approach",
    ", we can accumulate various possible scenarios of the renewable energy generations , and try to find the cost to fulfill a contract for each such scenario .",
    "for example , if there are @xmath98 number of possible instances of the renewable energy generation amount in future .",
    "then , we can find the optimal cost for each such instance of renewable energy generation @xmath99 where @xmath100 instead of @xmath42 .",
    "we then can compute the average ( or , the weighted average , if some instance has greater probability ) of the optimal costs , and that cost can be taken as the cost of fulfilling a certain contract .",

    "thus , the above result follows .    since the charging station can sell some energies taken from the evs , the cost of fulfilling the contract @xmath0 will be lower as @xmath5 will increase .",

    "if the user does not select any of the menus , then the charging station gets @xmath6 profit .",
    "thus , the expected profit of the charging station is @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the probability of the event that the menu @xmath0 is accepted by the user @xmath8 . note from ( [ eq : profitmax_expec ] ) that the profit maximization is a difficult problem as the menu selected by an user inherently depends on the prices selected for other menus .",
    "for example , if the price selected for a particular contract is high , the user will be reluctant to take that as compared to a lower price one .",
    "the profit is a discontinuous function of the prices and thus , the problem may not be convex even when the marginal distribution of the utilities are concave .",
    "we consider that the charging station decides the price menus in order to fulfill one of the two objectives ( or , both) i ) social welfare maximization and ii ) its profit maximization .",
    "the social welfare is the sum of user surplus and the profit of the charging station .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : userutility ] for a certain realized values @xmath67 if the user @xmath8 selects the price menu @xmath10 , then its surplus is @xmath68 , otherwise it is @xmath6 .    as discussed in section",
    "[ sec : profit ] the profit of the charging station is @xmath111 for a given price @xmath10 if the user selects the menu , and it is @xmath6 otherwise .",

    "since the charging station is unaware of the utilities of the users , the charging station has two choices - i ) decides a price and hopes that it will maximize the social welfare for the realized values of utilities ( _ ex - post _ maximization ) , or ii ) decides a price and hopes that it will maximize the social welfare in an expected sense ( _ ex - ante _ maximization ) .",
    "thus , the _ ex - ante _ maximization does not guarantee that the social welfare will be maximized for every realization of the random variables @xmath115 .",
    "however , in the _ ex - post _ maximization , the social welfare is maximized for each possible realization of the random variables .",

    "note that _ ex - post _ social welfare maximization is the same as ( [ eq : socialwelfare_maxproblem ] ) .",
    "social welfare maximization does not guarantee that the charging station may get a positive profit .",
    "it is important for the wide scale deployment of the charging stations that the charging station must have some profit .",
