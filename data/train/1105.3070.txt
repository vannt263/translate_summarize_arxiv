    "for this problem , c. webster and a. winchester @xcite gave geometric conditions which determine whether or not every point on the metric boundary of a graph with the standard path metric is a busemann point , and an example of a graph which admits non - busemann points in its metric boundary .",

    "the thurston s lipscthiz metric is the length spectrum asymmetric metric with respect to the hyperbolic lengths of simple closed curves , meanwhile the teichmller distance is recognized as the length spectrum metric with respect to the extremal lengths of simple closed curves via kerckhoff s formula ( cf . .",

    "since hyperbolic lengths and extremal lengths are fundamental geometric quantities in the teichmller theory , it is natural to compare properties of these two distances .",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we recall the definitions and properties of ingredients in the teichmller theory , including the extremal length and the teichmller distance . in  3 , we discuss the metric boundaries of metric spaces , and check that any almost geodesic converges in the gardiner - masur compactification .",
    "though this convergence follows from properties of the metric boundary and liu and su s work in @xcite , we shall give a simple proof of the convergence from the teichmller theory for the completeness of readers .",
    "we treat measured foliations whose projective classes are the limits of almost geodesics in  4 and  5 .",
    "indeed , in  5 , we will observe that when a measured foliation whose projective class is the limit of an almost geodesic has a foliated annulus as its component , any simple closed curve is not so _ twisted _ in the characteristic annulus corresponding to the foliated annulus through the almost geodesic ( cf .",
    "lemma [ lem : twisting_number ] ) .",
    "this is a key for getting our result . in  6",

    ", it suffices to construct a suitable annulus @xmath301 on @xmath229 whose core is homotopic to @xmath333 .",
    "the procedure given here is originally due to s. kerckhoff in @xcite , when a given almost geodesic @xmath156 is actually a geodesic ( see also  9 of @xcite ) .",
    "we briefly recall the case when @xmath156 is a geodesic .",
    "we first cut each characteristic annuli @xmath292 of @xmath230 into @xmath305-congruent horizontal rectangles .",
    "the annulus @xmath301 is made by composing appropriately such ( slightly modified ) @xmath334-congruent horizontal rectangles and ties ( quadrilaterals ) in @xmath287 ( cf . ) .",
    "we can take such ties with uniform extremal length ( cf .",
    "claim [ claim : b_s ] ) .",
    "then , by applying proposition [ prop : extremal_length_upper ] , we obtain an upper bound of the extremal length of @xmath301 .",
    "one of the essential reason why we can get an appropriate upper bound in the case above is that , through the teichmller ray associated to the projective class of @xmath335 , there are  no \" twisting deformation along @xmath284 on the characteristic annulus , because the teichmller deformation is done by stretching in the horizontal and vertical directions .",
    "indeed , the major part of the upper bound comes from the extremal length of congruent rectangles ( cf . ) .",
    "the ` no - twisting ' property implies that the totality of the extremal lengths of such rectangles is equal to the major part of the lower estimate ( cf . ) .    in the case",
    "when @xmath156 is an almost geodesic , we have already observed in that @xmath56 is not so twisted on the characteristic annuli too much .",
    "hence , we can apply the similar argument for getting an appropriate upper bound of @xmath336 .",
    "since @xmath22 is maximal , any component @xmath289 ( @xmath338 ) of @xmath287 is one of the three types : a pair of pants , an annulus with one distinguished point ( a singularity of angle @xmath339 or a flat point ) , or a half - pillow with two cone singularities of angle @xmath339 ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : pants ] ) . in the the case when @xmath289 is either an annulus or a half - pillow , we can deal with the same manner , and",
    "hence we now assume that @xmath289 is a pair of pants .",
    "notice from that the length of any component of @xmath340 is of order @xmath286 with respect to the metric @xmath341 . for simplifying of the notation",
    ", we assume that components of @xmath340 are @xmath342 , @xmath343 , and @xmath344 .",
    "then , the critical graph @xmath345 forms one of the graph in figure [ fig : pants ] ( cf .",

    "let @xmath352 be a subannulus of @xmath350 with height @xmath353 and @xmath354 .",
    "we cut @xmath352 along the vertical slits with endpoints in the @xmath346-cuts in @xmath347 and get a family of euclidean rectangles .",
    "since the circumference and the height of @xmath352 are of order @xmath355 , the moduli of such euclidean rectangles are uniformly bounded above and below .",
    "* @xmath358 is a rectangle above for all @xmath359 and @xmath360 , * the arc system given by correcting cores of @xmath361 s is homotopic to @xmath362 , where the _ core _ of @xmath361 is a path in @xmath363 connecting between facing arcs in @xmath364 and * the extremal length of family of paths in @xmath361 homotopic to the core is uniformly bounded above .    notice from and the uniformity the moduli of @xmath365 that the conformal structure of @xmath289 is precompact in the reduced teichmller space .",
    "since the intersection numbers @xmath366 are independent of @xmath209 , we can take @xmath361 such that the width of each @xmath361 with respect to the @xmath245-metric are comparable with @xmath286 . by definition ,",

    "we divide each @xmath292 into congruence @xmath305-rectangles @xmath371 via proper horizontal segments .",
    "we may assume that for any @xmath360 and @xmath372 , there is an @xmath359 such that @xmath373 is congruent to @xmath374 .",
    "we set @xmath375 ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : annulusr ] ) .      since twisting numbers of segments in @xmath321 on each @xmath292 are at most one for all @xmath326 , from and the dehn - thurston s parametrization of simple closed curves ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , we can glue all @xmath292 and @xmath287 appropriately at the part @xmath377 to get a riemann surface @xmath378 and an annulus @xmath379 such that after deforming @xmath378 by a quasiconformal mapping with maximal dilatation @xmath380 , we obtain @xmath229 and the core of the image @xmath301 of the annulus @xmath381 is homotopic to @xmath333 .",
