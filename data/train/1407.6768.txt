    "the concept of maxwell s demon has introduced a deep relationship between information theory and thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "as originally proposed , the demon can be thought as a microscopic `` intelligent '' being capable of extracting work from a thermodynamic system at apparent no energy cost . as a simple example , consider a gas ( initially in an equilibrium thermal state ) contained in a chamber divided into two parts by an insulated wall . by direct inspection",
    "( followed by a post - selection ) of fast particles , the demon would then be able to create a temperature gradient between the two parts , which could be used , e.g. , as an energy resource for a thermal machine .",
    "naturally , in order to provide a continuous work extraction , a cyclic process must be required , which imposes the erasure of the demon s memory for a complete thermodynamic accounting .",
    "indeed , the irreversibility of the erasure operation , which is the main content of the landauer principle  @xcite , is the ultimate reason responsible for the conciliation of the maxwell s demon with the second law of thermodynamics .    in a modern perspective , we can take a maxwell s demon as any device with the ability of information processing ( as a computer modeled by a turing machine ) , where the extraction of work comes at the only cost of memory erasure at the end of the process .",
    "remarkably , it has been shown by zurek in ref .",
    "@xcite that a quantum demon , which has the ability of implementing a quantum conditional dynamics through global operations over the system , can be more efficient in extracting work of a quantum system than any classical demon , which acts through local operations and classical communication to implement a classical dynamics . in a bipartite system - apparatus scenario ,",
    "this difference can be quantified by the amount of quantum correlations between system and apparatus , as measured by a thermal version of the quantum discord ( qd )  @xcite .",
    "indeed , qd has been identified as a general resource in quantum information protocols ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "moreover , remarkable applications of qd have also been found in the characterization of quantum phase transitions  @xcite and in the description of quantum dynamics under decoherence  @xcite . in this context ,",
    "an operational interpretation of the qd in terms of the efficiency of a maxwell s demon establishes a solid framework to investigate its conceptual role in quantum thermodynamics as well as to inspire new qd - based quantum protocols .    in this work",
    ", we aim at investigating the efficiency of both classical and quantum maxwell s demons in the multipartite scenario .",
    "in particular , we are interested in analyzing the relationship between the quantum advantage and the existence of multipartite quantum correlations . more specifically , provided @xmath0 copies of an @xmath0-partite system @xmath1 , we introduce a protocol of work extraction defined through a sequence of intermediate steps , where the maxwell demon ( either classical or quantum ) uses a subsystem @xmath2 of copy @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) as a measurement apparatus at a each step , with @xmath3 a sequential label chosen at demon s will .",
    "the demon is also required to erase its memory at the end of the process , so that the thermodynamic accounting does not disregard the irreversible local cost of erasure . in this context",
    ", we will show that the advantage of the quantum demon over its classical counterpart in extracting work ( from the @xmath0 copies ) is bounded through the amount of multipartite quantum correlation , as measured by a thermal version of the global quantum discord ( gqd )  @xcite .",

    "moreover , we also provide examples of work extraction via mixed multipartite states .",
