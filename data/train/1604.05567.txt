    "nonlinearity is important in many structural dynamic applications that are of interest to engineers , for example in structures with bolted interfaces @xcite , machinery with rubber isolation mounts , microsystems subjected to thermal , magnetic or friction forces @xcite , and biomechanical systems @xcite . in other cases",
    "the baseline structure is linear , but its performance can be enhanced by adding or engineering certain types of nonlinearities @xcite . however , nonlinear dynamics is a rich and complicated field and so engineers tend instead to ignore nonlinearity or to seek a linear model that approximates the system at the forcing level of interest @xcite .",
    "vibration modes form the foundation of our understanding of linear dynamic systems , and influence efforts related to testing , modeling , validating and controller design .",
    "rosenberg @xcite extended modal analysis to nonlinear systems in the 1960 s , coining the phrase nonlinear normal mode ( nnm ) .",
    "the area received new attention in the 1990 s @xcite and now it is clear that nnms can be used to obtain a wealth of insight into the response of a nonlinear system @xcite .",
    "for example , nnms have been used to explain internally resonant and non - resonant motions of structures @xcite , to design a nonlinear vibration absorber ( also called a nonlinear energy sink ) @xcite , to create or validate a reduced order model for a system @xcite , and to explain changes in the oscillation frequency and the deformation shape of the free and forced response of a structure @xcite .    in recent years important",
    "progress has been made in the numerical calculation of undamped @xcite and damped nnms @xcite .",
    "these new algorithms have been used to compute the nonlinear modes of a geometrically nonlinear finite element model of a component from a diesel exhaust system , a full - scale aircraft , a bladed disk from a turbine and a strongly nonlinear satellite in @xcite , respectively . a framework for experimental identification of nnms",
    "was recently presented in @xcite and validated on an academic structure @xcite .",
    "more recent works have begun to use this framework on more complicated structures @xcite .",
    "one fundamental property of undamped nnms is the fact that they can be realized when a harmonic forcing function cancels the damping force in the damped system @xcite . as a result",
    ", they form the backbone of the nonlinear forced response ( nlfr ) curves @xcite and hence they approximate the oscillation frequency and deformation shape that are exhibited at resonance , when a structure is at the greatest risk of failure .",
    "the relationship between the nlfr and the nnm backbone is simple for mild nonlinearities , but most realistic systems exhibit complicated nnms with many interactions between the various modes leading to internally resonant branches .",
    "many works have explored interactions between nonlinear modes with commensurate linear frequencies , e.g. , when a pair of the linearized natural frequencies of the system have an integer ratio @xcite .",
    "some of them have even exploited these modal interactions for optimal design @xcite .",
    "in contrast , only a few have considered the case that is of interest in this work where the modal interactions occur between pairs of modes whose linear frequencies are not integer related .",
    "the investigation of such interactions requires one to resort to computational methods , which is another specific aspect of this study .",
    "this work explores the relationships between these interacting nnms and the forced response of the nonlinear system , especially for the case in which the forced response shows an isolated resonance curve ( irc ) .",
    "specifically , we show that the interactions between nnms are responsible for the ircs in the forced response .",
    "we note that the paper @xcite discusses the relationships between bifurcations of backbone curves and ircs ; it is therefore the ideal companion of the present study .",
    "these detached families of solutions are frequently not detected because they do not emerge naturally from the fundamental response when numerical continuation is used .",
    "they can lie outside or inside the main resonance curve @xcite , with the former case typically being more important because one is likely to underestimate the response of the nonlinear system @xcite .",
    "isolated resonances may also go undetected during laboratory experiments when stepped / swept sine testing is employed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ periodic ] briefly reviews the methodology used to compute the periodic motions of the undamped and damped form of the nonlinear equations of motion , along with a phase resonance condition extended to nonlinear systems .",
    "an adaptation of the energy balancing procedure presented by neild et al .",
    "@xcite , which can be used to estimate the forcing amplitude required to isolate the nnm , is also presented in section [ periodic ] .",
    "section  [ nnmsec ] applies the energy balancing technique to a nonlinear cantilever beam with the aim to predict the resonances from the knowledge of the nnms and of the damping matrix .",
    "the predictions of section  [ nnmsec ] are validated using the computation of nlfrs and bifurcation tracking in section  [ nlfrsec ] .",
    "section  [ sec5 ] discusses the practical implications of ircs by computing the beam response to sine sweep excitations of increasing amplitudes .",
    "the conclusions of the present study are presented in section  [ sec_future ] .",
    "the @xmath2-degree - of - freedom ( dof ) equations of motion for a nonlinear system generally can be written as @xmath3    the @xmath4 matrices @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 represent the mass , damping and stiffness matrices , respectively .",
    "the displacement , velocity and acceleration are represented with the @xmath8 vectors @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , and the external loads are applied through the @xmath8 force vector @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath8 nonlinear restoring force vector , @xmath13 , accounts for the nonlinearities in the physical system .",
    "we only consider the case where the nonlinear restoring force depends on displacement .",
    "the nnms calculated in this study are defined as _ not necessarily synchronous periodic motions of the undamped and unforced nonlinear system _ @xcite .",
    "a variety of methods exist to find these periodic solutions , e.g. , perturbation techniques @xcite and harmonic balance @xcite . in this paper , nnms",
    "are computed using the shooting technique combined with numerical continuation @xcite .",
    "the outcome of the calculations is a frequency - energy plane which depicts the evolution of the fundamental frequency of the nnm as the energy changes .",
    "nonlinear forced responses ( nlfrs ) , i.e. , the periodic responses of the damped system to a monoharmonic excitation force @xmath14 are also calculated herein using shooting and numerical continuation  @xcite .",
    "nlfrs can reveal new phenomena that can not be observed with linear theory , such as frequency - energy dependence , subharmonic and superharmonic resonances , coexisting solutions , and stable / unstable periodic motions .",
    "the first theoretical connection between nlfrs and nnms can be derived thanks to the nonlinear phase lag quadrature criterion @xcite .",
    "specifically , the damped system can be made to respond in a single nnm motion if the excitation exactly cancels out the damping force . to this end , a multi - point , multi - harmonic excitation is to be applied to the system so that the harmonics of the response are all in quadrature with the harmonics of the excitation .    in practice , it is unlikely that the forcing of interest will exactly cancel damping as outlined above , because this requires that the force be distributed in space and that it be comprised of many harmonics . a few studies @xcite have shown that an accurate approximation to the nnm can be obtained by a much simpler force that excites resonance .",
    "for example , peeters et al .",
    "@xcite explored whether a single - point , monoharmonic excitation could approximately isolate an nnm , and found good results in simulations and experiment with a lightly damped beam . in their efforts",
    "it was helpful to define a multi - harmonic mode indicator function ( mif ) which indicates when the 90 degrees phase lag condition has been obtained . when a single - point sinusoidal force is applied to the nonlinear structure , which is the case considered in this paper ,",
    "the mif is defined as follows @xmath15 where the operator @xmath16 represents the complex conjugate transpose and @xmath17 is the complex fourier coefficient of the fundamental harmonic of the computed nlfr .",
    "the mif in eq .",
    "( [ mif ] ) indicates that resonance occurs when @xmath18 is equal to one .",
    "the relationship between nlfrs and nnms was also studied using an energy balancing technique in @xcite .",
    "based on the second - order normal form theory , the analytical developments hold for weakly nonlinear regimes of motion . this technique is slightly revisited herein by employing a numerical viewpoint , which allows one to consider more strongly nonlinear regimes .",
    "let us first consider a linear system . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "if the system is oscillating in a linear normal mode denoted as @xmath19 , then the damping forces instantaneously exert a distributed force @xmath20 and the power dissipated at any instant is @xmath21 and the total energy dissipated over one cycle is @xmath22 similarly , an arbitrary forcing function @xmath12 inputs energy into the system as @xmath23 at resonance , the energy dissipated by the damping forces must match the total energy input to the system over the period @xmath24 .",
    "the balance is enforced by setting @xmath25 @xcite . for a single - point ,",
    "monoharmonic force with amplitude @xmath26 , the scaling on @xmath26 can be computed by satisfying @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a vector of zeros with a value of one at the location @xmath29 , which is the point at which the force is applied .",
    "this energy balancing criterion is a useful result , because it enables the practitioner to establish formally the direct link from the computed linear normal modes , i.e. , the periodic motions of the undamped , unforced system , to the resonant response of the damped forced system .",
    "the energy balance , @xmath25 , also holds for nonlinear systems .",
    "so , if both the nnms @xmath19 and the damping @xmath6 in the system are known , eq .",
    "( [ puissancereactive ] ) can be readily used to estimate the forcing amplitude @xmath26 that would excite the system at resonance with associated motion @xmath19 . while it is common practice to excite a system using a monoharmonic force",
    ", one should note that higher harmonics might be necessary to achieve a reasonable approximation to the nnm motion , especially near internal resonances , so any calculations based on eq .",
    "( [ puissancereactive ] ) should be regarded as approximate .",
    "in the present and next sections , a model of a cantilevered beam with a cubic nonlinear spring attached at the beam tip is used to investigate the connection between nnms and nlfrs .",
    "the beam was 0.7 m in length , with a width and thickness of 0.014 m , and was constructed of structural steel with a young s modulus of 205 gpa and a density of 7800 kg / m@xmath30 .",
    "a schematic of the fea model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . a linear finite element model of the planar beam was created in abaqus using 20 b31 euler - bernoulli beam elements , giving it a total of 60 dof .",
    "a mass and stiffness proportional damping model was used , defining the damping matrix as @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "these parameters were chosen such that the damping ratios of the first and second linear modes were 1% and 5% , respectively .",
    "the cubic nonlinear spring had a coefficient of @xmath34 , and was attached at the beam tip affecting only the transverse direction .",
    "( a)).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the fold bifurcation tracking analysis was also used to study the effect of structural damping on the observed ircs . the damping matrix introduced in section  [ nnmsec ]",
    "was perturbed by adding a scaling term , @xmath35 , such that @xmath36 .",
    "several bifurcation branches are given in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] for different values of @xmath35 , namely 1 , 1.5 , 1.8 and 1.9 .",
    "the irc was robust against damping since it was still visible for higher levels of damping ( @xmath37 ) , however , increasing @xmath35 caused the irc to appear later in forcing amplitude , and shorten the range where it existed .",
    "for the largest damping case studied , for @xmath38 , the irc was no longer present .",
    "this analysis shows that a sufficiently large value of structural damping can destroy the ircs .",
    "it may also explain why the other modal interactions in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) did not produce ircs .",
    "= 1 , 1.5 , 1.8 and 1.9 , respectively .",
    "the diamond and square markers indicate the apparition and the merging of the irc , respectively.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]",
    "to better understand the practical implications of ircs , the beam was subjected to sine sweep excitations of increasing amplitudes with a sweep rate of 0.5 hz / s .",
    "the outcome of the numerical simulations is plotted in figure [ fig5 ] . for reference ,",
    "the response of the linear model at a force amplitude of @xmath26 = 4.45 n ( black ) was computed , and resulted in the largest tip displacement ( even though the force amplitude was lowest ) , with a resonance at the linear natural frequency .    for the nonlinear sweep for @xmath26 = 11.3 n , resonance occurred near 37 hz , resulting in a sudden jump , the so - called jump phenomenon , to a lower response amplitude as the frequency continued to sweep upwards . when the force amplitude doubled , the resonant frequency occurred near 39 hz . however , doubling the force amplitude once more ( @xmath26 = 45.2 n ) caused a dramatic shift in resonant frequency .",
    "now the response dropped off around 57 hz , indicating that the increased force amplitude shifted the resonance nearly 18 hz . considering the amplitudes @xmath26 = 32.5 n and 35.6 n shows that the shift in resonant frequency occurred in this range of forcing amplitudes .",
    "in other words , the sine sweeps at @xmath26 = 22.6 n , @xmath26 = 26.7 n and @xmath26 = 32.5 n fell off around 38 hz , because the irc was disconnected from the main branch , and there was no path for the response to follow to the higher frequency resonance",
    ". however , once the two nlfr branches merged together ( @xmath26 = 35.6 n ) , the sine sweeps were able to stay along the high amplitude path up to resonance around 55 hz .            another dynamical phenomenon , which only appeared for @xmath26 = 35.6 n and 45.2 n , is the modulation of the signal s envelope in the range of 40 - 45 hz .",
    "it was further examined by monitoring fold and neimark - sacker bifurcations  @xcite along the nlfr .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] superposes the sine sweep and nlfr responses for @xmath26 = 45.2 n. around 40 hz , a neimark - sacker bifurcation originally located on the irc changes the stability of the nlfr and generates a new branch of quasiperiodic oscillations ( not shown in the figure ) . as a result",
    ", a stable torus attracts the dynamics and is responsible for the observed envelope modulation . around 45 hz",
    ", a second neimark - sacker bifurcation transforms the quasiperiodic motion back into stable periodic motion .",
    "there is a small delay between the first ( second ) bifurcation and the onset ( disappearance ) of quasiperiodic motion ; this delay can be attributed to the transient character of the swept - sine excitation .",
    "this paper studied the intimate connection that exists between nonlinear normal modes , i.e. , the periodic motions of the undamped , unforced system , and the forced response of the damped system , with a specific focus on modal interactions and isolated resonance curves . to bridge the gap between these two types of response",
    ", the energy balancing technique was adapted to estimate the resonant response to harmonic forcing from the nonlinear modes and the damping matrix . because it is able to reveal the presence of isolated resonance curves , the combination of nonlinear normal modes and energy balancing represents a very useful tool for global analysis of nonlinear systems .",
    "isolated resonance curves , which might easily be missed during numerical continuation or experimental testing , have important practical consequences for the design and testing of engineering structures .",
    "the associated response can be much larger than on the main branch , and , when they connect to the main resonance branch , they may lead to a dramatic and sudden change in resonance frequency , something which is rarely discussed in the mechanical engineering literature .",
