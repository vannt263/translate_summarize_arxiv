    "to date , 14 supernovae ( sne ) have been detected in x - rays in the near aftermath ( days to years ) of their explosions : sne  1978k @xcite , 1979c @xcite , 1980k @xcite , 1986j @xcite , 1987a @xcite , 1988z @xcite , 1993j @xcite , 1994i @xcite , 1994w @xcite , 1995n @xcite , 1998bw ( aka grb  980425 ; pian et al .",

    "we present here results from _ chandra _  observations of sn  1999em and sn  1998s . in general ,",
    "the high x - ray luminosities of these 14 sne ( @xmath910@xmath10 ) dominate the total radiative output of the sne starting at an age of about one year . this soft x - ray",
    "( @xmath11  kev ) emission is most convincingly explained as thermal radiation from the `` reverse shock '' region that forms within the expanding sn ejecta as it interacts with the dense stellar wind of the progenitor star .",
    "the interaction of a spherically symmetric sn shock and a smooth circumstellar medium ( csm ) has been calculated in detail @xcite .",
    "as the sn `` outgoing '' shock emerges from the star , its characteristic velocity is @xmath310@xmath12  , and the density distribution in the outer parts of the ejecta can be approximated by a power - law in radius , @xmath0 , with @xmath13 .",
    "the outgoing shock propagates into a dense csm formed by the pre - sn stellar wind .",
    "this wind is slow ( @xmath14 ) and was formed by a pre - supernova mass - loss rate of @xmath15 to @xmath16  .",
    "the csm density for such a wind decreases as the square of the radius ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the collision between the stellar ejecta and the csm produces a `` reverse '' shock , which travels outward at @xmath310@xmath18  slower than the fastest ejecta .",
    "interaction between the outgoing shock and the csm produces a very hot shell ( @xmath310@xmath19 k ) while the reverse shock / ejecta interaction produces a denser , cooler shell ( @xmath310@xmath20 k ) with much higher emission measure and is where most of the observable x - ray emission arises . if either the csm density or @xmath21 is high , the reverse shock is radiative , resulting in a dense , partly - absorbing shell between the two shocks .",
    "@xcite proposed that the outgoing shock from the sn explosion generates the relativistic electrons and enhanced magnetic field necessary for synchrotron radio emission .",
    "the ionized csm initially absorbs most of this emission , except in cases where synchrotron self - absorption dominates , as may have been the case in sn  1993j @xcite .",
    "however , as the shock passes rapidly outward through the csm , progressively less ionized material is left between the shock and the observer , and absorption decreases rapidly . the observed radio flux density rises accordingly . at the same time ,",
    "emission from the shock region is decreasing slowly as the shock expands so that , when radio absorption has become negligible , the radio light curve follows this decline .",
    "observational evidence also exists at optical wavelengths for this interaction of sn shocks with the winds from pre - supernova mass loss @xcite .",
    "all known radio supernovae appear to share common properties of ( i ) non - thermal synchrotron emission with a high brightness temperature , ( ii ) a decrease in absorption with time , resulting in a smooth , rapid turn - on first at shorter wavelengths and later at longer wavelengths , ( iii ) a power - law decline of the emission flux density with time at each wavelength after maximum flux density ( absorption @xmath22 ) is reached at that wavelength , and , ( iv ) a final , asymptotic approach of the spectral index @xmath23 to an optically thin , non - thermal , constant negative value @xcite .",
    "these properties are consistent with the chevalier model .",
    "the signatures of circumstellar interaction in the radio , optical , and x - ray regimes have been found for a number of type ii sne such as the type ii - l sn  1979c @xcite and the type ii - l sn  1980k @xcite .",
    "the type iin subclass has peculiar optical characteristics : narrow h@xmath23 emission superposed on a broad base ; lack of p cygni absorption - line profiles ; a strong blue continuum ; and slow evolution @xcite .",
    "the narrow optical lines are clear evidence for dense circumstellar gas  they probably arise from the reprocessing of the x - ray emission  and are another significant means by which the shock radiatively cools .",
    "the best recent examples of type iin sne include sne  1978k , 1986j , 1988z , 1994w ( which may have been a peculiar type ii - p , @xcite ) , 1995n , 1997eg , and 1998s .",
    "sn  1999em was optically discovered on 1999 october 29 in ngc  1637 , approximately 15  west and 17  south of the galactic nucleus @xcite .",
    "the spectrum on 1999 october 29 shows a high temperature @xcite , indicating that the supernova was discovered at an early phase .",
    "we take 1999 october 28 as the date of the explosion .",
    "sn  1999em reached a peak brightness of @xmath24 mag on about day  4 , and remained in the `` plateau phase , '' an enduring period of nearly constant v - band brightness , until about 95 days after discovery @xcite . at an estimated distance of 7.8  mpc ( sohn & davidge 1998 ; see also hamuy et al .",
    "2001 who find a distance of 7.5  mpc to sn  1999em based on the expanding photosphere method ) , this is the closest type ii - p supernova yet observed , and it is the only type ii - p observed in both x - rays and radio .",

    "@xcite recently derived a mass of @xmath26  for the progenitor of sn  1999em .    on 1998",
    "march 3 , sn  1998s was optically discovered 16  west and 46  south of the nucleus of ngc  3877 @xcite .",
    "its spectrum quickly revealed it to be a peculiar type iin , with narrow h and he emission lines superimposed on a blue continuum @xcite along with strong n  iii , c  ii , c  iii , and c  iv emission @xcite similar to the `` wolf - rayet '' features seen in the early observations of sn  1983k @xcite .",
    "sn  1998s reached a peak brightness of @xmath27 @xcite . for a distance of 17  mpc @xcite , the intrinsic brightness of @xmath28 marks sn  1998s as one of the optically brightest type ii sne @xcite .",
    "the trigger for our first _ chandra _",
    "observation was the optical discovery of a sn within 10  mpc .",

    "all observations were performed by the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) with the telescope aimpoint on the back - side illuminated s3 chip , which offers increased sensitivity to low energy x - rays over the front - side illuminated chips .",
    "the first two observations used a 1/2 subarray mode ( only half of the ccd was read out ) , while the rest used the full ccd .",

    "except for six weak but significant ( @xmath30 ) detections at mid - cm wavelengths ( 1.5  8.4 ghz ) at ages of between 33 and 69 days , all measurements yielded only upper limits .",
    "extensive optical ground - based observations were made of sn  1999em ; these include _ ubvri _ photometry , long - term spectroscopy , and spectropolarimetry @xcite .",
    "these data were used to obtain a distance with the expanding photosphere method @xcite .",
    "both the photometry and spectroscopy suggest that this was a relatively normal type ii - p event .",
    "we note , however , that sn 1999em was about 1 magnitude fainter in the v - band during the plateau than the average of the 8 sne ii - p with published photometry and previously derived epm distances , and it may have also had a somewhat unusual color evolution @xcite .",
    "spectropolarimetry of sn  1999em was obtained on 1999 november 5 , december 8 , and december 17 ( 7 , 40 , and 49 days after discovery , respectively , while it was still in its plateau phase ) with the kast double spectrograph @xcite with polarimeter at the cassegrain focus of the shane 3-m telescope at lick observatory .",

    "march 7 , just 5 days after the discovery of sn  1998s , optical spectropolarimetry was obtained of the supernova with lrisp on the keck - ii 10-m telescope @xcite .",

    "see @xcite for details of the optical observations and reductions .",
    "for each observation , we followed the data preparation threads provided by the _ chandra _  x - ray center .",

    "bad pixels were excluded , and intervals of bad aspect were eliminated .",
    "all data were searched for intervals of background flaring , in which the count rate can increase by factors of up to 100 over the quiescent rate .",
    "the light curves of background regions were manually inspected to determine intervals in which the quiescent rate could be reliably calculated . in accordance with the prescription given by the acis calibration team , we identify flares as having a count rate @xmath3130% of the quiescent rate .",
    "background flares were found in each of the first four and the last observation of sn  1999em , lasting from hundreds of seconds to over 15  ksec . only the second and fifth observations of sn  1998s had such flares , lasting @xmath3300  sec and @xmath314  ksec , respectively .",

    "this randomization has the effect of removing the artificial substructure ( moir pattern ) that results as a byproduct of spacecraft dither .",
    "since all of our observations contained a substantial number of dither cycles ( one dither cycle has a period of @xmath31000  sec ) , this substructure is effectively washed out , and there is no need to blur the image with pixel randomization . removing this",

    "an estimated spectral luminosity of sn  1999em at 6 cm peak on day @xmath334 of @xmath38 erg s@xmath39 hz@xmath39 makes it the least radio luminous rsn known except for the peculiar , and very nearby , sn  1987a .",

    "a very low but temporally increasing polarization level suggests a substantially spherical geometry at early times that becomes more aspherical at late times as ever - deeper layers of the ejecta are revealed .",
    "when modeled in terms of oblate , electron - scattering atmospheres , the observed polarization implies an asphericity of at least 7% during the period studied .",
    "we speculate that the thick hydrogen envelope intact at the time of explosion in sne ii - p might serve to dampen the effects of an intrinsically aspherical explosion .",
    "the increase in asphericity seen at later times is consistent with a trend recently identified @xcite among stripped - envelope core - collapse sne : the deeper we peer , the more evidence we find for asphericity .",
    "the natural conclusion that it is an _ explosion _ asymmetry that is responsible for the polarization has fueled the idea that some core - collapse sne produce gamma - ray bursts ( grb ; e.g. , @xcite ) through the action of a jet of material aimed fortuitously at the observer , the result of a `` bipolar , '' jet - induced , sn explosion @xcite .",
    "additional multi - epoch spectropolarimetry of sne ii - p are clearly needed , however , to determine if the temporal polarization increase seen in sn  1999em is generic to this class .",

    "in addition to constructing multicolour x - ray lightcurves ( fig .  [",
    "fig : lc98s ] ) , the high luminosity of sn  1998s ( @xmath41  ) allowed for basic spectral fitting to be done for each of the first four observations ; in the fifth , there were too few counts for a similar type of analysis .",
    "we performed this in xspec  with the vmekal  model , which is identical to the mekal  model but allows individual elemental abundances to vary . using the reddening @xmath42 @xcite , we calculated the hydrogen column density to be @xmath43 @xcite .",

    "because there were virtually no counts above @xmath3 7  kev in any of the observations , we would `` smear '' the fe line at 6.7  kev if we required more than @xmath3 7 counts per bin .",
    "therefore , we set the minimum number of counts per bin to the highest possible value which would still retain the integrity of the fe line .",

    "sn 1999em was a type ii - p sn , so we expect that the star exploded as a red supergiant with most of its hydrogen envelope . the value of @xmath21 for such a star is usually taken to be in the range @xmath64 @xcite ,",
    "although @xcite recently found that the explosion of a red supergiant leads to @xmath65 at high velocity . in the case of sn  1999em , we have some additional information from modeling of the optical spectrum .",
    "@xcite were able to model spectra on 1999 october 29 and november 4/5 with @xmath66 , 8 , or 9 .",
    "the modeling of the data for the earlier time suggests a relatively flat density profile ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the spectra on 1999 october 29 also show evidence for a secondary absorption feature at 20,000  , implying the presence of denser material in the cool ejecta . one possible origin for high velocity",
    ", dense ejecta is the shell that can form as a result of the diffusion of radiation at the time of shock breakout ( chevalier 1976 ) ; if this is the origin , it represents the highest velocity material in the ejecta .",
    "we assume that the outer density profile can be approximated as a power law out to this high velocity and take @xmath66 or @xmath67 .",
    "the value of @xmath63 is equivalent to specifying the density in the ejecta at some particular velocity and age .",
    "the model by @xcite for 1999 october 29 has @xmath68  at 10,000  at an age of 1 year .",
    "this value is in approximate accord with the density found in models with a broken power law density profile , mass of 10  , and energy of @xmath69  ergs @xcite .",
    "the density in the wind is @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the mass - loss rate and @xmath52 is the wind velocity .",
    "we take @xmath72  and @xmath73  as reference values .",
    "the interaction of the supernova with a freely expanding wind leads to a shocked shell with radius @xmath74 or @xmath75 .",

    "the low observed x - ray luminosity suggests that the shocked gas is not radiative ; this can be checked for consistency after a model is produced . under these conditions ,",

    "@xcite find possible evidence for enhanced he in sn 1999em , but this is uncertain and is probably not expected in a type ii - p sn .",
    "we take @xmath82 ; the uncertainty is small . on 1999",
    "november 1 , which we take to be day  4 , the observed luminosity ( 0.48  kev ) is @xmath83  and the temperature is 5.0  kev . with @xmath84 , we find that @xmath85 @xmath86 or 2 @xmath87 , quite similar to the value of @xmath88 obtained above from the radio observations . with this mass - loss rate , the cooling time for the gas , as deduced from eq .",
    "( 3.7 ) of flc96 , is @xmath89  days for @xmath90 and is longer for the @xmath66 case , which justifies our use of the adiabatic expression for the x - ray luminosity .",
    "the cooling time grows more rapidly than the age , so we expect non - radiative evolution through the time of our observations .",
    "if cooling were important , a dense shell would form that could absorb x - ray emission from the reverse shock wave , as appeared to occur in the initial evolution of sn  1993j ( flc96 ; suzuki & nomoto 1995 ) .",
    "reradiation of the absorbed emission can give broad optical emission lines , as observed in sn  1993j at ages @xmath91  year .",

    "the observed temperature on 1999 november 1 falls between these two cases .",
    "the predicted evolution of the temperature is @xmath111 @xmath86 and @xmath112 @xmath87 .",
    "table  [ tab : fits99em ] compares this predicted evolution with that observed .",
    "the observations show a clear cooling , as expected .",
    "an additional factor could be the lack of electron - ion equilibration at the reverse shock front ; if it is not achieved , the electrons are cooler than the above estimate . from eq .",
    "( 3.6 ) of flc96 , the expected conditions are such that the equilibration timescale is comparable to the age throughout the evolution , so that no firm conclusion can be drawn .",
    "the fact that cooling of the emission is clearly observed argues for a relatively flat density profile for the ejecta , as also found by @xcite from optical spectroscopy .",
    "an estimate of the expected evolution of the total x - ray luminosity , , is given by @xcite .",

    "the observed temperatures indicate that a transition occurred .",
    "again , the observations are in approximate accord with expectations .",
    "one aspect of the x - ray observations that is not compatible with the simplest wind interaction model is the increase of the soft x - ray flux on 2000 february 2 ( day  102 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lc99em ] ) . in our model ,",
    "the emission is primarily from the reverse shocked ejecta , so the increase could be due to a region of increased density in the ejecta . at this age ,",
    "the velocity of the ejecta entering the reverse shock front is @xmath119  .",
    "alternatively , the emission could be from an inhomogeneity in the circumstellar wind .",
    "the smooth wind is shocked to a temperature @xmath120  k , so that a density contrast of @xmath121 is needed for the inhomogeneity .",
    "the inhomogeneity must be large to affect the total luminosity , but a substantial change in stellar mass - loss characteristics at only @xmath122  cm from the star is unlikely .",
    "the fact that the change is transitory also argues against a change in mass - loss properties at this point .    although sn  1999em was detected as a weak radio source , the radio light curves are not well defined because of the very low radio flux density .",
    "the early observations were not of sufficient sensitivity to detect the source so the time of light curve peak and the early absorption process are also not well defined .",
    "the 8.44  ghz observations are the most useful in this regard . at late times , the observed flux evolution of other radio supernovae is @xmath123 , or steeper @xcite , so that the 8.44  ghz upper limit on day  7 probably indicates that absorption was significant at that time . with this value for the time of peak flux at 8.44  ghz ( actually a lower limit ) , we can place sn  1999em on a diagram of peak radio luminosity vs. time of peak ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rad0307 ] ) .",
    "the diagonal lines show the velocity of the shocked shell if synchrotron self - absorption were the important process for the early absorption @xcite .",
    "the position of sn  1999em gives about @xmath124  , or less , as the shell velocity .",
    "thus , it is just possible that synchrotron self - absorption was important at early times but more likely that another process , probably free - free absorption by the unshocked wind , was dominant . from eq .",
    "( 2.3 ) of flc96 , the 8.44  ghz free - free optical depth on day  7 with @xmath80 and @xmath125 as deduced above is @xmath126 @xmath86 or @xmath127 @xmath87 , where @xmath128 is the temperature of the unshocked wind in units of @xmath129  k. the @xmath66 case is somewhat more consistent with the observations because of the higher mass - loss rate deduced for this case .",
    "the free - free absorption of the radio emission depends on the circumstellar temperature .",
    "@xcite find from a simulation of a type ii - p explosion an effective temperature at outbreak of @xmath130  k and luminosity @xmath131  .",
    "this temperature is similar to that used in one model by @xcite for sn  1987a ( their table 1 ) . their model with @xmath132",
    "gives a wind temperature of @xmath133  k for @xmath134  k. because of the low wind density , this temperature is not sensitive to the mass - loss rate and is mainly set by the outburst radiation temperature . an approximate temperature in the wind of sn",
    "1999em should therefore be @xmath135 .",
    "the temperature at @xmath330  days should not be very different because of the low wind density .",
    "x - ray heating by the shock has not been included here , but is probably not important because of the low x - ray luminosity .",
    "overall , the x - ray and radio observations of sn  1999em are consistent with the non - radiative interaction of supernova ejecta with a power law profile ( @xmath136 ) interacting with a pre - supernova wind with @xmath137 .",
    "we estimate the accuracy of this mass - loss density to be a factor of 2 .",
    "the x - ray emission is primarily from the reversed shocked ejecta , and the model can account for the luminosity , temperature , and temperature evolution of the emission .",
    "it does not account for the large soft x - ray flux observed on day  102 .",
    "the radio observations are compatible with this general picture and suggest a comparable mass - loss rate .",
    "the high x - ray luminosity of sn  1998s places it in the same class as the x - ray bright type iin sne  1978k , 1986j , 1988z , and 1995n .",
    "@xcite discussed x - ray observations of sn  1995n and summarized the results on the other sne .",
    "sn  1995n had an x - ray luminosity of @xmath138  at an age of 2.0  years .",
    "sn  1998s is at the low end of the x - ray luminosities spanned by these sources    the optical emission from sn 1998s shows both narrow and broad lines that can be attributed to circumstellar interaction @xcite .",
    "the narrow lines are presumably from dense circumstellar gas that is heated and ionized by the supernova radiation . although high velocities ( @xmath139 ) are observed in the early evolution of sn  1998s , by day  494 the maximum observed velocities were @xmath140 @xcite .",
    "these velocities are much higher than the estimated velocity of gas at the photosphere , indicating that the emission is from circumstellar interaction .",
    "the interpretation of the x - ray emission from type iin supernovae is not straightforward because of the possibility that the emission is from shocked circumstellar clumps ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite on sn  1986j and @xcite on sn  1988z ) .",
    "the radio results for sn 1998s indicate that the csm is likely clumpy or filamentary @xcite .",
    "however , if our finding of heavy element overabundances is correct , the x - ray emission is expected to be from shocked sn ejecta .",
    "if the interaction can be approximately described by smooth ejecta running into a smooth circumstellar wind , the temperature behind the reverse shock front is @xmath105  kev ( @xmath90 ) , @xmath141  kev ( @xmath66 ) , or @xmath142  kev ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "it is difficult to produce the high observed temperature ( @xmath144  kev ) unless there is unseen high velocity gas and the ejecta density profile is relatively flat .",
    "the observations do not show the cooling that is expected as the shock interaction region decelerates , but the range in time is not large enough for the effect to be clearly visible .",
    "the x - ray luminosity shows a clear decline with time , approximately @xmath145 .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with what is expected for free - free emission from a non - radiative shock region ( @xmath118 dependence as discussed above ) , so we can again use eq .",
    "( 2 ) to estimate the mass - loss rate .",
    "the result is @xmath146 , where @xmath147  , if @xmath143 and @xmath148 ( these estimates are implied by the high observed temperature of @xmath310  kev ) on day  665 , again comparable to that determined from radio modeling of @xmath149 . a high mass - loss rate is required to produce the x - ray luminosity , but the cooling time is still longer than the age .",
    "the assumption of a non - radiative reverse shock region is justified . in this model ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the forward shock region is comparable to that from the reverse shock .",
    "however , the higher temperature of the forward shock region implies that the reverse shock dominates the emission in the energy band that we observed .",
    "the radio luminosity of sn 1998s is low for a rsn with a late turn - on time ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rad0307 ] ) .",
    "this implies that synchrotron self - absorption was not important for the early absorption .",
    "this accounts for the basic features of the x - ray emission .",
    "the flat supernova density profile implies that much of the supernova energy is in high velocity ejecta .",
    "a similar deduction was made by @xcite for sn  1988z .",
    "the heavy element overabundances require that these elements be mixed out to a high velocity in the ejecta , which has been shown to occur in cas  a @xcite . in theoretical models of aspherical explosions ,",
    "heavy - element - rich matter is naturally ejected at high velocities , which well explains the peculiar late spectral features of sn  1998bw @xcite .",
    "the polarization and spectral line profiles observed in sn  1998s @xcite show that the explosion was complex , i.e.  that the spherically symmetric model described here must be an oversimplification .",
    "we turn now to the observed elemental abundance ratios in the summed _",
    "chandra _  spectrum ( table  [ tab : summed98s ] ) , which are enhanced by a factor of @xmath3 3 - 30 over solar .",
    "these heavy elements must have been synthesized in the core evolution and explosion .    in core - collapse supernovae , a strong shock wave forms and propagates outward through the star ( e.g. , shigeyama & nomoto 1990 ) . behind the shock , materials are explosively burned into heavy elements and accelerated to @xmath35000  km  s@xmath39 . at the composition interface ,",
    "the expanding materials are decelerated by the collision with the outer layers , which induces the rayleigh - taylor instability ( e.g. , ebisuzaki , nomoto , & nomoto 1988 ; arnett et al .",
    "heavy elements are then mixed into outer layers .",
    "such a mixing induced at the si / o , c / he , and he / h interfaces brings fe - peak elements , as well as si , mg , ne , o , and c , into the h - rich envelope .",
    "these heavy elements in many rayleigh - taylor fingers are rather well - mixed through the interaction between the fingers ( e.g. , hachisu et al .",
    "we thus assume that , although the heavy elements mixed into the h - rich envelope consists of only a fraction of the core materials , the abundance ratios among the mixed heavy elements are the same as in the integrated core materials . the mixing associated with the rayleigh - taylor instabilities continues",
    "until the shock wave reaches the surface and the expansion becomes homologous .",
    "when the ejecta collides with the circumstellar matter , forward and reverse shock waves form and the latter propagates back into the h - rich envelope .",
    "the mass of the reverse - shocked h - rich envelope @xmath150 at the time of the observations depends on the strength of the circumstellar interaction and the density structure of the h - rich envelope ( e.g. , chevalier & fransson 1994 ; suzuki & nomoto 1995 ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath151 the mass of heavy elements mixed into the reverse - shocked h - rich envelope .",
    "the observed mass fraction of heavy elements is then @xmath151/@xmath152 , where @xmath153 denotes the h mass fraction .",
    "we briefly summarize here the three types of heavy elements ejected from core - collapse sne ( e.g. , thielemann , nomoto , & hashimoto 1996 ) :    o , ne , and mg : : :    these elements are synthesized mostly before collapse during core- and    shell - c burning ; some ne is processed into mg and o during ne burning .    in the explosion ,",
    "these elements are partially produced by explosive c    burning , ne is partially burned into mg and si , and o and mg are    partially burned into si .",
    "the masses of these elements are sensitive    to the progenitor mass , @xmath154 , increasing with    @xmath154 .",
    "however , the degree of dependence on @xmath154    varies across elements .",
    "for example , the ne / mg ratio depends on the    conditions of c and ne burning , thus depending on @xmath154 .",
    "si , s , and ar : : :    these elements are produced by explosive o burning during the    explosion .",
    "their masses do not much depend on @xmath154 since    the pre - collapse core structure is not very sensitive to    @xmath154 .",
    "fe : : :    the mass of ejected fe is very sensitive to the mass cut that divides    the compact remnant and the ejecta , or the amount of fall - back matter .    theoretically , it is not possible to make a good estimate of the fe    mass because of the uncertainties in the explosion mechanism .",
    "in our comparisons , we use si for normalization because it is the least dependent on @xmath154 .",
    "we do not use fe for comparison because of the large theoretical uncertainties .",
    "we now compare the o / si , ne / si , and mg / si ratios ( relative to the solar abundance ratios ) with the theoretical calculations of @xcite .",
    "these models are summarized in table  [ tab : nomoto ] .",
    "the observed o / si value of 01.2 seems to indicate that the mass of the progenitor was @xmath15520  .",
    "the mg / si value of 00.7 also points to a progenitor mass of @xmath15620  .",
    "the observed ne / si ratio of 0.614 excludes progenitor masses of @xmath15515  . according to these models",
    ", the mass of the proginitor must have been between 15  and 20  .",
    "we note that the supernova yields are determined by the helium core mass @xmath157 of the progenitor rather than the zero - age main - sequence mass @xmath154 .",
    "thus the mg / si and ne / si results actually provide the constraint @xmath158 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath154-@xmath157 relation depends on the mass loss .",
    "if we adopt the spiral - in binary scenario for the origin of type iin sn @xcite , a large amount of mass - loss in the early phase of the progenitor s expansion leads to a smaller @xmath157 compared with the case of no mass loss . in this case",
    ", the progenitor of sn  1998s could be initially more massive .",
    "observations at radio , optical , and x - ray wavelengths have allowed the estimation of the physical parameters of two quite different type ii sn examples , type ii - p sn  1999em and type iin sn  1998s . from these results , it is possible to study , over a broad wavelength range , the physical parameters of the explosions and the structure and density of the csm established by the pre - sn wind .",
    "such results are of importance for estimation of the properties of the pre - sn star and its last stages of evolution before explosion ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in addition , the _ chandra _  data have revealed the presence of many heavy elements in the spectrum of sn  1998s .",
    "we have shown the kind of analysis that can be done by comparing the observed x - ray determined abundance ratios to the model predictions , and we were able to show that the mass of the progenitor was @xmath31520  .",
    "we do caution , however , that our model assumptions on mixing are approximate and that there are uncertainties in both the interpretation of the x - ray data and the model calculations . because of the great diversity of type ii ( and related type ib / c ) sne , only the multiwavelength study of additional examples can yield a comprehensive understanding of the last stages of massive star evolution .",

    "<S> sn  1999em is the first type ii - p detected at both x - ray and radio wavelengths . it is the least radio luminous and one of the least x - ray luminous sne ever detected ( except for the unusual and very close sn  1987a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the _ chandra _  </S>",
    "<S> x - ray data indicate non - radiative interaction of sn ejecta with a power - law density profile ( @xmath0 with @xmath1 ) for a pre - sn wind with a low mass - loss rate of @xmath2  for a wind velocity of 10  , in agreement with radio mass - loss rate estimates . </S>",

    "<S> data show an unexpected , temporary rise in the 0.42.0  kev x - ray flux at @xmath3100 days after explosion . </S>",
    "<S> sn  1998s , at an age of @xmath43 years , is still bright in x - rays and is increasing in flux density at cm radio wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> spectral fits to the _ chandra _  data show that many heavy elements ( ne , al , si , s , ar , and fe ) are overabundant with respect to solar values . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the observed elemental abundances and abundance ratios to theoretical calculations and find that our data are consistent with a progenitor mass of approximately 1520  if the heavy element ejecta are radially mixed out to a high velocity . if the x - ray emission is from the reverse shock wave region , the supernova density profile must be moderately flat at a velocity @xmath5  , the shock front is non - radiative at the time of the observations , and the mass - loss rate is 12@xmath6  for a pre - supernova wind velocity of @xmath7  . </S>",
    "<S> this result is also supported by modeling of the radio emission which implies that sn  1998s is surrounded by a clumpy or filamentary csm established by a high mass - loss rate , @xmath8  , from the pre - supernova star . </S>"
