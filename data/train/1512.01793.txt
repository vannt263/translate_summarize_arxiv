    "( about the signature there is a detailed explanation in @xcite ) .",
    "the signature is an invariant of knots , and in general the following holds .",
    "[ thm122 ]    @xmath145    in addition for a alternating diagram , it is known that @xmath146 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath147 is the sum of local writhes of all crossings , @xmath148 is the number of domains colored with a grayish color when we give checkerboard coloring as shown in figure [ fig:5 - 01ji ] , and @xmath149 is the number of domains which are not colored .",
    "for example , in the case as shown in figure [ fig:5 - 01ji ] , the number of @xmath15 crossings is @xmath25 , and that of @xmath16 crossings is @xmath150 , then @xmath151 , and @xmath152 , @xmath153 .",
    "therefore we can get @xmath154 , and @xmath155 .",
    "in actually , we can obtain a diagram of a trivial knot with one crossing change , hence @xmath156 .        about the relation between the trivializing number and the unknotting number",
    ", it is known that @xmath157   @xmath158 holds in general .",
    "however , particularly for positive knots , there exists a conjecture that @xmath159 ( @xcite ) . and as the partial positive answer of this , we have the next corollary to theorem [ thm118 ] and theorem [ thm122 ] .    [ cor123 ]",
    "let @xmath4 be a positive 2-bridge knot and has a diagram @xmath9 = @xmath160  @xmath26 for any @xmath27  @xmath161 .",
    "if @xmath38 is even for any @xmath27  @xmath162 , or @xmath33 is even for any @xmath27  @xmath162 , then @xmath159 .",
    "[ pr124 ] first we prove the case where any @xmath38 is an even number . in this case",
    ", @xmath9 is a minimal diagram of @xmath4 , so by theorem [ thm114 ] , @xmath9 is an positive and alternating diagram . besides , by the proposition [ prop116 ] , @xmath35 must be an odd number and other @xmath163  are necessarily all even numbers .",
    "moreover , the sign of any crossing is @xmath15 , thereby @xmath164 .",
    "the checkerboard coloring is like as shown in figure [ fig:5 - 02ji ] , and we know @xmath165 , @xmath166 .",
    "is an even number , width=302 ]    therefore , next equality holds .",
    "@xmath167    furthermore by theorem [ thm122 ] , we can see @xmath168 . in",
    "actually as shown in figure [ fig:5 - 03ji ] , we can obtain a trivial diagram by some crossing changes of the crossings which correspondent to lower tangles , and the number of these crossing changes is @xmath169 .",
    "hence @xmath170 .",
    "finally we can get the inequality @xmath171 and the equality @xmath172 . thus @xmath159 holds .    in the case",
    "that any @xmath33 is an even number , we can also gain this equality in a similar fashion .",
    "this result is for the special case of positive 2-bridge knots .",
    "so whether  @xmath173 holds for any minimal diagram of positive 2-bridge knots or not , and whether  @xmath159 holds or not , these questions are our theme of the future .",
    "for positive pretzel knots we can get the following :            a diagram @xmath9 of knot @xmath4 is as shown in figure [ fig:6 - 01ji ] , and we know this diagram is positive and alternating . besides the sub - chord diagram which corresponds to each @xmath180 is an i - chord .",
    "so the chord diagram of @xmath9 is as shown in figure [ fig:6 - 02ji ] .",
