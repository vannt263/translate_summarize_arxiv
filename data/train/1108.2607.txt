    "over the past few years , nanomechanics and the field of topological condensed matter systems have been pushing limits in their respective area of research .",
    "nanomechanical systems have proven to be exceptional measurement devices for , e.g. , mass , force , and position @xcite , as well as a unique platform for studying fundamental questions concerning the quantum nature of macroscopic objects , theoretically as well as experimentally @xcite .",
    "majorana fermions are among the most intriguing features of topological states of matter .",
    "they are their own anti - particles , i.e. , @xmath1 , and satisfy fermionic anticommutation relations @xmath2 .",
    "a majorana fermion has half the degrees of freedom of a dirac fermion .",
    "this can be seen , for instance , by expressing two majorana fermions @xmath3 as @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the annihilation and creation operators , respectively , of a single dirac fermion and satisfy @xmath8 .",
    "various proposals have been made about how to generate majorana states @xcite . in view of future applications",
    ", these states might be particularly useful in the field of topological quantum computation @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , to date no experimental realization of majorana fermions has been achieved .",
    "proposed detection schemes are based on tunnel setups @xcite , interferometer setups @xcite and the josephson effect @xcite .",
    "however it is fair to say that true qualitative experimental signatures of majorana fermions that persist in realistic systems are rather difficult to predict .    in this paper , we present a novel scheme for detecting majorana bound states ( mbs ) at the edges of topological superconductors .",
    "our proposal involves an oscillating electrode tunnel coupled to a topological superconductor ( ts ) hosting mbs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : modelsystem ] ) .",
    "we show that the interplay between the two weakly coupled mbs , located at the edges of the ts , and the oscillating electrode gives rise to unique features in the differential conductance of the setup .",
    "we find that in the presence of the resonator , satellite peaks appear in the differential conductance .",
    "we identify the underlying transport processes giving rise to the rich structure in the differential conductance .",
    "furthermore , we study the dependence of the differential conductance on the effective temperature of the oscillator and find for an oscillator close to its quantum mechanical ground state a qualitative transport signature which is due to the interplay between the resonator and the majorana bound states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the setup under investigation and the underlying model in sec .",

    "[ sec : results ] , we present our results with subsections focusing on a setup with and without the resonator . finally , we conclude in sec .  [",

    "the detection scheme we propose is schematically depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : modelsystem ] .",
    "the ts can , for instance , be realized as a semiconducting wire with strong spin - orbit coupling placed on top of an @xmath0-wave superconductor in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "its left and right edges host two mbs which we call @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "one of the edges , say the right one , is coupled by tunneling to a movable doubly clamped beam . while this setup can be technically challenging to realize",
    ", one should note that the fabrication of metallic doubly clamped nanoresonators with very high frequencies and quality factors has been recently reported @xcite .",
    "the motion of the beam modulates the tunnel amplitude , such that it depends on the displacement @xmath11 of the beam .",
    "the oscillating electrode is held at a bias voltage @xmath12 and the ts is grounded .",
    "we approximate the tunnel amplitude as linear in the displacement of the beam , @xmath13 .",
    "this approximation is justified if the oscillation amplitude is small compared to the mean distance between the beam and the edge of the ts .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is then given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 describes a spinless electron reservoir in the metallic oscillating electrode .",
    "here , we restrict ourselves to one spin channel only .",
    "this is appropriate since the one - dimensional ( 1d ) semiconducting wire on top of an @xmath0-wave superconductor in the presence of a magnetic field has the same degrees of freedom as a spinless @xmath16 superconductor @xcite . in reality , both spins will participate and their signal will add up to the one we calculate below .",
    "furthermore , we assume a linear dispersion @xmath17 .",
    "next , @xmath18 is the usual harmonic oscillator hamiltonian describing the motion of the beam with an effective mass @xmath19 and resonance frequency @xmath20 .",
    "the term @xmath21 characterizes the overlap between the mbs on the left edge and the right edge of the ts @xcite . describing these two majorana fermions as one dirac fermion",
    ", we can rewrite @xmath22 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath23 is formally identical to that of a single resonant level ( rl ) at energy @xmath24 .",
    "however , due to the nonlocal nature of the mbs , the overlap @xmath24 depends exponentially on the effective length @xmath25 of the ts .",
    "this distinguishes the mbs hamiltonian from a rl . in order to probe the length dependence of @xmath24",

    "we assume that the lead electrons only couple to @xmath10 in @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which is justified if the wire is much longer than the superconducting coherence length @xmath31 of the @xmath0-wave sc , the characteristic localization length of the mbs@xcite .    since mbs are subgap states",
    ", we investigate the regime of a large superconducting gap @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the density of states of the metallic lead .",
    "if the electrode does not oscillate , the system is described by the quadratic hamiltonian @xmath35 . in this case , all green s functions ( gf ) involving @xmath36 and @xmath6 operators are known exactly .",
    "since @xmath37 does not conserve fermion numbers , the anomalous gf do not vanish , e.g. , @xmath38 . then",
    ", nonequilibrium transport properties like the current or the current noise can be determined exactly @xcite .",
    "we shall treat the @xmath11-dependence of the tunneling amplitude as a perturbation to the hamiltonian @xmath39 .",
    "this requires that @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the amplitude of the zero point fluctuations and @xmath42 the mean phonon number of the resonator .",

    "we express the second - order correction to the gf matrix in terms of the advanced , retarded , and keldysh components as @xmath67 where the transformation is given by @xmath68 this leads to the following compact form of the second - order correction to the gf in the rotated keldysh space : @xmath69_{jk } \\",

    "we demonstrate in the following that the average current contains unique information about the mbs which can be most easily identified in the nonlinear differential conductance @xmath78 .",
    "compared to earlier proposals @xcite , we have two additional energy scales involved in the detection scheme : the resonance frequency @xmath20 of the oscillator and its effective temperature @xmath79 .",
    "both are to some extent experimentally tunable . assuming that the oscillator is in a thermal state , one has @xmath80 where @xmath81 $ ] is the mean phonon number of the oscillator and where we set @xmath82 . in the following",
    ", we will discuss the regime where @xmath42 is small , i.e. , comparable to 1 .",
    "this is challenging to realize experimentally .",
    "note , however , that for the highest resonance frequencies of the doubly clamped beams in ref .",
    "( @xmath83 mhz ) , the thermal occupation number could actually become less than 1 at typical dilution refrigerator temperatures . at higher temperatures or lower frequencies ,",
    "one would have to implement additional cooling schemes to bring the oscillator to the quantum regime . in our model , we make the assumption that the electronic system is at zero temperature , @xmath84 .",
    "the side peaks in the differential conductance can be resolved as long as @xmath85 .",
    "if the electronic system and the oscillator are in equilibrium with the same heat bath , this translates to the requirement @xmath86 .",
    "however , @xmath85 can also be fulfilled for larger @xmath42 if the oscillator is put into an excited state using experimental techniques as , for instance , done in ref .  .",
    "for clarity , let us start with the case without oscillator ( @xmath87 ) and briefly discuss the dependence of the differential conductance on the length of the ts and thus its dependence on @xmath24 .",
    "in the case of a finite overlap of the two mbs , the differential conductance shows two peaks at @xmath88 which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : didv1 ] ( a ) ( see also ref .   for comparison ) .",
    "both of the peaks have the height @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "importantly , for any finite @xmath24 , @xmath78 at @xmath90 vanishes in our model .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the differential conductance in quantum dots coupled to one superconducting and one normal lead @xcite .",
    "hence , it is rather straightforward to distinguish this situation from the mbs case .",
    "as mentioned above , the hamiltonian @xmath23 is formally equivalent to one describing a spinless resonant level at energy @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , a comparison to a resonant level case is of pedagogical value . two resonant levels with energies @xmath91 might lead to a similar signal in the differential conductance as in the mbs case .",
    "this could , for instance , happen if the magnetic field destroyed the superconductivity in an experimental realization of our proposal . increasing the effective length of the wire using the gate electrodes",
    ", one can tune @xmath24 close to zero , which would yield a single peak at @xmath90 ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : didv1 ] ) .",
    "however , this feature in the differential conductance could also be due to a single rl with energy @xmath92 and consequently an ordinary bound state might mistakenly be identified as a mbs .",
    "we conclude that tunneling into resonant levels could be hard to distinguish from tunneling into mbs .",
    "it is fair to say that a measurement of @xmath78 as a function of the variation of the length of the ts could yield a strong signature of mbs , even in the case of static leads . furthermore , @xmath93 on resonance in the mbs case , which might not be the case for tunneling into a rl .",
    "interestingly , we show below that the oscillating electrode exhibits additional features in the differential conductance , allowing for an unambiguous identification of mbs .",
    "the differential conductance in the presence of the oscillator and its dependence on the oscillator s temperature is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : didv1](b ) and [ fig : didv1](c ) for two temperatures corresponding to @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively . due to the presence of the oscillator ,",
    "satellite peaks emerge at @xmath96 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : procs ] , we depict the energetically allowed tunnel processes for @xmath97 , which explain the emerging satellite peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig : didv1 ] .",
    "( note that for @xmath98 more processes are possible corresponding to the emission of a phonon by the oscillator .",
    "these are not shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : procs ] . ) evidently , for the conventional processes in figs .",
    "[ fig : procs](a ) , [ fig : procs](c ) , and [ fig : procs](e ) , the superconducting condensate does not play any role . hence",
    ", these processes also matter for tunneling into a rl where the condensate in fig .",
    "[ fig : procs ] would be replaced by a second lead .",
    "the processes in figs .",
    "[ fig : procs](b ) , [ fig : procs](d ) , and [ fig : procs](f ) , on the other hand , rely on the presence of the superconducting condensate .",
    "importantly , all processes in figs .",
    "[ fig : procs](a ) to [ fig : procs](f ) contribute together to the rich structure in the @xmath78 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : didv1 ] .",
    "increasing the oscillator s temperature leads to an increase in the heights of the satellite peaks and transforms a dip at @xmath96 into a peak .",
    "this will be further discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig : didv2 ] .    as mentioned above",
    ", one can argue that in a single rl scenario with level energy @xmath92 , the signal in the differential conductance could not be clearly distinguished from the one stemming from mbs . including the oscillator permits us to unambiguously distinguish the two cases .",
    "figure  [ fig : didv2 ] shows our key result . in that figure",
    ", we compare the rl case to the mbs case , both in the presence of an oscillating tunnel contact . for clarity , we focus on a region around the resonant frequency @xmath20 of the oscillator and positive bias voltage @xmath12 .",
    "importantly , an oscillator in its ground state ( @xmath97 ) can only absorb a phonon . in the case of the single rl",
    ", the crucial tunnel process near the resonance at @xmath99 ( for an oscillator with @xmath97 ) is depicted in the right inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : didv2 ] .",
    "we see that this process only sets in for voltages @xmath100 ( at zero temperature ) since the state in the right lead has to be occupied in order to transfer the energy @xmath20 to the oscillator . as a consequence ,",
    "the differential conductance is only positive for @xmath100 ( shown as a solid black line in fig .",
    "[ fig : didv2 ] ) .",
    "the situation is very different for the mbs case . here",
    ", we have a second crucial tunnel process depicted in the left inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : didv2 ] .",
    "then , the dashed - dotted blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig : didv2 ] illustrates that , for the oscillator in its ground state and mbs present , the @xmath78 is positive for @xmath101 and @xmath100 .",
    "this feature is only due to tunneling through mbs and clearly separates the rl from the mbs scenario . if we gradually increase @xmath42 from zero to one ( where only the two extremes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : didv2 ] ) , the dip for @xmath97 in the mbs case transforms smoothly into a peak due to additional processes where the oscillator emits a phonon .",
    "the dip at @xmath99 is due to an interference effect between the two participating tunnel processes which can be understood on the basis of fermi s golden rule . to illustrate this , we choose @xmath102 and @xmath94 and write the system hamiltonian as @xmath103 with @xmath104 in our initial state ,",
    "the fermi sea should be filled up to the chemical potential @xmath105 ( measured from @xmath92 ) , furthermore the fermionic subgap state @xmath6 is empty and no phonons are present , written as @xmath106 with energy @xmath107 , @xmath108 being the energy of the filled fermi sea .    to the lowest order in @xmath60 , the leading contribution to @xmath78 at @xmath109",
    "is generated by a combination of the two tunneling processes @xmath110 and @xmath111 , where one of them is accompanied by the creation of a phonon mode .",
    "the current - carrying transport processes we focus on are mediated by the processes described by @xmath112 in combination with @xmath111 ( cf . insets in fig .",
    "[ fig : didv2 ] ) . for",
    "these transport processes the final state lacks two electrons in the fermi sea ( at momenta @xmath113 ) , contains one phonon and an unoccupied subgap state @xmath6 , i.e. we have @xmath114 with energy @xmath115 where @xmath17 is the single - particle electron energy and the phonon energy is @xmath20 . as usual , the transition amplitude between the states above , up to second order in @xmath116 is given by @xmath117 and according to fermi s golden rule , the rate @xmath118 is given by summing over all final states respecting energy conservation @xmath119 the rate @xmath118 is proportional to the current , and therefore @xmath120 proportional to the differential conductance . by evaluating the amplitude @xmath121 and the rate @xmath118",
    ", we find that for the above process , the amplitude @xmath121 vanishes for tunneling particles with energy close to @xmath109 .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that for @xmath109 the differential conductance vanishes due to an interference effect between the two processes ( of order @xmath122 ) generated by the terms @xmath123 and @xmath124 in the tunneling hamiltonian .",
    "this explains the dip in the differential conductance @xmath125 in fig .",
    "[ fig : didv2 ] .",
    "to conclude , we have presented an idea of coupling majorana bound states to a sensitive nanoelectromechanical measurement device .",
    "we have shown that a setup where an oscillating , doubly clamped beam is tunnel coupled to a topological superconductor gives rise to unique transport signatures based on the interplay between the mechanical excitations and the majorana bound states .",
    "a smoking gun signature of majorana bound states has been identified for an oscillator close to the quantum ground state which can be achieved by cooling a @xmath126 resonator to @xmath127 .",
    "this energy scale is well below the large parameter of our model , i.e. the superconducting gap @xmath32 .",
    "when we , for instance , take an @xmath128 wire proximity coupled to an @xmath129 @xmath0-wave superconductor , the superconducting gap of @xmath129 @xmath130 can induce a superconducting gap of @xmath131 in the wire @xcite .",
