    "based on vla data , mart et al .",
    "( 1998 ) discovered a persistent non - thermal radio counterpart , associated with mildly relativistic radio jets ( paredes et al .",
    "2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "in addition , a very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-ray source was also found by the cgro / egret ( paredes et al . 2000 ) and hess ( aharonian et al . 2005 ) surveys .",
    "the observed features make ls  5039 a prominent member of the so - called gamma - ray binaries .",
    "the optical companion of the system is a bright ( v = 11.2 ) , o6.5v((f ) ) type star classified by clark et al .",

    "( hereafter m04 ) presented the first orbital parameters of the binary system .",
    "casares et al .",
    "( 2005 ; hereafter c05 ) performed a detailed spectroscopic analysis of ls  5039 , and calculated a new set of orbital and physical parameters .",
    "they found an orbital period of 3.906 days , which has been confirmed by other studies : for example , variability also in x - rays ( bosch - ramon et al . 2005 , takahashi et al . 2009 ) , at gev ( abdo et al . 2009 ) and tev energies ( aharonian et al .",
    "2006 ) occurs with the same period , suggesting orbital modulation of the high - energy emissions .",
    "very recently , aragona et al . ( 2009 ; hereafter a09 )  using the old and some new rv points  also confirm the value of the orbital period and refined the parameters .",
    "we have organised a simultaneous campaign of most space photometry and ground - based optical spectroscopy , which was executed in july 2009 .",
    "the main goal of the project was an investigation of the system parameters ( based on a new , independent , high - resolution data set ) , as well as an attempt to detect clumpiness in the stellar wind of the o - type star .",
    "here we report on the first results of our spectroscopic analysis , while the detailed discussion of the results of the coordinated campaign will be presented elsewhere ( sarty et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations were carried out on four nights between 2009 july 8 - 11 ( parallel to most observations ) and on three nights between august 1 - 3 , using the 2.3-m telescope of the australian national university ( anu ) equipped with an echelle spectrograph . in total , the obtained 118 spectra cover almost 40 hours and ensure a good sampling of the whole orbit .",
    "the integration times were between 900 - 1200 s , while the spectra covered the whole visual range between 3900   and 6720   .",
    "the nominal spectral resolution is @xmath1 23 000 at the h@xmath2 line , with typical snr of about 100 in 1 hour integration .",
    "all data were reduced with standard iraf tasks , including bias and flat - field corrections , cosmic ray removal , extraction of the 27 individual orders of the echelle spectra , wavelength calibration , and continuum normalization .",
    "to measure radial velocities we first generated one hour long average spectra to get higher s / n  one hour corresponds to 0.01 orbital phase , hence negligible phase smearing appears in the phased radial velocity data .",
    "the data were phased with an orbital period of 3.906 days ( c05 ) and our rv curve confirms that this is indeed the correct value .    to generate the final rv diagrams we used average velocities of h    i    ( h@xmath2 , h@xmath3 , h@xmath0 , h@xmath4 , @xmath53835 ) , he    i    ( @xmath54471 , @xmath55875 ) and he    ii    ( @xmath54200 , @xmath54686 , @xmath55411 ) lines ; there are several other h and he lines in the wavelength region of our spectra , but they were too noisy or blended to use them for velocity determination .",
    "the typical measurement error is @xmath610 - 15 km s@xmath7 , which is partly caused by the observational noise , partly by the large rotational velocity of the o - type star ( @xmath8 sin @xmath9 = 113 @xmath6 8 km s@xmath7 , c05 ) .",
    "our results indicate that there is a large systematic shift between he    ii    , he    i    and h balmer lines : the h    i    and he    i    lines are always blueshifted by about 20 km s@xmath7 in respect to the he    ii    lines , which is a characteristic signature of a strong stellar wind .",
    "the photosphere of the o - type star is too hot for the h    i    and he    i    lines ( @xmath10 40 000 k ) , hence these are generated in the cooler outer regions .",
    "interestingly , this velocity difference between the different species and ionisation states has not always been taken into account : c05 also examined this effect ( but they found smaller differences between velocities ) , but it was simply neglected by a09 .",
    "we also measured equivalent widths of several interstellar lines to estimate the rate of interstellar reddening ( see section 3.2 ) . during that we found redshifted satellite absorptions in the ca    ii    k and na    i    d1 & d2 lines with a radial velocity around + 60 km / s ( more precisely , + 58.4 @xmath6 2.2 km s@xmath7 by ca k , + 62.9 @xmath6 2.3 km s@xmath7 by na d1 and + 61.9 @xmath6 1.7 km s@xmath7 by na d2 ) .",
    "these satellite lines may belong to a formerly unknown galactic intermediate velocity cloud ( ivc ; see a review in wakker & van woerden 1997 ) .      in the following analysis we adopted @xmath11 = 39 000 @xmath6 1000 k and log @xmath12 = 3.85 @xmath6 0.10 for the stellar companion ( c05 ) . to determine interstellar reddening we used na    i    d1 ( @xmath13 = 0.70 @xmath6 0.02 ",

    "using other photometric parameters ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , see c05 and references therein ) we also confirmed the distance ( @xmath17 = 2.5 @xmath6 0.1 kpc ) , stellar radius ( @xmath18 = 9.3@xmath19 r@xmath20 ) and mass of the o star ( @xmath21 = 22.9@xmath22 m@xmath20 ) published by c05 .",
    "radial velocity curves were modelled using the 2003 version of the wilson - devinney ( wd ) code ( wilson & devinney 1971 , wilson & van hamme 2003 ) .",
    "we note that during the analysis we only used our own velocity points , which are independent from any previous data in the literature , and constitute the highest resolution , homogenous spectral dataset ever used to get the orbital solution of ls  5039 .",
    "the determined orbital parameters are shown in table  [ orbitpar ] , compared to results of c05 and a09 .",
    "the ones published by c05 were based only on velocity points related to he    ii    lines , while a09 combined the velocities of every available h , he    i    , and he    ii    lines ( see our cautionary notes above ) .    in general ,",
    "our parameters are close to previous solutions , but there are some differences .",
    "the value of @xmath23 is definetly higher in c05 than in a09 or in our paper .",
    "the possibility of a real change in this parameter during only some years is very small , so the reason of the difference could be effect from different data treatment in of c05 .",
