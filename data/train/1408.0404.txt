    "in the last thirty years there have been much theoretical and experimental work concerning electronic transport through multiterminal devices ( see refs .",
    "@xcite there in ) . nowadays ,",
    "the interest to study the electronic transport properties on these devices has been renewed  @xcite , due to the fact that they are very useful in experimental measurements in several configurations  @xcite .",
    "the earlier experiments were done with normal metal conductors , whose random distribution of impurities in their microscopic structure , give rise to interference that is reflected in the relevant physical observables , like resistance or voltage measurements . moreover , those quantities show sample to sample fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the interest on these systems has resurged due to recent advances in technology , that allow to access to clean devices , where the typical size is smaller than the elastic mean free path .",
    "therefore , the electrons propagate ballistically and scattering is produced only by the device boundaries , which have important consequences in the electronic transport through the device  @xcite .",
    "for instance , when the geometry is such that the classical dynamics in the system is chaotic , the transport properties fluctuates too  @xcite .",
    "what is very important is to know how are the fluctuations with respect to the disordered case .    in this work , by numerical simulation , we analyze the statistical distribution of the voltage drop along a chaotic wire , which consists of two chaotic mesoscopic cavities connected by a perfect conductor with one open mode .",
    "the probe is a chaotic cavity that measure the voltage in different configurations .",
    "the presence and absence of time reversal invariance are considered .",
    "we compare our results with the ones obtained in an equivalent three terminal device but with disordered , instead of chaotic , wires , previously studied in the literature , where the distribution of the voltage drop was determined in the presence of time reversal invariance only  @xcite . there , a remarkable difference in the distribution of the voltage drop between the ballistic regime and the strong disordered limit , has been found .",
    "the position of the probe has a stronger effect than in the disordered case .",
    "first , we summarize the scattering formalism for the voltage drop in a three terminal device , proposed by bttiker  @xcite . then",
    ", we construct the scattering matrix for our system , in terms of the scattering matrices of the individual cavities , as well as of the scattering matrix associated to the junction , for which we assume the simplest model introduced by bttiker , that couple the probe symmetrically to the horizontal wire  @xcite . for the statistical analysis",
    ", we make an ensemble of systems by assuming that the scattering matrix of each cavity is chosen from a circular ensemble , orthogonal or unitary , depending on the presence or absence of time reversal invariance .",
    "we present our conclusions at the end .",
    "in the formulation of landauer - bttiker , the electronic transport is reduced to a scattering problem . in a single mode multiprobe devices , the current @xmath0 in a lead @xmath1",
    "can be written into two components , one being the reflection to the same lead and the transmission from the others leads to the lead @xmath1 .",
    "that is , @xmath0 is given in terms of the reflection and transmission coefficients , according to  @xcite @xmath2 , \\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the chemical potential in lead @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the reflection coefficient to the lead @xmath1 , and @xmath6 represent the transmission from lead @xmath4 to lead @xmath1 .",
    "these coefficients are given by the scattering matrix @xmath7 as @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the _ voltage _ along a horizontal wire , connected via perfect leads to two reservoirs of fixed chemical potentials , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , can be measured in a three terminal device , where the third wire is in a voltage measurement configuration ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : figura1 ] ) ; that is , the chemical potential @xmath12 is such that the current through it is equal to zero , @xmath13 . in such a case",
    "@xcite , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is given by @xmath16    equation  ( [ eq : chemical ] ) shows that the chemical potential @xmath12 has an averaged part , that comes from the effect of the resorvoirs @xmath17 and @xmath18 only .",
    "the second part gives the deviation from the averaged part , and depends on the intrinsic nature of the conductors through the quantity @xmath15 , that contains all the relevant information about the multiple scattering in the device .",
    "if the conductors are disordered or chaotic , @xmath15 fluctuates between -1 and 1 , since @xmath12 can not reach the values @xmath17 nor @xmath18 due to the contact resistance  @xcite .",
    "the disordered three terminal device was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in what follows",
    "we will consider a three terminal device where the conductors are chaotic . since @xmath15 depends on the scattering matrix @xmath7 of the whole system , we construct @xmath7 in terms of the scattering matrices of each conductor and the scattering matrix of the splitter , that we will assume to be known . for the splitter",
    "we assume a simple model , while the scattering matrices of the chaotic conductors are chosen from an ensemble of random matrices that satisfy certain symmetry requirements .",
    "is denoted by @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , while @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) denotes the amplitude at the junction .",
    "each wire is described by a @xmath23 scattering matrix @xmath24 and the junction by a @xmath25 matrix , @xmath26.,width=340 ]",
    "let us consider the three terminal system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figura1 ] .",
    "the system is described by the scattering matrix @xmath7 which relates the incoming plane waves amplitudes on each terminal , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , to the outgoing ones , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , by @xmath33 where we assume that @xmath7 contains all the information that from the system we can obtain .",
    "of course , @xmath7 depends on the scattering process inside the system , due to scattering elements .",
    "let assume that the splitter is represented by the scattering matrix @xmath34 , that couples the three terminals ; therefore , the amplitudes at the junction are related as @xmath35 if the conductors on each terminal are represented by the scattering matrices @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , the amplitudes are related as follows : @xmath38 where each matrix @xmath36 is a @xmath39 matrix with the general structure @xmath40 with @xmath41 , @xmath42 are the reflection and transmission amplitudes when the incidence is from the left ( or below for @xmath43 ) of the @xmath4th conductor , and @xmath44 , @xmath45 when the incidence is from the other side .",
    "flux conservation implies that @xmath36 is unitary , @xmath46 where @xmath47 stands for the @xmath39 identity matrix .",
    "equation ( [ eq : properties ] ) is the only requirement in absence of any symmetry , while in the presence of _ time reversal invariance _ , @xmath36 is a unitary and _ symmetric _ , @xmath48 where @xmath49 stands for the transposed .    through eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ssplitter ] ) , ( [ eq : sj ] ) and ( [ eq : scavities ] ) we arrive to the scattering matrix @xmath7 that describes the full system , which is given by @xmath50 where we have defined @xmath51 equation ( [ eq : sfull ] ) has a nice interpretation : the first term on the right hand side , @xmath52 , represents the reflected parts of the waves that reach the conductors , while the second term comes from the multiple scattering in the system . here , @xmath53 gives the transmission from outside to inside , @xmath54 gives the transmission from inside to outside of the system , and @xmath55 represents the internal reflections .",
    "notice that @xmath7 is also a unitary matrix once we ensure that @xmath34 is chosen as a unitary matrix too , and the symmetry conditions are fixed by the symmetry properties of the @xmath36 s .",
    "although our result is general , in what follows we adopt a simple model for @xmath34 and we choose @xmath36 from an ensemble of scattering matrices that simulates chaotic cavities .      a simple model for the @xmath7-matrix of the splitter , real and symmtric , that couples the probe _ symmetrically _ , was proposed by bttiker  @xcite , namely @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a real parameters with @xmath58 , which gives the coupling strength , and @xmath59 when the coupling vanishes ( @xmath60 ) , @xmath61 and @xmath62 which means that the probe is decoupled and there is complete transmission between the terminals 1 and 2 . on the contrary , when the probe is perfectly coupled ( @xmath63 ) , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , nothing is reflected to the probe .",
    "we assume that the conductors in our device are in fact chaotic cavities , such that the voltage measurement , and any other transport properties , shows sample to sample fluctuations , although macroscopically seems to be identical ; this is due to the difficulty of control of the shape of the cavity microscopically . of course",
    ", the fluctuations also arise with respect to external parameters like the chemical potentials and magnetic field .",
    "therefore , we require to make a statistical study for the voltage measurement .",
    "we do this for two kind of ensembles for the @xmath36 matrices : in presence and absence of time reversal symmetry . in the dyson s scheme",
    "these correspond to the orthogonal and unitary cases , labeled by @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively  @xcite .      in the @xmath66 symmetry",
    ", an @xmath24 matrix can be parameterized in a `` polar representation '' as  @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are random numbers , uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath71 $ ] , and @xmath72 is randomly distributed in @xmath73 $ ] .",
    "the probability distribution for @xmath36 is  @xcite @xmath74 which defines the _ circular orthogonal ensemble _ , which can be generated numerically .",
    "once this is done , we substitute the elements of the @xmath36 matrices in the expressions given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pq ] ) , and then in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sfull ] ) from which we obtain the transmission coefficients @xmath75 and @xmath76 , needed to determine @xmath15 through eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) .",
    "the numerical results for the distribution of @xmath15 , for several values of the coupling strength @xmath57 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] for different measurement configurations .",
    "panels ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) of this figure are the most general cases of voltage measurements with respect to the position , where all conductors are chaotic .",
    "we can observe a clear dependence on the position of the probe . in panel",
    "( a ) , the probe is in the middle of the horizontal wire , and the distribution of @xmath15 is symmetric around zero , which means that @xmath12 fluctuates symmetrically around the average @xmath77 .",
    "however , when the position of the probe changes to one end of the horizontal wire , the distribution of @xmath15 is no more symmetric with respect to zero , as can be seen in panels ( b ) and ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] ; in fact , @xmath12 tends to be closer to the chemical potential of that terminal .",
    "we also note that the distribution of @xmath15 is independent of the coupling parameter .",
    "however , when the probe is asymmetrically located in the horizontal wire , the distribution of @xmath15 reminds that of the probe in the midpoint .",
    "we can see that our results contrast with the disordered case of refs .",
    "@xcite in both limits of weak and strong disorder .     for a chaotic three terminal device for different values of @xmath57 and configurations ( insets ) , ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) in the presence , and ( d ) ,",
    "( e ) and ( f ) in the absence , of time reversal invariance.,width=377 ]      the scattering matrix @xmath36 for the @xmath67 symmetry has the following parametrization  @xcite , @xmath78 here , the probability distribution of @xmath36 is given by  @xcite @xmath79 which defines the _ circular unitary ensemble_.    in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] , panels ( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) , we show the results for the distribution of @xmath15 for the same values of @xmath57 and configurations as in the @xmath66 case .",
    "the dependence on the intensity of the coupling , as well as in the position of the probe , is also observed . as in the @xmath66 case ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath15 is independent of @xmath57 and has memory with respect to the measurement in the midpoint of the horizontal wire .",
    "what is important to note here is that the distribution of @xmath15 is strongly affected by the broken symmetry of time reversal .",
    "we studied the voltage drop along a horizontal wire with one open mode , consisting of chaotic conductors , in a three terminal device .",
    "this was done by using a probe which is chaotic .",
    "our analysis was based on random matrix theory simulations for the chaotic elements , in the presence and absence of time reversal invariance .",
