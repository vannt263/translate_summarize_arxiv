    "there is a discrepancy between what is experimentally observed in heavy ion collisions @xcite , and theoretical computations of photon emission from a thermalized quark gluon plasma ( tqgp ) @xcite .",
    "computations using realistic equations of state and state of the art computations of photon emission from the tqgp give results whose slope in @xmath0 is too shallow ( falls too slowly in @xmath0 ) and is about a factor of 4 smaller than the observed rate @xcite .    even more significant",
    "is the difference between theoretically computed and experimentally observed photon elliptic flow .",
    "photon emission is dominated by early times when temperatures are high and flow is not yet built up .",
    "this early time emission in theoretical calculations leads to a significant under - estimation of elliptic flow compared to experimental data .",
    "this has led to suggestions that the photon rate may be due to late time hadronic processes where the spectrum of photons is enhanced by radial flow effects @xcite .",
    "this is perhaps possible but difficult , as it involves rates for photon production that are quite large , and for @xmath1 photons requires substantial lorentz boosts of fundamental emission processes .    on the other hand",
    ", a recent analysis shows that the photon spectrum measured at rhic and lhc for p+p , d+au , au+au collisions at rhic energy and pb+pb collisions at lhc is well described by the geometric scaling hypothesis @xcite .",
    "this follows from theories of gluon saturation , and should be preserved when the expansion is scale invariant , suggesting that the photons are emitted early in time when particle masses are not important . however , one faces the problem of photon flow , an effect which takes a time of the order the transverse size of the colliding region to set in .",
    "in this paper we suggest that a description of the photon spectrum , in particular the photon flow , should be based on the picture that the early dynamics of the collision are described by a glasma , not a thermalized quark gluon plasma .",
    "photon emission from the glasma was considered in a previous work @xcite .",
    "following recent developments @xcite , we will assume that the glasma is described by hydrodynamic equations with perhaps some asymmetry between longitudinal and transverse pressure @xcite .",
    "we fully understand that the assumption that the glasma expands hydrodynamically with near perfect fluid behavior is contentious , and as well not much is known from first principles concerning the distributions of gluons in the glasma @xcite",
    ". we will nevertheless proceed assuming that such near perfect fluid behavior is true , and use the simplest possible model , developed in this paper , to describe the quarks and gluon distributions in the glasma .",
    "hopefully with deeper understanding the semi - quantitative conclusions found here survive a much more sophisticated treatment .",
    "hadron distributions are generated at late times during decoupling , and are affected little by the glasma , except as a remnant of hydrodynamic expansion .",
    "photon emission is however different .",
    "in addition to knowledge of the bulk dynamics , one needs to know the quark and gluon distribution functions as a function of the energy density of the system at early and intermediate times in order to compute the distribution of emitted photons .",
    "we argue that these distribution functions and their time evolution can be quite different between the tqgp and the glasma .    a qualitative effect we find is related to the two scales that characterize gluon distributions in the glasma .",
    "there is an ultraviolet scale @xmath2 above which distributions become dilute and an infrared scale @xmath3 at which the distributions are highly coherent . for a thermal system ,",
    "the uv scale is the temperature , and the ir scale is the magnetic has @xmath4 . in the glasma at the initial time , both the infrared and uv scale are equal and are proportional to the saturation momentum .",
    "( within our analysis , we determine the numerical relation between these initial scales and the saturation momentum . )",
    "as time evolves these scales split apart .",
    "thermalization can begin when these scales reach @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "( in the later analysis we will make this criterion more precise . ) for a thermal system , the temperature scale decreases approximately as @xmath6 .",
    "however , for the glasma , we will show below that the infrared scale decreases more rapidly than this but the uv scale decreases more slowly . such evolution",
    "is slowed down even more if there is an asymmetry between longitudinal and transverse pressure .",
    "therefore , if we start both the glasma and the tqgp from the same initial ultraviolet energy scale , it will take longer in the glasma to reach the same ultraviolet energy scale at a lower value .",
    "we will show that this has several consequences : the shape of the photon distribution is changed and the typical time for photon emission increases .",
    "the story for us is a bit more complicated however , as when one properly models both the glasma and the tqgp , the initial temperature for the tqgp must be different from that of the glasma , in order that they can match together at thermalization .",
    "in addition the photons are emitted both from the glasma at earlier times and the tqgp at later times .",
    "we find nevertheless , that the presence of an early time glasma slows the emission process for photons , and steepens the spectrum of produced photons . for small asymmetry between the longitudinal and transverse pressure ,",
    "we find significant steepening of the photon spectrum and significantly longer times of photon emission .",
    "this longer emission time will allow for elliptic flow effects to become important , since flow develops on time scales of the order of the size of the system , which is parametrically large compared to the time scale set by the inverse saturation momentum .",
    "these effects point in the correct direction but they may not be sufficient to fix the problem when these simple computations presented here are realized in realistic hydrodynamical or glasma simulations",
    ". the simple considerations in this paper may nevertheless be useful in guiding such more detailed computations , where the answer to the photon puzzle can be ultimately resolved .",
    "of course our simple results automatically satisfy geometric scaling , and to what degree this is maintained in more detailed computations remains to be seen .",
    "such scaling is however very general and should be true in ideal gas hydrodynamic models where the initial time is specified as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the initial temperature .",
    "in such a circumstance , the initial temperatures is determined by the multiplicity and is proportional to the saturation momentum .",
    "the scaling follows because no dimensional scale is introduced in the hydrodynamic expansion .",
    "we begin with a simple model of the glasma evolution . we will assume the distribution function for gluons in the glasma to be of the form @xmath9 in this equation , the constant @xmath10 is of order 1 .",
    "this distribution becomes a thermal gluon distribution function when the the infrared scale satisfies @xmath11 this is the separation of scales in a thermal system for the relation between the magnetic mass scale and the temperature . at the magnetic mass scale configurations in the quark gluon",
    "plasma become non - perturbative . for @xmath12",
    "this distribution is a classical thermal distribution , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "it is cut off at the scale @xmath2 . before reaching the thermalization scale",
    ", this distribution represents an over - occupation of gluonic states . for the time being , we will assume that the quarks and gluons are massless , and that the distribution functions are isotropic .",
    "the distribution @xmath15 can be shown to follow from a statistical matrix @xmath16 , which is a generalization of the partition function .",
    "@xmath17 where @xmath18 the gluon distribution then follows via @xmath19    for the quarks , we take @xmath20 there is no enhancement for the quark degrees of freedom because they are fermions , as there can be no multiple occupation of fermion states .    the entropy associated with these distributions is @xmath21    using distributions ( [ eq : gluons ] ) and ( [ eq : quarks ] ) to express the energy density , pressures , and number densities in terms of the quantities @xmath2 and @xmath3 we find @xmath22 for gluons and @xmath23 for quarks , where @xmath24 is the number of light quark flavors .",
    "the numbers of quarks and gluons are @xmath25 and @xmath26    it is amusing that the entropy for the gluons is not of order @xmath27 .",
    "the disappearance of this factor is because the leading order term which is associated with a classical field cancels .",
    "the classical term comes when @xmath15 is large , and in this limit the first and second terms in our expression for the entropy are both of order @xmath28 and they cancel .",
    "one picks up the non leading term in the entropy density @xmath29 , so that the entropy is of order @xmath30 .",
    "this means that the entropy of the initial state is low compared to the gluon number density , @xmath31 . at thermalization , when @xmath32 , the number density and entropy density are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "conformal invariance of the presented expressions guarantees that @xmath33 for isotropic distributions , and this is satisfied for our expressions",
    "..    we will also be interested in the case where there is a momentum anisotropy .",
    "we can introduce such an anisotropy into the momentum distributions of the particles , using that the longitudinal pressure is taken to be @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "this will modify the expansion dynamics through the evolution equation which follows from @xmath36 dimensional hydrodynamics , @xmath37 this will have the energy density fall as @xmath38",
    ".    the corresponding modification of the momentum distributions can be parametrized by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the direction of the anisotropy and @xmath41 characterizes its strength @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we find the relation @xmath42 note that @xmath43 and @xmath44 as it should be . for @xmath45",
    "this leads to a particle number reduced by a factor of @xmath46 @xcite . in our computations",
    ", we will consider a fixed momentum anisotropy .",
    "this is slightly different from what is done in standard hydrodynamic computations , where the viscosity to entropy density ratio , @xmath47 is taken to be a constant . in our case , we interpret this ratio as scattering time divided by a thermal wavelength , @xmath48 .",
    "we will argue in the next section that the scattering time for the out of equilibrium glasma is proportional to the time , @xmath49 . in this case",
    ", the expression derived from hydrodynamics becomes @xmath50",
    "the parameter @xmath51 can be determined by knowing the ratio of the initial number of gluons to quarks in the hadron wavefunction . at the initial time",
    ", we have @xmath52 .",
    "the ratio of the total number of gluons to quarks and antiquarks of all flavors is therefore @xmath53 where @xmath24 is the number of quark flavor degrees of freedom important at the saturation momentum scale .",
    "we will take @xmath54 ignoring the effects of charm quarks .    in the mstw parton distribution functions",
    "@xcite , there is about an order of magnitude difference between the number of up quarks and the number of gluons , so that @xmath55 taking @xmath56 , this suggests that @xmath57 .    the way that the time evolution is computed is from identifying the time with the collision time in the transport equations @xcite .",
    "dimensional arguments give @xmath58 we further use that the energy density scales according to the hydrodynamic equations as @xmath59 .",
    "the factor of @xmath60 allows for an asymmetry between longitudinal and transverse pressure as discussed above .",
    "recent numerical results suggest that @xmath60 might be close to @xmath61 , corresponding to equal longitudinal and transverse pressures @xcite .",
    "we will allow for some anisotropy in our analysis , but in fact find a good description of the photon spectrum and significant increase in emission times with @xmath62 .    using the expression for the energy density in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , eqs.([eq : edengluons ] ) and ( [ eq : edenquarks ] ) , we can determine the evolution of these energy scales .",
    "note that this can also be done directly from results for @xmath63 obtained from hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we do not need to require a power law in time .    nevertheless , the simplified structure we get when we assume a power law in time for the evolution of the energy density makes it useful to consider .",
    "let us first assume that in the glasma phase the evolution is dominated by the gluons and that the coupling constant is fixed .",
    "then we find @xmath64 and @xmath65 note that the ultraviolet scale which corresponds roughly to a temperature falls less rapidly than is the case for a thermal system .    for a thermally equilibrated system @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "let us consider how flow would affect a thermal system .",
    "let us ask what flow ensues if we are at some fixed temperature t. for a thermal system , the initial temperature is given in terms of the particle multiplicity as @xmath68 then @xmath69 where in this equation @xmath70 is the center of mass energy per nucleon . from this",
    "we learn that processes at a fixed temperature will happen at a time which scales like the radius of the system and the fourth root of the beam energy . on the other hand flow effects will become important at a time of order @xmath71 .",
    "so given a fixed temperature scale , whether or not flow is important depends on how large is @xmath72 .",
    "this is independent of the size of the system .",
    "flow effects at some temperature scale are important or not depending upon how high the beam energy is and what value of @xmath73 we choose .    in the glasma , the evolution of the ultraviolet scale is slower than the evolution of the temperature for the tqgp . in the gluon dominated case",
    "the uv scale , for @xmath74 , cools off as @xmath75 , with the exponent @xmath76 , which is always less than a third .",
    "however , when @xmath77 , we reach the thermalization time @xmath78 for the range of @xmath60 at hand , @xmath79 , and using @xmath80 and @xmath81 , we find that thermalization may occur at a time of 1 - 2 orders of magnitude larger than that of the initial time scale @xmath82 .",
    "this can correspond to quite large times of order @xmath83 .",
    "for the case of @xmath84 , the energy density of the tqgp and that of the glasma decrease at the same rate .",
    "so when the system thermalizes , it thermalizes at the same temperature .",
    "however , the time it has taken to get to this scale is longer for the glasma because it took a longer time to evolve to this scale .",
    "this is consistent because the initial temperature of the tqgp phase was higher than that of the glasma . on the other hand for @xmath85 ,",
    "the situation is a bit more complicated .",
    "energy densities at the thermalization time must be equal , but because the glasma is anisotropic , the average temperature will be lower in the isotropic thermal system .",
    "also , the number of particles will not be conserved .",
    "for the cases we consider these effects are small but they must be taken into account .",
    "including gluons and quarks , for general @xmath60 in the glasma case we need to solve @xmath86 numerically for @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath88 follows from @xmath89 .",
    "the initial values @xmath90 and @xmath91 are chosen to fulfill the requirement of energy conservation when thermalizing at the time @xmath92 , which is the time when @xmath93 ( see eq.([eq : eta ] ) ) is equal to @xmath94 .",
    "the energy density in the thermal case is given by @xmath95 while in the glasma we have @xmath96 where @xmath97 $ ] , which results from having an anisotropic momentum distribution in the case of general @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath41 can be obtained from the relation ( [ eq : deltaxi ] ) for a given @xmath60 .",
    "given an initial temperature @xmath8 , the requirement @xmath98 can be fulfilled by iteratively solving for the initial @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the particle number in the thermal case is constant in time and given by @xmath101 in the glasma the particle number depends on time and we need to evaluate the expression @xmath102 at time @xmath103 . for @xmath104 expressions ( [ eq : dndytherm ] ) and ( [ eq : dndyglasma ] ) agree at time @xmath92 . for general @xmath60",
    "there will be a difference due to the anisotropic momentum distributions in the glasma expressions .    for collisions at lhc energies",

    "the generalized rates taking this anisotropy into account have been computed in @xcite . because here we are focusing on the effect of the energy scales and not on the rapidity dependence of photon production this approximation is appropriate .",
    "we further use the fact that the gluon distribution in the initial or final state is large compared to 1 .",
    "this leads to the simple form ( [ eq : glasmarate ] ) where we get an additional factor @xmath116 from the gluon distribution .",
    "we chose the factor under the logarithm in the glasma rate as to make the rates equal at the time of thermalization when @xmath117 .",

    "we also include a curve assuming glasma emission for the entire lifetime of the system .",

    "mean emission times that are significantly larger ( as is the case for e.g. @xmath129 photons ) indicate that a large fraction of photons are produced in a thermalized system , as we expected from the photon distribution shown in fig.[fig : photonyield ] .    the slower expansion for @xmath109 causes emission times to increase , except at the lowest photon energies , where @xmath130 is smaller than for @xmath104 .",
    "this is because for @xmath109 thermalization is reached at a slightly earlier time than for @xmath104 .",
    "furthermore , because of the anisotropy , the rates make a small jump down at the thermalization time . at higher photon energies ,",

    "the later photon emission times for a system that undergoes evolution through a glasma phase can have an important effect on the photon elliptic flow .",
