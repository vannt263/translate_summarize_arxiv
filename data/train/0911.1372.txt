    "a low - loss nanoscale all - optical switch  @xcite could revolutionize photonics through its compatibility with proposed nanophotonic structures , speed , and efficacy at low light levels .",
    "although such a device is needed , its creation has been prevented by the poor trade - off between confinement of light and losses and the incompatibility of low light levels with strong kerr nonlinearity .",
    "some of these challenges may be ameliorated by ongoing research .",
    "for example giant cross - phase modulation ( xpm ) could be enabled by double electromagnetically induced transparency ( double eit or ` deit ' )  @xcite .",
    "furthermore surface plasmons  @xcite could exploit subwavelength optics  @xcite , albeit with large losses that may be lessened by clever strategies  @xcite .    we show that , by coupling two surface polaritons ( sps ) in a deit medium situated close to an interface between a dielectric and a negative - index metamaterial ( nimm )  @xcite , such that material properties are judiciously chosen  @xcite , giant cross - phase modulation between the two sps can be achieved in a low - loss , sub - wavelength confinement regime . in particular a mutual @xmath0 phase shift between the two pulses",
    "is attainable for weak fields with a mean photon number of one , thereby opening the prospect of deterministic single - photon quantum logic gates for quantum computing  @xcite .",
    "the mutual phase shift between two pulses is achieved by creating a kerr - nonlinear refractive index simply expressed as @xmath1 for @xmath2 the linear refractive index , @xmath3 the coefficient for the nonlinear index , and  @xmath4 the intensity of the light field . for two separate field modes  @xmath5 and  @xmath6 , the mutual phase shift of  @xmath5 due to  @xmath6",
    "is phase difference experienced by  @xmath5 due to its interaction with  @xmath6 compared to the phase shift if  @xmath6 were turned off .",
    "similary , the mutual phase shift of  @xmath6 is the phase difference experienced by that mode for  @xmath5 on vs the case of  @xmath5 off .    in natural media , @xmath3 is quite small . furthermore the mutual phase shift is proportional not only to @xmath3 but also to the energy density of the field and the interaction time between the two pulses .",
    "typically interaction time is quite short , and energy density is diffraction - limited .",
    "fortunately , double electromagnetically - induced transparency combined with strongly driven cross - phase modulation simultaneously creates a large @xmath3 nonlinearity , compresses the energy of the pulse in the direction of propagation , and increases the interaction time by slowing or even stopping the pulses  @xcite .",
    "however , the resultant mutual phase shift is expected to be at best on the order of @xmath7 radians per photon squared . in other words , for modes @xmath5 and  @xmath6 with mean photon number of one , the mutual phase shift is only around @xmath7 rad , which is far too small for weak - field all - optical phase - triggered switches .",
    "one way to boost the nonlinear phase shift is to compress the field energy in the transverse direction .",
    "then all the ingredients are in place for huge mutual phase shifts between pulses  @xmath5 and  @xmath6 .",
    "transverse confinement is made possible by bringing a second medium in close proximity to the interaction region and driving this second medium . in this case ,",
    "exponential confinement of the second medium s evanescent field can produce the desired strong confinement , but there is a problem : some of the electromagnetic field energy penetrates into the second medium , whereas almost all the field energy should be in the first medium for weak - field phase - triggered all - optical switches to work .",
    "field penetration in medium  2 can be restricted for this medium being a metal : the field is then converted to a plasmon with an evanescent field that acts on the nonlinear medium located above medium  2 . using a metal",
    "has the serious drawback , though , that the plasmon is notoriously lossy .",
    "this loss must be avoided for switching to be efficient .",
    "recently we discovered that making medium  2 a negative - index metamaterial ( nimm ) rather than a dielectric or a metal combines the best field - confinement features of both .",
    "specifically it is possible to minimize losses for selected exponential confinement of the field  @xcite .",
    "thus an electromagnetic pulse excites a `` low - loss surface polariton ''  ( llsp ) in this nimm , for which dielectric permittivity  @xmath8 and magnetic permeability @xmath9 are both negative with  @xmath10 the llsp mode carrier frequency and both @xmath11 and @xmath12 dimensionless .",
    "here we show that two llsps will interact via the kerr nonlinear medium , retain their low - loss nature , and yield large mutual phase shifts ( e.g. , @xmath0 radians ) .",
    "thus , two electromagnetic pulses can effect strong mutual phase shifts , as shown in fig .",
