    "all stars are believed to possess expanding outer atmospheres known as stellar winds .",
    "continual mass loss has a significant impact on the evolution of the stars themselves , on surrounding planetary systems , and on the overall mass and energy budget of the interstellar medium ( see reviews by dupree 1986 ; lamers & cassinelli 1999 ; willson 2000 ) .",
    "we would like to understand how stellar wind properties depend on the fundamental stellar parameters and to identify the physical processes that drive the winds .",
    "observations are key , of course , and recent advances in measuring the plasma properties of our own _ solar wind _",
    "( via both remote sensing and in - situ probes ) have been helpful .",
    "there is a well - known mismatch , though , between the most basic property of the solar wind ( it s mass loss rate : @xmath0 ) and corresponding values for detectable outflows from other stars ( @xmath1 , typically ) .",
    "solar - type winds are just too tenuous to make much of an impact on star - integrated photon signatures .",
    "the goal of this paper is to summarize a cross - section of observational and theoretical work that is improving our understanding of the low - density winds from solar - type ( cool , main - sequence ) stars .",
    "the last decade has seen significant progress toward identifying and characterizing the processes that heat the solar corona and accelerate the solar wind ( see , e.g. , cranmer 2002 , 2004 ; kohl et al .",
    "2006 ; aschwanden 2006 ; klimchuk 2006 ) .",
    "it seems increasingly clear that _ closed _ magnetic loops in the low corona are heated by small - scale , intermittent magnetic reconnection that is driven by the continual stressing of their footpoints by convective motions .",
    "open _ field lines that reach into interplanetary space , though , appear to be energized by the dissipation of waves and turbulent motions ( also driven ultimately by convection ) .",
    "parker s ( 1958 ) classical paradigm of solar wind acceleration via the gas pressure gradient in a hot ( @xmath2 k ) corona still seems to be the dominant mechanism , though waves and turbulence have an impact as well .",
    "clues about the detailed process of turbulent heating have come from uv spectroscopy of the extended corona ( i.e. , using a combination of an occulting coronagraph and a spectrometer ) .",
    "there is evidence for preferential acceleration of heavy ions in the fast solar wind , ion temperatures exceeding @xmath3 k , and marked departures from maxwellian velocity distributions  all of which point to specific types of _ collisionless kinetic _ processes at the end of the turbulent cascade .",
    "the sun - integrated mass loss rate @xmath4 is a quantity that is not often considered by solar physicists , since both telescopic and in - situ measurements typically resolve much smaller volumes of plasma at a time .",
    "it is possible to use in - situ measurements of the density @xmath5 and flow speed @xmath6 to estimate a time - dependent mass flux @xmath7 ( as if the entire heliosphere is identical to the measured parcel ) .",
    "average values tend to fall around @xmath8 , with the majority of data points falling within about a factor of 3 of this value ( i.e. , the @xmath9 range is between 0.6 and @xmath10 ) ; see figure 1 . wang ( 1998 )",
    "used some well - known empirical correlations between the plasma properties measured at 1  au and the coronal magnetic field geometry ( the latter extrapolated from photospheric fields ) to reconstruct a sphere - integrated value of @xmath4 over two solar cycles .",
    "he found this `` true '' mass loss rate to vary only by about 50% , from 2 to @xmath11 , with lower [ higher ] values at solar minimum [ maximum ] .",
    "the sun s mass flux is generally believed to be determined in the thin _ transition region _ between the chromosphere and corona by a balance between downward conduction ( from the corona ) , upward enthalpy flux ( from the chromosphere ) , and local radiative losses ( e.g. , hammer 1982 ; withbroe 1988 ; leer et al .",
    "1998 ; leer & marsch 1999 ) .",
    "essentially , _ more coronal heating implies more mass loss .",
    "_ alternate ideas , such as alfvn wave pressure acceleration ( holzer et al .   1983 ) and a dynamic balance between ionization and recombination in the chromosphere ( peter & marsch 1997 ) ,",
    "have an impact on the mass flux but do not seem to be the dominant drivers . from a modeling perspective , it has been realized that it is key to resolve the full range of radii  from the nearly hydrostatic chromosphere to the supersonic wind  in order to simulate a self - consistent flow along the open flux tube .",
    "figure 2 shows a summary of @xmath4 determinations from a wide variety of stars .",
    "the sources of these data are given below ; when @xmath12 or @xmath13 were not provided , they were determined from spectral types and luminosity classes using the relations of de jager & nieuwenhuijzen ( 1987 ) .",
    "uncertainty limits are not shown in figure 2 , but it is clear that the sources of potential error increase dramatically as the methods grow increasingly _ model - dependent . _ by necessity , this occurs as the derived values of @xmath4 decrease . note also that figure 2 omits observations of `` bursty '' mass loss episodes ( implied for , e.g. , some m - dwarf flare stars ; mullan et al .",
    "1992 ) as well as jets associated with interacting binaries ; the goal is to include only time - steady mass loss from individual stars .",
    "the circles in figure 2 correspond to the de jager et al .",
    "( 1988 ) database of evolved stars , with mass loss rates derived largely from four main techniques :    1 .   _",
    "optical and uv spectroscopy : _ blueshifted absorption lines probe the column of outflowing gas in front of the stellar disk .",
    "if the wind is dense enough , there may also be a line - centered emission component indicative of `` off - limb '' expansion ; i.e. , a p cygni profile .",
    "if the wind is too tenuous , the line opacity is dominated by the more - or - less static photosphere . for most lines ,",
    "deriving @xmath4 is possible only in combination with a model atmosphere having an assumed ionization balance .",
    "2 .   _ ir continuum excess : _ for cool stars , circumstellar dust gives rise to a measurable continuum enhancement in the infrared .",
    "the gas - to - dust ratio and the outflow speed must be assumed in order to obtain @xmath4 .",
    "3 .   _ molecular lines : _ for the densest outflows ( @xmath14 ) , molecular emission lines ( from , e.g. , co , oh , cn , cs ) at mm and sub - mm wavelengths have provided accurate outflow speeds and mass loss rates in the `` shells '' far from the parent stars . sometimes enough information is present to piece together details about the mass loss histories of some stars  i.e . , more than just the first derivative of @xmath15 .",
    "radio continuum excess : _ ionized plasma in an outflowing atmosphere emits in the radio via bremsstrahlung . the ionization state and the outflow speed must be assumed in order to obtain @xmath4 .    for more information on these techniques ,",
    "see references cited by de jager et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and judge & stencel ( 1991 ) .    in the 1990s ,",
    "more self - consistent analyses of visible and uv spectra began to be performed , thanks to both increasingly sophisticated radiative transfer models and better data ( e.g. , _ fuse , _",
    "ghrs/_hst , _ and high spectral resolution ground - based instruments ) .",
    "the squares in figure 2 highlight @xmath4 determinations from dupree et al .",
    "( 1990 , 2005 ) , harper et al .   (",
    "1995 ) , robinson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , carpenter et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and lobel & dupree ( 2000 ) .",
    "also included are several additional values of @xmath4 from judge & stencel ( 1991 ) determined using the above traditional techniques , which do not overlap with the de jager et al .",
    "( 1988 ) database ( and are not chemically peculiar ) .",
    "the diamonds in figure 2 illustrate outflows from t  tauri stars as determined from optical forbidden line profiles ( hartigan et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "more recently , several other new diagnostic techniques have been explored that attempt to push the lower limit of detectability down past the solar mass loss rate .",
    "wood et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2004 , 2005 ) used high - resolution _ hst _ spectra of h  i ly@xmath16 lines from nearby stars to characterize the properties of their so - called `` astrospheres . '' the interaction between a fully ionized stellar wind and the partially ionized local interstellar medium ( lism ) gives rise to a dense concentration of neutral hydrogen atoms between the bow shock and astropause .",
    "this `` hydrogen wall '' ( @xmath17 k ) is hotter than the exterior lism gas ( @xmath18 k ) and thus shows up as an absorption component on the blue side of the h  i ly@xmath16 line .",
    "the density in the hydrogen wall is proportional to the wind s mass loss rate , and wood et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2004 , 2005 ) have calibrated this diagnostic using multi - fluid hydrodynamic models .",
    "the up - pointing triangles in figure 2 show the derived mass loss rates from wood et al .",
    "these @xmath4 determinations are are somewhat controversial , though , because they depend sensitively on : ( 1 ) astrosphere models that can not be verified for the individual stars , and ( 2 ) modeled interstellar absorption in the core and wings of the intrinsic ( and unobserved ) stellar ly@xmath16 profile .",
    "improvements in the dynamical and radiative transfer models should help reduce the uncertainties .",
    "another new technique for determining the mass loss rates of some m dwarfs in pre - cataclysmic - variable binary systems was suggested by debes ( 2006 ) .",
    "some h - rich white dwarfs show metal lines in their atmospheric spectra that would be difficult to maintain ( against downward diffusion ) if the metal - rich gas were not being continually accreted .",
    "debes ( 2006 ) computed the accretion rates by comparing the observed strengths of ca  ii h and k lines to models that predict the balance between mass addition and downward ca `` settling . ''",
    "the inter - binary density is then computed by assuming the accretion takes place via standard bondi - hoyle transonic flow , and this density is then used to compute the companion star s mass loss rate .",
    "the wind speed @xmath6 is an assumed quantity in this analysis , and the derived mass loss rate depends sensitively on @xmath19 .",
    "the down - pointing triangles in figure 2 show derived @xmath4 values for the three close binaries analyzed by debes ( 2006 ) .",
    "the three other ( wider ) binary systems studied by debes ( 2006 ) have much larger inferred mass loss rates , but these values are uncertain to within at least 2 orders of magnitude , and there are inconsistencies between these values and the evolutionary histories of these systems that lend doubt to the results .    finally , there is another suggested technique that at present has yielded only upper limits on mass loss rates .",
    "wargelin & drake ( 2001 , 2002 ) suggested that the winds of nearby dwarf stars may be detectable via x - rays induced by charge exchange .",
    "interstellar hydrogen flows into stellar astrospheres and undergoes charge exchange with ions in the supersonic wind ; these ions are left in an excited state and emit x - rays . because the charge exchange rate is proportional to the product of the ions density and velocity , the x - ray emission is sensitive to the stellar mass loss rate . with good enough spatial and spectral resolution ( which may not be achievable until the _ generation - x _ mission ) this diagnostic",
    "can also be used to constrain the wind s velocity , elemental composition , and ionization state .",
    "theoretical explanations for cool - star mass loss tend to follow various components of the _ energy flux _ from the stellar interior up through the atmosphere .",
    "reimers ( 1975 , 1977 ) assumed the stellar wind luminosity ( or wind power ) remains proportional to the bolometric photon luminosity as cool stars evolve ; i.e. , that @xmath20 schrder & cuntz ( 2005 ) obtained a similar relation by assuming that the wind s energy flux is set by the turbulent transfer of subphotospheric convective energy to photospheric wave motions ( see the curves in figure 2 for a comparison between the observed @xmath4 values and those from the schrder & cuntz scaling law )",
    ". models of wave generation from turbulent convection have been used to model chromospheric and coronal heating in the sun and other stars .",
    "the connections between coronal heating and stellar winds can be utilized to obtain a better empirical understanding of mass loss .",
    "the primary observational signature of coronal heating  x - ray emission  is seen in a much larger fraction of cool stars than those that have measured mass loss rates . as models of the solar corona and wind",
    "improve in sophistication and become less dependent on free parameters , it may be possible to extend them to other stars and determine ( albeit still in a model - dependent way ) consistent ranges of wind properties for stars with measured x - ray fluxes .",
    "taking the assumption that coronal heating causes mass loss , there appear to be two primary roadblocks in the way of producing reliable models for solar - type stars :    1 .",
    "mass loss proceeds along _ open _ magnetic flux tubes , but the dominant x - ray emission comes from _ closed _ magnetic loops . for very active stars , is there any hope of extracting the x - ray signature of just the `` dim '' open regions ? if the heating in the open regions is related causally to the ( more observable ) heating in the closed regions , though , the latter may scale with the former . a combination of diagnostics  not just x - rays  appears to be needed in order to put separate constraints on the open and closed magnetic regions .",
    "2 .   for the open flux tubes ,",
    "there is still disagreement in the solar community on the extent that coronal heating is driven by `` magnetic activity '' ( i.e. , simply proportional to some positive power of the magnetic flux at the base of the corona ) or by the wave fluxes at the stellar surface ( presumably determined by convection ) .",
    "cranmer et al .   ( 2007 ) produced a model of chromospheric and coronal heating along open flux tubes that reproduces a wide range of observations of fast and slow solar wind streams ; these models depend on a _ combination _ of the magnetic and wave parameters ( see also schwadron & mccomas 2003 ; suzuki 2006a ) .",
    "rapidly rotating active stars appear to have stronger magnetic fields than the sun ( e.g. , saar 2001 ) and they may also have more vigorous convection ( kpyl et al .",
    "2006 ; brown et al .   2007 ) .",
    "an interesting testbed for the above issues is the age dependence of solar - type stars ",
    "i.e . , the `` sun in time . ''",
    "figure 3a shows a selection of x - ray luminosities ( in units of the stars bolometric luminosities ) as a function of age .",
    "the @xmath21 values were either measured in the rosat / pspc - like 0.12.4 kev band or converted into that band .",
    "values from individual stars were taken from gdel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and garca - alvarez et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ; the cluster means come from preibisch & feigelson ( 2005 ) and jeffries et al .",
    "the solar range of values ( error bar at @xmath22 gyr ) is from judge et al .",
    "the fit shown with a dashed line is given by @xmath23    there have been several attempts to scale mass loss rates with stellar x - ray fluxes @xmath24 ( or luminosities @xmath21 ) and with magnetic field fluxes @xmath25 .",
    "the latter two quantities are well - known to be nearly linearly correlated for the sun , over the solar cycle , as well as for a range of other cool stars ; i.e. , @xmath26 , with @xmath271.1 ( e.g. , pevtsov et al .   2003 ; schrijver et al .",
    "astrospheric mass loss rates were used by wood et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2004 , 2005 ) to correlate @xmath24 with @xmath4 .",
    "values of the scaling exponent @xmath28 ranged from @xmath29 to 1.3 depending on the subset of stars used in the correlation .",
    "the wood et al .",
    "database was analyzed in a different way by holzwarth & jardine ( 2007 ) , who found a weaker relationship between @xmath24 and @xmath4 ( @xmath30 ) by constructing fast - magnetic - rotator type models of the winds and separating out several k dwarfs from the sample that appear to have anomalously high mass loss rates .",
    "small values of @xmath31 can also be derived by returning to the solar analogy .",
    "note that the sun s total mass loss rate varies relatively weakly over the solar cycle ( i.e. , by about 50% , as computed by wang 1998 ) , whereas its magnetic flux varies by at least two orders of magnitude over the cycle .",
    "schwadron et al .   ( 2006 ) separated the magnetic flux variation into `` active region '' ( ar ) and `` quiet sun '' ( qs ) components based on magnetic field models .",
    "for the years between 1985 and 1997 , we cross - correlated the wang ( 1998 ) mass loss data against the schwadron et al .",
    "( 2006 ) magnetic flux curves . assuming @xmath32 ( to convert @xmath25 into @xmath24 ) , we found @xmath33 for ar , and @xmath34 for qs . in a sense , these are `` apples - and - oranges '' comparisons , since the closed - field ar and qs regions do not connect directly to the solar wind .",
    "schwadron et al .   (",
    "2006 ) also computed the `` coronal hole '' ( i.e. , open field ) component of the magnetic field , but did not show the considerably weaker @xmath24 or @xmath25 variations that would be attributed to these regions .",
    "presumably these would exhibit @xmath31 closer to unity .",
    "figure 3b shows a reconstruction of the sun s mass loss history by taking eq .",
    "( [ eq : lxfit ] ) and simply assuming that @xmath35 for the range of @xmath31 estimates discussed above . also shown",
    "are hypothetical mass loss histories of the sun that were constructed by sackmann & boothroyd ( 2003 ) to solve the so - called `` faint young sun problem '' ( e.g. , sonett et al .",
    "1991 ) by positing a higher initial mass for the sun ( 1.011.07 @xmath36 ) .",
    "it is difficult to reconcile these mass loss histories with the ( substantially lower ) values computed from the above range of @xmath31 exponents .",
    "however , implicit in the @xmath37 scaling laws used above is the assumption that the strength of the young sun s subphotospheric convection is essentially independent of age and activity .",
    "the validity of this assumption remains to be seen .",
    "standard stellar evolution models do not include any substantial rotation dependence in their prescriptions for convection , but numerical simulations like those of brown et al .",
    "( 2007 ) are beginning to show that rapid rotation creates more intermittent or `` patchy '' convection with sites of substantially stronger turbulent motion than the present - day solar case .",
    "open magnetic field lines that feed the stellar wind are jostled by waves whose amplitudes scale directly with the peak convective velocity , and the mass loss rate depends on the deposition of this wave energy in the upper atmosphere ( e.g. , cranmer et al .",
    "considerable progress has been made over the last several decades in increasing our understanding of the physics of cool - star winds .",
    "much of this progress has come about because of cross - fertilization between the solar and stellar communities , as well as between theorists and observers .",
    "the diagnostic techniques described in   3 for obtaining mass loss rates continue to be developed and extended as the data accumulate and improve in quality .",
    "extrasolar planet studies are helping to accelerate this observational renaissance as well , since they are resulting in both a dramatic increase in data _ quantity _ and in new indirect probes of stellar wind acceleration regions .",
    "theoretical models of stellar atmospheres and winds are advancing rapidly .",
    "artificial features of past models , such as parameterized `` coronal heating functions '' and wave damping lengths , are now being replaced by more self - consistent and self - regulating physical processes ( e.g. , dmitruk et al .   2002 ; gudiksen 2005 ; suzuki 2006a , 2006b ; cranmer & van ballegooijen 2005 ; cranmer et al .",
    "2007 ) . in order for such models to be applied to a range of cool stars , though , both the subphotospheric convection dynamics and the magnetic field strength and geometry must be better constrained .",
    "these properties are difficult to observe directly , but the ongoing cross - pollination between the observational and theoretical communities continues to provide new insight .",
    "this work was supported by nasa under grant nng04ge77 g to the smithsonian astrophysical observatory .",
