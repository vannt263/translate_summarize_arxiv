    "while there is significant evidence for strong feedback from the central , supermassive black hole in this cluster ( see supplementary information ) , this figure shows that simple models of active galactic nuclei ( quasar type 1 and 2 , and seyfert type 1.8 shown in upper panel ) are unable to reproduce the spectral shape of the central galaxy in spt - clj2344 - 4243 . however , in the lower panel we show templates@xcite of four different dusty starbursts , or ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , which provide a much better match to the data .",
    "this good agreement suggests that the central galaxy in spt - clj2344 - 4243 , unlike typical central cluster galaxies , contains a dusty starburst and heavily obscured agn .",
    "specifically , the spectral shape is most similar to those of m82 , a dusty starburst with a strong wind , and iras 20551 - 4250 , which is a composite of a highly - obscured agn and a vigorous , dusty starburst . ]",
    "our data reduction pipeline was adapted from earlier work@xcite and includes the removal of flares , estimation of background from blank sky fields , and calibration using the latest set of corrections . from the cleaned image ,",
    "an x - ray spectrum was extracted over the energy range 0.58.0 kev within an annulus defined as 0.15r@xmath52 @xmath30 r @xmath30 r@xmath52 , excluding point sources , with the initial assumption that r@xmath52 = 1.0 mpc .",
    "we fit this spectrum using a combined wabs(mekal ) model , which accounts for galactic absorption in the emission spectrum of a hot , diffuse gas .",

    "from this plot , it is clear that the central @xmath710 kpc is dominated by a hard x - ray point source , likely an agn , and then the hardness ratio reaches a minimum over the range 10100 kpc , before settling to a roughly constant value from 1001300 kpc .",
    "this inner region with excess soft x - ray emission defines the cool core , with a cooling radius of @xmath7100 kpc .",
    "further , the right panel of figure [ sbprof ] shows that the classical cooling rate does not increase substantially by including emission from r @xmath32 100 kpc , suggesting that the cool core is confined to r @xmath30 100kpc .        based on scaling relations@xcite between the total spheroid stellar mass ( m@xmath57 , assuming the spheroid luminosity is equal to the total luminosity ) and black hole mass ( m@xmath58 )",

    "<S> the high star formation rates inferred from optical line emission and near  far - uv , optical , and mid  far ir continuum emission , combined with the strong signatures of x - ray cooling , suggest that the central galaxy in spt - clj2344 - 4243 may form a substantial fraction of its stars through an intense , short - lived cooling phase of the intracluster medium . such strong cooling </S>",
    "<S> can not be sustained for a significant amount of time , or both the central galaxy and its supermassive black hole would become too massive , and the central galaxy would have stellar populations considerably younger than those observed in giant elliptical galaxies today . </S>",
