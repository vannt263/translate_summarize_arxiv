    "given a graph @xmath0 and a natural number @xmath1 , there is a game called the _ c - coloring game _ of @xmath0 and it is known that there is a perfect deterministic strategy for this game if and only if @xmath0 has a c - coloring . thus , the _ chromatic number _ of @xmath0 , @xmath2 can be characterized as the least integer for which a perfect deterministic strategy exists for the c - coloring game .",
    "this led researchers to consider various kinds of probabilistic strategies for games , especially cases where the probabilities arose from the random outcomes of quantum experiments that were in finite dimensional entangled states , called _",
    "quantum strategies_. the least @xmath1 for which the c - coloring game has such a perfect strategy became known as the _ quantum chromatic _ number of a graph , denoted @xmath3 . for an introduction to this literature ,",
    "see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there are some open questions about the proper model for the set of probabilities that arise from entangled quantum experiments and this has led to the study of several , potentially different , definitions of quantum chromatic numbers denoted @xmath4 and @xmath5 , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , while there are many graphs @xmath0 for which @xmath6 , it is not yet known whether or not @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 can assume different values .",
    "furthermore , there are currently no general algorithms for computing these three quantum chromatic numbers .",
    "there is also an alternative characterization of @xmath2 in terms of graph homomorphisms . if @xmath10 denotes the complete graph on @xmath1 vertices , then @xmath2 is the least integer @xmath1 for which a graph homomorphism exists from @xmath0 to @xmath10 .",
    "again there is a corresponding _ graph homomorphism game _ and several , potentially different definitions of _ quantum graph homomorphisms _ defined in terms of the existence of perfect quantum strategies for the graph homomorphism game . in each case",
    ", the least c for which there exists a perfect quantum strategy for the graph homomorphism game from @xmath0 to @xmath10 is the corresponding quantum chromatic number . for more on this literature",
    "see , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "given graphs @xmath0 and @xmath11 , c. ortiz and the third author @xcite affiliated a * -algebra to this pair , denoted @xmath12 , and characterized the existence of graph homomorphisms from @xmath0 to @xmath11 in terms of representations of this algebra : @xcite proves that @xmath12 has a non - zero homomorphism into the complex numbers if and only if there exists a classical graph homomorphism from @xmath0 to @xmath11 . because the problem of determining if @xmath13 is an np - complete problem , the results of @xcite allow us to deduce that the problem of determining if @xmath14 has a non - trivial homomorphism into the complex numbers is an np - complete problem .",
    "similarly , @xcite also shows that there exists a _ quantum graph homomorphism _ , as defined by @xcite and @xcite , from @xmath0 to @xmath11 if and only if @xmath12 has a non - zero * -homomorphism into the matrices , that is , a non - zero finite dimensional representation .",
    "a result of @xcite shows that the problem of determining if @xmath15 is an np - hard problem .",
    "hence , the problem of determining if @xmath14 has any non - zero finite dimensional representations is np - hard .",
    "currently , the computational complexity of these other variations of the quantum chromatic number is unknown .",
    "the results of @xcite characterize the existence of these other types of quantum graph homomorphisms in terms of the existence of various types of traces on the algebra @xmath12 .",
    "thus , questions about the existence or non - existence of these various types of graph homomorphisms , and consequently quantum colorings , is reduced to questions about these algebras .",
    "this leads us to a more detailed study of these algebras , which is the main topic of this paper .",
    "since the existence of these various types of representations can be characterized in terms of whether or not certain ideals in these algebras are proper , we are naturally led to study new chromatic numbers of a graph determined by the least integer @xmath1 so that the type of ideal in which we are interested is proper . thus , whenever a certain type of ideal is proper , we can use that as the definition of a new type of graph homomorphism and obtain a new _ algebraic _ chromatic number of a graph , which we then try to relate to prior chromatic numbers .",
    "three of these new parameters are denoted @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "one goal of this paper is to study the properties of these new chromatic numbers .    in general",
    ", no algorithms are known for computing the quantum chromatic numbers of a graph .",
    "one advantage to @xmath16 is that its computation reduces to a grbner basis problem in a non - commutative algebra .",
    "however , using a machine - aided proof , we are able to show that @xmath19 for every graph , which is not the case for any of the earlier chromatic numbers .",
    "on the other hand , we know of no graphs that separate @xmath20 from the other quantum chromatic numbers , while computing this parameter can be done approximately with a combination of algebra and optimization ( semidefinite programming ) .    since all the earlier notions of quantum graph homomorphism and the corresponding quantum chromatic numbers , were defined in terms of the existence of _ perfect quantum strategies _ for certain games , we begin by identifying a certain family of games for which we can carry out the construction of @xcite and affiliate an algebra to the game such that the existence of various types of representations of the algebra determines whether or not various types of perfect quantum strategies exist for the game . for this family of games",
    "it is possible that all of the notions of perfect quantum strategies coincide and are equivalent to a certain _ hereditary _ ideal in this algebra being proper .      in section [ sec : def ]",
    ", we provide some background on games and strategies , introduce the family of _ synchronous games _ which are the games for which we can extend the results of @xcite and construct an algebra .    in section [ sec : alg - sync - game ]",
    ", we introduce the * -algebra of a synchronous game , the chromatic numbers @xmath16 and @xmath17 and prove some of their properties .",
    "in section [ sec:123colors ] , we focus on the case of 1 , 2 , and 3 colors .    in section [ sec : alg ] , we show that removing the assumption that the algebra be a free * -algebra instead of just a free algebra , changes nothing essential . we also show that it is enough to study these algebras over @xmath21 instead of @xmath22 .",
    "this allows us to use a grbner basis approach .    in section [ sec:4colors ]",
    ", we present the details of the machine - assisted proof that @xmath19 for all graphs .    in sections [ sec : loc ] and [ sec : loc properties ] , we introduce and study the _ locally commuting _ chromatic number @xmath18 .",
    "we lay out some definitions and a few basic properties of games and strategies .",
    "we will primarily be concerned with the @xmath1-coloring game and the graph homomorphism game .    by a * two - person finite input - output game *",
    "we mean a tuple @xmath23 where @xmath24 are finite sets and @xmath25 is a function that represents the rules of the game , sometimes called the predicate .",
    "the sets @xmath26 and @xmath27 represent the inputs that alice and bob can receive , and the sets @xmath28 and @xmath29 , represent the outputs that alice and bob can produce , respectively .",
    "a referee selects a pair @xmath30 , gives alice @xmath31 and bob @xmath32 , and they then produce outputs ( answers ) , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "they win the game if @xmath35 and lose otherwise .",
    "alice and bob are allowed to know the sets and the function @xmath36 and cooperate before the game to produce a strategy for providing outputs , but while producing outputs , alice and bob only know their own inputs and are not allowed to know the other person s input . each time that they are given an input and produce an output",
    "is referred to as a * round * of the game .",
    "we call such a game * synchronous * provided that : ( i ) alice and bob have the same input sets and the same output sets , which we denote by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively , and ( ii ) @xmath36 satisfies : @xmath39 that is , whenever alice and bob receive the same inputs then they must produce the same outputs . to simplify notation",
    "we write a synchronous game as @xmath40 .",
    "a _ graph _ @xmath0 is specified by a vertex set @xmath41 and an edge set @xmath42 , satisfying @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the * c - coloring game * for @xmath0 has inputs @xmath45 and outputs @xmath46 where the outputs are thought of as different colors .",
    "they win provided that whenever alice and bob receive adjacent vertices , i.e. , @xmath47 , their outputs are different colors and when they receive the same vertex they must output the same color .",
    "thus , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and the rule function is equal to 1 for all other tuples .",
    "it is easy to see that this is a synchronous game",
    ".    given two graphs @xmath0 and @xmath11 , a _ graph homomorphism from g to h _ is a function @xmath50 with the property that @xmath51 .",
    "the * graph homomorphism game * from @xmath0 to @xmath11 has inputs @xmath45 and outputs @xmath52 they win provided that whenever alice and bob receive inputs that are an edge in @xmath0 , then their outputs are an edge in @xmath11 and that whenever alice and bob receive the same vertex in @xmath0 they produce the same vertex in @xmath11 .",
    "this is also a synchronous game .",
    "a * deterministic strategy * for a game is a pair of functions , @xmath53 and @xmath54 such that if alice and bob receive inputs @xmath55 then they produce outputs @xmath56 .",
    "a deterministic strategy wins every round of the game if and only if @xmath57 such a strategy is called a * perfect deterministic strategy*.    it is not hard to see that for a synchronous game , any perfect deterministic strategy must satisfy , @xmath58 . in particular , a perfect deterministic strategy for the c - coloring game for @xmath0 is a function @xmath59 such that @xmath60 .",
    "thus , a perfect deterministic strategy is precisely a c - coloring of @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , a perfect deterministic strategy for the graph homomorphism is precisely a graph homomorphism .    finally , it is not difficult to see that if @xmath10 denotes the complete graph on @xmath1 vertices then a graph homomorphism exists from @xmath0 to @xmath10 if and only if @xmath0 has a c - coloring .",
    "this is because any time @xmath61 then a graph homomorphism must send them to distinct vertices in @xmath10 . indeed",
    ", the rule function for the c - coloring game is exactly the same as the rule function for the graph homomorphism game from @xmath0 to @xmath10 .    a * random strategy * for such a game is a conditional probability density @xmath62 , which represents the probability that , given inputs @xmath30 , alice and bob produce outputs @xmath63 .",
    "thus , @xmath64 and for each @xmath65 @xmath66    in this paper we identify random strategies with their conditional probability density , so that a random strategy will simply be a conditional probability density @xmath62 .",
    "a random strategy is called * perfect * if @xmath67 thus , for each round , a perfect strategy gives a winning output with probability 1 .",
    "we next discuss * local * random strategies , which are also sometimes called * classical * , meaning not quantum .",
    "they are obtained as follows : alice and bob share a probability space @xmath68 , for each input @xmath69 , alice has a random variable , @xmath70 and for each input @xmath71 , bob has a random variable , @xmath72 such that for each round of the game , alice and bob will evaluate their random variables at a point @xmath73 via a formula that has been agreed upon in advance .",
    "this yields conditional probabilities , @xmath74 this will be a perfect strategy if and only if @xmath75 or equivalently , @xmath76    if we have a perfect local strategy and set @xmath77 then @xmath78 since @xmath26 and @xmath27 are finite sets ; in particular , @xmath79 is non - empty . if we choose any @xmath80 and set @xmath81 and @xmath82 , then it is easily checked that this is a perfect deterministic strategy .",
    "thus , a perfect classical random strategy exists if and only if a perfect deterministic strategy exists .",
    "an advantage to using a perfect classical random strategy over a perfect deterministic strategy , is that it is difficult for an observer to find a deterministic strategy even after observing the outputs of many rounds .",
    "the idea behind * nonlocal games * is to allow a larger set of conditional probabilities , namely , those that can be obtained by allowing alice and bob to run quantum experiments to obtain their outputs .",
    "definitions of these various sets of probability densities , including loc , q , qa , qc , vect , nsb can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  6 ) or @xcite , so we will avoid repeating them here .",
    "we only remark that if for @xmath83 we use @xmath84 to denote the corresponding set of conditional probabilities , then it is known that @xmath85    the sets @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 represent three potentially different mathematical models for the set of all probabilities that can arise as outcomes from entangled quantum experiments .",
    "the question of whether or not @xmath89 for any number of experiments and any number of outputs is known to be equivalent to connes embedding conjecture due to results of @xcite .",
    "we say that @xmath62 is a * perfect t - strategy * for a game provided that it is a perfect strategy that belongs to the corresponding set of probability densities .",
    "given a graph @xmath0 we set @xmath90 equal to the least @xmath1 for which there exists a perfect t - strategy for the c - coloring game for @xmath0 .",
    "the above inclusions imply that @xmath91 currently , it is unknown if there are any graphs that separate @xmath92 and @xmath5 or whether these three parameters are always equal .",
    "examples of graphs are known for which @xmath93 , for which @xmath94 and for which @xmath95 . for details , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "other versions of quantum chromatic type graph parameters appear in @xcite and a comparison of those parameters with @xmath8 and @xmath96 can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1 ) .",
    "similarly , we say that there is a _",
    "t - homomorphism _ from @xmath0 to @xmath11 if and only if there exists a perfect t - strategy for the graph homomorphism game from @xmath0 to @xmath11 and it is unknown if q - homomorphisms , qa - homomorphisms and qc - homomorphisms are distinct or coincide .",
    "finally , we close this section by showing that it is enough to consider so - called symmetric games . note that in a synchronous game there is no requirement that @xmath97 .",
    "that is , the rule function does not need to be * symmetric * in this sense .",
    "the following shows that it is enough to consider synchronous games with this additional symmetry .",
    "given @xmath98 a synchronous game , we define @xmath99 by setting @xmath100 and set @xmath101",
    ". then it is easily seen that @xmath102 is a synchronous game with the property that @xmath103 .    in the remainder of this section , we prove the following slight extension of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath40 be a synchronous game and let @xmath104 be a perfect vect - strategy for @xmath105 , where the vectors @xmath106 and @xmath107 are as in the definition of a vector correlation(see @xcite )",
    ". then @xmath108 .",
    "by definition , for each @xmath109 the vectors @xmath110 are mutually orthogonal and @xmath111 are mutually orthogonal .",
    "so , @xmath112 thus , the inequalities are equalities , which forces @xmath113 for all @xmath109 and all @xmath114 .",
    "let @xmath115 be a synchronous game and let @xmath116 . if @xmath62 is a perfect t - strategy for @xmath105 , then @xmath117 for all @xmath118 and all @xmath119 .",
    "if @xmath62 is a perfect t - strategy , then it is a perfect vect - strategy and hence there exist vectors as in the definition such that , @xmath120 where the middle equality follows since the inner products are assumed to be non - negative .",
    "this corollary readily yields the following result .    [",
    "prop : reduce - to - synch - games ] let @xmath121 be a synchronous game and let @xmath122 . then @xmath62 is a perfect t - strategy for @xmath105 if and only if @xmath62 is a perfect t - strategy for @xmath102 .",
    "we begin by constructing a * -algebra , defined by generators and relations , that is affiliated with a synchronous game .",
    "the existence or non - existence of various types of perfect quantum strategies for the game then corresponds to the existence or non - existence of various types of representations of this algebra .",
    "this leads us to examine various ideals in the algebra .",
    "let @xmath123 be a synchronous game and assume that the cardinality of @xmath37 is @xmath124 while the cardinality of @xmath38 is @xmath125 .",
    "we will often identify @xmath37 with @xmath126 and @xmath38 with @xmath127 .",

    "we regard the group algebra as both a * -algebra , where for each group element @xmath132 we have @xmath133 , and as an ( incomplete ) inner product space , with the group elements forming an orthonormal set and the inner product is given by @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the trace functional .    for each @xmath109",

    "then @xmath147 , where the algebra on the right hand side is the algebra introduced in @xcite , so we shall continue that notation in this instance . recall that @xmath148 is then the algebra of the c - coloring game for @xmath0 .",
    "we say that a game has a perfect algebraic strategy if @xmath149 is nontrivial .",
    "given graphs g and h , we write @xmath150 if @xmath12 is nontirvial .",

    "[ thm : alc - functor ] the assignment @xmath583 @xmath584 is a functor , which is covariant in the first factor and contravariant in the second ; note that the category of graphs is with usual morphisms , not @xmath520-morphisms .",
    "if @xmath585 is a morphism , then we have a map @xmath586 given by @xmath587 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath588 is a morphism , then we have @xmath589 and so from the proof of lemma [ l : lc - comp ] , we have @xmath590 since @xmath591 is a morphism of graphs , we have a map @xmath592 as in the proof of lemma [ l : to->lc ] .",
    "composing with the above , we have @xmath593 .",
    "explicitly , this map is given by sending @xmath594 to @xmath595 .",
    "we now show how the functor @xmath553 interacts with various natural graph operations . to begin , recall that if @xmath0 is a graph , its suspension @xmath596 is defined by adding a new vertex @xmath31 and an edge from @xmath31 to each of the vertices of @xmath0 .",
    "given an algebra @xmath368 we shall let @xmath597 denote the algebra of @xmath1-tuples with entries from @xmath368 , i.e. , the tensor product @xmath598 where @xmath599 can be identfied with the algebra of @xmath22-valued functions on @xmath1 points .    [ prop : sigmag - h - lc ] let @xmath0 and @xmath11 be any graphs , and let @xmath600 be the non - isolated vertices .",
    "for @xmath601 we let @xmath602 denote the neighborhood of @xmath603 , i.e. , the induced subgraph of @xmath11 with vertices adjacent to @xmath603 ; notice @xmath604 unless @xmath603 has a self - edge .",
    "then @xmath605 in particular , if @xmath11 is vertex transitive and @xmath603 is any vertex of @xmath11 with neighborhood @xmath606 , then @xmath607    let @xmath608 be the new vertex added to @xmath596 , i.e. , @xmath609 . since @xmath608 is adjacent to every vertex of @xmath0 , we see @xmath610 commutes with @xmath611 for all @xmath612 and @xmath613 . furthermore , the defining relations of @xmath553 tell us @xmath614 where @xmath615 denotes the kronecker delta function .",
    "so , @xmath616/(\\sum_x e_{ux}-1,e_{ux}e_{uy}=\\delta_{x , y}e_{ux}).\\ ] ] in other words , the @xmath610 for @xmath617 are commuting orthogonal idempotents , which shows @xmath618 where the last equality comes from the fact that @xmath619 for @xmath564 .",
    "now note that @xmath620 remains non - zero in the quotient @xmath621 if and only if @xmath622 .",
    "thus , @xmath623 which establishes the first assertion of the proposition .",
    "the second assertion easily follows from the first since all neighborhoods are isomorphic .",
    "one easily checks that @xmath636 for any graph @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , our desired statement holds for @xmath536 .",
    "the proof then follows from induction on @xmath129 by applying corollary [ cor : sigmag - lc ] and using that @xmath637 .    in theorem [ thm : chi_lc(k_n ) ]",
    ", we proved @xmath497 .",
    "corollary [ cor : lc - kc ] gives another proof of this result which is more refined : the corollary tells us the specific structure of @xmath638 whereas the theorem merely tells us it is non - zero .",
    "[ cor : lc - out - of - k_n ] if @xmath11 is a graph , then @xmath639 and for @xmath640 , we have @xmath641 where @xmath642 is an @xmath643-clique and @xmath644 . in particular , if @xmath11 is vertex transitive on @xmath1 vertices , then @xmath645 where @xmath642 is any @xmath643-clique in @xmath11 .",
    "we show by induction that the @xmath649 form an @xmath650-clique and that @xmath651 . for @xmath652",
    "this is just the definition . for @xmath653 ,",
    "observe that by construction @xmath654 and since @xmath655 forms an @xmath656-clique , we see @xmath649 forms an @xmath650-clique .",
    "next , @xmath657 is the set of @xmath658 that are adjacent to @xmath659 , which is the definition of @xmath660 .",
    "this shows @xmath661 and by the @xmath536 case , each summand is isomorphic to @xmath662 copies of @xmath663 .",
    "now notice that @xmath664 is independent of the order of the sequence , and hence this term arises @xmath665 times .",
    "this yields the desired statement .",
    "we next consider how @xmath553 interacts with the categorical product @xmath668 .",
    "recall that if @xmath11 and @xmath669 are graphs then @xmath670 is a graph with vertex set @xmath671 and where @xmath672 if and only if @xmath673 and @xmath674 .",
    "[ rmk : preserve - prod ] as shown in theorem [ thm : alc - functor ] , we can view @xmath553 as a functor .",
    "theorem [ thm : preserve - prod ] can be interpreted as saying that the second factor of the functor @xmath676 preserves products . recall that since the second factor is contravariant , preserving products means that it takes products in graphs to coproducts in @xmath677-algebras , namely tensor products .",
    "since we have a map @xmath678 , theorem [ thm : alc - functor ] tells us that we have a map @xmath679 .",
    "similarly for @xmath669 , and hence a natural map @xmath680 . explicitly , it is given by @xmath681 we now construct an inverse map given by @xmath682 @xmath683 provided this is well - defined , it is indeed an inverse since @xmath684 where the last equality uses the fact that @xmath685 unless @xmath686 . also , composing the two maps in the opposite order yields the identity since @xmath687    the rest of the proof is devoted to showing that the map we constructed above is well - defined .",
    "first note that @xmath688 next , @xmath689 if @xmath690 then without loss of generality @xmath433 .",
    "so , @xmath691 next assume @xmath692 .",
    "we need to check that the image of @xmath693 is equal to that @xmath694 . @xmath695 and since @xmath692 , this is equal to @xmath696 which is the image of @xmath694 .",
    "finally , we must show that if @xmath692 and @xmath697 then @xmath693 maps to 0 . since @xmath697 , without loss of generality @xmath698 .",
    "then the image of @xmath693 is @xmath699 since @xmath700 .",
    "recall that the exponential of graphs @xmath702 is defined as follows : its vertex set consists of all functions @xmath703 and there is an edge @xmath704 if for all @xmath673 we have @xmath705 .",
    "note that if @xmath706 is a graph homomorphism , then it has a self - edge .",
    "[ prob : adjunction - exp ] if one allows @xmath11 to have self edges , then @xmath495 can be defined using the same relations at the beginning of this section .",
    "one can then define a map @xmath708 given by @xmath709 is this map an isomorphism ?",
    "in other words , are products and exponentials adjoints ?",
    "in addition to the categorical product @xmath668 , there are several other kinds of products on graphs , which we now consider . both @xmath710 and @xmath711",
    "have vertex set @xmath712 . in the former ,",

    "the products @xmath715 and @xmath716 are referred to as the cartesian and strong products , respectively .",
    "we have at least @xmath719 maps @xmath720 , so lemma [ l : to->lc ] and corollary [ cor : chi_lc - under - maps ] show @xmath721 .",
    "similarly for @xmath11 and so @xmath722 . to prove the result , it now suffices to show we have a map @xmath723 indeed , if @xmath724 and @xmath725 are non - zero , then so is @xmath726 since the above map would send 0 to 0 and 1 to 1 , and if @xmath727 in @xmath726 , then @xmath727 in @xmath728 , which is not the case .",
    "taking @xmath729 , this would then show @xmath730 .",
    "we now construct the above map .",
    "we define it by : @xmath731 and show it is well - defined .",

    "it suffices to construct a map @xmath758 we define it by @xmath759 one readily checks that this map is well - defined .",
