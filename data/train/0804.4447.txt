    "classical cellular automata have become a standard modeling tool for complex phenomena . with their discrete time step and their intrinsically high degree of parallelization",
    "they are ideally suited for models of diverse phenomena as coffee percolation , highway traffic and oil extraction from porous media . as an abstract computational model cellular automata can simulate turing machines , and even explicit simple automata such as conway s life game",
    "have been shown to support universal computation @xcite .",
    "on the quantum side , the interest in cellular automata stems from their implementation in optical lattices and arrays of optical microtraps . however , the theory of quantum cellular automata ( qcas ) is still in its early stage .",
    "since each cell may influence several others , the dynamics is subject to a `` no - cloning '' constraint , leading to a non - trivial interplay between the conditions of locality and unitarity .",
    "it is therefore helpful to have some class of qcas , which can be analyzed in great detail , and which can serve as a testing ground for general ideas about qcas .",
    "this paper is concerned with such an analysis , namely of the special class of clifford quantum cellular automata ( cqcas ) , in which the elementary time step is given by a `` clifford gate '' , meaning that it takes tensor products of pauli matrices to tensor products of other pauli matrices . in the theory of gate model computation , and for the one - way quantum computation model ,",
    "a detailed analysis of what can be done with clifford operations alone turned out to be very useful , even though  as the downside of allowing an efficient classical description ",
    "such gates alone do not allow universal quantum computation .",
    "by analogy it is therefore clear that cqcas do not comprise the full complexity of qcas . what one can hope to get",
    ", however , is an interesting class of cellular automata , and some tools for understanding this class in great detail .",
    "a similar analysis has been done with gaussian quantum cellular automata  @xcite , e.g. the qca describes a chain of harmonic oscillators with nearest neighbor couplings .",
    "for all these qcas the hilbert space of one elementary cell is infinite dimensional , and the qca maps phase space translations , also referred to as weyl operators , to phase space translations . in our approach",
    "we use elementary cells with a finite number of levels , which corresponds to replacing the continuous phase space by a discrete space .      by definition ,",
    "a cellular automaton is a lattice system , which consists of many subsystems ( called `` cells '' ) labeled by a point lattice in space .",
    "for simplicity , we will always take the lattice as @xmath2 , the integer cubic lattice in @xmath3 space dimensions , where we discuss periodic boundary conditions , and hence toroidal lattices ] .",
    "the cell systems in the classical case may have states like `` occupied '' and `` empty '' .",
    "in the quantum case , they will be @xmath4-state quantum systems , for some finite @xmath4 . in either case",
    "the group of lattice translations ( `` shifts '' ) is a symmetry of the system .",
    "the dynamics will be given by a discrete global time step , or global `` transition rule '' assumed to have the following three properties :    * _ translation invariance _ : the time step commutes with the lattice translation symmetries . *",
    "_ reversibility _ : there is an inverse rule . for a finite quantum system",
    "this would mean unitary dynamics .",
    "for the infinite lattice system this will be stated algebraically below . * _ locality _ , or `` finite propagation speed '' : the state of each cell after one step can be computed from the state in a fixed finite region around the cell .",
    "these assumption define the class of reversible qcas @xcite .",
    "the locality and reversibility conditions are best phrased in the heisenberg picture : if @xmath5 denotes some observable of the system , its expectation after one time step starting from the initial state @xmath6 will be @xmath7 for a suitable observable @xmath8 , where by @xmath9 we denote the expectation of @xmath5 in the state @xmath6 . the transformation @xmath10 is what we will call the _ global rule _ of the automaton .",
    "then reversibility ( together with complete positivity , which is required of any dynamical map ) implies that @xmath11 is a homomorphism of the observable algebra of the whole system : @xmath11 is linear , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "locality means that an observable @xmath14 localized at some lattice point @xmath15 ( i.e. , an observable of the cell at @xmath16 ) will be mapped to an observable localized in the region @xmath17 . that is , @xmath18 will be in the tensor product of the cell algebras belonging to the sites @xmath19 with @xmath20 . by translation invariance",
    "this set @xmath21 , called the _ neighborhood scheme _ of the automaton is independent of @xmath16 .",
    "the global transition rule @xmath11 is a map on an infinite dimensional space , and hence not readily specified explicitly .",
    "however , by using the basic properties of qcas one can see that it suffices to know just a few local data , associated with the region @xmath21 , in order to reconstruct @xmath11 uniquely .",
    "suppose we know @xmath18 for every observable @xmath14 in some basic cell @xmath16 . then by translation invariance",
    "we know the analogous transformation for _ any _ cell .",
    "moreover , since every local observable can expanded in products of one - cell observables , and because @xmath11 is a homomorphism , we can compute @xmath11 for any local observable .",
    "so the restriction @xmath22 of @xmath11 to the observables of a single cell @xmath16 can be called the _ local rule _ of the automaton .",
    "we can also decide by a finite set of equations , whether a proposed local rule actually belongs to a well - defined global rule : clearly @xmath22 must be a homomorphism .",
    "the only further condition one has to check is that the images of observables @xmath14 and @xmath23 localized in the cells indicated also commute , i.e. , @xmath24 , whenever @xmath25 .",
    "this is necessary , because @xmath14 and @xmath23 commute , and a moment s reflection shows that this is also sufficient for uniquely reconstructing the images of arbitrary observables under @xmath11 .",
    "the commutation conditions on the local rule are trivially satisfied when @xmath16 and @xmath26 are sufficiently far apart , when @xmath17 and @xmath27 are disjoint .",
    "hence only finitely many conditions need to be checked .    for special classes ,",
    "the job of specifying a qca via its local rule can be reduced still further , which is where the clifford condition comes in .",
    "let us assume now that we have a qubit system , so the local cell dimension is @xmath28 .",
    "for each local cell we thus have a basis for the observables , consisting of the identity and the three pauli matrices , which we denote by @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "by @xmath31 etc .  we denote the corresponding pauli matrix belonging to the cell @xmath16 .",
    "finite tensor products of pauli matrices belonging to different sites , perhaps with a sign @xmath32 will be referred to as _",
    "pauli products_. these form a group , called the pauli group . then a _",
    "clifford quantum cellular automaton _",
    "( cqca for short ) is defined by the condition    * _ clifford condition _ :",
    "if @xmath5 is any multiple of a pauli product , so is @xmath8 .",
    "clearly , this is equivalent to the property that one - cell pauli operators are taken to pauli products , which simplifies the local rule .",
    "moreover , it suffices to specify @xmath33 and @xmath34 for some @xmath16 , because we can compute @xmath35 via the homomorphism property .",
    "hence a cqca is defined in terms of just two pauli products .",
    "[ example-0 ] for the one - dimensional lattice ( @xmath36 ) , consider the relations @xmath37 let us verify that all requirements for a local rule are satisfied . to begin with each of the expressions on the right hand side , as a product of pauli matrices , is hermitian with square one .",
    "these are all the required conditions related to just a single line , and are satisfied for any pauli product with a sign @xmath38 .",
    "next we have to verify the anti - commutation relation arising from applying a homomorphism @xmath11 to the anti - commutation relation @xmath39 . indeed , @xmath40 .",
    "hence the definition @xmath41 again produces a hermitian operator with square @xmath42 , and the local rule is a homomorphism @xmath22 into the algebra on the sites @xmath17 with @xmath43 .",
    "finally , we have to check the commutation rules for the images of observables from neighboring sites .",
    "for example , we have @xmath44=-[z_x , z_x\\otimes x_{x+1}\\otimes z_{x+2}]=0 $ ] , and similarly @xmath45=0 $ ] .",
    "perhaps the only non - trivial relation to check is @xmath46    = [ z_{x-1}\\otimes x_x\\otimes z_{x+1},z_{x}\\otimes x_{x+1}\\otimes z_{x+2 } ]    = 0,\\ ] ] which holds because the factors on sites @xmath16 and @xmath47 both _ anti-_commute .    in principle",
    ", we would also have to check the existence of an inverse for the automaton , which is actually given by @xmath48 and @xmath49 , but as was shown in @xcite , this already follows from the homomorphism property .",
    "it is clear from this example that the search for cqcas is now a combinatorial problem .",
    "we can first look for _ self commuting _ pauli products , i.e. , pauli products , which commute with all translates of itself .",
    "only these can appear on the right hand side of local rules .",
    "one can then check , for any pair @xmath50 of such products , whether they anti - commute , while all proper translates of @xmath51 commute with @xmath52 .",
    "in fact , we began our investigation by running this simple search program .",
    "we found , for example , that while there is a rich variety of self - commuting pauli products only reflection symmetric products could appear in a local rule .",
    "this will indeed be shown in full generality below .",
    "commuting sets of pauli products also play a central role in the problem of determining so - called stabilizer states : these are pure states , which can be characterized by eigenvalue equations for pauli products or , equivalently , by the condition that certain pauli products have expectation @xmath38 .",
    "it is easy to check that pauli products which simultaneously have sharp expectations @xmath38 must commute .",
    "now for the infinite lattice systems it is natural to ask which pauli products @xmath5 have the property that there is a unique pure state @xmath6 of the infinite system , which has expectation 1 for @xmath5 and all its translates .    as the simplest example , let us take @xmath53 , so we ask for states with @xmath54 for all @xmath15 .",
    "clearly , this defines the `` all spins up '' state , which is an infinite product state . a slightly more complex example uses the stabilizer operators @xmath55 , which singles out the one - dimensional _ cluster state _",
    ", whose higher dimensional analogs are used as the entanglement resource for universal one - way quantum computing  @xcite .",
    "showing that these eigenvalue equations define a unique state of the infinite lattice is now very easy , by using the cellular automaton ( [ example - rule ] ) : since this automaton maps @xmath56 to the required stabilizer operator , all existence and uniqueness problems for such a state are mapped to the corresponding trivial questions for the stabilizer operator @xmath56 .",
    "in other words , self - commuting pauli products of the form @xmath57 for some cqca @xmath11 characterize a unique translation invariant cluster state .",
    "we will show later that ( at least in one dimension ) the converse is also true , so that there is a very close connection between stabilizer states and clifford cellular automata .",
    "the definition of cqcas given above applies only to qubit systems .",
    "however , all our results are also valid for higher dimensional cells , particular cells of prime dimension @xmath4 .",
    "the role of the pauli operators @xmath58 and @xmath30 is then taken by the cyclic shift on @xmath59 , and the multiplication by a phase , i.e. @xmath60 where all ket labels @xmath61 are taken modulo @xmath4",
    ". products of these operators are called _ weyl operators _ , and the appropriate definition of cqcas requires that @xmath33 and @xmath34 are both tensor products of weyl operators .",
    "the necessary preliminaries on the pauli group and clifford operations in this extended setting , and the background concerning infinite lattice systems are provided in subsection  [ sec-2 - 1 ] .    in order to utilize the translation symmetry one would like to use fourier transform techniques .",
    "however , in the discrete structures an integral with complex phases makes no sense .",
    "it turns out , however , that a `` generating function '' technique does nearly as well .",
    "the analogue of the fourier transform is then a laurent - polynomial in an indeterminate variable , i.e. , a polynomial with coefficients in the field @xmath62 with both positive and negative powers .",
    "the salient facts about this structure will be provided in subsection  [ sec-2 - 3 ] .",
    "the description in terms of laurent polynomials can also be adapted to lattices with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this will be described in section  [ sec - periodic ] .      in order to discuss general clifford quantum cellular automata ,",
    "that is , for arbitrary lattice and single cell dimension , we introduce in section  [ sec-2 ] the necessary mathematical tools .",
    "we first review the concept of discrete weyl systems and ( infinite ) tensor products of them , thereby characterizing the underlying `` phase space '' .",
    "we show that clifford qcas can be completely characterized in terms of classical symplectic cellular automata .",
    "we also introduce our fourier transform techniques and study the structure of isotropic subspaces , because these play an essential role for the characterization of symplectic cellular automata and translationally invariant stabilizer states .    in section  [ sec-3 ] we will state our main results .",
    "we show that symplectic cellular automata can be identified with two - by - two matrices , which have laurent - polynomials as matrix elements .",
    "we will find that the determinant of this matrix must be one and that the polynomials must be reflection invariant .",
    "in the one - dimensional case we state that every translationally invariant stabilizer state can be prepared out of a product state by a single cqca step . furthermore , we also specify the generators of all 1d qcas .",
    "finally , we show in section  [ sec - periodic ] that the close connection between translationally invariant stabilizer states and cqcas also holds in the case of periodic boundary conditions even in every lattice dimension .",
    "we introduce some mathematical tools , which we will use to study clifford qcas .",
    "we start with a short repetition of finite weyl systems , which generalize the pauli operators to systems with prime number dimensions .",
    "these weyl operators can be described by phase space vectors and clifford operations are induced by symplectic transformations on the phase space .",
    "since we are looking for translationally invariant operations , we also introduce some kind of fourier transform .      each single cell in a qca",
    "is given by a finite dimensional quantum system , so the observables on a single system can be described by matrices from the algebra @xmath63 .",
    "a possible basis for this algebra is given by weyl operators @xmath64 , whereby @xmath58 and @xmath30 are given by the generalized pauli operators from equation  ( [ onestep ] ) .",
    "these operators fulfill the weyl relations @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the @xmath67 root of unity .",
    "> from this equation the commutation relation @xmath68 immediately follows .",
    "obviously we get for @xmath28 the standard pauli operators from @xmath69 and the weyl operators are generalizations of the pauli operators to higher dimensional spaces .",
    "the indices @xmath70 and @xmath71 are integers modulo @xmath4 , so they are elements of the finite field @xmath72 . in infinite dimensional systems",
    "weyl operators describe phase space translations and therefore we call the space @xmath73 a discrete phase space .    building a tensor product of weyl operators",
    "means that we must assign a phase space vector @xmath74 to each lattice point @xmath75 , so @xmath76 is a mapping from @xmath2 into @xmath73 and we denote for the tensor product @xmath77 this infinite tensor product is well defined , if there are only finitely many of the weyl operators different from @xmath78 . for a mapping @xmath79",
    "we have that only finitely many @xmath16 with @xmath80 are allowed , so the support of @xmath76 is finite .",
    "the set of such functions describes the global system and is identified with the global phasespace @xmath81 .",
    "we denote the finitely supported functions from @xmath2 to @xmath82 by @xmath83 and we have @xmath84 .",
    "the corresponding weyl operators generate an algebra and , by restricting the support of the functions to some finite subset @xmath85 , we get a finite dimensional algebra @xmath86 , also called the local algebra of @xmath87 . by taking the union of these algebras over all finite subsets of @xmath2 and taking the closure ( in operator norm )",
    "we get a quasilocal @xmath88-algebra @xmath89  @xcite , which is used in the general theory of quantum cellular automata  @xcite .",
    "the local structure is accompanied by the symmetry group of lattice translations . for each lattice translation",
    "@xmath75 an automorphism @xmath90 is defined by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the translation of phase space vectors . given a phase space vector @xmath76 ,",
    "the translated vector is @xmath93 .",
    "so the automorphism @xmath90 shifts the position of each tensor factor by @xmath16 .",
    "it follows directly from ( [ translation ] ) that the homomorphism property @xmath94 holds .",
    "furthermore , the automorphism @xmath90 maps the local algebra @xmath95 onto @xmath96 .",
    "the weyl relations of a single system completely determine the relations of the global system which are given by @xmath97 where we have introduced the bilinear form @xmath98 .",
    "the adjoint of a weyl operator is given by @xmath99 which is due to the unitarity of the weyl operators .",
    "since commutation relations are essential for validating possible local rules of quantum cellular automata , the commutation relations of weyl operators are most important for us .",
    "we get @xmath100 whereby @xmath101 is the canonical symplectic form on @xmath81 .",
    "this means that two weyl operators @xmath102 and @xmath103 are commuting if and only if @xmath104 ( and for @xmath28 they anti - commute if @xmath105 ) .",
    "in particular , an abelian algebra of weyl operators is given by a subspace of @xmath81 on which the symplectic form vanishes .",
    "such a subspace is called isotropic and a maximally abelian algebra corresponds to a maximally isotropic subspace .      as already mentioned",
    "a clifford quantum cellular automaton is a qca which maps weyl operators to multiples of weyl operators , which are in our case tensor products of single cell weyl operators , so we have the relation ( the `` clifford condition '' ) @xmath106 with a mapping @xmath107 on the phase space @xmath81 and some phase valued function @xmath108 . since @xmath11 is an automorphism we find with equation  ( [ com - ccr ] ) that @xmath109 holds , so we have @xmath110 or in other words",
    "@xmath107 is a symplectic transformation .    for reversible operations",
    "the clifford condition is in general equivalent to the weyl covariance ( for general theory on covariant channels we refer to @xcite and for the special case of weyl covariance to @xcite ) of the quantum channel :    an automorphism @xmath11 on the weyl algebra @xmath89 fulfills the clifford condition  ( [ cqca ] ) if and only if the weyl covariance @xmath111 holds for all operators @xmath112 and some symplectic transformation @xmath107 .    because the weyl operators form a basis of @xmath89 we just have to insert @xmath102 for some @xmath113 in the covariance condition , which yields the equation @xmath114 .",
    "if @xmath11 is a clifford automorphism we have already seen that @xmath107 is a symplectic transformation and obviously fulfills this equation . in the inverse direction",
    "we get that @xmath115 must be a multiple of @xmath116 , because the relation must hold for all @xmath117 and the symplectic form is non degenerate ( note that the support of the phase space vectors is finite and that @xmath107 maps therefore finitely supported vectors to finitely supported vectors , so the commutation relations can be checked in a finite dimensional space ) .",
    "since a qca is a translationally invariant automorphism on the quasilocal algebra , it suffices that the clifford condition holds for the local rule , e.g. the qca restricted to operators which are localized in a single cell .",
    "furthermore , because of the weyl relations on a single cell , we only need to specify the image of the weyl operators @xmath118 and @xmath119 . to some extend",
    "we are free in the choice of the phases @xmath120 , since these phases do not interfere with the commutation relations for the local rule .",
    "the only condition is that some power of a weyl operator is always equal to @xmath42 ( we will specify this below ) , and so these phases must be some roots of unity .",
    "the two phases @xmath121 and @xmath122 completely determine the function @xmath123 .    of course @xmath107 and @xmath123 must be translationally invariant , because @xmath11 is translationally invariant . using the homomorphism property of the qca and equation  ( [ ccr ] )",
    "we get @xmath124 , so  because the weyl operators form a basis  the transformation @xmath107 must be linear and the phase function must fulfill @xmath125 which enables us to calculate the phase @xmath126 for each @xmath113 , if the local rule and therefore @xmath107 and the phases @xmath121 and @xmath122 are given . in total we get the following theorem :    [ thm-1 ]",
    "if @xmath11 is a clifford quantum cellular automaton ( equation ( [ cqca ] ) ) on the weyl algebra @xmath89 , then @xmath107 is a translationally invariant linear symplectic transformation ( `` symplectic cellular automaton '' ) and the phase function @xmath123 fulfills equation  ( [ coboundary ] ) .",
    "this means that we are able to study clifford qcas  up to some phase function  in terms of a classical cellular automaton on the phase space @xmath81 .",
    "it is well known that clifford operations allow an efficient classical description , which in the case of qcas turned out to be the group of classical symplectic cellular automata . in the rest of the paper we will study the structure of this kind of cellular automata , thereby characterizing the structure of cqcas .",
    "we would like to give a closed expression for the phase function @xmath123 , but this has to be done in dependence of the cell dimension .",
    "first we consider the case @xmath127 .",
    "then all weyl operators fulfill @xmath128 and because of @xmath129 the phase @xmath126 must be a @xmath67 root of unity .",
    "so we can write @xmath130 with a function @xmath131 , which then has to fulfill @xmath132 .",
    "this equation determines the function @xmath133 up to some linear functional @xmath134 , which is given by the choice of the phases @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the bilinear form @xmath137 is symmetric , because @xmath107 is a symplectic transformation .",
    "if @xmath127 we may divide by @xmath138 and the general solution is @xmath139 .",
    "the case of qubits ( @xmath28 ) is slightly more complicated because the weyl operators fulfill @xmath140 .",
    "so the phase function must fulfill @xmath141 with @xmath142 .",
    "we replace the form @xmath143 by the bilinear form @xmath144 , which is formally given by @xmath145 , so the values of @xmath146 are even elements of @xmath147 and the weyl relation becomes @xmath148 .",
    "this means that @xmath149 fulfills @xmath150 with the form @xmath151 .",
    "this form is symmetric , so in the decomposition @xmath152 we have @xmath153 and all these elements are even .",
    "we can find @xmath154 with @xmath155 , but this choice is not unique in @xmath147 and corresponds exactly to the freedom in the choice of the phases @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the solution for @xmath149 is then given by @xmath156 ( note that @xmath157 and so @xmath158 holds ) .",
    "we would like to use fourier transform techniques for the study of the structural properties of symplectic ca , because of translational invariance , and because we know that this is very helpful for symplectic ca with continuous single cell phase space  @xcite .",
    "so we have to apply a fourier transform to the functions @xmath83 .",
    "but the values of these functions are in the finite field @xmath82 and multiplying such a value with a complex number does not really match .",
    "it turns out that a slight modification of the usual fourier transform does as well . for a function @xmath159",
    "we define @xmath160 with @xmath161 . now",
    "the transformed function @xmath162 is a polynomial or , more precisely , a laurent - polynomial in the variables @xmath163 with coefficients in @xmath82 , which will be denoted by @xmath164 .",
    "note that we have indeed polynomials , because the functions in @xmath83 are finitely supported .",
    "equation  ( [ fourier ] ) identifies functions of @xmath83 with polynomials @xmath165 and this identification is unique , so @xmath83 and @xmath165 are isomorphic .",
    "the usual fourier transform would require @xmath166 .",
    "we do not further specify the domain of the variables , and this approach can be seen as `` generating function approach '' or `` algebraic fourier transform '' .",
    "the convolution @xmath167 is a natural product becomes a `` commutative division ring '' .",
    "] of functions in @xmath83 .",
    "the invertible elements with respect to this operation are the functions which are supported on a single lattice point , e.g. @xmath168 ( @xmath169 is the kronecker - delta ) with @xmath170 and @xmath75 , and the unit element is @xmath171 .",
    "the nice fact about fourier transform is that the convolution turns into a usual product which is also true for our algebraic version : @xmath172 note that the invertible polynomials are monomials , e.g. they are of the form @xmath173 .",
    "of course the unit element is the constant @xmath174 .",
    "another important operation is the reflection operation ( or involution ) @xmath175 for @xmath159 .",
    "obviously the reflection preserves the convolution , e.g. @xmath176 , and for the transformed function we have @xmath177 .",
    "the phase space @xmath81 consists of two - dimensional tuples of functions from @xmath83 and all operations can be defined component - wise - module .",
    "] , so we get that the phase space is isomorphic to @xmath178",
    ". we would like to study the structure of symplectic ca in this polynomial space .",
    "the transformation of an operation @xmath179 is defined according to @xmath180 , so @xmath181 is a mapping from @xmath182 to @xmath182 .",
    "we introduce the symplectic form @xmath183 by @xmath184 which can be written as @xmath185 , whereby @xmath186 denotes the @xmath187-matrix @xmath188 with polynomial entries .",
    "the symplectic form @xmath189 is the best fitting symplectic form for symplectic ca , because it combines both the basic symplectic form @xmath190 as well as the translation invariance :    [ sca - fourier ] a linear operation @xmath107 on the phase space @xmath81 is a symplectic cellular automaton , if and only if , the transformed operation @xmath181 leaves the symplectic form @xmath189 invariant .    for this proof",
    "we introduce the form @xmath191 for @xmath192 .",
    "a straightforward computation shows that @xmath193 holds .",
    "this means we have @xmath194 , so @xmath189 is the fourier transform of @xmath195 and the invariance of @xmath195 under some operation @xmath107 is equivalent to the invariance of @xmath189 under @xmath181 .",
    "now suppose @xmath107 is a symplectic ca .",
    "then we have for all @xmath75 that @xmath196 holds , because @xmath107 is translationally invariant and preserves @xmath190 , so @xmath195 is invariant under @xmath107 .",
    "if @xmath107 leaves @xmath195 invariant , this holds also for @xmath197 , and because of this @xmath198 holds for all @xmath75 and all @xmath192 and so @xmath107 must commute with the translations @xmath92 .",
    "so we can characterize symplectic ca in `` momentum space '' by studying the linear transformations on @xmath182 which leave the symplectic form @xmath189 invariant .",
    "in the subsequent we will mainly work in the polynomial space @xmath165 .",

    "we are going to present another example to show that the phase space vectors do not have to be reflection invariant , because not all invertible elements are monomials .",

    "so @xmath76 is indeed a valid column of a symplectic automaton , but starting from the `` all spins up '' state both cqcas corresponding to @xmath492 prepare the same stabilizer state .",
    "we have analyzed the structure of clifford quantum cellular automata that act on a @xmath3-dimensional lattice of @xmath4-level systems .",

    "this phase space can be identified with two - dimensional vectors of laurent - polynomials , and symplectic cellular automata can be described by two - by - two matrices with laurent - polynomial entries .",
    "we have shown that these entries must be reflection invariant and that up to some global shift the determinant of the matrix must be one , so the group of cqcas is isomorphic to the special linear group of two - by - two matrices with reflection invariant polynomials as matrix elements .",
    "we have proven that there is a correspondence between 1d cqcas and 1d translationally invariant stabilizer states . for a fixed translationally invariant pure stabilizer state @xmath493 , which is in particular a product state ,",
    "every other translationally invariant pure stabilizer state @xmath149 can be created by applying an appropriate cqca @xmath494 to the chosen product state : @xmath495 .",
    "pure stabilizer states can be also characterized by maximally isotropic subspaces .",
    "we have characterized the phase space vectors , which generate maximally isotropic subspaces , namely their components must be coprime and reflection invariant .    in the one - dimensional case",
    "we have also more clarified the group structure of cqcas .",
    "as we have shown , each one - dimensional cqca can be decomposed into a product of elementary shear automata and local fourier transforms , so the group of cqcas is generated by this set of operations .    for periodic boundary conditions the techniques from infinitely extended lattices",
    "can be applied to a certain extend . according to the discussion of translationally invariant stabilizer states on the 1d lattice",
