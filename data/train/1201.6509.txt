    "the koszul duality theory originates from the work of s. priddy @xcite , inspired by ideas of koszul @xcite .",
    "priddy s theory describes `` small '' resolutions for associative algebras . to compute derived functors , like the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 functors",
    ", one needs projective resolutions of modules .",
    "there always exist such resolutions , which are built functorially from the bar construction , for instance .",
    "this functoriality has a price : such a resolution is pretty big . for a given algebra",
    ", one can find a ( generally ) smaller resolution by describing step by step an economic set of generators , called the syzygies .",
    "this inductive process is now called the koszul  tate resolution after @xcite .",
    "the same type of process allows one to build a model for a given algebra  @xmath3 , that is a differential graded free algebra whose homology is isomorphic to  @xmath3 .",
    "such a model , according to the general results of homotopical algebra  @xcite , can be used to compute the quillen homology @xmath4 , for instance .    the original koszul duality theory developed by priddy starts from an algebra  @xmath3 given with a quadratic presentation @xmath5 and produces a quadratic koszul dual coalgebra  @xmath6 generated by the same presentation . under this algebraic structure ,",
    "it produces , at once , a good candidate for the space of syzygies .",
    "all the three graded vector spaces @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath4 can be expressed naturally in terms of  @xmath6 by re - grading or passing to the graded dual @xmath9 . the algebra @xmath10 admits a simple presentation as @xmath11 .",
    "the relationship between the differentials in the corresponding resolutions is more subtle .",
    "the higher case , when a given algebra  @xmath3 has a homogeneous presentation @xmath12 of weight  @xmath13 , has been first studied by r. berger in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where a candidate for the dual @xmath10 of the space of syzygies was described , and where a condition for that candidate to work was given .",
    "each of the equivalent ways to look at the space of syzygies ( @xmath2 , @xmath1 , quillen homology ) exhibits a rich structure of an associative algebra up to homotopy , or @xmath14-algebra .",
    "this viewpoint has become more common in ring theory in the past decade , once it was understood that higher operations on the @xmath2-algebras of associative algebras allow one to keep track of all the homotopy information of those algebras that would otherwise be lost if we restrict ourselves to the yoneda product only .",
    "this circle of ideas is presented in a sequence of papers of lu , palmieri , wu , and zhang @xcite .    in the case of @xmath0-koszul algebras , the @xmath14-algebra structure of the yoneda algebras",
    "was computed by he and lu in  @xcite .",
    "they proved that most of the higher operations for such an algebra vanish , and that the non - vanishing ones admit very explicit formulas . in a sense ,",
    "their theorems provide an exhaustive description of the @xmath2-algebras as @xmath14-algebras . however , those theorems have a slightly mysterious feature which makes one hope for a different way to view the same result .",
    "namely , in the quadratic case the @xmath2-algebra of a koszul algebra is an @xmath14-algebra with all the higher operations vanishing , that is an associative algebra , presented by generators and relations . in the @xmath0-koszul case",
    ", the @xmath2-algebra carries an @xmath14-algebra structure with all the higher operations except for the @xmath0th one vanishing , that is , an @xmath15-algebra .",
    "it is also proved to be a reduced @xmath15-algebra , meaning that it satisfies additional vanishing conditions .",
    "however to describe the higher operations explicitly , this algebra has to be realised as a subspace of a usual associative algebra .    in this paper",
    ", we suggest to replace the condition of being reduced by a more functorial condition involving properties of operations only .",
    "more precisely , we consider a new type of algebras which we call @xmath16-algebras .",
    "an @xmath16-algebra is a graded vector space with an associative product @xmath17 of degree zero , and an @xmath0-ary operation @xmath18 of degree @xmath19 which satisfy the identity @xmath20 and the identities @xmath21 it turns out that the berger s",
    "candidate @xmath10 for the linear dual of space of syzygies admits the following presentation via generators and relations as a @xmath16-algebra .",
    "let @xmath22 be a finitely generated @xmath0-homogeneous algebra .",
    "then @xmath23 as @xmath16-algebras , where @xmath24 is viewed as a subspace of @xmath25 .    to prove this theorem , and in general to get a better understanding of @xmath16-algebras , we introduce a general notion of grbner bases for algebras over non - symmetric operads",
    ".    we also exhibit a precise equivalence between describing a free @xmath3-module resolution of the ground field @xmath26 and describing a model for  @xmath3 .",
    "overall , this demonstrates a clear analogy between the @xmath27 koszul duality theory of priddy and the higher koszul property for @xmath0-homogeneous algebras with @xmath13 .",
    "we were motivated to develop the higher koszul duality theory for @xmath0-homogeneous algebras in a way similar to the koszul duality for quadratic algebras in order to generalise it even further .",
    "some related work was done in @xcite for relations of weights @xmath28 and @xmath0 , and in @xcite for relations of weights  @xmath29 and @xmath30 , both greater than  @xmath28 .",
    "however , the results of @xcite demonstrate that even `` small '' resolutions may yield `` big '' @xmath14-algebra structures .",
    "and so it might make sense to refine the corresponding class of koszul algebras .",
    "we shall address this question in a future work .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : recoll ] , we recall some basic notions and results we use throughout the paper . in section  [ sec : grobner ] , we introduce grbner bases for non - symmetric operads and for algebras over a non - symmetric operad , and we formulate the key results about them . in section  [ sec : operadb ] , we introduce @xmath16-algebras and compute its reduced grbner basis . in section  [ sec : present ] , we prove the theorem stated above , and use it to formulate an equivalent criterion for an @xmath0-homogeneous algebra to be @xmath0-koszul . in section  [ sec : higherkoszul ] , we relate the construction of the free resolution of the trivial @xmath3-module and the construction of a dg algebra resolution of  @xmath3 , using the language of twisting morphisms .",
    "we work over a ground field @xmath26 .",
    "the word `` algebra '' , unless otherwise specified , refers to an associative algebra .",
    "as above , @xmath0 is a positive integer greater than  @xmath28 .",
    "most of vector spaces that we use are bi - graded with finite - dimensional bi - graded components .",
    "the _ weight _",
    "grading is coming from the convention that we consider algebras with generators of weight  @xmath31 subject to homogeneous relations , and the _ ( homological ) degree _ is coming from the fact that our constructions produce chain complexes .",

    "we would like to express our appreciation to the max - planck institute for mathematics in bonn , where the work on this paper began , and to the university lyon  1 , where the paper was completed , for the joint invitation and the excellent working conditions .",
    "we are grateful to eric hoffbeck for many useful comments on the first draft of this paper .",
    "last but not the least , the first author wishes to thank the organisers of the workshop `` new developments in noncommutative algebra '' for a great opportunity to discuss some maths in the most beautiful scenery of the isle of skye ; he benefited from a few conversations with participants of that workshop , and is especially thankful to andrea solotar for explaining the key results of  @xcite .",
    "we shall recall the basic definitions and results used throughout the paper , however trying to keep this section reasonably concise . for details on associative algebras and operads and their homotopy theory we refer the reader to the book @xcite .",
    "an associative algebra @xmath3 presented by generators and relations , @xmath22 is said to be _ @xmath0-homogeneous _ if @xmath32 . in this case , the algebra @xmath3 is weight graded : @xmath33 .",
    "when @xmath34 is finite dimensional , the _ @xmath0-homogeneous dual algebra _ @xmath35 of an @xmath0-homogenenous algebra is defined by the formula @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the annihilator of @xmath38 under the natural pairing of vector spaces @xmath39 .    in the case",
    "@xmath27 , it turns out that various homological questions of @xmath3 admit natural answers in terms of the algebra @xmath35 which is , in that case , usually denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "however , in the case @xmath13 , only some of the homogeneous components of @xmath35 are relevant . we define the graded vector space @xmath10 by the formula @xmath40 where in addition to being of weight @xmath41 , @xmath42 is assigned the homological degree @xmath43 if @xmath44 and the homological degree @xmath45 is @xmath46 .",
    "the associative product on @xmath35 induces an associative product on @xmath10 ( whenever the product in @xmath35 ends up in a component absent in @xmath10 , the corresponding product is defined to be equal to zero ) .",
    "the algebra @xmath10 is called the _ koszul dual algebra _ of  @xmath3 .",
    "note that our notational convention differs somewhat from the one adopted in earlier literature @xcite ; we believe that it is strongly beneficial to use , for any homogeneous algebra @xmath3 , the notation @xmath6 for the space of syzygies of  @xmath3 , hence the change .",
    "we also put @xmath47 ( we use the convention that the dual of a graded space with finite - dimensional component is the direct sum of component - wise duals ) . since @xmath10 is weight - wise finite dimensional , @xmath6 is a coalgebra .",

    "its differential is the unique coderivation extending the product of @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the linear dual @xmath90 of the bar construction is a differential graded algebra , whose underlying cohomology groups are equal to the @xmath2-functor : @xmath91 as the homology of a dg algebra , the @xmath2-functor acquires a canonical associative product ; this algebra is called the _",
    "yoneda algebra_. moreover , using the homotopy transfer theorem @xcite , one can endow the @xmath2-functor with an @xmath14-algebra structure , which extends the yoneda product .",
    "we call it the _ yoneda @xmath14-algebra_. in the @xmath14-setting , we shall , for simplicity , mostly work with non - unital algebras , and therefore consider the augmentation ideal of the usual yoneda algebra .",

    "one of the reasons for the notion of a reduced @xmath15-algebra to be important is explained by the following theorem .",

    "we denote by  @xmath100 the category whose objects are finite ordered sets ( with order - preserving bijections as morphisms ) , and by @xmath101 the tensor category of graded vector spaces ( by definition , morphisms in that category are degree zero linear operators , and the symmetry isomorphism is given by the formula @xmath102 ) .",

    "the associativity and the unit condition for a monoid ensure that to know the non - symmetric operad structure on a collection it is sufficient to know all the _ partial compositions _ : those correspond to the surjections @xmath108 in formula   ( which we now apply in the case @xmath116 ) for which all the preimages except for @xmath117 for some fixed  @xmath118 consist of one element , and such that @xmath119 is equal to the unit , for @xmath120 .",

    "similarly to the case of associative algebras , a non - symmetric operad can be presented via generators and relations , that is , as a quotient of the free non - symmetric operad @xmath126 for some collection  @xmath127 .",

    "we use the notation @xmath132 for the underlying tree of a tree monomial  @xmath133 .",
