    "much of our efforts go into constructing the simplest solution to one of these problems .",
    "there is a premium on taut constructions narrowly tailored to solve our most precious problems .    with the coming of the lhc era , electroweak symmetry breaking and naturalness become the central focus for at least the initial phase of running .",
    "our community has had many ideas , the simplest being that a single scalar boson condenses to break the electroweak symmetry and simultaneously gives mass to all elementary particles .",
    "although a logical possibility , few believe the higgs boson alone is a viable option since it is so delicate to quantum corrections . for thirty years the beyond - the - standard model community has pursued various scenarios that support and protect the higgs boson from these destabilizing tendencies ( supersymmetry , cft , extra dimension , etc . ) , or have banished the offending fundamental scalar from nature ( technicolor , compositeness , higgsless models , etc . ) , while other ideas have found ways to push the problem to higher scales ( little higgs theories , etc . ) .",
    "of course there are too many ideas out there for all to be correct .",
    "nevertheless , if there are a thousand ideas and only one is right , it does not mean that the others were useless , just as when a thousand rescue volunteers are looking for a little girl lost in the woods and one finds her , it does not mean the others were useless .",
    "it may be argued that the only useless ideas are ones not grounded in rigor or are incompatible with past observations .",
    "this criteria for the worth of an idea is somewhat looser than the criteria we normally apply to theory in deciding what is good work .",
    "normally , we give our highest esteem to efforts that solve problems .",
    "we value invention over unmoored creativity .",
    "i once heard an inventor describe what he does as first asking  what sucks ? \" and then working day and night to make it better .",
    "that is what we mostly do in physics .",
    "we worship inventions .",
    "we dislike the sm higgs boson and its quantum instability .",
    "this leads us to invent technicolor , supersymmetry , extra dimensions , etc .   and",
    "then further invent solutions to their iatrogenic illnesses .",
    "this formula is rather human - centric because we care most about _ our _ problems  at the core , they are the problems associated with understanding the particles that make up our bodies . surely , there is more to the universe than that .",
    "a more universalist approach asks rather ",
    "what s possible ?",
    "\" there is great danger in this approach , since a whole lot more things are possible than are even probable .",
    "what then can discipline us ?",
    "a new answer to this question is the large hadron collider .",
    "the lhc era beckons us to approach physics less as an inventor and more humbly as a universalist .",
    "the beckoning is due to the filtering opportunity of experiment , and the impertinent susurrations that we shall fall short if we only take seriously our inventions .",
    "agreeing to the lhc as the primary disciplinarian of our creativity can yield a deeper interpretation of the data and perhaps may lead to new discoveries that were not anticipated .",
    "thus , it is the existence of the lhc that propels me to write about hidden worlds , or hidden sectors@xcite .",
    "i could argue some second - order problem - solving explanation for why we must all care about this issue , by telling you that many ideas of physics beyond the sm have sectors in addition to the sm that are hard to get rid of .",
    "i could also describe why landscape studies imply the existence of even hundreds of possible new sectors@xcite that have nothing directly to do with solving any deep problem in nature that we recognize .",
    "no , instead , despite the motivating paralepsis , the physics of this chapter has but one core reason for cogitation : it can be discovered at the lhc .",
    "the definition of  hidden \" that i use here is the collection of particles that are not the sm , that are not charged under sm gauge groups , and that do not couple via gauge interactions to sm particles .",
    "the possibilities are numerous",
    ". we can envision analogous copies of the sm charged under new gauge groups @xmath0 .",
    "we can envision pure singlet states .",
    "we can envision gauge fields of exotic gauge groups of large dimensionality .",
    "very little experimental data bears on the question of whether such sectors exist .",
    "it is not assured that we shall be able to discern the existence of a hidden world .",
    "all we can do is identify opportunities and explore them .",
    "of course , any gauge invariant and lorenz invariant operator of the sm @xmath1 can be paired with a similar operator from the hidden sector @xmath2 to form @xmath3 .",
    "if this resulting operator is irrelevant ( dimension @xmath4 ) it will be suppressed by some unknown scale @xmath5 .",
    "we have no _ a piori _ idea what scale @xmath5 should be ; however , we know that if it is above a few tev it is unlikely we shall see evidence of this interaction due to decoupling .",
    "the sm however does have two operators that are gauge - invariant and relevant ( dimension @xmath6 ) : the hypercharge field strength tensor @xmath7 and the higgs modulus squared @xmath8 .",
    "these two operators give us hope that we can couple to a hidden sector in a relevant or marginal way ( dimension @xmath9 ) , thereby enabling a search for a hidden world via the hypercharge gauge boson or the higgs boson of the sm .",
    "indeed , both of these operators can be exploited in the above - stated way to explore the simplest , non - trivial hidden sector that couples to @xmath7 and @xmath10 : @xmath11 gauge theory with a complex higgs boson @xmath12 that breaks the symmetry upon condensation .",

    "in other words , a vast region of parameter space is completely compatible with the precision electroweak data .",

    "these effects can be computing in an effective peskin - takeuchi parameter analysis@xcite .",
    "one finds that the three most important observables for constraining new physics by precision electroweak observables are m_w & = & ( 17 ) + _ l^+l^- & = & -(80 ) + ^2_w^eff & = & -(0.00033)where ( ) ^2()^2 .",
    "experimental measurements@xcite imply that @xmath61 .",
    "kinetic mixing at the level of @xmath62 is not constrained if @xmath35 is greater than a few hundred gev , and there is essentially no constraint if @xmath35 is greater than about a tev .",
    "this is consistent with the pdg analysis of constraints on other @xmath48 bosons@xcite . for lighter @xmath35 , which we will also concern ourselves with",
    ", the constraint is not difficult to satisfy as long as @xmath63 .",
    "a pure singlet higgs boson causes no concern for precision electroweak observables , but after mixing the coupling of the higgs to the gauge bosons is shared by two states of different masses .",
    "the leading order way to account for this is to first recognize that in the sm the higgs boson mass constraints is succinctly summarized as@xcite ( m_higgs/1  gev ) = 1.93^+0.16_-0.17 .",
    "when two states , such as ours , mix and share the electroweak coupling , this constraint becomes to leading order c_h^2 ( ) + s_h^2 ( ) 1.93^+0.16_-0.17  .",
    "[ mhmh_fit.eq ] there is very little difficulty in exploring large regions of parameter space where the precision electroweak implications of this multi - higgs boson theory are in agreement with all data@xcite .",
    "other constraints , such as perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability have been analyzed elsewhere@xcite and also can be accomodated easily within the theory .",
    "how do we find evidence for hahm at colliders ?",
    "the main implication of hahm is the different spectrum it implies compared to the sm spectrum of states :    * the existence of a new gauge boson @xmath48 that couples to sm states according to the strength of the kinetic mixing parameter . * the existence of two cp - even higgs boson mass eigenstates , both of which couple to sm states by virtue of the mixing of the hahm higgs boson with the sm higgs boson .",
    "these two simple qualitative facts , combined with the details of the hahm langrangian enable us to explore many possible interesting implications for the lhc .    in the next few paragraphs",
    "i shall discuss a few of these implications .",
    "the reader should keep in mind that not all cases are simultaneously allowed by the theory .",
    "each phenomenological manifestation i discuss can be considered the dominant interesting signal in a subset of the parameter space , not in all of parameter space .",
    "_ signal # 1 : universal suppression of higgs boson signal _",
    "let us suppose that the two higgs bosons mix , such that the lightest higgs boson is mostly sm , and the heavier higgs boson eigenstate is mostly singlet .",
    "let us further suppose that the additional @xmath48 higgs boson is sufficiently heavy or weakly coupled that is has no role in the phenomenology . in this case , the primary signal will be that the light higgs mass eigenstate couples to the sm states in exactly the same way as the sm higgs except there is a universal suppression of all interactions due to the mixing angle .    thus the cross - section is reduced by a factor of ( vvh)(m_h)=c_h^2(vvh_sm)(m_h )",
    "this implies that no state in the spectrum of higgs bosons has a production cross - section as large as the sm higgs boson , making production , and thus detection , more difficult .",
    "production is only half of the story when discussing detectability .",
    "one must also consider how the branching fraction changes .",
    "of course , if there is only a universal suppression of couplings , the branching fractions will be identical to those of the sm higgs boson . however , if there are exotic matter states in the hahm model in addition to just the @xmath58 boson and its associated symmetry - breaking @xmath12 boson , the lightest higgs might decay into them .",
    "if the exotic states are stable on detector time scales it would contribute to the invisible width of the higgs boson @xmath64 , which depends on exotic sector couplings , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . the branching fraction into visible states is then reduced and computed by b_i(h)=.    the effect of this universal suppression was studied in the context of hidden sectors@xcite and also in a related context of extra - dimensional theories@xcite .",
    "of course , this signal is not unique to the hahm , as any singlet higgs boson that gets a vacuum expectation value could mimic it .",
    "however , a singlet with a vacuum expectation value is likely to have gauge charge , but it is not necessary that it be exclusively abelian and kinetic mix with hypercharge .",
    "thus , the universal suppression of the higgs boson phenomenology is more general than just hahm .",
    "_ signal # 2 : @xmath67 _    another broad implication of mixing with a singlet higgs boson is the existence of a heavier higgs boson that couples to sm states and can decay into a pair of lighter higgs bosons .",
    "this has been discussed in detail in the context of hahm@xcite . there , an example model was studied where m_h=300 ,  m_h=115 ,  c_h^2= thus , the decay of @xmath67 is kinematically allowed in this case , and the relevant branching fraction is @xmath68 .",
    "one of the most useful signals to find this decay chain is when one light higgs decays to @xmath69 , which it is most apt to do , and the other decays to the rarer @xmath70 .",
    "the signal is reduced substantially by requiring this lower probability @xmath71 final state , but the background is reduced by even more .",
    "it is found that with @xmath72 the total expected signal event rate after relevant cuts and identification criteria are applied@xcite is 8.2 on a background of 0.3 .",
    "[ fig : bbgammagamma ] shows the differential cross - section as a function of invariant mass of @xmath71 for these events .",
    "invariant mass in @xmath73 production . ]    in the above example the lighter higgs boson is light ",
    "right at the edge of the current sm limits  and decays preferentially to @xmath74 .",
    "if the lighter higgs boson is heavier than this , the decay to @xmath75 starts to become dominant . the cross - over point where @xmath76 is about @xmath77 . for this case of @xmath78",
    ", it is more fruitful to exploit the @xmath79 missing @xmath80 signature .",
    "an analysis of this final state has been shown@xcite to be a promising approach to finding @xmath67 at the lhc .",
    "_ signal # 3 : trans - tev narrow higgs boson _    within the sm the higgs boson becomes so broad when its mass is above about @xmath81 that it starts to become meaningless to even call it a particle .",
    "there is no sense in which a trans - tev higgs boson resonance can be found within standard higgs boson phenomenology at the lhc .",
    "however , in the mixed boson sector induced by hahm , we find that a higgs boson just like the sm can exist , except its couplings are universally suppressed by a factor of @xmath66 compared to the sm higgs boson .",
    "thus , a reasonably narrow trans - tev higgs boson can be in the spectrum , and can be searched for at the lhc .",
    "the narrowness of the higgs boson is also correlated with a low production cross - section , and so the biggest challenge is simply getting enough events to even analyse .",
    "once they are produced , distinguishing them from background is made possible by the very high energy invariant mass and transverse mass reconstructions .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : mlvjj ] the invariant mass distribution of @xmath82 ( missing @xmath80 vector used for @xmath83 ) is plotted for the signal ( @xmath84 ) of a @xmath85 higgs boson and compared to the distributions of the most significant backgrounds from @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    "nevertheless , it is possible to find evidence for it with enough integrated luminosity , which the lhc should attain in time .",
    "the signal significance will increase when all possible channels are included .",
    "an even more challenging final state to consider is @xmath89 .",
    "the most significant background is @xmath90 .",

    "[ fig : mt ] shows the transverse mass of @xmath59 with missing @xmath80 for a different signal topology ( @xmath91 ) and compared with the most significant background , @xmath90 .",

    "there is a staggeringly large literature on the search for @xmath48 bosons at colliders@xcite , but usually little emphasis is put on treating the overall coupling strength as a free parameter that could be very small@xcite .",
    "indeed , the kinetic mixing is normally expected to be maybe loop level for theories of this kind , which would imply a rather small coupling of the @xmath48 to sm states .",

    "compare that with the very difficult normal searches of the higgs boson with mass @xmath110 , which is made even more difficult when its production cross - section is reduced , by @xmath111 in this case .",
    "the discussion in this chapter has all been about physics that attaches itself to the sm relevant operators . however , there are many reasons to believe that the sm sector can not stand alone in the operation of symmetry breaking and mass generation .",
    "we expect new non - hidden particles , such as superpartners and kk excitations , etc .",
    ", that solve the problems we have identified with the sm .",
    "some people wish that we will discover something totally new and unexpected .",

    "the lhc is just as much a philosophy experiment as a physics experiment .",
    "the impacting issue is  to what degree can humans discern nature from pure thought ?",
    "\" arguably we have had some success already in the past , but would anything in the past compare , for example , to postulating that supersymmetry cures the hierarchy problem if it turns out to be correct ? it would certify that humans can see around the corner and discern deep new principles into the energy frontier . if we get that right , no idea would be too esoteric , and no scale would be too remote or inaccessible for humans to discuss with confidence and expectation for understanding .",
    "thus , i hope and expect that we find new physics that explains by principle the stability of the electroweak scale from ideas that we have already developed .",
    "how does this impact the hahm discussion presented above ?",
    "first , if it is supersymmetry then it is likely to merely complicate the discussion above , as many new states will be produced and will decay in the detector , and the number of higgs bosons will be greater , making simple mixing angle factors such as @xmath113 from our @xmath114 matrix into more complicated combinations of mixing angles such as @xmath115 .",
    "the origin of the  hidden sector \" higgs mixing with mssm higgs is most likely to be from the renormalizable coupling in the superpotential : @xmath116 , which yields @xmath117-type couplings in the @xmath118-term lagrangian directly analogous to the @xmath119 mixing terms we have discussed here .",
    "thus , the basic ideas shine through in the higgs sector and analyses similar to those discussed above can be applicable .",
    "of course , if the stability of the electroweak scale is explained by the banishment of all fundamental scalars from nature , then additional higgs boson mixing may not be relevant , but perhaps an effective higgs boson mixing theory with composite higgs bosons would be a useful description",
    ". this would be highly model dependent , and the data from lhc will have to guide us to decide if there is a path by which we can interpret electroweak symmetry breaking by effective higgs boson scalars .",
