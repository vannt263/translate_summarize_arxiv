    "the description of radiating bhs by hawking @xcite offered the first physically relevant ``  peep  '' on the mysteries of quantum gravity .",
    "after more than forty years of intensive research in this field ( see @xcite and @xcite for a recent review with an extensive reference list ) various aspects of the problem still remain to be properly explained .",
    "for example , a satisfactory description of the terminal stage of bh evaporation remains still to be understood .",
    "so far , the string theory seems to be the best candidate for self - consistent , ultraviolet completion of gravity at the planck scale . on the other hand , following bekenstein s idea , the bh entropy is formally identified with the area of the event horizon in planck units .",
    "thus , combining hawking s definition of bh temperature with the area law gives a consistent thermodynamical description of semi - classical bhs dynamics .",
    "however , to give a physical ground to this interpretation one needs a proper identification of bh micro - states , i.e. a complete statistical interpretation of entropy .",
    "beforehand one can say that the number of micro - states has to grow exponentially with the area , but the physical meaning of these micro - states is elusive in this semi - classical quantum framework .",
    "contrary to the classical gas thermodynamics , where the entropy is a function of the volume enclosing the system , in the bh case entropy is a function of the area of the object indicating that the eventual bh micro - states should lie somewhere on the horizon surface instead of in the internal volume + interestingly enough , in string theory the degeneracy of excitation states also shows the same exponential growth .",
    "this suggests an identification among highly excited string states and bh micro - states .",
    "however , a more precise stringy formulation of bhs requires a non - perturbative formulation of string theory itself , including the interaction with higher dimensional objects , i.e. d - branes .",
    "so far , this approach provides the correct entropy counting bh micro - states at least in a limited number of cases , but not yet in general .",
    "+ in this chapter we would like to review a ``  phenomenological  '' approach taking into account the most fundamental feature of string theory or , more in general , of quantum gravity , whatever its origin , which is the existence of a _ minimal length _ in the space - time fabric @xcite .",
    "this length is , so far , identified with the planck length , or the string length , but nothing prevents it from being much longer , even down to the tev region . a simple and effective way to keep track of the modifications of bh geometries , due to",
    "the presence of the minimal length , is to solve the einstein equations with an energy momentum tensor describing non point - like matter .",
    "+ at first glance , one could think of modifying the four dimensional einstein action to incorporate minimal length effects . to solve the modified field equations",
    "can be quite complicated .",
    "this is the case , where minimal length is introduced in the einstein theory through the , so - called , `` star - product '' , i.e. the standard product between fields is replaced by a non - commutative product operation making even the simplest field theory non - local and impossible to solve .",
    "the only way to handle non - local field theories is in a truncated perturbative expansion suppressing non - locality and introducing spurious derivative interactions . in the resulting approximate theory ,",
    "the effect of the minimal length as a natural short - distance cut - off is lost and paradoxically infrared divergences appear even in the massive case and mix with the persisting ultraviolet divergences .",
    "a typical example of a `` ... cure killing the patient ! ''",
    ". + the star - product approach , while formally correct is of little practical use .",
    "for example , bh perturbative solutions of `` starred - product '' einstein equations , manifest the same pathological short distance behavior of the corresponding standard solutions , in spite of introducing a short - distance cut - off @xcite .",
    "+ we argued that an alternative approach is to implement the minimal length _ only _ in the matter source .",
    "the line of reasoning is the following .",
    "the metric field is a geometrical structure defined over an underlying manifold and the curvature is a measure of the strength of the metric field .",
    "thus , it is the response to the presence of a mass - energy distribution .",
    "the minimal length is an intrinsic property of the manifold itself , rather than a super - imposed geometrical structure .",
    "it affects gravity in a subtle , indirect way : it smears matter eliminating point - like objects as physical sources of the gravitational field . as a matter of fact",
    ", this idea goes hand - in - hand with the fundamental idea of string theory : `` particles '' are not matter - points , rather they are extended , one dimensional objects , whose length is of the order of the planck length , or any other fundamental length scale . following the above reasoning , we conclude that in general relativity the effects of the minimal length can be taken into account by _ keeping the standard form _ of the einstein tensor in the l.h.s . of the field equations and introducing a _ modified energy - momentum tensor _ as a source in the r.h.s .",
    "+ at this point one may object that the textbook approach defines bhs as `` matter - free '' solutions of the field equations . even in the case of the reissner - nordstrm bh , the energy momentum tensor _ only _ describes the electric field .",
    "+ this way of introducing bhs is , at least , misleading and contradicts the fundamental ideas of general relativity that the geometry of space - time is determined by the energy - momentum distribution.the _ only _ globally defined matter - free solution of the einstein equations is minkowski space - time .",
    "furthermore , solving `` in vacuum '' faces the problem of _ a posteriori _ determination of various integration constants .",
    "a crystal clear example of this difficulty is the kerr solution , where integration constants are fixed by comparison with the geometry of a slowly rotating sphere , while everybody is aware that the rotating sphere is _ not _ the source of the the kerr gravitation field !",
    "+ furthermore , the symmetry of the `` vacuum '' solution , has to be imposed _ a priori _ ,",
    "since there is noting in the field equations that can do the job for you .",
    "+ all the above mentioned ambiguities disappear once a proper matter source is introduced in the einstein equations .",
    "a well known example , in quantum field theory , of difficulties related to modeling elementary particles as structureless point like objects , is the appearance of ultraviolet infinities .",
    "when computing one - loop feynman graphs , one finds infinite , unphysical , amplitudes for measurable processes .",
    "the simplest `` cure '' of the infinity disease is to introduce a suitable short - distance cut - off , which in coordinate - space is simply a `` minimal length '' .",
    "once divergent parts of the amplitudes are subtracted away , the ( arbitrary ) cut - off is replaced by sum physically meaningful quantity through a `` re - normalization '' , i.e. re - parametrization , of the theory .",
    "+ following this philosophy , we propose to re - normalize the curvature singularity in a bh geometry in a similar fashion .",
    "+ first , let us cut - off the singularity by introducing a minimal length into the line element .",
    "+ second , relate the minimal length to the radius of the smallest physically meaningful,_extremal _ bh . +",
    "this two - step procedure will be first applied to the simples case of schwarzschild bh . in order to remove the curvature singularity in @xmath3",
    ", we introduce the simplest kind of short - distance cutoff through the replacement    @xmath4    where , @xmath5 is , for the moment , an arbitrary length scale . according with the framework one has in mind",
    ", @xmath5 can be thought of as the characteristic length scale of the underlying quantum theory of gravity ( whatever it is ) , i.e. the planck length , the string length , etc . in the technically much more involved approach of `` asymptotically safe '' quantum gravity , a similar `` cutoff identification ''",
    "was introduced in @xcite for the same purpose.,[multiblock footnote omitted ] by skipping all the approach - dependent technicalities we write a regularized schwarzschild metric as    @xmath6    where    @xmath7    from the equation ( [ massar ] ) one sees the @xmath8 at large distance , i.e. @xmath9 , while in the opposite limit @xmath10 . as a consequence the metric approaches the standard form of the schwarzschild line element at large distance , and the desitter metric    @xmath11    at short distance , with an effective cosmological constant @xmath12 .",
    "the desitter geometry is known to be curvature singularity - free . as a matter of fact",
    ", we have replaced a physically meaningless infinite curvature point with a central desitter condensate , where the curvature can be very high but finite .",
    "the physical mechanism leading to the disappearance of the singularity is clear , as the desitter vacuum exerts a _ negative _ pressure balancing the gravitation pull towards the center .",
    "thus , close to the origin , collapsed matter is supported by the negative pressure of the desitter vacuum and can attain an equilibrium configuration .",
    "+ step two , requires to identify the physical meaning of @xmath5 through an in depth study of the bh geometry .",
    "+ the eventual horizons are obtained from the equation[multiblock footnote omitted ] :    @xmath13     plot of the function in equation ( [ horeq0 ] ) , width=302 ]    the function ( [ horeq ] ) has a single minimum in    @xmath14    describing an `` _ _ extremal _ _ '' bh in the sense that for any @xmath15 , the radius of the outer horizon , @xmath16 , is larger than @xmath5 .",
    "the extremal bh can be understood as the thermodynamical equivalent of the `` minimal volume '' of a real gas @xmath17 . as it known , the entropy of the gas is of the form @xmath18 leading to @xmath19 for @xmath20 . in the bh case ,",
    "the role of the gas with volume @xmath17 is played by the extremal bh which is expected to have zero entropy in agreement with the third law of thermodynamics . + a second , inner horizon @xmath21 , exists for any non - extremal configuration ( see fig.([mass ] ) ) . @xmath22 and @xmath21 merge into @xmath23 for @xmath24 . for @xmath25 no bh exists",
    "thus , @xmath5 has been promoted from an arbitrary parameter with length dimension , to radius of the horizon of the minimal size extremal bh .",
    "@xcite , there is no physical way to probe sub - planckian distances @xcite . ]",
    "+ contrary to the case of the `` bare '' schwarzschild bh , the renormalized metric admits and extremal configuration even in the absence of electric charge and angular momentum .",
    "+ the existence of a de sitter region at short distance , indicates the presence of a non - trivial energy - momentum tensor sourcing the renormalized metric ( [ rbh ] ) .",
    "this energy - momentum tensor must approach a cosmological form at short - distance .",
    "the energy density for a spherically symmetric mass distribution is given by    @xmath26    let us remark that the invariant energy dentity is finite everywhere . in particular @xmath27 and this is a necessary condition to avoid the appearance of a curvature singularity in the origin .",
    "+ the complete energy momentum tensor encodes energy and pressure distributions of an anisotropic fluid @xcite given by    @xmath28    where , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 follows from the energy - momentum tensor covariant divergence - free condition .",
    "@xmath32 is finite everywhere as well .",
    "thus , we have a regular source leading to the everywhere finite curvature geometry described by the line element ( [ rbh ] ) .",
    "the thermodynamical description of bh starts with the computation of the hawking temperature defined as the surface gravity of the killing horizon over @xmath33 :    @xmath34    in our case , @xmath35 and ( [ th ] ) leads to    @xmath36    first , we notice that @xmath37 vanishes at the extremal configuration , @xmath38 , which eliminates the pathological behavior of the schwarzschild solution at the final phase of the evaporation . @xmath37 increases with increasing radius up to a maximum value at @xmath39 , then approaches zero as @xmath40",
    ". +     plot of the hawking temperature as a function of the horizon radius.,width=302 ]    another important thermodynamical quantity assigned to the bh is its entropy .",
    "after the bekenstein / hawking results , it is customary to identify the entropy with @xmath41 of the horizon area in planck units",
    ". suppose we have a planckian bh with radius and mass given by    @xmath42    where , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the planck length and mass . continuing the previous discussion , the extremal bhs correspond to the molecular volume . in a statistical description",
    "the extremal bh should correspond to a macro - state realized by a _",
    "single _ micro - state and , thus , has zero entropy .",
    "+ apart from the general assumption of the validity of the area law , one should be able to calculate it in the same way as it is calculated for a real gas , i.e. from the first law of thermodynamics . in the case of a bh",

    "it is crucial to remark that the integration of ( [ ds ] ) , leading to ( [ entropy ] ) , is bounded from below by the radius @xmath23 of the extremal configuration as there are no smaller bhs .",
    "+ thus , we obtain the generalized ``  area law  '' which also gives the form of the entropy satisfying the third law .",
    "it contains further corrections induced by the presence of the minimal length . for the `` bare '' schwarzschild metric",
    "there is no extremal , minimal size , configuration and the corresponding entropy is simply on fourth of the area . assuming that this is a `` universal '' behavior for all bhs , leads to an inconsistency with the third law , i.e. zero - temperature extremal bhs with non - zero entropy .",
    "thus , even in the absence of a minimal length , whenever a bh admits an extremal configuration , the correct way to calculate the entropy is by integrating the first law from the minimal radius of the extremal configuration and not from zero . the correct definition of entropy is given by the difference of the area of the non - extremal configuration and the extremal one .      in this subsection we are going to study eventual phase transitions of regular neutral bhs .",
    "we follow the analogy with finite temperature quantum field theory where different vacuum phases are studied in terms of the stationary points of effective potential .",
    "the order parameter is the vacuum expectation value of some scalar field operator expressed as a function of the temperature .",
    "different phases correspond to different vacuum expectation values .",
    "+ in our case off - shell free energy , @xmath51 plays the role of the effective potential while the order parameter is represented by the radius of the bh .",
    "different phases correspond to different size bhs .",
    "the advantage of using the _ off - shell free energy _ is that @xmath52 is a free parameter describing the evolution from non - equilibrium , @xmath53 , to @xmath54 states when the bh is in equilibrium with the surrounding thermal bath .",
    "@xmath55    we look for the extremal of @xmath51 which corresponds to equilibrium configurations .",
    "@xmath56    the extrema of ( [ fofff ] ) are solutions of the condition    @xmath57    equation ( [ fprimo ] ) determines the free parameter @xmath52 as a function of @xmath22    @xmath58    proving the general property that the extrema of @xmath59 corresponds to bhs in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding heat bath",
    ". + if we were able to invert ( [ teq ] ) we could find the way in which the order parameter @xmath22 evolves by varying @xmath52 , as in the finite temperature quantum field theory .",
    "unfortunately , the equation is fourth order and can not be easily and transparently solved .",
    "however , we can obtain simple analytic solutions by considering the near - extremal and large radius limits for low temperature bhs .",

    "in fact , the free energy is unbounded from below for large bhs which are colder than the surrounding heat bath . as a consequence they continue to grow never reaching an equilibrium configuration .",
    "this behavior follows from the `` competition '' between the internal energy end entropy entering @xmath59 with opposite sign .",

    "thus , the negative entropy term dominate over the positive internal energy contribution beyond some critical size .",
    "this pathological behavior will be cured in the next section by introducing an anti de sitter background whose negative ( inward ) pressure will stop this unlimited expansion . +",
    "a further increase in @xmath52 leads to a critical value , @xmath64 , where the maximum and the minimum merge into an inflexion point .",
    "remarkably , @xmath70 , where only one unstable bh exists .",

    "the results obtained in the previous discussion indicate that there is a minimal size ( extremal ) bh even of planckian dimension , as well as the corresponding minimal area .",
    "thus , we are led to an interesting conjecture , i.e. an holographically improved `` bohr quantization '' of the bh . instead of quantizing the mass of the bh , we rather quantize its area in terms of the minimal area of the extremal configuration    @xmath79    it follows from ( [ an ] ) that the radius of the horizon increases according with    @xmath80    by inserting ( [ rn ] ) into ( [ horeq ] ) we obtain the quantized mass spectrum as :    @xmath81    for large @xmath82 .",

    "the bh instability towards a limitless growth one introduces a negative cosmological constant in the einstein equations and solve them with the energy - momentum tensor ( [ source ] ) . + from a physical point of view , a negative cosmological constant represents a positive ( inward pushing ) vacuum pressure    @xmath87    making an unbounded inflation energetically disfavored . +",
    "a further motivation for studying ads bhs is that in higher dimensions they have a pivotal role in the implementation of the @xmath88 duality @xcite . this kind of duality offers a powerful tool to tackle non - perturbative features of a variety of physical systems ranging from the quark - gluon plasma @xcite to fluids @xcite and super - conductors @xcite .",
