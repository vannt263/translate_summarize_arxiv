    "in recent years supernova ia ( snia ) observations show that the expansion of the universe is accelerating @xcite contrary to friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmological models , with non - relativistic matter and radiation . also cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) data @xcite is suggesting that the expansion of our universe seems to be in an accelerated state .",
    "this is referred to `` dark energy '' effect @xcite .",
    "cosmological constant , @xmath0 , as usual vacuum energy can be responsible for this evolution by providing a negative pressure @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the observed value of @xmath1 is @xmath2 orders of magnitude smaller than the one computed from field theory methods @xcite .",
    "quintessence is an alternative to consider a dynamical vacuum energy @xcite , involving one or two scalar fields , some with potentials justified from supergravity theories @xcite .",
    "however , the fine - tuning problem of these models which arise from cosmic coincidence issue has no satisfactory solution .",
    "the chaplygin gas model is an interesting proposal @xcite , describing a transition from a universe filled with dust - like matter to an accelerating expanding stage .",
    "this model was later generalized in ref .",
    "the generalized chaplygin gas model is described by a perfect fluid obeying an exotic equation of state @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a positive constant and @xmath5 .",
    "the standard chaplygin gas @xcite corresponds to @xmath6 .",
    "some publications @xcite and reviews @xcite which studied the chaplygin gas cosmological models have already appeared in the literature .",
    "recently , quantum mechanical description of a frw model with a generalized chaplygin gas has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to retrieve explicit mathematical expressions for the different quantum mechanical states and determine the transition probabilities towards an accelerated stage . in this paper",
    "we investigate the existence of singularities at quantum level in chaplygin gas cosmological models . in the quantum cosmology the wheeler - dewitt ( wd ) equation in minisuperspace which determines the wave function of the universe ,",
    "can be constructed using adm decomposition of the geometry @xcite in the hamiltonian formalism of general relativity .",
    "the presence of matter in quantum cosmology needs further consideration and can be described by fundamental fields , as done in ref .",
    "@xcite . using wkb approximation",
    "one can predict the behavior of the quantum universe which leads to determination of the trajectories in phase space .",
    "however , even in the minisuperspace , general exact solutions are hard to find , the hilbert space structure is obscure and it is a subtle matter to recover the notion of a semiclassical time @xcite .    in the present work , we describe matter as a chaplygin gas .",
    "this description is essentially semiclassical from the start , but it has the advantage of furnishing a variable , connected with the matter degrees of freedom , which can naturally be identified with time , leading to a well - defined hilbert space structure .",
    "it is very convenient to construct a quantum chaplygin gas model .",
    "schutz s formalism @xcite gives dynamics to the fluid degrees of freedom in interaction with the gravitational field .",
    "using proper canonical transformations , at least one conjugate momentum operator associated with matter appears linearly in the action integral .",
    "therefore , a schrdinger - like equation can be obtained with the matter variable playing the role of time .    here",
    ", we use the formalism of quantum cosmology in order to quantize three friedmann - robertson - walker chaplygin gas models in the presence of a negative cosmological constant . in sec .",
    "2 the quantum cosmological model with a chaplygin gas as the matter content is constructed in schutz s formalism @xcite , and the schrdinger - wheeler - dewitt ( swd ) equation in minisuperspace is written down to quantize the model .",
    "the wave - function depends on the scale factor @xmath7 and on the canonical variable associated to the fluid , which in the schutz variational formalism plays the role of time @xmath8 .",
    "we separate the wave - function into two parts , one depending solely on the scale factor and the other depending only on the time .",
    "the solution in the time sector of the swd equation is trivial , leading to imaginary exponentials of the type @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the system energy and @xmath11 . in sec .",
    "4 we construct wave packets from the eigenfunctions and compute the time - dependent expectation values of the scale factors . in sec . 5",
    ", we present our conclusions .",
    "we need the hamiltonian for a chaplygin gas model in the formalism developed by schutz .",
    "the starting point is the action for gravity plus chaplygin gas , which in this formalism is written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the extrinsic curvature and @xmath14 is the induced metric over the three - dimensional spatial hypersurface , which is the boundary @xmath15 of the four dimensional manifold @xmath16 .",
    "units are chosen such that the factor @xmath17 becomes equal to one .",
    "the first two terms were first obtained in @xcite ; the last term of ( [ action ] ) represents the matter contribution to the total action and @xmath18 is the pressure . in schutz s formalism",
    "@xcite the fluid s four - velocity is expressed in terms of five potentials @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the specific enthalpy .",
    "the variable @xmath23 is the specific entropy , while the potentials @xmath20 and @xmath21 are connected with rotation and are absent in models of the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) type .",
    "the variables @xmath19 and @xmath22 have no clear physical meaning .",

    "therefore , it requires the following approximation @xcite , @xmath39 .",

    "choosing the gauge @xmath48 , we have the following solutions for the system @xmath49 imposing the standard quantization conditions on the canonical momenta and demanding that the super - hamiltonian operator annihilate the wave function , we are led to the following swd equation in minisuperspace ( @xmath50 ) @xmath51 in this equation , @xmath52 corresponds to the time coordinate . as discussed in @xcite , in order for the hamiltonian operator @xmath53 to be self - adjoint the inner product of any two wave functions @xmath19 and @xmath54 must take the form @xmath55 moreover , the wave functions should satisfy the restrictive boundary conditions @xmath56 the swd equation ( [ sle ] ) can be solved by separation of variables as follows @xmath57 where the @xmath7 dependent part of the wave function ( @xmath58 ) satisfies @xmath59 and the prime means derivative with respect to @xmath7 .",

    "however , neither of the boundary conditions ( [ boundary ] ) can be satisfied by the these wave functions .    in the @xmath90 case the equation ( [ sle2 ] )",
    "reduces to @xmath91 where the solutions are @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are whittaker functions .",
    "the whittaker functions do not automatically vanish at @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , in order to satisfy @xmath96 it is necessary to take both @xmath97 and @xmath98 , the same is applied to the second of the boundary conditions ( [ boundary ] ) .",
    "in this work we have investigated closed , flat , and open minisuperspace frw quantum cosmological models ( @xmath99 ) with chaplygin gas universes .",
    "the use of schutz s formalism for chaplygin gas allowed us to obtain a swd equation in which the only remaining matter degree of freedom played the role of time .",
    "we have obtained eigenfunctions and therefore acceptable wave packets were constructed by appropriate linear combination of these eigenfunctions .",
    "the time evolution of the expectation value of the scale factor has been determined in the spirit of the many - worlds interpretation of quantum cosmology .",
