    "perhaps the most interesting application of these techniques to rational tangle replacement is the following theorem , which generalizes some results of eudave - muoz and scharlemann :    suppose that @xmath8 is a knot or link in @xmath10 and that @xmath15 is a 3ball intersecting @xmath8 so that @xmath16 is a rational tangle .",
