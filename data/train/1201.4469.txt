    "practice , the estimation of power spectra in stationary time - series often relies on second - order statistics .",
    "the premise is that these are moments of an underlying power spectral distribution the true power spectrum .",
    "thus , the question arises as to how much is `` knowable '' about the distribution of power in the spectrum from such statistics .",
    "asymptotically , as more data accrue the convergence is guaranteed in a suitable sense , but the practical question remains on how to bound the error when only limited information is available . to this end , it is important to consider how a finite set of statistics localizes the power spectrum .",
    "traditionally , for many applications , one relies on a particular power spectrum selected out of a variety of methods that lead to specific choices , all consistent ( in different ways ) with the recorded data and the estimated moments . historically , burg s algorithm and the maximum entropy spectrum , and the pisarenko harmonic decomposition are specific such choices @xcite and so are the correlogram and the periodogram .",
    "thus , in general , there exists a large family of admissible power spectra which are all consistent . bounding the values of admissible spectral density functions",
    "is an ill - posed problem ( see section  [ sec : weakmetrics ] ) . instead",
    ", the natural way to quantify power spectral uncertainty is by bounding the power on ( measurable ) subsets of the frequency band .",
    "therefore , the goal of this paper is to consider the appropriate topology  the so - called weak topology , and to develop suitable metrics that can be used to quantify and measure power spectral uncertainty .    throughout",
    ", we consider stochastic processes @xmath0 which are discrete - time , zero - mean , and second - order stationary . a typical set of statistics for a stationary stochastic process is a finite set of covariance ( or , autocorrelation ) samples .",
    "the covariance samples @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the expectation operator , provide moment constraints for the power spectrum @xmath3 of the process : @xmath4 the power spectrum is thought of as a non - negative measure on the unit circle @xmath5\\}$ ] ( for notational simplicity also identified with the interval @xmath6 $ ] ) .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath7 to denote the class of such measures and the problem of determining @xmath8 from the covariance samples ( finitely or infinitely many ) is known as the trigonometric moment problem .",
    "classical theory on this problem originates in the work of toeplitz and carathodory at the turn of the 20@xmath9 century and has evolved into a rather deep chapter of functional analysis and of operator theory @xcite .",
    "the classical monograph by geronimus @xcite contains a wide range of results on the trigonometric moment problem , the asymptotic behavior of solutions , spectral factors and optimal predictors , as well as explicit expressions for spectral envelops ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem @xmath10 ) ( c.f .",
    "a more general form in which statistics may be available is when these represent the state covariance , or the output covariance , of a dynamical system driven by the stochastic process of interest .",
    "such a dynamical system may represent a model of physical processing ( bandpass filtering at sensor locations , losses , structure of sensor array , etc . ) or of virtual processing ( software - based ) of the original time - series . either way , covariance statistics represent ( generalized ) moments of the power spectrum and a theory which is completely analogous to the theory of the trigonometric moment problem is available and provides similar conclusions ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "in fact , the use of generalized statistics , which relates to beamspace processing , was explored in @xcite as a way to improve resolution in power spectral estimation over selected frequency bands .",
    "more recent work addresses spectral estimation with priors , computational issues , as well as important multivariate generalizations @xcite .",
    "the framework of the present work involves such moment problems specified by covariance statistics .",
    "invariably , moment statistics are estimated from a finite observation record and are known with limited accuracy .",
    "thus , in a typical experiment , as the observation record of a time - series increases so does the accuracy and the length of the estimated partial covariance sequence .",
    "our goal is to develop metrics that can be used to quantify spectral uncertainty .",
    "more specifically , phrased in the context of the trigonometric moment problem , we seek metrics between power spectra that have the following properties :    1 .   given a finite set of covariance samples , the family of consistent power spectra has a finite diameter , and 2 .",
    "the diameter of the uncertain set of power spectra shrinks to zero as both , the accuracy of the covariance samples increases and their number tends to infinity .",
    "the latter condition is dictated by the fact that the trigonometric moment problem is known to be determined , i.e. , there is a unique power spectrum which is consistent with an infinite sequence of covariances . as we will explain below ( in section  [ sec : main ] ) , the proper topology which allows for these properties to hold is the weak topology on measures ( cf . , @xcite ) .",
    "there is a variety of metrics that can be used to metrize this topology , and thus , in principle , to quantify spectral uncertainty .",
    "a contribution of this work is to suggest a class of metrics for which the radius of spectral uncertainty and _ a priori bounds _ are computable given a finite set of ( error - free ) statistics .    in section  [ sec : background ]",
    "we review the trigonometric moment problem and relevant concepts in functional analysis . in section  [ sec : main ] we define power - spectral uncertainty sets and discuss the relevance of weakly continuous metrics . in section [ sec : weakmetrics ] we present a collection of weakly continuous metrics that , in different ways , are suitable for metrizing the space of power spectra . in section [ thecaseof ]",
    "we compute the diameter of uncertainty sets , for a particular choice of a metric , and elaborate on the limit properties of this uncertainty quantification . in section [ sec : apps ]",
    "we present an example that elucidates the relevance and applicability of the results in practice . in section [ sec : generalized ] we explain how the framework applies in the context of generalized statistics . in section",
    "[ sec : threeex ] we highlight the use of this quantification of uncertainty in filter design we show how to tune a filter - bank so as limit spectral uncertainty over some frequency range of interest . in the concluding section ( section [ sec : conclutions ] )",

    "the covariances @xmath11 , @xmath12 , of a stationary random process @xmath13 are the fourier coefficients of the spectral measure @xmath3 as in .",
    "these are characterized by the non - negativity of the toeplitz matrices @xcite @xmath14,\\ ] ] for @xmath15 . when @xmath16 for @xmath17 and singular for @xmath18 , then it is also singular for all @xmath19 and @xmath20 for all @xmath21 . in this case",
    ", @xmath3 is singular with respect to the lebesgue measure and consists of finitely many `` spectral lines , '' equal in number to @xmath22 @xcite . because @xmath3 is a real measure , @xmath23 for @xmath24 ,",
    "hence we use only positive indices and refer by @xmath25 to the vector of the first @xmath26 moments , and by @xmath27 to the infinite sequence .",
    "the sequence @xmath28 is said to be _ positive _ if @xmath29 for all @xmath30 .",
    "similarly @xmath31 is said to be _ positive _ if @xmath32 .",
    "accordingly , the term _ non - negative _ is used when the relevant toeplitz matrices are non - negative definite .    as noted in the introduction , the power spectrum of a discrete - time stationary process is a bounded non - negative measure on the unit circle .",
    "the derivative ( of its absolutely continuous part ) is referred to as the spectral density function , while the singular part typically contains jumps ( spectral lines ) associated with the presence of sinusoidal components . in general , the singular part may have a more complicated mathematical structure that allocates `` energy '' on a set of measure zero without the need for distinct spectral lines @xcite . from a mathematical viewpoint",
    "such spectra are important as they represent limits of more palatable spectra , and hence , represent a form of completion .",
    "the natural topology where such limits ought to be considered is the so - called _ weak topology_. this topology is also known as the weak@xmath33 topology in functional analysis  a term which is less frequently used in the context of measures .",
    "the weak topology is defined in terms of convergence of linear functionals and is explained next .",
    "we denote by @xmath34 the class of real - valued continuous functions on @xmath35 .",
    "it is quite standard that the space of bounded linear functionals @xmath36 , can be identified with the space of bounded measures on @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "more specifically , any bounded functional @xmath37 can be represented in the form @xmath38 with @xmath3 being the corresponding measure  this is the riesz representation theorem .",
    "continuous functions now serve as `` test functions '' to differentiate between measures .",
    "bounds on the corresponding integrals define the weak topology : a sequence of measures @xmath39 , @xmath40 , converges to @xmath3 in the weak topology if @xmath41 for every @xmath42 .",
    "thus , for any two measures that are different , there exists a continuous function that the two measures integrate to different values . in this",
    "setting , a measure can be specified uniquely by its fourier coefficients .",
    "in fact , given a positive sequence @xmath28 , the unique corresponding measure @xmath3 can be determined as the limit in the weak topology of finite fourier sums or cesaro means @xcite .",
    "non - negative measures are naturally associated with analytic and harmonic functions  a connection which has been exploited in classical circuit theory in the context of passivity .",
    "herglotz theorem @xcite states that if @xmath3 is a bounded non - negative measure on @xmath35 , then @xmath43(z)=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi \\frac{e^{i\\theta}+z}{e^{i\\theta}-z}d\\mu(\\theta)\\ ] ] is analytic in @xmath44 and the real part is non - negative .",
    "such functions are referred to as either `` positive - real '' or , as carathodory functions .",
    "conversely , any positive - real function can be represented ( modulo an imaginary constant ) by the above formula for a suitable non - negative measure .",
    "the poisson integral of a non - negative measure @xmath3 @xmath45(z):=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi p_r(t-\\theta)d\\mu(\\theta ) , \\quad z = re^{it},\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the poisson kernel , is a harmonic function which is non - negative in @xmath47 and is equal to the real part of @xmath48(z)$ ] .",

    "thus , power spectra are , in a very precise sense , boundary limits of the ( harmonic ) real parts of positive - real functions .",
    "we postulate a situation where covariances @xmath31 are estimated from sample of a stochastic process @xmath55 with power spectrum @xmath56 , and where the estimation error in the entries of @xmath31 are bounded by @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the `` true '' spectrum @xmath56 belongs to the uncertainty set @xmath58 likewise , any choice for a `` nominal '' spectrum @xmath59 consistent with our assumptions will also belong to @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the distance between the two will be bounded by the diameter of the uncertainty set , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a suitable metric at hand .",
    "thus , our goal in this paper is to seek metrics @xmath62 on the space of positive measures @xmath7 that provide a meaningful and computationally tractable notion of a diameter for @xmath60 thereby quantifying modeling uncertainty in the spectral domain . to narrow down the search for suitable metrics , consider the scenario when the length of the data increases , and hence the accuracy as well as the number of covariance lags increases . in the limit ,",
    "as the estimation error goes to zero and the number @xmath30 of covariance lags goes to infinity , the uncertainty set shrinks to the singleton @xmath63 this is due to the fact that an infinite limit sequence @xmath28 defines a unique power spectrum ",
    "the trigonometric problem is determinate .",
    "the diameter should reflect this shrinkage to a singleton and tend to zero .",
    "for this to happen , the underlying metric needs to be weakly continuous as stated next .",
    "[ thm : weakstardistance ] let @xmath62 be a metric on @xmath7 .",

    ".    this can be seen by comparing the definition of @xmath65 with the definition of open sets in the weak topology .",
    "see the appendix for a detailed proof .",
    "occasionally one may have additional a priori knowledge on the structure and smoothness of the power spectrum which would further limit the uncertainty set .",
    "quantifying such `` structured '' uncertainty would necessarily be problem - specific and is not considered in the present work .",
    "instead , we take a viewpoint that allows comparing power spectra in a unified way , regardless smoothness , presence of spectral lines , or membership in a specific class of models .",
    "we now consider the case where the finite covariance sample @xmath31 is known exactly .",

    "the first one treats the case where the number of covariance lags goes to infinity , while the second , treats the case where the values of the covariance lags tend to those of a singular sequence . in both cases",

    "one such example is the metrics based on optimal transportation treated in @xcite , where the metrics have non - local properties such as geodesics which preserve lumpedness .",

    "optimal - transport geodesics may be used to model slow time - varying drift in the spectral power of non - stationary time - series @xcite  such models for non - stationarity lessen artifacts present when using ordinary interpolation ( e.g. , fade - in fade - out @xcite ) .",

    "this will be explored in the case where finitely many error - free covariances are known in sections [ thecaseof ] to [ sec : threeex ] .      a simple way to devise weakly continuous metrics which has a classical flavor is to first smoothing the measures via convolution with a fixed suitable continuous function , and then to compare the smoothed spectral densities .",
    "this echoes the use of windowing fourier techniques in the time domain @xcite where a suitable choice of a window is used to trade - off resolution and variance of the estimator .",
    "likewise here , the choice of a windowing function determines the resolution of the metric .",

    "we need a suitable modification to compare unequal masses .",

    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to study metrics suitable for assessing uncertainty of power spectra when these are based on finite second - order statistics . </S>",
    "<S> the family of power spectra which is consistent with a given range of values for the estimated statistics represents the _ uncertainty set _ about the `` true '' power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> our aim is to quantify the size of this uncertainty set using suitable notions of distance , and in particular , to compute the diameter of the set since this represents an upper bound on the distance between any choice of a nominal element in the set and the `` true '' power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> since the uncertainty set may contain power spectra with lines and discontinuities , it is natural to quantify distances in the weak topology  the topology defined by continuity of moments . </S>",
    "<S> we provide examples of such weakly - continuous metrics and focus on particular metrics for which we can explicitly quantify spectral uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider certain high resolution techniques which utilize filter - banks for pre - processing , and compute worst - case _ a priori _ uncertainty bounds solely on the basis of the filter dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this allows the _ a priori _ tuning of the filter - banks for improved resolution over selected frequency bands .    </S>",
