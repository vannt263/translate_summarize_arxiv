    "measurements of semileptonic @xmath0 meson decays are important in determining the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite elements @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which in turn provide an important constraint on the unitarity triangle @xcite that graphically represents the unitarity condition arising from the orthogonality relationship between the first and third columns of the ckm quark flavor - changing matrix .",
    "the ratio @xmath4 constrains the apex of the unitarity triangle in the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are two of the four the wolfenstein parameters which can represent the free parameters of the ckm matrix @xcite .",
    "a significantly non - zero value for @xmath7 implies a non - degenerate triangle with finite area .",
    "because the area of the triangle is proportional to the amount of @xmath8 violation in weak flavor - changing decays , measurements of @xmath7 help establish expectations for @xmath8 violation in @xmath0 decays in the standard model , and improved measurements can test the consistency of the ckm paradigm for @xmath8 violation in the standard model .",
    "in overconstraining the unitarity triangle with measurements of @xmath0 decays , @xmath1 and @xmath2 play an important role . as determinations of the height and base ,",
    "respectively , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are complementary to measurements of the ckm phases like @xmath9 , which are interior angles of the unitarity triangle .",
    "both side and angle measurements are needed .",
    "because semileptonic decays occur via a tree - level process , new physics contributions to the decay rate are insignificant , in contrast to a number of new physics scenarios which may contribute to the @xmath10 mixing phase .",
    "should discrepancies among the constraints on the unitarity triangle appear , it will be most useful to have constraints which are insensitive to new physics contributions .",
    "there are two major approaches to determine the ckm matrix element @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath12 decay rate is proportional to @xmath13 , so both techniques measure decay rates . in practice non - perturbative",
    "strong interaction effects limit the realized precision on @xmath2 .",
    "one approach is to focus on the exclusive decay mode @xmath14 , where heavy quark symmetry relations can be used to calculate the strong interaction form factor that enters the decay rate .",
    "a complementary approach takes advantage of a sum rule - like argument , comparing inclusive measurements summed over exclusive hadronic final states to calculations done at the quark level . in the inclusive measurements ,",
    "there are also non - perturbative qcd corrections , but again these may be controlled by taking advantage of heavy quark symmetry relations . besides the decay rate , other observables can be used to test our understanding of the qcd corrections . because the understanding of non - perturbative qcd limits the precision of @xmath2 determination , it is crucial to compare results obtained using exclusive and inclusive techniques , which each rely on those corrections but in different ways .      in studying the exclusive decay @xmath14 in the framework of heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )  @xcite ,",
    "it is useful to consider the kinematic variable @xmath15 , which is linearly related to @xmath16 , the mass of the virtual @xmath17 .",
    "because both the @xmath18 and @xmath19 quarks are heavy compared to the scale of qcd interactions , the non - relativistic scalar product of 4-velocities replaces @xmath16 as the relevant invariant in the limit @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    the differential decay rate for @xmath14",
    "is given by @xmath22 ^ 2 } { { \\cal k}(w)},\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is a kinematic function of masses and @xmath24 that depends only on the @xmath25 nature of the weak transitions , and @xmath26 represents the form factor describing the strong dynamics of the @xmath27 transition @xcite .",
    "hqet provides a normalization for the form factor at @xmath28 , the kinematic point where the @xmath19 quark does not recoil in the parent @xmath0 meson rest frame . in the infinite mass limit ,",
    "the form factor is unity because the light degrees of freedom in the meson still see the same heavy source of color field unmoving in the meson rest frame .",
    "corrections to the heavy quark symmetry limit occur first at order @xmath29 @xcite ; lattice qcd @xcite and qcd sum rules @xcite give comparable values of @xmath30 at about @xmath31 .",
    "the shape of the form factor is less determined .",
    "the most general lorentz invariant form factor is simplified by heavy quark symmetry relations and consideration of only the nearly massless leptons @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "qcd dispersion relations may be used to constrain the shape @xcite .",
    "experimentally one measures the decay rate as a function of @xmath24 and extrapolates to @xmath28 to measure @xmath34 .    using this technique cleo",
    "has recently measured @xmath2 using @xmath35 and @xmath36 decays in a sample of @xmath37 @xmath38 events collected in @xmath39 collisions just above threshold at the @xmath40 @xcite . candidate @xmath41",
    "s are reconstructed in the decay chains @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "candidates are paired with electron or muon candidates , and the yield of @xmath45 events is obtained using a maximum likelihood fit to the @xmath46 distribution , which allows kinematic separation of signal and background .",
    "the angle between the @xmath0 and @xmath47 candidate may be reconstructed kinematically from 4-momentum conservation and the assumption that the missing 4-momentum is consistent with a neutrino : @xmath48 due to additional missing particles , the physics background @xmath49 can populate the unphysical regions in @xmath46 while signal events will peak in the interval @xmath50 . in the fit",
    "other backgrounds are determined from data ( e.g.  mass sidebands ) and monte carlo simulation .",
    "we fit in 10 @xmath24 bins ; representative fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ kme.fig.cosby ] .",
    "[ kme.fig.cosby ]    given the @xmath45 yields in 10 @xmath24 bins , we extract @xmath34 and a form - factor slope parameter @xmath51 using a @xmath52 fit ( fig .",
    "[ kme.fig.dslnu ] ) .",
    "the best fit parameters are @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic respectively .",
    "using @xmath55 this gives @xmath56 .",
    "this value is somewhat larger than that found by experiments at lep , and a global fit taking into account correlations between experiments has only a 5% confidence level @xcite .",
    "cleo is the only experiment that fits the data simultaneously for the poorly known @xmath57 backgrounds , finding a smaller contribution than that used by the lep experiments .",
    "a @xmath58 fluctuation in this background would account for the difference between lep and cleo results .      the complementary approach to determine @xmath2 measures the inclusive semileptonic decay rate , which is proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "again , heavy quark symmetry allows control of strong interaction effects . within the framework of hqet the non - perturbative effects",
    "are handled using an operator product expansion ( ope ) in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass @xmath59 .",
    "hqet defines parameters @xmath60 , and @xmath61 that are matrix elements of non - perturbative operators .",
    "observables like the semileptonic decay width and moments of inclusive decay spectra are expressed in terms of these parameters , as well as phase space factors and the coupling @xmath2 we wish to determine .",
    "the degree to which we can constrain the hqet parameters determines the uncertainty of the @xmath2 determination from the measurement of the decay width .",
    "there are simple physical interpretations of the lowest order hqet parameters .",
    "one may think of @xmath62 as the difference between the @xmath0 meson mass and the @xmath18 quark mass , expressing the energy of the light degrees of freedom in the meson .",
    "the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath61 enter the expansion at @xmath64 and are the kinetic energy of the @xmath18 quark in the @xmath0 meson and the hyperfine interaction of the @xmath18 spin with the light degrees of freedom , respectively . the latter is determined from the @xmath0@xmath65 mass splitting to be @xmath66 gev@xmath67 .",
    "recently the cleo collaboration has measured the moments of the photon energy spectrum in @xmath68 @xcite and the first and second moments of the inclusive hadronic recoil mass @xcite and lepton energy spectrum @xcite in semileptonic decays .",
    "these spectral measurements can be compared to calculations to limit uncertainties on the hqet parameters , giving increased precision in the inclusive determination of @xmath2 .      at the parton level ,",
    "the signal is the decay of a heavy quark to two ( nearly ) massless daughters .",
    "the spectrum is therefore expected to peak at @xmath69 , with doppler broadening due to the motion of the @xmath18 quark in the @xmath0 meson ( easily related to @xmath63 ) and of the @xmath0 meson in the lab frame .",
    "gluon radiation ( or equivalently the production of hadronic states containing an @xmath70 quark ) also broaden the expected narrow peak .",
    "the signal is thus distinguished by a high energy ( 22.5 gev ) photon recoiling against a strange hadronic system . in @xmath39 production of @xmath0 s , there are also substantial backgrounds from continuum production ( @xmath71 ) of @xmath72 s and initial state radiation ( @xmath73 ) .    using a sample of 9.1 fb@xmath74 ( about @xmath75 @xmath76 events ) , cleo measures the inclusive photon spectrum on the @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "large backgrounds from @xmath77 events are suppressed using event shape variables and signatures of @xmath0 meson decays , either a lepton tag or a reconstructed @xmath78 final state .",
    "the remaining backgrounds from @xmath77 are subtracted using a sizeable sample ( 4.4 fb@xmath74 ) of events below @xmath76 threshold .",
    "what remains includes backgrounds from @xmath0 decays that are not @xmath68 , substantially from production of high momentum @xmath72 s and @xmath6 s .",
    "monte carlo is used to subtract the @xmath76 backgrounds which escape a @xmath72 and @xmath6 veto .",
    "the monte carlo is normalized to the observed yield of high momentum @xmath72 s and @xmath6 s in the same data sample .",
    "we obtain the first and second moments of the @xmath68 photon spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ kme.fig.b2sgamma ] ) : @xmath79 gev and @xmath80 gev@xmath67 , where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic , respectively . from the first moment and",
    "the theoretical expression @xcite we extract @xmath81 gev . here",
    "the uncertainties are experimental and theoretical , with a leading contribution from the variation of the unknown parameters that enter at @xmath82 in the operator produce expansion .",
    "the hadronic invariant mass spectrum in inclusive @xmath83 also gives information about the hqet parameters .",
    "cleo measures the recoil mass spectrum @xcite by taking advantage of a hermetic detector ( 95% of the solid angle ) to infer the neutrino 4-vector from missing energy and momentum measurements .",
    "the recoil mass is given exactly by latexmath:[$m_x^2=m_b^2 +   m_{\\ell\\nu}^2 - 2e_be_{\\ell\\nu } + 2    uncalculable when the @xmath0 direction is unknown and is therefore ignored .",
    "we measure @xmath85 for events with a lepton energy of at least 1.5 gev .",
    "the hadronic invariant mass moments may be measured directly from the moments of the smeared @xmath86 distribution ( fig .",
    "[ kme.fig.moments ] ) after correcting for a small bias measured using a detailed monte carlo .",
    "alternatively , consistent values are obtained by fitting @xmath86 to components from @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , where @xmath90 represents resonant @xmath91 and non - resonant @xmath92 final states .",
    "the moments are insensitive to the composition of the @xmath90 states used in the fit .",
    "we find @xmath93 gev@xmath67 and @xmath94 gev@xmath95 . here",
    "the moments are taken with respect to the spin - averaged @xmath96 meson mass .",
    "combined with theoretical expressions for the first hadronic mass moment , the measurement provides the constraint on the hqet parameters @xmath97 and @xmath63 shown in fig .  [ kme.fig.moments ] . in combination with the constraint from the first moment of the @xmath68 photon spectrum , we determine @xmath98 gev@xmath67 , where the uncertainties are experimental and theoretical ( @xmath99 ) . these values for the hqet parameters",
    "may be combined with the theoretical expression for the semileptonic decay width and compared to measurements of the width from the @xmath100 branching fraction from cleo @xmath101)% @xcite and the @xmath0 lifetime @xcite to determine @xmath102 . here",
    "the uncertainties are due to @xmath103 , the measurement of the semileptonic width , and theory , respectively .",
    "this is a 3.2% measurement of @xmath2 extracted assuming the validity of parton - hadron duality .",
    "finally because two hqet parameters have been extracted using two experimental measurements , it is extremely interesting to add additional constraints to test consistency .",
    "cleo has recently measured moments of the lepton energy spectrum ( @xmath104 gev ) in semileptonic @xmath0 decays @xcite . again",
    "a comparison to theory calculations @xcite allows determination of hqet parameters .",
    "cleo measures the inclusive electron and muon spectra above 1.5 gev , subtracting backgrounds using data and monte carlo .",
    "backgrounds from @xmath71 are subtracted using data below the @xmath40 .",
    "backgrounds from @xmath105 are vetoed , and monte carlo simulation is used to subtract a contribution that fails the veto cuts .",
    "leptons from @xmath106 and @xmath107 are also removed using simulation .",
    "the subtracted spectrum is corrected for efficiency , detector and final state radiation and the motion of the @xmath0 in the lab frame .",
    "figure  [ kme.fig.elep ] shows the spectrum for electrons and muons .",
    "we compute the generalized moments @xmath108 and compare to theoretical calculations to constrain @xmath63 and @xmath62 .",
    "we find @xmath109 and @xmath110 gev , where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic .",
    "the values of the hqet parameters are @xmath111 and @xmath112 , consistent with those obtained using moments of photon energy in @xmath68 and hadronic mass in @xmath12 .",
    "constraints from all cleo moment measurements are shown in fig .",
    "[ kme.fig.elep ] .",
    "the central values for all constraints are plotted .",
    "they all intersect near a common point with the exception of the second moment of the @xmath68 photon spectrum , which is shown with a 1 @xmath113 band of the total uncertainty .",
    "this degree of agreement gives some confidence in the inclusive technique for determination of @xmath2 .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties due to unknown @xmath82 parameters are large and may potentially limit the precision . in principle",
    ", these may be self - consistently extracted from data given additional observables .",
    "two techniques have been used to measure @xmath2 in semileptonic @xmath0 decays .",
    "the exclusive measurement @xmath14 gives an uncertainty below 7% , with a central value from cleo which is larger than that obtained in the more precise ( 3.2% ) inclusive measurement of @xmath12 .",
    "the level of consistency for the cleo exclusive and inclusive results is only at the 2 @xmath113 level .",
    "the world average for the exclusive @xmath2 measurement is in very good agreement with the inclusive result .",
    "there is room for improvement in future measurements using the large data samples at the @xmath0 factories .",
    "the exclusive measurement relies on extrapolation to @xmath28 .",
    "better experimental knowledge of the @xmath27 form factor will improve that extrapolation .",
    "reliance on hqet for form factor relations can be tested by measuring the form factor ratios @xmath114 and @xmath115 and checking symmetry relations with @xmath116 .",
    "better understanding of backgrounds from @xmath117 will hopefully resolve the 5% c.l . in combining lep and cleo results .",
    "the exclusive measurement is also limited by the theoretical uncertainty in @xmath30 , which can be reduced in principle by unquenched lattice qcd calculations .",
    "the inclusive measurement can be improved with better measurements of the semileptonic width and the hqet parameters @xmath63 and @xmath62 ; statistical improvements , particularly for @xmath68 , will be possible at the @xmath0 factories .",
    "the leading uncertainty comes from the @xmath99 terms in the ope .",
    "additional studies of inclusive decay spectra and better phenomenological understanding of the third order parameters will lead to greater confidence in the inclusive extraction of @xmath2 .",
    "the main experimental difficulty in the determination of @xmath1 is suppression of the hundred - fold larger background from @xmath12 .",
    "two general approaches may be used to suppress the background . in one method , full reconstruction of exclusive final states ( including the neutrino ! )",
    "gives suppression .",
    "in inclusive techniques one makes kinematic cuts to enhance the @xmath118 signal over the @xmath12 background .",
    "a cut on the lepton energy above the endpoint for @xmath12 is a well - known and exploited kinematic cut . in both approaches",
    "the limitations from non - perturbative qcd are significant . for exclusive",
    "decays the limitation enters as poorly known , difficult- to - estimate form factors . in the inclusive approach",
    "the kinematic cuts introduce dependence on the non - perturbative parameters describing motion of the @xmath18 quark inside the @xmath0 meson and/or model dependence due to unknown distribution of decays in the kinematic variables . like @xmath2 measurements , because the main obstacles to interpretation are non - perturbative qcd parameters , it is important to use complementary techniques to assess the limits of our understanding .      by `` reconstructing '' the neutrino 4-momentum using missing energy and momentum in a hermetic detector ,",
    "cleo observed the exclusive decays @xmath119 and @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "the `` neutrino reconstruction '' technique defines the missing energy @xmath121 and missing momentum @xmath122 , assuming all daughters of the @xmath0 decays apart from the neutrino are reconstructed . with the neutrino energy and momentum one reconstructs invariant mass and energy for each candidate ; peaks in @xmath0 candidate mass and @xmath123 are expected for signal events .",
    "cleo uses isospin symmetry to combine charged and neutral modes in the @xmath124 and @xmath5 channels .",
    "( @xmath125 and @xmath126 ) from the observed events the branching fraction is measured : @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "a second analysis @xcite is sensitive mainly to high momentum leptons ( @xmath129 gev ) and thus measured only @xmath130 , which has the harder lepton spectrum .",
    "the result , which is statistically independent from that in 1996 , is @xmath131 . in both analyses",
    "@xmath1 is inferred from the decay rate @xmath132 .",
    "the proportionality constant @xmath133 depends on kinematic factors and the decay form factors which are taken from lattice qcd , quark models ( e.g. isgw2 ) , or light cone sum rules .",
    "combining both 1996 and 2000 cleo results gives @xmath134 , where the uncertainties are statistical , systematic , and theoretical , mainly due to normalization of the form factors and partly due to the form factor shape .",
    "since the time of this conference , cleo presented preliminary results from an update of the 1996 analysis with increased statistics @xcite . in the new analysis",
    "we are able to bin in @xmath16 and reduce the systematic uncertainty from the form factor shape .",
    "inclusive measurements of @xmath1 achieve the suppression of the @xmath12 background by selecting a region of phase space where the background is suppressed .",
    "a simple cut on lepton energy above the @xmath12 endpoint ( @xmath135 gev ) separates signal and background , but with a cost : the fraction of the @xmath118 spectrum measured is only 10% .",
    "this is important for two reasons .",
    "one would like the measurement to be as inclusive as possible to invoke parton - hadron duality , and one needs to know the efficiency of the cut precisely to extract @xmath1 from the partial branching fraction .",
    "other kinematic cuts are sensitive to more of the spectrum ( @xmath136 gev@xmath67 is about 20% and @xmath137 is about 70% ) , but these are more difficult due to experimental resolution .",
    "the cut on lepton energy introduces another complication . because the cut is near the endpoint , the fraction of events passing the cut is sensitive to doppler broadening due to the motion of the @xmath18 quark in the @xmath0 meson , or in other words , the non - perturbative strong physics of the hadronic bound state .",
    "it was suggested by a number of authors that the @xmath68 photon spectrum , which is sensitive to the same non - perturbative physics , can be used to measure this effect @xcite . because the decays both involve heavy to light particle transitions , the same non - perturbative qcd effects smear both spectra , and the light cone shape functions are the same to leading order .",
    "cleo has recently measured the @xmath68 photon spectrum ( sec .",
    "[ kme.sec.bsgamma ] ) and remeasured the lepton spectrum in @xmath0 decays above 2.2 gev @xcite .",
    "combined these analyses give a 15% measurement of @xmath1 .",
    "the lepton spectrum is measured above 1.5 gev , and the region between 1.5 and 2.2 gev is fit to control the @xmath138 backgrounds in the 2.22.6 gev signal region .",
    "background from leptons in @xmath71 events ( which tend to be more jet - like than @xmath76 events at threshold ) is suppressed using event shape variables , and the remaining background is subtracted using data below the @xmath40 .",
    "other backgrounds ( e.g.  from @xmath139 ) are subtracted using monte carlo .",
    "the yields of leptons from various sources are shown in table  [ kme.tab.endpoint ] .",
    "the partial branching fraction @xmath141 for @xmath142 is converted to a branching fraction without a lepton energy cut by dividing by the efficiency @xmath143 for the lepton energy cut .",
    "the efficiency is determined to be @xmath144 from analysis of the @xmath68 photon energy spectrum .",
    "then @xmath1 is determined from the theory calculations for the decay rate in terms of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath145 , where the uncertainties are due to uncertainties on the endpoint rate , the determination of @xmath143 , theoretical uncertainties in the expression for the decay rate in terms of @xmath1 , and unknown higher order corrections to the shape function that differ between @xmath118 and @xmath68 .",
    "it is appropriate to make two comments on the theoretical status of the @xmath1 measurement from the lepton energy endpoint rate and @xmath68 photon spectrum . since the cleo publication",
    ", there have been a number of theoretical investigations of the effects of sub - leading shape functions on the determination of @xmath143 using the @xmath68 photon spectrum @xcite .",
    "the correspondence between the shape functions for @xmath118 and @xmath68 is exact only at leading order in the twist expansion .",
    "the effects of higher twist terms were investigated and although they lead to a reduction in the value of @xmath143 obtained from the @xmath68 spectrum ( and therefore an increase in the extracted @xmath1 of order 10% ) , the resulting uncertainties on @xmath1 are safely below the 10% level .",
    "a second concern is the effect of non - factorizable terms that may lead to light flavor - dependent contributions to @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "the so - called weak - annihilation term contributes at large @xmath16 and may have significant impact in the lepton energy endpoint region .",
    "the size of the contribution is not known presently , but the difference in endpoint rates or spectra for @xmath147 and @xmath148 decays would help clarify things in the future .",
    "we find good agreement between measurements of @xmath1 using inclusive and exclusive techniques .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty on the form factor normalization currently limits the precision of the exclusive @xmath1 measurement . in the future",
    ", unquenched lattice qcd calculations can provide a form factor in a limited region of @xmath16 and experiments will have the statistics to bin in @xmath16 to extract the rate in this region .",
    "the inclusive @xmath118 measurement can be further improved with increased @xmath68 statistics , and better phenomenological understanding of non - perturbative shape functions for the @xmath0 meson .",
    "comparison between inclusive measurements that use different kinematic cuts ( more inclusive and away from the endpoint region ) will increase our confidence in inclusive @xmath1 measurements .",
    "since the principal background comes from @xmath12 , better knowledge of the dominant semileptonic @xmath0 decays will improve systematic errors for both inclusive and exclusive measurements .",
