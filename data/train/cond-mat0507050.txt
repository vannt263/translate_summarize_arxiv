    "a bose condensed system in a random environment is a very important problem not only on the interests in the impurity effect but also for clarifying the long - range correlation , for example , the relation between bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) and superfluidity .",
    "experimental works have studied this system by means of liquid 4 in porous glass and observed many interesting phenomena @xcite .",
    "in particular , yamamoto _ et al .",
    "_ recently observed the disappearance of superfluidity of liquid 4 confined in porous geltech silica with the very small pore size 25  at high pressures and very low temperatures , suggesting the new quantum phase transition to localized bec under the effect of strong correlation @xcite .    in this work , motivated by their experiment",
    ", we investigate the behavior of a bose fluid under the effect of confinement at zero temperature .",
    "we use the three - dimensional bose fluid model in a confined potential @xcite , and introduce our new criterion for finding the localization of bec .",
    "supposing a bec is localized , we calculate the energy of the system as a function of the size of the localized bec , and minimize the energy . the resulting size becomes the order of the scale of confinement above a critical pressure , when the superfluid density disappears .",
    "the critical pressure is quantitatively consistent with the experimental one without free parameters .",
    "the grand canonical hamiltonian @xmath0 of a bose fluid in a confined potential is given by    @xmath1\\hat{a}^\\dagger(\\vec{k})\\hat{a}(\\vec{k})+\\frac{1}{v}\\sum_{\\vec{k}_1 , \\vec{k}_2}u(\\vec{k}_1-\\vec{k}_2)\\hat{a}^\\dagger(\\vec{k}_1)\\hat{a}(\\vec{k}_2)+\\frac{1}{2v}\\sum_{\\vec{k}_1 , \\vec{k}_2 , \\vec{q}}g_0(\\vec{q})\\hat{a}^\\dagger(\\vec{k}_1+\\vec{q})\\hat{a}^\\dagger(\\vec{k}_2-\\vec{q})\\hat{a}(\\vec{k}_2)\\hat{a}(\\vec{k}_1 ) , \\label{eq - hamiltonian}\\ ] ]    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the free boson creation and annihilation operators with the wave number @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the kinetic energy of a particle of mass @xmath6 , @xmath7 the chemical potential .",
    "@xmath8 is the external confined potential , @xmath9 the volume of the system having the size @xmath10 and @xmath11 the interaction between two particles .",
    "the second term of the right - hand side represents the interaction between one particle and the confined potential ; the second - order perturbation yields the green function @xmath12 the third term refers to the interparticle interaction . using the ring - approximation , we obtain @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the noninteracting green function @xmath15},\\label{eq - green - function-0}\\ ] ] with the frequency @xmath16 and @xmath17 . following the bogoliubov method , we separate @xmath3 to the condensed part @xmath18 with the smallest wave number @xmath19 , and the noncondensed part @xmath20 .",
    "then we calculate the green function @xmath21 including interparticle interaction @xmath22 by the bogoliubov theory , finally obtaining the total green function @xmath23 .",
    "superfluid component @xmath24 based on the two fluid model can be given by the linear response theory @xcite @xmath25,\\label{eq - superfluid - density}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the total number of the particles .",
    "we assume the gaussian confinement @xmath27 $ ] so that the wave number @xmath28 can be connected with the pore size @xmath29 of porous glass . here",
    "the strength @xmath30 is estimated from the experimental critical coverage below which superfluidity vanishes @xcite .",
    "for the interparticle interaction , we use @xmath31 $ ] , where parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 are determined by the comparison with the potential proposed by aziz _",
    "_ @xcite .    to consider the phase of localized bec",
    ", we introduce a new criterion .",
    "first we assume a localized bec of the size @xmath34 and calculate the energy @xmath35 by replacing the volume @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ eq - hamiltonian ] ) with @xmath37 .",
    "the total energy of the volume @xmath36 should be proportional to @xmath38 , because the number of the localized becs is proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "the ideal or weakly interacting bose gas has @xmath35 proportional to @xmath40 . in the strongly correlated bose fluid , however , @xmath35 is no longer a simple linear function of @xmath40 , then @xmath41 depends on @xmath40 . calculating @xmath41 as a function of @xmath40 , we find @xmath42 which minimizes @xmath41 .",
    "the localization of bec can be defined by the new criterion .",
    "if @xmath43 exceeds @xmath36 , the system is a non - localized bec state .",
    "when @xmath43 is reduced to become comparable to @xmath44 , we judge that the bec is localized .",
    "since @xmath43 is a function of @xmath26 and the pressure @xmath45 , we can obtain the phase boundary of the transition to localization of bec by this criterion .",
    "figure [ fig - localbec ] shows the dependence of @xmath24 and @xmath43 on the pressure , where all numerical parameters are fixed from reference @xcite and remain no free parameters . at the pressure @xmath46 mpa ,",
    "superfluid component @xmath24 disappears and @xmath43 is reduced dramatically to the order of @xmath44 .",
    "we can , therefore , define this pressure as the critical pressure @xmath47 .",
    "dependence of the superfluid component @xmath24 and the volume @xmath43 of the localized bec on the pressure .",
    "the pressure @xmath45 can be obtained by the thermodynamic relation @xmath48 . ]    our critical pressure @xmath49 mpa is quantitatively consistent with the experimental one @xmath50 mpa @xcite and we also conclude that experimental disappearance of superfluidity at high pressures is caused by the transition to localization of bec . for the case of porous glass of the larger pore size @xmath51  , we obtain the much larger critical pressure @xmath52 mpa which is too high for a bec to be localized against solidification of liquid 4 , which is also consistent with experimental result for vycor glass @xcite .",
