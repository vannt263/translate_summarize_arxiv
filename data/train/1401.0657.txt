    "controlling the states of quantum particles is a challenging task and a topic of significant present activity in the fields of atom optics , quantum computation , quantum metrology , and quantum simulation of condensed matter systems @xcite . in particular , the generation of angular momentum for matter waves is attracting a lot of attention as , for instance , in studying superfluid properties of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite .",
    "these condensates can sustain vortices , which have been envisioned to be used in applications for interferometry , as for example gyroscopy with counter - rotating vortex superpositions @xcite , quantum information , such as coherent superpositions of arbitrary winding numbers @xcite or entangled vortex states @xcite , and as a way to study the behavior of random polynomial roots @xcite .",
    "different techniques have been proposed and experimentally reported to generate angular momentum with single atoms and becs , such as stirring with a laser beam @xcite , phase imprinting @xcite , transfer of orbital angular momentum from optical states @xcite , rotating traps @xcite , turbulence @xcite , dynamical instabilities @xcite or merging multiple trapped becs @xcite .    at the same time , adiabatic techniques to control the external degrees of freedom of massive particles have been developed @xcite , based on the spatial analogue of the stimulated raman adiabatic passage technique @xcite . for the centre - of - mass degree of freedom , this is usually realized by considering a triple well configuration and assuming that only a single state in each trap contributes to the dynamics . up to now , all proposals in which the spatial adiabatic passage technique has been discussed have been effectively one - dimensional ( 1d ) : the traps are arranged in a linear geometry and a single particle in one of the outer traps is coherently transferred to the other outermost trap with very high fidelity .",
    "significant work has been done for this process by discussing efficiency and robustness for single atoms @xcite , electrons @xcite , atomic vortices @xcite , holes @xcite and becs @xcite .",
    "proposals for spatial adiabatic passage for cold atoms propagating in systems of three coupled waveguides have also been discussed using effective 1d models @xcite .",
    "recently , spatial adiabatic passage for light propagating in a system of three coupled optical waveguides @xcite has been experimentally reported .    in this work ,",
    "we go beyond those well understood 1d spatial adiabatic passage systems and focus onto the possibilities offered by their extension to two dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "the inclusion of this new degree of freedom allows considering novel scenarios in which all traps can be tunnel - coupled simultaneously .",
    "contrarily to the well - discussed one - dimensional models for spatial adiabatic passage , the two - dimensional scenario has no fully equivalent model in quantum optics , where the stirap technique involves only two laser couplings of adjacent transitions of a three - level atomic system .",
    "furthermore , understanding the fundamentals of 2d spatial adiabatic passage opens the possibility to study physical scenarios that require a full 2d description , such as the implementation of new interferometric schemes @xcite , which take advantage of the existing level crossings , or the generation of angular momentum carrying states .",
    "angular momentum is an inherent 2d quantity , which can only be created in systems in which rotational symmetry is broken .",
    "we demonstrate that , by applying a spatial adiabatic passage sequence in a system of three traps with broken spatial symmetry , a single particle can be completely transferred from the ground vibrational state of the initial trap to the two degenerate first excited states of the final trap . depending on the total time of the process , this can generate angular momentum with values oscillating between @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the process is robust since both , the complete transfer and the generation of angular momentum , occur within a broad range of parameter values .",
    "we model the generation of angular momentum by using the asymptotic states of the individual traps and the results are confirmed with a numerical integration of the full 2d schrdinger equation .",
    "note that such a two - dimensional process constitutes an alternative method to standard techniques for the generation of angular momentum in ultracold atoms @xcite .",
    "and @xmath1 have a trapping frequency @xmath2 and trap @xmath3 has a trapping frequency @xmath4 . ]",
    "we consider a system consisting of three 2d harmonic potentials ( labeled @xmath5 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where initially a single particle is located in the vibrational ground state of trap @xmath5 .",
    "the trapping frequencies of @xmath5 and @xmath1 are equal ( @xmath6 ) and the one for @xmath3 is half that value ( @xmath7 ) , so that a resonance exists between the ground levels of traps @xmath5 and @xmath1 and the first excited level of trap @xmath3 . since the first excited energy level of trap @xmath3 is double degenerate , it supports an angular momentum carrying state through a superposition of the two energy eigenstates @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the chosen @xmath10@xmath11 reference frame .",
    "in particular , maximum angular momentum , @xmath12 , occurs when the two degenerate states are ( i ) equally populated and ( ii ) have a phase difference of @xmath13 , i.e. : @xmath14 .",
    "\\label{max}\\ ] ] here the @xmath15 are the eigenfunctions of the first excited states of the @xmath3 trap in polar coordinates , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 being the principal quantum number and the @xmath18 component of the angular momentum , respectively .",
    "the first thing to note is that an effective 1d configuration in which all traps are arranged in a straight line along the @xmath10 axis can only lead to population transfer to the state @xmath19 and not to the generation of angular momentum . to populate both of the degenerate states it is necessary to break the symmetry of the linear configuration and here we do this by considering geometries in which the @xmath5 trap is rotated around the @xmath1 trap and forms an angle @xmath20 with respect to the @xmath10 axis , as can be seen in fig .",
    "the positions of the trap centers are @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the distances between the @xmath5 and @xmath1 and the @xmath1 and @xmath3 traps , respectively . in the @xmath10@xmath11 reference frame",
    ", the ground states in the @xmath5 and @xmath1 traps can be expressed as @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively . for the @xmath3 trap with @xmath4",
    "we consider the eigenfunctions @xmath30 and @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 are the single - particle eigenfunctions for the @xmath16-th vibrational state of the 1d quantum harmonic oscillator with trapping frequency @xmath33 .",
    "the breaking of symmetry introduces two new effects with respect to effective 1d configurations : ( i ) the traps @xmath5 and @xmath3 can get close enough to allow direct tunnel coupling and ( ii ) there is no longer a preferred direction along which one of the states in @xmath3 can line up . thus , since the position of the @xmath5 trap with respect to the @xmath3 trap forms an angle @xmath34 with the @xmath10 axis , there is a population transfer between the state @xmath35 and @xmath36 with coupling rate @xmath37 , but also between @xmath35 and @xmath38 with coupling rate @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , both first excited states of the @xmath3 trap become involved in the dynamics of the system , which in the basis @xmath40 can be described by the @xmath41 hamiltonian @xmath42 the coupling rates depend on the trap separation and can be calculated analytically due to the harmonicity of the potentials @xcite . additionally , the coupling rates between the ground state in @xmath5 and the first excited states in @xmath3 depend on the angle @xmath34 as @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the coupling rate between the ground state of a trap with trapping frequency @xmath2 and a resonant first excited state of a trap with trapping frequency @xmath4 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that hamiltonian ( 2 ) possesses four non - degenerate eigenvalues , except for @xmath46 when two of them become degenerate .",
    "the generation of angular momentum occurs along with the transfer of the particle from the @xmath5 to the @xmath3 trap through a spatial adiabatic passage process @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a counterintuitive temporal sequence of the couplings , i.e. with the particle initially located in @xmath5 and the position of @xmath1 being fixed , the approach and separation sequence of the @xmath3 trap towards the @xmath1 trap along the @xmath10 axis is initiated a time @xmath47 before the @xmath5 trap approaches and separates from the @xmath1 trap , keeping the angle @xmath20 constant . in the following , we will analyze this process in terms of the overall energy eigenvalues and eigenstates of the system by diagonalizing the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "[ fig3 ] , at the end of the process the eigenstates @xmath51 and @xmath52 only involve the asymptotic states of the @xmath3 trap : @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 .",
    "this means that by following the two eigenstates @xmath51 and @xmath52 , a complete transfer of population from the initial trap @xmath5 to the final trap @xmath3 is achieved .",

    "thus , the process is very robust and highly versatile .",
    "let us finally briefly comment on a possible implementation of the above scheme using current technology .",
    "optical microtraps , where atoms are trapped in the focal point of a red - detuned laser beam , can be used to create versatile potentials for single atoms and the presented triple well system can , for example , be build using holographic techniques with programmable spatial light modulators @xcite .",

    "in conclusion , we have extended the spatial adiabatic passage technique to the 2d case , demonstrating that angular momentum can be successfully generated by breaking the symmetry of the coupling sequence in a system of three harmonic traps of different trapping frequencies . starting with a single particle in the ground state of a harmonic trap with frequency @xmath2",
    ", it can be fully transferred to the degenerate first excited states of a final harmonic trap of frequency @xmath4 by following adiabatically a superposition of two energy eigenstates of the system .",
