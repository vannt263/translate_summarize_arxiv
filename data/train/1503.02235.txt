    ", we discuss other possibilities . finally , we present our conclusions in section 6 . throughout this letter , we adopt the cosmological parameters @xmath16 = 0.7 , @xmath17= 0.3 , and @xmath18 .",
    "the sdss legacy survey provides a database of quasar samples that includes photometries in _ u , g , r , i _ , and _ z _ bands and spectra from 3800 to 9200 @xmath19 with resolutions of about 2000 @xcite . in the sdss dr7 quasar catalog , @xcite compiled 105,783 quasars that are more luminous than @xmath20 and have at least one emission line with fwhm larger than 1000 km s@xmath21 or have interesting / complex absorption features .",
    "this catalog provides the basic database for our study .",
    "accompanying the dr7 quasar catalog , there are other value - added catalogs .",
    "@xcite recalculated the redshift of quasars and reduced the systematic effects of the redshift to the level of 30 km s@xmath21 per unit redshift .",
    "@xcite improved the sky subtraction in the red wavelength band .",
    "after measuring the spectroscopic features , @xcite calculated the implied physical parameters ( e.g. , the bolometric luminosity , black hole mass , and eddington ratio ) for each quasar .    in this study , we take the spectra from @xcite and use the improved redshifts from @xcite .",
    "we exclude the quasars with broad absorption lines from our analysis according to the flags in @xcite .",
    "the radio - loud quasars show significant redder continua than radio - quiet ones @xcite and the fraction of them changes with both redshift and luminosity @xcite . for these reasons",
    ", we also remove them .",
    "therefore , our final sample with calculated bolometric luminosity includes 91,131 objects .",
    "we first correct the galactic reddening for each quasar using the sfd map @xcite and the reddening curve of @xcite .",
    "then , we mask bad pixels and shift the spectra to their rest frame according to the redshifts of @xcite .",
    "next , we follow @xcite to make the quasar composite and calculate the statistical error for the composite spectrum by dividing 68@xmath22 semi - quantile to the square of the contributing number at each wavelength .    the composite spectrum of all 91,131 quasars is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] as the blue line . for comparison ,",
    "the composite spectrum of @xcite is shown as the red line .",
    "as can be seen , these two composites show good consistency .",
    "because of a much larger sample size , our composite spectrum has a much higher signal - to - noise ratio ( shown in the sub - panel of fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .    in the uv - opt band",
    ", the quasar continuum can be very nicely characterized by a single power law ( @xmath11 ) and is usually fitted from continuum windows . in @xcite ,",
    "two continuum windows , 1350 - 1365 @xmath19 and 4200 - 4230 @xmath19 , have been adopted , which avoid the @xmath23 line at shorter wavelengths and contamination from the host galaxy at longer wavelengths . however , this range is too long to be covered by any single sdss spectrum at any given redshift .",
    "similar to @xcite , we add a new continuum window 2210 - 2230 @xmath19 . with this configuration of continuum windows and the 3800 - 9200 @xmath19 wavelength range of sdss quasars , the far - uv slope @xmath0 and the near - uv slope @xmath2 can be fitted for quasars in the redshift intervals @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , respectively .",
    "we bin the quasars into four bolometric luminosity ( @xmath28 ) bins with a bin size of 1 dex from @xmath29 to @xmath30 and then make composites respectively . to show the possible variance of the composites more clearly , each composite spectrum",
    "is further divided by the global composite spectrum ( blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and normalized at 3000 @xmath19 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    the quasar composite spectra change with @xmath28 significantly , where the higher @xmath28 quasars have systematically harder continua .",
    "we calculate the continuum slopes ( @xmath0 and @xmath2 ) for each composite spectrum and plot them as a function of @xmath28 in the sub - panel of the figure .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath2 values are close at high @xmath28 and show similar trends with luminosity . at the low luminosity side ( @xmath31 @xmath32 )",
    ", the change of the continuum slope with luminosity is very significant , while at the high luminosity side ( @xmath31 @xmath33 ) , quasar continua roughly keep a constant slope ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the redder spectra of lower luminosity quasars can hardly be explained by the accretion disk model , where the peak of the big blue bump moves toward lower frequency ( longer wavelength ) with increasing luminosity @xcite .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this discrepancy could be alleviated by assuming a higher intrinsic dust extinction in low luminosity quasars .",
    "indeed , there is observational evidence that the low luminosity agns have higher intrinsic dust extinction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such a luminosity dependent intrinsic dust extinction scenario is also consistent with a receding dust torus model @xcite .",
    "however , even if the dust extinction is independent of the quasar luminosity , quasars with higher extinction will also show lower luminosity and redder uv spectra .",
    "such a selection effect may also partly explain the @xmath35 relation we observed .      in this section",
    ", we test whether the quasar continuum slope shows systematical variance with redshift . as a first step , we divide the sample into five redshift bins with bin sizes of 1 from @xmath36 to 5 and make composites . similar to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we calculate the ratios of the composites to the global one for different redshift bins and show the results in fig .",
    "consistent with the finding of @xcite , we find little dependence of quasar spectra on redshift .",
    "however , the sdss quasar sample is roughly a magnitude limit sample and thus high redshift quasars are biased to high luminosity ones .",
    "according to the results in section 3.1 , if there are no evolutionary effects of quasar spectra , high redshift quasars should also have harder uv spectra .",
    "therefore , the apparent non - evolutionary quasar spectra implies another redshift dependent mechanism that could compensate for the luminosity bias . to recover this hidden effect , we make composite quasar spectra at different redshift bins after @xmath28 controlled .",
    "the quasars are grouped into two - dimensional bins of @xmath28 and @xmath37 .",
    "the bin width of @xmath28 is set to 0.5 dex in logarithm while the width of @xmath37 is set to either 0.1 or 0.2 according to the number of the quasars available for composite .",
    "the minimum number of quasars to make a composite spectrum is set to 20 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where the spectral slopes are plotted against redshift with diamonds ( @xmath0 ) and triangles ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the continuum slopes within the same @xmath28 bin are connected with lines , while different @xmath28 bins are represented by different colors .",
    "we find that in any given @xmath28 bin , quasars at higher redshifts have systematically redder uv continuum slopes ( for both @xmath0 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "this result clearly identifies the existence of the redshift dependence of quasar spectral slopes and implies that the previous debates are probably driven by redshift selection bias .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction , the cosmic dust extinction is a very interesting mechanism that can make the quasar continua systematically redder at high redshift .",
    "therefore , it is quite natural to introduce a cosmic dust extinction model to explain the results we have obtained in fig .",
    "other possibilities will be discussed in section 5 .",
    "we start from a toy model , which assumes that dust is uniformly distributed along the line of sight .",
    "considering the intervening dust has a comoving number density of @xmath38 , the optical depth of the cosmic dust to the photons with wavelength @xmath39 emitted from a quasar at redshift @xmath40 is @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the cross section of dust absorbers at wavelength @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "we assume that the properties of the absorbers do not evolve with redshift and @xmath44 is scaled by the cross section of the absorber at 5500@xmath19 , @xmath46 : @xmath47 where el(@xmath45 ) stands for the extinction law .",
    "we also assume that the intrinsic continuum of quasars in the uv - opt band can be characterized by a pure power - law form @xmath48 .",
    "quasars are put to their redshifts @xmath40 , and then , their observational spectral continuum can be rebuilt and slopes @xmath49 can be measured after considering the cosmic dust extinction from @xmath50 to @xmath36 . to mimic the observation , we also fit the continuum slopes in different wavelength ranges for quasars at different redshifts ( @xmath0 for @xmath51 and @xmath2 for @xmath52 ) . in this toy model , besides the extinction law , we have two free parameters , one is the combined parameter @xmath53 , which represents the effective density of the cosmic dust particles , and the other is @xmath54 , the intrinsic quasar continuum slope .",
    "we have little prior knowledge of the template extinction law of the cosmic dust . as the 2175 @xmath19 extinction bump",
    "is rarely seen in other galaxies , an smc - type extinction curve is preferred . in this study",
    ", we test the featureless smc extinction law first .",
    "we choose sets of representative values of @xmath55 and show the predicted @xmath49 as a function of @xmath40 , which are represented by the dashed parallel lines in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . here , @xmath56 is tuned to match the observed @xmath57 relation .    as can be seen",
    ", our simple cosmic dust extinction model can reproduce the observed @xmath57 relation at the low redshift range @xmath58 very well . at high redshift ,",
    "our model ( smc extinction curve and @xmath56 ) predicts a much steeper @xmath59 relation than that is observed .",
    "this discrepancy can be easily solved by adopting either a lower @xmath60 at @xmath61 or a shallower extinction curve at a far - uv wavelength . to keep our model simple , we test the later possibility . indeed , there are studies suggesting that the extinction curves in quasars are flatter in the uv @xcite .",
    "we take the flat reddening curve from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , gb07 ) , which is quite similar to the milky way extinction law , except for the lack of a 2175 @xmath19 bump .",
    "we show the gb07 dust extinction models with the same @xmath56 as the dotted lines in fig .",
    "as expected , the gb07 extinction curve matches the observation much better than the smc extinction curve at @xmath61 .    in order to have a more intuitive impression of the cosmic dust extinction , we take the gb07 dust extinction model and calculate the observer - frame extinction @xmath62 and reddening @xmath63 as a function of source redshift .",
    "the @xmath62 and @xmath63 are plotted in the upper and lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] respectively . in this plot",
    ", we also show the cosmic extinction constrained from a few other measurements for comparison .",
    "the dashed line shows the constant comoving dust extinction model of @xcite , which is constrained from the statistical detection of dust reddening around galaxies up to large scales .",
    "the other observational constraints are also extracted from fig .",
    "9 of @xcite , which includes the results from measuring the excess scatter seen in higher redshift quasar colors @xcite , using the tolman test @xcite , combining constraints from luminosity distances and @xmath64 @xcite , and using mgii absorbers ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see appendix c of @xcite for details ) .",
    "further study about the impact of cosmic dust on supernova cosmology can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this section , we discuss whether there are any other explanations to the redshift dependence of the quasar continuum slopes other than the cosmic dust .      in section 3.1",
    ", we have argued that the internal dust extinction might be the cause of the @xmath12-luminosity trend that we observed .",
    "could it also be responsible for the @xmath65 relation ?",
    "in general , we know that metal and dust are accumulated through various processes in the galaxy evolution , e.g. , dust formation in type ii supernova and asymptotic giant branch stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , galaxies at lower redshifts will typically have more dust .",
    "this global trend is opposite to the @xmath65 relation we observed for quasars .",
    "however , we know that quasar host galaxies are atypical .",
    "many observations have shown the presence of large dust mass in high redshift @xmath66 quasars ; though , the origin of the large amount of dust in such early epochs is unclear ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , there are also clues that the extinction curves of redshift @xmath66 quasars might be different from their lower redshift counterparts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite the variations , we have not yet found any statistical evidence that quasars at higher redshifts show systematically higher intrinsic extinctions , at least for the redshift range we probed ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that such a possibility still opens .",
    "besides the possible evolution of the intrinsic dust , could other physical properties ( e.g. , the black hole accretion process ) of quasars evolve ?",
    "since the black hole accretion is a local physical process , we do not expect that they show significant redshift evolution effects once their basic physical parameters are fixed ( e.g. , black hole mass or accretion rate ) . in this work ,",
    "we group quasars into @xmath68 bins and do not further consider the variation of other physical parameters .",
    "however , we have tested that whether , even after constraining quasars to small black hole mass @xmath69 and eddington ratio @xmath70 ranges ( 0.1 dex ) in the original 2d @xmath68 bins , the anti - correlation between @xmath12 and redshift still exists .",
    "quasars are hosted by galaxies , but they outshine them in most cases",
    ". however , for the low luminosity quasars at low redshift , the contamination of starlight might still be significant , especially at the near - uv band , i.e. , @xmath2 . for a @xmath31 @xmath71 quasar ,",
    "a bright star - forming host galaxy with @xmath72 contributes @xmath73% of the flux in the @xmath74 range .",
    "more than that , the redshift range of the near - uv band we probed is from @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "this is the time when the cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) starts to decrease .",
    "therefore , it is possible that there are larger contributions of the starlight at higher redshift , so that makes the quasar spectra look redder .    to test this possibility",
    ", we generate a series of model galaxy spectra at different redshifts according to the cosmic star formation history given in and their luminosities are assumed to be @xmath72 .",
    "we then combine the galaxy spectra at different redshifts with the composite spectrum of @xmath31 @xmath77 quasars .",
    "again , we measure the @xmath2 for the synthetic quasar+galaxy spectra at different redshifts . we find that , globally , @xmath2 becomes smaller ( redder ) when the galaxy spectra is combined into the quasar continuum .",
    "however , on the other hand , we do not find that the combined spectra get redder toward high redshift .",
    "the reason is that , while going to the higher redshifts from @xmath78 to @xmath79 , because of the higher sfr , not only does the contribution of the starlight in the near - uv band become larger , but the near - uv band spectrum of the galaxy itself also becomes bluer .",
    "sdss quasars are selected using a complicated color - based algorithm @xcite .",
    "quasar candidates at high and low redshift are selected based on different color - color diagrams .",
    "therefore , the color - selection criteria might introduce biases to the intrinsic colors of quasars at different redshifts .",
    "for example , is it possible that the redder quasar continua at higher redshifts are caused by the missing of red quasars at low redshift or vice versa ?    to test this possibility , we take the reddest ( the last magenta diamond in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) composite spectrum and put it at different redshifts ( from @xmath80 to 0 ) and calculate their observed colors .",
    "we do the same thing for the bluest one ( the first green triangle ) .",
    "we find that the tracks of the colors of these two composites along the redshift still assemble in the quasar color - color selection area . from this test",
    ", we argue that there is no significant selection bias in the colors of quasars at different redshifts in sdss .",
    "in this letter , we use a large non - bal radio - quiet quasar sample from sdss dr7 to study the redshift and bolometric luminosity dependence of quasar continuum slope by means of the composite spectrum .",
    "consistent with previous studies , we find that the uv - opt spectrum becomes harder toward higher bolometric luminosity , and we suggest that the internal dust reddening might be the main reason for this luminosity dependence .    when the bolometric luminosity is controlled , we find that the quasar uv continuum slope is anti - correlated with redshift ( redder at higher redshift ) .",
    "we propose that the redshift dependence of the quasar uv slope might be caused by the reddening of the cosmic dust .",
    "we build a simple cosmic dust extinction model to quantify the reddening of the quasars . based on our model , we find that an effective dust density @xmath6 at @xmath7 can reasonably reproduce the @xmath57 relation .",
    "the @xmath59 relation at high redshift ( @xmath61 ) can also be easily reproduced by using a shallow extinction curve or adopting a smaller effective density of the cosmic dust .",
    "the cosmic dust extinction constrained from our model is globally consistent with the constrains from other independent measurements , and has reached to an unprecedented high redshift ( @xmath81 ) .",
