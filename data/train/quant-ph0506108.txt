    "beam splitters ( bs ) and avalanche photodetectors ( apds ) play a fundamental role in quantum information processing .",
    "these key elements , among the other applications , can be used in order to generate non - gaussian states from gaussian ones @xcite and to distill continuous - variable entanglement @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on the output state recently obtained experimentally by j.  wenger _",
    "_  @xcite by means of photon subtraction on a squeezed vacuum state @xmath0 , @xmath5 being the squeezing operator .",
    "more precisely , when a gaussian state , such as @xmath0 , is mixed with the vacuum at a beam splitter and , then , on / off photodetection is performed on the reflected beam , an unknown number of photons is subtracted from the input state and the output state is no longer gaussian , i.e. , the input state is de - gaussified : this is due to the fact that the positive operator valued measure ( povm ) describing the apd is non - gaussian . since the actual number of detected photons can not be resolved by the apd , in @xcite we referred to this process as to inconclusive photon subtraction ( ips ) . in general",
    "the ips process can be characterized by two parameters : the beam splitter transmissivity @xmath1 and the quantum efficiency @xmath2 of the apd .",
    "as we will see , the conditional output state obtained by ips on a squeezed vacuum is close to the squeezed fock state @xmath3 , which is otherwise difficult to produce by hamiltonian processes .",
    "for this reason , we address ips as an effective resource to generate those squeezed fock states .",
    "we find that the ips conditional state reduces to @xmath3 in the limit @xmath6 , whereas for different values of the transmissivity and of the quantum efficiency it remains close to this target state , showing a high fidelity for a wide range of the parameters .",
    "finally , since the ips state obtained from the squeezed vacuum is , in general , non classical and mixed , we study how the purity and the nonclassical depth of the ips state depend on @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and on the input squeezing parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ s : ips ] we review the main elements of the ips process on a single mode of radiation .",
    "the fidelity between the ips conditional state and the squeezed fock state @xmath8 , as well as its purity are then investigated in section [ s : fid ] , whereas section [ s : nonclass ] is devoted to the analysis of the nonclassicality of the ips state .",
    "finally , section [ s : remarks ] closes the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "scheme of the ips process : the input state @xmath9 is mixed with the vacuum state @xmath10 at a beam splitter ( bs ) with transmissivity @xmath1 ; then , avalanche photodetection ( apd ) with quantum efficiency @xmath2 is performed on the reflected beam .",
