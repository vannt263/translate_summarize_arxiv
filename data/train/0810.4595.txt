    "the corresponding energy formulae can the easily deduced from the expectation values in the reduced representations .",
    "as example , the gell - mann - okubo mass formula can be derived using this ansatz @xcite . in many situations ,",
    "the labels obtained from the reduction ( [ red1 ] ) are sufficient to solve the problem , e.g. , of we require multiplicity free reductions , as used in @xmath2 tumbling gauge models @xcite or the interacting boson model @xcite .",
    "however , often the subgroup does not provide a sufficient number of labels to specify the basis states unambigously , due to multiplicities greater than one for induced representations .",
    "this turns out to be the rule for non - canonical embeddings and generic representations of @xmath3 .",
    "for some special types , like totally symmetric or anti - symmetric representations , additional labels are not necessary to solve the problem , and the degeneracies can be solved directly with the available operators .",
    "many procedures methods have been developed to solve the so - called missing label problem ( short mlp ) , from specific construction of states for the reduction chain to the formal construction of all possible labelling operators using enveloping algebras @xcite .",
    "the latter procedure allows in theory to find the most general labelling operator , although the effective computation of admissible operators is rather cumbersome .",
    "in addition , there is no general criterion to compute the number of operators necessary to generate integrity bases in enveloping algebras .    in the mid seventies ,",
    "peccia and sharp @xcite considered an analytic approach to the mlp based on the method used to compute the generalized casimir invariants of lie algebras in the commutative frame .",
    "this method is very close to the interpretation of casimir operators as functions that are constant on co - adjoint orbits , and consists essentially on a restriction of this problem .",
    "the labelling operators are interpreted as solutions of a certain subsystem of partial differential equations corresponding to the embedded subalgebra .",
    "subgroup scalars are therefore the differential invariants of the subalgebra in a specific realization , and their symmetrization serves to separate multiplicities of reduced representations .",
    "although this approach is , in principle , computationally easier than the pure algebraic approach using operators in the enveloping algebra , the integration of such differential equations is far from being trivial .",
    "moreover , the orthogonality conditions required to the labelling operators , in order to avoid undesirable interactions , must be solved by pure algebraic methods in most cases .",
    "most of the mlp considered in the literature have been solved or studied from an algebraic or analytic point of view , generally looking for solutions of lowest degrees . in appearance , no attention has been paid to the properties that the embedding imply . @xcite . ]",
    "the embedding @xmath0 is conditioned by physical reasons , that is , the choice of the embedding class corresponds to some specific coupling scheme or some relevant internal property that must be emphasized ( like angular momentum ) .",
    "since the embedding determines the branching rules for irreducible representations , it should be expected that labelling operators needed to solve multiplicities are , in some manner , codified by the properties of the symmetry breaking determined by the reduction chain.when dealing with the mlp algebraically or analytically , it is not immediately clear to which extent we are using the properties of this embedding or the branching rules .",
    "moreover , we can ask whether the obtained labelling operators have some intrinsic or physical meaning at all . formulated in another way : are the labelling operators of the mlp completely determined by the reduction @xmath0 ( and therefore , by the underlying physics ) , or are they the result of a formal algebraic / analytic manipulation ?    in @xcite ,",
    "the missing label problem was approached from a quite general point of view , but having in mind the important fact observed in @xcite that symmetry breaking and contractions of lie algebras have many points in common .",
    "this actually is deeply related to the characterization of inhomogeneous algebras obtained from contractions of semisimple algebras @xcite .",
    "therefore , any reduction chain @xmath0 naturally induces a contraction of lie algebras .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask if the operators provided by the contraction @xmath3 ( the so - called contracted casimir operators ) can be used to solve the mlp completely .",
    "the idea , in a different form , had been used previously for angular momentum subalgebra , and can be seen clearly in the so - called rotor expansion method @xcite .    the main goal of the general contraction ansatz in labelling problems can be resumed in the following points :    1 .   find a procedure to solve the mlp using explicitly the properties of the embedding @xmath0 [ breaking symmetry @xmath4 contractions ] , that is , without invoking formal operators .",
    "2 .   justify a natural choice of labelling operators as ",
    "broken casimir operators \" .",
    "3 .   find a phenomenological explanation for the non - integer expectation values of labelling operators .    in this first development , only the contracted invariants",
    "were used to generate labelling operators .",
    "this approach was however sufficient to solve many physically relevant missing label problems , and the result were in perfect harmony with those obtained using other techniques .",
    "it was also observed that the method can fail to find a sufficient number of missing operators whenever the identity @xmath5 is satisfied .",
    "the failure is essentially a consequence of an insufficient number of invariants in the contraction .",
    "the aim of this work is to further develop the contraction procedure , but using not only the contracted invariants , but a certain decomposition induced in the casimir operators of the contracted algebra , which turn out to be subgroup scalars but no more invariants of the contraction . with this decomposition",
    ", we are able to surmount the difficulty for cases with insufficient number of contracted operators . a more interesting consequence of this fact is the possibility of explaining the existence of missing label operators of the same degree , as they have already been constructed in the algebraic frame .",
    "given a presentation @xmath6=c_{ij}^{k}x_{k}\\right\\}$ ] of a lie algebra @xmath7 in terms of generators and commutation relations , we are interested in ( polynomial ) operators @xmath8 in the generators of @xmath7 such that the constraint @xmath9=0 $ ] , ( @xmath10 ) is satisfied .",
    "such an operator necessarily lies in the centre of the enveloping algebra of @xmath7 , and is traditionally referred to as casimir operator .",
    "however , in many dynamical problems , the relevant invariant functions are not polynomials , but rational or even trascendental functions ( e.g. the inhomogeneous weyl group ) .",
    "therefore the approach with the universal enveloping algebra has to be generalized in order to cover arbitrary lie groups .",
    "the most widely used method is the analytical realization .",

    "a function @xmath14 is an invariant of @xmath7 if and only if it satisfies the system of pdes @xmath15 using the symmetrization map @xmath16 , we recover the casimir operator for polynomial solutions . with this analytical ansatz",
    ", it is easily seen that the number of independent solutions is @xmath17.\\ ] ]    as already commented , one of the main applications of casimir operators of lie algebras is the labelling of irreducible representations . in a more general approach ,",
    "irreducible representations of a lie algebra @xmath3 can be labelled using the eigenvalues of its generalized casimir invariants @xcite . for each representation ,",
    "the number of internal labels needed is given by @xmath18 for the special case of semisimple lie algebras , this number is deeply related to the number of positive roots of its complexification .",
    "if we use some subalgebra @xmath19 to label the basis states of @xmath3 , the embedding provides @xmath20 labels , where @xmath21 is the number of invariants of @xmath3 that depend only on variables of the subalgebra @xmath22 @xcite . in general , this is still not sufficient to separate multiplicities of induced representations , so that we need to find @xmath23 additional operators , which are commonly called missing label operators .",
    "the total number of available operators of this kind is twice the number of needed labels , @xmath24 . for the case @xmath25 ,",
    "it remains the problem of determining a set of @xmath26 mutually commuting operators , as commented before .",
    "these operators can be seen to be subgroup scalars , so that the analytical approach is a practical method to find the labelling operators .",
    "considering the realization of @xmath0 by differential operators indicated in ( [ sys ] ) , we restrict to the pdes corresponding to subgroup generators @xmath27 solutions to this system @xmath28 reproduce the differential invariants in @xmath29 dimensions .",
    "the total number of solutions of the latter system is given by : @xmath30 we observe that ( [ ml2 ] ) refers to the number of functionally independent solutions .",
    "integrity bases , constrained by the coarser algebraic independence , will generally have much more elements than ( [ ml2 ] ) , and no general procedure is known to compute its dimension .",
    "in addition , to be useful as labelling operators , two ( symmetrized ) solutions @xmath31 of system ( [ sml ] ) must satisfy the orthogonality condition @xmath32=0 $ ] and commute with the casimir operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 of @xmath7 and the subalgebra @xmath35 .",

    "moreover , by the contraction we have the inequality @xmath46 .",
    "the system of pdes corresponding to this contraction can be divided into two parts :    @xmath47    the subsystem ( [ ks1 ] ) corresponds to the generators of @xmath35 realized as subalgebra of @xmath7 , while the remaining equations ( [ ks2 ] ) describe the representation .",

    "the following questions arise naturally :    1 .",
    "do polynomial functions of the invariants of these algebras suffice to determine @xmath26 mutually orthogonal missing label operators ? 2 .   can all available operators found by this procedure ?",
    "the answer to the first equation is in the affirmative for those cases where the contraction provides a number of independent invariants exceeding the number of needed labelling operators .",
    "it fails when these two quantities coincide , which suggests that the procedure has to be refined .",
    "the answer to the second question is generally in the negative ( see e.g. the algebras with one missing label ) , although it can not be excluded that with the refinement proposed in this work we are able to recover a complete set of independent labelling operators for some special reductions . in most cases ,",
    "only half of the available operators should be expected , since all operators obtained are the result , in some sense , of  breaking \" the original casimir operators . whether a further refinement allows to obtain additional labelling operators that are independent remains for the moment an unanswered question .",
    "in this section we prove that the contraction induced by the reduction chain induces a decomposition of the corresponding casimir operators of @xmath7 , which allow , among other properties , to determine the invariants of the contraction @xmath3",
    ". however , other terms are also relevant for the missing label problem , and constitute the solution to the problem pointed out in @xcite when the number of invariants of the contraction is not sufficient .",
    "these additional terms do not constitute invariants of the contraction , and where therefore not considered in @xcite .",
    "we briefly recall the definition of contracted invariants .",
    "since classical inn - wigner contractions are the only type of contractions needed for the labelling problem , we can restrict ourselves to this case @xcite .",
    "let @xmath51 be a @xmath52-order casimir operator of @xmath7 .",
    "then the transformed invariant takes the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 . taking the maximal power in @xmath55 ,",
    "@xmath56 the limit @xmath57 provides a casimir operator of degree @xmath58 of the contraction @xmath59 .",
    "now , instead of extracting only the term with the highest power of @xmath55 , we consider the whole decomposition @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 is a function of the casimir operators of the subalgebra @xmath35 ( these generators have not been re - scaled ) .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that @xmath63 is not only an invariant of the contraction @xmath3 , but also a solution to the mlp . ,",
    "equation ( [ coz ] ) shows how the casimir operator decomposes into homogeneous polynomials in the variables of the subalgebra and the complementary space over the original basis .",
    "] this first term was central to the argumentation in @xcite , and allowed to obtain commuting sets of labelling operators .",
    "however , the remaining terms can also be individually considered as candidates for labelling operators , as states the following    the functions @xmath64 are solutions of the missing label problem , that is , they satisfy the system @xmath65    first of all , the decomposition ( [ coz ] ) tells that the casimir operator @xmath66 can be rewritten as a sum of homogeneous polynomials @xmath67 with the property that @xmath63 is of homogeneity degree @xmath68 in the variables @xmath69 associated to subalgebra generators and degree @xmath70 in the remaining variables @xmath71 . accordingly , any @xmath64 is of degree @xmath72 in the variables @xmath69 and @xmath73 in the @xmath71 .",

    "this means that evaluating @xmath79 is a sum of polynomials of different bi - degree , and since @xmath66 is a casimir operators , the only possibility is that each term is a solution of the system .",
    "we thus conclude that the @xmath64 are solutions of ( [ ks1 ] ) .",
    "the first question that arises from decomposition ( [ coz ] ) is how many independent additional solutions we obtain .",

    "2 .   if @xmath85 , then at most @xmath86 polynomials @xmath84 are functionally independent on the casimir operators of @xmath7 and @xmath35 .",

    "the number of independent terms depends also on the representation @xmath38 induced by the reduction @xcite . in any case , however , at least one independent term is obtained for any casimir operator of degree at least three . for the special case of @xmath89 labelling operator , two terms independent on the casimir operators were found , which allowed to select one as the labelling operator @xcite .",
    "once a set of functionally independent solutions to system ( [ ks1 ] ) has been chosen ( including the casimir operators ) , the first part of the labelling problem is solved .",
    "now , if we want to obtain a set of commuting operators , we have to look for all commutators among the symmetrized operators @xmath84 .",
    "we denote by @xmath90 the symmetrized polynomial .",

    "actually this brackets is expressible as sum of polynomials of different bi - degree , and these terms constitute themselves labelling operators @xcite . a procedure to solve the missing label problem",
    "can thus be resumed in the following steps :    * decompose the casimir operators of @xmath7 of degree @xmath93 with respect to the associated contraction . *",
    "determine the commutator of all symmetrized polynomials @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "* from those commuting operators , extract @xmath26 operators that are functionally independent from the casimir operators of @xmath7 and the subalgebra @xmath35 .    in general ,",
    "the second step is reduced to pure computation .",
    "there is no simple procedure to determine whether two missing label operators are mutually orthogonal , although various symbolic routines have been developed to compute these brackets ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in some special circumstances , however , the decomposition ( [ coz ] ) can provide orthogonality without being forced to compute the brackets . if for a specific mlp it is known that no solutions of bi - degree @xmath96 exists for some fixed @xmath97 , and if we have two labelling operators such that @xmath91 $ ] is a sum of polynomials of bi - degree @xmath98 , then the commutation follows at once .",
    "this idea was first explored systematically in @xcite .",
    "we remark that in the commutative frame , it would suffice to show that no polynomial function of bi - degree @xmath96 is a solution to subsystem ( [ ks1 ] ) .",

    "in this section we show how the decomposition of casimir operators of higher order provide solutions to missing label problem that could not be solved completely by only using the contraction , or for which no proposed set of labelling operators has been computed yet .",
    "we insist on the fact that the main difficulty in the formal approach to the mlp resides in obtaining a sufficient number of ( functionally ) independent labelling operators , from which a commuting set can be extracted .",
    "this chain was indicated in @xcite to give an insufficient number of labelling operators when only the contraction invariants are considered .",

    "this subdivision can not however be deduced from the contraction , since all generators of the subalgebra play the same role .",
    "some important aspects of the decomposition method of casimir operators based on the contractions and its use in labelling problems are specially emphasized :    * the solutions provide a  natural \" choice for the labelling operators .",
    "their interpretation as  broken \" casimir operators confers them a certain physical meaning , in contrast to operators obtained by pure algebraic means , where the physical interpretation of the operator is often not entirely clear . *",
    "the decomposition provides also a consistent explanation to the question why a number of reduction chains give labelling operators of the same degree .",
    "this fact is directly related to an insufficient number of invariants in the contraction associated to the chain .",
    "* this could probably explain why the eigenvalues of such labelling operators are not integers , as already indicated by racah @xcite .",
    "it follows from the decomposition that the eigenvalues of the labelling operators contribute to the eigenvalues of the casimir operators . in this context , the interpretation of a labelling operator as  broken \" casimir operator leads to the idea of  broken \" integer eigenvalues .",
    "some questions still remain open , namely , whether there exist reductions @xmath0 for which the method followed here provides all available labelling operators .",
    "an answer in this direction implies to find the general solution to the mlp for each considered chain .",
    "nowadays , only for a few number of algebras these computations have been carried out completely @xcite .",
    "a complete study of all physically relevant reduction chains involving simple lie algebras up to some fixed rank would certainly provide new insights to this problem . on the other hand , in",
