    "in addition , no  matches are consistent with main sequence stars ; most of them are likely evolved intermediate- and/or low - mass stars .",

    "the optical emission associated with galactic lmxbs are related to their accretion disks rather than their companions .",
    "we also checked whether or not any of these optical matches could be an accretion disk by comparing the  photometric data to the best - fit disk - blackbody component .",
    "we first analyzed the  and  data ( obsids 11840 and 0650560201 ) , which are taken on similar epochs as the  phat data ( 2010 july 24 for f275w and f336w , and 2010 december 2526 for f475w and f814w ) to measure the disk - blackbody flux during those periods .",
    "similar to the previous section , we applied an absorbed power - law plus disk - blackbody model in the 0.57.0 kev band .",
    "the results are given in table  [ t:2010spec ] .",
    "due to the small number of counts in the spectra ( especially the  spectrum ) , we fixed the absorption to the galactic value . the  observation in 2010 july did not constrain the disk component ; therefore , we fixed the disk temperature at @xmath37 = 0.2 kev . for the  data taken in 2010 december , the spectrum contains both s184 and s188 as they were not resolved in the  observation .",

    "these spectral fitting results suggest that swift j0042.6 + 4112  was 25 times dimmer than in the oct 2015 -observation .",

    "the right panel of figure  [ f : hst_counters ] shows two sed ( f814w , f475w , f336w and f275w photometry data points ) examples of the  matches with the best - fit absorbed disk - blackbody models obtained from table  [ t:2010spec ] to see if the uv / optical counterpart is related to the accretion disk .",
    "we note that the power - law component is unlikely to be emitted in the uv - optical band ; therefore , it is omitted .",

    "the x - ray broadband ( 0.550 kev ) spectral properties ,",
    "i.e. , the hard spectrum ( @xmath68 1 ) at lower energies with a cutoff around 1520 kev , are more consistent with galactic x - ray pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than with black hole binaries and neutron star binaries with weak magnetic fields ( z - sources and atoll sources ) .",

    "one of the well - studied systems with a soft excess is the galactic x - ray pulsar her x-1 . in this case",
    "the soft excess is modeled as reprocessed hard x - rays through the inner edge of the accretion disk @xcite .",

    "swift j0042.6 + 4112  may not be a young system , but perhaps the compact object does not have enough accreted material yet to decay its magnetic field , making it still an x - ray pulsar .    alternatively ,",

    "since there is no potential high - mass donor in the field , they suggest that the system is likely an accreting pulsar with an intermediate donor like her x-1 or an ultracompact binary with a very low mass donor .",
    "this suggests that a similar population to swift j0042.6 + 4112  exists in m31 . however , it is unclear why only swift j0042.6 + 4112  dominates the entire galaxy at hard energies .",
    "lastly , we consider a possibility that it is a galactic source along the line of sight toward m31 , such as an intermediate polar ( ip ) cv system , symbiotic x - ray binary , ultracompact binary or black widow .",
    "ip cv systems are known to have hard x - ray emission .",
    "we can estimate a probability that swift j0042.6 + 4112  is a galactic ip using the space density derived from the  bat 70-month catalog by @xcite .",
    "assuming that ips are detectable up to 500 pc , we expect 0.09 and 0.001 foreground ips for the area of the entire m31 galaxy and the central 6  radius , respectively , for the observed 14195 kev flux of 9 @xmath6 10@xmath7  toward the m31 direction ( b= @xmath7221@xmath73 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of these systems are generally characterized with thermal ( multi - temperature ) emission with compton reflection with an association of the fe k fluorescent line ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",

    "if we assume a galactic source located at 110 kpc , the expected x - ray luminosity would be about 10@xmath77 ",
    "10@xmath15  in the 0.550 kev band .",
    "at these distances , the  image should identify its companion down to a 0.2  0.5  main - sequence star .",

    "hence , it is unlikely to be a galactic symbiotic x - ray binary .",
    "galactic black widows may contain very low mass companions ( @xmath0 0.1 ) , which may be at or below the   detection limit ( e.g. @xmath78 23 for psr j1953 + 1846a at 4 kpc ; @xcite ) .",
