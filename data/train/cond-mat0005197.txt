    "second - order phase transitions have universal behavior , associated with long wavelength fluctuations , for which critical exponents and other universal quantities can often be successfully calculated using renormalization group techniques . for most such systems",

    "in contrast , the phase transition of a dilute , interacting bose gas provides a fascinating example where physics becomes simpler , and perturbative , at ( relatively ) small distance scales . for this system",

    "a simple example of such a non - universal quantity is the phase transition temperature @xmath2 , and the effect of interactions on @xmath2 has been explored by several authors @xcite , with a wide variety of theoretical results .",

    "even though marginal , this last interaction can be ignored at the order of interest in the diluteness expansion because it has a small coefficient .",
    "for example , consider the term that would arise directly from the presence of a correction @xmath62 to the original lagrangian ( [ eq : l1 ] ) .",

    "similarly , an effective @xmath67 term arising from the 4-point interactions @xmath49 and from integrating out physics at the scale @xmath36 ( due , for example , to non - zero matsubara modes ) would give rise to a @xmath68 term in ( [ eq : o2 ] ) with coefficient proportional to @xmath69 . ] and do not affect the computation of @xmath70 at leading order in @xmath71 .",
