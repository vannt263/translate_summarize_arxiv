    "despite the widespread recent theoretical and experimental interest in quantum phase transitions , a direct quantitative confrontation between theory and experiment has been difficult to achieve for systems in two and higher spatial dimensions .",
    "a major obstacle is that it is often difficult to tune system parameters over the range necessary to move across a quantum critical point .",
    "furthermore , for many examples where such tuning is possible , the theory for the quantum critical point is intractable .",
    "consequently , the analysis of the data is often limited to the testing of general scaling ansatzes , without specific quantitative theoretical predictions .    a class of quantum phase transitions",
    "have recently been exceptionally well characterized in a variety of experiments .",
    "these experiments study the influence of a strong applied magnetic field on insulating spin - gap compounds@xcite .",
    "the low lying spin excitations behave like spin @xmath7 canonical bose particles , and the energy required to create these bosons vanishes at a critical field @xmath8 , which signals the position of a quantum phase transition@xcite with dynamic critical exponent @xmath9 . in spatial dimensions",
    "@xmath10 , the quantum critical fluctuations are well described by the familiar bose - einstein theory of non - interacting bosons , and no sophisticated theory of quantum criticality is therefore necessary to interpret the experiments .",
    "the upper - critical dimension of the quantum critical point is @xmath11 , and the boson - boson interaction vanishes logarithmically at low momenta .",
    "so naively , one expects that the @xmath11 case is also weakly coupled , and no non - trivial quantum critical behavior obtains .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to show that the above expectation for the quantum - criticality of @xmath11 bose gas is incorrect .",
    "while the pairwise interactions between the bosons are indeed weak , the collective properties of the finite - density , thermally excited bose gas pose a strong - coupling problem .",
    "we will demonstrate here that an effective classical model , which can be readily numerically simulated , provides a controlled description of this problem .",
    "this will allow us to present predictions for the evolution of the dynamic spectrum of the @xmath11 bose gas across the quantum critical point at non - zero temperatures .",

    "these experiments are able to easily access the finite temperature quantum - critical region , which we will describe by our theory of the dilute bose gas in @xmath11 ; this bose gas is in a regime of parameters which is typically not examined in the context of more conventional atomic bose gas systems @xcite .",
    "results similar to those presented here @xcite also apply to other quantum critical points with upper - critical spatial dimension @xmath11 _ i.e. _ while the zero temperature properties can be described in a weak - coupling theory , all non - zero temperature observables require solution of a strong - coupling problem .",

    "we shall argue , that to leading order in the logarithm , these strong coupling effects can be captured in an effective classical model .",
    "the latter model is amenable to straightforward numerical simulations , and so accurate quantitative predictions become possible , whose precision is limited only by the available computer time .",
    "previous analyses @xcite of the dilute bose gas in two dimensions assumed ( when extended to the quantum critical region ) that @xmath43 was large ; a more precise version of this condition appears below , from which it is clear that this condition is essentially impossible to satisfy in practice .",
    "we will not make any assumption on the value of such a double logarithm , and only make the much less restrictive assumption on a large single logarithm .",
    "the characteristic length and time scales of the quantum - critical bose gas are set by a dimensionful parameter , which we denote @xmath17 . like @xmath16 ,",
    "we choose this to have dimensions of energy ; so a characteristic length is @xmath44 , while a characteristic time is @xmath45 .",
