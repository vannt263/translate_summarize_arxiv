    "weak gravitational lensing is already one of the more accurate constraints on cosmological parameters : several groups have measured the power spectrum of the shear induced on background galaxies by foreground mass fluctuations , leading to @xmath7 constraints on the matter power spectrum normalization @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the weak lensing method has potential for much more precise constraints on @xmath8 and other parameter combinations , once larger sky areas are surveyed .",
    "the addition of redshift information on the source galaxies allows measurement of the mass power spectrum as a function of redshift , which is expected to greatly increase the accuracy of weak lensing cosmological constraints @xcite and permit reconstruction of the three - dimensional mass distribution @xcite .",
    "weak lensing surveys currently underway such as the cfht legacy survey ( cfhls ) and the deep lens survey will gather photometric redshift information to facilitate this `` tomographic '' analysis .",
    "the successful constraint of the mass power spectrum and cosmological parameters at @xmath9 levels will require reduction of several sources of systematic error . on the theoretical side ,",
    "there are not yet predictions of the mass power spectrum @xmath10 that are accurate to the percent level in the non - linear regime ( see @xcite for further discussion ) .",
    "a concerted application of @xmath11-body computing would likely yield the dark - matter spectrum to desired accuracy , though on very small scales the contribution of baryons to the power spectrum must be included , and will be difficult to calculate .",
    "the inaccuracies of power - spectrum estimation may be bypassed by using only large - scale information , where linear or perturbative calculations suffice , but this means discarding most of the lensing information , which lies at non - linear scales .    on the measurement side , currently published",
    "power - spectrum measurements all show contamination by systematic errors at the @xmath7 level or higher .",
    "this systematic power is likely residual from the process of correcting galaxy shapes for point - spread function ( psf ) effects .",
    "new methodologies have been introduced @xcite which should greatly reduce the systematic contamination , but this remains to be demonstrated .",
    "there are also subtle difficulties in calibrating the weak lensing signal to 1% accuracy @xcite .",
    "@xcite introduce a new method for analysing weak - lensing data with depth information which promises to largely bypass these systematic difficulties .",
    "the basic concept is to use the survey s photometric redshift data to create a map of the foreground galaxies , from which an estimated map of the foreground mass can be made .",
    "this foreground mass slice induces shear on all the galaxies in the background .",
    "the measurement consists of tracking the amplitude of the induced shear as a function of the background redshift .",
    "once a foreground shear `` template '' at @xmath12 is created , the dependence of shear on the source redshift @xmath1 is given solely by geometric factors . by taking ratios of induced shears at different @xmath1 , any sensitivity to errors in the foreground mass template",
    "is cancelled out , leaving us with a purely geometric observable .",
    "one is not attempting to discern the line - of - sight structure , so this is not tomography .",
    "we could call this `` cross - correlation cosmography '' since the measured quantities are metric elements of the homogeneous cosmology .",
    "the idea of using lensing effects on sources at differing redshift to constrain cosmological parameters has been examined before @xcite , with jain & taylor offering a methodology for massive datasets that is insensitive to the nature of cluster or halo profiles and examines a time - dependent dark energy component .",
    "the practical advantages of cross - correlation cosmography include :    * no theoretical estimate of the mass power spectrum is required .",
    "the mass fluctuations are estimated directly from the foreground galaxy distribution , and any inaccuracies ( _ e.g. _  bias ) are cancelled out in the analysis .",
    "the observables are hence calculable to arbitrary accuracy . * with no need for a modelled power spectrum , we can use shear information on all scales sampled by the data .",
    "the lensing distortion variance @xmath13 is @xmath14 , which is at least two orders of magnitude larger than the variance due solely to linear - regime fluctuations .",
    "hence the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath15 ) of the weak lensing data will be much higher .",
    "* because the background shear is being cross - correlated with a template , the shear signal enters only linearly into the statistics .",
    "systematic power ( _ e.g. _  psf residuals ) average to zero since they will not correlate with the foreground shear template .",
    "this makes the psf - correction task immensely easier than for power - spectrum tomography , in which systematic power adds to the shear power . for cross - correlation cosmography , systematic power may increase uncertainties but does not bias the results . in the language of experimenters , we have changed from a total - power measurement to a phase - sensitive method .",
    "* uncertainties in calibration of the shear signal also cancel if they are independent of @xmath1 , since we will be interested only in ratios of shear at different @xmath1 .",
    "we shall see below , however , that the method is highly sensitive to _ differential _ calibration errors .    taking the ratio of shear signals at different @xmath1 provides a pure geometric measurement , but taking this ratio does decrease the dependence of the signal on cosmological parameters .",
    "large numbers of galaxies must be surveyed in order to reduce random errors to make up for the smaller signals , but surveys of up to @xmath16 galaxies are currently being planned .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the potential of cross - correlation cosmography by proposing an analysis methodolgy that appears close to optimal , and calculating the expected cosmological - parameter uncertainties with the fisher - matrix method .",
    "we then apply this analysis to some planned weak lensing surveys .",
    "finally we return to the issue of systematic errors , exploring the accuracies that will be required for photometric redshift estimates and shear calibration .",
    "the underlying assumption of the method is that the observed ellipticity of background galaxy @xmath17 is @xmath18 the quantities of interest will be the geometric factors @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the comoving distances to a lens and source planes , and @xmath22 is comoving angular diameter distance . for a flat universe , @xmath23 .",

    "imparted on a source plane at @xmath25 by the mass in redshift shell @xmath26 .",
    "it can be expressed as an integral over the mass distribution in the redshift shell by well - known formulae , _ e.g. _  @xcite .",
    "note that the distortion @xmath27 is twice the shear in the weak - lensing limit .",
    "its variance @xmath28 can be calculated as an integral of the mass power spectrum @xmath29 , with the formula in appendix  [ pspec ] .",
    "our method , however , will be to make as little use as possible of the power spectrum .    is correct only in the limit that the induced distortion @xmath24 , the instrumental systematic distortion @xmath30 , and the intrinsic galaxy shape @xmath31 are all @xmath32 .",
    "the addition operator in distortion space is in fact non - linear @xcite , a detail that will be important , but manageable if we avoid the @xmath33 of the sky where the lensing distortion is strong .",
    "any weak lensing measurement maximizes the likelihood of the measured @xmath34 under some model for the shear planes @xmath24 ( and perhaps the systematic error contribution simultaneously ) . in power - spectrum tomography ,",
    "one varies the assumed power spectra of the @xmath24 to best match the observed covariances of the @xmath34 . in our case , we will assume that is possible to produce some estimate @xmath35 of the distortion pattern without reference to the background galaxy - shape information .",
    "in practice this template distortion would be developed from the galaxies identified near @xmath0 from the photometric redshift data .",
    "this could be as simple as convolving the galaxy distribution with an isothermal halo model , or perhaps involve a more sophisticated identification of groups and clusters .",
    "we allow that the template distortion is inaccurate to some level , due to galaxy bias or other errors : @xmath36 @xmath37 is a measure of the fidelity of our template , and is related to the bias @xmath38 and correlation coefficient @xmath39 between galaxies and mass , _",
    "e.g. _  as measured by @xcite .    to isolate the geometric term",
    ", we correlate the template distortion with the measured distortion .",
    "we wish to sum the measurements from all source galaxies in some bin @xmath40 of redshift centered on @xmath1 .",
    "when the shape noise is dominant , the sum which is optimal in the sense of best @xmath15 on @xmath41 is @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the number of source galaxies in bin @xmath40 . under the model in the @xmath44 will be @xmath45 here the subscript @xmath40 on the average means that we are averaging over the galaxies in source bin @xmath40 , as in equation [ xls ] , not over realizations of the distortion fields . for a given survey ,",
    "the cosmology predicts the @xmath41 values , the templates are known , and the @xmath46 are free parameters .",
    "the cosmological parameters @xmath47 are determined by fitting the @xmath48 data vector to the model ( [ xlsmod ] ) with free parameters @xmath49 , then marginalizing over the cross - correlations @xmath50 to obtain confidence bounds for the @xmath51 . the intrinsic ellipticities and",
    "perhaps systematic errors act as measurement noise on each @xmath44 .",
    "we now assume that the intrinsic ellipticities @xmath31 and the systematic - error distortion @xmath52 are independent of the template .",
    "we also assume that the distortions and templates are uncorrelated between lens shells , so that @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "this last assumption is true if the shells are much thicker than the correlation length of the mass distribution ; any correlations could be accommodated in a more sophisticated analysis , or eliminated by applying high - pass filters to the templates . with these assumptions ,",
    "the expectation value for the @xmath44 when we average over realizations of the distortion fields is @xmath55      in order to calculate probabilities for fits to the @xmath56 vector we need its covariance matrix @xmath57 . from the definition ( [ xls ] ) and the model ( [ bfdk ] ) we can obtain the covariance in a straightforward manner .",
    "note that when fitting to the model ( [ bfdk ] ) we will be considering only the shape noise and systematic errors to be random variables .",
    "the distortion planes , or more precisely the cross - correlations @xmath46 , are considered as free parameters in the fit , not random variables .",
    "we will henceforth ignore the systematic distortion @xmath58 , assuming that it is a minor contributor to the noise compared to the shape noise @xmath59 .",
    "we have already seen that the systematic errors do not bias the observables if they are uncorrelated with the templates .",
    "we assume the @xmath31 to be independent , with @xmath60 the variance in each component .",
    "intrinsic correlations of galaxy shapes may slightly inflate our uncertainties , but should again be uncorrelated with the @xmath35 and hence will not bias the fit . in this case",
    "we have @xmath61 the @xmath54 cross - correlation is negligibly small if the survey is much larger than the correlation length of the distortion templates .",
    "the distributions of the @xmath24 and @xmath31 are very non - gaussian . for a survey with many source galaxies and an area much larger than the distortion correlation length , however , the distribution for @xmath44 should approach gaussian by the central limit theorem .",
    "the likelihood of an observed @xmath56 vector given a choice of model parameters is then given by the usual gaussian formula with covariance matrix @xmath57 . with the likelihood , we may produce confidence bounds on the parameters of the underlying geometry , once we marginalize over the unknown @xmath46 .",
    "given the likelihood function , the minimal uncertainties on the model parameters may be derived from the fisher matrix : @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "the fisher matrix for the gaussian case is well known , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite : @xmath64 as usual the subscripts with commas denote derivatives .",
    "this simplifies considerably in our case , as @xmath57 is diagonal and independent of the parameters .",
    "the model parameters are of two kinds : the nuisance parameters @xmath50 and the cosmological parameters @xmath47 .",
    "we wish to split the fisher matrix into submatrices @xmath65 ,",
    "@xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "henceforth we will adopt the convention that greek indices ( or @xmath26 ) range over the lens planes , the @xmath40 index runs over source planes , and other latin indices ( except @xmath26 ) range over the cosmological parameters . keeping in mind that it takes two greek indices to specify one @xmath68 component , the three submatrices @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are respectively @xmath69 the geometric factors are encoded in the matrices @xmath70 the redshift distribution of sources @xmath71 is normalized to unit integral , and @xmath11 is the total number of sources in the survey . there is no loss of information in moving to infinitesimal source - redshift bins .",
    "we are interested in the covariance matrix @xmath72 of the geometric parameters after marginalization over the @xmath68 parameters .",
    "if @xmath73 is the number of lens planes in the model , there are @xmath74 free @xmath46 being marginalized , and after this marginalization the constraints on the cosmological parameters are relatively weak for envisioned surveys .",
    "there is , however , additional information about the @xmath68 values that has not been incorporated into the model of , and hence not in the fisher matrix of .",
    "we expect that the @xmath46 are near zero for @xmath54 because the lens planes are uncorrelated .",
    "we incorporate this knowledge with a prior probability on the @xmath68 values .",
    "if the prior is gaussian , then we may add the inverse of the @xmath68 covariance matrix to the @xmath75 component of the fisher matrix .",
    "note that until this point we have had no use for an _ ensemble _ of mass distributions ; all of the quantities in the solution and fisher matrix for the cosmological parameters make use of just the @xmath46 for the single realization of the mass distribution that exists in our survey field .",
    "it is only in assembling a prior on these values ( and in estimating typical values in  [ marginalize ] ) that we make use of the ensemble properties of the mass distribution .",
    "this is why the sample variance contribution is unimportant in the uncertainties of the cross - correlation method .    in the appendix",
    "we show that the covariance matrix for @xmath46 is nearly diagonal .",
    "the diagonal terms are @xmath76 here @xmath77 is the total solid area of the survey and @xmath78 is a measure of the area of coherence of the two distortion fields @xmath79 and @xmath80 . for redshift ranges of interest , @xmath81 .",
    "the only off - diagonal terms in the covariance matrix for the @xmath68 values are @xmath82 to simplify the following algebra , we take the covariance matrix for our prior on @xmath68 to have diagonal elements that are twice as large as and drop the covariance between @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "this prior distribution is less restrictive than is the full covariance matrix , so we are at liberty to make this choice .    as a cautionary step we do not make use of the prior information on @xmath85 .",
    "this is because @xmath85 appears in the expectation value @xmath86 in , and hence prior assumptions may bias the fit for the cosmological parameters that drive the @xmath87 in this fit . with this simplified , diagonal prior for the @xmath68 values , the fisher matrix for the system is altered from as @xmath88 \\nonumber \\\\   & \\equiv &   \\delta_{\\alpha\\mu }",

    ". sample variance typically arises when one does not measure enough independent patches of the density field to adequately constrain its power spectrum . in our application , however , we are not using the power spectrum to measure cosmology , we instead are just cross - correlating the observations with whatever mass distribution the universe gives us .",
    "hence there is no sample variance contribution .    the left - hand term in arises purely from the shape noise in the measured field that is being cross - correlated with the templates , while the right - hand term arises because the distortion from one lens slice acts as a correlated noise source for all the @xmath44 .",
    "the right - hand term has an amplitude @xmath97 relative to the left - hand term , where @xmath73 is the number of lens planes and @xmath98 is the number of independent cells or patches of the distortion fields . in almost any large survey",

    "the integrals over the power spectrum are cut off for @xmath110 ; this is a crude way of accounting for the fact that we will have to exclude the central regions of galaxy clusters , where the lensing is strong and where the light of the foreground galaxies may preclude observation of the background galaxies .",
    "the results are not sensitive to the choice of the high-@xmath111 cutoff .",
    "we will assume that the estimated templates @xmath35 have the same variance as the true distortion fields @xmath27 , but with fidelity @xmath112 .",

    "other simplifications made by jain & taylor were that intrinsic ellipticity shot noise was taken to be the only source of error and only two bins in source redshift were used for each lens slice . we find that the method presented here can improve parameter constraints , primarily due to the use of more than two redshift slices .",

    "we see that the minimum detectable cosmological signature corresponds to a change of @xmath147 parts in @xmath5 of @xmath148 , and hence an equivalent change in the measured distortion vs @xmath1 .",
    "we may immediately conclude that _ exploitation of this technique to constrain @xmath104 requires that the distortion calibration be constant to 1 part in @xmath5 over all measured redshifts .",
    "_ this will be a significant technical challenge .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that present algorithms have calibration errors of 110% , so at least an order - of - magnitude improvement is required .",
    "@xcite and @xcite propose methods to improve calibration accuracy , but these have not yet been demonstrated on real data .",
    "furthermore , most methodologies assume that the distortion is weak , _",
    "i.e. _  they ignore induced changes to galaxy shape that are of order @xmath149 or higher .",
    "the non - linear effects of even `` weak '' distortions will have to be accounted for to second or even third order to reach the calibration accuracy of @xmath150 .",
    "regions where the lensing is strong will clearly have to be avoided .",
    "to estimate the demands of this requirement on the data reduction methodology , we note that the conversion of observed ellipticities to pre - seeing elliptiticities typically involves the factor @xmath151 , where @xmath39 is the angular radius of the ( pre - seeing ) galaxy and @xmath152 is the psf radius .",
    "a good weak lensing methodology makes use of galaxies as small as @xmath153 ; in this case , both @xmath39 and @xmath152 must be known to better than 1 part in @xmath5 in order to obtain a distortion calibration accurate to 1 part in @xmath150 .",
    "if @xmath39 were independent of @xmath139 , then we would have redshift - independent calibration errors , which do not affect the cross - correlation method .",
    "but fainter , more distant galaxies are typically smaller in angular diameter , so errors in @xmath152 will couple to the cosmography measurement .      our formalism can be adapted to deal with the _ random errors _ in photometric redshift measurements , but it will still be crucial to minimize _ biases _ in the photo-@xmath139 estimates . the quantity @xmath41 scales slightly less than linearly with the redshifts @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "it is therefore clear that mis - estimates of the mean photometric redshift of a few parts in @xmath5 would overwhelm the signal of a @xmath146 cosmology . hence _",
    "photometric redshifts must be accurate to @xmath154 in @xmath155 .",
    "_ this again is at least one order of magnitude beyond the present state of the art .",
    "it is important to realize first that this is not the requirement on the accuracy of _ each _ measured photometric redshift , but rather a requirement on the _ bias _ of a collection of photometric redshift estimates .",
    "second , we are not required to use all the galaxies in the image .",
    "one would likely choose to exclude from the analysis galaxies whose colors make assignment of a photometric redshift particularly uncertain or ambiguous .",
    "if the required accuracy of distortion and redshift calibration can not be achieved , one could introduce additional free parameters in the model to represent calibration errors .",
    "these terms would be purely functions of @xmath1 , and hence in theory distinguishable from the cosmological signals , which couple @xmath0 and @xmath1 through @xmath156 . the constraints on dark energy would be degraded , to an extent that is calculable with further fisher analysis .",
    "we note that if the random error in a typical photometric redshift is @xmath157 , then it will take a spectroscopic survey of @xmath158 galaxies in order to check that the mean error ( bias ) is below @xmath159 .",
    "repeating this bias check in bins of redshift from 03 would thus require a sample of @xmath160 or @xmath161 spectroscopic redshifts to compare with the photometric redshifts .",
    "redshift surveys of this size to limiting magnitudes of 24 or 25 will be feasible : indeed the deep2 survey is already well on its way to its goal of 65,000 spectra to @xmath162 .    given the extreme demands that cross - correlation cosmography will place on the calibration of both the lensing distortion and photo-@xmath139 calibrations , there will be a significant advantage to space - based observations .",
    "ground - based analyses must deal with a constantly - varying psf and atmospheric transmission function which will make it more difficult to achieve these accurate calibrations .",
    "a space - based platform will have the additional advantages of thermal stability , a much sharper psf , and the possibility of using near - ir filter bands to improve the photo-@xmath139 accuracy .",
    "we have presented a formalism for implementing the idea of @xcite to constrain cosmology by tracing the dependence of induced distortion on background redshift for a fixed foreground mass template .",
    "cross - correlating the background distortion with a series of foreground mass templates has significant advantages over power - spectrum tomography , particularly its immunity to spurious distortion signals , and the ability to use non - linear lensing structures without having to model accurately the non - linear evolution of matter in the universe .",
    "we believe this formalism makes use of all the information available in all lens - source pairs in a nearly optimal fashion ; we find that a survey with median redshift @xmath163 and 100  galaxies per square arcminute can constrain the dark energy parameters to @xmath2 and @xmath3 after application of a practical prior on @xmath4 .",
    "realization of the full potential of the cross - correlation cosmography method will require that techniques for the calibration of lensing distortion and photometric redshift be improved by at least an order of magnitude from present state of the art .",
    "there are no known fundamental barriers to this , but it will not be easy .",
    "we discuss ways of fitting for parameters in the calibration from the data . to reduce possible biases in the photometric redshifts to an acceptable level",
    "would require spectroscopic redshifts for @xmath164 galaxies over the redshift range used in the analysis .",
    "an orbiting observatory may be preferred for obtaining the precision required for our method due to its greater photometric and optical stability , and access to the near infrared .",
    "the potential accuracy of cross - correlation cosmography on the equation - of - state time variation compares well to the expected precision of power - spectrum tomography .",
    "a formalism for full utilisation of the power - spectrum tomography information has not yet been published , and none of the few published investigations of the effects of time - dependent dark energy use for the equation of state .",
    "the assumed priors and confidence levels of published estimates also vary greatly , so only crude comparisons can be made .",
    "@xcite estimates an error of @xmath165 on @xmath166 from tomography confined to the linear regime .",
    "the plots of @xcite suggest @xmath167 from a non - tomographic analysis deep into the non - linear regime .",
    "it should ultimately be possible to use all the information encoded in the weak lensing ",
    "cosmography , growth function , and cross - correlation with foreground structures  to provide constraints stronger than those we forecast here . by cancelling the growth information ,",
    "however , we eliminate the systematic errors that might arise from mis - calculation of the theoretical non - linear spectrum , and from _ additive _ contamination of the distortion field by systematic effects .",
    "the penalty for cancelling the growth factor is that the signal is partially cancelled as well , leaving the cross - correlation method more susceptible to _ multiplicative , redshift - dependent _ errors in the distortion field that might arise from psf effects .",
    "further improvements to the cross - correlation cosmography methodology are worth investigation .",
    "the cosmic microwave background can serve as an additional source plane at @xmath168 , and its shear pattern can be cross - correlated with all the lens planes to provide a @xmath15 improvement and greater redshift leverage .",
    "one could also make use of magnification information as well as shear in the background galaxy samples , which would improve the @xmath15 and serve as a useful cross - check ( _ e.g. _  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , in this study we have not developed a detailed method to obtain template distortion maps from the foreground galaxy distribution . a detailed study that includes the redshift dependence of the fidelity of the template would be useful .",
