    "higher resolution images made by vlbi reveal the structure down to a scale of a few au @xcite .",
    "analysis of the 15  ghz vla - scale structure of the jets in ss433 , with angular resolution of about @xmath6 , was presented in @xcite .",
    "multi - epoch dual - frequency analysis of ss433 during the summer of 2003 will be presented in @xcite , hereafter paper  iii , and for the summer of 2007 in @xcite , hereafter paper  iv .    in this paper",
    "we use high dynamic range vla images of ss433 to study the radiative intensity of the two jets as a function of the material s _ birth epoch _ @xmath7 and _ age at emission _",
    "@xmath0 ( hereafter simply `` age '' ) ; see appendix  1 (  [ s : app1 ] ) for our definitions of these quantities .",
    "our goals are ( i ) to determine if the two jets are intrinsically the same , and ( ii ) to learn if the jets behave as individual non - interacting components or as a continuous stream .",
    "ss433 offers a unique opportunity to answer these questions because it presents two jets with ever - changing mildly - relativistic velocities known as functions of time and position on the sky from their optical properties . in ",
    "[ s : obs ] we describe the observations and data reduction . in  [ s : jets ] we determine the properties of the jets and we discuss the physical implications of these results in  [ s : discussion ] .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  [ s : conclude ] .",
    "interferometer data for 2003 july 11 ( jd 2452832 ) were obtained from the vla data archive .",
    "the array was in the a configuration with 27 working antennas .",
    "the frequency used was 4.86  ghz , with a bandwidth of 50  mhz for each of the two if systems .",
    "the data were edited and phase calibrated in aips @xcite using the nearby source 1922 + 155 , and amplitude calibrated against 3c48 ; the data",
    "were then imaged using the tasks imagr and calib , utilizing many cycles of phase and amplitude self - calibration .",
    "these data were previously used by @xcite to study the symmetries of the jets , and by @xcite to study the magnetic field configuration in the jets .",
    "[ fig : cun](a ) & ( b ) show the distribution of total intensity for ss433 , made with uniform weighting ( robust = @xmath8 ) ; this image has resolution of @xmath9 . the kinematic model without nutation or velocity variations",
    "is shown in ( a ) , and the model with nutation and velocity variations is shown in ( b ) . the kinematic model used to define the jet locus",
    "is described in appendix  1 , ",
    "[ s : app1 ] .",
    "a naturally weighted image with a resolution of @xmath10 ( robust = + 5 ) , shown in figure  [ fig : cna ] , reveals very low level emission out to distances of at least @xmath11 , corresponding to ages of about 800  days for both jets .",
    "for all of the analysis that follows we used the image shown fig.[fig : cun ] , and included the velocity variations and nutation .",
    "this accounts for the `` spiking '' apparent in many of the figures .",
    "uncertainty in the position of the model jet locus is by far the largest source of fluctuations in the total intensity curves ; the root - mean - square difference between profiles generated with and without these terms is about 1.5  mjy / beam . thermal noise is negligible until @xmath12 falls below about 0.1  mjy / beam .",
    "comparison of the images with the kinematic model shows them to be compatible , with the kinematic locus being the leading edge of the jets ; the source also contains significant off - jet material .",
    "we see no unambiguous evidence of either nutation or significant jet velocity variations , but this is not surprising given the limited resolution of the images .",
    "in order to study the intrinsic properties of the jets , we used the kinematic model to determine the effects on the observed jets of projection and doppler beaming . in",
    "what follows , we will present jet properties as functions of age @xmath0 instead of the birth epoch @xmath7 because we expect the aging of the jet material to be the most important factor determining its properties .",
    "figure  [ fig : ltt ] shows @xmath0 for both east and west jets as functions of @xmath7 , and it can be used to estimate @xmath0 at any location on the images , using the average proper motion of @xmath13 .",
    "projection effects were determined using model jets consisting of discrete components equally - spaced in birth epoch @xmath7 ; the projected density on the sky was determined by performing a beam - averaged count of the number of components per beam area as functions of position down the kinematic locus of the the two jets .",
    "this was normalized to unity at the core .",
    "the doppler factor @xmath14 of each component was found from the kinematic model , and doppler boosts calculated as @xmath15 , where a continuous jet has @xmath16 and an isolated component has @xmath17 ( see appendix  2 (  [ s : app2 ] ) ) , and @xmath18 is the spectral index of the jet ( @xmath19 ; paper  iii , paper  iv ) .",
    "the total normalization factors were obtained by performing a beam - weighted sum of the boosts as a function of position down the model jets ; all quantities were determined as functions of @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ fig : norm2 ] shows combined normalizations for the jets in ss433 , expressed as multiplicative factors to be applied to observed total intensities , as functions of @xmath0 , for @xmath20 .",
    "curves for @xmath17 are similar and not shown .",
    "data from figure  [ fig : norm2 ] will be used below to create model jet intensity curves .",
    "the ratio of the normalizations for the two values of @xmath21 ranges between 0.92 and 1.12 , sufficiently different from unity to distinguish the two in the regions @xmath22 where the jet flux is greatest .",
    "figure  [ fig : fun(age ) ] shows the profiles down the model locus of the observed total intensities of the jets derived from the image in figure  [ fig : cun ] and the naturally - weighted image in figure  [ fig : cna ] , as functions of @xmath0 . for the region",
    "@xmath23 , contamination by the core is less than 1% of the jet intensity in figure  [ fig : cun ] ; the beam occupies the first 75 days in figure  [ fig : cna ] .",
    "the loops in the curves for both jets are the result of the fact that material of multiple different birth epochs can have the same age as a result of differing light travel times .",
    "it is useful to know that the places along each jet where the radial velocity switches sign and the jet motions are both in the plane of the sky are located at @xmath24  days . at these ages",
    "the projection factors and doppler boots of the two jets are equal , so if the two jets are intrinsically the same , the raw total intensities should be the same .",
    "examination of the intensity curves shows that , allowing for the beams of full - width at half - maximum about @xmath25 for figure  [ fig : fun(age)](a ) and @xmath26 for figure  [ fig : fun(age)](b ) , this is satisfied .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig : f1f2(age ) ] , neither normalization for projection effects alone nor for doppler boosting alone results in east and west jets appearing the same .",
    "this is true for either choice of @xmath21 .",
    "figure  [ fig : normcun ] shows the intrinsic brightness profiles of the jets in ss433 created by normalizing for both projection effects and doppler boosting for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , as functions of @xmath0 , derived from the image in figure  [ fig : cun ] . especially in the case",
    "@xmath16 , the intrinsic brightnesses of the two jets are very similar when compared for equal ages . the small discrepancies between the derived intrinsic brightnesses of the east and west jets for @xmath16 in the range @xmath27 can be understood as artifacts due to the tight bend in the east jet at ra  @xmath28 and the first loop in the west jet , ra  @xmath29 ; these correspond to ages @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively . in the first range",
    "the measured total intensity for the east jet is artificially high , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : normcun](a ) , due to two parts of the jet locus being `` in the beam '' at the same time . in the second range , the total intensity of the west jet is falsely measured to be high , again corresponding to fig .  [ fig : normcun](a ) .",
    "the normalization process can not account for the contamination of one side of the loop by the part of the other that is in the same beam ( the procedure lacks _ a priori _ information about the ratio of the two contributions ) .",
    "this is minimal at the cusp of the loop , @xmath32 .",
    "however , when we reconstruct the west jet from the intrinsic brightness of the east jet and the normalization model this is accounted for , and the artifacts largely disappear ( see below ) . while the same arguments apply to @xmath17 , they can not account for the discrepancy over @xmath33 ; the agreement for @xmath17 is simply not as good where the jet is brightest , suggesting that @xmath16 .",
    "we can see the results of the normalizations in another way if we examine the total intensity ratio of the two jets .",
    "figure  [ fig : masterratiosplot ] shows the ratio of observed total intensities in the form east jet divided by west jet and the predicted ratios for complete correction for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , all as functions of @xmath0 .",
    "the fit of the combined normalization to the data is quite good for @xmath16 ; the prediction for @xmath17 is not as good a fit .",
    "in fact , the discrepancies between the data ratio and the @xmath16 model ratio are explained in the same way described above . in the range @xmath30 ,",
    "the east jet is measured to be artificially high , raising the measured ratio above the model ratio , in agreement with the figure ; in the range @xmath34 , the west jet is measured artificially high , producing the opposite effect , again in accord with the figure .",
    "we can test the similarity of the two jets in a third way , by using the derived intrinsic brightness of the east jet in figure  [ fig : normcun ] and the model normalization factors in figure  [ fig : norm2 ] to predict the observed total intensity of the west jet .",
    "comparisons for @xmath16 and @xmath17 are shown in figure  [ fig : recon1 ] for ages out to 350  days . in the region",
    "@xmath35  days the east jet is a single - valued function of age , so it can be modeled ( normalized ) uniquely , and the loops in the west jet reconstructed free of artifacts .",
    "the small uncertainties in the intrinsic brightness of the east jet described above produce small disagreements over @xmath36 , as expected . the overall fit is better for @xmath16 than for @xmath17 , also in agreement with the results above .",
    "because @xmath7 becomes a multiply - valued function of @xmath0 beyond ages of about @xmath37  days , it is not possible to reconstruct the west jet uniquely beyond this point .    finally , if we regard @xmath21 simply as a phenomenological parameter , examination of figs .",
    "[ fig : normcun][fig : recon1 ] shows that @xmath16 is favored over @xmath17 because agreement of the intrinsic brightness of the two jets where they are brightest is superior .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that _ in ss433 jets the observed total intensities are compatible with the twin jets being intrinsically identical , and behaving as continuous jets .",
    "_ we address the question of the expected behavior of the observed total intensity on the doppler boosts in appendix  2 (  [ s : app2 ] ) .",
    "three interesting questions about the jets are : ( i ) do they contain features , such as breaks or peaks in the intensity profiles in either or both jets that are not the effect of projection and doppler boosting on an otherwise smooth intensity distribution , ( ii ) if so , are they the same in the two jets , and ( iii ) if so , how do they behave in time .",
    "such features might arise at the ejection of the jets ( the core after all is quite variable ; paper  iii ) , or as functions of their aging and/or propagation .",
    "figure  [ fig : f12(t ) ] shows the intrinsic brightness for @xmath16 and @xmath17 as a function of birth epoch . because this compares east and west jet material of different ages there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect matching features",
    ". however , the regions of roughly constant brightness located over the range @xmath38 in both jets may be such features because we see the same behavior over the entire summers of 2003 ( paper iii ) and 2007 ( paper  iv ) , but at different age ranges .",
    "thus the flattening of the decay curve may be the result of variations in the central engine .",
    "comparison of the two jets is hindered by our inability to extract unique properties of the west jet through the first tight loop .",
    "nonetheless , what does seem clear is that after the initial rapid falloff of each jet , there is a leveling - off , and then a somewhat slower decline with large observational uncertainties .    assuming that the jets are dominated by aging rather than by variability in ejection properties , we can parameterize the physical processes that govern these different time ranges by fitting the normalized intensity curves with linear , exponential , and power law models .",
    "figure  [ fig : norm12linearfits ] shows fits to the intrinsic brightness @xmath39 of the jets for @xmath16 over the range @xmath40 days .",
    "exponential fits of the form @xmath41 yield half - lives of @xmath42  days and 39  days for the east and west jets , respectively .",
    "linear fits , while unrealistic for an entire jet , give half - lives of @xmath43 of 46  days and 40  days , and power law fits yield exponents of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , for the east and west jets , respectively . reassuringly , these timescales are very similar to the results of multi - epoch imaging that follows the aging of specific pieces of the jet ( paper  iii , paper  iv ) .",
    "the root - mean - square deviations of the exponential fits of @xmath46 for the east jet and west jet are 1.0  mjy / beam and 0.8  mjy / beam , which suggests that a reasonable lower limit to the uncertainties in the total intensity curves is about 1  mjy / beam , comparable to the difference between using model curves with and without nutation and velocity variations (  [ s : obs ] ) . given the limited span of these data , we are unable to distinguish definitively among these models ; the exponentials appear superior , but this is not statistically significant .    for constant speed , as in ss433 , models that predict intensity behavior with distance",
    "should be compared to data fit in age .",
    "the model of a freely - expanding spherical cloud of magnetized relativistic plasma @xcite , which might be appropriate if the pieces of the jet behave as discrete non - interacting components , predicts that in the optically - thin regime the resulting synchrotron total intensity falls off as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the electron energy distribution exponent .",
    "since here @xmath49 , this predicts a decay with a power law in component radius of index @xmath50 . were the components freely expanding we would have @xmath51 , which would then be ruled out by the data . in the conical jet model of @xcite ,",
    "the intensity of the jet falls off as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is distance down the jet , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 correspond to freely - expanding and slowed expansion cases , respectively . for @xmath57",
    ", @xmath55 corresponds to @xmath58 , and @xmath56 to @xmath59 .",
    "power fits to our data in this age range lie between the two cases .",
    "we also fit exponentials and power laws to the data for @xmath60 , and find for both jets @xmath61 or @xmath62 where @xmath63 , marginally incompatible with the freely expanding sphere model .",
    "the principal results in this paper are :    1 .",
    "we have used a deep vla a - array image of ss433 at 4.86  ghz to study the intrinsic brightness profiles of the twin jets .",
    "radiation from both jets is detected out to at least @xmath11 from the core , corresponding to jet ages of about 800  days .",
    "the observed brightnesses of the jets are strongly affected by projection effects and doppler boosting .",
    "intrinsically the two jets are remarkably similar , and they are best described by doppler boosting of the form @xmath1 , as expected for a continuous jet .",
    "the intrinsic brightness of the jets behaves in a complex way that is not well described by single linear , exponential , or power law decay .",
    "6 .   during their first @xmath64150  days , the jet decays are well represented by linear or exponential functions of age , with linear half - lives or exponential half - lives of about 40  days , the same for the two jets .",
    "power law fits to the data in this age range give exponents of about @xmath45 .",
    "there is a transition region , corresponding to jet ages between about 150 and 250  days , during which the jets maintain roughly constant intrinsic brightnesses .",
    "this represents nearly one complete precession period .",
    "this also corresponds to about @xmath65 in either jet .",
    ".   at later times the jet decay can be roughly fit as exponential functions of age , with exponential half - lives of about 80  days , or as power laws with indices of @xmath62 .",

    "finally , we thank the referee for a number of comments and questions that led to significant improvements and clarifications .",
    "we used the geometric model of @xcite , the precession parameters of @xcite , and the distance of @xcite , augmented with jet velocity variations following @xcite and nutation following @xcite , to determine the locus and kinematic properties of the jets and their appearance on the sky .",
    "the ephemeris used is listed in table  [ tab : ephem ] .",
    "our convention for labeling a piece of jet that we see at a certain spot on the sky is as follows : we define its _ birth epoch _ @xmath7 as the time elapsed in the frame of the core since the material was born ( ejected ) .",
    "thus @xmath7 serves to label specific pieces of the jets .",
    "we also define its _ age at emission _",
    "@xmath0 as the age of the same piece of material at the moment it emitted the photons that we detect at the same time as photons from the rest of the source .",
    "due to the finite speed of light , material that is `` behind '' the core and moving away from us had to emit its photons at a younger age in order that they arrive at the observer at the same time as photons from the core , and the reverse for matter `` in front . ''",
    "this means that oncoming material has @xmath66 , receding material the opposite . in this convention ,",
    "the core has @xmath67 , material with larger @xmath7 was born earlier than material with smaller @xmath7 , material with larger @xmath0 emitted its photons at an older age than did material with smaller @xmath0 , and material moving in the plane of the sky has @xmath68 .",
    "quantitatively , birth epoch @xmath7 and age at emission @xmath0 are related by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the component of material s velocity that is directed toward the observer . in ss433 , each jet has pieces with both positive and negative @xmath70 , as illustrated in figures  [ fig : cun ] and [ fig : cna ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : ltt ] illustrates the light travel time effects in ss433 .",
    "it shows the age at time of emission of photons @xmath0 for each part of the east and west jets , as a function of the birth epoch @xmath7 of each part of the jets . in the parts of the jets that are sufficiently bright that we can see them , the time differences @xmath71 range up to @xmath72  days , grow with distance from the core , produce the well - known distortion of the appearance of the jets , and affect our analysis .",
    "note that at most places along the jets , the differences between @xmath7 and @xmath0 for the two jets are not equal for a given value of @xmath7 .",
    "here we address the question of why the jets behave such that their observed brightnesses vary as @xmath1 rather than @xmath73 , as might be expected for isolated individual components such as those seen in vlbi imaging .",
    "there are four issues that should not be confused .",
    "( 1 ) are the jets a series of isolated components or a continuous fluid flow ? ( 2 ) for these two cases , how does the observed total intensity depend on doppler boosting in a jet whose locus is a helix but whose motion is radial ? ( 3 ) under what conditions can observations distinguish the the cases @xmath16 and @xmath17 ?",
    "( 4 ) what do the data say about the ss433 jets ?",
    "a moving optically - thin synchrotron source is doppler boosted and k - corrected by a factor of @xmath73 because @xmath74 is a lorentz invariant and @xmath75 @xcite . in the case of a continuous jet",
    "we want to know the flux density of a segment of the jet defined by the observing beam .",
    "as shown by @xcite , and others , not all the material in that segment of jet at a given instant contributes to a particular image .",
    "this is purely a light travel time effect .",
    "the fraction of the jet segment that contributes is @xmath76 .",
    "the effect of this is that the boost factor is modified from @xmath73 to @xmath77 ; in other words , @xmath78 .",
    "this calculation assumes a straight jet with the velocity along the jet direction .    in ss433 the locus of the jet is a helix even though the motion of the jet material is radial",
    "this means that the time delay between the arrival of photons from the near and far ends of the jet is no longer @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the length of the part of the jet defined by the beam and @xmath81 is the angle between the jet velocity and the line of sight .",
    "instead , it is @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the angle between the tangent to the jet locus and the line of sight .",
    "in addition , the rate at which material is added to the observed part of the jet is no longer proportional to @xmath84 , but is instead determined by the component of the jet velocity in the direction of the locus of the helix .",
    "we have made such calculations using the known kinematics of each part of the jet , and the results are very similar to the continuous straight jet case , that is , with effective boosts of approximately @xmath1 , as observed .",
    "critical to this analysis is the fact that the lorentz factors of each part of the jets are the same .",
    "if the jets are each a series of components , then whether the total intensity is boosted by @xmath1 or @xmath73 depends on the spacing of the components relative to the spatial scale of the resolution of the imaging . if the components are sufficiently close , then there are always components that do not appear in the beam but belong there , and components that appear there but are not , just as for a continuous fluid flow , and @xmath1 is appropriate . if the spacing is so great that during the light travel time from the back of the jet to the front no component moves into or out of the beam , then @xmath73 is appropriate .",
    "however , depending on the properties of the components and the angular resolution of the observation , any value between @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be appropriate .",
    "for the current observation , the data strongly suggest that @xmath16 for ss433 , indicating that the jets are either continuous , or if composed of discrete components , then there are many in the beam at any time .",

    "<S> the intrinsic brightness of the jets as a function of age at emission of the jet material @xmath0 is recovered by removal of the doppler boosting and projection effects . </S>",
    "<S> we find that intrinsically the two jets are remarkably similar when compared for equal @xmath0 , and that they are best described by doppler boosting of the form @xmath1 , as expected for continuous jets . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic brightnesses of the jets as functions of age behave in complex ways . in the age range @xmath2  </S>",
    "<S> days , the jet decays are best represented by exponential functions of @xmath0 , but linear or power law functions are not statistically excluded . </S>",
    "<S> this is followed by a region out to @xmath3  days during which the intrinsic brightness is essentially constant . at later times </S>",
    "<S> the jet decay can be fit roughly as exponential or power law functions of @xmath0 . </S>"
