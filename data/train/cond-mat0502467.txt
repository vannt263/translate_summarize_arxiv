    "one of the unusual characteristics of the cuprate superconductors is the relative insensitivity of the superconducting properties to the presence of magnetic rare - earth ions . in the _ r_ba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 family ( _ r _ = y or rare earth )",
    "superconductivity occurs at temperatures as high as 95k , and magnetic ordering of the _ r _ sublattice generally coexists with superconductivity at temperatures around 2k or below.@xcite antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering of the bilayer cu spins is observed in non - superconducting samples with low oxygen doping levels ( typically @xmath10 ) , but superconducting samples do not exhibit any conventional form of cu magnetic order.@xcite    a striking exception to this norm is the case of prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( hereafter prbco6+@xmath11 ) , which exhibits anomalous electrical and magnetic properties in comparison to other _",

    "unusual magnetic structures are observed below @xmath13 due to magnetic coupling between the cu and pr sublattices.@xcite    many of these anomalous features of prbco6+@xmath11 remain a puzzle .",
    "models for the electronic structure have indicated a tendency for pr 4@xmath16  o 2@xmath17 hybridization to cause a localization of doped holes in o 2@xmath18 orbitals , thus inhibiting superconductivity.@xcite such hybridization would also be expected to influence the magnetic couplings in prbco6+@xmath11 , and so measurements of the exchange interactions could yield information on the underlying electronic structure .    over a number of years",
    "we have undertaken a systematic investigation of the magnetic excitations of prbco6+@xmath11 by neutron inelastic scattering.@xcite the aim has been to identify the important magnetic couplings and to see how they vary with doping .",
    "broadly speaking , the magnetic excitations fall into two categories : ( i ) transitions between levels of the pr 4@xmath16 electrons split by the local crystalline electric field ( cef),@xcite and ( ii ) cu spin wave excitations .",
    "there are also non - trivial effects on the excitations due to the magnetic coupling between the pr and cu sub - systems.@xcite    in our most recent work we have investigated the wavevector dependence of the magnetic excitations using a single crystal sample of prbco6+@xmath11 prepared first in an oxygen - deficient state ( @xmath19 ) and later treated to produce an ` optimally - doped ' oxygen content ( @xmath20 )",

    "here we report measurements of the cu spin excitations at higher energies ( 50150mev ) by time - of - flight neutron scattering .",
    "we determine the principal intra- and inter - layer cu  cu exchange interactions @xmath5 and @xmath6 in prbco6+@xmath11 and make a comparison with the corresponding parameters in ybco6+@xmath11 .",
    "perhaps the most interesting new finding is that @xmath5 and @xmath6 in prbco6+@xmath11 are independent of oxygen doping .",
    "the experiments were performed on the same single crystal of prbco6+@xmath11 as used for the measurements described in refs . and , and also for the phonon study reported in ref . .",
    "the as - grown crystal had a mass of 2 g , and a mosaic spread of approximately 1deg ( full width at half maximum ) measured by neutron diffraction .",
    "the crystal was subjected to two annealing treatments to control the oxygen content .",
    "first , the as - grown crystal was reduced at 700@xmath22c in a flow of 99.998% argon for 100h and quenched to room temperature .",
    "after the measurements on this ` under - doped ' crystal had been completed the crystal was then annealed in pure oxygen over a period of 60 days while cooling in steps from 600@xmath22c to 450@xmath22c , with progressively longer dwell times at each step as the temperature decreased . after the second anneal",
    "the mosaic of the crystal was found to have increased to approximately 3deg .    according to studies of oxygen content in ybco6+@xmath11 as a function of annealing conditions ( oxygen partial pressure and temperature ) the two treatments applied here yield oxygen contents of @xmath23 and @xmath24.@xcite although the oxygen ordering properties of ybco6+@xmath11 and prbco6+@xmath11 are qualitatively different their oxygen equilibrium isobar coincides at 0.21 atm up to 650@xmath22c.@xcite therefore it is realistic to assume that this is also the case for other oxygen partial pressures . however , as a further check of the oxygen content we measured the magnetic ordering behaviour of the crystal after each anneal by neutron diffraction .",
    "studies carried out on polycrystalline prbco6+@xmath11 have shown by various techniques@xcite that the pr magnetic ordering temperature increases from @xmath25k for vacuum - annealed samples ( @xmath26 ) , to @xmath27k for ` optimally - doped ' material ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the results for our crystal are illustrated in fig.[fig:0 ] , which shows the temperature dependence of the @xmath29 bragg reflection whose appearance is known to signal the onset of pr magnetic order.@xcite the pr ordering temperatures are determined to be @xmath30k after reduction , and @xmath31k after oxygen annealing .",
    "these values are consistent with the literature results for the expected oxygen contents @xmath32 and @xmath24 , respectively , and we will henceforth refer to the crystals as prbco6.2 and prbco6.93 .",
    "the sharpness of the transitions indicates a homogeneous oxygen distribution .",
    "the @xmath33 intensity curve for prbco6.93 also shows an anomaly at @xmath34 .",
    "this is consistent with a spin transition first observed by uma _ et al_.,@xcite which corresponds to a change in the @xmath35 axis stacking sequence of the coupled pr ",

    "maps and het are time - of - flight spectrometers equipped with pixellated area detectors situated 6 m ( maps ) and 4 m ( het ) from the sample position , and an incident beam divergence of approximately 0.5@xmath36 . these design features ensure very good wavevector ( * q * ) resolution , an essential experimental requirement in this work because of the very steep cu spin wave dispersion .",
    "the crystal was aligned with the c axis approximately parallel to the incident neutron beam direction .",
    "this arrangement means ( i ) that the surfaces in * q * space corresponding to constant neutron energy transfer are approximately parallel to the @xmath37 plane in the reciprocal lattice of the crystal , and ( ii ) that the component of * q * parallel to @xmath38 varies with energy transfer .",
    "the natural way to visualize the data is then to integrate the signal recorded in each pixel of the detector bank over a band of energies and project the results on to the @xmath37 plane .",
    "measurements were performed with fixed incident neutron energies of 80mev , 200mev and 300mev on maps , and 200mev on het .",
    "most of the data were collected with the crystal at a temperature of 20k , but some runs were repeated at 300k .",
    "the runs on maps were of 23 days duration , and the runs on het were of 5 days duration for each of 2 settings of the crystal .",
    "these run times are given for an average proton current of 160@xmath39a . in principle , the range of incident energies employed on maps allowed us to study the spin excitations up to @xmath40mev , which is the anticipated maximum in the one - magnon spectrum ( see later ) .",
    "however , owing to the relatively small size of the crystal the count rate was too low to obtain statistically meaningful data above 150mev .",
    "the intensity was converted into an absolute cross section by comparison with the scattering from a standard sample of vanadium.@xcite the presented spectra are the partial differential cross section @xmath41 per formula unit ( f.u . ) multiplied by the factor @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the initial and final neutron wavevectors , and @xmath45 is the final energy.@xcite",

    "this is the well known afi structure , the same as found in underdoped ybco6+@xmath11 .",

    "each scan contains two peaks , one for each intersection of the scan with the spin wave dispersion surface which we assume to be a ring . by fitting a pair of gaussian functions on a sloping background to the peaks in these and similar scans in other directions and from other runs , allowing for the curvature of the dispersion surface over the averaging width @xmath71",

    "the points corresponding to mainly acoustic modes and mainly optic modes are shown with different symbols on fig.[fig:4 ] , and we have also included the optic mode gap at the afm zone centre ( @xmath73mev ) determined in a previous measurement on the same prbco6.2 crystal.@xcite    the magnon dispersion data were compared with the curves for the acoustic and optic spin wave branches calculated from eqs.[eq:2 ] and [ eq:3 ] .",

    "the data collected on oxygenated prbco6.93 were more limited than those just described for prbco6.2 .",
    "this is because the detector area on het is considerably smaller than on maps , which restricted the measurement to one brillouin zone and required two slightly different settings of the crystal to cover enough of the zone to include all the signal .",

    "[ fig:3](b ) shows a cut through the antiferromagnetic point @xmath76 parallel to @xmath77 .",

    "experiment@xcite we determined the optic mode gap for prbco6.93 and found it to be @xmath79mev , again consistent with that for prbco6.2 .",
    "at the start of this work we set out to determine the cu  cu exchange parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 for prbco6+@xmath11 and to compare them with the corresponding parameters for ybco6+@xmath11 .",
    "the result @xmath74mev for the intra - layer exchange parameter of prbco6.2 found here is the same to within experimental error as the values @xmath80mev@xcite and @xmath81mev@xcite determined by neutron inelastic scattering for ybco6.15 .",
    "there is also good agreement with the values @xmath82mev for prbco6+@xmath11 ( @xmath83 ) , ref .  , and @xmath84mev for ybco6+@xmath11 ( @xmath26 ) , ref .  ,",
    "derived from two - magnon raman scattering , which provides some support for the models used to describe the rather broad two - magnon raman spectra .    on the other hand ,",
    "the values of the inter - layer exchange parameter for prbco6+@xmath11 and ybco6+@xmath11 are significantly different .",
    "we obtain @xmath85mev for prbco6.2 , compared with @xmath86mev for ybco6.2 ( ref . ) and @xmath87mev for ybco6.15 ( ref .  ) .",
    "our own measurements on a crystal of ybco6.2 gave @xmath88mev .",
    "one factor that might influence @xmath6 is the inter - layer separation , which is about 4% larger in prbco6+@xmath11 than in ybco6+@xmath11 reflecting the larger size of the pr@xmath89 ion relative to y@xmath89 .",
    "it would be surprising , however , if this accounts for a factor 2 difference in @xmath6 between prbco and ybco .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , it has been proposed that superconductivity is suppressed in prbco because holes become localized in hybridized pr ",
    "o bonds@xcite .",
    "naively , one might expect such a change in the electronic structure to have an influence on the cu  cu exchange interactions .",
    "the invariance of @xmath5 to the replacement of y by pr implies that the in - plane afm superexchange interaction is unaffected by any changes in the electronic structure associated with pr 4@xmath16  o 2@xmath17 hydridization .",
    "this does not present any obvious difficulties since the superexchange is mediated by the o 2@xmath90 orbitals which lie in the layers , whereas the proposed hybridization scheme@xcite involves o 2@xmath18 orbitals which are oriented perpendicular to the layers .",
    "following the same reasoning , it is tempting to connect the large difference in @xmath6 between prbco and ybco as evidence for hybridization - induced changes in the electronic structure within the bilayer .",
    "however , if the @xmath6 exchange were mediated by hybridized pr  o bonds that also accommodate doped holes then it is difficult to explain the apparent insensitivity of @xmath6 to doping .",
    "a fuller analysis of these observations will require a proper understanding of the mechanism for the inter - layer exchange in the bilayer cuprates .",
    "what we can say , though , is that the substitution of y by pr does have a very significant influence on the inter - layer coupling .    before concluding it is worth mentioning that although we have found no difference between the spin wave spectrum of prbco6.2 and prbco6.93 below 100mev , there may still be differences at higher energies",
    "indeed , the two - magnon raman peak , which is sensitive to short wavevelength spin fluctuations , was found shifted to lower energies in spectra from prbco7 compared with prbco6 , @xcite leading to a significantly smaller value @xmath91mev than obtained from our neutron scattering measurements .",
    "one explanation for this apparent discrepancy could be that the magnetic excitations in hole - doped prbco may be influenced by magnon ",
    "hole interactions at higher energies .",
    "neutron scattering measurements of the magnetic excitations up to the one - magnon zone boundary could therefore be very interesting .",
    "in this work we have shown that the cu spin excitation spectrum in prbco is well described up to @xmath92150mev by the spin wave model for a bilayer antiferromagnet . in this",
    "energy range the spin excitations do not change with doping .",
    "the in - plane superexchange parameter @xmath5 has the same value in undoped prbco as in undoped ybco , whereas the inter - layer exchange parameter @xmath6 is a factor of 2 smaller in prbco than in ybco .",
    "an understanding of these results could provide useful insight into the differences between the electronic structure of prbco and ybco , and hence into the question of why ybco has a superconducting ground state whereas prbco does not .",
