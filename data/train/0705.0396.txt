    "<S> we identify the class of @xmath0 dark energy models which have a viable cosmology , i.e. a matter dominated epoch followed by a late - time acceleration . the deviation from a @xmath1cdm model ( @xmath2 ) is quantified by the function @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the matter epoch corresponds to @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 ) while the accelerated attractor exists in the region @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the equation of state @xmath7 of all such `` viable '' @xmath0 models exhibits two features : @xmath7 diverges at some redshift @xmath8 and crosses the cosmological constant boundary ( `` phantom crossing '' ) at a redshift @xmath9 smaller than @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> using the observational data of supernova ia and cosmic microwave background , we obtain the constraint @xmath10 and we find that the phantom crossing could occur at @xmath11 , i.e. within reach of observations . </S>",
    "<S> if we add local gravity constraints , the bound on @xmath12 becomes very stringent , with @xmath12 several orders of magnitude smaller than unity in the region whose density is much larger than the present cosmological density . </S>",
    "<S> the representative models that satisfy both cosmological and local gravity constraints take the asymptotic form @xmath13 with @xmath14 as @xmath15 approaches @xmath16 . </S>"
