    "intermediate polars ( ips ) have been the focus of numerous studies since they first emerged as a separate class of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) .",
    "possessing observational characteristics of both dwarf novae and magnetic cataclysmic variables , the current model for intermediate polars paints them as a fusion of these two types of systems .",
    "an asynchronously rotating magnetic white dwarf primary accretes magneto - hydrodynamically controlled material from a truncated accretion disk which is fed via an accretion stream by a red dwarf secondary star @xcite .",
    "the magnetically controlled accretion produces observational properties similar to those of a polar , while the visible accretion disk creates its signature double peaked spectral lines and other typical cv properties .",
    "the different components of the intermediate polar system : the secondary star , accretion stream , accretion disk , accretion region on the white dwarf surface , and the white dwarf itself , separately dominate in wavelength regions ranging from infrared to x - ray .",
    "while this makes ips very complicated objects to study , it also provides the opportunity to examine a multitude of astrophysical phenomena : from hot plasmas and accretion processes in the presence of high gravity and temperature to stellar astrophysics and binary evolution .",
    "an opportunity for an in - depth observational study of an intermediate polar arose when we were awarded one million seconds of time on the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer satellite _ ( _ euve _ ) to observe ex hydrae . in collaboration with other researchers",
    ", we used a number of other satellites to obtain simultaneous observations during the _ euve _ observation .",
    "x - ray data were obtained with _",
    "chandra _ ( spectroscopy ) , the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ , spectroscopy and photometry ) , and the unconventional stellar aspect ( usa ) experiment ( photometry ) . along with _ euve _",
    ", ultraviolet data were taken with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explore _",
    "( _ fuse _ , spectroscopy ) and the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ , spectroscopy ) .",
    "several ground based observatories were used to obtain optical data : apache point observatory ( apo , spectroscopy ) , rosemary hill observatory ( rho , photometry ) , and braeside observatory ( bo , photometry ) .",
    "infrared spectra were obtained at the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) .",
    "this paper is the first in a series which will detail the observations obtained during our campaign .",
    "ex hya has been the object of many previous observational studies for two main reasons : it is very bright ( @xmath2 ) and , with an inclination of @xmath3 @xcite , ex hya is one of only two x - ray eclipsing intermediate polars ( the other is xy ari , hellier 1997 ) .",
    "however , some difficulties arise when interpreting observational data due to the fact that the relatively long white dwarf spin period of @xmath4 minutes is roughly two - thirds that of the relatively short binary orbital period of @xmath5 minutes @xcite . masses for the white dwarf in ex hya have been determined using various methods and have yielded a range of values : measurements of the accretion stream shock height and temperature give @xmath6 @xcite , radial velocities derived from optical time resolved spectra have led to slightly higher values for the white dwarf mass , @xmath7 @xcite , and a mass as high as @xmath8 has been calculated using binary star parameters @xcite .",
    "the accretion curtain theory of ips , developed from high energy studies , suggests that modulation observed on the white dwarf spin period is due to varying optical depths through curtains of accreting material along our line of sight to the emission regions .",
    "however , according to recent x - ray observations @xcite , it is more likely that photoelectric absorption combines with an occultation of one of the accretion poles to give the observed spin modulation .",
    "maximum ( minimum ) of the spin phase in ex hya occurs when the upper magnetic pole points away from ( toward ) the observer .",
    "prior to this campaign , the most detailed euv study of ex hya was that performed by @xcite , who obtained 180 ks of data with the _ euve _ satellite .",
    "they found the spin phased light curve to be sinusoidal in shape and modulated by a factor of @xmath9 , with a maximum count rate of @xmath10 occurring at @xmath11 .",
    "the binary phased light curve exhibits a bulge eclipse which extends over @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this bulge eclipse has a non - zero flux , being @xmath13 of the non - bulge eclipsed flux averaged over the white dwarf spin phases , and has an intrinsic column density determined to be @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "there is also a feature attributed to an eclipse by the secondary star at @xmath15 @xcite with a centroid which remains constant to within @xmath16 s for all white dwarf phases implying an emission region located within @xmath17 of the white dwarf .",
    "the ingress and egress times of the secondary eclipse were used to constrain the euv emitting region size to be @xmath18 at 68% confidence @xcite .",
    "the euv spectra presented in @xcite contain highly ionized iron and neon emission lines which are indicative of a @xmath19 k plasma and a volume emission measure of @xmath20 . using the volume emission measure and the characteristic cooling time for a @xmath19 k plasma",
    ", they determined the accretion rate onto the white dwarf to be @xmath21 .",
    "ex hya was observed with the _ euve _ deep survey ( ds ; @xmath22 ) instrument and short wavelength spectrometer ( sw ; @xmath23 , @xmath24 , bowyer 1995 ) continuously for six weeks from 2000 may 5 - june 10 , totaling approximately one million seconds of on target time given a @xmath25 duty cycle . in spite of two safe holds caused by a battery failure and very high he ii @xmath26airglow , the data quality is very good . about @xmath27 of the ds photometer data and a bit less of the sw spectrometer data",
    "were rejected during periods of high background / airglow since the deadtime corrections became very large ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "typical ds deadtime corrections for the remaining data were around @xmath29 ( i.e. , the detector was too busy to process new photons @xmath30 of the time ) .",
    "two types of products were produced : ds light curves and sw spectrometer spectra , and each is discussed below in detail .",
    "photometry was performed from the ds images using a circular region of radius 13 pixels centered on the source and an annular background region with an inner radius of 50 pixels and outer radius of 100 pixels ( 1 pixel = @xmath31 , sirk et al .",
    "the photon counts were then binned on a time interval of 10 seconds and barycentric corrections were applied to the mid - time of each bin . from this photometric data set , phase folded light curves were created for the binary period , the white dwarf spin period , and for a few combinations of these two periods ( see  [ complcs ] ) .",
    "figure [ splc ] shows the _ euve _ photometric data folded on the white dwarf spin ephemeris , @xmath32 @xcite , while figure [ bplc ] presents the _ euve _ photometric data folded on the binary ephemeris , @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the binary ephemeris phase zero is based on optical binary eclipse timings , while spin phase zero is based on optical spin maxima timings .",
    "we will denote the spin phase as @xmath34 and the binary phase as @xmath35 .",
    "the spin phased light curve ( figure [ splc ] ) , with resolution @xmath36 or @xmath37 s , can be fit with the sinusoidal function , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 counts s@xmath40 , @xmath41 counts s@xmath40 , and @xmath42 .",
    "maximum occurs at @xmath43 and minimum occurs at @xmath44 ; both values differ from the expected values of @xmath45 ( maximum ) and @xmath46 ( minimum ) , and the maximum phase also differs from a previously determined value of @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the shift in maximum phase is real as the errors quoted for the spin ephemeris and period @xcite combine to give an expected error of @xmath48 within the light curve ; indicating a possible change in accretion geometry .",
    "the count rate at spin maximum is @xmath49 the spin minimum count rate ; the non - zero minimum count rate value ( @xmath50 ) implies that either part of the euv emitting region is still in view during the minimum phases , or that there is euv flux within the binary system not confined to a small occulted region .",
    "two theories have been advanced to explain the spin modulation in intermediate polars : absorption by an accretion curtain @xcite and occultation of the euv emitting region by the white dwarf @xcite . while both theories often seem to explain the observed phenomena in different ips , the euv flux in ex hya at minimum is less than half that at maximum , suggesting that if one of the poles is occulted , the other may be partially absorbed or the poles may have very different magnetic field strengths ( which could manifest as accretion poles with different temperatures . ) for reference , we refer to phases @xmath51 as spin maximum , phases @xmath52 correspond to spin decline , phases @xmath53 are spin minimum , and phases @xmath54 are spin rise , as illustrated in figure [ splc ] .",
    "euv modulation seen in the binary light curve ( figure [ bplc ] , with resolution @xmath55 or @xmath56 s ) is the result of the inclination angle of ex hya , rather than emission over the binary orbit .",
    "the fluctuations and dips seen throughout the light curve are due to eclipses of varying natures ; the large broad dip , or bulge dip , centered at @xmath57 , is caused by an increase in optical depth along our line of sight to the euv emitting region as viewed through the bulge created by the impact of the accretion stream with the outer edge of the accretion disk .",
    "the temporal extent of this dip , from @xmath58 , implies that the bulge physically extends over half of the accretion disk .",
    "the dip at @xmath59 has generally been attributed to an eclipse of the euv emitting region by the white dwarf , while the dip at @xmath60 has not been observed before in euv or other high energy photometry of ex hya ( e.g. , rosen et al .",
    "1991 ; hurwitz et al .",
    "1997 ; mauche 1999 ) .      to extract the _ euve _ sw spectra , a spectral region 13 pixels tall centered on the spectrum , and two background strips each 100 pixels tall were chosen",
    "( 1 pixel = @xmath61 , abbott et al .",
    "the background spectrum was fit with a smooth legendre polynomial before subtracting .",
    "utilizing this method ensures that no additional poisson noise is added to the spectrum @xcite .",
    "spectra were created for a variety of binary and white dwarf spin phases .",
    "figure [ spec ] presents spin phased spectra , but see figure 2 of belle , howell , & sirk ( 2002b ) for binary phased spectra .",
    "the euv spectra presented here are not significantly better in signal - to - noise per spectrum than those presented in @xcite , even though our observations were @xmath62 longer .",
    "assuming equal background levels during both observations , the signal - to - noise ratio in each of our _ four _ phase bins should be roughly @xmath63 greater than the signal - to - noise ratio in each of the two phase bins shown in @xcite . however , due to higher solar activity during our observations which increased the _",
    "euve _ background level ,",
    "the gain in signal - to - noise per spectrum is marginal .",
    "the spin maximum spectrum exhibits the greatest flux , both in the continuum and emission lines , while the spin minimum spectrum has a continuum level consistent with zero .",
    "the spin decline and spin rise spectra have average flux levels that are roughly equal to each other , in between the flux levels of the spin maximum and spin minimum spectra .",
    "discerning between a continuum level and a forest of low signal - to - noise emission lines is difficult for these spectra , thus we only identify lines as probable that extend above the @xmath64 error level ( adopting a @xmath65 criterion for the lines virtually rules out all line detections . )",
    "table [ t2 ] gives the observed wavelengths , fluxes , and the log of the temperature at which the emission line has its greatest power ( @xmath66 ) for the @xmath64 lines identified in the four spin phased spectra along with a few other unblended lines which are used for density determinations ( see  [ sect_spec ] ) .",
    "gaussians were fit to the emission lines in order to determine line parameters and the continuum was taken to be zero in each of the four spectra .",
    "the error reported for each @xmath67 measurement is a @xmath68 error and does not include the rms error of the sw spectrometer , @xmath69 . to aid us in the selection of lines , each listed line was also identified in the summed spectrum .",
    "the sw spectrometer has a moderate wavelength resolution of 0.5 , causing many of the emission lines to be blended together",
    ". for the lines we believe are blended , both lines are listed in table [ t2 ] for the identification at a single wavelength measurement .",
    "emission lines appearing in the euv spectra of ex hya are due to highly ionized iron and neon and have formation temperatures of @xmath70 k.",
    "the exact interpretation of the phenomena present in the euv binary light curve of ex hya is dependent upon the accuracy of the binary ephemeris .",
    "previous euv and high energy binary light curves of ex hya have shown a dip at @xmath59 ( or @xmath71 , mukai et al .",
    "1998 ) which has been attributed to a stellar eclipse of the euv emitting region or white dwarf @xcite . however , there is no direct evidence for a stellar nature of this dip , other than the dip occurs _",
    "close _ to the expected phase of @xmath72 . with a new dip appearing at @xmath60 , similar in nature to the @xmath59 dip , we are lead to question which , if any , dip is stellar in nature",
    ", what could be the cause of a non - stellar dip , and why the dip at @xmath60 has not been observed before .",
    "the binary phasing , @xmath73 , first determined by @xcite ( ephemeris constants were updated by hellier & sproats 1992 ) , and still used today , is based on @xmath74 and @xmath75 optical light photometric eclipse timings .",
    "we note that the error reported in the @xcite phasing propagates to only @xmath76 today .",
    "photometric eclipses seen in optical light in cataclysmic variables with accretion disks are often due to eclipses of the hot spot by the secondary star . the optical eclipse depth in ex hya",
    "was seen to be shallow and variable over time @xcite and during outburst becomes broad and shallow @xcite implying that the accretion disk is eclipsed rather than the white dwarf .",
    "thus , photometric phase zero according to the @xcite binary ephemeris for ex hya is likely to be a hot spot eclipse and not true binary zero ( i.e. , inferior conjunction of the secondary star ) .",
    "how does the binary ephemeris photometric phase zero compare with spectroscopic phase zero and true binary zero ?",
    "a stellar eclipse of the hot spot ( or bulge ) denotes photometric phase zero , while spectroscopic phase zero is taken to occur at the red - to - blue crossing of the optical emission line radial velocity curve ; the latter theoretically occurring at inferior conjunction of the secondary star .",
    "however , due to a bias in the ( disk ) emission lines from the hot spot , the red - to - blue crossing can occur approximately when the hot spot is moving perpendicular to the observer s line of sight .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that for cataclysmic variables with a strong optical emitting hot spot , a phase offset exists between spectroscopic and photometric phase zero ; a stellar eclipse of the hot spot would occur prior to the hot spot being perpendicular to our line of sight .",
    "the measured radial velocity curves of the h@xmath77 and h@xmath78 optical emission lines of ex hya exhibit a red - to - blue crossing which lags photometric binary phase zero by approximately @xmath79 in phase @xcite .",
    "the optical emission lines are likely to be biased by the motion of the hot spot @xcite so that the red - to - blue crossing may be interpreted as occurring when the hot spot is traveling approximately perpendicular to the observer s line of sight .",
    "thus , traveling along the binary orbit , true binary phase zero would occur first , followed by photometric phase zero , and then spectroscopic phase zero , i.e. , an eclipse of the white dwarf by the secondary star ( if present ) would be seen before photometric phase zero",
    ".    applied to ex hya , this implies that an eclipse of the white dwarf by the secondary would be seen at a phase prior to photometric binary zero , such as @xmath59 .",
    "however , the minimum depth of a stellar eclipse is likely to remain constant and not be dependent upon the spin phase during which it is observed",
    ". we will show in the following section that a constant minimum is not the case for this `` eclipse '' .",
    "therefore , although the phasing of the dip at @xmath59 may be correct for a stellar `` eclipse '' , its classification as such is still questionable .",
    "the identification of the origin of the dips seen at @xmath59 and @xmath60 is facilitated by examining the binary phased light curve extracted at different spin phases ( figure [ wdcompare ] ) .",
    "an intriguing feature of the euv light curves is the relative intensity of the dips at phases @xmath59 and @xmath60 . table [ countrate ] provides the unscaled mid - dip count rates for both the @xmath59 and @xmath60 dips .",
    "the @xmath59 dip is shallowest during the spin maximum phase and not noticeably different from the other small dips appearing throughout these light curves .",
    "the count rate at dip minimum in the spin maximum light curve ranges from @xmath80 greater than the mid - dip count rate in the spin minimum light curve to @xmath81 greater than the mid - dip count rate in the spin decline light curve .",
    "the difference between mid - dip count rates for the @xmath60 dip is not as extreme , with the spin maximum mid - dip count rate being @xmath82 greater than the spin minimum mid - dip count rate , ranging to @xmath81 greater than the spin decline value .",
    "gaussians were fit to the @xmath59 and @xmath60 dips in the averaged and all four spin phased binary light curves .",
    "the results of the gaussian fits are given in table [ times ] .",
    "the errors on the measured midpoint values fall within the light curve resolution of @xmath83 .",
    "the midpoint of the @xmath59 dip appears to be consistent between the spin maximum and spin rise phases , at @xmath84 , and between the spin minimum and decline phases at @xmath85 , however , within the resolution of @xmath83 , these values are the same .",
    "the @xmath60 dip midpoint is also consistent in phase at @xmath86 .",
    "fwhm and fwzi values are a bit more scattered .",
    "the fwhm values for both dips are the same , within errors , between spin maximum and minimum .",
    "the spin rise and decline fwhm values are scattered and show no coherent pattern as are the fwzi values for each dip over all spin phases .",
    "the short duration of both dips implies that the region being eclipsed is most likely small in size and close to the white dwarf surface , i.e. the inner accretion curtain close to the accretion pole where the euv radiation is emitted .",
    "other asymmetries between the binary euv light curves of ex hya in figure [ wdcompare ] are seen within the broad dip extending from @xmath87 , which is attributed to photoelectric absorption of the accretion region by the bulge or hot spot @xcite .",
    "this broad dip feature has been seen in the light curves of previous euv and x - ray studies of ex hya @xcite .",
    "@xcite show a broad dip which extends for approximately @xmath88 in the @xmath89 kev band and has an asymmetric shape with a gradual decline and rapid rise while the eclipse seen in @xcite ( @xmath90 kev ) is a little wider in phase .",
    "the euv bulge dip as shown in @xcite and @xcite extends from @xmath91 and shows the same gradual decline and rapid rise as the binary light curve presented in this paper .    in a typical cataclysmic variable or intermediate polar system with an accretion disk , the hot spot , the region where the mass transfer stream impacts with the accretion disk , is centered around binary phase @xmath92 and does not extend `` backwards '' past the line of centers .",
    "two things make the bulge in ex hya atypical ; it physically extends over half of the outer edge of the accretion disk ( see also hellier et al . 2000 who present a @xmath75-band light curve of ex hya with an orbital hump extending from @xmath93 ) , and it extends past binary phase zero .",
    "however , we do note that some non - magnetic cataclysmic variables also exhibit an extended hot spot region ( e.g. , z cha , wood et al .",
    "1986 ) .",
    "the bulge dip appears slightly different when compared between each spin phase as shown in figure [ wdcompare ] .",
    "several differences between the bulge dips in the different light curves are immediately obvious : for example , during the maximum phase , the bulge dip is shallower and has a more gradual decline .",
    "however , the temporal extent of the bulge dip appears to be the same in all spin phases , with the exception of an extra shallow dip , preceding the bulge dip , from @xmath94 in the spin minimum light curve .",
    "one could argue that the reason for the more rapid decline in flux in the spin minimum light curve is simply due to the fact that there is already a higher optical depth along the line of sight ( the accretion curtain ) to the accretion pole during the minimum phase .",
    "however , this absorption effect would act to absorb the emission by the same amount throughout the entire binary orbit rather than causing extra absorption at a particular binary phase . in the early phases of the bulge dip ,",
    "@xmath95 , the spin maximum count rate is @xmath96 greater than the spin minimum count rate . comparing this value to the count rate difference in the averaged spin light curve ( @xmath49 , figure [ splc ] ) , it is obvious that there must be extra absorption in addition to the accretion curtains during the bulge dip phases .",
    "a change in bulge size is likely to manifest itself observationally in wavebands additional to the euv , and indeed , we do see a difference when comparing our optical data to the optical light curves from previous studies .",
    "for example , our @xmath75-band light curve compared with the @xmath75 light curve of @xcite shows a decreased eclipse depth and very prevalent optical sidebands ( see figure 7 of belle et al .",
    "2002b for a comparison of the light curves ) .",
    "speculating that these sidebands might be seen in the euv photometry of ex hya , we phased our euv photometric data on common optical orbital sidebands ( or beat frequencies ) usually seen in intermediate polars : @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the spin frequency and @xmath101 is the binary orbital frequency .",
    "coherent modulation , to some degree , was seen on all of these beat frequencies .    in order to investigate the modulations seen on the orbital sidebands and other periods",
    ", we searched our euv photometry for periods using the phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ) routine @xcite .",
    "pdm provides statistical testing for a given period via a two - sided f - test .",
    "figure [ power ] presents the results of this analysis , in the form of a thetagram , with the y - axis representing @xmath102 which expresses frequency significance , with lower values of @xmath102 indicating more statistically significant frequencies .",
    "the photometric data was searched for periodicity over time intervals of 10 min ( 144 cycles day@xmath40 ) to 20 days ( 0.05 cycles day@xmath40 ) , consistent with the available sampling window provided by our long data set and the nyquist sampling limit . for the data set shown in figure [ power ] , which contains 97,274 samples , a value of @xmath103 defines the 99% confidence level for period believability .",
    "the 95% confidence level is near @xmath104 .",
    "the occurrence of sampling aliases was lowered by increasing the bin size over which the data were searched , as recommended by @xcite .",
    "we see that in figure [ power ] essentially all the periods found are real , they are very well defined , and we have identified a few frequencies of interest on the figure , including that for the _ euve _ satellite orbital period ( @xmath105 min ) .",
    "there are approximately 50 frequencies with @xmath102 values above the 95% confidence level ( @xmath104 ) appearing in the thetagram .",
    "we have identified all of these frequencies as beats between the spin , orbit , and satellite frequencies , but have only labeled the more common beat frequencies on figure [ power ] , and frequencies that have been identified in previous photometry of ex hya .",
    "the @xmath106 day@xmath40 frequency is strong with @xmath107 and many of the frequencies appearing in the range @xmath108 day@xmath40 are satellite beat frequencies , but we have not labeled these frequencies in order to avoid confusion on the plot .",
    "the strongest beat frequencies are those between the satellite and orbit or spin frequency , rather than between the orbit and spin frequencies .",
    "we note that the orbital frequency , @xmath101 , is much stronger in the euv than in our optical and x - ray data ( @xmath101 and @xmath100 have roughly equal strengths in the euv , while @xmath100 is @xmath81 stronger than @xmath101 in the optical , and @xmath109 stronger in the x - ray ) , which is the cause of the numerous beat frequencies visible in the figure [ power ] .",
    "figure [ pdm ] is a time - sampled thetagram , where the gray scale indicates @xmath102 as in figure [ power ] .",
    "this plot was made by a modified version of the pdm code allowing for time - sampled thetagrams to be produced .",
    "here we used 5000 data points per segment , and then stepped through the entire data set by increments of 500 data points ( data point refers to a 10 sec bin and the sets of data points do not necessarily have equal time sampling ) .",
    "we thus produced the trailed thetagram seen in figure [ pdm ] , which covers the time period from 2000 may 5 to june 10 , the entire _ euve _ observation .",
    "along the y - axis , one time step refers to a bin of 5000 data points .",
    "the known periods and sidebands , including the satellite beat frequencies , are fairly constant and strong throughout the temporal sampling covered in the plot .",
    "however , there are some interesting frequencies around 25 day@xmath40 and 33 day@xmath40 which appear suddenly in the middle of the data set .",
    "these frequencies are likely to be beat frequencies , but their appearance during only part of the observation is intriguing and suggests that one or more of the beating frequencies is not constant throughout the data set , i.e. , the geometry and/or physical conditions of ex hya are evolving , to some extent . the frequencies appearing at @xmath110 day@xmath40 are associated with the frequencies @xmath111 and @xmath112 but it is interesting to note that what appears to be the @xmath111 frequency wanders back and forth throughout the entire data set .",
    "the appearance of the wandering and intermittent periods in our high energy data probably indicates that there are additional or changing sources of reprocessing of the euv radiation",
    ". these may always be present in the euv or may be manifestations of the variable nature of ex hya . a detailed study of the periodicities seen in our contemporaneous observations of ex hya in the x - ray , euv , uv , and optical will be presented in a future work .",
    "figure [ spec ] presents euv spectra extracted from the four white dwarf spin phases , as described in figure [ splc ] , and table [ t2 ] presents the stronger lines we have identified in each spectrum , along with their fluxes and @xmath113 .",
    "the emission lines seen in these spectra are from highly ionized neon and iron , with the coolest lines ( neon ) having @xmath114 k and the hottest lines ( iron ) having temperatures of @xmath115 k. only five lines appear ( above the @xmath64 error ) in each of the four spin phased spectra , four of which are blended : @xmath116 , @xmath117/ @xmath118 , and @xmath119/ @xmath120 .",
    "these lines have @xmath121 6.3 , 6.9 , 6.7 , 7.1 , and 6.9 k , respectively . using the flux ratios of these lines",
    ", we can further confine the temperature range of the emitting plasma . according to the optically thin plasma model of mewe , gronenschild , & van den oord ( 1985 ) , the flux ratios of the lines at @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124",
    "match those expected for a @xmath125 k plasma .",
    "the flux ratio determined temperature is in agreement with the @xmath66 values of the individual lines .",
    "however , if we consider the flux ratio of the two ne lines we have identified in the spin maximum and decline spectra , / @xmath126  to @xmath127 , the plasma temperature determination is significantly lower , near @xmath128 k , for both spin phases .",
    "line ratios may also be used to determine plasma densities according to @xcite , table iva , using lines that have @xmath129 k. only two of the four spectra have emission lines near this temperature which are unblended : spin maximum and spin decline .",
    "the _ spin maximum _ line ratio , @xmath130/ @xmath131@xmath132 , gives a density of @xmath133 ( note that @xmath130  actually has @xmath134 ) .",
    "the line ratio of @xmath135/ @xmath136@xmath137 in the _ spin decline _ spectrum gives a lower density , @xmath138 ( @xmath139 when considering the lower limit determined from the uncertainty ) .",
    "these values may indicate an observed density range , although poorly constrained .",
    "we would like to note that the density determined from the @xmath140 line ratio does have a problem , as the ratio uses lines from two different charge states and depends strongly on the plasma temperature .",
    "for example , if we were to initially assume a low density plasma , table iv of @xcite shows that the value of the @xmath140 ratio measured here matches well with a @xmath141 k. considering that our spin decline line ratio finds a low density , it is likely that assuming a constant temperature of @xmath142 k for the @xmath140 ratio does not adequately take into account the strong dependence on temperature of the different charge states , and that the lines are likely to be formed in a lower density plasma .    using only the reliably determined density above ( @xmath1 ) , our value does not agree with the electron densities which have been previously determined for ex hya .",

    "@xcite found a value of @xmath144 from our _ chandra _ spectrum using the @xmath145  line ratio .",

    "2002b ) suggests that a high temperature plasma ( @xmath19 k ) is constantly in view during the times in which we see other euv emitting regions of lower temperature and lower density .",
    "the absence of the @xmath146  line , and also the @xmath147line , during the mid - bulge dip phase suggests that these lines are formed interior to the bulge and that their emitting region is roughly confined to the orbital plane .",
    "the emission line centers appear to shift over the four spin phases .",
    "each spin phase is comprised of many orbital phases , so radial velocities of these lines will be a complex sum of both motions . also , a radial velocity curve over spin phase will not have much meaning when only containing four points .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that the / blend at @xmath146has a fairly constant negative velocity at all spin phases with an average value of @xmath148 .",
    "the other two strong lines which appear in each of the four spectra also have negative velocities over all four spin phases .",
    "the @xmath116  emission line has its most blue - shifted velocity of @xmath149 during spin maximum and its lowest blue - shifted velocity of @xmath150 during spin decline .",
    "the / blend at @xmath147  is not blue - shifted to the same extent and has its greatest blue - shift of @xmath151 during spin minimum .",
    "the sw spectrometer rms error of @xmath69  @xcite , which has not been added to the @xmath68 errors given for the line velocities above , translates to a velocity error of @xmath152 at @xmath153 , @xmath154 at @xmath155 , and @xmath156 at @xmath157 ; even assigning a systematic maximum uncertainty to the line velocities , we note that the emission lines are generally still blue - shifted .",
    "( the @xmath158velocity of ex hya has not been subtracted from these values due to the fact that it is not well constrained . )    taken at face value , the phase - independent blue - shifts of the emission lines in the _ euve _ spectra tell us that the lines may be associated with some outflowing material . however , we note that @xcite reported that the @xmath159emission lines had a wavelength offset consistent with zero ( though the error from the wavelength accuracy they quote does allow these lines to be blue - shifted . ) the accretion pole regions would be a likely site for outflowing material in the form of a wind or jet .",
    "the disappearance of the @xmath146  line during the bulge dip would mean that the poles must be highly inclined with respect to the spin axis if the cause of its blue - shift is due to jets .",
    "we believe instead that this outflow may originate as a wind from the inner edge of the accretion disk , a feature common in high mass transfer binaries , possibly associated with shocks in the accretion disk ( see below )",
    ". such an emission site would constantly provide outflowing material directed at the observer , while also being absorbed during the bulge dip phases . in an upcoming paper discussing our _ hst _ data @xcite , we show that blue - shifted absorption components ( p cygni profiles ) , features which are indicative of outflowing material , are seen in several of the uv emission lines .",
    "the current intermediate polar model has the white dwarf evenly accreting matter from an annular accretion disk via accretion curtains onto both magnetic poles ( e.g. , patterson 1994 ) .",
    "however , @xcite have recently shown that ex hya exists in a spin equilibrium state such that this model may not hold true .",
    "they first note that although a disk may form in any intermediate polar , it is generally far from keplerian due to the influence of the magnetic field on the accretion flow in the disk . for ex hya , where the spin period is close to the binary orbital period ( @xmath160 for ex hya compared with @xmath161 for other ips ) , the equilibrium condition is such that the corotation and the circularization radii are roughly equal to the distance to the inner lagrange point @xmath162 .",
    "this condition is true for a special class of intermediate polars which possess a white dwarf with a magnetic moment of @xmath163 ( and @xmath164 hr ) , corresponding to a magnetic field strength of @xmath165 mg for the white dwarf in ex hya .",
    "the euv data presented in this paper support the model alluded to by the @xcite study in which non - uniform accretion from the disk onto the white dwarf magnetic poles occurs .",
    "the extended bulge dip seen in the binary light curve ( figure [ bplc ] ) , the absorption dips seen throughout the binary light curves of figure [ wdcompare ] , along with the differing absorption amounts seen between these same light curves are all evidence of non - uniform accretion .",
    "we propose that the magnetic field in ex hya is strong enough to begin pulling some material vertically from the outer edge of the disk , thereby forming a large accretion curtain which would produce the very broad and extended bulge .",
    "material after binary phase 0 would accumulate as it encounters the bulge in the accretion disk .",
    "this concept is depicted in figure [ curtain ] ( although we have drawn accretion curtains which extend only from the inner or outer disk , it is more likely that there would be a continuous curtain extending between the two disk edges . ) matter attaching to the magnetic field lines at the outer edge of the disk would form accretion streams which would act to absorb radiation emitted from the accretion poles and would produce dips within the binary light curves , such as those seen at @xmath59 and @xmath60 . these dips are reminiscent of dips seen in polar light curves ( e.g. , belle , howell , & mills 2000 ) . inspection of figure [ wdcompare ] shows that the dips at @xmath59 and @xmath60 have varying depths ( values are given in table [ countrate ] ) , with the dips during spin minimum having the greatest amount of absorption . at spin and binary phases such that spin minimum and the bulge eclipse are coincident ( @xmath166 and @xmath167 ) , material in the bulge , already extending above the plane of the disk , may be controlled by the magnetic field and produce denser streams .",
    "if the dips seen in the binary phased light curve are caused by material attached to the field lines , why are the dips seen along the binary phase rather than the spin phase ?",
    "the reality of the magnetic field attachment to the outer edge of the disk is that the field lines will be affected by magnetic torque such that the lines will become twisted . while the white dwarf magnetic pole has already started to rotate away from the bulge",
    ", the distortion of the magnetic field caused by the torque will allow the field lines to remain attached at the bulge . as long as the field lines remain attached",
    ", matter will be kept from falling back down to the accretion disk . in this way",
    ", the dips would be seen along the binary phase rather than the spin phase .",
    "if the scenario just described is true for ex hya , the strength of the magnetic field needed to pull material from the outer edge of the disk can be estimated . using the equation , @xmath168 to calculate the radius of the magnetosphere @xcite and setting @xmath169 equal to the outer accretion disk radius",
    ", we can solve for @xmath170 .",
    "we use white dwarf masses of @xmath171 @xcite and @xmath172 @xcite to represent the range of primary masses which have been determined for ex hya .",
    "optical spectroscopic emission line velocities ( our optical data will appear in a future paper ) , and the white dwarf mass range , give the outer disk radius as @xmath173 or @xmath174 . with an accretion rate of @xmath175 @xcite , we find a magnetic field strength of @xmath176 mg .",
    "we would like to note that using the optical emission line velocities to determine the disk radius assumes that some of the disk is in keplerian motion .",
    "the far - reaching magnetic field has implications other than producing an extended bulge .",
    "as stated previously , the circularization radius is roughly equal to the corotation radius @xcite .",
    "this intimates that part or possibly all of the accretion disk is rotating with the white dwarf .",
    "although we do not know the latitude of the magnetic poles on the white dwarf surface , the modulation seen on the spin period suggests that the poles are moderately inclined ( @xmath177 , kim & beuermann 1995 , 1996 ) with respect to the rotation axis of the white dwarf .",
    "the accretion disk , then , would not feel a constant magnetic force , but rather would feel the highest field strength at the regions of the disk closest to the poles .",
    "at these locations along the disk , the disk material would be more affected by the magnetic field strength and hence would become controlled by the magnetic field .",
    "thus , we have a situation in which some amount of material in two chunks , or pie slices ( one facing each pole ) , along the accretion disk are rotating with the white dwarf , while the rest of the accretion disk may ( or may not ) be rotating with the white dwarf .",
    "the outer disk velocities measured from the optical spectra are around @xmath178 , while the velocity of the magnetic field sweeping through the disk is calculated at the corotation radius ( @xmath179 cm ) to be @xmath180 , again enforcing the statement that the outer disk is corotating with the white dwarf magnetic field .",
    "an issue pertaining to the corotating pie slices in the accretion disk is the presence of shocks which may form as matter of different velocities interacts in the accretion disk .",
    "modeling shocks is beyond the scope of this paper , however , we argue that the similar velocities of the white dwarf and accretion disk ( as discussed previously ) would produce very low energy shocks .",
    "high energy emission lines are already seen in the spectra and because the bulge dip eclipses all euv emission ( i.e. , we can not distinguish between the white dwarf or accretion disk being eclipsed ) , it is not possible to discern if these lines originate in a shock from the accretion disk , or from the shocks and high energy plasmas associated with regions near the magnetic accretion poles .",
    "however , if the shocks produce winds , they may be responsible for the highly blue - shifted lines seen in the euv spectra .",
    "another question to answer is why strong power is not seen at the @xmath181 frequency if the magnetic field is coupled to the accretion disk ( though we note that while this frequency is not strong , it is above the 95% confidence level . )",
    "this might be expected if there was a bright euv point source situated on the edge of the disk , however , the outer edge of the disk is vertically extended and cool and will emit most strongly at lower energies , such as optical wavelengths .",
    "we will show in a future paper describing our optical data that strong power _ is seen _ on the @xmath181 frequency .",
    "we should also consider the possibility that an overflow accretion stream may be responsible for the small dips seen at @xmath59 and @xmath60 , instead of magnetically controlled streams causing these dips .",
    "we argue that this is not likely for several reasons .",
    "first , there are many dips seen throughout the bulge dip , starting at @xmath182 and continuing through to @xmath183 , which makes it likely that these dips are caused by material associated with the bulge .",
    "second , the overflow stream is unlikely to extend far enough above the orbital plane in order to be along the line of sight to the accretion poles .",
    "third , this overflow stream would follow along its ballistic trajectory and would not be in a position to cause a dip occurring after binary phase 0 .",
    "the photometric and spectroscopic data presented here have provided us with some intriguing results for ex hya .",
    "this system clearly does not conform to the traditional intermediate polar model . a broad bulge dip ,",
    "numerous smaller dips throughout the binary light curve , and the inconsistencies between binary light curves extracted at different spin phases all indicate that ex hya may be accreting material from the outer edge of the accretion disk thereby producing an extended bulge and large accretion curtain . for material at the outer edge of the disk to become magnetically controlled",
    ", the magnetic field of the white dwarf must be on the order of @xmath184 mg .",
    "these extended regions may also be reprocessing sites of euv radiation , as can be seen from the many strong beat frequencies appearing in the single thetagram ( figure [ power ] ) and time - series thetagram ( figure [ pdm ] ) .",
    "iron spectral line ratios give a temperature of @xmath185 k for the emitting plasma but provide only a poorly constrained density of @xmath138 .",
    "it is likely that regions of varying temperature and density are viewed simultaneously throughout the spin orbit .",
    "future papers will investigate the physical meaning of the strong frequencies in greater detail , along with relating the euv data to our other wavelength observations .",
    "we would like to thank c. mauche for his contributions and comments on this work and the anonymous referee for very valuable comments .",
