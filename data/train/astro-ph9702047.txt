    "clusters of galaxies ( cgs ) are luminous x - ray sources ( sarazin 1988 ) . x - rays are thought to be emitted through thermal bremsstrahlung from very hot , optically thin plasma gas in intergalactic space , which is called intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "recent x - ray and optical observations have revealed dynamical aspects of cgs ( fabricant , kent & kurtz 1989 ; kneib et al .",
    "time evolution of the cluster x - ray luminosity function has been confirmed ; each cg became brighter and the number density of cgs with a fixed x - ray luminosity increased through mergers towards zero redshift ( edge et al .",
    "1990 ; gioia et al.1990 ; henry et al .",
    "1992 ; bower et al . 1993",
    "; castander et al .",
    "1994 ) . to understand the physical structure of cgs , therefore , it is essential to consider non - equilibrium processes involved with the dynamical evolution of cgs .",
    "recent extensive x - ray observations have established that the temperature profiles of icm are nearly flat in many clusters ( fabian 1994 ; ohashi et al 1996 ) .",
    "although there is no widely accepted explanation for this , it is , at least , reasonable to expect that shock heating through gravitational collapse plays an important role .",
    "it then follows that the isothermality of gas may reflect the shape and time evolution of the gravitational potential well .",
    "what then governs the total dynamics of cgs ? it is galaxies and dark matter ( dm ) , both of which can be regarded as a collisionless self - gravitating many - body system .",
    "dynamics of icm , collisional fluid on a cg scale , simply follows the dynamical evolution of the gravitational potential exerted mainly by dm and galaxies .",
    "thus , the thermal history of icm is rather sensitive to the physical processes involving violent time variation of gravitational potential field ( such as formation , merger , etc ) , violent relaxation ( lynden - bell 1967 ) is thought to play a crucial role there , although its physical significance is still poorly understood ( funato , makino & ebisuzaki 1992a , b ; takizawa & inagaki 1996 ) .",
    "cgs were believed to be formed from overdense perturbations in the universe .",
    "they grew through gravitational instability and collapsed at @xmath6 .",
    "cgs have been growing by accreting ambient matter , which is still an ongoing process at the present .",
    "gunn & gott ( 1972 ) quantitatively discussed the growth of a spherical symmetric perturbation consisting of only collisionless particle in an expanding universe .",
    "bertschinger ( 1985 ) found the self - similar solution describing evolution of spherical density fluctuation consisting of dm and gas in the einstein - de sitter universe ( where the cosmological density parameter is @xmath7 and the cosmological constant is @xmath8 ) .",
    "there have been plenty of numerical studies performed so far regarding the formation and evolution of cgs by using n - body and hydrodynamic codes .",
    "perrenod ( 1978 ) was the first to calculate the evolution of a spherical symmetric cluster with standard mesh hydrodynamic code .",
    "three - dimensional calculations have been carried out recently , which mostly use smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) codes ( evrard 1990 ; thomas & couchman 1992 ; bryan et al .",
    "1994 ; metzler & evrard 1994 ; navarro , frenk & white 1995 , hereafter nfw ) .",
    "according to evrard ( 1990 ) , a shock front moved outward when gas around the cluster accreted onto the cluster center and a relatively flat temperature profile was realized within the shock front .",
    "this result was significant in the sense that the above expectation was confirmed qualitatively .",
    "however , quantitative estimation may be problematic because of limited spatial resolutions and poor reliability of sph code in calculations of shocks .",
    "it might be kept in mind that sph codes are easy to work with and could give reasonable accuracy , however , they are not better for problems with discontinuities ( such as strong shock and contact discontinuity ) than mesh codes ( monaghan 1992 ) . on a larger scale , numerical simulations of cosmological structure formation by using n - body and hydrodynamic mesh code",
    "have been carried out mainly to investigate the statistical properties of cgs ( cen & ostriker 1994 ; kang et al .",
    "1994 ; anninos & norman 1996 ) .    in this paper , we focus on the dynamical aspects of icm , such as time - dependent properties of shock waves and the effects of shock heating on the evolution of cgs . for this purpose ,",
    "we perform numerical simulations of spherical cgs with n - body ( shell model ) + mesh code ( tvd ) .",
    "note that the tvd code is one of the most useful tools to deal with spatial discontinuities .",
    "since we assume spherical symmetry , the problem can be reduced to one - dimensional .",
    "better spatial resolutions can be achieved , therefore . using these codes",
    ", we calculate dynamical evolutions of a density perturbation of @xmath0 consisting of dm and gas and collapsing at @xmath6 in universe with @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate how different cosmological models affect evolution of cgs .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ simulations ]",
    "we describe our numerical methods and the adopted initial conditions . in section [ results ]",
    "we present our results , discussing physical processes underlying the structural evolution of calculated cgs . in section [ summary ]",
    "we summarize our results and discuss their implications .",
    "in the present study we regard cg consisting of two components : collisionless particles corresponding to galaxies and dm , and gas corresponding to icm . when calculating gravity both components are considered , although the former component dominates over the latter .",
    "we also assume spherical symmetry in all the calculations .      for calculations of collisionless particles",
    "we adopt a shell model ( hnon 1964 ) .",
    "the distribution function of spherical symmetric stellar systems can be expressed as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is radial distance , @xmath11 is radial velocity , @xmath12 is tangential velocity , and @xmath13 is time , respectively .",
    "so the state of the system is represented by @xmath14 points in the @xmath15 space ( with @xmath14 being the number of shells ) and a trajectory of the @xmath16-th point at @xmath17 is calculated according to the equations of motion ; @xmath18 for @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the gravitational constant , @xmath21 (= constant in time ) is angular momentum of the @xmath16-th shell , and @xmath22 is total mass ( also including mass of gas ) interior to @xmath23 , respectively . since it is convenient to carry out numerical calculations using comoving coordinates for our purpose , we transform @xmath17 to @xmath24 as follows ; @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the dimensionless scale factor of the universe and @xmath27 represents the derivative of @xmath26 with respect to time .",
    "equations ( [ eq : drdt ] ) and ( [ eq : dudt ] ) are then transformed into @xmath28 respectively , by using equations ( [ eq : rvsr ] ) and ( [ eq : uvsu ] ) . equations ( [ eq : drdt ] ) and ( [ eq : dudt ] ) are integrated by using leap - frog method .",
    "as to the inner boundary condition we set a reflecting wall at @xmath29 and impose that when a shell reaches the wall , @xmath30 , that shell is elastically reflected . only shells with rather small angular momentum is influenced by the wall .      for gas components basic equations in the comoving frame",
    "are as follows , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is gas density , @xmath33 is radial velocity of gas , @xmath34 is gas pressure , and @xmath35 is the adiabatic exponent , respectively .",
    "the total energy of gas per unit mass , @xmath36 , and the enthalpy per unit mass , @xmath37 , are given by @xmath38 respectively , and @xmath39 is defined by @xmath40 where , @xmath41 is the total mass ( including gas and collisionless particles ) inside @xmath42 .",
    "we neglect viscosity and angular momentum of gas .",
    "we also assume that gas is ideal gas with @xmath43 .",
    "a second order up - wind tvd code ( minmod limiter ) is used for our simulations ( hirsch 1990 ) .",
    "number of mesh point is 500 and one mesh spacing corresponds to @xmath44 mpc with @xmath45 being a redshift [ @xmath46 .",
    "we set boundary condition as follows .",
    "the inner edge is assumed to be a perfectly reflecting point ; @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 is gas density , gas pressure and radial velocity of gas at the @xmath16-th mesh point , and the first mesh point corresponds to the inner boundary .",
    "the @xmath51-th and @xmath52-st points are necessary for calculations ( to derive spatial derivatives of physical quantities ) .",
    "the outer edge is assumed to be a perfectly transmitting surface ; @xmath53 where @xmath54 is any physical quantity of gas at the @xmath16-th mesh point and the @xmath55-th corresponds to the outer boundary .",
    "again , the @xmath56-th and @xmath57-th points are necessary for calculation purpose .      in this paper ,",
    "calculations are carried out from @xmath58 to the present time ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "we adopt cosmological models with no cosmological constant , @xmath60 . when @xmath1 , therefore , we find @xmath61 while when @xmath62 we have @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the hubble constant and is set to be @xmath65 ( km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ) in transformations of length and time .",
    "we make initial density profiles in the same manner as peebles ( 1982 ) .",
    "at first we prepare @xmath14 concentric shells with uniform density being equal to the mean density of the universe at @xmath58 .",
    "then a density fluctuation is introduced by perturbing the radius and velocity of each shell as @xmath66 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the unperturbed coordinate and @xmath68 represents the perturbation as a function of @xmath10 ( specified below ) .",

    "the functional form of the perturbation is assumed as @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are , respectively , the initial size of the fluctuation on the comoving scale and the parameter for displacement ( see nakamura 1996 ) .",
    "we take @xmath75 mpc ) for model a ( with @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 mpc ) for model b ( with @xmath78 ) , respectively . in both models",
    "the fluctuation contains a mass of about @xmath0 and correspond to typical density peaks with @xmath79 in the cdm power spectrum with @xmath80 . here",
    ", @xmath81 is the rms density fluctuations on a cluster scale and @xmath82 is the rms of mass fluctuation on scale 8 mpc ; @xmath80 was obtained from the observation of nearby galaxy distribution ( see suto 1993 ) .",
    "the profile of the initial density perturbation and the ratio of @xmath83 are illustrated in figure [ indmden ] for model a ( by the solid line ) and b ( by the dotted line ) , respectively .",
    "here , @xmath84 is the mass fluctuation averaged over a scale @xmath10 , whereas @xmath85 is the rms of mass fluctuation averaged over a scale @xmath10 obtained from cdm power spectrum with @xmath80 .",
    "the initial conditions of gas are set as follows . at first density of gas",
    "was everywhere set to be 1/10 of the mean density of the universe at @xmath86 and temperature of gas ( @xmath87 ) was everywhere taken to be @xmath88 k except in model lt , where we assumed @xmath89k initially",
    ". then adiabatic fluctuation ( cf . eq .",
    "16 and 17 ) was imposed so that gas density became always 1/10 of that of dm .",
    "note that gas temperature distribution becomes nonuniform , accordingly .",
    "we calculated 3 models in total .",
    "model parameters are listed in table [ parameters ] .",
    "at first we overview the evolution of model a cluster .",
    "the evolution of density and radial velocity profiles of dm are displayed in figure [ dms8o1.0ex ] .",
    "the different types of lines correspond to different redshifts ( and different times ) : @xmath90 ( @xmath91 gyr ) by the long dash line ; @xmath92 ( @xmath93 gyr ) by the short dash line ; @xmath94 ( @xmath95 gyr ) by the dotted line ; and @xmath96 ( @xmath97 gyr ) by the solid line , respectively .    density profile basically obeys a power law , @xmath98 , and evolves in a self - similar fashion after @xmath99 .",
    "the evolutions in the radial distributions of radial velocity , density , temperature , pressure , and entropy ( each of the gas component ) are summarized in figure [ gascla1 ] .",
    "the different types of lines correspond to same redshifts as in figure [ dms8o1.0ex ] .",
    "there are fundamental features commonly seen in the course of evolution of all the models , which can be summarized as follows .    1 .   before the initiation of dm collapse ( at @xmath100 ; @xmath101 gyr ) gas continues to expand , following the cosmological expansion .",
    "when dm begins to collapse , a shock wave emerges in the central part and moves outwards , accreting ambient gas towards the center .",
    "2 .   the shock front separates the inner hot region from the outer cool region . in the inner region , gas is almost in hydrostatic equilibrium , although bulk velocity of radial infall@xmath3 km s@xmath4 still remains .",
    "the temperature profile is relatively flat and gas is hot enough to emit x - ray . in the outer region , in contrast , gas falls almost freely and is too cool to emit x - ray .",
    "density profile of gas evolves self - similarly as @xmath102 inside the shock front except near the center , where density profile is rather flat . even after the passage of the shock , density , temperature , and , therefore , pressure ,",
    "gradually increase with time .",
    "this indicates that the inner region is not perfectly in hydrostatic equilibrium ( will be discussed in  3.3 ) .",
    "4 .   entropy profile shows an overall increase outwards , suggesting larger entropy production taking place as the shock moves outward .",
    "there are wavy features seen , especially , in the distributions of temperature and entropy .",
    "these seem to be related to sound wave propagation ( will be discussed in  3.4 ) .",
    "let us next examine each item in more details and discuss similarities and differences between different models .",
    "density profiles of dm at @xmath96 can well be fitted with the @xmath103-model ; @xmath104^{-3 \\beta_{\\rm dm } /2}.",

    "we fit the results of simulations inside @xmath107 , the radius where the mean interior density is @xmath108 times of critical density at @xmath96 .",
    "the results of the fitting are summarized in table [ dmden ] .",
    "note that these results may depend on initial density profile .    in the same way density profiles of gas at @xmath96 inside the shock fronts can be fitted with the @xmath103-model , @xmath109^{-3 \\beta_{\\rm gas } /2 } ,                                                                  \\label{eq : beta2 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are fitting parameters .",
    "the results are listed in table [ gasden ] . in all models",
    "we find @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "we also depict nondimensional density profiles at @xmath96 in figure [ ndden ] for model a ( by the solid line ) and model b ( by the dotted line ) , respectively , where density is scaled with @xmath114 , critical density of the universe at @xmath96 , and radius is scaled with @xmath107 .",
    "nondimensional dm density profiles look similar among two models , whereas gas component expands slightly in model b , compared with that in model a.    let us finally compare our results with the previous results ( nfw ) .",
    "as for the density profiles of the clusters in einstein - de sitter universe ( models a and lt ) , the core radii are smaller than those of nfw ( who obtained @xmath115 ) , while @xmath106 and @xmath111 are similar . on the other hand , central dm density , @xmath116 , is similar to that of nfw , whereas central gas density , @xmath117 , of model a is lower than that of nfw ( our model lt is consistent with their model ; @xmath118 ) .",
    "this can be explained in terms of different initial gas temperatures ( see section [ ditg ] ) .",
    "temperature and entropy profiles are shown in figure [ ent ] in the upper and lower panels , respectively .",
    "the different types of lines correspond to different models : model a by the solid line ; model b by the dotted line ; and model lt by the short dash line , respectively .",
    "there are common characters as follows .",
    "temperatures gradually fall outwards until the shock front .",
    "there are small temperature fluctuations seen .",
    "if we evaluate the propagation speed of fluctuation pattern , it is @xmath119 , of the order of the sound velocity inside the shock .",
    "in addition , entropy pattern does not change much during the course of wave propagation , indicating that structural variation is adiabatic .",
    "we may thus conclude that the temperature fluctuation arises due to sound wave propagation .",
    "inside the shock fronts temperature is nearly virial , high enough to emit x - ray .",
    "entropy monotonically rises from the center to the shock front .",
    "that is , near the center gas is heated up mainly through adiabatic compression , thus possessing relatively lower entropy .",
    "gas in the outer region , on the other hand , will eventually be heated through shocks , which effectively transform kinetic energy of accreting gas into thermal energy at their surface .",
    "this explains relatively large entropy just inside the shock .",
    "note that regions with entropy decreasing outward are convectively unstable .",
    "convective motions , if occur , will smear out such a feature .    to understand why temperature , density and entropy steadily increase with time even after the passage of the shock front and how sound waves arise and propagate outward , we check the balance between pressure gradient and gravity in the inner parts . figure [ tsuriai ] shows the ratio of the absolute value of pressure gradient force , @xmath120 , and gravitational force inside the shock surface , @xmath121 , from @xmath122 gyr to @xmath123 gyr . if the system is perfectly in hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath124 should be unity .",
    "this figure shows a clear tendency that gravitational force overcomes pressure gradient force inside the shock front , thus inducing radial gas inflow from outside . therefore , gas is adiabatically compressed by the infalling material from outside .",
    "importantly , the ratio changes with time . since dm density profile hardly changes with time near the core , so does the gravity force ; the ratio changes are purely due to time and spatial variations in pressure profiles .",
    "when ambient gas suddenly falls towards the center , pressure at the core abruptly increases .",
    "this gives rise to an outwardly propagating sound wave , since the central point is a reflecting boundary due to spherial symmetry ( cf .",
    "figure [ wave ] shows radial velocity profiles of gas inside the shock from @xmath122 gyr to @xmath123 gyr .",
    "we confirm that radial infall systematically remains even after the passage of shock .",
    "in addition we confirm fluctuation pattern propagating outwards with a speed roughly equal to the sound velocity .    in our simulations",
    "thermal conduction is neglected .",
    "it is possible , however , that thermal conduction , if efficient , will erase temperature fluctuations on a small scale .",
    "it is thus worthwhile evaluating conduction timescale in the simulated clusters .",
    "conduction time scale is generally expressed as ( cf .",
    "sarazin 1988 ) @xmath125 where @xmath126 is electron number density , @xmath127 is scale length of temperature gradient , @xmath128 is the boltzmann constant , and thermal conductivity for hydrogen plasma is ( spitzer 1962 ) @xmath129 where @xmath130 , coulomb logarithm , is @xmath131 .",
    "\\label{eq : coulomb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from equations ( [ eq : tcond ] ) and ( [ eq : kappa ] ) , we derive @xmath132    for model a , for example , we find @xmath133 at @xmath134 mpc ( where @xmath135 , @xmath136 k , and @xmath137 mpc ) and @xmath138 at @xmath139 ( where @xmath140 , @xmath141 k , and @xmath137 mpc ) . at both radii",
    ", hence , conduction seems to be efficient .",
    "the same is true for model b. however , we should note that the usage of the classical conductivity ( spitzer 1962 ) is in question for cgs .",
    "in fact , we can not explain the existence of cooling flows as long as we employ the classical one ( binney & cowie 1981 ) .",
    "instead , it is suggested that tangled magnetic field ( rosner & tucker 1989 ) or plasma instabilities ( pistinner & shaviv 1996 ) are likely to suppress heat conduction significantly in cgs .",
    "temperature fluctuations can then survive .      as we have seen in figure [ wave ]",
    ", sound wave propagates outward , modulating temperature profile .",
    "this also affects shock front propagation , since sound velocity inside the shock is three times greater than the front velocity in strong shock limits .",
    "we illustrate in figure [ shock ] the radius of a shock surface ( @xmath142 ) as a function of the look - back time , time measured from the present time ; i.e. , @xmath143 corresponds to the present time ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "the different types of lines correspond to same models as in figure [ ent ] .",
    "shock surface moves with nearly a constant velocity ( @xmath144 km s@xmath4 ) .",
    "the radius of shock surface at @xmath96 , @xmath145 , and mean propagation velocity , @xmath146 , are listed in table [ shockpara ] . again",
    ", there are wavy features seen in this figure .    to understand the physics causing modulating features , we plot time variation of shock strength and shock radius ( @xmath147 ) for model a in figure [ shockamp ] . to evaluate shock strength we use @xmath148 with @xmath149 and @xmath150 being radial gas velocities inside and outside the shock surface , respectively , in the upper panel , and @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the pre - shock gas temperature in the unit of @xmath153 and @xmath154 with @xmath155 and @xmath156 being specific entropies inside and outside the shock surface , respectively , in the lower panel .",
    "since this quantity is proportional to heat produced through shock heating , it is a good representation of the shock strength .",
    "both panels show time modulation in shock strengths .",
    "this in turn creates spatial modulation in entropy profile , since shock radius moves outward with time ; namely , at the radius over which the shock passed with its maximum ( minimum ) strength in time , radial entropy profile exhibits a rapid ( or slow ) rise outward .",
    "the time modulation in shock strengths is likely to be caused by shock radius oscillation , and this oscillation is , as we discussed above , caused by the sound wave propagation .",
    "note that while the wavy pattern in temperature profile at a fixed radius varies with time because of sound wave propagation , that in entropy profile does not , since entropy profile is unaffected by sound waves .",
    "time evolutions of x - ray luminosity , @xmath157 , and the normalized luminosity , @xmath158 , are plotted for each model in figure [ tl ] ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . when calculating luminosity , we assume thermal bremsstrahlung of optically thin plasma ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) , @xmath159 where @xmath160 is gas temperature , @xmath55 is number density , @xmath161 is a frequency average of velocity - averaged gaunt factor . in this paper",
    "we set @xmath162 .",
    "emission from cool gas with temperature @xmath163 k was neglected because we are interested in time variation of x - ray luminosity .",
    "figure [ tlz ] plot evolution of @xmath164 and @xmath165 against @xmath45 instead of time .    in all models",
    "the luminosity rapidly rises just before the appearance of a shock wave , and then rises gradually afterwards .",
    "this behavior is due to the two distinct phases of evolution of gas .",
    "the first phase ( before the emergence of shock wave ) : : :    through accretion of ambient gas towards the center gas in the central    region is compressed adiabatically so that temperature and density    there rapidly rise until temperature reaches about virial temperature .",
    "the rapid increase in @xmath164 is thus due to a rapid rise in    temperature of the central region .",
    "the second phase ( after the appearance of shock wave ) : : :    as the shock wave propagates outwards , high temperature region    expands , thus increasing @xmath164 . at the same time",
    ", gas inside    the shock wave continues to be compressed adiabatically , thereby its    emissivity being increased gradually .",
    "luminosity thus increases faster    than @xmath166 ^ 3 \\propto t^{2.5}$ ] .      in this subsection",
    "we compare the results of model a ( @xmath167 ) and model b ( @xmath78 ) to discuss the @xmath168 dependence of the cluster evolution under the condition that the perturbation amplitudes at @xmath86 and total masses contained in the perturbations are similar .    from table",
    "[ dmden ] , we see that central dm density , @xmath116,is proportional to @xmath168 .",
    "the dm distribution is less concentrated in model b than in model a , because the ambient gas density is lower in a lower density universe so that a larger volume is needed to contain the same amount of mass ( @xmath169 ) initially .",
    "the absolute values of dm density are thus different among these models , but the shape of the dm density profiles are similar .",
    "this explains why nondimensional dm density profiles look similar among both models ( figure [ ndden]a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "central density of gas , @xmath170 , depends also on its initial entropy and is , hence , not strictly proportional to @xmath168 ( see table [ gasden ] ) .",
    "this is responsible for the differences in nondimensional gas density profiles among two models ( figure [ ndden]b ) .    in both models",
    "x - ray luminosity rises , however , the increase in @xmath171 is slower in model b than in model a. this tendency is more clearly seen when @xmath171 is plotted against times , rather than against redshifts ( see fig .",
    "[ tl]b , [ tlz]b ) . in the latter figure",
    ", the difference can be recognized at @xmath172 , but not at @xmath173 .",
    "this is because smaller amount of dm and gas surrounding a central condensation in a lower @xmath168 universe .",
    "we calculated a model with lower initial temperature ( lt ) to see how initial temperature affects the later evolution . the temperature and entropy profiles at @xmath96 of models",
    "a and lt are depicted in figure [ ent ] .",
    "there is no significant difference among these models , especially in the structure inside the shock front .",
    "the thermal property of gas outside the shock front has little influence on the thermal property of gas inside because of enormous entropy production at the shock surface .    on the other hand ,",
    "the central densities are different among these models ( figure [ denlt ] ) . according to @xmath170 estimated from the fitting data of table [ gasden ] and figure [ denlt ] ,",
    "central density of model lt is about three times greater than that of model a. in the density profiles at @xmath174 mpc , however , any difference can hardly be seen .    in the central region , gas is adiabatically compressed until the temperature reaches about the virial temperature .",
    "so lower initial gas temperature results in higher gas density , if the virial temperatures are the same in both models",
    ". however , the difference in central gas densities can not be perfectly explained by this picture .",
    "if there is no entropy production ( i.e. , gas is perfectly adiabatically compressed ) , central density of model lt should be about thirty times greater than that of model a. this means , shock heating took away the information about the initial gas temperature also in the central region .    because of higher central gas density model lt cluster is more luminous in x - ray than model a cluster ( figure [ tl]a , [ tlz]b ) .",
    "substantial difference , however , can not be seen in evolutionary behavior of x - ray luminosity of both model .",
    "( figure [ tl]b , [ tlz]b ) .",
    "we carry out the numerical simulations of spherical clusters of galaxies with shell model for dm and second order up - wind tvd scheme for icm to examine structural evolution of icm .",
    "shock front moves outwards as gas accretes towards cluster center , yielding a relatively flat temperature profile inside the shock front . density and pressure profiles evolves in a self - similar fashion .",
    "x - ray luminosity increases with time in two steps . at the initial collapse of dm gas in the central part",
    "is at first adiabatically compressed through accretion of ambient gas towards the center .",
    "eventually , a shock wave appears near the center and x - ray luminosity rapidly rises until temperature increases and reaches about virial temperature via shock heating . in the late stage , in contrast , the luminosity rises only gradually , since the inner region already emits strong x - rays .",
    "the gradual brightening is due partly to the expansion of the high temperature region and partly to increasing x - ray emissivity of gas as the results of continuous adiabatic compression the gas inside the shock .    if we compare two clusters with the same density fluctuation amplitudes at @xmath86 and with the same total masses but in different mean - density unvierses , the dm distribution is less concentrated in clusters in lower density universe .",
    "hence , x - ray luminosity of clusters rises more slowly than in higher density universe .",
    "initial gas temperature has some influence on the central gas density .",
    "higher initial temperature results in lower central density .",
    "this corresponds to the case that reheating of the icm by , e.g. , proto - galaxies is substantial .",
    "density distribution in the outer region and temperature profile inside the shock front are , however , hardly influenced by changes in the initial temperature .",
    "thus , the inclusion of reheating process modifies the scaling law between x - ray luminosity and temperature in the favorite way to reproduce the observed relation ( nfw ) .",
    "note that the epoch of the shock emergence depends on the initial specific entropy at the core ; in the presence of reheating process ( so that the initial gas temperature is @xmath175k ) , specific entropy at the core is already high enough , and so the appearance of shock may be delayed .    in table",
    "[ bertschinger ] we compare the time dependent properties of model a cluster and those of the self - similar solution by bertschinger ( 1985 ) .",
    "both behavior looks very similar .",
    "note that the self - similarity can be seen in all the calculated models .",
    "although einstein - de sitter universe is assumed in bertschinger ( 1985 ) , we find that the self - similarity can be found for cluster evolution in low density universe ( @xmath176 ) .    our results regarding the present profiles of density , temperature , and",
    "so on roughly coincide with those of the previous sph simulations ( evrard 1990 ; nfw )",
    ". however , the structure of the shock front , which was not well resolved in the previous sph simulations , is now clearly captured in the present mesh - code simulations ; our results show that hot gas of x - ray cg is separated with a definite boundary and that shock heating plays an important role for the heating process of icm .",
    "we confirmed the persistence of radial infall of gas after the passage of the shock front .",
    "this results in adiabatic compression of the inner parts , inducing gradual temperature increase .",
    "we also found time variations in the strengths of the shock due to a sound wave propagation over the entire cluster , which modulates the radial distributions of temperature and density with relative amplitudes of about 10 % . note that the property of the sound wave may depend on our assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "it is open to question how such sound wave behaves in a realistic three - dimensional situation ; i.e , when mass accretion takes place in a nonaxisymmetric way ( e.g. , by merger of multiple density condensations ) .",
    "if the temperature modulation will be observed with future x - ray mission ( such as astro - e ) , this can be used as a good probe to investigate the structure , especially , the mass distribution of cgs , since sound wave properties sensitively depend on the shape and the depth of the gravitational potential well , and thus on the dm mass distribution .",
