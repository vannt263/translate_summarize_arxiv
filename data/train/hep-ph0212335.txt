    "it has been shown that statistical - thermal models are able to reproduce the multiplicities measured in relativistic heavy - ion collisions with remarkable success .",
    "this is accomplished with a very small number of parameters the temperature , baryon - chemical potential , @xmath1 , and a factor measuring the degree of strangeness saturation , @xmath0 .",
    "as is now well known , there is very little difference between the temperatures observed in @xmath2 and relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the extracted strangeness saturation factor , @xmath0 , is however very different in @xmath2 and heavy - ion collisions . in this paper",
    "we focus on hadron multiplicities and extract the thermal parameters as a function of system - size and energy .    the recent study in @xcite ( cf .",
    "table iii therein ) impressively demonstrated that , with increasing system - size at sps energies , the strangeness saturation increases . in @xcite we have shown that at a beam energy of 158 agev , in collisions of lead - on - lead nuclei , the strangeness saturation continuously increases with centrality .",
    "however , strangeness ( as measured by fully - integrated kaon and antikaon multiplicities ) is clearly below saturation . a preliminary analysis @xcite of the centrality dependence at rhic energy of @xmath3 gev points to a further increase of strangeness towards saturation for central collisions of gold nuclei .",
    "an independent analysis @xcite confirms this finding .",
    "this paper is divided into several sections .",
    "firstly the system - size dependence of the thermal parameters is determined using 4@xmath4-yields from central c+c and si+si collisions  @xcite , and centrality - binned pb+pb collisions  @xcite at 158 agev at the cern sps . for comparison ,",
    "centrality - binned mid - rapidity yields from au+au collisions at @xmath3 gev  @xcite and pb+pb collisions at sps energy  @xcite are analysed , despite the danger in applying the thermal model to yields in a limited rapidity window .",
    "finally , the energy dependence of the thermal parameters is further elucidated by analysis of central pb+pb yields measured by na49 at 40 , 80 and 158 agev @xcite .",
    "in the thermal model , hadron multiplicities can be described @xcite by the grand - canonical partition function @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the statistical operator of the system , @xmath7 denotes the temperature , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the chemical potentials and corresponding conserved charges respectively . in the analysis of @xmath10-data , the net - zero strangeness and",
    "the baryon - to - electric charge ratio of the colliding nuclei constrain the components of @xmath11 .",
    "the particle numbers are given , in the boltzmann approximation , by @xmath12 where we include phenomenologically a strangeness saturation factor , @xmath0 , with @xmath13 the number of valence strange quarks and anti - quarks in species @xmath14 @xcite ( i.e. @xmath0 for the kaons and @xmath15 for @xmath16 ) to account for incomplete equilibration in this sector , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the breit - wigner distribution .",
    "the particle numbers to be compared with experiment are @xmath19 , due to decays of unstable particles with branching ratios @xmath20 . for small participant numbers ( typically @xmath21 below 40 )",
    ", one has to resort to a canonical or micro - canonical formalism @xcite .        in order to extract the system - size dependence of the thermal parameters we analyse @xmath10-multiplicities of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath16 and @xmath21 ( taken as the sum over all baryons ) in 6 centrality bins in the reaction pb+pb  @xcite ( at 158 agev ) and for central si+si and c+c collisions  @xcite at the same energy . our previous analyses @xcite of the pb+pb system included @xmath24 yields .",
    "they are excluded in this analysis in order that the pb- , c- and si systems be treated equivalently .",
    "no weak feed - down corrections have yet been applied to the peripheral pb- , or c- and si systems @xcite . due to the rather limited data set ,",
    "the freeze - out temperature was fixed at 165 mev , independent of centrality and colliding system .",
    "this is supported by a variety of fits to both heavy - ion and elementary collision systems in this energy regime  @xcite .",
    "owing to the size of the c- , si- and peripheral pb systems , strangeness was treated canonically in all systems . as shown in  @xcite , for systems of this size at sps energy , it is sufficient to treat the baryon- and charge content grand - canonically .",
    "the results are displayed in figs .",
    "[ f_gammas_sys_size ] and [ f_mub_sys_size ] with the specifics of each fit explained in the captions .",
    "the strangeness saturation factor , @xmath0 , shows an increasing trend with collision centrality in the pb+pb system , except possibly over the two most central bins ( see fig .",
    "[ f_gammas_sys_size ] ) .",
    "it is also clear that the c+c and si+si systems lie above the trend suggested by the pb+pb points .",
    "this suggests that peripheral pb+pb collisions are not equivalent , with respect to strangeness saturation , to central collisions of lighter nuclei with the same participant number . in the c+c and si+si systems",
    "the baryon chemical potential is also lower than in the peripheral pb+pb bins ( refer to fig .",
    "[ f_mub_sys_size ] ) .",
    "it should be stressed that the only direct baryon information we have at our disposal in this analysis is the number of participants .",
    "it would appear that , in the pb+pb system , @xmath1 decreases as the collisions become more central . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f_mub_sys_size ] , the inclusion of @xmath24 yields in the pb analysis ( squares ) leads to a roughly centrality - independent baryon chemical potential of approximately 250 mev . in order to investigate its interplay with @xmath0",
    ", we fixed @xmath1 at 250  mev in all collisions .",
    "this affected appreciably only the most central pb+pb bin , resulting in a monotonic increase in @xmath0 within the pb system .",
    "thus , the drop in @xmath0 over the most central bins of the pb system is driven by @xmath25 which , due to its small error relative to other species in the most central bin , is weighted heavily in a @xmath26-analysis . since the errors , particularly in the c and si systems have not yet been well - established  @xcite , we repeated the fits minimising the ` quadratic deviation ' @xcite defined by : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the experimental and model - predicted multiplicities of hadron species @xmath14 respectively .",
    "the results of this analysis are shown in figs .",
    "[ f_gammas_sys_size ] and [ f_mub_sys_size ] as triangles .",
    "again @xmath0 in the pb+pb system shows a monotonic trend , while the c+c and si+si systems still show a sizeable deviation from the peripheral pb points .",
    "this can not be attributed to rescattering , since it is more dominant in peripheral pb+pb than in central c+c and si+si reactions  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite it is shown that the strangeness enhancement , as measured by the ratios of strange to non - strange mesons , in these systems scales with @xmath30 , the fraction of participants which undergo multiple collisions .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ f_gammas_f2 ] , @xmath0 scales with this variable too .",
    "the strangeness saturation extracted from p+p collisions at @xmath31  gev  @xcite ( denoted in fig .  [ f_gammas_f2 ] by the square ) suggests a strong flattening off of @xmath0 for small systems .",
    "what is surprising is the approximate equivalence of @xmath30 and @xmath0 for a number of points in fig .",
    "[ f_gammas_sys_size ] ( @xmath30 in this figure is denoted by the diamonds ) . +      when applying the thermal model to @xmath10-data , many dynamical effects cancel out in ratios of the fully - integrated hadron yields @xcite .",
    "in particular , effects due to flow disappear if the freeze - out surface is characterized by a single temperature and chemical potential .",
    "when applying the thermal model to mid - rapidity data this is true only when the bjorken model  @xcite holds .",
    "furthermore , in a limited rapidity window there is no guarantee that the total strangeness should be zero , nor that the baryon - to - charge ratio in this kinematic region should be set by the colliding nuclei . in a grand canonical approach",
    "this affects the constraints on the chemical potentials . in the canonical formulation",
    "the ` canonical suppression volume ' ( i.e. the volume in which quantum numbers are exactly conserved and that used to calculate the densities ) and the ` normalisation volume ' ( i.e. the volume required to convert densities to yields ) are not necessarily the same .",
    "a further complication arises in the treatment of decays .",
    "the experimental yields include feed - down from heavier resonances into stable , final - state particles . with mid - rapidity data ,",
    "this requires careful consideration of the decay kinematics , as particles in a certain rapidity range will in general decay into particles in different kinematic windows .    despite these disclaimers we analyse the following mid - rapidity yields measured by the na49 and phenix collaborations :    \\i ) na49 mid - rapidity yields of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath32 and @xmath24 in the reaction pb(158 agev ) + pb in 6 centrality bins @xcite .",
    "\\ii ) phenix mid - rapidity densities of @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath33 in the reaction au + au at @xmath34 agev in 5 centrality bins  @xcite .",
    "the phenix yields were not corrected for weak decays .",
    "phenix estimate the probability for reconstructing protons from @xmath35 decays as prompt protons at 32% at @xmath36 = 1 gev / c @xcite .",
    "the phenix analysis was performed with both 0% and 50% feed - down from weak decays , while no weak feeding was included in the sps analysis . in all cases",
    "the grand - canonical formalism was applied , with the total strangeness set to zero but @xmath37 fit as a free parameter .    in fig .",
    "[ f_mid_rap ] the system - size dependence of @xmath0 at mid - rapidity is shown for sps ( left panel ) and rhic ( right panel ) . in the sps plot",
    "the results of our earlier analysis of fully - integrated na49 yields  @xcite are included for comparison .",
    "it is seen that @xmath0 , as extracted from the mid - rapidity na49 data , is well above that obtained from the analysis of the fully - integrated na49 yields . in order to exclude the possibility that the difference in the strangeness saturation extracted from the 4@xmath4- and mid - rapidity data analysed here is due solely to different strange hadrons included in the fits , the 4@xmath4 na49 analysis was repeated with",
    "the hidden - strangeness @xmath16 excluded . in this way the two na49 analyses are equivalent with respect to strange particles .",
    "this led to a slight decrease in @xmath0 in the most peripheral bins , and thus an even larger difference between mid - rapidity and fully - integrated results .",
    "thus , certainly at sps energies , the degree of strangeness saturation is far higher in the central rapidity region . included in the rhic plot of fig .",
    "[ f_mid_rap ] is @xmath30 .",
    "this fraction of multiply - struck participants parametrises the system - size dependence of the strangeness saturation factor in au+au collisions at rhic energy remarkably well .",
    "+      in order to further investigate the energy dependence of the thermal parameters we analyse the fully - integrated yields of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath35 and @xmath38 in central pb+pb collisions at 40 , 80 and 158 agev , supplemented with @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath16 multiplicities at 158 agev @xcite . in figs .",
    "[ f_gammas_e_dep ] and [ f_wrob_e_dep ] , @xmath0 and the wrblewski factor  @xcite , @xmath42 , which measures the ratio of newly created @xmath43 pairs to newly created non - strange valence quark pairs at the primary hadron level : @xmath44 are displayed as a function of the collision energy .",
    "included in the figures are the results of our earlier system - size analysis of the pb+pb system at cern sps and the au+au system at rhic  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the centrality cuts on the most central pb+pb collisions are slightly different at the various energies ( 7.2% at 40 and 80 agev , and 5% at 158 agev ) . in view of the system - size dependence extracted in the previous section , this will raise the 40 and 80 agev points relative to the 158 agev point . in fig .",
    "[ f_wrob_e_dep ] one observes that @xmath42 for central collisions decreases with collision energy from 40 agev ( in agreement with @xcite ) . within a given collision system",
    ", it shows a systematic increase with participant number , while remaining above the typical value of 0.2 seen in @xmath45 collisions  @xcite . with respect to @xmath0",
    "there is fairly good agreement between the most peripheral heavy - ion bins and the results from elementary systems of comparable energy  @xcite .    for comparison",
    "we also show the value of @xmath0 extracted from mid - rapidity pb+pb data  @xcite at 158 agev ( open circle ) in fig .",
    "[ f_gammas_e_dep ] .",
    "as can be seen , the strangeness saturation in the mid - rapidity region is clearly greater than that averaged over 4@xmath4 .",
    "in conclusion , the strangeness saturation factor , @xmath0 , has been shown to increase with participant number in the pb+pb system at the cern sps as well as the au+au system at rhic .",
    "central collisions of c+c and si+si at sps energies deviate , with respect to strangeness saturation , from peripheral pb+pb collisions .",
    "however , @xmath0 is seen to scale with the fraction of multiply - struck participants , @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , @xmath30 remarkably tracks the @xmath21-dependence of @xmath0 as extracted from mid - rapidity yields in au+au collisions at rhic . where both mid - rapidity and fully - integrated data was available , the degree of strangeness saturation observed at mid - rapidity",
