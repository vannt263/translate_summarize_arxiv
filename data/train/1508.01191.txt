    "collective intelligence ( ci ) practitioners face many challenges as collaboration , especially involving highly trained intellectuals , is not easy to manage .",
    "one of the important aspects of collaboration is inconsistency arising from different points of view on the same issue . according to @xcite , ``",
    "inconsistent knowledge management ( ikm ) is a subject which is the common point of knowledge management and conflict resolution .",
    "ikm deals with methods for reconciling inconsistent content of knowledge .",
    "inconsistency in the sense of logic has been known for a long time .",
    "inconsistency of this kind refers to a set of logical formulae which have no common model . '' and `` the need for knowledge inconsistency resolution arises in many practical applications of computer systems .",
    "this kind of inconsistency results from the use of various sources of knowledge in realizing practical tasks .",
    "these sources often are autonomous and they use different mechanisms for processing knowledge about the same real world .",
    "this can lead to inconsistency . ''",
    "unfortunately , inconsistency is often taken for a synonym of inaccuracy but it is a `` higher level '' concept .",
    "inconsistency indicates that inaccuracy of some sort is present in the system .",
    "certainly , inaccuracy by itself would not take place if we were aware of it .",
    "we will illustrate it in a humorous way .",
    "when a wrong phone call is placed , the caller usually apologizes by `` i am sorry , i have the wrong number '' and may hear in reply : `` if it is a wrong number , why have you dialed it ? ''",
    "of course we would have not dialed the number if we had known that it was wrong .",
    "in fact , the respondent is the one who detects the incorrectness , not the caller",
    ".    however , a self correction may also take place in some other cases , for example , via an analysis of our own assessments for inconsistency by comparing them in pairs .",
    "highly subjective stimuli often are present in the assessment of public safety or public satisfaction . similarly , decision making , as an outcome of mental processes ( cognitive process ) ,",
    "is also based on mostly subjective assessments for the selection of an action among several alternatives .",
    "we can compute the inconsistency indicator of our assessments ( subjective or not ) rarely getting zero which stands for fully consistent assessments .",
    "as the membership function of a fuzzy set is a generalization of the indicator function in classical sets , the inconsistency indicator is related to the degree of contradictions existing in the assessments . in fuzzy logic , the membership function represents the degree of truth .",
    "similarly , the inconsistency indicator is related to both the degree of inaccuracy and contradiction .",
    "degrees of truth are often confused with probabilities , although they are conceptually distinct .",
    "fuzzy truth represents membership in vaguely defined sets but not the likelihood of some event or condition .",
    "likewise , the inconsistency indicator is not a probability of contradictions but the degree of contradiction .    in our opinion ,",
    "pairwise comparisons method is one of the most feasible representations of collective intelligence .",
    "it also allows one to measure it , for example , by comparing ci with individual intelligence .",
    "( according to the online _ handbook of collective intelligence _ , hosted at the website of mit center of collective intelligence http://cci.mit.edu/research/index.html , measuring ci is one of two main projects for developing theories of ci . )",
    "pairwise comparisons are easy to use , but may require complex computations to interpret them properly .",
    "this is why we address the fundamental issue of scales of measure , which  in particular  may have an effect on feasibility of some computational schemes .",
    "comparing objects and concepts in pairs can be traced to the origin of science or even earlier  perhaps to the stone age .",
    "it is not hard to imagine that our ancestors must have compared `` chicken and fish '' , holding each of them in a separate hand , for trading purposes .",
    "the use of pairwise comparisons is still considered as one of the most puzzling , intriguing , and controversial scientific method although the first published use of pairwise comparisons ( pc ) is attributed to condorcet in 1785 ( see @xcite , four years before the french revolution ) .",
    "ramon llull , or raimundus lullus designed an election method around 1275 in @xcite .",
    "his approach promoted the use of pairwise comparisons .",
    "however , neither llull nor condorcet used a scale for pairwise comparisons .",
    "condorcet was the first who used a kind of binary version of pairwise comparisons to reflect the preference in the voting by the won - lost situation . in @xcite ,",
    "a psychological continuum was defined by thurstone in 1927 with the scale values as the medians of the distributions of judgments on the psychological continuum .    in @xcite , saaty proposed a finite ( nine point ) scale in 1977 . in @xcite , koczkodaj proposed a smaller five point scale with the distance - based inconsistency indicator .",
    "this smaller scale better fits the heuristic `` _ _ off by one grade or less _ _ '' for the acceptable level of inconsistency proposed in @xcite .",
    "we will show here that a new convexity finding for the first time supports the use of an even smaller scale .",
    "mathematically , an @xmath0 real matrix @xmath1 $ ] is a pairwise comparison ( pc ) matrix if @xmath2 and @xmath3 for all @xmath4 .",
    "elements @xmath5 represent a result of ( often subjectively ) comparing the @xmath6th alternative ( or stimuli ) with the @xmath7th alternative according to a given criterion .",
    "a pc matrix @xmath8 is consistent if @xmath9 for all @xmath10 it is easy to see that a pc matrix @xmath8 is consistent if and only if there exists a positive @xmath11-vector @xmath12 such that @xmath13 for a consistent pc matrix @xmath8 , the values @xmath14 serve as priorities or implicit weights of the importance of alternatives .",
    "thurstone s approach was extensively analyzed and elaborated on in the literature , in particular by luce and edwards @xcite in 1958 .",
    "the bottom line is that subjective quantitative assessments are not easy to provide .",
    "not only is the dependence between the stimuli and their assessments usually nonlinear , but the exact nature of the nonlinearity is in general unclear . in this context",
    ", a smaller scale is expected to generate a smaller error , for example by mitigating the deviation from nonlinearity .",
    "on page 236 in @xcite , authors wrote : w.j .",
    "mcgill is currently attempting to find a better way of respecting individual differences while still obtaining a `` universal scale '' .",
    "authors of this study have not been able to trace any publication of the late w.j .",
    "mcgill on the `` universal scale '' construction .",
    "however , the proposed smaller scale may be at least some kind of temporary solution as a reflection of `` the small is beautiful '' movement inspired by leopold kohr by his opposition to the `` cult of bigness '' in social organization .",
    "the smaller five - point scale better fits the heuristic ",
    "off by one grade or less \" for the acceptable level of the distance - based inconsistency ( as proposed in @xcite ) .",
    "we will show here that the new convexity finding , for the first time , supports the use of an even smaller scale .",
    "there are strong opponents of the pairwise comparisons method going as far as opposing the use of pairwise comparisons altogether .",
    "however , they forget that every measurement , e.g. , of length , is based on pairwise comparisons since we compare the measured object with some assumed unit . for example , one meter is the basic unit of length in the international system of units ( si ) .",
    "it was literally defined as a distance between two marks on a platinum - iridium bar .",
    "evidently , we are unable to eliminate pairwise comparisons from science hence we need to improve them . as we will demonstrate , it is the issue of scale ( in other words the input data ) and , as such , it can not be ignored .",
    "several mathematical methods have been proposed for finding the nearest consistent pairwise comparisons matrix for a given inconsistent pairwise comparisons matrix . in @xcite ,",
    "the eigenvector method was proposed in which @xmath12 is the principal eigenvector of @xmath8 .",
    "another class of approaches is based on optimization methods and proposes different ways of minimizing ( the size of ) the difference between @xmath8 and a consistent pc matrix .",
    "if the difference to be minimized is measured in the least - squares sense , i.e.  by the frobenius norm , then we get the least squares method presented by chu et al.@xcite .",
    "the problem can be written in the mathematical form ( we present the normalized version , see @xcite ) : @xmath15 since the @xmath0 matrices in the form of columnwise ordering can also be considered as @xmath16-dimensional vectors , ( say , by stacking the columns over each other ) , problem ( [ eq : lsm ] ) determines a consistent pc matrix closest to @xmath8 in the sense of the euclidean norm .",
    "unfortunately , problem ( [ eq : lsm ] ) may be a difficult nonconvex optimization problem with several possible local optima and with possible multiple isolated global optimal solutions @xcite .",
    "some authors state that problem ( [ eq : lsm ] ) has no special tractable form and is difficult to solve @xcite . in order to elude the difficulties caused by the nonconvexity of ( [ eq : lsm ] ) , several other ,",
    "more easily solvable problem forms are proposed to derive priority weights from an inconsistent pairwise comparison matrix .",
    "the weighted least squares method @xcite in the form of @xmath17 applies a convex quadratic optimization problem whose unique optimal solution is obtainable by solving a set of linear equations .",
    "the logarithmic least squares method @xcite in the form @xmath18 ^ 2 \\nonumber\\\\ { \\rm s.t . } & & \\prod_{i=1}^n w_i=1 , \\label{eq : llsm}\\\\                 & & w^{\\phantom { ! } } _ i>0,\\quad i=1,\\dots , n\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is ( because of constraints being linearizable ) a simple optimization problem whose unique solution is the geometric mean of the rows of matrix @xmath8 . for further approaches ,",
    "see @xcite and the references therein . however , we have to emphasize that the main purpose of many ( if not most ) optimization approaches was to exclude the difficulties caused by the possible nonconvexity of problem ( [ eq : lsm ] ) .",
    "it was usually done by sacrificing the natural approach of the euclidean distance minimization .    as with many other real - life situations",
    ", there is no possibility to decide which solution is the best without a clear objective function .",
    "for example , a `` formula one '' car is not the best vehicle for a family with five children but it may be hard to win a grand prix race with a family van .",
    "in fact , pairwise comparisons could be used for solving the dilemma of which approximation solution is the best for pc ( and for the family transportation problem ) .    the distance minimization approach ( [ eq : lsm ] ) is so natural that one may wonder why it was only recently revived in @xcite . the considerable computational complexity ( 100 hours cpu time for @xmath19 ) and",
    "the possibility of having multiple solutions ( and/or multiple local minima ) may be the reasonable explanation for not becoming popular in the past .",
    "problem ( [ eq : lsm ] ) has recently been solved in @xcite by reducing 100 hours of cpu ( or more likely , 150 days of the cpu time ) to milliseconds .",
    "it was asserted in @xcite that the multiple solutions are far enough from the ones that appear in the real - life situations .",
    "however , it appears that these assertions are mostly based on anecdotal evidence .",
    "more ( numerical and/or analytical ) research to elucidate this point would be helpful .",
    "as proved by flp @xcite , the necessary condition for the multiple solutions to appear is that the elements of the matrix @xmath8 are large enough . in @xcite , using the classic logarithmic transformation @xmath20 and the univariate function @xmath21 depending on the real parameter @xmath22 , problem ( [ eq : lsm ] ) can be transformed into the equivalent form @xmath23 it was also proved in @xcite , there exists an @xmath24 such that for any @xmath25 the univariate function @xmath26 of ( [ eq : b7 ] ) is strictly convex if and only if @xmath27 .",
    "consequently , in the case when the condition @xmath28 is fulfilled for all @xmath6 , @xmath7 , then ( [ eq : lsm ] ) can be transformed into the convex programming problem ( [ eq : b8 ] ) with a strictly convex objective function to be minimized ( see @xcite , proposition @xmath29 ) . in other words ,",
    "problem ( [ eq : lsm ] ) and the equivalent problem ( [ eq : b8 ] ) have a unique solution which can be found using standard local search methods .",
    "the above - mentioned constant equals to @xmath30 , which is a reasonable bound for many real - life problems .",
    "the above @xmath31 is not necessarily a strict threshold since its proof is based on the convexity of univariate functions ( see @xcite , proposition 2 , or see the appendix of the present paper for a compact low - tech argument ) and it is conceivable that the exact threshold for the sum of univariate functions is greater than @xmath31 .",
    "we know , however , that this threshold must be less than @xmath32 since , as shown by bozki @xcite , for any @xmath33 it is easy to construct a @xmath34 pc matrix with @xmath35 as the largest element and with multiple local minima .",
    "finally , even if some elements of a pc matrix are relatively large , it may still happen that ( [ eq : lsm ] ) has a single local minimum ; a sample sufficient condition is given in corollary @xmath29 of @xcite .",
    "a nonlinear programing solver ( available in excel and described in @xcite ) is good enough if ( [ eq : lsm ] ) has a single local minimum for a given a pc matrix @xmath8 .",
    "our incentive for postulating a restricted ratio scale for pairwise comparisons comes both from the guaranteed uniqueness in the interval determined in @xcite and from demonstrably possible ( by @xcite ) non - uniqueness outside of a just slightly larger interval .",
    "there have been several inconsistency indicators proposed .",
    "the distance - based inconsistency ( introduced in @xcite ) is the maximum over all triads @xmath36 of elements of @xmath8 ( with all indices @xmath37 distinct ) of their inconsistency indicators defined as :    @xmath38    convergence of this inconsistency was finally provided in @xcite ( an erlier attempt in @xcite had a hole in the proof of theorem 1 ) . a modification of the distance - based inconsistency was proposed in 2002 in @xcite .",
    "analysis of the eigenvalue - based and distance - based inconsistencies was well presented in @xcite .",
    "paying no attention to what we really process to get the best approximation , brings us what gigo , the informal rule of `` garbage in , garbage out '' , so nicely illustrates .",
    "this is why localizing the inconsistency and reducing it is so important .",
    "as of today , the scale size problem for the pc method has not been properly addressed .",
    "we postulate the use of a smaller rather than larger scale and more research to validate it .",
    "as mentioned earlier , an interesting property of pc matrices has been recently found in @xcite .",
    "namely , ( [ eq : lsm ] ) has a unique local ( thus global ) optimal solution and it can be easily obtained by local search techniques if @xmath39 holds for all @xmath40 , where the value @xmath31 is at least 3.330191 ( but can not be larger than @xmath32 , see @xcite ) . in our opinion , this finding has a fundamental importance for construction of any scale and we postulate the scale 1 to 3 ( 1/3 to 1 for inverses ) should be carefully looked at before a larger scale is considered . in the light of the property from @xcite ,",
    "finding the solution of ( [ eq : lsm ] ) would be easier and faster .",
    "this fact should shift the research of pairwise comparisons back toward ( [ eq : lsm ] ) for approximations of inconsistent pc matrices .",
    "this is a starting point for the distance minimization approaches .",
    "it is worth to note that pc method is for processing subjectivity expressed by quantitative data . for purely quantitative data ( reflecting objectively measurable even if possibly uncertain quantities ) , there are usually more precise methods ( e.g. , equations , systems of linear equations , pdes just to name a few of them ) . in general ,",
    "we are better prepared for processing quantitative data ( e.g. , real numbers ) than for qualitative data .",
    "a comparative scale is an ordinal or rank order scale that can also be referred to as a non - metric scale .",
    "respondents evaluate two or more objects at a time and objects are directly compared with one to another as part of the measuring process . in practice , using a moderate scale for expressing preferences makes perfect sense . when we ask someone to express his / her preference on the 0 to 100 scale , the natural tendency is to use numbers rounded to tens ( e.g. , 20 , 40 , 70 , ... ) rather than by using finer numbers .",
    "in fact , there are situations , such as being pregnant or not , with practically nothing between .",
    "the theory of scale types was proposed by stevens in @xcite .",
    "he claimed that any measurement in science was conducted using four different types of scales that he called `` nominal '' , `` ordinal '' , `` interval '' , and `` ratio '' .",
    "measurement is defined as `` the correlation of numbers with entities that are not numbers '' by the representational theory in @xcite . in the additive conjoint measurement ( independently discovered by the economist debreu in @xcite and by the mathematical psychologist luce and statistician tukey in @xcite )",
    ", numbers are assigned based on correspondences or similarities between the structure of number systems and the structure of qualitative systems .",
    "a property is quantitative if such structural similarities can be established .",
    "it is a stronger form of representational theory than of stevens , where numbers need only be assigned according to a rule .",
    "information theory recognizes that all data are inexact and statistical in nature .",
    "hubbard in @xcite , characterizes measurement as : `` a set of observations that reduce uncertainty where the result is expressed as a quantity . ''    in practice , we begin a measurement with an initial guess as to the value of a quantity , and then , by using various methods and instruments , try to reduce the uncertainty in the value .",
    "the information theory view , unlike the positivist representational theory , considers all measurements to be uncertain . instead of assigning one value ,",
    "a range of values is assigned to a measurement .",
    "this approach also implies that there is a continuum between estimation and measurement .",
    "the rasch model for measurement seems to be the relevant to pc with the decreased scale .",
    "he uses a logistic function ( or logistic curve , the most common sigmoid curve ) : @xmath41 .",
    "coincidentally , the exponential function was used in @xcite for his estimations of the upper bound of @xmath5 .",
    "we mentioned that the phenomenon of the scale reduction appears implicitly in the logarithmic least squares method @xcite as well .",
    "it is easy to see that in problem ( [ eq : llsm ] ) , it is not the original pc matrix @xmath8 which is approximated but @xmath42 which consists of the entries @xmath43 .",
    "[ example1 ]",
    "let us look at two scales : @xmath44 to @xmath45 and @xmath44 to @xmath46 :    [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the inconsistency of this table is computed by @xmath47 as @xmath48 .    the middle value in the triad @xmath49 $ ] is the upper bound of the scale @xmath44 to @xmath46 .",
    "the other two values ( @xmath29 ) are equal to the middle point value of the scale @xmath44 to @xmath46 .",
    "the same goes for all values of the triad @xmath50 $ ] on the scale 1 to 5 hence we can see that they somehow correspond to each other yet the inconsistencies are drastically different from each other and clearly unacceptable for the heuristic assumed in @xcite of @xmath51 for the first table and acceptable for the second table . needless to say , there is no canonical mapping from the scale 1 to 5 to the scale 1 to 3 .",
    "the table proposed above is admittedly ad hoc and we present it for demonstration purposes only .    evidently , more research is needed for this not so recent problem . in all likelihood",
    ", it was mentioned for the first time in @xcite in 1958 .",
    "most real - life projects using the pairwise comparisons method are impossible to replicate or compute for the new scale as the costs of such exercise would be substantial . it may take some time before a project with a double scale is launched and completed .",
    "the `` use of three '' for a comparison scale has a reflection in real life .",
    "probably the greatest support for the use of three as the upper limit for a scale comes from the grammar . our spoken and written language has evolved for thousands of years and grammar is at the core of each modern language . in his 1946 textbook @xcite ( which also nicely describes the degree of comparisons as they may be used in pc ) , bullions defines comparisons of adjectives in as :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ adjectives denoting qualities or properties capable of increase , and so of existing in different degrees , assume different forms to express a greater or less degree of such quality or property in one object compared with another , or with several others .",
    "these forms are three , and are appropriately denominated the positive , comparative , and superlative .",
    "some object to the positive being called a degree of comparison , because in its ordinary use it does not , like the comparative and superlative forms , necessarily involve comparison . and",
    "they think it more philosophical to say , that the degrees of comparison are only two , the comparative and superlative .",
    "this , however , with the appearance of greater exactness is little else than a change of words , and a change perhaps not for the better .",
    "if we define a degree of comparison as a form of the adjective which necessarily implies comparison , this change would be just , but this is not what grammarians mean , when they say there are three degrees of comparison .",
    "their meaning is that there are three forms of the adjective , each of which , when comparison is intended , expresses a different degree of the quality or attribute in the things compared : thus , if we compare wood , stone , and iron , with regard to their weight , we would say `` wood is heavy , stone heavier , and iron is the heaviest . ''",
    "each of these forms of the adjective in this comparison expresses a different degree of weight in the things compared , the positive heavy expresses one degree , the comparative heavier , another , and the superlative heaviest , a third , and of these the first is as essential an element in the comparison as the second , or the third .",
    "indeed there never can be comparison without the statement of at least two degrees , and of these the positive form of the adjective either expressed or implied , always expresses one .",
    "when we say `` wisdom is more precious than rubies , '' two degrees of value are compared , the one expressed by the comparative , `` more precious , '' the other necessarily implied .",

    "expressing subjective assessments with a high accuracy is really impossible , therefore a small comparison scale is appropriate . for example , expressing our pain on the scale of 1 to 100 , or even 1 to 10 , seems more difficult  and arguably less meaningful  than on the scale of 1 to 3 . in the past ,",

    ", we calculate the second derivative of @xmath26 and obtain @xmath74 roughly , @xmath26 will be convex whenever the expression in the outer parentheses is negative ( note that @xmath25 by hypothesis ) .",
