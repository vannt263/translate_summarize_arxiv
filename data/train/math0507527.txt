    "resolving sets have since been widely investigated @xcite , and arise in many diverse areas including network discovery and verification @xcite , robot navigation @xcite , connected joins in graphs @xcite , and strategies for the mastermind game @xcite .",
    "part of our motivation for studying the metric dimension of cartesian products is that in two of the above - mentioned applications , namely mastermind and coin weighing , the graphs that arise are in fact cartesian products .",
