    "a plya urn is an urn which contains balls of two colors ( black and white ) , and which is coupled with an initial configuration and a set of evolution rules .",
    "a step then consists in randomly picking a ball from the urn , placing it back , and depending on its color , adding a fixed number of black and/or white balls .",
    "the question is : what does the urn look like after a large number of steps ? this simple process has turned out to be extremely versatile , and has been used to model many different phenomena , such as population growth , epidemics , tree structures in computer science ( bst , @xmath0-trees ) , electoral campaigns , etc .",
    "this paper analyzes a class of balanced additive urns . _",
    "balanced _ urns are urns for which , at every step , the same constant number of balls is added .",
    "this property allows us to resort to a combinatorial treatment : enumerating all configurations using generating functions .",
    "such an approach , introduced by flajolet and his coauthors @xcite , is a departure from previous probabilistic methods . in _ additive",
    "_ urns , no ball is ever removed and the urn s size is strictly increasing .",
    "we specifically consider a class of balanced additive urns which has _ algebraic _ generating functions .    through the use of analytic combinatorics @xcite",
    ", we obtain precise probability results , including a gaussian limit law with rate of convergence , a local limit law and large deviation bounds .",
    "our analysis makes use of a multiple coalescing saddle - point method , which is not classical .",
    "as previously thought , analytic combinatorial methods can provide a wealth of valuable information that seems to be new .",
    "in addition , our results seem to reinforce the idea of a general theory for additive balanced urns .",
    "this paper comes as the continuation of flajolet s work on urns @xcite and @xcite ; these two papers were on subtractive and triangular urn models .",
    "of course , this topic has been thoroughly addressed through probabilistic means .",
    "we can cite introductory books on urns @xcite @xcite and an article @xcite ; on the topic of limit distribution for urns , janson s papers are a reference @xcite @xcite @xcite as is smythe s @xcite ; and on the topic of large additive urns , @xcite . from an analytic point of view , hwang et al.s paper @xcite considers `` _ _ diminishing _ _ '' urn models . and in direct relation to the present paper , we have obtained similar results @xcite on a class of additive balanced urns which is linked to some family of @xmath1-trees @xcite .    in sect .",
    "[ urn_system ] , we lay the ground work by introducing plya urn models as well as the main result of @xcite on the isomorphism between balanced urns and differential systems .",
    "then , in sect",
    ".  [ note1 ] , we introduce our urn class , which can be viewed as a population growth model .",
    "we establish that the generating function is algebraic and provide our first results on mean and variance .",
    "section  [ limit_th ] contains the main theorems of the paper regarding the limit distribution of our urn class .",
    "finally we state the propositions and lemmas required by the proof of the main theorems , and give some extensive details on the part involving multiple coalescing saddle - points .",
    "in plya s classical urn model , we have an urn containing balls of two different colors , black balls ( b type ) and white balls ( w  type ) .",
    "this system evolves with regards to particular rules ( at each step , add and/or discard black and/or white balls ) , and these rules are specified by a @xmath2 matrix @xmath3 we start with an initial configuration @xmath4 . at step @xmath5 , the urn contains @xmath6 black balls and @xmath7 white balls .",
    "the evolution between steps @xmath8 and @xmath9 is now described .",
    "we uniformly draw a ball from the urn , we look at its color and _ we put it back into the urn_. if the color is black , then we add @xmath10 black balls and @xmath11 white balls ; if the color is white , we add @xmath12 black balls and @xmath13 white balls .",
    "[ def_balance ] the urn ( [ urne22 ] ) is said to be _ balanced _ if the sums of its rows are constant , that is if @xmath14 .",
    "this parameter is called the _ balance _ of the urn , and denoted by @xmath15 .    at each step , we add @xmath15 balls in the urn .",
    "so , starting with @xmath16 balls in a balanced urn , we know that the total number of balls after @xmath8 steps will be @xmath17 .",
    "this balanced condition is the key requirement for using flajolet - dumas - puyhaubert differential systems .",
    "[ def_additive ] an urn is _ additive _ if all the coefficients in its rule matrix ( [ urne22 ] ) are strictly positive , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "no balls are ever removed from an additive urn . in our study , we focus on _ balanced additive _ urns .    the papers @xcite and @xcite introduce a new analytical and combinatorial approach to the study of these balanced urn models .",
    "the crucial starting point is an isomorphism theorem between the rules of an urn and a differential system .",
    "we briefly recall these results .",
    "[ def_histoire ] a _ history _ of length @xmath8 is a sequence of @xmath8 steps , obtained by @xmath8 successive draws from the urn .",
    "the _ exponential generating function of histories _ of the urn ( [ urne22 ] ) is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of histories of length @xmath8 starting at the configuration @xmath21 , and ending at a configuration @xmath22 .",
    "we will shorten this to @xmath23 when there is no ambiguity on the initial configuration @xmath21 .",

    "thus , the generating function @xmath41 is algebraic , as solution of a polynomial of degree @xmath42 .      from the polynomial equation ( [ eqn_algebric ] )",
    ", we can directly extract some precise information concerning the expression of the mean and the variance of the urn composition .",

    "[ moy_var ] let @xmath43 be the random variable counting the number of black balls b in the urn ( [ urne_note1 ] ) at step @xmath8 .",
