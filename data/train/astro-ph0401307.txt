    "most models for the early universe predict some small deviations from gaussianity ; non - standard models of inflation @xcite , cosmic strings ( see ref.@xcite for a review ) and point sources . detecting these small deviations would be of great importance for the understanding of the physics of the early universe .",
    "also systematic effects like a non - symmetric beam and noise could give rise to non - gaussian features .",
    "for this reason a non - gaussianity check could reveal whether the impact of the instrumental effects on the data of the experiment is well understood .",
    "+ the methods to search for non - gaussianity in the literature mainly concentrate on implementing the test in three different spaces : ( 1 ) in pixel space : the minkowski functionals @xcite ( which were used to set limits on the non - gaussianity in the wmap data @xcite ) , temperature correlation functions @xcite , the peak to peak correlation function @xcite , skewness and kurtosis of the temperature field @xcite and curvature properties @xcite , to mention a few . ( 2 ) in harmonic space : analysis of the bispectrum and its normalized version @xcite and the bispectrum in the flat sky approximation @xcite .",

    "phase mapping @xcite .",
    "applications to cobe , maxima and boomerang data have also drawn enormous attention and raised wide debate @xcite . the empirical process method @xcite .",

    "traditionally , these tests are performed separately in each space . in this article",
    ", we will take methods in pixel- ( the minkowski functionals ) , harmonic- ( the empirical process ) and wavelet - space ( skewness ) , and we will make a comparison for two different models of non - gaussianity .",
    "we will also combine the methods in order to improve the total power .",
    "it should be noted that all the procedures we consider are non - parametric , that is they do not assume any a priori knowledge about the nature of non - gaussianity .",
    "+ we will use these methods on 100 maps generated from a non - standard inflationary model @xcite and on 100 maps where we have included point sources .",
    "we assess the performance of the methods in the different spaces for the different types of non - gaussianity .",
    "we also propose a combined test which turns out to be more robust .",

    "to analyze a spherical map in terms of minkowski functionals , we consider the excursion sets , that is , the map subsets which exceed a given threshold value .",
    "the threshold is labelled @xmath0 and it is treated as an independent variable , on which these functionals depend .",
    "more precisely , considering the normalized random field of temperature fluctuations , @xmath1 we can define the hot region q as the ensemble of pixels @xmath2 higher than the @xmath3 level : @xmath4the three functionals of interest then are , up to constant factors @xcite :    \\1 ) _ area : _",
    "@xmath5 is the total area of all hot regions .",
    "\\2 ) _ boundary length : _ @xmath6 is proportional to the total length of the boundary between cold and hot regions    \\3 ) _ euler characteristic or genus : _",
    "@xmath7 , a purely topological quantity , counts the number of isolated hot regions minus the number of isolated cold regions , i.e. the number of connected components in q minus the number of holes.    the rationale behind these statistics can be explained from mathematical results in hadwiger ( 1959 ) ; in particular , these results can be interpreted by stating that all the morphological information of a convex body is contained in the minkowski functionals ( winitzki and kosowsky , 1997 ) ) ; here , by morphological we mean the properties which are invariant under translations and rotations and which are additive @xcite . the three statistics , normalized by the area density , can then be expressed as @xmath8where @xmath9 is the contour of the region @xmath10 ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the differential elements of @xmath10 and @xmath9 , respectively ; @xmath13 is the geodetic curvature of @xmath12 .",
    "the expected values for a given thresholds depends on a single parameter @xmath14 given for a gaussian field by @xcite : @xmath15 \\\\ m_{1}(\\nu)&=&\\frac{\\sqrt{\\tau}}{8 } \\",
    "exp\\left(-\\frac{\\nu^2}{2}\\right ) \\\\ m_{2}(\\nu)&=&\\frac{\\tau}{\\sqrt{8\\pi^3}}\\nu \\ exp\\left(-\\frac{\\nu^2}{2}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with : @xmath16 where semicolon indicates the covariant derivative on the sphere .    in the case of cmb ( [ eq : tau_der ] ) reduces to @xcite : @xmath17where @xmath18 is the angular power spectrum .",
    "an immediate consequence of the above formulae is that , although the expected value of the first minkowski functional is invariant with respect to the dependence structure of @xmath19 , for the second and third minkowski functional this is not the case and calibration for a given angular power spectrum @xmath20 is needed .",
    "moreover , even for the first minkowski functional , knowledge of the angular power spectrum is required for a monte carlo evaluation of its variance .",
    "this can be viewed as a drawback , and because of this some effort has been undertaken to provide at least some crude upper bound for the functionals variance ( winitzki and kosowsky ( 1997 ) ) .",
    "in order to estimate the three functionals we simulate a map of the cmb @xcite with a known power spectrum , and then we cut the maximum number of independent tangent planes of dimension @xmath21 @xmath22 ; in this way it is easy to calculate the values of the three minkowski functionals in the flat - sky limit , taking into account the possibility of gaps ( galactic cut , polar calottes ) .",
    "due to projection effects , finite pixel size and the dimension of the tangent planes , we find a deviation of the simulated values with respect to the analytical spherical predictions ( eqs.[m2_teor ] ) .",
    "note however that the shape of the curves is unaffected , which is not the case when non - gaussianities are present ( see fig . [",
    "fig : mink_fnl1000_mc ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mink_teor_mc ] we show a comparison between analytical expectation values and the values computed on the tangent planes .",
    "in order to test non - gaussianity we use a test defined by :    @xmath23    our procedure is as follows ;    * given an observed map , we estimate the power spectrum . * using the estimated power spectrum , we generate 200 gaussian realizations @xcite * for each map we calculate the minkowski functionals , using the tangent planes as described above * we calibrate the quantiles ( i.e. the threshold values at a given significance level ) using the monte carlo simulations ; the one and two sigma detection levels are shown in fig.[fig : hist_fnl300_mc ] . *",
    "we calculate our statistic ( [ eq : quantile ] ) from the observed map and compare the result with the monte - carlo calibration ; we are thus able to determine at which confidence level the map is gaussian or not .    , planck noise and beam 20. the small @xmath24 deviations are also shown.,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=264 ] , planck noise and beam 20. the small @xmath24 deviations are also shown.,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=264 ] , planck noise and beam 20. the small @xmath24 deviations are also shown.,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=264 ]    , planck noise and beam 20. the shaded bands show the @xmath24 deviations of the gaussian realizations and the error bars show the @xmath24 deviations for the non - gaussian maps.,width=604,height=755 ]",
    "the details of the empirical process approach to detect non - gaussianity in the cmb were given in @xcite . in short ,",
    "the method consists of a family of tests which focus on the total distribution of @xmath25 and check for dependencies between @xmath26 @xmath27-rows .",
    "the first step is to transform the spherical harmonic coefficients into variables @xmath28 which have an approximate uniform distribution between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , given that the @xmath25 were initially gaussian distributed .",
    "this is done using the smirnov transformation , defined as @xmath31where @xmath32 is the cumulative distribution function of a @xmath33 with @xmath34 degrees of freedom and @xmath35 are the power spectrum coefficients estimated from the data . the error introduced by using estimated @xmath36 instead of the real underlying @xmath37 is dealt with using a bias - subtraction , as described in @xcite .",
    "then the joint empirical distribution function for row @xmath27 is formed , @xmath38 where @xmath39 determines the spacing between the rows for which the dependencies are tested and @xmath40 denotes the difference in @xmath41 for row @xmath42 .",
    "the parameters @xmath43 run over the interval @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "the empirical process is expressed using the centered and rescaled @xmath45 given as @xmath46 the intuition behind this procedure is as follows : if the @xmath25s are gaussian , @xmath47 converges to a well - defined limiting process , whose distribution can be readily tabulated . on the other hand ,",
    "for non - gaussian @xmath25s @xmath48 and thereby @xmath47 will take ` high ' values over some parts of @xmath49-space .",
    "thus , the analysis of some appropriate functional of @xmath47 can be used to detect non - gaussianity . to combine the information over all multipoles into one statistic",
    ", we define @xmath50}\\widehat{g}_{\\ell, ... ,\\ell+\\delta _ { \\ell , k-1}}(\\alpha _ { 1}, ... ,\\alpha _ { k})\\text { , } \\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the highest multipole where the data is signal dominated .",
    "the method can then be summarized as follows : the distribution of @xmath52 is found using monte - carlo simulations of gaussian distributed @xmath25 .",
    "then , for a given observed set of @xmath25 , the value @xmath53 is found and compared to the distribution obtained from monte - carlo .",
    "the consistency of the data with a gaussian distribution can then be estimated to any suitable @xmath54-level . in @xcite",
    "this simple approach was extended in three different ways .",
    "first of all , the fact that the above explained estimator is not rotationally invariant is exploited , using the @xmath55 value averaged over many rotations .",
    "each rotation can be viewed as a resampling of the @xmath25 .",
    "secondly , we introduced three variations of the test , taking into account , not only the modulus of the @xmath25 but also the phases .",
    "finally , experimental effects like noise and galactic cut was accounted for using monte carlo calibration of the @xmath55 distribution with these effects included .",
    "it should be noted that the rotated maps are clearly dependent and the resulting statistic may thus depend on the shape of the angular power spectrum .",
    "a third space where one could look for non - gaussianity is the wavelet space .",
    "the use of wavelets for non - gaussianity tests of the cmb has been investigated by several authors @xcite and turns out to be a very powerful tool .",
    "we will here just briefly describe the wavelet method , and refer to the above references for more details .",
    "an isotropic wavelet can be defined as @xmath56 with the properties @xmath57 @xmath58    where @xmath59 , r represents a scale and b a translation .",
    "the fourier transform of the wavelet is represented by @xmath60 .",
    "we will focus on the mexican hat wavelets given by :    @xmath61e^{-|\\vec{x}-\\vec{b}|^2/2r^2}\\ ] ]    from the wavelet transform of a function @xmath62 one can obtain the wavelet coefficients : @xmath63 and if @xmath62 is gaussian , @xmath64 will be gaussian as well .",
    "we will here use the cmb temperature fluctuation field as the @xmath62 function .",
    "we will implement the non - gaussianity test in wavelet space as we did for the minkowski functionals :    * we generate a set of gaussian cmb maps for calibration and a set of non - gaussian maps for testing * we cut tangent planes @xmath65 * we calculate for each plane the coefficients @xmath64 * we evaluate the skewness of the wavelet coefficients for each sky . * finally , using the skewness of the wavelets from the gaussian maps , we define the one and two @xmath54 detection levels as described above for the other methods .",
    "this section aims at comparing the different methods described above . applying the methods on the same maps",
    ", we will first compare the number of detections .",
    "we will in this paper use the non - standard inflationary model described in @xcite which has the non - linear coupling parameter @xmath66 as a measure of the strength of non - gaussianity .",
    "we generated 100 ` observed ' skies with planck - like noise ( lfi 100 ghz ) , beam 20 , pixel - size @xmath67 6 ( nside 512 in healpix language ) , using a pure sachs - wolfe spectrum with @xmath66 values of 300 and 100 . in figures [ fig : mink_fnl1000_mc ] , [ fig : mink_fnl300_mc ] and [ fig : merge ] one can see the behavior of the minkowski functionals in the presence of a non - zero @xmath66 . in tables",

    "the power of the two procedures appears very close .",

    "we also simulated maps with point sources ( with noise and beam as given above ) to compare the power of the methods on a different kind of non - gaussianity .",

    "[ tab : sorg ] we show the results for the minkowski functionals .",
    "we see immediately that for this kind of non - gaussianity , the first minkowski functional is not sensitive , whereas the other two functionals show a good rejection rate .",

    "the first minkowski functional can be used to trace primordial non - gaussianity with little influence from the point sources . on the other hand",
