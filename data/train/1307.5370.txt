    "recent theoretical and experimental advances in dealing with small quantum systems has led to a growing interest in their mechanics and thermodynamics @xcite . a certain amount of progress has been connected with studies of the jarzynski equality @xcite and related fluctuation theorems @xcite .",
    "recent attention is mainly focused on the quantum version of these results .",
    "quantum analogues of the jarzynski equality were first studied by kurchan @xcite and tasaki @xcite . since then various topics connected with the fluctuation relations and the range of their validity and applicability were investigated .",
    "there exist many ways to approach the jarzynski equality @xcite .",
    "most of them are based on a dynamical description within an infinitesimal time scale . making use of the perturbation approach , the author of ref . @xcite",
    "analyzed quantum fluctuation and work - energy theorems that focus on the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "we will advocate here a different approach applicable for systems which can be described by discrete quantum operations .",
    "the formalism of quantum operations is one of the basic tools in studying dynamics of open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "fluctuation theorems for open quantum systems were recently considered in refs .",
    "@xcite . in particular ,",
    "some results have been shown to be valid in the case of unital quantum operations , while the general case of quantum systems with time evolution described by nonunital stochastic maps remained not fully understood .",
    "the main goal of this study is to relax the assumption of unitality and to generalize previous results for the entire class of stochastic maps , also called quantum channels .",
    "another task of the work is to introduce a model discrete quantum dynamics acting on a @xmath0-dimensional system , which forms a useful generalization of the amplitude damping channel acting on a two - level system .",
    "this nonunital map channel and its extensions describe effects of energy loss in quantum systems due to an interaction with an environment @xcite .",
    "investigation of possible effects due to deviations from unitality of the map become relevant in the context of possible experimental tests of quantum fluctuation theorems",
    ".    experimental study of fluctuation relations is easier in the classical regime @xcite .",
    "original formulations of the jarzynski equality and the crooks theorem were tested in experiments @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "experimental investigation of quantum fluctuation relations is still forthcoming , although some possible experimental schemes were already discussed @xcite .",
    "existing proposals often deal with a single particle undergoing an unitary time evolution .",
    "furthermore , current efforts to construct devices able to process quantum information might offer new possibilities to test quantum fluctuation relations . notably , quantum systems are very sensitive to interaction with an environment . in this regard ,",
    "fluctuations in systems with an arbitrary form of quantum evolution deserve theoretical analysis .",
    "therefore , we do not focus our attention on a specific class of unital channels , but we study the most general form of arbitrary quantum operations .",
    "the original formulations of the jarzynski equality and the tasaki  crooks fluctuation theorem remain valid under the assumption that changes of the system state are represented by a unital quantum operation @xcite .",
    "attention to bistochastic maps is natural , when we deal with the tasaki  crooks fluctuation theorem .",
    "indeed , its formulation involves both the forward quantum channel and its adjoint . if the latter channel preserves the trace , then the former one is necessarily unital .",

    "we provide a formulation of the jarzynski equality for arbitrary quantum operations .",
    "the contribution of our paper is twofold .",
    "first , we formulate a generalization of the jarzynski equality for a nonunital quantum channel .",
    "second , we investigate the problem for which the standard jarzynski equality remains valid nonunital quantum channels .    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
