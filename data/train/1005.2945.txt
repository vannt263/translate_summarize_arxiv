    "nearly all dynamical systems encountered in physics are local . time evolution is usually described by differential equations involving at most two time derivatives , and the @xmath3 dynamics depend only on a small amount of data specifying the state of the system at @xmath0 .",
    "there are , however , a number of reasons to entertain the possibility that locality is violated on microscopic scales , for example through the appearance of an infinite series of higher derivatives in the fundamental equations of motion .",
    "this type of nonlocality is a generic feature of many particle physics models including string theory @xcite , field theories living on noncommutative space - time @xcite and also models with a minimal length scale @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been argued that _ any _ quantum field theory ( qft ) of gravity must be nonlocal at the most fundamental level @xcite .",
    "the underlying nonlocality of string theory manifests itself strikingly through the infinite derivative structure of string field theory @xcite ( sft ) and also toy models such as the @xmath4-adic string @xcite or strings quantized on a random lattice @xcite .",
    "these constructions make it possible to study both nonperturbative and off - shell string physics , and have therefore played a key role in describing the decay of unstable d - brane configurations ( tachyon condensation ) .",
    "the dynamics of tachyon condensation @xcite are relevant for both formal string theory and also cosmology , because brane / anti - brane annihilation @xcite marks the endpoint of popular d - brane inflation models @xcite .    aside from their `` bottom up '' motivations , field theories with infinitely",
    "many derivatives are interesting due to improved ultra - violet ( uv ) behaviour @xcite and novel cosmological dynamics @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that nonlocal theories can support inflation even on a very steep potential , alleviating the fine tuning problems that plague inflationary model building .",
    "this mechanism leads to a robust prediction for large nongaussianity in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) which will be falsifiable ( or verifiable ! ) with planck @xcite .    in spite of these motivations , physical applications of nonlocal field theories",
    "are fraught with complications .",
    "perhaps the most serious concerns are the following .    1 .   * stability : * if the equation of motion admits more than two initial data then the `` extra '' degrees of freedom can be interpreted as physical excitations which carry wrong - sign kinetic energy and render the hamiltonian unbounded from below @xcite .",
    "the quantum theory contains ghosts , while the classical theory is plagued by ostrogradski ( higher derivative ) instabilities .",
    "* predictivity : * if the equation of motion requires _ infinitely _ many initial data , then there is an independent concern . by suitable choice of the infinite free parameters of the solution it might be possible to arrange for",
    "nearly _ any _ time dependence over an arbitrarily long interval . in this case",
    "the initial value problem would be completely bereft of predictivity .",
    "( throughout this paper we understand the word `` predictivity '' in this sense . )    clearly , very much is at stake .",
    "there is evidence that _ both _ of these problems might manifest themselves in string theory @xcite , for example through the wild oscillatory dynamics of tachyon condensation in flat space @xcite ( however , see @xcite ) .    as emphasized in @xcite , the presence of ghost - like instabilities in a nonlocal qft",
    "is intimately related to the structure of the initial value problem for the classical equations of motion . in this work ,",
    "we consider a new formulation of the initial value problem for a broad class of nonlocal theories which incorporate dissipation @xcite into the dynamics ( as is unavoidable in a cosmological context ) . we show that , in such models , the infinite tower of initial conditions @xmath5 at @xmath0 can be swapped for the freedom to fix the time evolution over some interval @xmath6 by requiring @xmath7\\ ] ] with @xmath8 the `` initial function '' and @xmath9 related to the energy scale at which nonlocal effects become important .",
    "this new formulation has considerable intuitive appeal since it makes manifest the nonlocal structure of the theory ; the cauchy surface has been `` smeared out '' over a finite interval set by the underlying scale of nonlocality .",
    "this mathematical re - formulation of the initial value problem suggests a rather novel new perspective on the key problems of predictivity and stability discussed above .",
    "although the initial function is arbitrary from a purely mathematical viewpoint , we point out that @xmath8 must be subjected to some auxiliary constraints in order to ensure that the @xmath10 evolution is physically sensible .",
    "for example , in the case of d - brane decay @xmath8 should be restricted to the physically meaningful region of the potential .",
    "the physical interpretation of these constraints is completely obfuscated in the `` old '' formulation of the initial value problem wherein one fixes infinitely many derivatives at @xmath0 .    remarkably , these mild physical restrictions on @xmath8 have the effect of constraining the theory to a stable subset of its solution space",
    ". although the hamiltonian is globally unbounded below , the unstable directions in phase space can not be accessed from an allowed initial configuration .",
    "this restriction is nonperturbative and retains information about the full nonlocal structure of the equations .",
    "moreover , the constrained theory makes robust predictions for the macroscopic ( @xmath11 ) dynamics .    in light of these results",
    ", we argue that there exists a broad class of stable , predictive nonlocal models whose equations of motion admit infinitely many initial data .",
    "a specific example is provided by d - brane decay in the background of a linear dilaton @xcite .",
    "previous examples of unstable solutions in this model were implicitly assuming unphysical initial conditions .",
    "this perspective on the nature of the instability was not appreciated in previous studies because the initial value problem was formulated in a highly unnatural way .",
    "our results help to establish the theoretical consistency of nonlocal cosmological models , and also provides a plausible mechanism by which the consistent inclusion of closed strings might enable sft to evade the ostrogradski instability .",
    "( this has been conjectured as a possible solution of the instability problems that plague sft , however , to our knowledge no concrete mechanism has previously been proposed . )",
    "since we do not rely on any intrinsically stringy properties of the theory , it will be straightforward to apply our approach to more general nonlocal models , in cosmology or elsewhere . at the practical level",
    ", our analysis provides a new tool - box of efficient and numerically stable techniques for solving nonlinear equations with infinitely many derivatives .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : delays ] we discuss some general properties of delayed differential equations which will be important for the subsequent analysis . in section [ sec : string ] we re - visit models of light - like d - brane decay in light of the formulation ( [ iff ] ) of the initial value problem , showing how macroscopic predictivity and stability can be salvaged . in section [ sec : qft ]",
    "we show how the simple - minded inclusion of dissipation can lead to delay - type nonlocality in a very general nonlocal qft framework and we show how the formulation ( [ iff ] ) of the initial value problem can be implemented . in section [ sec : timelike ] we study a particular model , cosmological d - brane decay , showing again how stability / predictivity can be salvaged . finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] , we conclude .",
    "in this section we will provide a brief discussion of some general features of models whose nonlocality arises purely through delay operators of the form @xmath12 . as we will see shortly , this type of nonlocality is often associated with the presence of some source of dissipation in the dynamics ( such as cosmological friction ) .      consider a prototype model whose dynamics are governed by the following delay differential equation @xmath13\\ ] ] here @xmath14 $ ] is some nonlinear forcing term and we assume that @xmath15 . equation ( [ dde ] ) is a nonlinear differential equation of infinite order , which is easy to see by noting the identity @xmath16 .",

    "( see @xcite for different approaches . )    the model ( [ dde ] ) belongs to a special class of nonlocal theories , referred to as having `` compact support '' in @xcite , which can be formulated in a surprisingly simple and intuitive manner using the method of steps ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the key observation is that equation ( [ dde ] ) defines a mapping from functions on the interval @xmath17 $ ] to the interval @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "we can therefore break the solution @xmath19 into segments @xmath20 defined over contiguous intervals of length @xmath21 .",
    "explicitly , we set @xmath22\\ ] ] where the integer @xmath23 labels the segment under consideration .",
    "this procedure for splitting a solution up into segments is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : segments ] . the dynamical equation ( [ dde ] )",

    "more on this shortly .",
    "= 0.5    starting from a given @xmath8 , the stepping procedure ( [ step ] ) is very easy to implement .",

    "the segments are joined we should impose boundary conditions that @xmath19 be continuous and as smooth as possible . since the differential operator on the left - hand - side of ( [ step ] ) is @xmath28-th order , we can demand that @xmath29 this matching should be performed at each knot : @xmath30 the method of steps is nonperturbative and solutions obtained using the recursion ( [ step ] ) are often much more efficient and numerically stable than those obtained using alternative approaches ( such as higher order perturbation theory @xcite or the diffusion equation technique @xcite ) .    notice",
    "that , in general , the @xmath28-th derivative of @xmath19 will be discontinuous at @xmath0 .",
    "this discontinuity will propagate into higher derivatives in subsequent segments .",
    "the only way to avoid this effect is by choosing @xmath8 to be a solution of ( [ dde ] ) . in practice , however , we can minimize derivative discontinuities by using perturbation theory to construct the initial function . none of our qualitative results in this work will rely on the smoothness properties of the solutions in any way .",

    "equation ( [ iff2 ] ) can be regarded as `` smearing out '' the cauchy surface over a finite width .",

    "if we have adopted perturbation theory ( instead of the method of steps ) it would have been most natural to specify the derivatives @xmath5 at @xmath0 , following @xcite .",
    "although both views of the initial value problem are mathematically valid , the formulation ( [ iff2 ] ) is much more natural here because it makes the manifest the delay - type nonlocality of the underlying theory .",
    "the initial value problem ( [ iff2 ] ) is unusual .",
    "the conventional notion of causality is violated , because the evolution depends on past history .",
    "suppose that we are observing the dynamics of @xmath19 over a time scale short compared to the delay , @xmath32 .",
    "equations ( [ dde ] ) and ( [ iff2 ] ) imply that the system will be _ directly _ influenced by events which occurred very far in the past , before the start of the `` experiment '' .",
    "no finite amount of information about the state of the system at @xmath0 is sufficient to uniquely determine the @xmath3 evolution .",
    "indeed , equation ( [ iff2 ] ) means that we could arrange for _ any _ time dependence over an interval @xmath6 , regardless of the specific details of the dynamical equation ( [ dde ] ) .",
    "clearly , the nonlocality of the system is associated with a breakdown of predictivity over _ microscopic _ scales , @xmath32 .    on the other hand , if we observe the system for a _ macroscopic _ time scale , @xmath11 , then the situation is different .",
    "we retain a weakened version of causality because the `` memory '' is small as compared to the dynamical scales of interest .",
    "we could hope to measure the evolution over an entire segment and use this as an initial function to robustly predict the subsequent dynamics .",
    "( in principle this still requires making infinitely many measurements and , in a realistic model , it might only be possible to reconstruct the initial function to some limited accuracy . any uncertainty in @xmath8",
    "propagates into all future predictions . in practice , this effect is usually tiny because the late - time dynamics are insensitive to the details of the initial function . )    notice that , although the initial function may be ambiguous in some circumstances , it is _ not _ completely arbitrary .",
    "we should subject @xmath8 to some auxiliary constraints in order to ensure that the @xmath33 evolution was sensible .",
    "the specific nature of these constraints will , obviously , depend on the system that we are modeling .",

    "in the last section we introduced a general class of models with delay - type nonlocality , equation ( [ dde ] ) .",
    "we argued that ( [ iff2 ] ) provides the most natural formulation of the initial value problem .",
    "let us now consider two explicit examples from string theory and show how this new perspective on the initial value problem provides invaluable insight into the key problems  stability and predictivity  discussed in the introduction .",
    "let us now consider an explicit example of the type ( [ dde ] ) whose nonlinear dynamics are particularly transparent .",
    "our example is based on @xmath4-adic string theory @xcite , a toy model of the bosonic string which is known to reproduce a number of key features of the full string theory .",
    "( see @xcite for a review of some of these features and @xcite for a discussion of the @xmath4-adic theory at finite temperature and implications for the cosmological constant problem . )",

    "finally , let us comment on a `` priviledged '' class of initial functions .",
    "if we wish to minimize derivative singularities ( which are presumably unphysical ) , we should choose @xmath49 to be an approximate solution of the equation ( [ light_kg ] ) . for solutions rolling away from the maximum , we have a one - parameter family of such functions : @xmath115 where @xmath116 quantifies the initial displacement . with this choice ,",
    "the condition ( [ sft_constraint2 ] ) becomes unnecessary , because the dynamical equation ( [ light_kg ] ) forces solutions near the maximum to grow monotonically . the possibility to roll down",
    "the unbounded side of the potential while satisfying ( [ sft_constraint ] ) arises _ only _ for initial functions that are very far from being solutions of ( [ light_kg ] ) .",
    "hence , this possibility will typically also be associated with unphysical derivative singularities .",
    "the dynamics illustrated in fig .  [ fig : padic ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : sft ] are quite remarkable . in both cases",
    "the hamiltonian is unbounded from below .",
    "nevertheless , nonlinear solutions can not access the unstable directions in phase space starting from an `` allowed '' initial function @xmath49 .",
    "the constraint which must be imposed on @xmath49 in order to obtain sensible late - time evolution is _ extremely _ mild : it amounts to restricting the tachyon to the physically meaningful region of the potential over an interval comparable to the microscopic scale of nonlocality .",
    "these mild physical restrictions on @xmath49 have the effect of constraining the theory to a stable subset of its solution space . that this might be possible",
    "has been suggested previously , for example by woodard and eliezer in @xcite .",
    "the approach employed here has the advantage of being completely nonperturbative and also physically well - motivated .",
    "moreover , our solutions depend on infinitely many free coefficients and , in this sense , retain information about the full nonlocal structure of the model .",
    "( hence , our approach is different from perturbative localization . )",
    "suppose that we had adopted a different view of the initial value problem : fixing infinitely many derivatives @xmath5 at @xmath0 , instead of the initial function formulation ( [ iff2 ] ) .",
    "in this picture we would have uncovered an `` island of stability '' in initial condition space which leads to stable late - time dynamics .",
    "constraining the theory to the island of stability requires a seemingly delicate and contrived tuning amongst the infinite tower of initial conditions .",
    "however , this tuning _ seems _ contrived only because one is using a highly unnatural formulation of the initial value problem . in light of the initial function formulation ( [ iff2 ] )",
    "we see that , in fact , the constraints imposed by late - time stability are very mild .    what becomes of predictivity in our delayed models ( [ padic_kg ] ) and ( [ light_kg ] ) ? as discussed in section [ sec : delays ] , there is a breakdown of predictivity on _ microscopic _ scales , @xmath117 .",
    "in essence , this occurs because our ignorance about the past history of the system makes the initial function @xmath49 inherently ambiguous .",
    "however , as we have seen , the late - time dynamics are largely insensitive to @xmath49 , provided it belongs to the class of allowed initial functions . hence , we are still able to recover predictivity on _ macroscopic _ scales , @xmath118 .",
    "we view the breakdown of microscopic predictivity as a necessary feature of working with a fundamentally nonlocal theory .",
    "indeed , it seems quite natural : we should not expect to be able to unambiguously resolve dynamics on times comparable to the underlying scale of nonlocality .",
    "obviously , our conclusions about the nonperturbative stability of equations ( [ padic_kg ] ) and ( [ light_kg ] ) are purely classical .",
    "one might worry that instabilities re - appear at the loop level ( see @xcite for a related discussion ) or that the tachyon field @xmath52 can tunnel to the unbounded region of the potential , violating the physical restrictions ( [ padic_constraint ] ) and ( [ sft_constraint ] ) .",
    "we note , however , that in string theory the situation may be rather subtle .",
    "it is not clear if the physical degree of freedom associated with the tachyon field even _ exists _ on the unbounded region of the potential , or at the local minimum .",
    "somehow encodes the closed string gas which is the outcome of the brane decay @xcite or it may simply be that the @xmath52 disappears from the theory .",
    "the latter interpretation is similar to what happens to the inflaton field during brane / anti - brane inflation @xcite . at the end of inflation ,",
    "the mobile brane annihilates with its anti - brane and the inflaton field ( corresponding to the inter - brane separation ) no longer exists as a physical state in the theory . ]",
    "to summarize : the string theory models ( [ padic_kg ] ) and ( [ light_kg ] ) are nonperturbatively stable and make unambiguous predictions over time scales large compared to the delay , provided @xmath8 belongs to a class of allowed initial function .",

    "a much better approach is to represent the quantity @xmath185 using an expansion in chebyshev polynomials . when this expansion is truncated to order @xmath188 ( with @xmath28 integer ) then the pseudo - differential operator @xmath184 is equivalent to the partial sum @xmath189 and is straightforward to implement numerically .    when the dissipation is sufficient to allow the field to settle down to the minimum at late times , then our iterative solution of ( [ delayed_sft ] ) is very efficient and numerically stable , a significant improvement over higher order perturbation theory or the diffusion equation formulation ( of course , our method is also considerably less general than those alternative approaches ) .",

    "thus , our results may provide a plausible mechanism by which the consistent dynamical inclusion of closed strings could allow sft to evade the ostrogradski instability . at the more practical level",
    ", this general prescription helps to establish the viability of nonlocal cosmological models .",
    "it has been argued previously that the dynamics of tachyon condensation are stable for the special case where @xmath195 as @xmath196 .",

    "it is not clear if demanding that the field sit at an unstable maximum can be consistent with quantum mechanics ( or , for that matter , macroscopic predictivity ) .",
    "it should therefore be emphasized that our class of `` allowed '' initial functions is much broader than this very special subset of solution space .",
    "we only require certain qualitative restrictions on the dynamics of @xmath19 over a microscopic interval @xmath197 . moreover , our solutions depend on infinitely many free parameters and , in this sense , encode information about the full nonlocal structure of the equations .",

    "moreover , the constrained theory makes robust predictions for dynamics on macroscopic scales .",
    "although our claims are limited only to a small number of specific examples , we expect that similar results might be possible more generally .",
    "it is our view that these restrictions on the initial function should be viewed as a part of the definition of the theory .",

    "both the cutkowski et al .",
    "contour deformation @xcite and also the hertog and hawking @xcite approach are , classically , equivalent to adopting stability as a future boundary condition .",
    "both these approaches lead to a violation of microscopic causality , however , it is thought that macroscopic causality survives @xcite . in the initial function formulation",
    "we have an elegant and physically well - motivated way to impose late - time stability for models with infinitely many derivatives .",
    "our approach is nonperturbative and retains information about the full nonlocal structure of the theory .",
    "notice that microscopic causality is _ manifestly _ violated in this formulation of the initial value problem .",
    "we view this , along with the breakdown of microscopic predictivity , as a necessary feature of working with a fundamentally nonlocal theory .",

    "it is not our goal to claim that nonlocal models are generically sensible or phenomenologically viable .",
    "rather , we believe that fundamental nonlocality is ubiquitous in well - motivated microscopic models and , therefore , it behooves us to try to understand such constructions from a general perspective . by studying the connection between dissipation and delays , we have arrived at a new formulation of the initial value problem and a novel new perspective on the key issues of stability and predictivity .",
    "these general lessons may be applied in a variety of contexts .",
    "for example , the rolling open string tachyon is , physically , supposed to be decaying into closed string excitations @xcite which are usually _ not _ taken into account in sft .",
    "plausibly , the dissipation induced by this type of particle production has a dynamical effect which is similar to the dilaton gradient in section [ sec : string ] or the cosmological friction in section [ sec : timelike ] .",
    "thus , we have elucidated a mechanism by which the consistent inclusion of closed strings might enable sft to escape the ostrogradski instability .",
    "a strength of our approach is that we do not rely on any intrinsically stringy features of the underlying model .",
    "thus , our results may readily be applied to more general nonlocal qft models ( in particular , to nonlocal cosmological models ) .",
    "there are a number of directions for future work on this subject .",

    "it would be very interesting to understand the connection between dissipation and delays in more general models , for example where the coefficient of dissipation is time - dependent ( as would arise in a self - consistent cosmology ) .",
    "our analysis has been entirely classical , which is an obvious limitation .",
    "instabilities might re - appear at the loop level , or it might be that the field can tunnel quantum mechanically to some unstable configuration even when the unstable directions in phase space are not classically accessible from an allowed initial state ( perhaps similarly to @xcite ) . at the current level of understanding , it seems that perturbation theory is best suited to study quantization while the method of steps is best suited to study nonperturbative dynamics in the classical regime . however , it might be possible to incorporate quantization directly into the delayed formulation .",

    "we write the each constituent field as @xmath209 and expand the lagrangian ( [ multi ] ) order - by - order in perturbation theory @xmath210 where the quadratic part @xmath211 gives the linearized equations of motion and the higher order contributions encode the effects of interactions .",
    "the quadratic lagrangian decomposes into constituents as @xmath212 obviously the quadratic part of the hamiltonian must also admit a similar decomposition @xmath213 where each @xmath214 is constructed from @xmath215 .",
    "under what conditions can the perturbative hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) hamiltonian be bounded below ?",
    "if @xmath216 for any @xmath131 then @xmath215 must depend non - degenerately on time derivatives higher than than first order . by the ostrogradski theorem @xcite , it follows that @xmath214 must be unbounded below .",
    "hence , only theories with @xmath217 for all @xmath131 yield a bounded hamiltonian . in this case the coefficient @xmath138 can be computed easily from the residues of the propagator at the pole @xmath218 : @xmath219 ( the contour @xmath220 only encloses the pole at @xmath221 . )",
    "if any @xmath138 are negative , then ( [ multi ] ) must contain ghosts .",
    "if @xmath222 then , because @xmath223 is analytic , the residues must flip sign and some @xmath224 will be unbounded below .",
    "therefore the only possibility to construct a perturbatively ghost - free theory is when the propagator @xmath225 contains at most a single pole .",
    "we have implicitly assumed that @xmath218 is real valued for all @xmath131 .",
    "the case of complex mass - squared is slightly more subtle since now the @xmath138 coefficients are complex , as are the fields @xmath226 .",
    "hermiticity of the action requires that such complex poles arise in conjugate pairs , so that if @xmath227 is a zero of @xmath125 than so must be @xmath228 .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath229 and @xmath230 are complex conjugate pairs .",
    "then , reality of the solution implies that @xmath231 and the relevant part of the lagrangian is @xmath232 where @xmath233 denotes the complex conjugate of the preceding term and in the second equality we have defined @xmath234 so that the indices @xmath235 run over real and imaginary parts .",
    "the kinetic term can be diagonalized by a rotation @xmath236 .",
    "it is easy to verify that one eigenvalues of @xmath237 is always negative and the hamiltonian is unbounded below .    to summarize the results of this appendix : we have shown that a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for ( [ proto ] ) to yield a perturbatively stable hamiltonian is that the propagator @xmath225 has at most a single pole . in this case",
    "the theory describes only a single degree of freedom and the equation of motion ( [ kg ] ) requires only two initial data .",
    "has isolated poles or branch cuts .",
    "] absent the imposition of some constraints ( for example on the initial function @xmath8 or following @xcite ) ghost - like constituent excitations will lead to catastrophic classical instabilities and vacuum decay in the quantum theory .",
    "see @xcite for stringent observational constraints on the existence of physical ghost fields .",
    "there is one scenario where the analysis of this appendix can give very misleading results : the case where @xmath45 is a surface of degeneracy for the theory ( [ proto ] ) . in this case",
    "the propagator obtained in a naive perturbation theory about @xmath45 will have less poles than the total number of physical degrees of freedom in the theory .",
    "this situation actually occurs for the level truncation of sft , see appendix b for a review .",
    "it is sometime incorrectly argued that ( [ sft_kg ] ) admits only two initial conditions .",
    "this specious conclusion is reached by perturbing about the constant solution @xmath45 , which corresponds to the unstable maximum of the potential .",
    "writing @xmath238 we have @xmath239 to linear order in @xmath67 .",
    "the generatrix is @xmath240 which has only a single zero corresponding to a tachyonic excitation with mass - squared @xmath241 ( in string units ) . at higher order in perturbation theory the counting of initial data",
    "is the same .",
    "however , this conclusion is very misleading .",
    "notice that perturbing about the _ other _ critical point gives a _ different _ answer .",
    "writing @xmath242 and linearizing in @xmath100 we obtain @xmath243 \\delta \\phi = 0\\ ] ] the generatrix is now @xmath244 which has infinitely many zeroes @xmath245 given by @xmath246\\ ] ] where @xmath247 and @xmath248 denotes the branches of the lambert - w function .",
    "the spectrum ( [ mn ] ) corresponds to an infinite tower of constituent physical states with complex mass - squared .",
    "correspondingly , equation ( [ another_pert ] ) admits infinitely many initial conditions . in the appendix of @xcite",
    "we showed how to construct solutions of ( [ sft_kg ] ) near @xmath45 which depend on infinitely many free coefficients . using the results of appendix a",
    ", it follows that the hamiltonian associated with ( [ sft ] ) must be unbounded below .",
    "perturbing about different critical points of the potential we found different numbers of initial conditions .",
    "this is because @xmath45 is a surface of degeneracy for the equation of motion ( [ sft_kg ] ) @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has nothing to do with the nonlocal structure of the theory .. the euler - lagrange equation is fourth order in time derivatives and hence generic solutions admit four initial data .",
    "however , on the surface @xmath249 the character of the equation of motion changes : instead of determining @xmath250 in terms of lower order derivatives it instead becomes a constraint on the lower derivatives .",
    "thus , solutions which start at the point @xmath249 contain only three free coefficients . ]    the fact that ( [ sft ] ) allows for negative kinetic energy can not be doubted .",
    "time - dependent solutions in flat space have been shown to move _ higher _ on the potential than their starting point , without difficulty @xcite .",
    "since energy is conserved in this rolling process , it follows that the kinetic energy _ must _ be negative .",
    "moreover , generic solution of ( [ sft_kg ] ) undergo erratic oscillations with divergent frequency and amplitude , the hallmark behaviour of an ostrogradski - sick theory .",
    "the erratic time dependence of rolling tachyon solutions is properly understood as the _ symptom _ of a much deeper problem with sft .",
