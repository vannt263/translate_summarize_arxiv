    "a question of central interest from both theoretical and applied points of view in dynamical systems is the following : given a deterministic dynamical system that admits a sinai - ruelle - bowen ( srb ) measure , how does the srb measure change if the original system gets perturbed , perhaps randomly ?",
    "it is known that in certain situations the srb measure changes smoothly and a formula of such a  derivative \" can be obtained @xcite .",
    "this is called the linear response formula .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a recent survey about this area of research and to the most recent articles on linear response for intermittent maps @xcite . from a rigorous computational point of view",
    "there are no results in the literature that approximate the response of an srb measure up to a pre - specified error in a suitable topology .",
    "our goal in this paper is to pioneer this direction of research and to provide tools to investigate the changes in the statistical properties of families of systems .",
    "applications may range from the identification of tipping points in the statistical behaviour of systems studied in applications , such as the ones considered in @xcite , to checking whether a family of systems has decreasing or increasing entropy , see for example the problems considered in @xcite and their relation to number theory .",
    "our computational approach is based on finding a suitable finite rank approximation of the transfer operator associated with the original system .",
    "such techniques have proved to be computationally robust and to be successful when approximating srb measures of uniformly expanding systems @xcite , ( piecewise ) uniformly hyperbolic systems @xcite , and one - dimensional non - uniformly expanding maps @xcite .",
    "it has also proved to be a successful approach in approximating spectral data @xcite and limiting distributions of dynamical systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that suitable discretization schemes can be used to approximate linear response .",
    "the problem that we face in our rigorous approximation is is two - fold .",
    "the first is functional analytic . in particular",
    ", we need to find suitable discretization schemes that preserve the regularity of the function space(s ) where the transfer operator acts , and which can approximate the original transfer operator .",
    "the second is computational . in particular",
    ", the computational approach should be amenable to tracking all the round - off errors made by the computer .",
    "in section [ sec1 ] we present a general setting in which the formula corresponding to the linear response can be obtained . in this section",
    "we also show how the formula of such derivative can be rigorously computed using a computer . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we show how the algorithm can be implemented in the case of expanding maps . in particular , for suitable banach spaces we find suitable discretization schemes that achieve the goal in the case of expanding circle maps .",
    "in section [ noise ] we apply our results to stochastic perturbations of expanding circle maps and we present an example where we compute , up to a pre - specified error in the @xmath1 topology , the linear response of an expanding circle map under stochastic perturbations . in section [ sec : deterministic ] we apply our results to a deterministic perturbation of an expanding circle map . in this example",
    "the exact response can be computed analytically .",
