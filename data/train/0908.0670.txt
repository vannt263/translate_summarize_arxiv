    "that our theory is formulated without the terminology of root systems .",
    "however this realization gives a new insight in the theory of mzvs , and has some applications .",

    "in this section , we discuss double and triple zeta values . the results in this section are included in our main theorem , but we insert this section so that the readers can easily catch the essence of our idea from the description of these simple examples .",
    "first we consider the double zeta case . from",
    ", we see that spp for @xmath111 gives @xmath112 which is mapped to @xmath113 via the @xmath36-map for @xmath114 with @xmath115 .",
    "on the other hand , we know the following partial fraction decomposition : @xmath116 as a relation for formal rational functions , which can be easily proved by induction ( see , for example , ( * ? ? ? * ( 1.6 ) ) , @xcite ) . from",

    "note that euler already noticed the correspondence between and ( see borwein et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",

    "therefore we see that indeed holds , that is , @xmath130 hence we obtain the case @xmath131 of in theorem [ t-2 - 3 ] .",
    "moreover implies that the right - hand side of is mapped to the right - hand side of via the @xmath36-map .",
    "therefore the left - hand side of should be mapped to the left - hand side of via the @xmath36-map , that is @xmath132 in section [ sec-1 ] , we assume as a special case of , and deduce the correspondence of the left - hand sides of and . here we proceed reversely to obtain as a conclusion .",
    "hence the triple case in theorem [ t-2 - 5 ] .",
    "arakawa and kaneko @xcite studied double shuffle relations for multiple @xmath133-values by considering their own algebraic setup .",
    "for example , as a shuffle product relation , it is shown that @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 for @xmath137 and @xmath138 with @xmath139 .",
    "similarly to the above consideration , it is clear that can be deduced from .",
    "the definition of the shuffle product @xmath35 for multiple @xmath133-values is essentially the same as that for mzvs .",
    "therefore we can see that spp for multiple @xmath133-values corresponds to that of partial fraction decompositions of multiple @xmath133-functions of root systems studied in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will give the proofs of results stated in section [ sec-2 ] .",
    "we will prove this proposition by induction on @xmath140 . in the case",
    "@xmath141 , namely @xmath142 , the assertion implies .",

    "hence we have the assertion .",
    "now we consider the general case . here",
    "we need to check the following three cases :    ( case1 ) @xmath149 and @xmath150 ,    ( case2 ) @xmath151 and @xmath152 ,    ( case3 ) @xmath151 and @xmath150 .",
    "+ first we consider case 1 . since @xmath149 , namely @xmath153 , it follows from that @xmath154 by the assumption of induction in the case of @xmath155 , the second term on the right - hand side is @xmath156 by putting @xmath157 in the first sum on the left - hand side and using @xmath158 .",
    "hence , by , we obtain in case 1 .",
    "similarly , we can obtain in case 2 .",
    "now we consider case 3 . from and the assumption of induction in the case of @xmath155 , we have @xmath159 replace @xmath160 by @xmath161 in the second and the third sums on the right - hand side of , and use the relation @xmath162 in order to unite the first and the third sums , and the second and the fourth sums , respectively .",
    "then , noting @xmath163 , we obtain in the case of @xmath164 .",
    "thus , by induction , we complete the proof of proposition [ p-2 - 2 ] .    for our assertion of the former part of theorem [ t-2 - 3 ] , we first prove that @xmath165 where @xmath166 and @xmath167 otherwise .",
    "in fact , by replacing @xmath168 by @xmath169 on the right - hand side of , we can see that @xmath170 comparing and with @xmath171 , we see that @xmath172 and @xmath173 correspond to @xmath174 and @xmath175 , respectively .",
    "therefore we clearly obtain .",
    "now we prove @xmath176 by induction on @xmath140 @xmath177 .",
    "we first consider the case @xmath141 , that is , @xmath178 . from and , we have @xmath179 using the partial fraction decomposition with @xmath126 and @xmath180 , we see that the right - hand side of coincides with @xmath181 this implies in the case @xmath141 .",
    "next , we consider the general case . mapping each side of via the @xmath36-map ,",
    "we have @xmath182 using the assumption of induction , we find that the right - hand side of is @xmath183 on the right - hand side , we rewrite @xmath184 to @xmath185 in the first part , and to @xmath186 in the second part . then , by using the partial fraction decomposition of with @xmath187 and @xmath188 , we obtain .",
    "thus we obtain the proof of the former part .",
    "the element @xmath189 is , if we first apply the step of spp and then operate the @xmath36-map , transformed to the right - hand side of . on the other hand ,",
    "the same element is transformed to the right - hand side of via the @xmath36-map , and then to by partial fraction decompositions .",
    "this implies that the diagram of procedures in remark [ r-2 - 4 ] is commutative .",
    "thus we obtain the latter part of our assertion .",
    "we complete the proof .",
    "the explicit correspondence between spp and the procedure of partial fraction decompositions is given in .",
    "it is to be emphasized that we can successfully formulate the proof of theorem [ t-2 - 3 ] , especially and , because we have the framework of zeta - functions of root systems defined by , which is larger than the framework of mzvs .    in the above proofs of proposition [ p-2 - 2 ] and theorem [ t-2 - 3 ] , we only used definition and the linearity of the @xmath36-map . setting @xmath96 in",
    ", we immediately obtain , that is , .",
    "this is hence a proof of without using drinfeld integral expressions for mzvs . on the other hand",
    ", hoffman proved without using ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem 4.2 ) ) .",
    "therefore the double shuffle relation can be deduced without using .",
    "lastly , in @xcite , the regularized @xmath36-map @xmath103 is constructed from @xmath36 without using .",
    "hence the latter assertion of theorem [ t-2 - 5 ] follows .",
    "as stated in section [ sec-1 ] , equation is called the double shuffle relation for mzvs .",
    "based on this viewpoint and from the observations in the previous sections , we can give some functional relations for zeta - functions of root systems of @xmath56 type which include double shuffle relations . in this section",
    "we explain the principle of the method by illustrating the triple and the quadruple cases in detail .    from theorem [ t-2 - 5 ]",
    ", we can obtain , that is , by only using the partial fraction decompositions .",
    "therefore , for example , we see that holds for @xmath190 with @xmath52 and @xmath191 with @xmath192 , namely @xmath193    similarly , we obtain the following .    [ l-5 - 1 ] for @xmath194 with @xmath195 and @xmath196 with @xmath197 , @xmath198 holds .    from , we obtain @xmath199 by in theorem [ t-2 - 3 ] and in theorem [ t-2 - 5 ] , we have @xmath200 where we have only used the partial fraction decompositions .",
    "hence this holds for @xmath201 with @xmath197 .",
    "it is known ( see @xcite ) that all functions on the both sides of and can be meromorphically continued to the whole complex space . hence and",
    "hold for all @xmath202 except for the singularities .    on the other hand , by considering the harmonic product ,",
    "we obtain @xmath203 and also @xmath204 we know that and hold for not only integer points but also complex points , from the original meaning of the harmonic product and the meromorphic continuation of multiple zeta - functions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "combining - , we obtain the following functional relations which really include double shuffle relations .",
    "this implies that the following formulas are answers to the problem proposed by the second - named author ( see section [ sec-1 ] ) .",
    "[ t-5 - 1 ] for @xmath205 with @xmath206 , @xmath207 and @xmath208 hold for all @xmath209 except for the singularities .",

    "then @xmath211 from , we obtain @xmath212 therefore , when @xmath213 , we can see that gives the following double shuffle relation for mzvs : @xmath214 in particular when @xmath215 , we have @xmath216    similarly , combining , and the harmonic product formulas , we can produce functional relations for zeta - functions of the root system of @xmath56 type for any @xmath6 , including double shuffle relations .",
    "in the previous sections we understood that each step of spp is given by . however , the step itself is actually obtained by applying repeatedly the fundamental shuffle product relation : @xmath217 for @xmath218 and @xmath45 .",
    "now we will confirm that even this refined each step of procedures of shuffle products can be realized as the corresponding step of partial fraction decompositions of zeta values of root systems .",
    "for this confirmation , we consider for @xmath219 , which implies the case @xmath220 , that is , @xmath221        using and , and noting @xmath226 , we obtain @xmath227 on the right - hand side , we rewrite @xmath123 to @xmath185 in the first part , and to @xmath186 in the second part .",
