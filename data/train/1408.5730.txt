    "we emphasize @xmath91 and @xmath92 are not independent and will discuss its physical results soon .",
    "we make some observations about the contribution of a single dirac point : there is a constraint of @xmath93 fields which is a direct result of the equation of motion .",
    "the physical reason of the constraint is that the charge density only couples to the transverse component of spin density @xcite .",
    "the effective action around a single dirac point becomes a maxwell - chern - simons theory after a dual transformation @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors eliminate the dirac point with a larger mass . however , up to the lowest order , the contribution of a dirac point only dependents on the sign of its mass ( see eq .",
    "( [ leff ] ) ) , thus there is no way to get rid of the effect of the heavier dirac fermion , as emphasized by haldane @xcite .",
    "notice that @xmath91 and @xmath92 have the same magnitude but the sign may be the same or opposite .",
    "this leads to two remarkable results : ( i ) the rotational symmetry is broken by the quantum anomaly in the one loop approximation .",
    "this means that the underline lattice @xmath0 symmetry is also broken if the high order expansions are considered .",
    "( ii ) the effective theory is no longer a gauge theory because of the cancellation of some of the components of the @xmath91 field .",
    "however , this also means that the @xmath91 field can not be completely canceled even in the topological trivial case . in the following",
    "we study the dispersions of the collective modes @xmath91 in the topological trivial and nontrivial phases .    for @xmath94",
    ", i.e. , the trivial insulator case , the collective modes are dynamical in the lowest order approximation so we can omit the @xmath82 corrections .",

    "a strong enough interaction will induce a mott transition @xcite .",
    "however , on the one hand , the critical interaction of mott transition is of the order of band width @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the band gap can be tuned in cold atom systems .",
    "we thus expect that the in - gap modes can be observed experimentally .    for @xmath102 ,",
    "i.e. , the chern insulator case , to get the dispersion of the collective modes one have to consider the @xmath82 corrections .",
    "we then find two dispersions around the dirac points @xmath103 with @xmath104 , and @xmath105 are dependent on @xmath106 and are of order 1 .",
    "these modes can also lie in the band gap .",
    "let the band gap be @xmath107 and @xmath108 , the in - gap condition is @xmath109 . comparing this condition with the one in topological trivial case",
    ", we find that for the same @xmath110 and @xmath100 , the band gap @xmath107 should be larger than @xmath111 to get the in - gap modes . generally speaking",
    ", this means that the gap of the in - gap collective modes in a chern insulator is larger than that in a trivial insulator . since we are considering the large band gap limit , @xmath112 , the dispersion eq .",
    "( [ sec ] ) is one - dimensional like and can be approximated as @xmath113 this mode is the characteristic mode in the chern insulator phase : it s one - dimensional like with large velocity .",
    "now we get the main results of this paper : we find that in an insulator with dirac points , the lattice point group symmetry may be broken by the quantum anomaly and there are one - dimensional like collective modes .",
    "these bulk modes also reveal the topology of the insulator : in the large band gap limit , the gap of collective modes of a chern insulator is larger than that of a trivial insulator and both modes can lie in the band gap .",
    "what is more , the dispersion of the collective modes in a chern insulator is along a given direction , say , connecting the two dirac points while in a trivial insulator it is perpendicular to that direction .",
    "we are not aware of collective modes with these properties .",
    "our predictions can be examined in cold atom experiments .",
    "the collective modes can by measured through bragg scattering . in the bragg scattering process , two laser beams with 3-momentum difference @xmath114 are sent to the trapped cold atom gases on the optical lattice .",
    "the illuminated cold atom system responds to this perturbation with a density fluctuation @xmath115 .",
    "the atoms then absorb a momentum after the bragg scattering .",

    "<S> we study a haldane model with nearest neighbor interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we find one - dimensional like collective modes arising due to the interplay of pseudo - spin and valley degrees of freedom . in the large band gap or moderate interaction limit , these excitations are low energy modes lying in the band gap . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion relations are qualitatively different in trivial insulator phase and chern insulator phase , thus can be used to identify the topology of the haldane model with the bulk property . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss how to detect these modes in cold atom systems . </S>",
    "<S> an abelian gauge theory will emerge when a physical current - current interaction is introduced to the haldane model or the kane - mele model . </S>"
