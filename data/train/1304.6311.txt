    "it also exhibits chaotic dynamics under appropriate parametric conditions .",
    "hence , conventional fourier based approach is inadequate to compute the local dynamics .",
    "we make use of both continuous and discrete wavelets to characterize the periodic , as well as self similar behavior of this system .",
    "the periodic components are ascertained by isolating the variations in both temporal and frequency domains .",
    "morlet wavelet , a product of a variable gaussian window and a sinusoidal function , is used to identify local periodic modulations .",
    "wavelet transform splits the input time series into components that depend on both position and scale.@xmath11 one then characterizes the variations in it , by changing the scale for a particular location .",
    "the study of power in the scale dependent variations is carried out to reveal presence of turbulence and dissipation in the system.@xmath12 the multi - fractal scaling properties has also been estimated precisely through wavelet based detrended fluctuation analysis.@xmath13    the paper is organized as follows . in the ensuing section",

    "[ fig : filt ] shows a typical potential time series .",
    "the ` denoised ' version , for highlighting the periodic motion of the raw signal , is shown for comparison .",
    "for each input voltage @xmath17 , the frequency input @xmath18 is varied from 25 hz to 100 hz , in a step size of 15 hz in order to estimate the frequency response of this system .",
    "this process was repeated for 10 v , 20 v , 30 v and 40 v input voltages .",
    "the potential fluctuations of the piezoelectric crystal @xmath19 , due to the bouncing of the ball on top of it , is the time series to be analyzed in the following sections .    as will be seen in the following sections , the bouncing ball shows periodic behavior for smaller values of the forcing parameters .",
    "it also exhibits short - time periodic behavior and time varying transient dynamics for higher values of the potential , the unstable alteration of phases of apparently periodic time series highlights presence of intermittency.@xmath20 as the forcing frequency increases with constant forcing voltage , the ball reveals non - linear behavior.@xmath9 we now proceed for a quantitative study of this complex dynamics .",
    "we start with the estimation of the lyapunov exponent @xmath21 . as is evident from figs .",
    "[ fig : lya ] and [ fig : lyu ] , for low values of the forcing parameters , the exponent is negative .",
    "negative lyapunov exponents are characteristic of dissipative systems , which exhibit asymptotic stability .",
    "hence , for negative @xmath22 , the orbit is attracted to a stable fixed point ; the more negative the exponent , the greater being the stability . for higher values of the forcing parameters , @xmath23 is obtained , where the system shows chaotic dynamics.@xmath24    figures [ fig : lya ] and [ fig : lyu ] depict the lyapunov exponents , obtained by varying both the forcing parameters .",
    "we note that , even for low potential input , at higher frequencies the system s @xmath22 is positive .",
    "it is observed that , for high values of forcing potential , with low values of forcing frequency , the system can show chaotic behavior ; whereas with high values of forcing frequency , the system exhibits periodic nature , though it is forced with high values of potential , except at 10 v forcing potential , which exhibits contrasting non - linear behavior . in the following ,",
    "we explore in more detail , the dynamics of this potential time series , using fourier method and wavelet based approach .",
    "fourier transform is a well known method , which decomposes a signal to complex exponential functions of different frequencies :    @xmath25    with the inverse transform , @xmath26 here @xmath18 and @xmath27 are frequency and time variables .",
    "figure [ fig : fou ] shows a typical fourier power spectrum , showing the dominant low - frequency periodic components after denoising .",
    "as expected , the signals contain a noise component , which can be reduced through denoising to highlight the periodic behavior .",
    "the noise strength was found to increase with increasing magnitude of the forcing parameters .",
    "we have applied a wavelet based filter on the signal to remove high frequency transients to clearly highlight the periodic behavior in the phase - space.@xmath5 figure [ fig : phase ] depicts the phase - space plot of the filtered signal , explicating the periodic dynamics .",
    "the number of converging loops show the multi - periodic nature of the dynamics . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] , the random phase change of the periodic orbits , indicates the intermittency behavior of the system .",
    "we now study the output from the system in order to identify the parameter domain , corresponding to non - linear behavior .",
    "figures [ fig : ofr ] and [ fig : ovol ] represent the response of the system to varying forcing parameters . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ofr ] , except for the input parameter of 10 v , the highest response frequencies are same as the respective forcing frequencies , indicating linear behavior . for @xmath28",
    ", the highest response frequency output is found to be 75 hz and 50 hz , for 25 hz and 100 hz inputs respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ovol ] , for higher values of forcing parameters , non - linear behavior is observed from the frequency response .",
    "the frequency response gets diminished in the system and can also get amplified for smaller values of forcing parameters.@xmath9 this behavior , arising due to turbulence , is studied in detail in sec.ii(c ) .",
    "we now analyze the self - similar behavior of the time series , for identifying possible presence of fractal structure . for this purpose , the cumulative sum of the mean subtracted fluctuations",
    "is computed as shown in fig .",

    "they are characterized by their fractal dimension * d*,@xmath40 a non - integer number that quantifies the density of fractals .",
    "the number * d * measures the degree of fractal boundary fragmentation i.e. , irregularity over multiple scales :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 .    in this bouncing ball system , the value of @xmath43 varies in between 1 - 2 , depending upon the forcing potentials , as well as frequencies .",
    "as is evident , the mono - fractal behavior is not accurate ; hence , we now make use of wavelet transformation for a better understanding of the local dynamics and mulit - fractal character .      wavelet transform has both discrete and continuous nature .",
    "discrete wavelet transform employs a series of different wavelet functions , composed of a scaling function , mother and daughter wavelets , which has a strictly finite extent.@xmath44 the continuous wavelets are localized and they are not of strictly finite length .    a convolution product of the data sequence @xmath19 with",
    "the scaled and translated version of the scaling wavelet functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively , is known as wavelet transform .",
    "two parameters are used to perform scaling and translation ; the scale parameter @xmath47 stretches ( or compresses ) the wavelet to the required resolution , while the translation parameter @xmath48 shifts the wavelet to the desired location:@xmath49    @xmath50    where @xmath47 , @xmath48 are real and @xmath51 .",
    "the wavelet transform acts as a mathematical microscope , with variable position and magnification , uncovering finer details of the signal , while operating at smaller scales.@xmath11      for identifying multi - fractality of fractal time series , one needs to remove the local trends .",
    "we have used discrete wavelets belonging to the daubechies family to locate local polynomial trends from the profile .",
    "considering @xmath52 to be the time series of data length @xmath53 , the ` profile ' @xmath54 is the cumulative sum of series after subtracting the mean :    @xmath55,\\ ; i=1,2,3, ....... n\\ ] ]    wavelet transform on the profile @xmath54 has been implemented to separate the fluctuations from the trend .",
    "the fluctuation extraction have involved a wavelet decomposition using the db4 wavelet , to remove linear trends .",
    "for db4 , in addition to the defining relation @xmath56 ; the wavelets satisfy the vanishing moment condition @xmath57 .",
    "this implies that for a linear signal of the type , @xmath58 , the wavelet coefficients are identically zero .",
    "therefore , this linear trend will be captured by the scaling function.@xmath59    the profile series can be decomposed for the db4 as    @xmath60    where , @xmath61 is the wavelet function of @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the father wavelet .",
    "the coefficients @xmath64 , @xmath65 are known as the low and high pass coefficients .",
    "the profile is reconstructed at a particular level @xmath66 , by taking only the low pass coefficients to extract the trend at level @xmath66 .",
    "this trend is subtracted from the profile to obtain the fluctuations at that scale . due to the convolution errors",
    ", the obtained fluctuations can have edge artifacts , which are removed by performing this fluctuation extraction on the reversed profile and taking the average .",
    "after that , we subdivide the fluctuations in to @xmath67 non - overlapping segments , such that @xmath68 $ ] , where the segment length @xmath47 is related to the wavelet scale @xmath66 by the number of filter coefficients used in the wavelet . the @xmath69 order fluctuation function ,",

    "[ fig : ofr ] and [ fig : ovol ] , we have already seen this contrasting feature of the system , and will explore the details of this behavior using heisenberg and kolmogorov fits.@xmath82 the hurst exponent first increases and then decreases for higher forcing frequencies .",
