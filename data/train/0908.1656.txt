    "the introduction of these nonadiabatic localized states allows a realistic description of an atomic - like motion of the electrons . while in the framework of the adiabatic approximation the electrons move in _ rigid _ orbitals in the _ average _ potential of the other electrons , in the nonadiabatic system a localized electron moves in a potential depending on which of the adjacent localized states is occupied and on the present motion of the electrons in these states .",
    "such a correlated electronic motion within a fluctuating potential leads to localized orbitals which are not symmetric at any moment , but only on the average of time . as a consequence ,",
    "the centers of mass of the localized states become permanently accelerated in varying directions .",
    "the resulting nonadiabatic motions of the centers of mass are labeled by the new quantum number @xmath16 .",
    "the nhm assumes that there exist nonadiabatic localized states satisfying the equation @xmath18 for @xmath19 if the considered partly filled band is one of the narrowest bands of the given material , where @xmath20 means @xmath21 and @xmath22 or @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "( [ eq:11 ] ) follows from the first postulate of the nhm which assumes that the correlation effects specified by eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) are energetically unfavorable in narrow , partly filled bands .",

    "a correlated electron system characterized by eq .  ( [ eq:11 ] ) possesses three novel features distinguishing it from any system described within the adiabatic approximation .",
    "first , within the nhm there exists a `` nonadiabatic condensation energy '' @xmath25 ; second , the nonadiabatic hamiltonian @xmath26 possesses unusual commutation properties ; and thirdly , the `` crystal spin '' of the nonadiabatic localized states is a conserved quantity .",

    "( [ eq:11 ] ) is lower than the correlation energy of this state within the adiabatic approximation .",
    "hence , the electrons of the narrowest , partly filled bands of the metals lower their energy by the `` nonadiabatic condensation energy '' @xmath27 at the transition from the adiabatic ( more bandlike ) to the nonadiabatic atomic - like state .",

    "( [ eq:11 ] ) , the nonadiabatic hamiltonian @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) commutes with all the symmetry operators of @xmath31 , _ but not _ with the symmetry operators of @xmath30 that do not belong to @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the group - theoretical nhm allows a straightforward physical interpretation of the symmetry of the localized states related to the atomic - like motion in narrow , partly filled bands .",
    "this feature distinguishes @xmath26 from any hamiltonian @xmath32 written in the adiabatic approximation since the symmetry properties of @xmath32 are independent of the symmetry of the wannier basis used to calculate its matrix elements .",
    "the nonadiabatic localized states are no longer labeled by the spin quantum number @xmath33 , but by a new quantum number @xmath34 which may be called the quantum number of the `` crystal spin '' .",
    "this is in analogy to the wave vector @xmath35 of the bloch functions which is sometimes referred to as `` crystal momentum '' in order to distinguish it from a true momentum .    within the nonadiabatic correlated system the conservation law of spin angular momentum as expressed by the equation @xmath36 = 0 \\quad\\mbox{for } \\alpha \\in o(3)\\ ] ]",

    "a bloch state bears the crystal - spin angular momentum @xmath42 and suitable linear combinations of the phonons carry the crystal spin @xmath43 .",
    "localized functions @xmath44 representing the nonadiabatic localized states are highly complicated since they depend on an additional coordinate @xmath45 related to the nonadiabatic motion of the center of mass ( while @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote , as usual , the local and spin coordinate , respectively , of the localized electron ) .",
    "fortunately , these functions need not to be known .",
    "the nhm only postulates their existence and assumes that they have the same symmetry and spin dependence as the best localized exact wannier functions of the considered partly filled energy band . in this context , `` exact wannier functions '' form a _",
    "complete _ basis of the bloch functions of this band .",
    "in several narrow , partly filled energy bands of the metals the electrons can gain the nonadiabatic condensation energy @xmath25 only under specific conditions : in a narrow , partly filled `` magnetic band ''  @xcite related to a magnetic structure @xmath48 the electrons can occupy the atomic - like state _ only if _ this magnetic structure @xmath48 actually exists in the considered material .",
    "further , electrons in a narrow , partly filled `` superconducting band '' ( as defined in sec .  [",
    "sec : defsbands ] ) occupying the atomic - like state are forced in a new way to form cooper pairs below a certain transition temperature .",
    "this `` new way '' will be substantiated in sec .",
    "[ sec : cooper ] .",
    "this result suggests that the nonadiabatic condensation energy @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) stabilizes both magnetism  @xcite and superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "both phenomena have the same physical origin : they exist because the electrons at the fermi level tend to occupy the energetically favorable atomic - like state .",
    "the special symmetry and spin dependence of the related wannier function determine whether the material becomes magnetic or superconducting ( or has a property not yet considered ) .",
    "this important statement of the nhm is corroborated by the calculated band structures mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] .",
    "usually , the energy bands crossing the fermi level in the paramagnetic metals are degenerate at several points and lines of symmetry of the brillouin zone . therefore , it is not possible to separate narrow isolated sets of bands whose bloch functions can be unitarily transformed into best localized wannier functions that are symmetry - adapted to the full space group @xmath30 of the considered metal .",
    "however , in some cases such wannier functions may be constructed if we allow that they are adapted only to the symmetry of a magnetic subgroup @xmath31 of @xmath30 or if they are allowed to be spin dependent  @xcite . in the first case , the band is a magnetic band as mentioned in the foregoing sec .  [",
    "sec : smbands ] , in the second case it is a superconducting band .",
    "we define an energy band of a given material to be a `` superconducting band '' if the bloch functions of this band can be unitarily transformed into _ spin - dependent _ wannier functions @xmath49 ( as defined by eq .",

    "in a narrow , roughly half - filled superconducting band , the electron system has no other possibility to gain the nonadiabatic condensation energy @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) but to occupy an atomic - like state represented by _ spin - dependent _ wannier functions .",
    "this spin dependence has far reaching consequences because only special atomic - like motions with spin - dependent localized states may exist in the nonadiabatic system .",
    "these states are determined by the interplay of two conservation laws : on the one hand , the bare electrons satisfy the conservation of the electron spin and , on the other hand , the nonadiabatic localized states conserve the crystal spin .    in this section , the atomic - like motion with spin - dependent localized states is shortly characterized , a detailed substantiation of all the statements is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .      when the localized states are represented by spin - dependent wannier functions , the nonadiabatic operator @xmath17 of coulomb interaction complying with eq .",

    "however , the nonadiabatic motion of the centers of mass in the localized states gives point to another interpretation .",

    "thus , eq .  ( [ eq:28 ] ) indicates that this special nonadiabatic motion occurs in such a way that phonons or other boson excitation are excited ( or absorbed ) which store the surplus crystal spin angular momenta .",
    "this interpretation is corroborated by the fact that by the mere addition of symmetrized boson operators we may construct from @xmath17 an interaction @xmath53 which conserves the crystal spin , @xmath54 = 0\\quad\\mbox{for } \\alpha \\in g_m.\\ ] ] the boson operator @xmath55 creates a localized boson @xmath56 with crystal spin @xmath57 at the position @xmath58 .",
    "this `` spin - boson interaction '' @xmath59 replaces the coulomb interaction @xmath60 in a narrow superconducting band . in cubic crystals",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath59 are determined by eq .",
    "( 4.28 ) of ref .",
    "the complete nonadiabatic hamiltonian @xmath26 now may be written as @xmath61 with @xmath62 denoting the operator of the boson energy .      since @xmath59 depends on boson operators ,",
    "a certain number of crystal - spin-1 bosons is excited in the ground state of the nonadiabatic hamiltonian @xmath26 at any temperature . however , at zero temperature we may assume that these bosons are virtually excited , i.e. , each boson pair is reabsorbed immediately after its generation , producing in this way an effective _ electron - electron _ interaction .",
    "thus , at zero temperature we approximate the nonadiabatic system represented by @xmath26 by a purely electronic system represented by a hamiltonian @xmath63 not depending on boson operators .    also at zero temperature , the nonadiabatic mechanism specified by eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) occurs in the nonadiabatic system . in the purely electronic system represented by @xmath64 ,",
    "however , the electronic motion is no longer coupled to the motion of the centers of mass of the localized states , but the interaction term @xmath65 of @xmath64 contains the effective electron - electron interaction which is produced by this nonadiabatic mechanism .",

    "it is not possible to solve the schrdinger equation for the electron - boson system in a solid state .",
    "hence , it can not be excluded that there exists a condition for superconducting _ eigenstates _ not yet considered in the theory of superconductivity .    from the conditions  ( [ eq:20 ] ) and  ( [ eq:21 ] ) it follows that the interaction term of the electronic hamiltonian @xmath64 in eq .",

    "( [ eq:25 ] ) may be interpreted as _ condition of constraint _ indicating the existence of _ constraining forces _ in a narrow superconducting band .",

    "( [ eq:25 ] ) demonstrates that @xmath26 is acting in a special part of the hilbert space representing a nonadiabatic system in which constraining forces are effective in a way familiar from classical mechanics . below a transition temperature , these constraining forces reduce the degrees of freedom of the electron system by forcing the electrons to form pairs that are invariant under time inversion , i.e. , by forcing the electrons to form cooper pairs possessing only half the degrees of freedom of unpaired electrons .    in materials that do not possess a superconducting band , on the other hand , constraining forces halving the degrees of freedom of the electrons",
    "do not exist . in the classical mechanics , however , any reduction of the degrees of freedom of any system of particles",
    "is caused by constraining forces .",
    "hence , it can not be excluded that also in quantum mechanical systems any reduction of the electronic degrees of freedom is produced by constraining forces since quantum particles behave in some respects similar to classical particles .",
    "this comparison of the quantum system with a classical system suggests that the constraining forces characterized by eq .",
    "( [ eq:25 ] ) _ are required _ for the formation of cooper pairs , i.e. , they are required for the hamiltonian to possess superconducting eigenstates .",
    "this interpretation is corroborated by the observation that materials not possessing a narrow , partly filled superconducting band do not become superconducting .",
    "thus , the author proposes that materials which do not possess a narrow , partly filled superconducting band , do not become superconducting even if the electrons of the considered material are ( weakly or strongly ) coupled by an effective electron - electron interaction .",
    "it should be noted that the purely electronic system represented by the hamiltonian @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:15 ] ) only approximates the true nonadiabatic system represented by the operator @xmath26 given in eq .",

    "so , the cooper pairs are not really _ rigid _ as suggested by the ground state @xmath70 of @xmath64 . in the nonadiabatic system the physics of the mechanism of constraining forces may be demonstrated more realistically in terms of `` spring - mounted '' cooper pairs  @xcite .      in accordance with the generally accepted and experimentally corroborated concept of superconductivity , the formation of cooper pairs",
    "is mediated by boson excitations also within a superconducting band .",
    "further , the constraining forces determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq:25 ] ) do not alter the energy of the electron system but only lower the degrees of freedom of the electrons .",
    "consequently , the vast majority of the statements and calculations of the traditional theory of superconductivity _ should stay valid _ in a superconducting band .",

    "( [ eq:11 ] ) , on the other hand , is produced by the coulomb _ correlation _ energy of the electrons _ near the fermi level _ , in accordance with the generally accepted concept that correlated conduction electrons are responsible for superconductivity .",
    "further , in accordance with the general belief , also in superconducting bands the formation of cooper pairs is mediated by boson excitations . in superconducting bands , however , the pair formation is mediated by the _ energetically lowest _ boson excitations of the crystal that possess the crystal - spin angular momentum @xmath1 and are sufficiently stable to transport it through the crystal .",
    "these `` crystal - spin-1 '' bosons are localized excitations @xmath264 ( with @xmath57 labeling the three directions of the crystal spin and @xmath58 denoting a lattice point ) of well - defined symmetry  @xcite which propagate as bloch waves ( with the crystal momentum @xmath265 ) through the crystal .",
    "the @xmath264 are generated during spin - flip processes in the superconducting band and must carry off the surplus crystal - spin angular - momenta generated at these processes .",
    "this spin - boson mechanism suggests that the @xmath264 are coupled phonon - plasmon modes : in a first step the atomic - like electrons in the superconducting band transmit their angular momenta to the core electrons by generating a plasmon - like vibration of the core electrons against the atoms . in a second step ,",
    "these plasmon - like excitations generate phonon - like vibrations of lower energy if crystal - spin-1 phonons are sufficiently stable in the considered material .",
    "thus , the author proposes that the @xmath264 are coupled phonon - plasmon modes which have dominant phonon character in the isotropic lattices of the transition elements and , hence , confirm the electron - phonon mechanism that enters the bcs theory  @xcite in these materials  @xcite",
    ". however , phonon - like excitations are not able to transport crystal - spin angular - momenta within the two - dimensional copper - oxygen layers of the cuprates , see ref .",
    "@xcite for preliminary ideas to this problem . within two - dimensional layers ,",
    "the @xmath264 necessarily are energetically higher lying excitations of dominant plasmon character .",
    "this clear dependence of stable crystal - spin-1 bosons on the properties of the lattice suggests that they are ( at least partially ) responsible for the special properties of the layered superconductors , i.e. , their strong - coupling features and their high transition temperatures .",
    "also mgb@xmath0 contains two - dimensional hexagonal nets of b atoms .",
    "thus , also in this layered material crystal - spin-1 _ phonons _ will be less stable than in the isotropic lattices of the transition elements .",
    "the balance between the phonon and plasmon character of stable crystal - spin-1 excitations is shifted towards the plasmon character leading to a higher transition temperature and to the experimentally established  @xcite reduced isotope effect .    the superconducting band in mgb@xmath0 is composed of @xmath266- and @xmath267-bands in accordance with the two - band model of superconductivity  @xcite in this material characterized by @xmath266- and @xmath267-bands associated with different parts of the fermi surface  @xcite .",
