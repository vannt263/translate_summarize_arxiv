    "despite their structural simplicity ( exemplified in figure  [ fig : xto : structure ] ) perovskite compounds of the form @xmath4 show a wide variety of physical properties , particularly when the simple cubic structure is distorted  @xcite . changing the ionic radius of the ion on the @xmath5 site allows the distortion to be controlled and , through this , the physics of these materials can be tuned  @xcite .",
    "an example of two similar compounds where a small change in the ionic radius causes a significant change in the physical properties is the pair @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",

    "both precession frequencies shown in figure  [ fig : xto : ltoresults](a ) are well defined up to @xmath13 , although it was not possible to resolve a precession signal in the @xmath58  k dataset even though the fast relaxing component was still evident at this temperature , whereas @xmath59 for @xmath60  k took the simple exponential form expected for a fast - fluctuating paramagnetic phase .",
    "the values of @xmath52 were fitted to equation  [ eq : xto : nuoft ] with @xmath61 , leading to the parameters @xmath62  mhz , @xmath63 , and @xmath64  k. this value of @xmath13 is consistent with the value found by zhou and goodenough  @xcite , and it is conceivable that other magnetic studies may have been strongly affected by small regions with slightly different oxygen stoichiometry , giving the appearance of a slightly higher @xmath13 .",

    "the values of @xmath52 and @xmath54 determined independently in the analysis of the asymmetry data were found to be proportional to one another , in agreement with the model of muon sites with very large local fields suggested above , so both were fitted to equation  [ eq : xto : nuoft ] in parallel , fixing @xmath61 , leading to the parameters @xmath69  mhz , @xmath70  mhz , @xmath71 , and @xmath72  k. the linewidth of the oscillating components is @xmath73  mhz at low temperature , falling slightly towards the transition .",
    "the magnetic structures of @xmath6 and @xmath7 have previously been determined using neutron scattering  @xcite , although there remained some uncertainty over the orientation of the magnetic moments in @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "these magnetic structures can be compared with the @xmath0sr data by calculating the dipolar fields : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the position of the muon , @xmath76 is the ordered magnetic moment of the @xmath77th @xmath9 ion and @xmath78 is the unit vector from the @xmath9 ion at site @xmath79 to the muon for points within the unit cell .",
    "contributions from of order @xmath80 unit cells were considered .",
    "of course , this method neglects the hyperfine contact field , the lorentz field and the demagnetizing field , although the latter two are zero for antiferromagnets and the contribution of the former to the magnetic field experienced at muon stopping sites , @xmath81   from @xmath82 ions , is generally small .",
    "the details specific to each compound will be discussed in sections  [ subsec : dipolelto ]  and  [ subsec : dipoleyto ] below .",
    "such dipole field calculations have been compared to @xmath0sr data in other perovskite compounds .",
    "some of the more thoroughly studied materials have been the rare earth orthoferrites , @xmath83 .",
    "the @xmath84 , and @xmath85 variants were studied by holzschuh _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and they found that the stable muon site common to all of these compounds was on the mirror plane at @xmath86 , this being the rare earth  oxygen layer , either about @xmath87 or @xmath88    from the nearest oxygen ion , as would be expected for the @xmath89 analog , @xmath90",
    ". this study was followed by others taking a slightly different approach to finding the muon sites  @xcite , and these found further plausible sites , albeit apparently metastable ones , neighbouring the rare earth  oxygen layers .",
    "results of these studies have also been applied to orthorhombic nickelates , without precession frequencies to test the hypothesis , but the approach was consistent with phase separation occurring within magnetically inequivalent layers  @xcite .",
    "the most immediately relevant example within the literature is @xmath91  @xcite , for which a detailed study showed that the two observed precession frequencies corresponded to two structurally inequivalent muon sites , the lower frequency one within the rare earth  oxygen mirror plane and the higher frequency",
    "one at an interstitial site within the @xmath92@xmath11 plane .",
    "the latter site requires a significant contribution from the contact fields due to the neighbouring oxygen ions , which the dipole field calculations presented here do not consider .",
    "dipole field calculations were carried out for the @xmath93-type magnetic structure reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and shown in figure  [ fig : xto : structure](a ) , assuming the magnetic moments ( @xmath94 ) are aligned along the @xmath12-axis  @xcite .",
    "calculations were also carried out assuming alignment along the @xmath16-axis as this possibility had previously been favoured and neutron measurements did not clearly exclude it  @xcite .",
    "the results are periodic in the @xmath16-axis by half the orthorhombic @xmath16-axis lattice constant .",
    "we would expect the muon sites to lie within the @xmath95 plane , as they do in @xmath91  @xcite .",
    "if the moments are along the @xmath16-axis , the only contours corresponding to both observed precession frequencies are very closely spaced at points around @xmath96    from the oxygen ion centres within the plane . for moments aligned along the @xmath12-axis",
    "the calculations give results much more similar to those in @xmath91 .",
    "since we expect the @xmath11@xmath0 bond to be around @xmath87   , this moment orientation seems far more consistent with the observed precession frequencies .",
    "the other possibility is that the muon sites lie within the @xmath9@xmath11 layer .",
    "this is far more consistent with moment alignment along the @xmath16-axis , since suitable field values are found at sites between oxygen ions .",
    "it is more difficult to make precise assignment of muon sites in this case because the field contours are far more closely spaced . while there remains some ambiguity ,",
    "observing well separated field contours corresponding to previously identified muon sites for similar materials , and apparently equally numbers of plausible muon sites for each frequency , in agreement with the experimental amplitudes , is strong evidence that the moments are aligned along @xmath12 rather than @xmath16 , something neutron results have not been able to demonstrate with more certainty  @xcite .",
    "dipole field calculations were carried out for the ferromagnetic structure reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , with moment values of ( @xmath97 along the principal axes of the pseudocubic unit cell ( @xmath98 ) , and depicted in figure  [ fig : xto : structure](b ) .",
    "the calculations show that the magnetic fields for this largely ferromagnetic structure are much greater than those in the antiferromagnetic structure of @xmath6 . as in @xmath6",
    "the lower frequency component in the signal is consistent with sites within the @xmath5@xmath11 plane ( @xmath99 ) , but there are no sites within this layer that would correspond to the higher frequency observed .",
    "the higher frequency component appears consistent with a smaller number of sites between oxygen ions near to or in the @xmath100 layer , but rather closer to the @xmath1 ion positions .",
    "there are also plausible sites corresponding to the lower frequency within this layer .",
    "because of the small magnetic moments along the @xmath12 and @xmath18-axes the contours are more distorted than those calculated for @xmath6 . considering the variation of these distortions along the @xmath16-axis leads to a structure not dissimilar to a helically ordered magnet , for these small components .",
    "this could also lead to structurally equivalent sites with much higher local fields but significant magnetic inequivalencies , leading to the fast - relaxing component , @xmath39 , of the observed asymmetry .",
    "the @xmath0sr results clearly demonstrate intrinsic magnetic order below the expected ordering temperatures in both samples .",
    "we are also able to follow the temperature dependence of the ( sub)lattice magnetization and show that the behaviour is essentially conventional .",
    "the values of @xmath50 derived from equation  [ eq : xto : nuoft ] describe the behaviour close to the transition temperature .",
    "the values of @xmath101 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath102 ( @xmath7 ) are significantly below the mean field expectation of @xmath103 and lie within the range @xmath104-@xmath105 consistent with 3d critical fluctuations ( e.g.  @xmath106 ( 3d  @xmath107 ) or @xmath108 ( 3d heisenberg ) )  @xcite .",
    "this is reasonable in the context of the relatively isotropic nature of the exchange interactions in these compounds .    in the context of the dipole field calculations described in section  [ sec : xto : dipole ] and the previous literature ,",
    "the sites obtained for the two compounds considered here seem entirely plausible . for both compounds",
    "we find a site corresponding to the lower precession frequency in the @xmath5@xmath11 layer , as in @xmath91 , but the origin of the higher frequency component is almost certainly different in the two cases . in @xmath6",
    "the higher frequency sites also appear to be in the rare earth  oxygen layer , and",
    "this fits with the equal amplitudes of the two components observed in the @xmath0sr signal .",
    "sites near the @xmath9@xmath11 planes seem unlikely on the basis of the calculations . in @xmath7",
    "the higher frequency component can not be in the @xmath109@xmath11 plane if the hyperfine coupling is negligible .",
    "a more plausible assignment corresponds to sites lying between two oxygen ions and relatively close to the @xmath9 ions , which would explain the high precession frequency , the relatively small amplitude ( since the site would probably be less electrostatically favourable ) , and also the large initial phase offset , consistent with a stronger coupling to the antiferromagnetically coupled moments in the @xmath110-plane .",
    "lower frequency sites could also occur in the @xmath9@xmath11 layers . in both compounds",
    "a full site determination would require measurements on single crystals and in applied fields , as was done for the rare earth orthoferrites  @xcite and @xmath91  @xcite .",
    "in magnetically ordered polycrystalline samples we would expect the relaxing component to account for around one third of the relaxing asymmetry , owing to the polycrystalline averaging of the effects of the magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the muon spin direction .",
    "the situation in these materials is not this straightforward .",
    "the fast initial relaxation @xmath54 is most likely to originate from large magnetic fields at muon stopping sites which are slightly magnetically inequivalent .",
    "the dipole field calculations suggest that both compounds have plausible stopping sites close to the magnetic moment directions of nearby @xmath1 ions , where a small range of muon stopping positions would give sufficiently different magnetic fields to lead to this fast relaxing component . because of this rapid depolarization we are unable to distinguish the relaxation due to fields parallel to the muon spin direction and the amplitude @xmath39 is likely to include the longitudinal relaxing component usually observed in polycrystalline magnets as well as the contribution from muons stopping at sites with very high local fields .",
    "the results presented in this paper are in excellent agreement with previous reports of the magnetic properties of both @xmath6 and @xmath7 obtained using neutron diffraction  @xcite .",
    "this confirmation is worthwhile given the history of sample dependent results and the difficulty of controlling the oxidation state precisely  @xcite .",
    "comparison between the precession frequencies observed in @xmath6 and dipole field calculations strongly favours moment alignment along the @xmath12-axis rather than the @xmath16-axis , an issue powder neutron diffraction has difficulty resolving  @xcite .",
    "using a microscopic probe gives an independent means of testing the previous results from bulk probes ; our results confirm that despite the complexities of the underlying orbital physics , both compounds behave magnetically as bulk , three - dimensional magnets .",
    "we are also able to test the ability of dipole field calculations to reproduce the magnetic field distributions within oxide materials .",
    "this is successful for these compounds , where the similarity of both the structure and the muon sites nevertheless yields different internal fields due to the significantly different magnetic structures .",
