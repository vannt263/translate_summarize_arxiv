    "since the advent of radar systems much of the efforts have been devoted to increasing radar range resolution .",
    "the relationship between range resolution and signal bandwidth is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes range resolution , @xmath2 is the speed of light and @xmath3 is the bandwidth of the signal being used .",
    "hence , wideband radar systems can achieve higher resolution than their narrow - band counterparts . however , wideband signals correspond to short pulses that experience low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) at the receiver .",
    "further , they require high speed a / ds , and fast processors @xcite .",
    "step - frequency radar ( sfr ) achieves high range resolution without sharing the disadvantages of wideband systems .",
    "sfr transmits several narrowband pulses at different frequencies .",
    "the frequency remains constant during each pulse but increases in steps of @xmath4 between consecutive pulses .",
    "thus , while its instantaneous bandwidth is narrow , the sfr system has a large effective bandwidth .",
    "conventional step - frequency radars obtain one sample from each received pulse and then apply an inverse discrete fourier transform ( idft ) on the phase detector output sequence for detection . since the idft resolution increases with the number of transmitted pulses",
    ", sfr requires a large number of transmit pulses , or equivalently , large effective bandwidth .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a step - frequency radar with compressed sampling , that assuming the existence of a small number of targets exploits the sparseness of targets in the range - speed space .",
    "the application of compressive sampling to narrow - band radar systems was recently investigated in @xcite-@xcite . a cs - based data acquisition and imaging method",
    "was proposed in @xcite for stepped - frequency continuous - wave ground penetrating radars ( sfcw - gprs ) . in @xcite , cs - based step frequency",
    "was applied on through - the - wall radar imaging ( twri ) . in @xcite,@xcite",
    "the authors have assumed stationary targets and have shown that the the cs approach can provide a high - quality radar image using much fewer data samples than conventional methods . unlike @xcite,@xcite , the work in this paper explores joint target range and speed estimation based on compressive sampling , and proposes a radar system with reduced effective bandwidth as compared to traditional sfr systems .",
    "compressive sampling ( cs ) @xcite-@xcite has received considerable attention recently , and has been applied successfully in diverse fields , e.g. , image processing @xcite and wireless communications @xcite@xcite .",
    "the theory of cs states that a @xmath5-sparse signal @xmath6 of length @xmath7 can be recovered exactly with high probability from @xmath8 measurements via @xmath9-optimization .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the basis matrix that spans this sparse space , and let @xmath11 denote a measurement matrix .",
    "the convex optimization problem arising in cs is formulated as follows : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a sparse vector with @xmath5 principal elements and the remaining elements can be ignored ; @xmath11 is an @xmath14 matrix with @xmath15 , that is incoherent with @xmath10 .",
    "it has been shown that two properties govern the design of a stable measurement matrix : _ restricted isometry property _ and _ incoherence property _ @xcite .",
    "a @xmath5-sparse signal @xmath16 of length-@xmath7 can be recovered from @xmath17 samples provided @xmath18 and @xmath19 satisfies @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an arbitrary @xmath5-sparse signal and @xmath22 .",
    "this property is referred to as _ restricted isometry property _ ( rip ) .",
    "the _ incoherence _ property suggests that the rows @xmath23 of @xmath24 should be incoherent with the columns @xmath25 of @xmath10 .",
    "let us consider an sfr system that transmits @xmath26 pulses and waits for echoes of all pulses to return before it starts any processing .",
    "the frequency of @xmath27 pulse equals @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the starting frequency and @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath27 transmit pulse is of the form @xmath31 .",
    "the signal reflected by a target at distance @xmath32 moving with speed @xmath33 is @xmath34 where @xmath2 is the speed of light , @xmath35 is the pulse repetition interval ( pri ) .",
    "here we assume that @xmath33 is small enough to be considered constant within the pulse interval .    as we assume each pulse to be narrowband",
    ", we can ignore the delay of @xmath36 in the signal envelope , and just consider the phase shift for extracting the information on targets .",
    "therefore we have @xmath37    and the output of phase detector is of the form @xmath38 the exponent of ( [ phase ] ) can be written as @xmath39 the first term in ( [ phase_decomp ] ) represents a constant phase shift due to the starting frequency , while the second term represents the phase shift due to frequency offset of the @xmath40th pulse .",
    "the maximum unambiguous range and range resolution for step - frequency radar are given by @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "here @xmath43 is the total effective bandwidth of the signal over @xmath26 pulses .",
    "targets which are at distance @xmath44 will be seen by the system to be at distance @xmath45 .    the third term of ( [ phase_decomp ] )",
    "gives the doppler frequency shift experienced by the signal due to the target speed @xmath33 .",
    "the fourth term of ( [ phase_decomp ] ) represents the frequency spread due to target speed .",
    "this has the effect of spreading the energy of the main lobe at the target position .",
    "let us take the transmitter and receiver to be co - located and employ @xmath26 pulses for estimating the range and speed of targets .",
    "let us discretize the range space as @xmath46 $ ] , and the speed space as @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "the whole target scene can be described using @xmath48 grid points in the range - speed plane .",
    "the range and speed spaces discretization steps are @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the targets can be present only on the grid points . by representing the target scene as a matrix @xmath51 of size @xmath48 , equation ( [ phase ] ) becomes @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 represents zero - mean white noise .    putting the outputs of phase of the phase detector , i.e. , @xmath55 in vector @xmath56 , we get @xmath57 where @xmath58^t$ ] , @xmath59 represents white zero - mean measurement noise , and the elements of matrix @xmath60 equal @xmath61 for @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "we can think of the basis matrix @xmath64 as being a stack of column vectors @xmath65 , i.e. , @xmath66 where each @xmath67 is of size @xmath68 containing the phase detector outputs for all @xmath26 pulses corresponding to the phase shift due to a target located at the @xmath69 grid point .",
    "thus , @xmath70 accounts for the phase shift of all possible combinations of range and speed .",
    "taking the measurement matrix @xmath24 to be an @xmath71 identity matrix yields @xmath72 .",
    "based on ( [ y ] ) we can recover @xmath73 by applying the dantzig selector to the convex problem ( @xcite ) @xmath74 according to @xcite , the sparse vector @xmath75 can be recovered with very high probability if @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a positive scalar , @xmath78 is the maximum norm of columns in the sensing matrix @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the variance of the noise in ( [ matrixeqn ] ) . a lower bound is readily available , i.e. , @xmath81 .",
    "also , @xmath82 should not be too large because in that case the trivial solution @xmath83 is obtained .",
    "thus , we may set @xmath84 .",
    "in conventional sfr systems , the idft algorithm requires the columns of the transform matrix to be orthogonal .",
    "the range resolution in space depends on the frequency resolution in the fourier domain .",
    "therefore , these systems require @xmath85 pulses in order to have a range resolution of @xmath86 . for the proposed approach we can use @xmath87 pulses and still achieve a range resolution of @xmath86",
    ".    for moving targets , the conventional idft method for estimating range and speed observes a shift in the target positions ( due to speed ) and a spreading effect around the shifted position ( due to the fourth term in equation ( [ phase_decomp ] ) ) .",
    "these effects degrade the receiver performance causing erroneous range estimation and sometimes missing the target completely . in the proposed approach , since @xmath60 has columns corresponding to all the possible range - speed combinations , the estimated results are comparatively more accurate .",
    "* stationary targets - * our simulations use the following parameter values : @xmath88mhz , @xmath89khz , number of grid points @xmath90 .",
    "these values of @xmath4 give @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "we assume that the stationary point targets are present on the grid points .",
    "@xmath93 iterations of sparse target vectors are generated and the _ estimation accuracy _ is computed as the ratio of number of iterations for which the target ranges are correctly estimated to the total number of iterations .",
    "the basis matrix @xmath94 of size @xmath14 is generated according to equation ( [ matrix ] ) .",
    "the measurement matrix @xmath95 is an identity matrix @xmath96 of size @xmath97 .",
    "the optimization algorithm used to solve equation ( [ dantzig ] ) was obtained from @xcite .",
    "the number of pulses , @xmath26 , controls the column correlation of the measurement matrix for a given value of @xmath7 ( number of grid points ) . lowering the correlation between adjacent columns of @xmath98 increases the isolation among the columns , which results in better range estimation . for the measurement matrix generated by using equation ( [ matrix ] ) ,",
    "the adjacent column cross - correlation equals @xmath99    figure [ 100_5 ] shows the effect of changing the column correlation on the estimation accuracy of the cs sensing matrix when the unambiguous range is divided into @xmath93 grid points .",
    "figure [ acc_snr ] shows the accuracy of the cs detector in the presence of noise at different snr values for the case in which only @xmath100 targets are within the detectable range .",
    "the noise signal added at the received signal was gaussian zero - mean with variance @xmath101 , where the variance @xmath101 changes with snr .",
    "figure [ acc_comp ] compares the performance of the cs detector with the conventional idft detector for @xmath102 for a target scene containing @xmath100 stationary targets . as it can be seen , the cs detector performs better than the idft detector for all snrs .",
    "figures [ acc_snr ] and [ acc_comp ] show that we can use @xmath87 pulses to obtain @xmath103 , provided that @xmath104 .",
    "this proves that we can use lower bandwidths in cs compared to conventional techniques of idft and accurately estimate the target parameters , when the targets are sparsely present in the range - speed space .    *",
    "moving targets - * the number of grid points in the range domain is taken to be @xmath105 .",
    "@xmath106 grid points were used for discretizing the speed axis .",
    "the carrier frequency is @xmath107 and the step frequency @xmath108 .",
    "the ranges and speeds of @xmath109 targets are generated randomly in each of @xmath93 monte carlo runs . out of @xmath109 targets ,",
    "two targets are placed on adjacent grid points on the range - speed space in each run .",
    "the accuracy of the detector is computed as the ratio of the number of runs for which all target ranges and speeds have been estimate accurately to the total number of runs . in fig .",
    "[ n_100_different_snr ] , we show the detection accuracy of cs and idft methods for different values of snr . for moving targets , the idft method requires speed compensation before performing idft .",
    "since the target speed is unknown , we compensate the received signal with all possible speed and choose the one with the highest and sharpest idft output .",
    "as it can be seen , the proposed cs significantly improves the detection accuracy as compared to the idft method .",
    "the advantage of the cs approach is more obvious at low snr .",
    "figure [ snr_15_different_pulses ] compares the detection accuracy of the cs and the idft methods for different number of pulses for @xmath110 .",
    "we can easily see that the proposed method requires much fewer pulses than the idft method to achieve the same accuracy level .",
    "for example , the cs approach requires @xmath111 pulses to achieve detection accuracy of @xmath112 , while the idft method needs about @xmath113 pulses in this particular case considered in our simulations .",
    "one trade - off that is not apparent from the simulations is computation time .",
    "convex optimization techniques have much higher computation cost as compared to the idft .",
    "the basis pursuit ( bp ) algorithm used in our simulations has a computation complexity of @xmath114 .",
    "thus the processing speed of the receiver system may put a limit on the number of grid points @xmath115 that can be used and the range resolution @xmath1 .",
    "however there have been other algorithms like orthogonal matching pursuit ( omp ) which have computation complexities of @xmath116 . a decoupled range - speed estimation approach along the lines of @xcite",
    "could also be employed here to reduce complexity .",
    "we have proposed a cs - based sfr system for joint range - speed estimation .",
    "it has been shown by our simulation results that the proposed cs approach can achieve high resolution while employing lower effective bandwidth than traditional sfr systems .",
    "unlike the idft method , the proposed approach does not suffer from range shift and range spreading around the shift positions caused by the movement of targets ."
