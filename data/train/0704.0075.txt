    "babar and belle collaborations observed several excited charmed baryons : @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 last year @xcite , which inspired several investigations of these states in literature @xcite .",
    "we collect the experimental information of these recently observed hadrons in table [ charmed baryon ] .",
    "their quantum numbers have not been determined except @xmath4 . in order to understand their structures using the present experimental information",
    ", we study the strong decay pattern of the excited charmed baryons systematically in this work . in the past decades",
    ", there has been some research work on heavy baryons @xcite .",
    "the quantum numbers and decay widths of s - wave and some p - wave charmed baryons are known @xcite .",
    "we first systematically analyze their strong decays in the framework of the @xmath5 strong decay model .",
    "accordingly one can extract the parameters and estimate the accuracy of the @xmath5 model when it s applied in the charmed baryon system .",
    "then we go one step further and extend the same formalism to study the decay patterns of these new charmed baryons @xmath1 , @xmath6 under different assignments of their quantum numbers . after comparing the theoretical results with the available experimental data",
    ", we can learn their favorable quantum numbers and assignments in the quark model ."
