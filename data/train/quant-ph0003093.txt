    "recently considerable attention has been focussed on the van der waals and casimir forces acting between macroscopic bodies . as for the van der waals force , interest in it",
    "has quickened owing to its application in atomic force microscopy ( see , e.g. , the monographs @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "interest in the casimir force was rekindled after the new experiments @xcite where it was measured more precisely in the case of metallic test bodies .",
    "it is common knowledge that both forces are connected with the existence of zero point vacuum oscillations of the electromagnetic field @xcite . for closely spaced macroscopic bodies the virtual photon emitted by an atom of one body reaches an atom of the second body during its lifetime .",
    "the correlated oscillations of the instantaneous induced dipole moments of those atoms give rise to the non - retarded van der waals force .",
    "the casimir force arises when the distance between two bodies is so large that the virtual photon emitted by an atom of one body can not reach the second body during its lifetime . nevertheless , the correlation of the quantized electromagnetic field in a vacuum state is not equal to zero at two points where the atoms belonging to different bodies are situated .",
    "hence the non - zero correlations of the induced atomic dipole moments arise once more resulting in the casimir force ( which is also known as the retarded van der waals force ) .",
    "as is shown in @xcite , the corrections to the casimir force due to the finite conductivity of the metal and surface roughness play an important role in the proper interpretation of the measurement data .",
    "temperature corrections are negligible in the measurement range of @xcite ( data of @xcite do not support the presence of finite conductivity , surface roughness and temperature corrections which is in disagreement with the theoretically estimated values of these corrections @xcite in the measurement range of @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "the values of the finite conductivity corrections to the casimir force were found by the use of perturbation expansion in relative penetration depth of electromagnetic zero point oscillations into the metal which starts from the general lifshitz formula [ 911 ] .",
    "the parameter of this expansion is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the effective plasma frequency of the electrons , @xmath4 is the distance between interacting bodies . note that the coefficient near the first order correction was obtained in @xcite , and near the second order one in @xcite for the configuration of two plane parallel plates . in @xcite the results of @xcite and , correspondingly , @xcite were modified for the configuration of a spherical lens above a plate . to do this the proximity force theorem",
    "@xcite was applied .",
    "the coefficients to the third and fourth order terms of that expansion were first obtained in @xcite for both configurations .    in applications to atomic force microscopy and the van der waals force the lifshitz formula and plasma model were used in @xcite for different configurations of a tip above a plate . in @xcite ,",
    "the density - functional theory along with the plasma model was used in the calculation of the van der waals force .",
    "more complicated analytical representation for the dielectric permittivity ( drude model with approximate account of absorption bands ) was used in @xcite to calculate the van der waals force between objects covered with a chromium layer with the lifshitz formula .",
    "the parameters of plasma and drude models ( plasma wavelength , electronic relaxation frequency ) are not known very precisely . due to this in @xcite the attempt was undertaken to apply lifshitz formalism numerically to gold , copper , and aluminum ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the tabulated data for the frequency dependent complex refractive index of these metals were used together with the dispersion relation to calculate the values of dielectric permittivity on the imaginary frequency axis .",
    "thereupon the casimir force was calculated in @xcite for configurations of two plates and a spherical lens above a plate in a distance range from 0.05 to 2.5 . the same computation based on lifshitz formalism and",
    "optical tabulated data for the dielectric permittivity was repeated in @xcite in a distance range from 0.1 to 10 .",
    "the two sets of results are in disagreement ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "note that the higher - order perturbative calculations of @xcite in their application range are in agreement with @xcite but also disagree with @xcite .    in this paper we present a brief derivation of the van der waals and casimir energy density and force between two parallel metallic plates or a plate and a sphere covered by the thin layers of another metal ( the configuration used in the experiments @xcite ) .",
    "two plates of sufficient thickness can be modelled by two semi - spaces with some gap between them .",
    "the case of multilayered plane walls was considered in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to @xcite where the removal of the infinities of the zero - point energy was not considered , we present explicitly the details of the regularization procedure and its physical justification .",
    "we next perform an independent computation using optical tabulated data for the frequency dependent complex refractive index of aluminum and gold with the goal to resolve the disagreement between earlier results .",
    "our results turn out to be in agreement with @xcite with a precision of computational error less than 1% .",
    "also the influence of the thin covering metallic layers onto the casimir force is determined .",
    "the range of applicability and exceptions to using the bulk metal optical data for the dielectric permittivity of the thin metallic layers is discussed . for smaller distances the intermediate ( transition ) region between the casimir and van der waals forces",
    "is examined .",
    "it is shown that the transition region is very wide ranging from several nanometers to hundreds of nanometers .",
    "the pure van der waals regime for aluminum and gold is restricted to separations in the interval from 0.5 nm till ( 24)nm only .",
    "the more exact values of the hamaker constant for aluminum and gold are determined with the use of obtained computational data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the general formalism is briefly presented giving the casimir and van der waals forces including the effect of covering layers on the surface of interacting bodies ( two plates or a sphere above a plate ) . in sec .",

    "vii we present conclusions and discussion , in particular , of possible applications of the obtained results in experimental investigations of the casimir force and for obtaining stronger constraints on the constants of hypothetical long - range interactions .",
