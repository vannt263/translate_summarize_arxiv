    "the forward particle production process induced by collisions of high - energy particles is a poorly understood phenomenon in high - energy physics . though it is important to understand the development of cosmic - ray showers in the atmosphere , the validity of hadronic - interaction models have not been sufficiently verified at energies for ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs , @xmath2 10@xmath3 ev ) because of lack of experimental data in this energy range .",
    "this lack of data results into a large uncertainty in the interpretation of the energy and chemical composition of uhecrs .",
    "forward baryons play a very important role in the development of cosmic - ray showers .",
    "if forward baryons carry more collision energy , cosmic - ray showers develop much deeper in the atmosphere , and vice versa .",
    "however , in the energy range of uhecrs , the predictions by current models differ significantly among themselves .",
    "the excess of muons at ground level is reported as one of the problems in the cosmic - ray shower observations .",
    "the number of muons observed by the surface detector array of the pierre auger observatory ( pao ) @xcite is higher than the one expected based on the energy determined by the fluorescence detectors even if a heavy primary mass is assumed @xcite .",
    "it is suggested that the number of ( anti ) baryons generated in the forward region is strongly related to the number of muons observed by pao at the ground @xcite .",
    "therefore , baryon production at the very forward region is quite important to understand cosmic - ray showers .    in this paper , we report the results of analyzing the data of the large hadron collider forward ( lhcf ) experiment for forward neutron spectra .",
    "forward baryon spectra at the laboratory equivalent energy of 2.5@xmath410@xmath5ev ( @xmath0=7tev ) will be a crucial input to improve the hadronic - interaction models used in the air shower analyses .",
    "the lhcf experiment is designed to use the lhc to verify the hadronic - interaction models used in cosmic - ray experiments @xcite .",
    "two independent detectors named arm1 and arm2 were installed in the detector installation slots of the tans located 140 m away from the interaction point 1 ( ip1 ) . because charged particles are swept away by the d1 bending magnets , lhcf can measure only neutral particles in the very forward region of the lhc ( pseudo rapidity @xmath6 ) .",
    "both detectors have two different sampling calorimeters with 44 radiation lengths ( 1.6 hadron - interaction lengths ) of tungsten plates and 16 layers of sampling scintillators @xcite .",
    "four layers of the position sensors ( scifi in arm1 and silicon micro - strip sensor in arm2 ) can measure the hit position transverse to the beam direction .",
    "the transverse dimensions of the calorimeters are 20 mm @xmath4 20 mm and 40 mm @xmath4 40 mm in arm1 , and 25 mm @xmath4 25 mm and 32 mm @xmath4 32 mm in arm2 .",
    "the details of the detector performance during the 20092010 proton  proton collisions are reported in @xcite .",
    "the performance of the lhcf detectors for hadron measurements was studied by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and confirmed by using 350 gev proton beams at cern - sps @xcite .",
    "depending on the incident - neutron energy , the energy resolution and position resolution are about 40% and 0.11.3 mm , respectively .",
    "the detection efficiency for neutrons was estimated to be 70%80% for neutrons above 500 gev .",
    "in this paper we assume hadronic showers are produced by neutrons . according to the epos 1.99 generator @xcite ,",
    "about 10% of other hadrons , i.e. , @xmath7s and k@xmath8s , are also included in the data and this fraction and the energy dependence are model dependent .",
    "the data used in this analysis were obtained on may 15 , 2010 from proton  proton collisions at @xmath0 = 7 tev ( lhc fill # 1104 ) . the typical luminosity corresponding to this fill derived from the counting rate of the lhcf front counters @xcite was ( 6.36.5 ) @xmath9 .",
    "the data set was the same as one used in the previously published photon analysis results , and additional details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the trigger for lhcf events was generated when signals from any three successive scintillation layers in any calorimeter exceeded a predefined threshold ( typically 130 minimum ionizing particles ( mips ) ) .",
    "data acquisition ( daq ) was performed under 85.7% ( arm1 ) and 67.0% ( arm2 ) average live - times . 0",
    "the trigger for lhcf events was generated at three levels .",
    "the first - level trigger was generated from beam pickup signals when a bunch passed ip1 .",
    "a shower trigger was generated when signals from any three successive scintillation layers in any calorimeter exceeded a predefined threshold .",
    "the second - level trigger for shower events ( l2ta ) was issued when the data acquisition system was armed .",
    "data were recorded by the third - level trigger ( l3 t ) when all other types of second - level triggers ( such as pedestal and laser calibration ) were combined .",
    "the l2ta and l3 t triggers , which triggered the onset of data recording , were generated independently for the arm1 and arm2 detectors .",
    "data acquisition ( daq ) was performed under 85.7% ( arm1 ) and 67.0% ( arm2 ) average live - times .",
    "taking the daq live - times into account , the integrated luminosities of the data set were 0.68 nb@xmath10 for arm1 and 0.53 nb@xmath10 for arm2 , each with @xmath116.1% uncertainty .",
    "the numbers of inelastic collisions were about 48 m and 38 m collisions for arm1 and arm2 , respectively .",
    "mc predictions were conducted with the generators dpmjet 3.04 @xcite , epos 1.99 @xcite , pythia 8.145 @xcite , qgsjet ii-03 @xcite , and sybill 2.1 @xcite and compared with the experimental results . in the mc simulations , the cosmos ( v7.49 ) and epics ( v8.81 )",
    "@xcite libraries that are used in air - shower and detector simulations were used to simulate the flight of particles from the ip1 to the detectors and the response of the detectors .",
    "about 10 m inelastic collisions were simulated for each model .",
    "initially , the offline - event selection was applied when energy depositions equivalent to more than 200 mips were recorded for three successive layers in addition to the experimental trigger .",
    "the positions at which particles hit the detector were determined by using the position sensors . because reconstruction of the events is difficult at the edge of the calorimeters due to large fluctuations in the energy deposition , events within 2 mm from the edge were discarded from the analysis .",
    "the lateral shower leakage caused by the limited lateral size of the detectors deteriorates the energy resolution .",
    "this position - dependent leakage effect was corrected by using the transverse - hit position measured by the position sensors .",
    "particle identification ( pid ) between neutrons and photons was based on the difference in the longitudinal shape of the shower development .",
    "two simple parameters called @xmath12 and @xmath13 were introduced to characterize the shower shape .",
    "these parameters were defined as the depths containing 20% and 90% , respectively , of the total energy deposited within the layers .",
    "considering the correlation between @xmath12 and @xmath13 an optimized parameter l@xmath14 was defined as @xmath15 to improve the selection efficiency and purity than previous analyses .",

    "two distinct peaks are identified in the observed l@xmath14 distribution indicated by the closed circles .",
    "the histograms correspond to the mc prediction of pure photons ( red ) and pure neutrons ( blue ) and they are called ` templates ' hereafter . the templates were produced by accumulating the mc simulation as a mixture of five models , dpmjet 3.04 , epos 1.99 , pythia 8.145 , qgsjet ii-03 , and sybill 2.1 , with same statistics for each . to obtain neutron spectra ,",
    "only events with the parameter l@xmath14 exceeding a certain threshold were identified as neutron - like events .",
    "the effects of the neutron selection efficiency and the photon contamination were corrected by using the efficiency @xmath16 and purity @xmath17 ( i.e. , multiplying by @xmath18 ) determined by mc simulations and the template fitting method @xcite , respectively . to estimate the photon contamination ,",
    "the templates for photons and hadrons were independently scaled to reproduce the experimental results ( called method a ) .",
    "the open circles in figure [ fig : l2d ] represent the fitting result with method a. neutron selection criteria , as indicated in figure [ fig : l2d ] , were chosen to maximize @xmath19 . to cope with energy dependence",
    ", events were separated into eight different energy ranges according to reconstructed energy .",
    "after correcting the pid efficiency and purity , we obtain the production rate of neutrons as a function of obtained energy that was determined from the total deposited energy in the calorimeter and from the identity of the particle .",
    "details of the event reconstruction for neutrons are summarized in @xcite .",
    "about 0.3 million neutron - like events passed the pid selection for each arm .    to combine the results of arm1 and arm2 , we selected events that occurred within the common rapidity regions .",
    "events within 6 mm ( @xmath20 ) from the beam center were selected for the small towers .",
    "the large towers of arm1 and arm2 were divided into two regions .",
    "the inner region `` a '' was defined by a radius of 2835 mm ( @xmath21 ) from the beam center , whereas the outer region `` b '' was defined by a radius of 3542 mm ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "for the analysis , we used azimuthal - angle intervals @xmath23 of @xmath24 for the small towers and @xmath25 for the large towers .      * energy scale",
    "* + in order to determine energy scale and estimate its systematic uncertainty , we followed the previous analyses @xcite .",
    "we observed invariant mass excesses of 8.1% ( arm1 ) and 3.7% ( arm2 ) compared with the @xmath26 mass reconstructed in the mc simulations .",
    "these excesses were corrected in this analysis . based on this mass excess correction and known calibration uncertainty , totally @xmath115.6% ( arm1 ) and @xmath114.4% ( arm2 )",
    "were assigned as systematic uncertainties with respect to the central value of the mass shift .",
    "in addition , according to the differences between the sps beam test and mc simulation in the reconstructed energy of 350 gev proton showers @xcite , + 2.0% ( arm1 ) and -3.8% ( arm2 ) errors were quadratically added to the respective energy scale uncertainties .",
    "+   + * pid * + method a described in section [ sec : reconst ] did not perfectly reproduce the experimental results . to estimate systematic effects from these differences , we used a more artificial method ( method b ) that allows longitudinal displacements and modifications in width of the distributions to fit the experimental results .",
    "the systematic uncertainty from the pid process was estimated by comparing the results using the method a and method b. the energy - dependent pid systematic uncertainty is mostly 1% above 1.5 tev and 12% at most below this energy .",

    "the numbers of photons were obtained from the previous analysis @xcite and the same analysis for the pseudo - rapidity range 8.99 - 9.22 defined in this study .",
    "the experimental data show the highest neutron ratio compared with the hadronic - interaction models for all rapidity regions .",
    "an initial analysis of neutron spectra at the very forward region of the lhc is presented in this paper .",
    "the data were acquired in may 2010 at the lhc from @xmath0 = 7 tev proton ",
    "proton collisions with integrated luminosity of 0.68 nb@xmath10 and 0.53 nb@xmath10 for the lhcf arm1 and arm2 detectors , respectively .",
    "the neutron energy spectra were analyzed in the three different rapidity regions .",
    "the results obtained from the two independent calorimeters of arm1 and arm2 are consistent each other .",
    "the measured spectra were combined and unfolded by using a two - dimensional unfolding method based on bayesian theory .",
    "the experimental results , both in folded and unfolded were compared with the mc predictions of qgsjet ii-03 , epos 1.99 , dpmjet 3.04 , pythia 8.145 , and sybill 2.1 ; however , no model perfectly reproduces the experimental results in the whole pseudo - rapidity range .",
    "moreover , compared with the hadronic - interaction models , the experimental results show the most abundant neutron production relative to the photon production rate .",
    "because of the difference in the phase space , neutrons at lower rapidity carry more energy than those at higher rapidity .",
    "epos and qgsjet ii , current standard models in the air shower analysis , underestimate the neutron production to about 30% at the lower rapidity regions .",
    "it is interesting to investigate how these differences affect to the development of air showers .",
    "the differential cross sections for neutron production at very forward rapidity were measured at the intersecting storage ring for proton  proton collisions at @xmath0 = 30.662.7 gev @xcite and by the phenix experiment at the relativistic heavy ion collider for proton  proton collisions at @xmath0 = 200 gev @xcite .",
    "the results of previous experiments were consistent with feynman x ( @xmath29 ) scaling and do not depend on the collision energy . to accurately extrapolate the hadronic - interaction models to the high - energy range ( independently of whether or not the @xmath29 scaling in the neutron production is still relevant at energies in the tev range )",
    "is also an important issue .",
    "lhcf will extend the energy range to test the feynman scaling with the proton ",
    "proton collision data obtained at @xmath0= 0.9 , 2.76 , 7tev and to be obtained at @xmath0=13tev in 2015 .",
    "we would like to express our gratitude to the cern staff for their essential contribution to the operation of lhcf .",
    "this study was supported by grant - in - aids for scientific research by mext of japan , by the grant - in - aid for nagoya university gcoe `` qfpu '' from mext , and by the istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare ( infn ) in italy .",
