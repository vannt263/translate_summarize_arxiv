    "the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) represent a unique example of star - forming , dwarf interacting galaxies in the local group .",
    "moreover , the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) system is embedded in the milky way gravitational potential , thus their dynamical history strongly affects the evolution of our own galaxy .",
    "yet , we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the dynamical history of the complex system mcs - milky way . from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "two scenarios have emerged : the first - infall ( unbound ) scenario @xcite , and the multiple - passage ( bound ) scenario @xcite . in the former",
    ", the mcs have been interacting between each other for most of the hubble time , also experiencing at least one close encounter ( @xmath9 500 myr ago ) , while they are just past their first pericentric passage . in the more classical bound scenario , the milky way potential determines the orbits of the mcs , that formed as independent satellites and only recently ( @xmath92 gyr ago ) become a binary system of galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a thorough review ) .",
    "even though it has proved to be challenging to distinguish between the two scenarios on the basis of observational constraints , evidence is mounting that the clouds are now approaching the milky way for the first time @xcite .",
    "in particular , detailed three - dimensional study of the lmc kinematics obtained from the hubble space telescope shows that the relative orientation of the velocity vectors implies at least one close encounter in the past 500 myr @xcite .",
    "this is further supported by the distribution of ob stars in the clouds and the bridge ( a stream of neutral hydrogen that connects the mcs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which suggests a recent ( @xmath9200 myr ago ) exchange of material @xcite .",
    "in this context , the irregular morphology of the clouds is shaped by their reciprocal interaction .",
    "recent dynamical simulations @xcite show that the off - centre , warped stellar bar of the lmc , and its one - armed spiral naturally arise from a direct collision with the smc .",
    "thus , the observed morphology of the lmc can be directly related to its dynamical history .",
    "this is the first paper of a series aimed at investigating the morphology , the kinematics and the chemical abundances of the large and small magellanic clouds by adopting classical cepheids as tracers of the young stellar populations in these galaxies . in the current investigation ,",
    "we focus our attention on the lmc geometry and three - dimensional structure , by using cepheids optical ( @xmath1,@xmath0 ) and near - infrared ( nir , @xmath2,@xmath3 and @xmath4 ) period - luminosity ( pl ) and period - wesenheit ( pw ) relations .",
    "the lmc viewing angles , the inclination @xmath6 and the position angle p.a . of the lines of nodes ( the intersection of the galaxy plane and the sky plane ) , are basics parameters that describe the directions towards which we observe the lmc disk .",
    "the determination of such angles has major implications on the the determination of the dynamical state of the milky - way  mcs system .",
    "for instance , the uncertainty on the determinations on these angles affects the quoted results on the lmc kinematics , because they are needed to transform the line - of - sight velocities and proper motions into circular velocities , and , in turn , to determine the orbits of the stars .",
    "the lmc viewing angle estimates available in the literature span a wide range of values .",
    "it is somehow expected that different stellar tracers and methods will provide different results because @xmath10 the old and young stellar populations in the lmc show different geometrical distributions @xcite , and @xmath11 these distributions are non - axisymmetric , so results also depend on the fraction of the galaxy covered by the adopted tracer",

    "interestingly enough , the position angle found by @xcite agrees quite well with the value estimated by @xcite using the kinematics of young stars ( @xmath2050 myr ) .",

    "the large spread of the values summarised above shows how complex it is to estimate the lmc viewing angles , and how difficult it is to correctly estimate both the statistical and the systematic error associated to the measurements . in this paper",
    "we provide a new estimate of the lmc viewing angles , taking advantage of the opportunity to complement the large sample of lmc cepheids recently released by the ogle - iv survey , with nir observations .",

    "the best - fit parameters of each relation are given in table  [ tab3 ] . ]",
    "note that the current value of the slope for the pw@xmath50 relation differs at the 2.3@xmath56 level with the slope found by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath57 vs @xmath58 )",
    ". however , the difference is vanishing if we consider the dispersion around the relation , namely @xmath41=0.08 mag for both the above estimates .",
    "the marginal difference in the slope is the consequence of different assumptions in dealing with outliers , namely 3@xmath41 @xcite vs 6@xmath41 ( ours ) .",
    "using the same @xmath41 clipping we find @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which perfectly agree with the values found by @xcite .",
    "however , the latter cut removes 15% of the cepheids in the sample , while the former only the 3% .",
    "note that the standard deviations of the pw@xmath50 relation is minimally affected by the different assumptions concerning the @xmath41 clipping ( @xmath61 mag in the case of the 6@xmath41-clipping , and @xmath62 mag in the case of the 3@xmath41-clipping ) .",
    "the last column in table  [ tab3 ] gives the standard deviation around the best - fit for all the pl and pw relations derived in this investigation .",
    "the observed standard deviation for the pw@xmath50 relations is , as expected , smaller than the ones of the pw@xmath48 and pw@xmath49 relations , given the higher accuracy of the ogle photometry .",
    "in fact , the standard deviation decreases for all the wesenheit indices that include optical data , because they are affected by smaller photometric errors when compared with purely nir wesenheit . by adopting all these different relations ,",
    "we can obtain different distance estimates for each star , with associated errors that are given by the propagation of the uncertainty on the mean magnitude and the uncertainty on the slopes of the pw relation adopted , plus the systematic error given by its intrinsic dispersion , as described in the following .",
    "the measurement error on the individual distance moduli obtained by adopting the pw@xmath50 relation is the sum in quadrature of the photometric error on the wesenheit mean magnitudes and the error on the slope @xmath56 , which is anyway negligible ( 0.001 mag ) .",
    "this means that the error can be propagated directly from the photometric error on the optical mean magnitudes , and ranges from 0.01 mag ( brighter cepheids ) to 0.04 mag ( fainter cepheids ) , i.e. 1%3% in distance .",
    "on the other hand , theoretical predictions give us an upper limit for the systematic error related to the i d , which is 0.06 mag , or @xmath95% in distance .",
    "summarising , while the precision of cepheid individual distances based on the pw@xmath50 is better than 3% , the accuracy is limited to @xmath95% .",
    "if we use the pw@xmath49 relations , the errors on individual distance moduli ranges from 0.03 mag ( @xmath63 0.7 ) to 0.10 mag ( @xmath64 0.7 ) , if we exclude the 2mass sub - sample , and to 0.15 mag if we include it , which translates to 2%15% in distance . instead ,",
    "if we choose the pw@xmath48 relations , errors are even larger ( up to 20% ) as a consequence of the larger coefficient adopted in the wesenheit definition ( @xmath65=1.630 ) respect to the one in the w@xmath49 ( @xmath66=1.046 ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite found that the pw@xmath48 relation are more affected by uncertainties on the slope of the reddening law .",
    "thus , we adopted the nir pw@xmath49 relation , which is minimally affected by such uncertainty .",
    "in fact , the uncertainty on the assumed reddening law also contributes to the systematics .",
    "recently , @xcite found that in the 30 doradus star forming region , the reddening law changes and in particular the total - to - selective extinction is @xmath67 , thus larger than the one adopted here , i.e. @xmath68 .",
    "however , if we compute the coefficient of the w@xmath49 corresponding to @xmath67 , we find a discrepancy lower than 1% ( 1.041 vs 1.046 ) , which minimally affects our results , while for the optical bands this discrepancy is of the order of 20% ( 1.70 vs 1.55 ) .",
    "if we assume @xmath69 , we find a slope of the pw@xmath50 relation which is steeper of 0.04 mag with respect to the one listed in table  [ tab3 ] , while the slope of the pw@xmath49 relation only changes of 0.01 mag .",
    "thus , the systematic error due to the uncertainty on the total - to - selective absorption ratio is at 2% level for the optical and at 0.5% level for the nir .",
    "moreover , the theoretical predictions in table  [ tab3 ] indicate that the i d for the pw@xmath49 relation is @xmath200.03 mag , which corresponds to an accuracy better then 2% on the individual distance estimates .",
    "thus , the precision of cepheid individual distances based on the pw@xmath49 highly depend on the sub - sample adopted , and it ranges from 2% to 10% , when excluding the 2mass sub - sample , and to 15% when including it , while the systematic effects are lower than 2% .",
    "concluding , cepheids distances derived on the basis of optical relations are affected by significant systematics ( @xmath97% ) , while distances derived on the basis of nir relations are mostly limited by measurement errors ( 2%15% ) .",
    "we adopted the pw@xmath50 and pw@xmath49 relations listed in table  [ tab3 ] for the fu and fo cepheids in order to estimate the distances to all the cepheids in our sample  a.    the individual relative distance moduli have been estimated by calculating the differences : @xmath70 where @xmath54 and @xmath71 are the coefficients in table  [ tab3 ] for the corresponding pw relations and @xmath72 is the mean wesenheit magnitude for the @xmath6-th star in the given bands .",
    "figure  [ fn ] shows the projection onto the plane of the sky of the cepheids in our sample , color coded by their individual relative distance moduli obtained by adopting the optical pw@xmath50 relation ( left panel ) and the nir pw@xmath49 relation ( right panel ) .",
    "the color coding clearly shows that that the eastern parts of the lmc bar and northern arm are closer to us ( negative distance moduli ) with respect to the western regions ( positive distance moduli ) , thus indicating that the lmc is not seen face - on , but it is inclined respect to the plane of the sky ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to measure such viewing angles , we first need to convert the relative distance moduli given by equation  [ eq0 ] into individual absolute distances ( kpc ) .",

    "thus , we use the individual distances @xmath76 to move into the cartesian reference system introduced by @xcite and @xcite . this new reference system ( @xmath77,@xmath78,@xmath79 )",

    "the ( @xmath87,@xmath88,@xmath89 ) coordinates for each cepheid are then obtained using the transformation equations @xmath90 because of its non - axis - symmetric shape , the lmc disk does not have a very well defined center .",
    "thus , the definition of ( @xmath84,@xmath85,@xmath86 ) is somewhat arbitrary and @xcite showed that it does not affect the results .",
    "we estimated the center of the cepheid distribution by computing the center of mass as follows : @xmath91 where @xmath92 are the coordinates @xmath80 and @xmath81 of the @xmath6-th star and the weights @xmath93 is given by its inverse distance in the 2d - space ( @xmath80,@xmath81 ) . to compare our results with similar findings from other authors",
    ", we also adopted four different locations for the center of the distribution available in the literature .",
    "table  [ tab4 ] lists all the adopted values together with their i d .",
    "in particular , we adopted the center of the rotation map of the hi estimated by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cii@xmath94 ) , the center of the visual - band isophotes estimated by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ciii@xmath94 ) and the geometrical center estimated by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* civ@xmath94 ) from 2mass data for lmc cepheids .",
    "once we have the @xmath87,@xmath88 , and @xmath89 for each star in the cartesian system , we derive the orientation , i.e. , inclination @xmath6 and position angle p.a , of the lmc disk , by fitting a plane solution of the form : @xmath95    to estimate the best - fitting plane , we performed a least - squares method where @xmath77 and @xmath78 has been considered the independent variables .",
    "in fact , from equation  [ eq1 ] follows that the error on @xmath96 is larger the errors on @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the dominant term in the error budget is given by the uncertainty on the distance @xmath76 , since the positions on the sky ( @xmath80,@xmath81 ) are known with a precision better than 0@xmath35.2 @xcite from the ogle catalog .",
    "in particular , @xmath99 while the error on @xmath89 also accounts for the uncertainty on @xmath86 : @xmath100 figure  [ f7b ] shows a comparison between the errors @xmath101 for distances obtained from the optical pw relations ( left ) and for the ones based on the nir pw relations ( right ) .",
    "the cepheids are plotted in the @xmath77,@xmath78 plane and color - coded by their error @xmath101 on @xmath79 , which ranges from @xmath90.5 kpc ( optical , nir ) to @xmath201 kpc in the case of the optical data , and to @xmath204.5 kpc in the case of the nir data .",
    "however , we find an error @xmath102 1 kpc only for the cepheids belonging to the 2mass sub - sample .",
    "thus , the limited photometric accuracy on the 2mass data is the main culprit of the limited accuracy of our results based on the nir distances .",

    "the inclination @xmath6 of the disk @xmath108 the ensuing errors on the above angles can also be determined by propagating the errors on the best - fit parameters as discussed in the following section .",
    "the values we found for the lmc are listed in table  [ tab5 ] , together with a list of literature values for comparison .          by assuming that @xmath103 is a constant",

    "the errors associated on the coefficients are computed according to the least - square method we adopted for the fit .",
    "we used the idl package mpfit to perform the fit , which provides the formal 1-@xmath41 error for each parameter , computed from the covariance matrix , where individual measurements are weighted with the inverse of the associated error .",
    "the errors on @xmath87,@xmath88 and @xmath89 for each star have been computed as described in the previous section .",
    "data listed in table  [ tab5 ] display several interesting features worth being discussed in more detail .    _",
    "i ) internal consistency_the current estimates of the p.a .",
    "( column 2 ) and of the inclination ( column 3 ) are , within the errors , minimally affected by the adopted center . moreover and even more importantly , we provided independent estimates using optical and nir mean magnitudes .",
    "the two data sets are affected by different measurements and systematic errors , as already discussed in section  3 .",
    "therefore , we can perform an average to obtain our best estimate and adopt the spread in the values as a solid estimates of the systematic error : @xmath120 ( statistical )  @xmath121 ( systematic ) and p.a .",
    "= 150@xmath12220(statistical )  @xmath123(systematic ) .",
    "we also compared the lmc viewing angles obtained by adopting independently either fu or fo cepheids and we found that the p.a .",
    "differ of @xmath124 ( optical ) and @xmath125 ( nir ) , while inclinations differ of @xmath126.4 ( optical ) and @xmath127 ( nir ) .",
    "however , the values based on fu cepheids agree within @xmath128 with the values based on the the entire sample , and with the adopted best value .",
    "the viewing angles based on fo cepheids differ of about at 4@xmath41 level ( @xmath129 ) with the solution based on the entire sample and with the adopted best value .",
    "the above difference between fu and fo cepheids appears the consequence that fo cepheids account for less than 40% of the entire sample .",
    "the spatial distribution of fu and fo cepheids shows also some diversity , with the fo cepheids more extended in the outer disk when compared with the fu ones ( see , e.g. , figure  [ f1 ] ) . to quantify the quoted variations we also investigated the change in viewing angles as a function of the distance from the center of the lmc .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fr1 ] , where the variation in inclination and p.a .",
    "are plotted as a function of the radius , in the case of distances based on the optical ( dark cyan dots ) and on the nir ( dark red dots ) data . in the left panel of this figure , the distribution in the plane @xmath77,@xmath78 of the lmc cepheids is shown .",
    "we defined circular regions in this plane , with radius from 0.5 to 6.5 kpc with a step of 0.5 kpc , and considered all the cepheids included inside such regions to determine the viewing angles .",
    "the values found at different radii are plotted in the left panel and show that values based on cepheids located inside a radius of @xmath93 kpc from the center differ significantly from the values based on larger area .",
    "this is not surprising , since the central regions are dominated by the bar and have a complex geometry .",
    "moreover , the discrepancy between viewing angles based on optical and nir data in these regions might be related to a possible change of the reddening law in the more extincted regions of the lmc bar @xcite . on the other hand , values based on the outer regions are in excellent agreement with each other , and there is no solid evidence of a change of the viewing angles with radial distance .",
    "_ ii ) external consistency_the current estimates of lmc viewing angles agree well with similar estimates based on classical cepheids available in the literature .",
    "the excellent agreement between our values and the values found by @xcite , on the basis of the same sample from the ogle - iv ccs demonstrates once again the robustness and precision of the approach adopted . the position angle derived by @xcite from independent datasets agrees also very well with our best estimate , while their inclination is larger .",
    "the difference in inclination is likely due to the improved accuracy on mean nir magnitude from single epoch measurements ( see section  2 and their section  3.2 ) and also to the sample ( our sample is a factor 2 larger , see also section  8) .",
    "the comparison with the estimates provided by p04 indicates a good agreement for the inclination , but a 2@xmath41 difference in the pa .",
    "however , their sample is again significantly smaller ( 92 vs @xmath9 3,700 ) and biased towards brightest stars .",
    "similar arguments apply to the estimate provided by @xcite , since they only adopted optical mean magnitudes provided by ogle - iii , which was limited to a smaller area close to the lmc bar .",
    "_ iii ) age consistency_recent estimates of the lmc viewing angles provided by @xcite using red super giants ( rsgs ) agree quite well with current estimates .",
    "this is an interesting findings for a twofold reason : @xmath10 the quoted authors adopted a completely different approach to estimate the viewing angle , based on kinematics . @xmath11",
    "the difference in age from short to long  period lmc cepheids , estimated on the basis of period - age relations , is of the order of 300 myr , while rsg have typically ages of few tens of myr @xcite.thus , the similarity between the geometrical proprieties of the two tracers implies that rsgs and cepheids belong to the same young population .    _",
    "iv ) comparison with intermediate - age stellar populations_the lmc viewing angles provided by @xcite using rc stars agree quite well with current estimates .",
    "this is an interesting finding , given that the accuracy of individual distances of rc stars is still lively debated in the literature , since it might be affected by differences in the underlying stellar populations .",
    "the lmc viewing angles estimated by @xcite using agb stars show a difference at the 2@xmath41 level .",
    "it is not clear whether the difference is mainly caused by the lmc area covered by their sample , which extends further than the region were cepheids are located , or by a possible mix of old and intermediate  age agb stars .    _",
    "v ) comparison with old stellar populations_very accurate lmc viewing angles have been recently provided by @xcite using a large sample ( @xmath913,000 ) of rr lyrae stars covering a significant fraction of the lmc body .",
    "they found a position angle that is at least 25 degrees larger than the current one , moreover , the inclination angle is at least two degree smaller .",
    "this difference taken at face value is further confirming that old and young stellar populations in the lmc have different radial distributions and likely a different center of mass .",
    "similar differences in radial distributions have already been found in several nearby dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "this difference also appears in the chemical composition of the two populations .",
    "indeed , @xcite found evidence that the old and intermediate - age populations in the carina dwarf spheroidal display different mean iron and magnesium abundances . thus suggesting that they experienced different chemical enrichment histories .",
    "a similar empirical scenario is also disclosed by lmc cepheids and rr lyrae stars .",
    "recent spectroscopic investigations based on high - resolution spectra indicate that the metallicity distribution of lmc cepheids is centred on [ fe / h]=-0.33 with a standard deviation of 0.13 dex @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "spectroscopic measurements of lmc rr lyrae based on low - resolution spectra @xcite indicate a mean [ fe / h]@xmath9 - 1.5 standard deviation of 0.5 dex .    the above evidence are further supporting the hypothesis that the lmc old and young stellar populations have had significantly different chemical enrichment histories .    in this context it is worth mentioning that the lmc viewing angles provided by @xcite using rgs are quite different when compared with rr lyrae stars . the inclination is more than 1.5@xmath41 larger , while the position angle is significantly smaller .",
    "a detailed analysis of the difference is beyond the aim of the current investigation .",
    "however , we note that rg are not `` pure '' old tracers , since intermediate - mass stars also contribute to the field population .",
    "the use of a multi - wavelength fitting of the reddening law to apparent distance moduli of extra - galactic cepheids , to determine their distances and reddening , was introduced by @xcite and has been recently revised by @xcite .",
    "the above method is based on the evidence that the true distance modulus of the @xmath6-th cepheid belonging to a stellar system can be written in the following form : @xmath130    where @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the coefficients of the adopted reddening law @xcite .",
    "fitting this relation to the apparent distance moduli of the same cepheid estimated using different photometric bands and by extrapolating to @xmath134 , we can determine its true distance modulus .",
    "adopting the observed pl relations in the @xmath135 , @xmath4 and @xmath5-bands ; @xmath136 ; @xmath137 ; @xmath138 ; @xmath139;@xmath140 . ]",
    "bands we can derive apparent distance moduli at six different wavelengths for all the cepheids in our sample  b. the inclusion of the @xmath5-band mean magnitudes allow us to overcome possible systematics in the extrapolation to extremely long wavelengths . by assuming @xmath141 and performing a fit of the above equation we can evaluate the true distance modulus and the color excess for individual cepheids .",
    "the zero - points of the six observed pl relations were calibrated following the same approach used in @xcite .",
    "we adopted nine fu cepheids for which hst parallaxes are available @xcite .",
    "the fo pl relations were calibrated only using polaris @xcite .",
    "the optical and nir mean magnitude of these calibrating cepheids have been accurately measured @xcite , however , @xmath5-band light curves for the same cepheids are not available , since they are saturated in the survey . fortunately enough , the difference in the photometric zero - point between the @xmath5-band adopted by wise and the [ 3.6]-band adopted by spitzer is vanishing ( m. marengo private communication ) . therefore , the @xmath5-band fu and fo pl relations were calibrated using the mean [ 3.6 ] magnitudes for calibrating cepheids based on spitzer observations provided by @xcite",
    ". figure  [ f9 ] shows the apparent distance moduli for three selected cepheids in our sample ( green , red and magenta dots ) as a function of @xmath77 and the best - fits estimated using eq .  5 ( green , red and magenta solid lines ) .",
    "the individual true distance moduli and the color excess are labeled together with their errors .",
    "the error bars also account for the systematic errors related to the position of the cepheids inside the instability strip compared with the ridge line of the adopted pl relation .",
    "individual distances based on pl relations rely on the assumption that the width in temperature of the instability strip can be neglected @xcite . on the other hand , distances based on plc relations",
    "are not affected by this drawback @xcite . to quantify this systematic error we adopted the standard deviations of theoretical pl relations in the above six bands and they are listed in table  2 .",
    "this is an upper limit to the standard deviations of the pl relations , since predictions cover the entire period range and uniformly fill the instability strip .",
    "even a cursory look to the values listed in table  2 shows that the standard deviations , as expected , steadily decrease for increasing wavelength .",
    "the difference is caused by the fact that cooler cepheids become in nir and in mir systematically brighter due to a stronger sensitivity of the bolometric correction @xcite . in the case of the @xmath5-band we adopted the dispersion around the spitzer [ 3.6]@xmath27 m pl relation provided by @xcite , i.e. , 0.025 mag .",
    "the approach we adopted to estimate the error budget implies that we automatically weight more the apparent distance moduli based on nir- and mir mean magnitudes than the distances based on optical bands .",
    "the total error is then propagated on the parameters estimated by our least - squares fitting procedure .",
    "it is worth noting that current individual distance moduli , taking account for systematic errors , have an accuracy better than 1% , while individual extinctions have an accuracy better than 15% .",
    "the individual reddening estimates were smoothed using a gaussian kernel with a @xmath41 equal to the observed uncertainty .",
    "the smoothed reddening distribution was adopted to provide the reddening map shown in figure  [ f11 ] .        the star forming region of 30  doradus stands out in the reddening map as the most extincted region on the lmc bar , while on the other side of the bar , the star forming regions associated with ngc  1850 and ngc  1858 are also heavily extincted and they can also be easily identified .",
    "the reddening across the lmc disk is , as expected , quite low with the exception of these peculiar regions .",
    "we also derived the average lmc true distance modulus and reddening .",
    "the statistical error associated to the distance modulus is dominated by the number of bands available , and in our case it is significantly small , and indeed the values range from 0.008 to 0.015 mag .",
    "figure  [ f10 ] shows the histogram of the distance moduli distribution for fu ( blue bars ) and fo cepheids ( red bars ) .",
    "we find a median distance modulus @xmath142 mag for both fu and fo pulsators , where the error is given by the standard dispersion around the median .",
    "the current distance moduli based on fu and fo cepheids are in excellent agreement with each others and with the value recently published by p13 , i.e. , 18.493 mag @xmath7 0.008 ( statistical ) @xmath7 0.047 ( systematic ) .",
    "however , note that both distances and reddening values display neither a symmetric nor a gaussian distribution .",
    "this means that the median values need to be cautiously treated .",
    "thus , we only adopted the median value of the entire ( fu@xmath143fo ) sample for the purpose of comparing it to similar values in the literature and we found that our estimate @xmath144 mag , is in excellent agreement ( within @xmath128 ) with the value estimated by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter h11 ) using rc stars ( @xmath145 mag ) , and rr lyraes ( @xmath146 ) mag .",
    "distribution for fu ( blue bars ) and fo ( red bars ) cepheids obtained from equation  [ eq4 ] .",
    "the blue dot indicates the median distance from the fu cepheids distribution , while the error bar indicates the 1@xmath41 dispersion around the median , @xmath41=0.10 mag .",
    "the red dots shows the same for fo cepheids , with @xmath41=0.11 mag .",
    "we thus find a median distance modulus to the lmc @xmath27=18.48 @xmath7 0.10 mag for both fu and fo cepheids .",
    "the above value is in excellent agreement with the mean distance modulus by p13 , which is accurate to 2.2% . ]    however , individual distances and reddening are strongly related to the spatial distribution of the cepheids in the lmc , as discussed in the previous sections .",
    "thus , we need to compare individual values and in particular we can compare @xmath147 values for @xmath91,000 stars located at positions for which reddening from h11 is available .",
    "we download their catalog from the website : http://dc.zah.uni-heidelberg.de/mcx .",
    "the catalog provides mean reddening values for specific spatial bins whose coordinates are also available .",
    "we estimated the mean @xmath147 values in the same spatial bins but from our reddening map .",
    "we first determined the number of cepheids included in each bin , and we only considered bins that contain at least one cepheid .",
    "we found @xmath9500 bins that include from two to eight cepheids .",
    "finally , we estimated the difference in reddening from our mean values and the values by h11 for the same bin .",
    "we found that the difference is smaller than 1@xmath148 for @xmath985% of the bins , where the error @xmath148 is given by the sum in quadrature of the error on @xmath147 from h11(30400% ) and from our estimates ( 0.210% ) .",
    "moreover , our new reddening map has two significant advantages when compared to the map provided by h11 : @xmath10 it covers a double area of the lmc ( 80 vs 40 square degrees ) , and in particular , it covers the whole disk for the very first time ; @xmath11 it is characterised by a much higher accuracy . the total error ( including systematics ) on",
    "the reddening is smaller than 10% , which is one order of magnitude better than the typical accuracy of existing reddening maps .    to further quantify the accuracy of the current reddening estimates",
    ", we performed a detailed comparison with accurate reddening measurements available in the literature . recently , p13 measured extinction for eight double eclipsing binary systems ( debs ) located in the bar and on the left arm of the lmc .",
    "we performed a beam search of 5 in radius around these systems and computed the median extinction from the cepheids included in these radius .",
    "the comparison between the values based on cepheids and the ones obtained by p13 is shown in table  [ tab6 ] .",
    "the redding values are in excellent agreement for six out of the eight systems for which we found the match . in two cases ( ogle - lmc - ecl-26122 , ogle - lmc - ecl-09114 ) , our reddening values are lower than the ones obtained by p13 . however , on the basis of their individual distances these two systems seem to be located behind the plane of the lmc disk , and thus they might suffer a higher extinction when compared with cepheids located in the lmc bar .",
    "@xcite find an extinction of @xmath149 mag for the cepheid ogle - lmc - cep-0227 , belonging to a detached double - lined eclipsing binary system located at ( @xmath80 , @xmath81)=(73@xmath21.0654,-70@xmath21.2420 ) .",
    "we found a median extinction @xmath150 mag for the cepheids at 5 in radius from this system , thus in perfect agreement with the value by @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite estimates the distance and reddening to the ogle - lmc - ecl-25658 binary system , which is located at ( @xmath80 , @xmath81)=(90.4949,-68.5153 ) .",
    "they found @xmath151 mag , while we found @xmath152 mag for a cepheids located at ( @xmath80 , @xmath81)=(90.2155,-67.8089 ) and @xmath153 mag for a cepheids located at ( @xmath80 , @xmath81)=(90.6012,-69.2539 ) .",
    "the comparison with literature values further supports the precision and the accuracy of the reddening map we estimated using classical cepheids as tracers of stellar populations in the lmc disk .",
    "the accurate individual reddening values we determined for all the cepheids in our sample  b , allow us to determine new pl relations for the lmc cepheids in six different bands .",
    "we adopted the following absorption coefficients for unit of @xmath154 : a@xmath155,a@xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 , to transform the @xmath154 values into the absorption in each band .",
    "thus , we computed the reddening - corrected magnitude for each cepheid in each band and performed a least - squares fit to determine the pl relations in the form : @xmath54+@xmath55 .",
    "the best - fit parameters and dispersions of the six pl relations for fu and fo cepheids are given in table  [ tab7 ] .",
    "note that the slopes we find are in agreement within 1@xmath41 or better ( see e.g. the @xmath2 band pl ) with the ones from theoretical predictions listed in table  [ tab2_bis ] .",
    "moreover , we also list the pl relations obtained by adopting the extinction values by h11 for @xmath91,120 fu and @xmath9 780 cepheids .",
    "the slopes found with the two different values of the reddening agree inside the error - bar given by the scatter of the relation .",
    "however , the dispersion around the optical pl relations obtained by using the h11 correction are a factor 1.5 ( @xmath0 ) and 2.5 ( @xmath1 ) larger than the ones found by using our new correction .",
    "this finding further supports the high accuracy of our new reddening map for the lmc disk .",
    "moreover , the slopes of the @xmath2,@xmath3 and @xmath4 pl relations are in excellent agreement with the ones found by p04 , who adopted the reddening computed for 51 cepheids by @xcite , and with the ones by @xcite , who used instead a completely independent approach based on the baade - wesselink method .    . the dispersion around each of this relation ranges between 0.09 mag ( @xmath1-band ) to 0.17 mag ( @xmath5-band ) , which is a factor 65%(@xmath1-band)10(@xmath4-band)% smaller than the dispersion when no reddening correction is applied ( see table  [ tab7 ] )",
    "the pl have been arbitrarily shifted in integer magnitude steps to improve the clarity of the figure ( see annotations ) .",
    "]    finally , the new slopes are also in excellent agreement with the ones found by @xcite by adopting the reddening corrections by h11 .",
    "in fact , the agreement is at @xmath160 level for our relations estimated by using the reddening corrections by h11 , and at @xmath128 level when using our new reddening corrections .",
    "we collected the largest ( @xmath9  4,000 ) sample of optical - nir - mir measurements for lmc cepheids .",
    "the use of multi - wavelength observations and of accurate nir templates , allowed us to determine 3%(optical ) 15%(nir ) precise individual distances for the entire sample of cepheids .",
    "moreover , we adopted theoretical predictions based on up - to - date pulsation models to quantify possible systematic errors on individual cepheid distances .",
    "we found that individual distances based on optical pw relations are more affected by systematics ( uncertainty on the adopted reddening law , intrinsic dispersion ) , when compared with distances based on nir pw relations . using the predicted intrinsic dispersion for the pw@xmath50 relation ( @xmath90.06 mag )",
    ", we found that individual distances _ only _ based on optical mean magnitudes can not have an accuracy better than 7% . on the other hand ,",
    "the simultaneous use of the three nir bands : @xmath2,@xmath3 and @xmath4 , allow us to nail down the systematics and to provide individual distances with an accuracy better than 1.5 % .",
    "however , the uncertainty on the w@xmath49 mean magnitudes due to the photometric errors ( @xmath1610.050.15 mag ) on single observations effectively limits the above accuracy , for some samples , to 15% .",
    "the error budget on individual cepheid distances , when moving from optical to nir bands is dominated by different uncertainties ( systematics vs measurement errors ) .",
    "this gives us the unique opportunity to internally validate distances together with their errors and reddening .",
    "our main results are summarised in the following .    @xmath162_viewing angles ",
    "_ we find that the disk of the lmc is oriented with an inclination of @xmath163  ( stat . )",
    "@xmath164  ( syst . )  deg and a position angle of p.a.=150.76@xmath70.02  ( stat . )",
    "@xmath7 0.07  ( syst . ) .",
    "these values are in excellent agreement with recent estimates based on stellar tracers of similar age ( rsg stars , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , previous investigations based on cepheids found larger inclinations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* p04 ) and smaller position angles ( * ? ? ?",
    "the difference is caused by the different spatial distribution of the adopted cepheid samples .",
    "the lmc viewing angles depend , due to its non - axisymmetric shape , on the sky coverage of the adopted stellar tracers .",
    "moreover , the dependence of the inclination on the distance from the center of the distribution is mainly due to a limited mapping of the disk . using cepheids that are only located in the central fields , i.e. , the lmc bar according to the definition by @xcite",
    ", we found @xmath165 .",
    "note that the error reported here and in the following is the difference between the angles found by adopting the pw@xmath50 and the pw@xmath49 relations .",
    "if we extend the region covered by cepheids towards the western part , i.e. , till the edge of the north - western arm , we found @xmath166 , which is very close to the values found by @xcite and by @xcite .    if we exclude the cepheids located across the bar , the inclination is @xmath924@xmath21.2 , thus perfectly consistent with what we have already found using the entire sample .",
    "this finding further supports the evidence that the current cepheid sample allow us to precisely determine its geometry , since it traces the whole lmc disk , i.e. , the bar plus the spiral arms .",
    "there is mounting empirical evidence that stellar tracers ranging from old , low - mass ( rr lyraes ) to intermediate - mass ( planetary nebulae , red clump , agb ) stars and evolved young massive stars ( rsgs ) do provide different viewing angles .",
    "the difference between old and young stellar tracers indicate that the former one is slightly less inclined by @xmath167 and has a position angle @xmath168 degree larger than those based on cepheids .",
    "the above evidence needs to be supported by radial velocity measurements for large samples of the quoted stellar tracers .",
    "a few years ago , @xcite using accurate individual distances of 43 lmc rr lyrae based on the k - band pl relations and kinematic measurements , proposed the possible existence of a dynamically hot spherical halo surrounding the lmc .",
    "however , subsequent estimates based on star counts covering a broader area up to 20@xmath21 from the lmc center @xcite and on rg kinematics @xcite did not support this finding .",
    "the possible occurrence of an extended disk is also still controversial @xcite . the same outcome applies to the possible occurrence of metallicity gradients among the individual stellar components .",
    "the possible occurrence of radial gradients in the metallicity distribution appears even more promising , since it will allow us to couple the different star formation events with their own chemical enrichments and their radial migrations .",
    "the mcs play in this context a crucial role , since the difference in radial distance among the different stellar tracers is negligible .",
    "@xmath162_distance to the lmc _ taking advantage of the multi - band ( optical - nir - mir ) data - set , we adopted the reddening - law fitting method @xcite to determine simultaneously the true distance modulus and the reddening of the entire cepheid sample .",
    "we take account for both estimate and systematic error on individual distance moduli and we found that the final error ranges from 0.1% to 0.7% .",
    "we computed the lmc distance distribution and we found that the median is @xmath142 mag using both fundamental and first overtone cepheids .",
    "the above error , estimated as the standard deviation around the median , accounts for both statistical and systematic effects , but neglects the error on the zero - point of the photometric calibration ( @xmath90.02 mag ) .",
    "the excellent agreement on the distance based on fundamental and first overtone cepheids further supports the use of fo cepheids as solid distance indicators @xcite .",
    "moreover , our estimate of the mean distance to the lmc is also in excellent agreement with similar estimates , but based on a smaller cepheid sample @xcite , and with the geometrical distance obtained by @xcite on the basis of eclipsing binary systems .",
    "@xmath162_reddening towards the lmc disk  _",
    "the reddening - law fitting method provides individual reddening estimates for each cepheid in our sample , with an accuracy better than 20% .",
    "we compared the current reddening values with those available in the literature and we found that the current reddening map agrees quite well with the one provided by @xcite using rc stars , but it is one order of magnitude more accurate and a factor of two larger .",
    "we provide the entire cepheid catalog with mean nir and mir magnitudes , together with the individual distances and extinction values .",
    "we demonstrated that the use of nir pw relations to determine cepheids individual distances is extremely promising .",
    "however , nir surveys towards the lmc with modest photometric precision ( @xmath1610.050.15 mag , on single observations ) do not allow us to fully exploit the intrinsic accuracy of nir distance diagnostics . however , accurate nir templates allow us to use highly - accurate single - epoch photometric measurements available in the literature to match the precision typical of distance determinations based on optical bands .",
    "the current approach based on measurements ranging from optical to mid - infrared observations of classical cepheids , appears very promising for accurate individual distance determinations and paves the way to accurate estimates of their intrinsic properties as a function of the radial distribution .",
    "we will complement the accurate information on the three - dimensional distribution presented here with individual radial velocities and chemical abundances for a significant fraction of the cepheids in our sample .",
    "the kinematic and the chemical tagging of a significant fraction of lmc cepheids will allow us to further constrain the physical proprieties of the young stellar population in the lmc disk .",
