    "while numerous advances have been made in the study of dilute atomic gases at ultracold temperatures , very little is yet known about ultracold molecular gases , particularly for strongly polar molecules .",
    "the first experiments with ensembles of trapped polar molecules are only recently reported  @xcite .",
    "molecular gases are more difficult to cool than their atomic counterparts , and the temperatures at which effects of quantum degeneracy are apparent are typically much lower . improved cooling and trapping techniques for cold molecules",
    "have emerged , including the development of decelerators  @xcite and the formation of molecules from ultracold atoms via photoassociation  @xcite . but most trapped molecular ensembles are still relatively `` hot '' and rather far from the quantum degenerate regime .",
    "many theoretical studies of molecular collisions at cold and ultracold temperatures are now emerging in order to spur and assist these ongoing experimental efforts  @xcite .",
    "one of the most striking outcomes of recent studies is the identification of large elastic scattering resonances in zero - energy collisions of virtually all molecules aligned in an external electric field  @xcite .",
    "these resonances can be `` tuned '' with the electric field strength , resulting in a novel kind of zero - energy spectroscopy  @xcite , and they have also been predicted in calculations of trapped ensembles  @xcite . in an earlier work , we demonstrated the universality of these resonances for bosonic collision partners  @xcite . in this paper , we provide a number of details of the resonance classification , and extend the work by comparing and contrasting with similar resonances in collisions between fermionic polar molecules .",
    "a few general observations highlight the importance that resonance formation and decay will play in the dynamics of ultracold molecular gases : 1 ) near - threshold collisions of polar molecules are `` resonance rich '' , with resonances of shape , feshbach / fano and mixed characteristics forming in the long - range dipole - dipole field , and with detailed characteristics sensitive to shorter ranged interactions ; 2 ) the resonances occur systematically and can readily be predicted by simple semi - classical quantization formulas ; 3 ) the character and frequency of resonances differ distinctly between bose and fermi collision partners ; 4 ) the angular distribution of scattered products in near - zero energy collisions is strongly correlated with resonance formation and decay ; and 5 ) the resonances are universal and , with minor field variations , can be realized in virtually all strongly polar molecules .",
    "this ubiquity of threshold resonance phenomena implies that complex few and many - body processes in ultracold polar gases are likely to emerge as experiments progress to the quantum - degenerate regime .",
    "there are many molecules ( such as alkali - halide salts ) which , in their lowest energy states , exhibit strong polar characteristics .",
    "however , in the absence of external fields , as a consequence of parity conservation , even these strongly `` polar '' molecules have zero dipole moment .",
    "molecular interactions may polarize such collision partners , even in the absence of any external fields , though this generally produces a relatively benign and isotropic ( @xmath0 ) van der waals attraction at large intermolecular separations .",
    "the stronger ( @xmath1 ) anisotropic interactions of interest here require the imposition of an external electric field , @xmath2 , coupling opposite parity states , and producing a generally field - dependent dipole moment @xmath3 for all molecules .",
    "the magnitude and sign of the `` induced '' dipole moment , @xmath4 , therefore depends on specific details of the @xmath5 stark shift of the state of interest for any particular molecule  @xcite . in general , for zero field , two molecular states of opposite parity are separated by an energy gap , so that @xmath5 varies quadratically for small fields . at larger fields ,",
    "stark maps tend to a linear regime , yielding a maximal induced dipole moment @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is some effective charge , and @xmath8 is a measure of the charge separation along the field axis , and typically is a few bohr in size .",
    "the magnitude of the electric field required to maximize the dipole moment @xmath4 depends principally on the size of the zero - field energy gap ; molecules with ground @xmath9 states tend to have relatively large gaps and often require experimentally unrealistic field strengths , while those in @xmath10 or @xmath11 states can have quite small gaps ( owing to the phenomenon of @xmath12-doubling ) , producing maximal dipole moments with modest fields .    for ground vibrational states of @xmath9 molecules @xmath13 can be estimated as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the rotational constant of the molecule and @xmath16 is the field direction . in table",

    "@xmath18 stands for @xmath19 .",
    "the dipole length , @xmath20 is calculated in the assumption that the molecule is completely polarized . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the nature of these variations can be understood better after a closer look at fig .",

    "each of the adiabatic channels has a strong short - range attractive core which can support many bound states . when varying the short - range boundary conditions we effectively vary the number of bound states supported by each of the potentials . each time one of the adiabatic potentials",
    "looses a threshold bound state we see a strong variation in the total cross section .",
    "figure 2 therefore illustrates four distinct cases , depending on the presence of a near - threshold bound state and the system parity .",
    "the effect of a near - threshold resonance on the cross section energy dependence is different for bosons and fermions .",
    "even though the threshold bound state strongly influences the magnitude of the cross section in the bosonic case , the energy dependence of the cross section remains qualitatively the same ( fig  [ fig : csenergydep]a , c ) . in the case of fermions",
    ", however , there is a striking difference between resonant and off - resonant cases ( fig  [ fig : csenergydep]b , d ) : the shape resonance formed in the lowest adiabatic potential is narrow enough to produce a rapid variation of the cross section . in the non - resonant fermionic case ( fig  [ fig : csenergydep]b ) , when the collision energy approaches the barrier top of @xmath21d.u .",
    "the scattering cross section also grows , although not producing as distinctive a feature as in the resonant scenario ( fig  [ fig : csenergydep]d ) .",
    "while bosonic threshold bound states produce a cross section enhancement in a broad range of the cut - off radii @xmath22 , fermionic cross sections are strongly enhanced only in very close vicinity of the resonant conditions ( i.e. the resonances are clearly narrower ) .    the influence of the short - range cut - off radius on the resonances formation can be understood from simple semiclassical analysis , as discussed below .",

    "[ fig:3]a ) .",
    "consider the positions of wide peaks corresponding to a near - threshold bound state forming in the lowest adiabatic channel .",
    "such bound states exist if the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition ( at @xmath24 ) is satisfied @xmath25 although the semiclassical condition is not strictly applicable to the calculation of the position of the rightmost peak in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]a ( since the right turning point in the @xmath26 channel effectively lies at @xmath27 ) , we have introduced a single fitting parameter @xmath28 in order to reproduce the position of the rightmost peak correctly .",
    "fitting the potential @xmath26 as @xmath29 we get an explicit expression for the values of @xmath30 that support a near - threshold bound state @xmath31 the universal dimensionless parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 are obtained from fitting the adiabatic potential curve , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : swaveres ] ) then gives the positions of the peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]a up to 3 significant figures .    similarly , the semiclassical description is useful for understanding positions of other resonances that occur in higher adiabatic channels .",
    "all the resonances in the model system can be classified according to the asymptotic behaviour of the effective potential that produces the resonance , i.e. the corresponding @xmath23 quantum numbers , and the number of bound states supported by the corresponding channel potential . if nonadiabatic coupling could be neglected , the resonances would have zero - width when approaching threshold because of the large dipole - modified centrifugal barrier in fig .  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "in fact , they dominantly decay into the lowest @xmath34 adiabatic channel through short - range nonadiabatic coupling and show up as feshbach resonances in the total elastic cross section .",
    "their positions can be found directly from the usual bohr - sommerfeld quantization procedure with no fitting parameters . although it is more difficult to develop a simple fit to the higher adiabatic potentials , an expression similar to ( [ eq : swaveres ] ) provides an excellent fit to the positions of the other resonances obtained from analyzing the semiclassical picture numerically @xmath35 we have performed such fitting for the dominant channels contributing to the low - energy scattering and the results are presented in table  [ tab : resparam ] .",

    "unlike central potentials , the threshold scattering of dipoles can be strongly anisotropic even in the case of identical bosons . although the @xmath39 channel strongly dominates scattering at low energies , the degree of this domination depends on short - range boundary conditions .",

    "<S> elastic scattering resonances occurring in ultracold collisions of either bosonic or fermionic polar molecules are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the born - oppenheimer adiabatic representation of the two - body dynamics provides both a qualitative classification scheme and a quantitative wkb quantization condition that predicts several sequences of resonant states . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the near - threshold energy dependence of ultracold collision cross sections varies significantly with the particle exchange symmetry , with bosonic systems showing much smoother energy variations than their fermionic counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> resonant variations of the angular distributions in ultracold collisions are also described .    </S>",
    "<S> _ keywords _ : dipoles , low - energy scattering , resonances </S>"
