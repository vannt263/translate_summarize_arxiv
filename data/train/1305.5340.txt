    "the concept of complex spectra was introduced as a contrast to simple spectra , for which the formation of series is the most conspicuous feature , see ref .",
    "complex spectra are characterized by the appearance of multiplets or groups of lines with characteristic spacings and strengths .",
    "kuhn assigned them to atoms or ions having more than one valence electron ( or hole ) with @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "another distinction between simple and complex spectra , based on the richness in lines and the efforts in unravelling the spectra , was given by racah at the rydberg centennial conference in lund in 1954 :  the atomic spectra can be divided in three classes :    \\(i ) spectra where a @xmath5-subshell is filling up , which may be considered as simple spectra ,    \\(ii ) spectra where a @xmath6-subshell is filling up , which are considered as complex spectra and    \\(iii ) spectra , where a @xmath7-subshell is filling up , which are so complex that most of them have not been analyzed at all  @xcite .    concerning point ( iii ) ,",
    "things have changed since then , of course : the analysis of the @xmath8-elements ( lanthanides or rare earths ) improved in the seventies due to better experimental and theoretical tools . in his paper",
    "entitled `` complex atomic spectra '' , judd @xcite gives an extensive review of the theoretical treatment of complex atoms and a detailed list of all systems of configurations that had been studied before 1985 .",
    "judd also points out the difference between the definition of complex spectra based on the atomic structure and the `` common misconception '' that complex has to do with the complicated line spectrum caused by , _",
    "e.g. _ overlapping multiplets .",
    "one possible way to define the difference between simple and complex spectra could involve the series limits .",
    "the basic term system in simple spectra has only one series limit , whereas complex spectra have multiple series limits .",
    "this distinction is very close to the one given by kuhn , while we find both simple and complex spectra in all three classes discussed by racah .",
    "simple spectra have one common convergence point , the ionization limit , which can be determined by extrapolating regular rydberg series .",
    "the multiple series limits in complex spectra are due to a set of @xmath9 terms that may even belong to more than one configuration .",
    "thus , a distinction between simple and complex spectra based on the number of series limits includes the structure of the atomic core , which to a great extent determines the structure of the atom itself .",
    "a large number of valence electrons and the competition in binding energy between @xmath6 and @xmath10 electrons give rise to a multitude of closely spaced core terms , which act as multiple series limits .",
    "the link between the distribution of spectral lines and quantum chaos was studied in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite . as long as @xmath11 and @xmath12 remain good quantum numbers , the independent - particle model and the central field approximation both apply , and quantum chaos does not arise .",
    "there are two situations where chaos can emerge : the complete breakdown of the independent electron approximation ( due , for example , to strong correlations ) and a distortion of the central field approximation , due , for instance , to a strong external field .",
    "however , the role of chaos in the spectroscopy of highly excited atoms should not be overstated . due to the pauli principle",
    ", the shell structure of atoms restores spherical symmetry to the many - electron atom at each new row of the periodic table , and spherical symmetry , which helps the independent particle model , inhibits chaos @xcite .",
    "in addition , as the excitation energy increases , auto - ionization and auger effects limit the emergence of chaos , because the lifetimes are so short that instabilities in the underlying dynamics do not have time to develop .",
    "situations favourable to the emergence of chaos are those in which a dense manifold of rydberg states is subject to perturbations with a strength comparable to the level spacing .",
    "this constitutes the major difference between chaos and complexity ; in some situations the levels do not interact , but are simply very numerous , which makes their analysis impossible in practice although possible in principle .",
    "transition arrays can be described by the uta ( unresolved transition arrays ) formalism @xcite , which enables one to calculate the first two strength - weighted moments of the distribution of the lines .",
    "such an approach is useful for the interpretation of spectra , but is not related to the problem of quantum chaos .",
    "cowan compared the term analysis of a spectrum with `` the problem of trying to put together the pieces of a complicated jigsaw puzzle when the pieces never fit exactly , some pieces fit spuriously , some critical pieces are missing and there are pieces present that belong to one or more entirely different puzzles '' @xcite .",
    "for that reason , identifying regularities and trends is important for the development of approximate statistical models required in complex spectra due to the huge number of energy levels and electric - dipole lines . thus , the uncovered regularities and trends enable one to evaluate the reliability of theoretical predictions as well as experimental determinations , and open the way to a better understanding of the underlying physical processes .",
    "for instance , let us consider transitions for which principal and orbital ( azimuthal ) quantum numbers of the upper and lower states are simultaneously changed by unity , _ i.e. _ transitions of the kind @xmath13 with @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( for instance @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) .",
    "the hydrogenic expression of the oscillator strength ( gordon s formula ) reads @xcite :    @xmath20    and follows , for large values of @xmath11 , a linear variation    @xmath21    the knowledge of such asymptotic behaviour can be useful when preparing experiments .    in this work",
    ", we will first try to explain the fractal nature of some atomic spectra and the importance of scale invariance through learner s logarithmic rule ( in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] ) and the law of anomalous numbers for digits of line strengths ( see sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] ) .",
    "those first two points are not fully understood yet . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , the concept of propensity rule is presented and the possible occurrence of `` blue wings '' in the vicinity of particle - hole coupling is discussed in sec .",
    "such tendencies can be understood thanks to the selection rules . in sec .",
    "6 we discuss the symmetry with respect to the quarter of the subshell , which was discovered for the ratio of the intensities of the strongest lines emitted by lanthanide elements in calibrated arcs .",
    "such a symmetry property gives the possibility to interpolate the experimental values more accurately .",
    "the studies of hot plasmas have shown the efficiency of the statistical approaches to complex atomic spectra .",
    "for instance , approximate formulas have been derived for the distribution of the values of the total angular momentum @xmath22 in an electronic configuration . however , the existing formulae overlook the fluctuations .",
    "one particular fluctuation is the asymmetry in the parity of the @xmath22 values : there are more even @xmath22 values than odd ones .",
    "we finish therefore , in sec .",
    "[ sec7 ] , with a study of the odd - even staggering in the distribution of total angular momentum @xmath22 .",
    "we show that the excess obtained by bauche and coss can be obtained in a straightforward and elegant way by generating functions .",
    "thirty years ago , learner found what he called an `` unexpected law '' related to the number of weak lines in a spectrum @xcite .",
    "he measured a large number of line intensities in the atomic spectrum of iron , over a dynamic range of 1000 and emphasized the existence of a remarkable power law for the density of lines versus their intensity : the logarithm @xmath23 of the number of lines whose intensities lie between @xmath24 and @xmath25 is a decreasing linear function of @xmath11 :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the total number of lines and @xmath5 the slope . in learner",

    "regularities and tendencies are not exact features , but are often the visible part of exact symmetries . the symmetry with respect to a quarter of the subshell was discovered for the ratio of line intensities of the strongest lines emitted by lanthanides in calibrated arcs .",

    "statistical methods appear to be very useful for the modeling of complex atomic spectra .",
    "indeed , approximate formulas have been derived for the values of the total atomic number @xmath22 in an electronic configuration , and for the number of electric - dipole lines in an atomic transition array .",
    "these problems have been solved exactly , by tedious explicit level - by - level methods @xcite , but no general formula exists .",
    "in addition , no fluctuations _",
    "i.e. _ , deviations of the exact results from the statistical formulae , have yet been characterized .",
    "actually , one type of fluctuation is the predominance of the levels with even @xmath22 values . studying the statistics of @xmath78 values",
    "consists in classifying the slater determinants according to their values of @xmath78 .",
    "although the total number of determinants is equal to a simple combinatorial factor , no compact formula is yet known for the number of determinants relative to a given @xmath78 value .",
    "let us consider a system of @xmath72 identical fermions in a configuration consisting of a single orbital of degeneracy @xmath79 , @xmath80 being the angular momentum projection of electron state @xmath81 .",

    "a multifractal represents a set of elementary fractals that are organized by means of some measure , which characterizes the density of the physical quantity on its geometrical carrier .",
