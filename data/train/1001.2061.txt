    "the propagation of light in anisotropic media is still receiving a good deal of attention from both the experimental and the theoretical points of view .",
    "the subject is of fundamental interest because of its important role in polarizers , compensators , amplitude- and phase - modulation devices , also , in nonlinear optical phenomena which usually take place in anisotropic media .",
    "an accurate electromagnetic description is required for the evaluation of the field distribution in , for example , designing polarizers and compensators or in describing the nonlinear processes like second harmonic generation .",
    "a number of studies  @xcite have been devoted to an analysis of optical beam propagation in anisotropic medium , but most of them are concerned about the uniaxial cases .",
    "for instance , fleck _ et al . _",
    "@xcite derived the paraxial equations for both the ordinary and the extraordinary components of the field in uniform uniaxial anisotropic media .",
    "the derivation is based on the paraxial approximation that the electric field corresponding to the beam is plane polarized with a polarization corresponding to either an ordinary or an extraordinary wave .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a theoretical scheme that the exact plane wave angular spectrum representation is approximated within the paraxial constraint , obtaining the paraxial expressions for the ordinary and extraordinary components of a field propagating in uniaxial media .",
    "@xcite considered the propagation of light pulses in anisotropic and dispersive media , deriving the equation for the slowly varying envelope of the electric field .",
    "the equation has applications in divers fields . in their paper , it was used to investigate the propagation of an optical pulse in uniaxial media , and found that the equation contains terms that rotate the pulse in time domain . the rotation effect that originate because of the anisotropy of the medium and the finite size of the field .",
    "the similar effect in spatial domain can be found in the beam propagation in anisotropic media , however , it remains undiscussed .",
    "generally speaking , investigation of optical beam propagation in biaxial media is more complicated than that in uniaxial media because of the lower symmetry in the dielectric tensor of the former . to our knowledge , the first attempt to quantify the propagation of beam in biaxial media was made by dreger @xcite . in his paper , he derived the optical beam propagators for biaxial media and specialized them for three cases of wave - vector direction : general directions , coincident with an optic axis , and nearly parallel to an optic axis .",
    "his derivation refers to complicated mathematical analysis . in our paper",
    ", we will give another way of deriving the wave equation for paraxial beam propagating in the general directions .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in section 2 , we use the method that has been introduced in @xcite to obtain the eigenmode solution in biaxial media .",
    "this method is well known , but to our knowledge , the results for biaxial media are unavailable in the literatures published so far . in section 3",
    "we derive the equation for the optical beam in anisotropic media .",
    "previously , qi guo and sien chi @xcite have derived the nonlinear paraxial wave equation for the propagation of an optical beam in anisotropic media . because the nonlinear effect are treated as a small perturbation , the whole derivation is available for the linear situation if the nonlinear term is not considered .",
    "besides , we find that there is an improper approximation in the process of the derivation . in this section , therefore , we adopt their way to derive the beam equation and make an improvement in the derivation . in section 4",
    "we illustrate the dynamics of the beam propagation by using initial elliptical gaussian beams .",

    "[ 2beamscompare](a ) together with ( b ) shows that before the @xmath121 term makes an obvious rotation on the cross - section of the beam ( for example , @xmath240 ) , @xmath195 has dramatically decreased and approached the minimum value , i.e. the ellipticity decreases .",
    "this is because the diffraction will exercise the most influence on the evolution of the beam rather than the rotation effect if the coefficient @xmath121 is much smaller than @xmath119 ( or @xmath120 ) .",
    "although the rotation will become evident with @xmath235 increasing , the initial rotation effect is strongly influenced by diffraction and is barely visible ( like the mode 2 beam in fig .",
    "[ 3beams](a ) and ( b ) ) . as a result ,",
    "in our examples we choose the spacial widths of the initial field ( @xmath177 and @xmath178 ) to be close to each other so that the diffraction effect is not so strong to influence the observation of the rotation . the process of beam rotation shown in fig .",
    "[ 3beams ] may be not so obvious , but we think the examples are sufficient to elucidate the physics .    an obvious beam rotation can be observed if coefficient @xmath121 is comparable to @xmath119 or @xmath120 in magnitude",
    "in order to find a large @xmath121 , we examine the ratio @xmath241 ( @xmath120 is on the order of @xmath119 ) . the ratio is a function of the the euler angles with the maximum determined by @xmath242 $ ] which is associated with the degree of anisotropy . according to this value",
    ", we find that in many natural biaxial crystals like @xmath243 , @xmath244 or @xmath245 @xcite , @xmath121 is at least one order less than @xmath119 . to our knowledge , natural material with large @xmath121 is not readily available yet .",
    "however , in recent scientific progress , metamaterial technology revolutionized modern optics and photonics by creating nearly unlimited opportunities for engineering material parameters .",
    "the electric and magnetic properties can be carefully designed and tuned by changing the geometry , size and other characteristics of meta - atoms @xcite .",
    "as a result , material with large coefficient @xmath121 might be realized .",
    "for example , supposed that a kind of metamaterial with a dielectric tenser @xmath246\\ ] ] has been engineered , according to our theory above , in the supposed propagation direction , we have @xmath247 , @xmath248 and @xmath249 for the mode 1 beam ( @xmath140 is chosen to be equal to@xmath250 ) . since @xmath121 is comparable to @xmath251 , we can expect a significant effect from @xmath121 .",
    "we present the propagation of the mode 1 beam in such material in fig .",
    "[ beaminmeta ] .",
    "as expected , the inclination is obvious .    through these examples",
    ", we can see that the coefficient @xmath121 will play an rotation effect on the beam propagation if it is nonvanishing .",
    "although here we just present the propagation of elliptical gaussian beam , many other simulations can be made with the beam equation in biaxial media or uniaxial media , for example , the propagation of higher - order modes of hermit - gaussian beams , we do nt present the results here .",
    "we investigate the propagation of paraxial beam in anisotropic media .",
    "the propagation equation contains terms that account for the beam walk - off , fresnel diffraction and beam rotation which is mainly discussed in this paper .",
    "the term responsible for the rotation originates from the finite beam size and the refractive index depending on the propagation direction . as a result , this term vanishes for the wave in isotropic media and for the ordinary wave in uniaxial media ; it is nonvanishing for the extraordinary wave in uniaxial media and the waves in biaxial media .",
    "we investigate this rotation effect by using an initial elliptical gaussian beam in the biaxial media @xmath210 .",
    "the analytical solution shows that the initial elliptical cross - section of the beam keeps elliptical and rotates clockwise or counterclockwise during propagation , and for large propagation distance , the rotation angle will asymptotically approach a certain value which depends on the ratio of the initial beam widths .",
    "it also shows that an initial circular gaussian beam will lose its circular symmetry and become elliptical and inclined .",
    "this is because the anisotropy makes the properties of diffractive spreading different in every transverse directions .",
    "finally , we point out that the intensity of the rotation is associated with the degree of anisotropy",
    ". the rotation will be remarkable with high degree of anisotropy of the media , otherwise , it will be week and may be covered by diffraction .",
