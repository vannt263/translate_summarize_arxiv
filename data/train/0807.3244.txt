    "it is well established that nucleons have a rich excitation spectrum which reflects their complicated multi - quark inner dynamics .",
    "the determination of properties of the nucleon resonances ( e.g. , their masses , widths , and coupling constants to various decay channels ) is an important issue of the hadron physics .",
    "this will provide the benchmark for testing the predictions of the lattice quantum chromodynamics ( lqcd ) which is the only theory which tries to calculate these properties from the first principles  @xcite . even though , the requirement of the computational power is enormous for their numerical realization ,",
    "such calculations have started to provide results for properties of ground as well as excited states of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , reliable nucleon resonance data are also important for testing the `` quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) based '' quark models of the nucleon ( see , e.g. @xcite ) and also the dynamical coupled - channels models of baryonic resonances  @xcite .",
    "experimental determination of baryonic resonance properties proceeds indirectly by exciting the nucleon with the help of a hadronic or electromagnetic probe and performing measurements of their decay products ( mesons and nucleons ) .",
    "the reliable extraction of nucleon resonance properties from such experiments is a major challenge . as description of the intermediate energy scattering",
    "is still far away from the scope of the lqcd calculations , the prevailing practice as of now , is to use effective methods to describe the dynamics of the meson production reactions .",
    "such methods explicitly include baryon resonance states , whose properties are extracted by matching predictions of the theory with the experimental data .",
    "the ultimate goal is to compare the values extracted in this way with those predicted by the lqcd calculations .    in this lecture",
    "we review one such method which is based on an effective lagrangian model  @xcite , in the context of @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson ( to be referred collectively as @xmath5 in the following ) productions in elementary nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath6 ) collisions . in this model contributions to the amplitudes are taken into account by lowest order feynman diagrams ( tree - level ) which are generated by effective lagrangians that satisfy the relevant conservation laws and are consistent with the basic symmetry ( chiral ) of the fundamental theory , namely , the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "these lagrangians involve baryons and mesons as effective degrees of freedom instead of quarks and gluons .",
    "recently , there has been a lot of interest in studying the production of @xmath5 mesons ( which are the next lightest nonstrange members in the meson mass spectrum ) in @xmath6 collisions and the corresponding data base has enhanced considerably ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "these reactions are expected to provide information on the manifestation of the qcd in the non - perturbative regime of energies larger than that of the pion physics where concepts like the low energy theorem and partial conservation of axial current ( pcac ) provide a useful insight into the relevant physics  @xcite .",
    "the strangeness quantum number introduced by these reactions leads to new degrees of freedom into this domain which brings in new symmetries and conservation laws .",
    "they are expected to probe the admixture of @xmath7 pairs in the nucleon wave function  @xcite and the baryon - nucleon and @xmath5-nucleon interactions @xcite .",
    "the elementary @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is a nucleon or hyperon ) cross sections are one of the most crucial ingredients in the transport model studies of the @xmath5-meson production in the nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "they provide the opportunity to study the equation - of - state of the baryonic matter at high density  @xcite and in - medium modifications of strongly interacting particles which might be related to the chiral symmetry restoration @xcite .",
    "these are the fundamental aspects of nuclear and hadron physics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the enhancement of the open strangeness production has been proposed as a signature for the formation of quark - gluon plasma in high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions  @xcite .",
    "the elementary production reactions often provide important means for studying the properties of the nucleon resonances .",
    "for example , the spin-@xmath10 , isospin-@xmath10 , and odd parity nucleon resonance @xmath11(1535 ) [ @xmath12 has a remarkably large @xmath13 branching ratio .",
    "it lies very close to the threshold of the @xmath14 reaction and contributes to the amplitude of this reaction even at the threshold .",
    "therefore , the study of @xmath1 meson production in @xmath6 collisions at near threshold beam energies provides the unique opportunity to investigate the properties of @xmath11(1535 ) which have been the subject of some debate recently ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the understanding of the elementary kaon production reactions is a doorway to the theoretical investigation of the production of hypernuclei in reactions like @xmath15 where the hypernucleus @xmath16 has the same neutron and proton numbers as the target nucleus @xmath17 , with one hyperon added .",
    "moreover , the attractive nature of the @xmath1-nucleon interaction may lead to the formation of bound ( quasi - bound ) @xmath1-nucleus states ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this subject has been a topic of great interest recently .",
    "the formation of @xmath1 mesic nuclei depend critically on the value of @xmath13 scattering length ( @xmath18 ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath1 meson production in @xmath6 collisions near threshold energies provides vital information about @xmath18 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     in fig .  3",
    ", we present comparisons of our calculations with the experimental data for total cross sections of @xmath19 and @xmath20 reactions as a function of @xmath21 . for both reactions the fsi effects are important at these low beam energies . while , for the @xmath20 reaction our model is able to describe the data well for the entire range of beam energies , for the @xmath19 reaction data are reproduced only for @xmath21 values in the range of 15 - 130 mev .",
    "however , for the later case , an important result is that the fsi in the @xmath22 sub - state is indeed quite important in our model .",
    "yet it is not enough to explain the data for @xmath23 15 mev .",
    "underpredition of the data by theory for these values of @xmath24 , has also been seen in calculations presented in refs .",
    ".    there may be several reasons for this underprediction .",
    "@xmath22 final state interaction may have a different form for these low energy which could make it relatively stronger in this region .",
    "we noted that taking larger values for the scattering lengths @xmath18 worsens the fit to the data for @xmath25 15 mev .",
    "in fact , best description of the data is provided by the @xmath13 scattering amplitudes corresponding to @xmath26 . although , the real part of this @xmath18 is about half of that of the `` preferred '' @xmath27 parameter set of ref .",
    "@xcite , yet a smaller @xmath18 is consistent with that extracted by several authors @xcite from studies involving meson - nucleon scattering . on the other hand , calculations of fsi effects within the three - body scattering theory of faddeev type  @xcite",
    "seem to reproduce the data for @xmath23 15 mev .",
    "however , predictions of this theory for @xmath25 60 mev is not known .",
    "the born term ( nucleon intermediate states ) is conjectured to contribute strongly at lower energies . to check this point we present in fig",
    ".  4 results of our full calculations with born term included .",
    "we see that the inclusion of the amplitudes corresponding to the nucleon intermediate states , makes negligible difference to the results shown in fig .  3 if the value of the coupling constant @xmath28 is below 3.0 . using the largest considered value of for @xmath28 ( 6.14 ) ,",
    "the results are affected to the extent of only a few percent . obviously , due to considerable amount of uncertainty in the value of @xmath28 , the nucleon excitation amplitudes are quite uncertain and their inclusion makes no significant difference in the results reported in fig .",
    "in particular , the discrepancy between theory and the data for @xmath29 mev remains unresolved .",
    "recently , it has been shown  @xcite that the description of the @xmath19 data can be improved considerably for lower values of @xmath21 within a resonance model by including @xmath30 resonance with unusually large couplings constants for for @xmath31 and @xmath32 vertices . in this context",
    "one should note that coupling constants extracted in the effective lagrangian coupled - channels analysis  @xcite of @xmath33 and @xmath34 reactions are about an order of magnitude smaller than those used in ref .",
    "we believe that explanation of the @xmath35 data for beam energies very close to the threshold is still an open issue .",
    "the production of light hyperons in proton - proton collisions has been extensively studied at close - to - threshold beam energies .",
    "the energy dependence of the experimental total cross sections of @xmath20 and @xmath36 reactions has been well reproduced within the effective lagrangian model ( see , last of ref .",
    "very recently , data have become available also for the @xmath37 reaction .",
    "the interest in the @xmath38 production channel stems from the fact that it provides a sensitive tool to search for a possible penta quark state .",
    "cosy-11 and cosy - anke collaborations have reported quite contrasting values for this reaction at excess energies of 13 mev and 60 mev  @xcite , and 129 mev  @xcite , respectively .    in fig .  5",
    ", we compare these data with predictions of our model .",
    "we notice that lower energy data points are surprisingly too high - they are at least an order of magnitude larger than our calculations . on the other hand ,",
    "the higher energy point is smaller than the theoretical results by a factor of about 3 .",
    "two measurements , thus , imply a very large threshold anomaly which must be verified .",
    "it has been suggested that inclusion in production process of the @xmath39 resonance and an unrealistically very strong @xmath40 fsi would allow to achieve a much better agreement ( within factors of 2 - 4 ) with the data at lower energies  @xcite .",
    "however , in this calculation , the coupling constant for the @xmath41 vertex is very uncertain .",
    "while there is no creditable evidence for the decay of @xmath39 isobar into the @xmath42 channel , there are branching ratios known ( albeit with large error bars ) for the decay of @xmath43 and @xmath44 isobars into this channel  @xcite .",
    "one should rather include these resonances into the model . in any case , the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite grossly overpredicts the data point at high energy .",
    "the solution of this problem must await the new measurements of this reaction by the cosy - anke group at close - to - threshold energies .",
    "in summary , we presented some application of our effective lagrangian model in understanding the recent data on hidden strangeness production ( @xmath14 ) and open strangeness production ( @xmath20 , @xmath36 , @xmath45 ) reactions in nucleon - nucleon collisions . with the same set of vertex parameters ,",
    "the model is able to provide a good description of the @xmath46 reaction at higher as well as near threshold beam energies except for the excess energies below 15 mev where our calculations underpredict the experimental cross sections .",
    "we examined the validity of several suggestions for understanding this discrepancy .",
    "it turns out that a very strong @xmath13 fsi or the inclusion of the born term is unlikely to explain this anomaly .",
    "inclusion of the @xmath30 resonance with reasonable coupling constants at the vector meson vertices is also unlikely to be of any help .",
    "this at the moment remains an open issue .",
    "this model is able to describe majority of the data on @xmath20 and @xmath36 reactions where it is found that the @xmath11(1650 ) resonant state contributes predominantly to both these reactions at near threshold beam energies .",
    "therefore , the study of these reactions provides an ideal means of investigating the properties of this @xmath47 baryonic resonance . on the other hand ,",
    "calculations are not compatible with the published few data points on @xmath37 reaction .",
    "one has to wait for the results of the new measurements for this reaction by the cosy - anke group at near threshold beam energies .",
    "the author wishes the thank hans strher for several useful conversations on the measurements of the cosy - anke group .",
