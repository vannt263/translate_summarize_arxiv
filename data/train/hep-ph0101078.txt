    "in a series of publications @xcite an ambitious qcd program has been initiated to comprehensively investigate hadron structure .",
    "the theoretical formulation entails renormalization and utilizes established many - body techniques to approximately diagonalize an effective confining hamiltonian .",
    "this paper , a detailed continuation of our recent letter @xcite , focuses upon the quark sector and reports numerical results for mesons complementing our previous gluon study @xcite .    over the years",
    "there have been many meson investigations , from the early , simple non - relativistic constituent quark model calculations to more involved relativistic , field theoretical approaches implementing current quarks and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "a common shortcoming of these analyses is an inability to consistently reproduce the physical mass spectrum of the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "our paper addresses this issue and significantly extends the pioneering work of the orsay group @xcite , adler and davis @xcite , and the lisbon investigators @xcite . in our approach the exact qcd hamiltonian in the coulomb gauge is modeled by an effective , confining hamiltonian , @xmath0 , that is fully relativistic with quark field operators and current quark masses . however , before approximately diagonalizing @xmath0 , a similarity transformation is implemented to a new quasiparticle basis having a dressed , but unknown constituent mass . as described in sec .",
    "ii , this transformation entails a rotation which mixes the bare quark creation and annihilation operators . by then performing a variational calculation to minimize the ground state ( vacuum ) energy , a specific angle and corresponding quasiparticle mass",
    "is selected . in this fashion chiral symmetry",
    "is dynamically broken and a non - trivial vacuum with quark condensates emerges .",
    "this treatment is precisely analogous to the bardeen , cooper , and schrieffer ( bcs ) description of a superconducting metal as a coherent vacuum state of interacting quasiparticles combining to form condensates ( cooper pairs ) .",
    "excited states ( mesons ) can then be represented as quasiparticle excitations using standard many - body techniques which in this work will be the tamm - dancoff ( tda ) and random phase approximation ( rpa ) methods .",
    "the two treatments are truncated at the one quasiparticle , one quasihole level and then numerically compared .",
    "our rpa analysis confirms and extends the early work of ref .",
    "@xcite which utilized an extended nambu - jona - lasinio mean field approach .",
    "two other comments are in order before proceeding .",
    "first , there are several reasons for choosing the coulomb gauge framework .",
    "as discussed by zwanziger @xcite , the hamiltonian is renormalizable in this gauge and , equally as important , the gribov problem ( @xmath6 does not uniquely specify the gauge ) can be resolved ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for further discussion ) .",
    "related , there are no spurious gluon degrees of freedom since only transverse gluons enter .",
    "this ensures all hilbert vectors have positive normalizations which is essential for using variational techniques that have been widely successful in atomic , molecular and condensed matter physics .",
    "second , due to fock space truncations our analysis is not lorentz invariant .",
    "however , we only plan to use one frame and do not compute hadron form factors with this method .",
    "interestingly , violating lorentz non - invariance implies a prefered reference frame , which , as selected by chiral symmetry breaking , is the condensate rest frame .",
    "this paper consists of six sections and two appendices .",
    "the next section introduces our effective , qcd inspired hamiltionian and developes the bcs vacuum treatment leading to the quasiparticle mass gap equation .",
    "we also compare our approach to the classic nambu - jona - lasinio model . in sec .",
    "iii we detail our numerical , supercomputer solution of the gap equation along with the quark condensate and constituent mass values .",
    "sections iv a and iv b describe the tda and rpa , respectively , while sec .",
    "iv c addresses weak decays and sec iv d presents a derivation of the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation .",
    "the tda and rpa meson spectra are compared and discussed in sec .",
    "v. this section also includes results from a simple @xmath7 flavor mixing analysis for the @xmath8-@xmath9 system and our predictions for the charmed mesons .",
    "conclusions and future work are summarized in sec .",
    "vi . finally , appendix a provides further details regarding the bcs transformation and vacuum state while appendix b presents the most general tda equation for arbitrary angular momentum .",
    "by introducing a phenomenological confining potential , @xmath10 , the qcd coulomb gauge hamiltonian @xcite for the quark sector can be replaced by an effective hamiltonian    @xmath11    where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the current ( bare ) quark field , mass and color density , respectively ( for a more complete discussion , especially for the heavy quark sector , consult refs .",
    "@xcite ) . for notational",
    "ease the flavor subscript is omitted ( same @xmath0 for each flavor ) and the color index runs @xmath15 .",
    "motivated by lattice gauge studies we adopt a linear confining interaction , @xmath16 , with slope @xmath17 @xmath18 also specified by lattice and regge phenomenology . in our analysis",
    "we have also performed calculations with and without the leading qcd canonical or coulomb ( one - gluon exchange ) interaction , @xmath19 , with @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 . for most observables , especially the meson mass spectrum ,",
    "the coulomb interaction is not important and can be omitted .",
    "this can be understood by noting that in momentum space , where we perform all calculations , the two interactions have the same sign , i.e. @xmath23    @xmath24    because the meson wavefunctions have a finite momentum distribution , most static meson properties are predominantly governed by the infrared ( ir ) , or low , momentum region where the confining potential dominates . including the coulomb interaction is then roughly equivalent to using a slightly larger string tension , @xmath25 .",
    "there are certain observables , and in particular the gap equation detailed below , for which the coulomb interaction is ultra - violet ( uv ) divergent . in such cases",
    "we regularize with a cut - off parameter and then could renormalize to remove cut - off sensitivity using one of our renormalization procedures detailed in refs .",
    "@xcite for the gluon sector . in this paper we only present unrenormalized results since this program is still in progress @xcite and",
    "has not yet been completed for the quark sector .",
    "this is an additional reason for omitting the coulomb interaction .",
    "hence , with the exception of the current quark masses ( we use @xmath26 @xmath27 , @xmath28 @xmath27 , @xmath29 @xmath27 ) , our approach entails only one pre - determined parameter which also sets the hadronic scale , @xmath30 @xmath27 .",
    "we further note that even though the confining potential is ir divergent , this singularity is cancelled ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) in both the mass gap equation and all calculations for associated observables . hence",
    ", the problem is the delicate numerical evaluation of this integrable singularity which we discuss in sec .",
    "finally , we stress that in constituent quark models free quarks can exist which requires imposing color confinement .",
    "however , as demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite the lorentz structure of our coulomb gauge density - density confining interaction only permits stable solutions for color singlet states .",
    "therefore , confinement naturally emerges in our approach .",
    "we now wish to solve @xmath31 as accurately as possible . in this subsection",
    "we focus on the ground state and introduce the bogoliubov - valatin , or bcs , transformation .",
    "we begin by recalling the plane wave , spinor expansion for the quark field operator    @xmath32 e^{i\\vec{k } \\cdot \\vec{x}}\\ ] ]    with free particle , anti - particle spinors @xmath33 and bare creation , annihilation operators @xmath34 for current quarks , respectively . here the spin state ( helicity ) is denoted by @xmath35 and color index by @xmath36 ( which is hereafter suppressed ) .",
    "because we can expand @xmath12 in terms of any complete basis we may equally well use a new quasiparticle basis @xmath37 e^{i\\vec{k } \\cdot \\vec{x}}\\ ] ] entailing quasiparticle spinors @xmath38 and operators @xmath39 .",
    "the hamiltonian is equivalent in either basis and the two are related by a similarity ( bogoliubov - valatin or bcs ) transformation .",
    "the transformation between operators is given by the rotation @xmath40 @xmath41 involving the bcs angle @xmath42 .",
    "similarly the rotated quasiparticle spinors are @xmath43\\ ] ] @xmath44\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the standard two - dimensional pauli spinor .",
    "we have also introduced the gap angle , @xmath46 , which is related to the bcs angle , @xmath47 , by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the current , or perturbative , mass angle satisfying @xmath50 with @xmath51 . hence @xmath52",
    "@xmath53    similarly , the perturbative , trivial vacuum , defined by @xmath54 , is related to the quasiparticle vacuum , @xmath55 , by the transformation @xmath56 in this paper we will denote the bcs vacuum by @xmath57 ( in sec .",
    "iv we introduce the rpa vacuum labeled @xmath58 ) . expanding the exponential and noting that the form of the operator @xmath59 is designed to create a current quark / antiquark pair with the vacuum quantum numbers , clearly exhibits the bcs vacuum as a coherent state of quark / antiquark excitations ( cooper pairs ) representing @xmath60@xmath61p@xmath62 condensates .",
    "one can regard @xmath63 as the momentum wavefunction of the pair in the center of momentum system .",
    "we now seek an approximate ground state for our effective hamiltonian by minimizing the bcs vacuum expectation , @xmath64 .",
    "we do this variationally using the gap angle , @xmath65 , ( not the bcs angle ) which leads to the gap equation , @xmath66 .",
    "after considerable mathematical reduction , the nonlinear integral gap equation follows @xmath67 \\ .\\ ] ] the angular integrals can be analytically evaluated ( see appendix b ) to give    @xmath68\\ ] ]    where @xmath69 @xmath70\\ ] ] corresponding to the linear potential above .",
    "similar expressions for the coulomb potential are given in appendix b.    there are several alternative ways to derive this same gap equation .",
    "one is through the ward identites .",
    "another is by requiring cancellation of the anomalous bogoliubov terms in the 2-body part of the newly normal ordered hamiltonian .",
    "the latter is necessary to stabilize the vacuum and is also equivalent to minimizing the 0-body constant energy splitting the bcs and trivial vacua ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "numerically we actually solve a different form of the gap equation , originally obtained by adler and davis @xcite , that is more familiar to the solid state community .",
    "they use the function @xmath71 related to our gap angle by @xmath72 @xmath73 with corresponding gap equation @xmath74    examination of eqs .",
    "( [ gap1d],[gap1d ] ) reveals that the divergence at @xmath75 is an integrable singularity for the linear potential since for all @xmath76 the integrands vanish at @xmath75 .",
    "this is not the case for the coulomb potential uv singularity .",
    "however , since it naturally emerges from the canonical qcd hamiltonian ( one gluon exchange ) , we retain the option of including this potential for selected calculations and use a cut - off to regulate its ultraviolet ( uv ) divergence .",
    "the solution of the gap equation ( see sec .",
    "iii ) leads to a vacuum quark - antiquark condensate given by    @xmath77    which is quadratically divergent for non - zero current quark mass @xmath78 .",
    "we regulate this by subtracting the trivial condensate contribution giving    @xmath79    our model is color confining and does not permit free solitary particles since the self - energy or dispersion relation    @xmath80    obtained from the 1-body part of @xmath0 , eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , is divergent ( now there is no cancellation at the singular point @xmath81 ) .",
    "further , this divergence is also cancelled in the bound state equation but only for color singlet states ( see below ) . even though the self - energy diverges it",
    "is still useful to introduce the concept of an effective quasiparticle ( constituent ) mass , @xmath82 , which can be extracted from the low momentum behavior of the gap angle .",
    "we introduce a running , dynamical mass , @xmath83 , by an effective dirac spinor in canonical form @xmath84\\ ] ] with normalization @xmath85 and @xmath86 . then using this equation and eq .",
    "( [ inversebv ] ) we equate the two relative normalizations between upper and lower spinor components yielding a relation between the running dynamical mass and gap angle @xmath87 or @xmath88 we identify the dressed quark or quasiparticle mass as @xmath89 and extract it from the low momentum behavior of the gap angle ( essentially inverse of the slope near zero momentum ) .",
    "the value of @xmath90 characterizes the degree of chiral symmetry breaking and can be loosely regarded as the constituent quark mass associated with phenomenological quark models .",
    "note that our expression for the running mass is functionally identical to the perturbative expression @xmath91 .",
    "related , since the rotated quasiparticle spinors have a running momentum dependence , they no longer rigorously provide a representation of the lorentz group .",
    "our form of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking violates lorentz invariance which implies a preferred reference frame , namely the condensate rest frame . for most static observables such as masses , condensates and decay constants ,",
    "lorentz symmetry is not important .",
    "however , for some observables , such as electromagnetic form factors , care is necessary and boost corrections may be important .",
    "this issue is under investigation and will be reported in a future communication .      the classical effective model of nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for review ) entails various lagrangian formulations , a common one being @xmath92\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is a constant .",
    "it is customary to introduce the approximations @xmath94 and @xmath95 to linearize the equations of motion and then extract a constituent quark mass from the njl mass gap equation .",
    "in this fashion chiral symmetry breaking is achieved .",
    "our formulation extends beyond the njl model in several important ways .    1 .",
    "our approach is more general and permits explicit gluonic degrees of freedom ( see refs .",
    "the unification of the quark and glue sectors is crucial for a comprehensive treatment of hadron structure , especially for glueball and hybrid meson systems .",
    "our formulation includes confinement and is renormalizable while the njl model has neither .",
    "the njl pointlike interaction would be recovered in the limit @xmath96 which removes all important nonlocalities .",
    "3 .   our model has a density - density interaction kernel with a different lorentz structure , @xmath97 , which is the product of four - vector time components . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a density - density ( vector - vector ) interaction is superior to the scalar - pseudoscalar displayed by the njl model .",
    "the chiral symmetry breaking mode of the njl is extremely restrictive yielding a constant quasiparticle mass , @xmath98 , and simple dispersion @xmath99 .",
    "related , the njl limit of our model also yields a more restricted gap angle since @xmath100 .",
    "our method has a running mass and different quasiparticle dispersion which yields more realistic tda and rpa hadron masses .",
    "the gap equation ( [ gap1d ] ) has been previously solved for the harmonic oscillator potential , where it takes its simplest form as a differential equation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and also for the linear potential ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "we summarize our analysis which confirms and extends the latter results .    to numerically treat the integrable ir singularity a regularization",
    "must still be implemented even though the final results are independent of this procedure .",
    "we considered several different regularizations .",
    "we first tried an analytical regulator ( equivalent to a deconfining correction to the potential ) .",
    "this was an unstable algorithm and and convergence could not be achieved .",
    "we next examined the method of ref .",
    "@xcite which off - sets the q - discretization by half a step in the kernel with respect to the k - discretization .",
    "this procedure was also rejected as it was less amenable for documenting the regulator sensitivity .",
    "we finally adopted the simplest method of omitting the singular point @xmath101 .",
    "this also facilitated a controlled senstivity study by just increasing the number of mesh points .",
    "related , we adopted a variable mesh size to integrate more efficiently and mapped the integration variable @xmath102 to @xmath103 @xmath104 for n points uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath105 .",

    "@xcite we elected to solve the gap equation in form specified by eq .",
    "( [ gap1d ] ) and also utilized the gauss algorithm as described there .",
    "the gauss method assures convergence but is rather inefficient for extensive sensivity studies in parameter space .",
    "we therefore modified our numerical approach by first finding a good approximate solution , @xmath106 , to the non - linear gap equation and then obtained a linear equation for the desired correction , @xmath107 , giving the final solution @xmath108 to arbitrary accuracy . substituting eq .",

    "we found the gauss algorithm sufficient for obtaining the initial approximate solution @xmath106 . to achieve full convergence required up to 12,000 mesh points , a factor of 60 more than the early calculations of ref .",

    "including the coulomb potential only increases the condensate to @xmath121 .",
    "we therefore conclude an improved model ground state is needed which can be provided by including additional terms in the hamiltonian , such as the quark - gluon minimal coupling ( hyperfine ) interaction .",
    "this point is also affirmed below in our rpa treatment which does yield a more realistic condensate value .",
    "our other key result , which will be of interest in connection with chiral perturbation theory @xcite , is for the constituent quark mass and the bcs condensate as a function of the @xmath122 , @xmath123 quark mass .",
    "now it is necessary to use eq .",

    "a precision calculation for @xmath90 with @xmath128 yields the slightly higher value @xmath129 @xmath130 ( all values for the linear potential only ) .",
    "finally , we note that our hamiltonian is @xmath7 flavor symmetric , broken only by the small current flavored quark mass term . however , and quite significant , the vacuum properties and gap angle exhibit substantial @xmath7 violations as evidenced by our strange quark calculations using a current mass of 150 @xmath27 .",
    "important violations occur even for a strange quark mass as low as 50 @xmath27 .",
    "while this result may be model dependent it does suggest that certain chiral symmetry arguments in the literature regarding the strange quark sector should be taken with care .",
    "we now formulate mesons as excited states consisting of quasiparticles and seek approximate eigensolutions of our hamiltonian .",
    "we first develop the tda and then treat the rpa in the next subsection . of the two , only the rpa preserves chiral symmetry , as we detail below .",
    "it is therefore more closely related to the bethe - salpeter formalism @xcite incorporating the schwinger - dyson quark propagator using an instantaneous interaction in the rainbow approximation ( equivalent to our gap equation ) .",
    "we will document this connection more formally in a future publication .",

    "( [ tdaop ] ) above , does not commute with @xmath235 and violates chiral symmetry since it is not fully symmetric in operator structure ( only contains @xmath236 and not @xmath207 ) .",
    "this can also be documented by chiral transforming the tda meson state verifing that @xmath237 rotates to combinations of @xmath238 , @xmath239 and @xmath240 .",
    "hence , the tda ansatz is not closed under a chiral rotation and goldstone bosons will not appear in the tda spectrum .",
    "we therefore expect significant , but unphysical , chiral symmetry violations in the tda calculations and anticipate the tda pion mass to be much larger than in the rpa which is confirmed in sec .",
    "v as only the rpa calculations yield a goldstone pion in the chiral limit .    on the other hand , the rpa ansatz , eq .",

    "hence the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking is present and the pion mass is zero according to its goldstone boson nature as we numerically verify in the next section .    with these results",

    "our one parameter model can not accurately describe the entire observed splitting indicating additional dynamics beyond simple spin interactions from a dirac spinor field is needed . in general , the masses are in good agreement with the pdg @xcite accepted values for the vector mesons , but the tda low - lying pseudoscalar sector is deficient .",
    "this is expected since in this channel vacuum ( chiral symmetry ) effects are most prominent . in the scalar channel",
    "the situation is more confusing , since other hadron states , some with explicit gluonic structure , can more easily mix .",
    "since our unified model allows us to treat glueballs , mesons and hybrids comprehensively , future work will further address understanding this channel .",
    "interestingly , our lightest @xmath280 mass , which has a p wave oribital excitation , is below 1 @xmath125 .",
    "we also find that the computed tda masses are not very sensitive to details of the vacuum that enters via the gap function characterizing the bcs ground state .",
    "as described above , we may also use a simplified tda equation to extract a constituent quark mass . in the chiral limit ,",
    "the mass obtained is 51 @xmath27 and this dressing is roughly constant , consistent with @xmath7 symmetry , up to current masses of 150 @xmath27 , where the generated constituent mass is 203 @xmath27 .",
    "we are therefore dealing with light dressed quarks , even for strange quarks which may prove a deficiency when calculating electromagnetic form factors .",
    "we shall also address this issue in the near future .",
    "another important feature of our relativistic effective hamiltonian is that it naturally includes the kinematical and spin dependent interactions ( e.g. spin - spin , spin - orbit , tensor ) .",
    "these effects are very important in the light quark sector even after chiral symmetry breaking , because the light quark constituent mass generated in our scheme , around 80 @xmath27 , is still small as compared to our interaction scale ( 424 @xmath27 ) .",
    "in particular , notice in table ii the spin splitting between the @xmath264 , @xmath281 and @xmath282 mesons , all having the same @xmath283 and @xmath284 quantum numbers ( also observe the large radial excitation in each channel ) .",
    "the level spacing is consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite but very different from the naive expectations from the constituent quark model .",
    "the is due to the confining ( nonperturbative ) @xmath285 coupling , which is only of order @xmath286 in the constituent quark model .",

    "the @xmath290 in this expression describes the light scalar meson , whereas the @xmath291 contribution explains the splittings in table ii .",
    "the calculated @xmath282 mass is much heavier than the lightest observed @xmath292 at 1270 @xmath27 .",
    "clearly , including coupling to the @xmath293 , @xmath294 channel as well as multi - quark fock states will alter , but improve , our prediction .",
    "further , and as mentioned previously , additional quark - gluon interaction terms should also be included in our hamiltonian which have a different lorentz spin structure . in our model",
    "this would generate a weaker hyperfine interaction of order @xmath286 .",
    "this would also provide additional splitting between @xmath295 and @xmath190 levels that would improve our tda , and especially rpa , @xmath3-@xmath4 mass underprediction .",
    "such an analysis would fully clarify the relative importance of chiral symmetry versus spin interactions as the latter is generally attributed the dominant effect in conventional constituent quark models having color magnetic , effective one gluon exchange potentials ( see ref .",
    "we are currently examining this issue and will report results in a future paper .",
    "finally and also related is the spin - orbit splitting for other flavors which is summarized in tables i and iv . in table",
    "iv we illustrate the familiar @xmath296 dependence by fitting the tda spectrum for different flavors .",
    "we now present our rpa results and compare with both tda and observation .",
    "table iii and figs . 2 through 7 highlight our key results .",
    "in general the rpa and tda masses agree except for the light pseudoscalar mesons where the rpa provides a better description .",
    "this is because , as discussed above , only the rpa correctly implements chiral symmetry as illustrated in fig .",
    "3 where the lightest scalar and pseudoscalar masses are plotted as a continuous function of the current quark mass .",
    "note that only the pseudoscalar mass approaches zero in the chiral limit consistent with goldstone s theorem ( the observed pion mass is reproduced for a @xmath122 quark mass of about 2 @xmath27 ) .",
    "the kaon system reveals the largest model deficiency ( see table i ) .",
    "even the rpa in the chiral limit produces a too massive kaon , about 850 @xmath27 . as indicated by fig . 4 , to reproduce the observed kaon requires a strange quark mass of about 50 @xmath27 .",
    "a detailed analysis reveals that the explicit contribution of the current quark mass to the rpa equation -through its appearance in @xmath297- is only additive .",
    "it is the gap angle , introducing an implicit flavor dependence , which inhibits a lighter kaon mass .",
    "we could fit both pion and kaon masses by adjusting the current quark masses , but we prefer awaiting improvements from renormalizing the quark gap equation ( work in progress and will be subsequently publish ) .",
    "the gap angle for a non - zero current quark mass is very sensitive at high momentum to the dominanting coulomb potential and sizeable corrections are expected .",
    "also for higher lying excited meson states there is also the issue of two particle , two hole fock state contributions .    in fig .",
    "5 we compare our scalar , pseudovector and tensor meson tda and rpa predictions to data . in general",
    "there is qualitative agreement .",
    "note that for the higher excited states above 1 @xmath125 the tda and rpa results are identical and it is clear that these systems are not governed by chiral symmetry .",
    "we also illustrate the behavior of various wavefunctions . in fig .",
    "6 we detail the difference between tda wavefunctions for the @xmath280 and @xmath3 mesons .",
    "figure 7 compares the tda and rpa wavefunctions for the pion .",
    "finally we discuss decay constants .",
    "both the tda and rpa pion decay constants are too small , about 17 @xmath27 , in contrast to the observed value of 93 @xmath27 .",
    "this is consistent with the orsay @xcite results .",
    "we again attribute this to the model hamiltonian and vacuum as the bcs angle does not have sufficiently high momentum components . however ,",
    "if we use the approximate rpa vacuum in the quasiboson approximation ( see eq .",
    "( 4.25 ) ) the improved rpa decay constant increases to 57 @xmath27 . appropriately",
    ", the condensate also significantly increases to @xmath298 , in much better agreement with lattice results @xmath299 .",
    "the latter result is consistent with applications in nuclear physics where the rpa tends to overcorrelate the ground state .",
    "since we have only approximately evaluated the rpa vacuum by truncating at the two pion level it is not surprising that @xmath300 does not agree with measurement ( or chiral perturbation theory results ) and therefore needs further refining .",
    "we expect the truncation to the two pion level , eq . ( [ rpavacuum ] ) , to be reasonable provided we are not in the chiral limit , since then @xmath301 .",
    "however , we would like to be able to calculate in that regime .",
    "further , the calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite points to a necessary decrease of the bcs condensate when including coupled channels .",
    "they argue that for a pure chiral pion , coupling additional channels would decrease its mass which might even become negative , destabilizing the vacuum .",
    "this argument seems sound and since we are above the chiral quark mass limit , at a model value @xmath302 @xmath27 where our pion is too massive ( 277 @xmath27 ) , this decrease is a welcome improvement .",
    "we defer further discussion until publication by our collaborative effort with the lisbon group which will also clarify pionic correlations in the ground state of our approach .    recalling that our computed condensates require renormalization except in the chiral limit",
    ", we can only test the gmor relation for @xmath117 which is trivially satisfied in the rpa .",
    "however , we note that the decay constants for excited pion states are much smaller and rapidly approach zero in the chiral limit .",
    "hence the gmor relation is satisfied with predominatly the first state .",
    "this is not true for heavier quarks and to numerically satisfy the gmor requires including several eigenstates .",
    "an extremely challenging but still not understood problem is the @xmath8 , @xmath9 system and attending flavor mixing of the light quarks .",
    "although our effective hamiltonian has an explicit flavor dependence through the current quark masses , it still conserves flavor .",
    "however , if the gluon sector is included , such as through the hyperfine , minimal coupling interaction , an effective flavor dependence naturally emerges though higher order quark - glue - quark effects and dynamic mixing of flavor states is possible .",
    "we are currently deriving such a term which is similar , but more rigorous than the thooft interaction based upon instantons ( classical glue ) .",
    "this will be reported in a future communication , however , it is still of interest to perform a simple @xmath8 , @xmath9 mixing analysis by introducing a flavor off - diagonal interaction as we now detail .    with no dynamic flavor mixing ,",

    "@xmath9 masses are @xmath313 for the rpa , @xmath311 290 @xmath27 and @xmath312 978 @xmath27 , yielding @xmath314 @xmath27 and @xmath315 @xmath27 .",

    "the rpa values are @xmath323 @xmath27 and @xmath320 @xmath27 , giving @xmath324 @xmath27 and @xmath322 63 @xmath27 .",

    "we could also improve the decay constants utilizing a two angle mixing formalism @xcite but refrain since clearly a more sophisticated treatment is necessary which will be provided by our quark - gluon coupling formulation in the near future .",
    "the constituent quark models and non - relativistic expansions of qcd offer more reliable results for heavy quark systems where physical intuition from quantum mechanical bound states is more appropriate .",
    "hence the charmed mesons afford a good limiting testing for our relativistic approach .",
    "we again calculate the spectrum of the charmed mesons ( see figures [ [ ucspectrum],[scspectrum ] ] ) and of charmonium ( fig . [ [ ccspectrum ] ] ) using our many - body model .",
    "the tda is now sufficient since chiral symmetry , crucial for the light mesons , is not a constraint and the rpa will produce the same results . using a charmed quark mass of 1200 @xmath27 ,",
    "the general features of the spectra are well reproduced and the radial excitations , @xmath344 and @xmath345 , are adequately described .",
    "we therefore expect our predictions for the remaining unconfirmed states to be reasonable .",
    "the angular momentum splittings of these systems are known to be dominated by the one gluon exchange potential ( oge ) which we have not included in this calculation .",
    "hence there will be improvement from future calculations based upon our renormalized project . a general feature reflected by our charmed spectra",
    "is the near vanishing of the spin - spin interaction , leading to degenerate @xmath346 and @xmath347 states .",
    "since the 100 - 150 @xmath27 hyperfine splittings in these systems will presumably be recovered when we include the perturbative oge , we do not comment further . as for the spin - orbit splittings , our results are too large for the @xmath192 mesons and too small for the @xmath348 mesons .",
    "these splittings are adequately explained in non - relativistic quark models ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) where the absence of a large spin - orbit effect for light quark masses is attributed to the cancellation between the thomas precession in the confining potential and the one gluon exchange effective potential , although it is a bit concerning that the actual splitting between the @xmath349 and the @xmath350 is twice the size of the @xmath350-@xmath351 splitting , when according to the spin - orbit @xmath291 rule , it should be a half .",
    "finally , we note that by including d waves in the charmonium spectrum we are able to resolve the long standing `` overpopulation '' problem of @xmath5 states relative to observation .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "this ( previous ) deficiency in number of @xmath352 states has been characterized as evidence for glueballs and/or hybrid mesons because the @xmath5 system is believed to be gluon rich .",
    "our result suggests , however , that simple level counting may not be effective in identifying hadrons with explicit gluonic degrees of freedom .",
    "before summarizing our results we comment on the strengths and weaknesses of our many - body approach as well as some attending , open hadronic physics issues . beginning with our hamiltonian , @xmath0 , the current - current (",
    "density - density ) color interaction forbids free , isolated colored objects in the theory . for the vacuum",
    "this is realized in the bcs by an infinite shift in the free quark self - energy due to the integral of @xmath353 .",
    "similarly for hadrons in both tda and rpa , colored composite objects ( e.g. diquarks ) are precluded by the appearance of @xmath354 which is divergent , whereas in the singlet channel this divergence is removed by vanishing color factors .",
    "next we note that @xmath0 conserves chiral symmetry yet our bcs vacuum properly exhibits dynamic chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "further , our rpa pion emerges as a goldstone boson in the chiral limit .",
    "this is not true for the tda pion since only the rpa excitation operator commutes with the chiral charge .",
    "another , significant model feature is that fock state truncation is a controlable approximation amendable to systematic improvement .",
    "thus our hamiltonian many - body approach is an attractive , promising method for comprehensively investigating hadronic structure as it embodies confinement , chiral symmetry breaking and orderly construction of multiparticle fock states .",
    "it also provides an excellent vehicle for testing more fundamental effective hamiltonians as well as affording a powerful phenomenological framework for hadron structure .",
    "considering the form of @xmath0 , with only a single predetermined dynamical parameter , it is encouraging that the chiral limit is adequately reached in the rpa and that the meson spectrum is in qualitative agreement with experiment . to achieve detailed",
    ", quantitative descriptions will require further improvements in both the hamiltonian and effects from including higher fock space components .",
    "in particular , both the high energy behavior ( coulomb potential ) and quark - gluon coupling effects ( efectively instantons ) will be incorporated and reported in a future publication . finally , our current study is similar , but more extensive than the orsay analysis @xcite due to our application to multiflavor systems .",
    "our results are also more realistic ( and numerically more difficult ) then that work since we have utilized a linear confining interaction , determined by lattice and regge phenomenology , which generates complicated nonlocal integral equations , rather than solving a simpler differential equation for a harmonic oscillator potential .    summarizing , we have performed approximate , but large - scale diagonalizations of an effective coulomb gauge hamiltonian utilizing standard many - body techniques . using the bcs ,",
    "a non - linear gap equation has been derived and accurately solved to provide vacuum properties ( quasiparticles and condensates ) .",
    "incorporating only predetermined parameters ( string tension , @xmath25 , and reasonable current quark masses ) , we have qualitatively reproduced the low energy @xmath355 and @xmath2 meson spectra .",
    "most importantly , we have obtained a chiral pion , detailed that chiral symmetry is responsible for the large @xmath356 mass splitting and resolved the problem of overpopulation of theoretical @xmath5 states .",

    "<S> we represent qcd at the hadronic scale by means of an effective hamiltonian , @xmath0 , formulated in the coulomb gauge . as in the nambu - jona - lasinio model , chiral symmetry </S>",
    "<S> is explicity broken , however our approach is renormalizable and also includes confinement through a linear potential with slope specified by lattice gauge theory . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction generates an infrared integrable singularity and we detail the computationally intensive procedure necessary for numerical solution . </S>",
    "<S> we focus upon applications for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 quark flavors and compute the mass spectrum for the pseudoscalar , scalar and vector mesons . </S>",
    "<S> we also perform a comparative study of alternative many - body techniques for approximately diagonalizing @xmath0 : bcs for the vacuum ground state ; tda and rpa for the excited hadron states . </S>",
    "<S> the dirac structure of the field theoretical hamiltonian naturally generates spin - dependent interactions , including tensor , spin - orbit and hyperfine , and we clarify the degree of level splitting due to both spin and chiral symmetry effects . </S>",
    "<S> significantly , we find that roughly two - thirds of the @xmath3-@xmath4 mass difference is due to chiral symmetry and that only the rpa preserves chiral symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we also document how hadronic mass scales are generated by chiral symmetry breaking in the model vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the vacuum condensates , we compute meson decay constants and detail the nambu - goldstone realization of chiral symmetry by numerically verifying the gell - mann - oaks - renner relation . finally , by including d waves in our charmonium calculation we have resolved the anomalous overpopulation of @xmath5 states relative to observation . + pac number(s ) : 12.39.pn , 12.40.yx </S>"
