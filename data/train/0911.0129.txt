    "[ [ sec : la ] ]    finding the irreducible characters is a fundamental problem in representation theory . as a prototype of this problem , consider a complex semisimple lie algebra @xmath2 .",
    "the problem is solved in two steps , following the historical development :    1 .",
    "the category of finite dimensional @xmath2-modules is semisimple and the corresponding irreducible @xmath2-characters are given by weyl s character formula .",
    "a general solution to the irreducible character problem in the bgg category @xmath0 was given much later by the kazhdan - lusztig ( kl ) polynomials ( theorems of beilinson - bernstein and brylinski - kashiwara ) @xcite .",
    "[ [ sec : lsa ] ]    the study of lie superalgebras and their representations was largely motivated by the notion of supersymmetry in physics .",
    "a killing - cartan type classification of finite dimensional complex simple lie superalgebras was achieved by kac @xcite in 1977 .",
    "the most important subclass of the simple lie superalgebras ( called basic classical ) , including two infinite series of types @xmath3 and @xmath4 , bears a close resemblance to the usual simple lie algebras , so we can make sense of root systems , dynkin diagrams , triangular decomposition , cartan and borel subalgebras , ( parabolic ) category @xmath0 , and so on .",
    "however , the representation theory of lie superalgebras @xmath5 has encountered several substantial difficulties , as made clear by numerous works over the last three decades ( cf .",
    "@xcite as a sample of earlier literature , and some more recent references which can be found in the next paragraph ) :    1 .   there exist non - conjugate borel subalgebras for a given lie superalgebra @xmath5 .",
    "the category @xmath6 of finite dimensional @xmath5-modules is in general not semisimple .",
    "a uniform weyl type finite dimensional character formula does not exist .",
    "3 .   one has a notion of a weyl group associated to the even subalgebra of @xmath5 ; however , the linkage in the category @xmath0 ( or in @xmath6 ) of @xmath5-modules is not solely controlled by the weyl group .",
    "4 .   a block in the category @xmath0 ( or in @xmath6 )",
    "may contain infinitely many simple objects .",
    "the conventional wisdom of solving the irreducible character problem for lie superalgebras has been to follow closely the two steps for lie algebras in [ sec : la ] . as the problem is already very difficult in the category @xmath6 ,",
    "there has been little attempt in understanding the category @xmath0 .    for type @xmath3",
    "lie superalgebra @xmath7 , there have been several different general approaches over the years .",
    "serganova @xcite in 1996 developed a mixed geometric and algebraic approach to solving the irreducible character problem in the category @xmath6 .",
    "brundan in 2003 @xcite developed a new elegant purely algebraic solution to the same problem in @xmath6 using lusztig - kashiwara canonical basis .",
    "developing the idea of super duality @xcite ( which generalizes @xcite ) which connects the categories @xmath0 for lie superalgebras and lie algebras of type @xmath3 for the first time , two of the authors @xcite very recently established the super duality conjecture therein .",
    "in particular they provided a complete solution to the irreducible character problem for a fairly general parabolic category @xmath0 ( including @xmath6 as a very special case ) in terms of kl polynomials of type @xmath3 .",
    "independently , brundan and stroppel @xcite proved the super duality conjecture in @xcite , offering yet another solution of the irreducible character problem in @xmath6 .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    the goal of this paper is to formulate and establish a super duality which connects parabolic category @xmath0 for lie superalgebra of type @xmath4 with parabolic category @xmath0 for classical lie algebras of types @xmath1 , vastly generalizing the type @xmath3 case of @xcite . in particular",
    ", it provides a complete solution of the irreducible character problem for @xmath4 in some suitable parabolic category @xmath0 , which includes all finite dimensional irreducibles , in terms of parabolic kl polynomials of @xmath1 types ( cf .",
    "deodhar @xcite ) .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    before launching on a detailed explanation of our main ideas below , it is helpful to keep in mind the analogy that the ring of symmetric functions ( or its super counterpart ) in infinitely many variables carries more symmetries than in finitely many variables , and a truncation process can easily recover finitely many variables .",
    "the super duality can be morally thought as a categorification of the standard involution @xmath8 on the ring of symmetric functions and it only becomes manifest when the underlying lie ( super)algebras pass to infinite rank . then truncation functors can be used to recover the finite rank cases which we are originally interested in .    even though the finite dimensional lie superalgebras of type @xmath4 depend on two integers @xmath9 and @xmath10 , our view is to fix one and let the other , say @xmath10 , vary , and so let us denote an @xmath4 lie superalgebra by @xmath11 . by choosing appropriately a borel and a levi subalgebra of @xmath11",
    ", we formulate a suitable parabolic category @xmath12 of @xmath11-modules .",
    "it turns out that there are four natural choices one can make here which correspond to the four dynkin diagrams @xmath13 in [ dynkin ] ( the type @xmath14 case has been treated in @xcite ) .",
    "there is a natural sequence of inclusions of lie superalgebras : @xmath15 let @xmath16 .",
    "a suitable category @xmath17 of @xmath5-modules can be identified with the inverse limit @xmath18 . on the other hand , we introduce truncation functors @xmath19 for @xmath20 , as analogues of the truncation functors studied in algebraic group setting ( cf .",
    "donkin @xcite ) .",
    "these truncation functors send parabolic verma modules to parabolic vermas or zero and irreducibles to irreducibles or zero . in particular , this allows us to derive the irreducible characters in @xmath12 once we know those in @xmath21 .",
    "corresponding to each of the above choices of @xmath11 and @xmath22 , we have the lie algebra counterparts @xmath23 and parabolic categories @xmath24 for positive integers @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , we have natural inclusions of lie algebras @xmath25 , for all @xmath10 , which allow us to define the lie algebra @xmath26 and the parabolic category @xmath27 of @xmath2-modules .",
    "similarly , the category @xmath27 can be identified with the inverse limit @xmath28 . in the main body of the paper ,",
    "we actually replace @xmath29 et cetera by their ( trivial ) central extensions .",
    "the reason is that the truncation functors depend implicitly on a stabilization scalar , which is interpreted conceptually as a level of representations with respect to the central extensions .    to establish a connection between @xmath17 and @xmath27",
    ", we introduce another infinite rank lie superalgebra @xmath30 and its parabolic category @xmath31 .",
    "the lie superalgebra @xmath30 contains @xmath2 and @xmath5 as natural subalgebras ( though not as levi subalgebras ) , and this enables us to introduce two natural functors @xmath32 and @xmath33 . using the technique of odd reflections among others , we establish in section  [ sec : character ] a key property that @xmath34 and @xmath35 respect the parabolic verma and irreducible modules , respectively .",
    "this result is already sufficient to provide a complete solution of irreducible @xmath4-characters in the category @xmath12 in the first half of the paper ( by the end of section  [ sec : t ] ) .",
    "we remark that the idea of introducing an auxiliary lie superalgebra @xmath30 and category @xmath36 has been used in the type @xmath3 superalgebra setting @xcite .",
    "recall that for the usual category @xmath0 of lie algebras , the kl polynomials were interpreted by vogan @xcite in terms of kostant @xmath37-homology groups .",
    "the @xmath38-homology groups make perfect sense for lie superalgebras , and we may take this interpretation as the definition for the otherwise undefined kl polynomials in category @xmath0 for lie superalgebras ( cf .  section [ sec : lsa ]  ( 3 ) ) , as serganova @xcite did in the category @xmath6 of @xmath39-modules . in section",
    "[ sec : homology ] , we show that the functors @xmath34 and @xmath35 match the corresponding @xmath37-homology groups and hence the corresponding kl polynomials ( compare @xcite ) . actually the computation in @xcite of the @xmath37-homology groups with coefficients in the lie superalgebra oscillator modules via howe duality was the first direct supporting evidence for the super duality for @xmath4 as formulated in this paper .",
    "section  [ sec : category ] of the paper is devoted to proving that both @xmath34 and @xmath35 are indeed category equivalences . as a consequence",
    ", we have established that the categories @xmath40 and @xmath21 are equivalent , which is called super duality .",
    "a technical difference here from @xcite is that we need to deal with the fact that parabolic verma modules in @xmath21 may not have finite composition series .",
    "an immediate corollary of the super duality is that any known bgg resolution in the category @xmath40 gives rise to a bgg type resolution in the category @xmath21 , and vice versa .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    the finite dimensional irreducible @xmath4-modules are of highest weight , and they are classified in terms of the dynkin labels by kac @xcite .",
    "we note that the finite dimensional irreducible modules of non - integral highest weights are typical and so their characters are known ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1 ) .",
    "it turns out that a more natural labeling of the remaining finite dimensional irreducible @xmath4-modules ( of integral highest weights ) is given in terms of young diagrams just as for classical lie algebras ( see e.g. @xcite for such a formulation and a new proof using odd reflections ) .",
    "as borel subalgebras are not conjugate to each other , it becomes a nontrivial problem to find the extremal weights , i.e.  highest weights with respect to different borel , of a given finite dimensional irreducible @xmath4-module .",
    "we provide an elegant and simple answer in terms of a combinatorial notion which we call _ block frobenius coordinates _ associated to young diagrams .",
    "we observe that our solution of the irreducible character problem in @xmath22 includes solutions to all finite dimensional irreducible @xmath4-characters .",
    "the category @xmath6 for a general @xmath4 ( with the exception of @xmath41 ) is not a highest weight category and does not admit an abstract kl theory in the sense of cline , parshall and scott @xcite , as indicated in the case of @xmath42 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  2 ) .",
    "for a completely independent and different approach to the finite dimensional irreducible @xmath4-characters in the category @xmath6 , see gruson and serganova @xcite .",
    "the finite dimensional irreducible characters of @xmath41 were obtained in @xcite .",
    "the finite dimensional irreducible characters of @xmath43 were also computed in @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    in hindsight , here is how our super duality approach overcomes the difficulties as listed in [ sec : lsa ] .    1 .",
    "the existence of non - conjugate borel subalgebras for a lie superalgebra is essential for establishing the properties of the functors @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "choices of suitable borel subalgebras are crucial for a formulation of the compatible sequence of categories @xmath22 for @xmath44 .",
    "2 .   the category @xmath6 of finite dimensional @xmath11-modules does not play any special role in our approach .",
    "even the  natural \" @xmath45-modules @xmath46 do not correspond well with each other under truncation functors , as they are natural with respect to the ",
    "wrong \" borel .",
    "3 .   in the @xmath47 limit",
    ", the linkage in the category @xmath21 of @xmath5-modules is completely controlled by the weyl group of the corresponding lie algebra @xmath2 ( which contains the even subalgebra of @xmath5 as a subalgebra ) .",
    "4 .   in the @xmath47 limit",
    ", it is no surprise for a block to contain infinitely many simple objects .    in the extreme cases described in section  [ sec : m=0 ] ,",
    "we indeed obtain an equivalence of module categories between two classical ( non - super ! ) lie algebras of types @xmath48 and @xmath49 of infinite rank at opposite levels .",
    "if one is willing to regard @xmath50 as classical ( recall that the finite dimensional @xmath51-module category is semisimple ) , there is another equivalence of categories which relates @xmath50 to the infinite rank lie algebra of type @xmath52 . in this sense ,",
    "our super duality has a flavor of the langlands duality .",
    "the super duality approach here can be further adapted to the setting of kac - moody superalgebras ( including affine superalgebras ) and this will shed new light on the irreducible character problem for these superalgebras . the details will appear elsewhere .",
    "it is well known that the proof of kl conjectures involves deep geometric machinery and results on @xmath49-modules of flag manifolds .",
    "the formulation of super duality suggests potential direct connections on the ( super ) geometric level behind the categories @xmath40 and @xmath21 , which will be very important to develop .",
