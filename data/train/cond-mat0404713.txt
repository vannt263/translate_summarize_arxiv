    "an unexpected discovery of high-@xmath8 superconductivity in 3d - ion oxides in 1986 has revealed the shortcomings of our understanding of the 3d magnetism .",
    "today we do not understand the superconductivity but still we do not have a consistent understanding of electronic and magnetic properties of 3d - ion containing compounds . despite of very different theoretical concepts there is no consensus how to treat electrons in unfilled shells .",
    "many of 3d - ion oxides belong to the class of compounds called the mott insulators - they exhibit the insulating state despite of the unfilled @xmath3 shell .",
    "the fundamental controversy  how to treat the d electrons  starts already at the beginning - should they be treated as localized or itinerant .",
    "directly related to this problem is the structure of the available states : do they form the continuous energy spectrum like it is in the band picture , schematically shown in fig .",
    "1 , or do they form the discrete energy spectrum typical for the localized states . the standard band picture encounters serious difficulties - it often predicts the metallic state for systems that are in the reality very good insulators , for instance for la@xmath1cuo@xmath9 , coo and nio @xcite .",
    "characteristic feature of the present literature description of the 3d - ion magnetism is the spin - only description with the neglect of the orbital magnetism .",
    "this erroneous , according to us , view is related to the widely - spread conviction about the quenching of the orbital moment in 3d - atom compounds .",
    "this observation made in 1932 by van vleck is valid , however , only in the first - order approximation and for that time it was a very important theoretical result - it explained high - temperature dependence of the paramagnetic susceptibility with the spin - only effective moment . from year of 1996",
    "we advocate that it is the highest time in the 3d solid - state physics to",
    " unquench  the orbital moment and to take into account the spin - orbit coupling @xcite because the spin - orbit coupling is well - known physical effect and its neglect causes unphysical oversimplification of the low - energy electronic structure . with very big surprise we found that the present magnetic community is not much enthusiastic about it , but we are fully convinced that the modern description of the magnetism and the electronic structure have to be made in the atomic scale .",
    "one of the reason for this lack of enthusiasm , assuming that it is only a scientific sceptism , can be a fact that we unquench the orbital moment with the use of the crystal - field concept that is disdainfully treated by present great solid - state theoreticians ( experimentalists are widely using the cef theory and the atomic - like picture being pragmatic ) , though there is rapidly growing experimental evidence for its ability to describe exceptionally well many physical properties as it was already shown in numerous papers of van vleck beginning from 1929 .",
    "we are fully aware of the wide overwhelmed critics of the crystal - field approach , started with a paper of slater in 1953 , but we are convinced that this critics is largely improper .",
    "however , we have to say that there is many mistakes , misuses and oversimplifications of the crystal field in the present scientific literature , even in the most prestigious physical journals . a reason for these misuses we think is related to lack of the open scientific discussion and , say , a discrimination of the localized approaches in the presently - in - fashion solid - state theories .",
    "in fact , there is enormous gap between localized picture discovered everyday by experimentalists and most theoretical descriptions preferring itinerancy of 3d electrons .    in order to illustrate better",
    "the physical problems in description of 3d - atom containing compounds let present different electronic structures discussed in recent theoretical approaches to lacoo@xmath0 , for instance .",
    "this compound has been studied by more than 50 years due to its nonmagnetic ground state and unusual temperature dependence of the paramagnetic susceptibility @xmath10(t ) drastically violating the curie - weiss law @xcite with a pronounced maximum at about 100 k. fig . 1 presents result of band - theory calculations for lacoo@xmath0 @xcite and",
    "febr@xmath1 @xcite- 3d states form continuous energy spectrum wide in the energy by more than 15 ev .",
    "2 presents oversimplified crystal - field schemes from recent publications @xcite- we recognize these schemes as single - electron states with weak correlations . in contrary to band - theory results figure 2 suggests the existence of discrete 3d states but the electronic structure is only very schematic .",
    "the general shape of the bands presented in fig .",
    "1 can be understood knowing the localized states of fig .",
    "the continuous energy spectrum in the band picture looks like a smooth convolution on the available localized single 3d electron orbitals @xmath11 ( occupied ) and higher @xmath12 orbitals ( empty ) .",
    "the similarity of the band density of states and the energy level scheme of fig . 2 is related to the single - electron treatment of the 3d electrons in both approaches . in fig .",
    "3 we present the crystal - field states with strong electron correlations calculated by us - here the discrete energy states are many - electron states of the full co@xmath13 ion @xcite . in our approach",
    "we treat 3d electrons in the incomplete 3d shell as a forming atomic - like strongly - correlated system .",
    "our strongly - correlated crystal - field approach for the single 3d cation has been extended to the quantum atomistic solid state theory ( quasst ) @xcite in order to describe 3d - atom compounds .",
    "the revealed fundamental differences in the presented electronic structures are very important because this low - energy electronic structure determines physical properties of a real system .",
    "we claim that the states calculated by us are becoming to be more and more experimentally observed confirming our approach .",
    "the existence of such different electronic structures obviously proves the lack of a consensus in the understanding of 3d - atom compounds .",
    "there is general agreement that unusual magnetic and electronic properties of 3d - atom containing compounds and a failure of the standard band calculations are related to the improper treatment of electron correlations , that are apparently strong .",
    "thus , the problem about 3d - atom compounds can be formulated as `` how to account for strong correlations '' .",
    "however , the meaning of strong correlations is very unclear . in literature",
    "it is not clear if an author means on - site or inter - site electron correlations and which electrons are correlated . in an one gram of a solid",
    "there is @xmath14 atoms and say , 25 times more electrons . we feel that the strong electron correlations and strongly - correlated electron systems have not well defined physical meaning and are recalled in case of non - conventional magnetic and electronic properties .",
    "in fact they are recalled to hide our shortage of the knowledge and the understanding but the explanation sounds scientifically . with time we see , attending the annual strongly - correlated electron systems ( sces ) conferences and their proceedings published in physica b , that practically all compounds with 3d-/4f-/5f- open - shell atoms become at present classified as strongly - correlated electron systems . surely all 3d oxides are classified as strongly - correlated electron systems .    finally , one should note the energy scale on fig .",
    "3 , in particular that of the first excited state at 7 k ( = 0.6 mev=5 @xmath15 ) .",
    "it is at least 1000 times more detailed calculations than the present band calculations . by present computers we can perform such detailed calculations ,",
    "but the problem is whether such states and such tiny energy separations are preserved in a solid .",
    "developing the cef theory and tracing its effects by last 20 years we have been believing in the substantial applicability of the cef theory to solid compounds .",
    "we have evaluated a detailed electronic structure in rare - earth compounds with separations below 0.5 mev ( erni@xmath16 and ndni@xmath16 ( both are intermetallics ) @xcite , nd@xmath1cuo@xmath9 ( ionic ) @xcite ) but application of the cef theory to rare - earth compounds is more acceptable in the magnetic community .",
    "the usefulness of the cef theory to 3d compounds , even ionic , has been questioned in presently - in - fashion theories but such the detailed energy level scheme , as presented in fig .",
    "3 , has been recently revealed by electron - spin - resonance experiment to exist in lacoo@xmath0 @xcite confirming the presented theoretical approach . in doing our research",
    "we fully agree with a max planck saying , that `` experiments are the only means of knowledge at our disposal .",
    "the rest is poetry , imagination . ''",
    "very general aim of our long - lasting research is to describe macroscopically - observed physical properties of compounds containing open shell atoms , in particular with the 3d shell . some our research on rare - earth systems one can found in ref .",
    "@xcite where we successfully applied strongly - correlated crystal - field approach both for intermetallic and ionic compounds .    in this chapter",
    "we would like to present the strongly - correlated crystal - field approach for the description of electronic and magnetic properties of 3d - atom compounds , with taking into account the relativistic spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the strong electron correlations we account for by considering intra - site electron correlations at a given atom to be energetically dominant .",
    "these strong correlations assure the atomic - like integrity of the considered 3d atom in the well - defined ionic state even when this paramagnetic atom becomes the full part of a solid .",
    "we named this approach quantum atomistic solid - state ( quasst ) theory as its starting point for the analysis of a solid containing 3d atoms is the analysis of constituting atoms and their quantum discrete electronic structures in a given solid . here",
    "we confine our discussion to insulating 3d compounds - they are known as mott insulators .",
    "it was mott who pointed out that 3d oxides are insulators despite of having the open shell , violating in this way the conventional band theory of wilson and bloch .",
    "the mentioned above lacoo@xmath0 is an example of mott insulator belonging to the wide class of oxides with the perovskite structure . as an exemplary application of quasst to real compounds our analysis of febr@xmath1 and erni@xmath16",
    "can be advised @xcite .",
    "the former is an ionic compound whereas the latter is an intermetallic compound .",
    "we do not say that other mechanisms than cef and the spin - orbit coupling , after dominant coulombic interactions responsible for the cohesion of an ionic compound , are not present in a solid , but we are convinced that analysis of electronic and magnetic properties of 3d-/4f-/5f - atom compounds is necessary to start from the determination of the crystal - field interactions and of the localized cef - like states .",
    "we understand our theoretical research as a continuation of the van vleck s studies on the localized magnetism .",
    "we make use of efforts of many physicists and chemists of the solid state physics in order to construct a consistent understanding of electronic and magnetic properties of 3d-/4f-/5f - atom containing compounds and to correlate the macroscopically - observed properties with the atomic scale electronic structure .",
    "a key idea of quasst is that the paramagnetic ion in a solid largely preserves its atomic - like integrity , and consequently the atomic - like electronic structure , when it becomes the full part of a solid .",
    "this atomic - scale low - energy electronic structure predominantly determines the macroscopically observed magnetic and electronic properties of the whole compound .",
    "as we are interested in physical properties at room temperature and below we have to have the electronic structure to be determined below 25 mev ( = 300 k ) with the accuracy better than 1 mev .",
    "quasst is based on physical concepts well - known in solid - state physics , chemistry and material science . in quasst",
    "we incorporate the cef approach , the group theory , atomic physics , statistical physics , thermodynamics , the consideration of the local symmetry and many others forming a consistent theory for understanding of macroscopically - observed magnetic , electronic and spectroscopic properties of 3d-/4f-/5f - atom compounds in connection to the atomic - scale low - energy electronic structure of the involved atoms / ions .",
    "one can recognize in quasst traces of an ionic model , but we employ the crystal - field approach with strong correlations like shown in fig .",
    "3 . it contrasts single - electron crystal - field schemes , shown in fig . 2 , considered in the current literature .",
    "it turns out that most of physics of 3d magnetism lies in details of the low - energy electronic structure .",
    "the atomic - like integrity of the 3d electrons is pointed out by the writing of 3d@xmath17 configurations .      during the formation of a solid ,",
    "say an oxide , there proceeds a charge transfer from the paramagnetic cation to oxygen caused by the large chemical reactivity of oxygen and its large ability to capture two electrons from its surroundings . in case of nio , for instance , during the formation of the crystal two electrons from outer 4s+3d shells transfer to the oxygen completing its 2p shell .",
    "thus we have the charge distribution written as ni@xmath18o@xmath19 .",
    "an analysis of magnetic and electronic properties of nio we start from the discussion of properties of the ni@xmath18 ion in the crystalline solid as the oxygen has the closed 2p shell ( 2p@xmath20 ) .",
    "we do not expect low - energy states related to the oxygen .",
    "our interest concentrates on the low - energy electronic structure of the ni@xmath18 ion - in the ni@xmath18 ion there are 8 electrons which can be in the configuration 3d@xmath214s@xmath22 , 3d@xmath204s@xmath23 , 3d@xmath24 or a more complex depending on the invention of a scientist .",
    "there is a wide chemical evidence that with completing the atomic shells with electrons 3d shell is filled after the 4s shell whereas during the formation of a compound the 4s electrons are given back the first .",
    "so , thinking about the ni@xmath18 ion in oxides we start with the 3d@xmath24 configuration .",
    "the previous two configurations can lead to more metallic states , not realized in nio .    in lacoo@xmath0 , owing to its insulating ground state , we expect the charge ion valences as la@xmath13co@xmath13o@xmath0@xmath19 . in case of an intermetallic compound like erni@xmath16 or ndni@xmath16",
    "the situation is more complex but they can be analyzed as there localized electrons and itinerant electrons coexist . in case of erni@xmath16 or ndni@xmath16",
    "it has been proved that magnetic properties are related to the 4f@xmath25 and 4f@xmath26 configurations like in the er@xmath13 and nd@xmath13 ions , respectively .",
    "very good reproduction of the zero - temperature moment , overall temperature dependence of paramagnetic susceptibility @xmath10(t ) and of heat capacity c(t ) , including the magnetic transition proves the existence of the discrete atomic - like electronic structure with separations below 1 mev @xcite .",
    "the 3d@xmath24 configuration , according to the atomic physics , has @xmath27 states grouped in the russell - saunders terms ( the realization of the so - called ls coupling ) : term @xmath26f with 21-fold degeneracy , @xmath22d ( 5 ) , @xmath26p ( 9 ) , @xmath22 g ( 9 ) and @xmath22s ( 1 ) .",
    "the hund s rules ground term is @xmath26f term , that is described by quantum numbers of the whole 3d@xmath24 configuration s=1 and l=3 .",
    "these terms in a crystal are split and shifted , sometimes with the energetical reorganization , by the presence of the crystal - field potential but the integrity of the atomic - like 3d@xmath24 system is assumed in quasst to be preserved , at least at the start . in our description of the ion in a solid",
    "we start from the knowledge collected in the atomic physics , in particular in respect to the energy of terms and the intra - atomic spin - orbit coupling . here",
    "the data of nist atomic spectra database are of the great importance @xcite .    for the 3d@xmath20 configuration",
    "210 states are grouped in the atomic terms : @xmath28d ( 25 states ) , @xmath26h ( 33 ) , @xmath26 g ( 27 ) , 2@xmath29@xmath26f ( @xmath30 ) , @xmath26d ( 15 ) , 2@xmath29@xmath26p ( 2@xmath299 ) , @xmath22i ( 13 ) , 2@xmath29@xmath22 g ( 2@xmath299 ) @xmath22f ( 7 ) , 2@xmath29@xmath22d ( 2@xmath295 ) and 2@xmath29@xmath22s ( 2@xmath291 ) .",
    "the hund s rules term is 25-fold degenerate @xmath28d term , that is described by quantum numbers of the whole 3d@xmath20 configuration s=2 and l=2 .",
    "it is realized as the ground term in case of the free fe@xmath18 and co@xmath13 ions .      in a solid",
    "the states of the free ni@xmath18 ion are split and shifted . in a crystalline solid",
    "there is the electrostatic potential due to other charges forming the solid .",
    "this electrostatic potential is known as the crystal electric field and its effect on the paramagnetic ion is similar to the stark effect in atomic physics .",
    "however , the crystal field in solids has very multipolar character ( quadrupolar , octupolar , ... ) due to the regular three dimensional arrangement of charges in a solid .",
    "this multipolar character of the cef potential is hidden in the cef parameters b@xmath31 .",
    "the predominant cef potential in 3d oxides is the octupolar term - it is related to the octahedral crystal - field parameter denoted as b@xmath9 .    in our approach",
    "we make use of achievements about the crystal field reached in analysis of the electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) ( at present , the name electron spin resonance ( esr ) becomes more popular ) on paramagnetic ions put to solids as impurities @xcite .",
    "the splitting and the shift of the terms of 3d paramagnetic ions under the action of the cubic crystal field interactions have been calculated by tanabe and sugano already 50 years ago @xcite .",
    "unfortunately this knowledge is not used in presently - in - fashion band - like theories of 3d oxides .",
    "the presently - in - fashion theories of 3d oxides generally employ the strong crystal field approach that breaks completely intra - atomic correlations and starts the description of n electrons in the 3d shell as being largely independent . in the one - electron picture electrons",
    "are put subsequently on the five octahedral cef orbitals , with 10 places , on the t@xmath32 and e@xmath33 single - electron states .",
    "this subsequent placing is shown in fig .",
    "4 drawn with the use of ref @xcite fig.5.11 on p.150 ; ref .",
    "@xcite p.1049 ; refs @xcite .",
    "in quasst we apply the weak and intermediate crystal field regime , that does not break intra - atomic correlations , not only to 3d impurities , like is considered for the esr analysis , but to 3d atoms / ions when they become the full part of a solid .",
    "analysis of the crystallographic structure of many oxides reveals that the 3d cation is often surrounded by 6 oxygens forming almost regular octahedron or rarer by 4 oxygens forming a tetrahedron .",
    "the nacl structure of monoxides nio or feo is built up from the face sharing oxygen octahedra .",
    "the perovskite structure of lamno@xmath0 or lacoo@xmath0 is built up from the corner sharing octahedra .",
    "the oxygen octahedra , with the cu cation sitting inside , occur also in la@xmath1cuo@xmath9 , a parent compound of high - temperature superconductivity materials .",
    "thus the customary discussion of crystal - field effects in 3d compounds as related to the octahedral crystal field is largely justified but already here we would like to say that for the fully physically adequate description of 3d - atom compounds lattice distortions are very important and * all * , required by the local symmetry , terms in the crystal - field potential have to be taken into account .    the effect of the octupolar crystal - field interactions on the energy states of the hund s rules ground term is shown in figs 5b and 6b .",
    "the calculated states are states of the 3d@xmath17 electron configuration in the octahedral crystal field produced by the oxygen octahedron . in case of the tetrahedron the effect of the octupolar crystal field",
    "leads to the reversed schemes .",
    "having charge distribution in the elementary cell and consequently in the whole crystal , cef parameters can be calculated by formulas known from electrostatics as the respective multipolar moments of the surrounding charge distribution . by symmetry of the local surrounding",
    "only few multipolar moments are not zero .",
    "for instance , in case of the ligand ( = negative ions ) octahedron the only multipolar moment at the center of the octahedron is the octupolar lattice moment , denoted as cef coefficient a@xmath34 , which in cooperation with the octupolar ion moment provides the cef parameter b@xmath34 .",
    "the relativistic spin - orbit coupling is usually ignored in calculation of the electronic structure of the 3d ions in solids basing on a general consensus that the s - o coupling is for 3d ions relatively weak .",
    "we have , however , argued @xcite that such a thinking is incorrect - even weak s - o coupling causes dramatic change of the electronic structure by producing the fine electronic structure with a large number of low - energy states with separations even so small as 1 mev ( = 11.6 k = 8.0 @xmath15 ) .",
    "one can be surprised , but the influence of the spin - orbit coupling has not been systematically studied despite of a quite simple form of the s - o hamiltonian @xmath35 = @xmath36 .",
    "we have proved that the spin - orbit coupling has to be taken into account for any meaningful analysis of electronic and magnetic properties of 3d - ion compounds @xcite .",
    "the weaker spin - orbit coupling the more dramatic influence on the physical properties at low temperatures is produced .",
    "the influence of the spin - orbit coupling on the localized states of the strongly - correlated 3d@xmath37 electron system produced by crystal - field interactions of the octahedral symmetry is shown in figs 5c and 6c @xcite .      at zero temperature",
    "only the ground state is populated .",
    "the magnetic properties of the compound at t = 0 k are related to this atomic - like ground state .",
    "the states shown in figs 5c and 6c can be called the crystal - field or in general charged - formed ( cf ) ground state . in dependence of the magnetic characteristics of the ground state",
    "the ion moments can easier or more difficult enter into the game to create a collective magnetically - ordered state .",
    "a singlet cf ground state , in particular when there is a large energy separation to the excited states , largely prevents the formation of the magnetic state .",
    "it is worth noting that though magnetic state is the collective state its formation can be traced at the single - ion atomic scale as then there appears the breaking of the time - reversal symmetry in the atomic scale .",
    "this symmetry breaking the easiest is to be observed in case of the cf kramers doublet ground state for electronic configurations with an odd number of electrons ( d@xmath22 , d@xmath26 , d@xmath28 , d@xmath21 , d@xmath38 configurations ) .",
    "the kramers doublet is only split in the magnetic state and in presence of the magnetic field , internal or external .",
    "the formation of the magnetic state and a persistent non - magnetic state will be illustrated by two examples febr@xmath1 and lacoo@xmath0 .    with increasing temperature excited states",
    "become thermally populated .",
    "the population of states is described by the boltzmann statistics . having the states like those shown in figs 5c and 6c the helmholz free energy f(t )",
    "can be calculated by means of statistical physics .",
    "it enables calculations of all thermodynamical properties like temperature dependence of the heat capacity c(t ) , of the paramagnetic susceptibility @xmath10(t ) , of the charge quadrupolar ionic moment ( measured by the mossbauer spectroscopy ) and many others .",
    "also temperature dependence of the magnetic moment in the magnetically - ordered state can be calculated @xcite .",
    "quasst enables calculations of the anisotropy of physical properties .",
    "the paramagnetic susceptibility @xmath10(t ) , for instance , can be calculated along different crystallographic directions .",
    "in general , the hamiltonian for the whole compound like nio or febr@xmath1 could be written as : @xmath39 where h@xmath40 should treat intra - atomic whereas h@xmath41 inter - atomic interactions .",
    "h@xmath41 comprises , for instance , the energy between ni@xmath18 and o@xmath19 ions ( called the lattice madelung energy ) , that in case of an ionic compound like nio is dominant , but also much , much smaller energy between magnetic ionic moments leading to the magnetically - ordered state . the separation for intra and inter - atomic interactions is not strict as , for instance , the crystal - field energy , that is considered as the single - ion effect in fact is the coulombic charge multipolar interactions of the 3d cation with the charge multipolar moments of the surroundings .    in consideration of h@xmath40",
    "we assume the physical situation for the 3d@xmath37 system of a 3d - transition - metal ion to be accounted for by considering the single - ion - like hamiltonian containing the electron - electron d - d interactions @xmath42 , the crystal - field @xmath43 , spin - orbit @xmath35 , and zeeman @xmath44 interactions :    @xmath45    the electron - electron and spin - orbit interactions are intra - atomic interactions , whereas crystal - field and zeeman - like interactions account for interactions of the unfilled 3d shell with the charge and spin surroundings .",
    "these interactions are written in the decreasing strength succession .",
    "important is that we assume that h@xmath46 h@xmath47 .",
    "it is the essentially important to assume the dominant interactions to be h@xmath47 .",

    "the given term gather states with the same quantum numbers l and s and they are rather well separated from other terms .",
    "the ground term of the free atom / ion is determined by two phenomenological hund s rules , i.e. the lowest term of the whole 3d@xmath57 system is characterized by 1@xmath58 the maximal value of the resultant spin quantum number @xmath59 and 2@xmath60 ) the maximal value of the resultant orbital quantum number @xmath61 provided the condition 1@xmath60 .",
    "these rules yield for , for instance , the 3d@xmath62 and 3d@xmath20 electron configurations , the term @xmath63 with @xmath59 = 2 and @xmath61 = 2 as the ground term . this term is 25-fold degenerated in the spin - orbital space . in a solid other then hund s rules ground term can be realized as the ground term , like it occurs in lacoo@xmath0 and is shown in fig .",
    "figs 5 and 6 have been calculated for hund s rules ground terms .    in quasst",
    "we take into account on - site electron - electron correlations among d electrons by assuming that also for the ion in a solid the term structure is preserved .",
    "it does not mean at all that we claim that in a solid the term structure is exactly the same as in the free ion .",
    "the term structure in a solid differs from that of the free ion but we say that in calculations of the influence of the crystal - field potential and of magnetic interactions we should follow along well known from atomic physics interactions keeping the atomic - like integrity of the 3d@xmath17 system .",
    "the strong intra - atomic correlations allow to work with many - electron quantum numbers @xmath59 and @xmath61 of the whole 3d@xmath17 configuration instead of single - electron states with @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "in band structure calculations and in the single - electron crystal - field approach it is assumed that the atomic - like d - electron correlations have been broken and then the better starting point is to consider d electrons to be largely independent but experiencing separately the octahedral crystal field ( h@xmath66 h@xmath47 ) . in the consequence in the single - electron crystal - field approach electrons are put one by one on the five d orbitals determined by the octahedral crystal field ( three t@xmath32 states below and two e@xmath67 states higher ) . in such approach electron correlations are at the beginning absent and then they are introduced into calculations .    at beginning let assume that in a solid the ground term is the one given by phenomenological hund s rules .",

    "the effect of the crystal - field , of the spin - orbit coupling and of the ( internal / external ) magnetic field is accounted for by considering the single - ion hamiltonian of the 3d@xmath37 system of the 3d - transition - metal ion of the form : @xmath71 where @xmath49 denotes the one - term hamiltonian left after the dominant action of h@xmath47 .",

    "we are looking for for more physical and better - defined explanations , that we require , and we think that the smaller observed susceptibility can be caused by a zig - zag arrangement of the oxygen octahedra in the distorted perovskite structure ( co - o - co angle in lacoo@xmath0 is not 180@xmath125 but amounts to 163@xmath125 only @xcite ) but we would suggest that indeed only 1/3 of co ions contribute to the susceptibility observed at 100 k. it would require that local distortions distinguish co sites in a proportion 1 to 2 and that in the second sites the octahedral crystal field is larger yielding @xmath126@xmath127 , say , of 1000 k. it would cause that their contribution to @xmath10(t ) would be experimentally invisible .",

    "obviously the study of na@xmath1v@xmath0o@xmath141 at low temperatures is of large scientific interest - a magnetic ordering at ultra - low temperatures is discussed recently in terms of the quantum critical point .",
    "the crystal - field approach itself is usually considered as the single - ion approach and then arguments are given against its usefulness in the discussion of a real three dimensional ( 3d ) solid .",
    "we disagree with such a thinking and in order to point out the physical relevance of the cef concept to a solid the more general name , quantum atomistic solid state theory ( quasst ) , has been given .",
    "at first , it is important to notice that we consider in quasst not a single 3d cation but the cation in the octahedral surroundings , i.e. the complex mo@xmath142 . in the crystal",

    "we claim that the spin - orbital space is the physically proper space for 3d - ion compounds @xcite . for rare - earth systems",
    "the jahn - teller effect is discussed using the total angular momentum quantum number j as the good quantum number .",
    "such the j space of the three hund s rules ground multiplet is equivalent to the spin - orbital space , because j becomes the good quantum number as a result of the strong spin - orbit coupling , in fact infinitively strong .",
    "it means , that thanks taking into account the spin - orbit coupling in description of 3d ions we make the unification in description of the electronic structures of 3d and 4f ions and compounds .      in the quasst we point out that with decreasing temperature there appears more and more breaking symmetry mechanisms in order to remove the ground - state degeneracy and to increase the energy separation to the excited states .",
    "here we can mention a lowering of the local symmetry , the site differentiation and the formation of magnetic state .",
    "the magnetic state related to the time reversal symmetry breaking often appears with the lowering temperature . in case of the site differentiation instead of the single energy level scheme for the crystal ( what means , the same energy scheme at each 3d site ) we can have many energy schemes superimposed on each other originating from different sites .",
    "it could resemble a band .",
    "of course , the nature of this band is completely different from the band in the band theories . this band - like",
    "closely lying cef states are due to the site differentiation and a structural disorder . one should note that for the band formation the perfect translational symmetry is needed .",

    "there is clear distinction between the magnetically - ordered and the paramagnetic state . in the magnetic state",
    "the time reversal symmetry ( trs ) is broken .",
    "this trs breaking is possible to trace in the atomic scale as then appears the magnetic spin - like polarization of the eigenfunctions and states .",
    "the kramers doublets become split and then there appears a spin - like gap of a few mev size , depending on values of t@xmath144 ( t@xmath100 ) . in the magnetic state the mean value of the operator @xmath145@xmath146@xmath147@xmath148 in case of rare - earth ions and the mean values of @xmath145@xmath105@xmath147@xmath148 and @xmath145@xmath104@xmath147@xmath148 operators defining the total magnetic moment by ( @xmath104@xmath147+g@xmath149@xmath105@xmath147 ) , in case of iron - group ions , becomes different from zero .",
    "these values of the ground state do not have any direct connection to the effective moment derived from the paramagnetic susceptibility , that is a measure of @xmath146@xmath23 and @xmath105@xmath23 operators .",
    "in the paramagnetic state the time - reversal symmetry is preserved despite that the local moment is still described by quantum numbers s@xmath1500 and @xmath1510 .    in quasst",

    "it is worth noting that in quasst the overall c(t ) dependence is reproduced both in the absolute value and the @xmath83-type peak at t@xmath144 ( t@xmath100 ) .",
    "it is a surprise that already so simple mean - field hamiltonian , the third term in eqn ( 7 ) , provides so good reproduction of the @xmath83-type peak .",
    "one can think that the presented approach is too simple .",
    "surely it is , but the most important is that it is confirmed by experiment .",
    "so , the physics of solids could be complex , but it turns out that nature is not so complicated as could be .",
    "god is gracious to us !",
    "however , the evaluation of cef interactions , effects of the lowering symmetry with decreasing temperature , the site - to - site change of the quantum local z - axis ( so - called zig - zag alignment of octahedra in real perovskite compounds ) and a possible site differentiation with respect to the charge and local surroundings in cooperation with the spin - orbit coupling and magnetic interactions make the problem far from being easy to tackle for real compounds .",
    "it is the reason that though the concept of the crystal field is known already by 75 years there is a quite limited number of compounds in which cef interactions and magnetic interactions have been unambiguously evaluated . in particular , for 3d - atom containing compounds . in pointing out , in our presentation of quasst , of the importance of the atomistic description we would like to remind an obvious fact that it is atoms and ions that are the source of magnetism of solids .      in quasst",
    "we deal with many electron states and consequently with many - electron wavefunctions in contrary to single - electron states and single - electron wavefunctions considered in the band theories . in general , the wavefunction and the energy of the whole atomic - like 3d@xmath17 many - electron system of a given cation can be constructed from single - electron wavefunctions . in quasst",
    "it is in fact assumed that this many - electron construction from single - electron wavefunctions will lead to the atomic - like wavefunctions .",
    "other words , we think that the ambitious _ ab initio _ theories starting the description of a solid from a ( gaseous ) jellium of independent electrons have to put such conditions and introduce such mutual electron interactions into their theories in order to get atoms or given ions . in quasst",
    "we take the existence of atoms or ions as the physical fact that is not necessary to prove .",
    "their existence in the reality confirms the validity of our assumption .",
    "we treat the problem of description of atoms or ions as the subject of atomic physics .",
    "the states discussed in quasst are physical states - they can be experimentally observed by energy spectroscopic methods , like the inelastic neutron scattering , the light absorption , or the electron spin resonance .",
    "the existence of these states give physical effects like an extra heat capacity , quite pronounced for low - energy states giving a non - trivial schottky - like heat contribution at low temperatures , or a violation of the curie - weiss law at low temperatures .",
    "we point out the physical nature of the discussed states as in presently - in - fashion theories often virtual states and energy transitions of 2 - 5 ev are considered to give substantial physical effects below the room temperature .    in quasst",
    "the number of involved states is counted by the configurational entropy .",
    "this configurational entropy is experimentally measured by the integration of the heat capacity , after the substraction of the lattice heat .",
    "the presence of a large number of electronic states in energies below 25 mev is made use in the practice for magnetocaloric materials .",
    "the related entropy is freed at the magnetic ordering temperature .",
    "inspecting figs 5 and 6 we expect large magnetocaloric effect to occur for 3d ions in the octahedral voids for the mn@xmath13 ions - there entropy related to 10 lowest states can be freed .      within the quasst the insulating ground states of oxides",
    "is easily understood . after the charge transfer during the formation of a compound later",
    "electrons are bound to atoms .",
    "they are staying localized in case of the perfect stoichiometry and the perfect crystallographic structure . in oxides the conductivity appears as an effect of an imperfection of the crystal structure , off - stoichiometry , the appearance of vacancies and , in general , as disorder effects .",
    "there can appear the conductivity in perfect crystals in case of , for instance , the existence of few sites with ions with different valences .",
    "this latter case occurs in fe@xmath0o@xmath9 , in which fe@xmath18 and fe@xmath13 ions coexist at different crystal sites .",
    "thus , the conductivity in oxides is in general of the hopping mechanism and has the activation character .",
    "in lacoo@xmath0 the resistivity dramatically grows up with decreasing temperature reaching at 60 k already 10@xmath21 @xmath152 cm @xcite confirming that lacoo@xmath0 is the mott insulator despite of the existence of the incomplete 3d shell . with increasing temperature",
    "the resistivity smoothly drops reaching at about 700 k a value of 10@xmath122 @xmath152 cm which is a mott border - resistivity value for beginning of the metallicity .",
    "some people discuss this 10 order of magnitude reduction of the resistivity as an insulator - metal transition , though there only smooth crossover occurs with temperature .    in intermetallic compounds",
    "there are itinerant electrons , apart of bound localized electrons , as it was discussed for erni@xmath16 and ndni@xmath16 @xcite .      for description of thermodynamical properties in cef and quasst theories the boltzmann distribution function",
    "the pauli exclusion principle is made use in the description of particular atoms , i.e. in the description of electrons in shells , that appears in the allowed terms .",
    "the boltzmann distribution function is used for the calculation of thermodynamical properties because it describes the thermal equilibrium of the collection of atoms having available different energy states .",
    "rare - earth ions ( 4f ) are customarily described using j as the good quantum number @xcite .",
    "this the one - multiplet approximation gives physically adequate result because the spin - orbit coupling is large .",
    "due to the strong s - o coupling the ground multiplet is well separated from the exited multiplets .",
    "thus , the description within the ground multiplet , resulting from three hund s rules , is a justified approximation of calculations within the @xmath153lsl@xmath147s@xmath154 space .",
    "in contrast , 3d paramagnetic ions are customarily described , if not a one - electron approach is used , in the separate l and s spaces .",
    "it means , that the magnetic moment is the spin - only moment , whereas the electronic structure is built up from orbital states only . in our approach",
    "we describe both 4f and 3d paramagnetic ions within the same spin - orbital space @xmath153lsl@xmath147s@xmath154 .",
    "thus , quasst provides the unified description of 3d and 4f paramagnetic ions .",
    "as mentioned already , after very successful achievements of van vleck and his associates in years of 1929 - 1953 @xcite slater in 1953 @xcite came out with , according to stevens in a paper written in 1979 @xcite , p. 4 , a strong attack on the crystal field theory .",
    "the attack must have been really very strong as many researchers even very successful in the application of the cef theory to real systems drop the crystal - field ideas retaining , as stevens wrote @xcite , the spin - hamiltonian as an effective description only .",
    "the main objection of slater was that the crystal - field theory violates the physical principle of the indistinguishability of electrons . presenting slater s argument stevens wrote in ref .",
    "@xcite , p. 5",
    ", that by fact that in the cef theory we treat a single magnetic ion in a crystal lattice , say the nd@xmath13 ion for example , the electrons become distinguished by ascribing electrons 1 , 2 and 3 to the 4f shell and regarding all the others as simply constituting part of the electrostatic field . according to us this argument is not appropriate - * in the cef theory they are states but not electrons that become distinguished . * other argument of slater , also related to the electron indistinguishity principle , was that electrons are distinguished by ascribing them to the respective sites .",
    "again the slater s understanding of the electron indistinguishity principle is erroneous in case of solids - this ascribing of electrons is to the atoms and the electrons are localized being bound to its original atom .",
    "one could say , remembering a term of slave bozons popular in modern solid - state theory , that electrons in cef and in quasst are slaves of atoms .",
    "later questioning of cef in seventies of xx century was by freeman @xcite , pp 321 - 327 , for the inability to calculate exactly cef parameters .",
    "there was no doubt that author of ref .",
    "@xcite favors the band theory .",
    "we think that the inability argument should be taken as critics of a detail of the cef theory , like point - charge approximation , rather than the cef theory itself .",
    "according to freeman other environmental effects , overlap and covalency should have much bigger effect on the crystal - field splitting than the electrostatic field description .",
    "we could only very partly agree with this point but simultaneously we would like to point out that a freeman s 30-year - old hope that the band theory _ ab initio _ soon solve the description of magnetic and electronic properties still awaits for the realization . as far as exact calculations of cef parameters are discussed we would like to say that all cef interactions , in particular for rare - earth compounds that have been of the freeman interest , are of very small energies , say of 10 mev .",
    "it is at least 2 - 3 orders of magnitude weaker than potentials discussed in the band theory .",
    "thus , we prefer to reverse this scientific problem - the evaluation of the low - energy electronic structure and its parametrization by means of * cef parameters can be used for the evaluation of the charge distribution in the elementary cell*. in such the methodology we use , in fact , 3d/4f/5f cations as a microscopic probe for the existence of the crystal - field multipolar potentials in a solid .",
    "such the evaluation is only possible provided the full energy level scheme is perfectly established .",
    "the full scheme , not only the ground state , is needed for the meaningful evaluation of different multipolar contributions .",
    "moreover , we would like to point out that the cef theory and quasst reveal the need of 0.5 mev accuracy in the evaluation of the electronic structure .",
    "it is 1000 times more exact than the presently attained accuracy of band - structure calculations .",
    "the questioning of the crystal - field theory has caused that today , despite of the fact , that there is continuously growing number of compounds described in terms of the cef hamiltonian the crystal - field theory itself , often identified with the shortage of the point - charge model , is often regarded as `` naive '' .",
    "we fully disagree with a statement of freeman @xcite , p. 322",
    ", that `` the success of this naive ( and from the theoretical point of view inadequate ) model is thought to lie in the fact that v@xmath144 gives the hamiltonian the correct symmetry and a sufficient number of empirical parameters which somehow absorb all the various environmental effects not included in the simple description given by eqn ( 6.49 ) '' , i.e. by a cef potential expanded in terms of spherical functions .    other aspect of the problem of a disdainful treatment of the crystal field is related to the education - students of physics are not taught , or only very little , of the crystal field and of the group theory .",
    "a basic message of the quasst is that the low - energy discrete electronic structure of the atomic - like 3d@xmath17 configuration , determined by crystal - field and spin - orbit interactions , is largely preserved in a solid 3d - atom containing compound . according to us *",
    "the theoretical basis for the crystal - field theory is the atomistic construction of matter * and we are very surprised that it was not recognized earlier .",
    "the atomistic construction of matter is the basic well - established principle of nature - one could say that this knowledge is already known from 2 500 years , thinking about loosely ideas of democritos , another one , that from 100 years , when atoms have been accepted in physics to exist in the reality ( 1913 - bohr s model for the hydrogen ) .",
    "thus we are fully convinced that the crystal field and quasst theory are based on well - known and well - established physical concepts , like the local symmetry , the group theory , atomic physics with stark and zeeman effects , statistical physics and many others .",
    "the crystal field and quasst theory discuss the discrete states , the existence of which is a characteristic feature of the quantum mechanics .",
    "in such the formulation quasst can be experimentally verified and , as carl popper says in the scientific methodology , it can be falsificated .",
    "the falsification possibility is the basic requirement , according to popper , demanded for a scientific theory .",
    "we are ready for the open scientific discussion about the physically adequate description of the electronic structure and the magnetism of 3d-/4f-/5f - atom containing compounds .",
    "we are convinced that the cef theory not only provides a conceptually simple framework for the interpretation of numerous experimental results , as many people are ready to accept the crystal field approach , but the cef theory must be a basic ingredient of each modern solid state theory dealing with electronic and magnetic properties of transition - metal compounds .",
    "quasst reconciles the cef theory with localized moments with the lattice periodicity , a problem , that according to stevens @xcite , p. 7 , has divided magneticians for many years .",
    "in quasst d electrons take part both in the bonding and in the magnetism . the primary bonding proceeds via electrostatic interactions .",
    "the magnetic interactions , in fact spin - dependent interactions , responsible for the formation of the magnetically - ordered state are much weaker than coulombic interactions and are of order of t@xmath144(t@xmath100)/k@xmath86 , i.e. of , say , 30 mev .    in quasst the magnetic moment",
    "is associated with the open - shell atoms .",
    "quasst enables calculations of both the spin and orbital moments @xcite .",
    "there is rapidly growing experimental evidence for the existence of the orbital moment , thanks x - ray synchrotron experiments , and quasst enables its calculation using well - established physical concepts .",
    "the used home - made computer program birec for 3d is available on our web - side : http://www.css-physics.edu.pl .",
    "quasst nicely illustrates that the whole magnetism is the macroscopic quantum effect .",
    "quasst offers a solution of the mott - insulator problem - an 3d oxide is the insulator having bound electrons in the incomplete 3d shell , that govern magnetic , electronic and spectroscopic properties .",
    "quasst bridges the atomic physics and the solid - state physics .    in frame of quasst low - energy excitations are neutral spin - like excitations between cef - like d states .",
    "according to quasst these neutral low - energy spin - like excitations , between two kramers conjugate states cause anomalous behavior of some ce , yb and u compounds at low temperatures known as heavy - fermion phenomena .",
    "our approach is in agreement with a general idea of mott that it is strong electron correlations in 3d oxides that make electrons in the incomplete 3d shell to stay rather localized than itinerant .",
    "we are convinced that there is no other nowadays theory of a solid containing transition - metal atoms that can describe properties in so detailed and in so consistent way , both zero - temperature properties and thermodynamics with the physically clear distinction of the magnetically - ordered and paramagnetic states .",
    "the quasst basic message can be defined also in a way that for the physically adequate description of electronic and magnetic properties of 3d-/4f-/5f-/atom compounds the cef interactions , completed with the intra - atomic - spin - orbit coupling , have to be determined the first .",
    "one can ask :  is this atomistic idea a new one in the solid - state physics ?  yes and no .",
    "no , as most of experimentalists naturally discuss their results in terms of local properties .",
    "yes , as according to our knowledge none has been able to resist to presently - in - fashion solid - state physics theories that simply ignore the existence of the atom in a solid arguing that a solid is so many - body object and that there are so strong intersite correlations that the individuality of atoms is lost . in the standard band - structure calculations the f and",
    "d electrons are taken as itinerant forming a band . in the band",
    "there is a continuum of the energy states within 1 - 5 ev . in our model",
    "there are discrete states with energy separations even less than 1000 times smaller ( 1 mev , but 0 in case of kramers ions ) .",
    "no , as there are some text - books written about the crystal field , let mention a book of abragam and bleaney @xcite , of ballhausen @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "yes , as they applied the cef approach to some diluted 3d systems , not to the concentrated ones , i.e. not to a crystalline solid .",
    "yes , as they have not been consequent enough and they largely washed up the original idea .",
    "yes , as there are still very popular text - books and review articles that show very schematic description of 3d states @xcite making use of the single - electron picture .",
    "one should note that in the strong cef approach the n 3d electrons are treated as largely independent , i.e. they do not form the strongly - correlated 3d@xmath17 system in contrary to quasst .",
    "quasst corresponds to the intermediate ( 3d ) or weak ( 4f ) crystal - field approach , but we point out the fundamental importance of the intra - atomic spin - orbit coupling , despite of its relative weakness for the 3d ions . also yes , as at present this atomic - like picture is enormously prohibited in the leading physical journals and a little is said about the discrete states at the magnetic and annual strongly - correlated electron system ( sces ) conferences .",
    "we would like to add , preceding unfounded critics , that we do not claim that everything can be explained only by single atoms but our point is that the proper , i.e. physically adequate starting point for the discussion of properties of a solid containing the open - shell atoms is the consideration of its atomic - like states in the local surroundings , i.e. in the lattice crystal field .",
    "our numerous computer experiments point out that e.g. the orbital moment has to be unquenched in the solid - state physics of 3d - ion containing compounds and our approach enables it . for instance",
    ", we have derived the orbital moment in nio to be 0.54 @xmath101 what amounts to 20 % of the total moment ( 2.53 @xmath101 ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , one should not consider our approach as the treatment of an isolated atom - we start the discussion of nio from the consideration of the cation octahedra nio@xmath155 ( more exactly - the ni@xmath18 ion in the octahedral crystal field ) .",
    "the whole nacl structure of nio is built up from the edge sharing cation octahedra .",
    "the perovskite structure , for instance , is built up from the corner ( and the edge ) sharing cation octahedra along the c direction ( in the a - b plane ) .",
    "thus , such octahedra cover the whole macroscopic 3d body provided the perfect translational symmetry .",
    "the cef parameters contain information about the interaction of the single ion with the whole charge surroundings .",
    "our approach is in agreement with the general conviction about the importance of the electron correlations in description of open - shell compounds - in our approach we start from the very strongly - correlated limit in contrary to a weak correlation limit of the lsda approach .    for the better illustration of our point of view the reader",
    "is asked to look into recent phys .",
    "lett . papers . in ref .",

    "other words , ambitious solid - state theories starting the description of a 3d solid from a ( gaseous ) jellium of independent electrons must put such conditions and such potentials and mutual electron interactions into their theories in order to get 3d atoms or 3d ions and to reproduce the spectral term structure , known from the atomic physics . in quasst",

    "the single - ion prediction of the variation of the b@xmath9 parameter enables study of cef interactions across the whole isostructural series and somehow to predict physical properties of a compound knowing the local symmetry and the involved cation .",
    "the reversal of the electronic structure for the ni@xmath18 and co@xmath18 ions ( @xmath161 and @xmath162 configurations ) have been noticed already by van vleck @xcite .",
    "although the calculated _ ab initio _ value of the b@xmath9 parameter in lacoo@xmath0 for the nearest oxygen octahedron , see section 4.2 , is eight times smaller than the recent evaluation of 260 k it is extremely important that this _ ab initio _ calculation provides the proper sign of b@xmath9 parameter because this sign determines the ground state in the oxygen octahedron .",
    "there is a hope that taking into calculations all charges and other physical effects bridges both values .",
    "however , we point out that by the recent experimental evaluation of the strength of crystal - field interactions it turns out that the commonly used strong crystal - field approach , with breaking the atomic - like correlations , is not justified .",

    "7 show .      of course",
    ", the quasst calculations should be performed within all - terms space involving the @xmath48 states allowed by the pauli principle .",
    "of course , it would be better to take into consideration all interactions known to exist in a solid .",
    "however , more parameters more difficult to get physically adequate results is .",
    "physics is the science of approximations - the most important is to catch the most essential physical ingredient(s ) and made only physically proper approximations .",
    "we are convinced that * by taking into account the atomic physics and the spin - orbit coupling we have caught the most essential physical ingredients .",
    "surely we have the physically adequate number of states involved in the low - energy electronic structure * like it was shown for febr@xmath1 . for the v@xmath129 ion in na@xmath1v@xmath0o@xmath2",
    "there is only one term , @xmath23d .",
    "thus calculations for the d@xmath22 configuration for the v@xmath129 and ti@xmath13 ions are equivalent to all - terms calculations .",
    "the performing all - terms calculations , provided that there is no term reorganization as occurs in lacoo@xmath0 , will lead to only small changes in energies and eigenfunctions compared to hund s rules ground term calculations , but the number of electronic states will be preserved .",
    "it is important as the number of available low - energy states determines the overall behavior of thermodynamical properties , like the total entropy . in lacoo@xmath0",
    "the subterm reorganization occurs and the @xmath22a@xmath118 subterm becomes the ground subterm , but it proceeds in the fully - controlled and in the fully - understood way .",
    "thus , all - terms calculations do not introduce changes in the physical description of properties in comparison to the one - term calculation .",
    "it is in contrast to the revolutionary change of physics going from the orbital - only states to the spin - orbit states discussed in the strongly - correlated crystal - field approach and in quasst .",
    "but it is nature that chooses the physically adequate approach .",
    "we hope that the discrete states also are present in 4d-/5d - atom containing compounds . calculated electronic structure for the ru@xmath129 ion in sr@xmath1ruo@xmath9 has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in 4d and 5d ions",
    "the spin - orbit coupling is much stronger that in case of 3d ions .",
    "the j - j coupling should be rather more applicable than the russell - saunders coupling used for the description of 3d ions .",
    "the substantial applicability of the strongly - correlated cef approach to 5f - atom compounds have been demonstrated for upd@xmath1al@xmath0 , uga@xmath1 and npga@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "magnetic and electronic properties of upd@xmath1al@xmath0 and uga@xmath1 turn out to be related to the 5@xmath164 configuration like in the u@xmath13 ion .",
    "accepting the cef and quasst theory one can say that the crystalline solid provides the wide possibility to study the stark and zeeman effect on paramagnetic ions , their discrete states , in very complicated multipolar electrostatic fields and in extremal magnetic fields , unavailable presently in the laboratory .    in deriving the states , their energy and eigenfunction , an important problem of the atomic physics , the applicability of the russell - saunders or j - j coupling can be effectively studied . from this point of view the perfect description of the g tensor of the co@xmath13 ion @xcite and the behavior of its localized states observed in the esr experiment on single crystalline lacoo@xmath0 in magnetic fields up to 30 t along different crystallographic directions we take to be of a remarkable scientific importance .",
    "it is also very important from the unification point of view that the single - ion hamiltonian widely used in the analysis of electron - paramagnetic resonance spectra of 3d - ion doped systems has been successfully used for systems , where the 3d atoms are the full part of the crystal .",
    "we have presented the crystal - field approach with strong electron correlations , extended to the quantum atomistic solid - state theory ( quasst ) , as a physically relevant theoretical model for the description of electronic and magnetic properties of 3d - atom compounds .",
    "its applicability has been illustrated for lacoo@xmath0 , febr@xmath1 and na@xmath1v@xmath0o@xmath2 . according to the quasst theory in compounds containing open 3@xmath3-/4@xmath4-/5@xmath4-shell atoms the discrete atomic - like low - energy electronic structure survives also when the 3d atom becomes the full part of a solid matter .",
    "this low - energy atomic - like electronic structure , being determined by local crystal - field interactions and the intra - atomic spin - orbit coupling , predominantly determines electronic and magnetic properties of the whole compound .",
    "it should not mean that other mechanisms than cef and the spin - orbit coupling are not present in a solid , but we are convinced that analysis of electronic and magnetic properties of 3d-/4f-/5f - atom compounds is necessary to start from the determination of the crystal - field interactions and of the localized cef - like states .",
    "we understand our theoretical research as a continuation of the van vleck s studies on the localized magnetism .",
    "we point out , however , the importance of the orbital magnetism and the intra - atomic spin - orbit coupling for the physically adequate description of real 3d - ion compounds .",
    "our studies clearly indicate that it is the highest time to  unquench  the orbital moment in solid - state physics in description of 3d - atom containing compounds .",
