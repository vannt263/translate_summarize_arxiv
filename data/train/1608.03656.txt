    "emotions have a substantial effect on human decision - makings and behaviors  @xcite . emotions also transfers between different individuals through their communications and interactions , indicating that emotion contagion , which make others around experience the similar emotional statuses , could possibly promote social interactions  @xcite and synchronize collective behavior , especially as the individuals are embedded in social networks  @xcite . from this perspective , better understanding of the emotion contagion can essentially help upgrade emotion management and disclose collective behavior patterns .",
    "however , the detailed mechanism of emotion contagion in context of the social network still remains unclear .",
    "conventional approaches like laboratory experiments are pervasively employed to testify the existing of emotion contagion in realistic circumstances  @xcite . however , to unravel the detailed mechanism beyond the emotion contagion is much more challenging .",
    "it is hard for the controlled experiments to establish a large social network , stimulate different emotions simultaneously and then track the propagation of emotions in real - time .",
    "meanwhile , in order to study the coupled dynamics between the social structure and emotion contagion , properties like relationship strengths should be considered , while which might further import uncontrolled contextual factors and fundamentally undermine the reliability of the experiment .",
    "we argue that it is extremely difficult for conventional approaches to investigate the spread mechanism in the context of large social network and long - term observation , and the footprints of natural affective responses from massive individuals in online social media indeed offer us a new and computational perspective  @xcite .",
    "it is not easy to differentiate online interactions from face - to - face communication in terms of emotion contagion  @xcite .",
    "more and more evidence from both facebook and twitter in recent years consistently demonstrates the existing of emotion contagion in online social media  @xcite .",
    "kramer et al .",
    "for the first time provide the experimental evidence of emotion contagion in facebook by manipulating the amount of emotional content in the news feed  @xcite .",
    "later ferrara and yang disclose the evidence of emotion contagion in twitter  @xcite . instead of controlling the content , they measure the emotional valence of the content and show that posting positive and negative tweets both follow significant over - exposures , indicating the spread of different feelings . evidence from both studies",
    "suggests that even in the absence of non - verbal cues of in - person interactions  @xcite , emotions like positive and negative feelings can still transfer from one user to others in online social media .",
    "in fact , through posting , reposting and other virtual interactions , users in online social media express and expose their natural emotional states into the social network in real - time as the context evolves . hence being an ubiquitous sensing platform",
    ", the online social media collects emotion expression and dissemination in the most realistic and comprehensive circumstance and thus provides us an unprecedented proxy to obtain universal insights of the underlying mechanism of emotion contagion in social network .",
    "however , in the previous study , emotions in online social media are usually simplified into the positive and the negative  @xcite and many fine - grained emotional states , especially the negative ones like anger and disgust are neglected .",
    "in fact , negative feelings like anger on the internet might greatly dominate online bursts of societal issues or terrorist attack and play essential roles in driving the collective behavior during the event propagation  @xcite .",
    "aiming at fill this vital gap , in this paper , we categorize the human emotion into four categories  @xcite , including joy , anger , disgust and sadness and try to disclose the mechanism underlying their spread .",
    "fine - grained emotional states enrich the landscape of emotion contagion and make it possible to systematically understand the underlying mechanisms between social structures and propagation dynamics .    in this paper",
    ", we employ over 11 million tweets posted by around 100 thousand users of a half year in weibo , a variant of twitter in china to perform the computational and quantificational investigation of emotion contagion .",
    "surprisingly , we find that among the four emotions we study , joy and anger demonstrate significant evidence of contagion and anger is the most contagious mood , indicating that under the same volume of exposure , angry messages will sparkle more follow - up retweets or tweets than joy in the near future .",
    "besides , from the view of coupled dynamics with the social structure , different measures of relationship strengths consistently show that anger prefers weaker ties than joy in the dissemination , indicating that angry tweets can break local traps and arrive the global coverage with greater odds .",
    "we conjecture that easier contagion and weaker ties could make anger spread faster than joy in online social media , then over 40 million tweets from 616 online bursts in china further solidly testify this argument . in these sudden events",
    ", we find that negative ones with anger as the dominating emotion arrives their diffusion peaks with shorter intervals and higher velocities than joyful counterparts .",
    "our findings about the emotion contagion will be insightful for personal anger management and collective behavior understanding in realistic scenarios either online or offine .",
    "in this study , 11,753,609 tweets posted by 92,176 users from sept .",
    ", 2014 to mar .",
    ", 2015 are collected , including the following network of these users . through a bayesian classifier trained in  @xcite",
    ", each emotional tweet in our data set can be automatically labeled to joy , anger , disgust or sadness",
    ". then the diffusive probability and structure preferences are accordingly investigated in the social network of around 100 thousand subjects .",
    "finally the realistic bursts in weibo will be employed to testify the conjecture that anger spreads faster than joy , in which 40,005,242 tweets of 616 different events are employed to perform the computational analysis  .      rather than manipulating the content users receive  @xcite , we measure the emotion contagion through the extent to which a user will be influenced emotionally by the tweets she received in weibo during a certain period , i.e. , an observation window . similar to  @xcite , it is assumed that the emotion that users are exposed to in the recent past will stimulate similar emotional status and which can be reflected by users newly posted tweets .",
    "each individual in weibo can be embedded into a online social network with nodes being users and directed links being following relationships , for example , if a user @xmath0 ( follower ) follows a user @xmath1 ( followee ) , a tie will be established from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , indicating that tweets posted by @xmath1 will be flooded to @xmath0 in real - time .",
    "supposing the observation window is @xmath2 hours , a vector @xmath3 represents the emotion distribution of tweets exposed to @xmath0 within @xmath2 before posting the tweet @xmath4 . note that we omit the tweets with total exposure less than 20 tweets to ensure the reliability of the measurement . by averaging over each dimension of all tweets exposure vectors ,",
    "a vector @xmath5 can be obtained to reflect the baseline of emotion distribution before any tweet is posted in weibo . while for a certain emotion @xmath6 ( @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) , by averaging over each dimension of all tweets with emotion @xmath6 , a vector @xmath9 is similarly obtained to stand for the average emotion distribution before any tweet with emotion @xmath6 is posted in weibo .",
    "then for emotion @xmath6 , the difference ( denoted as @xmath10 ) on dimension @xmath6 between @xmath5 and @xmath9 can intuitively reflect the contagion tendency , i.e. , the significance of contagion , of @xmath6 in weibo .",
    "higher @xmath10 implies that emotion @xmath6 will stimulate more tweets with the same emotion in the near future than the average level , suggesting it is more contagious from the perspective of emotional influence .     hours . ]    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : contagion](a ) , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are significantly higher than that of other emotions , which indicates that both emotions can spread in the social network , especially for anger which possesses the highest significance as compared to the baseline .",
    "for example , @xmath11 is about 2.1% when @xmath13 , which means that users received 2.1% more angry tweets than ordinary time before they post an angry message .",
    "however , the significance of contagion is relatively low for disgust and sadness , especially for disgust , suggesting the possibility of contagion is trivial . because of this ,",
    "in the following content we only focus on anger and joy .",
    "note that @xmath10 also decrease as @xmath2 grows , because the influence of the emotion decays with time and thus users are easier to be influenced by messages they received in more recent hours , which is consistent with our intuition . while even @xmath2 grows , anger persistently shows the most significant difference , indicating that it is more contagious than joy and is a stronger stimuli in emotion expression of human in the social network .",
    "emotion influence is closely entangled with emotion contagion .",
    "when emotion spread in the social network , connected individuals could influence each other emotionally and later might lead to the clustering of emotion , i.e. , networked individuals demonstrate homophily in sentimental statuses .",
    "for example , bollen et .",
    "al find that happiness of users is assortative across twitter  @xcite and bliss et .",
    "al reveal that average happiness scores are positively correlated between friends within three hops  @xcite . particularly , fan et .",
    "al even show that in weibo anger possesses stronger correlation than joy for friends within three hops , suggesting that anger is more influential than joy  @xcite .",
    "inspired by this , similar to the metric presented in  @xcite , here we also evaluate the contagion tendency of anger and joy from the perspective of emotion influence .",
    "for each tweet @xmath4 with emotion @xmath6 posted by @xmath0 , we calculate the euclidean distance @xmath14(@xmath15 or 4 ) between @xmath16 and @xmath17(@xmath15 or 4 ) .",
    "we define @xmath4 is an emotionally influenced tweet , i.e. , @xmath4 is stimulated by emotion @xmath6 carried by tweets that @xmath0 received within @xmath2 if the emotion with the smallest distance is @xmath6 .",
    "then for anger and joy , the one with higher percentage of influenced tweets will be more influential and contagious . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contagion](b ) , anger possesses the higher percentage of influenced tweets than joy , indicating that as compared to joy , it is easier to be stimulated by tweets that users are exposed to .",
    "meanwhile , as @xmath2 grows both emotions influenced percentages increase because users are exposed to more tweets when @xmath2 is large , while anger persistently possesses the higher percentage than joy and the gap is even enlarged for greater @xmath2 .",
    "we further investigate the emotion contagion from the view of emontionally influenced users .",
    "specifically , all users are sorted in the descending order of the percentage of their influenced tweets , i.e. , the faction of influenced tweets in their tweeting timelines .",
    "the top and bottom 15% users are then defined as the high susceptible and the low susceptible , respectively . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : contagion_users ] , low susceptible users are easier to be affected by anger while high susceptible users are more inclined to be stimulated by joy .",
    "different from  @xcite , in which it is claimed that both high and low susceptible users are more susceptible to positive feelings than the negative , however , our results demonstrate that in fact anger , one of the negative emotions , is more susceptible than joy for low susceptible users .",
    "it means that a fine - grained emotion category can lead to new insights in discussing the emotion contagion and anger , out of expectation , is more contagious than joy .",
    "meanwhile , relatively lower number of followers for the low susceptible user indicates its higher occupation than the high susceptible in the soical network and given the power - law like distribuiton of the number of followers , it is further suggested that anger is more contagious for the majority of the social network that joy .",
    "being more contagious and more susecptible to the majority indicate that anger could be transfered faster than joy , because it will inspire more follow - up tweets under the same intensity of stimuli .",
    "however , the mechanism underlying emotion contagion also relies heavily on structure of the social network and thus how structure functions on contagion of joy and anger indeed deserves further explorations .",
    "the dynamics of emotion contagion is essentially coupled with the underlying social network that providing channels for disseminating the sentiment from one individual to others . except the willingness of posting an angry or joyful tweet after exposed to anger or joy from followees , another key factor that determines",
    "the user s action is that on which relationship the contagion will happen with higher likelihood .",
    "specifically , the prediction of which friend will retweet the emotional post in the future will be insightful for the contagion modeling and control .",
    "the social relationship , or the tie in social network , can be measured by its strength , which is instrumental for spreading both online and real - world human behaviors  @xcite . the strength of a tie in online social media can be intuitively measured through online interactions , i.e. , retweets , between its two ends . here",
    "three metrics are presented to depict tie strengths quantificationally .",
    "the first one is the proportion of common friends  @xcite , which is defined as @xmath18 for the tie between users @xmath6 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number of common friends , @xmath21 and @xmath22 represent degrees of @xmath6 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "note that for the metric of common friends , the social network of weibo is converted to undirected with each link representing the possible interaction between both ends .",
    "the second metric is inspired by the reciprocity in twitter - like services and higher ratio of reciprocity indicates more trust and more significant homophily  @xcite .",
    "hence for a pair of users , the proportion of reciprocal retweets in the total flux between them is defined as the tie strength .",
    "the third metric is the number of reweets between two ends of a tie in weibo and greater values stand for more frequent interactions .",
    "note that different from the previous two metrics , the retweet strength is time - evolving and we only count the retweets happening before the corresponding emotional retweet . and in order to smooth the comparison between anger and joy , the retweet strength , denoted as @xmath23 , is also normalized by @xmath24 , in which @xmath25 and @xmath26 separately represent the minimum and maximum values in all obervations .            by investigating each emotional retweet , i.e. , reposting an angry or joyful tweet posted by the followee",
    ", we correlate emotion contagion with tie strengths . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : weak_tie ] , all the metrics consistently demonstrate that anger prefers weaker ties than joy in contagion , suggesting that angry tweets spread through weak ties with greater odds than the joyful ones . it is well known that weak ties play essential roles in diffusion of social networks  @xcite , especially in break the local trap caused by communities in terms of bridging different clusters together  @xcite .",
    "for example , a typical snapshot of emotion contagion with four communities are demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] , in which anger disseminates through more weak ties of inter - communities than joy .",
    "because of this , as compared to joy , anger has more chances to penetrate different communities through its preference on weak ties in emotion contagion . and more communities lead to more global coverage , indicating that anger could reach broader dissemination than joy over the same time period .",
    "both evidence from contagion tendency and relationship strength suggests that anger could spread faster than joy , because it will stimulate more follow - up tweets and penetrate more communities in the social network of weibo .",
    "next direct evidence from online bursts in weibo will be demonstrated to testify this conjecture further .",
    "no moods are created equally online  @xcite , the difference in contagion of positive and negative feelings is a trending but controversial topic for years .",
    "berger and milkman reveal that more positive content is more viral than negative content in study of ny times  @xcite .",
    "tadi and uvakov find that for human - like bots in online social network , positive emotion bots are more effective than the negative ones  @xcite .",
    "even claim that bad news containing more negative words fades more rapidly in twitter  @xcite . while chmiel et .",
    "al point out that negative sentiments boost user activity in bbc forum  @xcite .",
    "pfitzner et .",
    "al state that users tend to retweet tweets with high emotional diversity  @xcite . ferrara and yang",
    "demonstrate that though people are more likely to share positive content in twitter , negative messages spread faster than positive ones at the level of contents  @xcite .",
    "thus hansen et al .",
    "conclude that the relation between emotion and virality is much complicated  @xcite .",
    "here we argue that fine - grained division of human emotion , especially the negative , will enrich the background of investigating the contagion difference . and",
    "in the meantime , explicit definitions of fast spread will further facilitate the elimination of debates on this issue",
    ".     evolves .",
    "( b ) examples of locating the awakening and the peak for both anger and joy dominated events .",
    "@xmath27 denotes the instant of awakening , @xmath28 denotes the peaking time and @xmath29 and @xmath30 stand for the volume of emotional tweets at the instants of awakening and peak , respectively .",
    "the slope of the line ( blue ) between points @xmath31 and @xmath32 can reflect the averaged velocity . ]    over 600 bursty events are extracted from weibo and for each event , the emotion occupying more than 60% emotional tweets will be defined as the dominant emotion of the event . in total",
    "we get 37 anger - dominated events and 200 joy - dominated events , as can be seen fig .  [",
    "fig : event](a ) , in which the volume of emotional tweets fluctuates with time and anger takes over the majority . for an online burst , the fast spread means the volume of emotional tweets grow quickly in the period from the awakening instant to the diffusion peak . through a parameterless approach presented in  @xcite",
    ", we can precisely locate the instant of awakening and peak .",
    "then how fast the spread is can be reflected by the interval between the awakening and the peak ( shorter intervals suggest faster spread ) or the averaged velocity of the growth in diffusion from awakening to the peak ( higher velocities indicate faster spread ) . specifically , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : event](b ) , regarding to interval , @xmath33 can reflect how fast the spread is , while with respect to averaged velocity , it can be defined as the slope , i.e. , @xmath34 and for both measures higher values suggest faster spread .",
    "the averaged results over all anger and joy dominated events are listed in table  [ tab : speed ] and it can be seen that both metrics testify significantly that anger - dominated events incline to arrive the peak from the awakening more quickly than joy .",
    "we can conclude that anger indeed spreads faster than the joy in social media like weibo .",
    ".averaged values over all anger and joy dominated events .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "bad is always stronger than good  @xcite . from the previous studies",
    ", it is profoundly disclosed that anger is more influential than joy in weibo  @xcite and the negative contents in twitter spread faster than positive ones  @xcite . however , in this study , by finely splitting the negative feelings into anger , disgust and sadness , we for the first time offer the empirical evidence that anger spreads faster than joy in social media , implying that anger on the internet should be considered primarily in either personal emotion management or collective mood understanding .",
    "the way how anger is expressed and experienced on the internet is arousing attention .",
    "it has been found from self - reports of rant - site visitors that posting anger produces relaxed feelings immediately  @xcite , which makes posting anger an effective way of self - regulation in mood .",
    "however , considering the easy contagion of anger , more angry expressions on the internet might arouse negative shifts in mood of the crowd that connected to posters  @xcite .",
    "moreover , anger s preference of weak ties will make it likely to spread to `` strangers '' in the internet .",
    "the users want to ease anger by posting on the internet should be suggested to underhand the possible impact to their online social network . even in offline scenario , like the `` road rage ''  @xcite at rush hours of china ,",
    "in which anger spreads quickly between strangers and might cause aggressive driving or even accidents .",
    "we suggest that in personal anger management , the unexpected contagion to strangers should be seriously considered .",
    "the online social media has already been the most ubiquitous platform for collective intelligence , in which various signals generated from massive connected individuals provide the foundation of collective behavior understanding .",
    "however , how emotion contagion affects the aggregation of the individual behavior , particularly the individual intelligence , is rarely considered .",
    "in fact from our findings , emotion spread , especially the anger s fast contagion , might imply a lot to the collective behavior in the cyber space , especially the crowdsourcing results .",
    "it is even stated that emotion , such as anger , can be a threat to reasoning and arguing  @xcite .",
    "for example , the outrages of massive emotional individuals , which would badly bias the public opinion , might just come from the fast spread of anger , but not because the event itself .",
    "meanwhile , fast contagion of anger also offers a new perspective to picture the emotional behavior of the crowd on the internet .",
    "we suggest that for scenarios like crowdsourcing or collective behavior understanding , angry users should be carefully treated to omit their possible impact on the fair judgment of the observations in the epoch of big data .",
    "besides , diminishing weak ties will function effectively in controlling the diffusion of the internet outrages and make the crowd rational and smart .",
    "contrarily , happiness is believed to unify and clustering the community  @xcite and our finding about the joy s preference on less weak ties also supports this ( see  fig.[fig : graph ] ) , implying that strong ties inside the community disseminate more joyful content in online social media .",
    "meanwhile , self - reports from facebook users also testify that communication with strong ties is associated with improvements in well - being  @xcite , which further testifies that our findings from the computational view is solid .",
    "instead of self - reports in controlled experiments , the natural and emotional postings in weibo social network are collected to investigate the detailed mechanism of emotion contagion from a new view of computational social science . for the first time , we offer the solid evidence for the fact that anger spreads faster than joy in social media because of being more contagious and more preferential on weak ties .",
    "our findings shed lights on both personal anger management and collective behavior understanding .",
    "this study has inevitable limitations .",
    "it is generally accepted that emotion expression is culture dependent and demographics like gender also matter  @xcite , suggesting that exploring how anger spreads in twitter and how the male and the female response differently to emotion contagion will be of great significance in the future work .",
