    "real - world interactions often happen at different levels and are therefore properly modelled by means of multilayer networks .",
    "such multilayer approaches @xcite have been applied to fields ranging from energy infrastructure @xcite and transport @xcite , to epidemiology @xcite .",
    "the multilayer set up can either describe interconnected networks with nodes of the same nature in each layer , but interacting with nodes of different nature in a different layer , or a multiplex structure with nodes of the same nature interacting via a different network in each layer . in any case",
    ", a central methodological question is that of multilayer reducibility , that is , when the multilayer framework is really needed to explain new phenomena , or when the system description can be reduced to an appropriately aggregated or reformulated single - layer network .",
    "an interesting contribution in this direction has recently come from the study of the structural reducibility of multilayer networks , i.e. of the possibility of aggregating some of the layers of a multi - dimensional network while preserving its distinguishability from the corresponding single - layer aggregated graph  @xcite .",
    "although some recent works have pointed out that multiplex dynamics can be intrinsically different from their equivalent single - layer counterparts  @xcite , little attention has been devoted so far to the problem of reducing a process taking place on a multilayer network to a dynamically equivalent process on an appropriate single - layer network . in this paper",
    "we address this general question , by implementing the voter model on a multiplex networks and by studying the reducibility of its dynamics as a test case .",
    "the voter model  @xcite is a nonequilibrium lattice model  @xcite which gives a standard framework for studying the influence of social imitation on the process of opinion formation  @xcite .",
    "a basic question considered in this context is when and how the system reaches an absorbing state with all the interacting nodes in the same state , or when an active dynamical situation of coexistence of different states prevails .",
    "the answer to these questions is known to depend crucially on the network structure and on the update rules employed  @xcite .",
    "the voter model has also been instrumental to understand fundamental phenomena in coevolution dynamics in which node states and network structure have coupled dynamical evolution with two different time scales  @xcite . in terms of comparison with real data , a metapopulation voter model has been recently shown to be able to account for voting patterns in the us general elections  @xcite .        quite frequently",
    ", social interactions happen on different concurrent contexts , so that any model of social imitation based on a single - layer representation of social relationships should probably be regarded only as a first - order approximation of a potentially more complex dynamics . in order to better mimic the multidimensional nature of social interactions ,",
    "we consider here a multiplex voter model , where agents interact at two distinct layers .",
    "we assume also that the system exhibits a certain level of multiplexity , meaning that a fraction @xmath0 of the agents is present on both layers  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "any change in the state of those agents on either of the two layers is automatically transferred to the other layer , effectively coupling the voter model dynamics taking place on each of the two networks . by taking into account heterogeneity in the participation of agents to layers we aim at reproducing an interesting feature of real - world multilevel social systems  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that the percentage of users of an online social network ( e.g. , twitter ) which has also an account on another online social network ( e.g. , facebook or linkedin ) lies somewhere between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , as reported by the social media matrix periodically published by the pew research center  @xcite .",
    "these empirical findings confirm the necessity to consider systems whose multiplexity is neither 0 nor 1 , but somewhere in between . a second important feature of real - world social interactions is the fact that networks corresponding to different contexts share a number of common links , as can be found for instance in data from online games : analysis of the pardus online society in  @xcite yields significant overlap between designation of other players as friends , correspondents , or trading partners .",
    "this property of multilayer networks can be quantified by the edge - overlap parameter  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we address a fundamental question , that is whether the coupling of several voter models into a multiplex dynamics , motivated by the multiplicity of contexts influencing real interactions among individuals , gives rise to qualitatively different phenomena or effects than those observed in the classical single - layer setup .",
    "in particular , we want to establish whether multiplexity makes any difference for a simple social dynamics like the voter model , or if instead the multiplex voter model can indeed be reduced to an equivalent voter model dynamics on an appropriately constructed single - layer network .    a preliminary result on the question of the multilayer reducibility exists for a bilayer of uncorrelated networks evolving according to the voter model with adaptive links  @xcite , but in the limit of zero edge overlap .",
    "in this model each layer is associated with a network plasticity parameter , that controls the rate at which relations among agents are rearranged , such that if the values of plasticity at the two layers are sufficiently different the system displays a network _ shattered _ fragmentation . on the other hand when the layers have the same plasticity one finds that the results coming from a pair approximation in the thermodynamic limit are equivalent to those of an appropriate aggregated single - layer network @xcite .",
    "we build upon this , in time independent networks , examining both the asymptotic properties of the thermodynamic limit and the characteristic times to reach an absorbing state for finite systems .",
    "we also consider different schemes to obtain a possible equivalent aggregated single - layer network and highlight the importance of the degree of multiplexity and edge overlapping .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sect ii introduces our voter dynamics multilayer model . sect .",
    "iii describes our numerical findings .",

    "notice that @xmath13 only if each edge exists in exactly one of the two layers , but not in the other one , while we have @xmath14 only if all the edges exist on both layers .",

    "moreover , we assume that a fraction @xmath0 of the @xmath9 nodes participates in both layers , requiring that if @xmath6 is one of these @xmath18 nodes then its state at the two layers will be identical at the end of every update .",
    "such nodes participating in both layers are chosen randomly at initialization .",
    "we can think of the parameter @xmath0 as the _ interlayer connectivity _ or the _ degree of structural multiplexity _ of the system .",
    "the model is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig0 ] .",
    "the multiplex voter dynamics consists of a sequence of time steps . during a time step",
    "we perform @xmath9 updates , and each update consists of three elementary operations , as follows : _",
    "i ) _ a layer @xmath8 is selected at random , with uniform probability ; _ ii ) _ one of the nodes @xmath6 on layer @xmath8 is chosen at random and its state @xmath15}}_i$ ] is updated according to the classical voter model dynamics , that is , @xmath15}}_i$ ] becomes the same as that of a randomly chosen neighbour of @xmath6 on layer @xmath8 ; _ iii ) _ if the updated node @xmath6 participates in both layers , then the state of the corresponding node in the other layer @xmath19 changes as well by setting @xmath20}}_i = s{^{[\\alpha]}}_i$ ] . with this third operation",
    ", state changes can propagate across layers : indeed the presence of a fraction of nodes existing in both layers intertwines the voter dynamics on the two layers , so that in general the evolution of the overall multiplex dynamics might differ from the one we would observe on two independent networks of the same size . as a limiting case ,",
    "the dynamics reduces to that of a classical voter model on a single - layer network only when @xmath21 .",
    "it is well known that in connected finite - size single - layer networks the voter model dynamics always reaches an absorbing state , where all the nodes have exactly the same state , in a survival time that scales with the system size @xmath9  @xcite . in networks of high effective dimensionality ( including random networks ) , when @xmath22 the dynamics sustains an active disordered state in which nodes continue to change their state  @xcite .",
    "such active state is the one observed asymptotically in large systems , before finite - size fluctuations pull the system towards the absorbing state .",
    "the classical order parameter to measure the activity in the voter model is the so - called _ interface density _",
    "@xmath23 , defined as the fraction of active edges of the network , i.e. of those edges whose endpoints have different states . in the multiplex model we can define : @xmath24}}(t ) = \\frac{1}{2k{^{[\\alpha ] } } }    \\sum_{i}\\sum_{j",
    "< i}a{^{[\\alpha]}}_{ij}|s{^{[\\alpha]}}_i(t ) -    s{^{[\\alpha]}}_j(t)|,\\ ] ] for each layer @xmath8 , @xmath25 , where we denote by @xmath26}}=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i , j}a{^{[\\alpha]}}_{ij}$ ] the total number of edges at layer @xmath8 .",
    "notice that @xmath27 if and only if all the nodes have the same state , while larger values of @xmath28 are associated to active configurations .",
    "a second quantity of interest for a finite system is the average time @xmath29 to reach an absorbing state of consensus .",
    "such a time can be defined as @xmath30 from the survival probability @xmath31 , i.e. the probability for a system to be active at time @xmath32  @xcite .    for single - layer uncorrelated networks at sufficiently large times",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath31 decreases exponentially @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath35 , so that the dependencies of @xmath29 on system size and on the moments of the degree distribution are given precisely by the corresponding dependencies of the _ characteristic time _ @xmath36 .",
    "for uncorrelated networks one can find exact expressions for the value of the average interface density in the thermodynamic limit @xmath37 , as well as for the characteristic time to reach the absorbing state @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "an important feature is that these analytical predictions of @xmath37 and @xmath38 depend only on the values of the first two moments of the degree distribution @xmath39 of the network , i.e. on @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and not on any other microscopic property of the network , and read : @xmath42 where @xmath37 is the average over surviving runs , and @xmath43 in the following we will focus on the values @xmath44 and @xmath45 of interface density and characteristic time of the multiplex voter model as a function of the average edge overlap of the system @xmath10 and of the fraction @xmath0 of nodes present in both layers .",
    "we studied the voter model on a duplex network made by two random regular graphs with @xmath9 nodes , each node having a degree equal to @xmath46 .",
    "we therefore have @xmath47 } } \\rangle}={\\langle k{^{[2 ] } } \\rangle } = \\mu$ ] , and @xmath48 . in our simulations we fixed @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and we studied the dynamics of the system by varying the value of the edge overlap @xmath10 and the fraction @xmath0 of nodes participating in both layers .",
    "since the system is finite , it will eventually converge to the absorbing frozen state corresponding to an interface density equal to zero .",
    "consequently , for each time @xmath32 , we will evaluate the average value of the interface density only over the surviving runs , i.e. on those realisations of the dynamics which are still active at time @xmath32 .",
    "we associate the asymptotic value of this numerically - obtained quantity with the value at the thermodynamic limit , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho_single ] ) , and refer to it as interface density , while being clear whether we are referring to the numerical or analytical results . in the case of a network with two layers , we have of course two values of interface density , one for each layer .",
    "if @xmath51 } } \\rangle } = { \\langle k{^{[2 ] } } \\rangle}$ ] the ensemble averages on the two layers will be equal , and hence the activity of an arbitrary layer is representative of the typical activity of the entire system .",
    "we therefore use the asymptotic value of the interface density of an arbitrary layer to reflect the activity of the multiplex , and dispense with the @xmath8 superscript .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : numericalresults : a ] we report the values of interface density @xmath44 as a function of @xmath0 , and for different values of @xmath10 .",
    "let us consider first the case @xmath52 of no overlap between the structure of the two layers of the network .",
    "when @xmath53 , i.e. when inter - layer state passing is not allowed , the system effectively corresponds to two identical but independent single - layer voter dynamics , so that @xmath44 is in accordance with the classical analytical predictions for single - layer networks ( since @xmath54 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho_single ] ) gives the activity @xmath55 ) .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath21 , i.e. when all the nodes participate in both layers and each edge exists only in one layer , the system is in all respects identical to a single - layer network with @xmath56 ( for @xmath57 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho_single ] ) gives the activity @xmath58 ) .",
    "for intermediate values of @xmath0 the dynamics interpolates monotonically between the two extreme cases , i.e. two dynamically indistinguishable voter models on single - layer networks with @xmath59 ( @xmath53 ) , and one voter model on a single - layer network with @xmath56 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the picture changes completely as soon as @xmath10 is large enough . in general , when the overlap is above some limit , then @xmath44 is a non - monotonic concave function of @xmath0 , with a maximum at a given value of @xmath0 in @xmath60 $ ] which depends on @xmath10 .",
    "notice that , when @xmath14 and @xmath21 , i.e. if the two layers are identical and all the nodes participate in both layers , the dynamics is identical to a voter model on a single - layer network with @xmath59 .",
    "in fact , since all the edges exist on both layers , a node participating in both layers will have only @xmath46 distinct neighbours , and will be connected to each of them on both layers .",
    "hence , in a multiplex network with @xmath14 , the interface density @xmath28 of the voter model takes the same value 0.22 at @xmath53 and at @xmath21 , while for intermediate values of @xmath0 the interface density is higher than that of a voter model on each of the two layers .",
    "we now consider the characteristic time @xmath36 of the multiplex dynamics , where by characteristic time we understand twice the inverse exponent of the multiplex survival probability @xmath61 .",
    "we consider the multiplex as active if at least one of the layers is active , and find that for all @xmath62 the survival probability of the multiplex does decay exponentially with some exponent @xmath63 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : numericalresults : b ] ) .",
    "the only exception is the @xmath64 case of the fully - disconnected multiplex , where the survival probabilities of the layers are independent . in this case",
    "the survival probability of the multiplex is given by the probability that at least one of the layers is active , @xmath65 , or @xmath66 .",
    "this means that for @xmath64 the multiplex survival probability _ does not scale exponentially _ , and hence @xmath67 is not well - defined .",
    "[ fig : numericalresults : c ] shows the characteristic times @xmath45 obtained ( the value at @xmath64 is that of an approximate exponential fit ) .",
    "the trend shows a peak at small @xmath0 , followed by an exponential decay with increasing number of interlayer connections .",
    "the value of edge overlap @xmath10 controls the rate of decrease .",
    "we stress that the peak is _ not _ a consequence of the definition of @xmath36 for the multiplex , and the consequent rogue value of @xmath36 at @xmath64 : the limit is truly singular , with plots for the actual average time until absorption displaying the same features , as do the plots for the characteristic exponent layer by layer .",
    "we also note that the peak is robust with respect to system size .",
    "therefore the slowest finite - size multiplexes are ones where the layers are interconnected by the smallest number of links .",
    "multiplexes with more interlayer connections will stop being active faster , as will wholly disconnected systems .",
    "this insight can be understood by realizing that in a multiplex with few interlayer links , the layers will most of the time function as completely disconnected networks that half the time will try to settle into the absorbing states of consensus different from one another . since this situation",
    "is now prohibited by the few interlayer links , the multiplex will freeze only when one of the layers switches over and both layers reach the same consensus . it is this switching behaviour that is responsible for the peak in @xmath36 for small @xmath0 .",
    "we also notice that this non - linear effect does not depend on the edge overlap @xmath10 . here , unlike with the behaviour of interface density , the overlap does not change qualitatively the behaviour of @xmath36 for increasing @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the more interconnected the multiplex , the higher the role of edge overlap : tuning up @xmath10 causes a decrease in the interface density and results in a longer - lived multiplex , and the effect becomes more pronounced with @xmath0 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the interface density of the multiplex voter model dynamics as a function of @xmath0 and in absence of edge overlap can be rewritten as the interface density of a voter model on a single - layer network having @xmath68 ( where @xmath69 is the average degree of each of the two original layers ) , under some appropriately rescaled time . here",
    "it is important to note that the approximation of @xcite treated the interlayer connections as inherently probabilistic : the @xmath0 parameter was a probability that each node s state gets passed on to the other layer .",
    "it was shown that the analytics of such a system , in the particular case @xmath13 , are equivalent to those of the voter model on some properly aggregated single - layer network . however , as ref .",
    "@xcite only considered the thermodynamic limit , it is not obvious whether the aggregate displays a corresponding rescaling of characteristic time .",
    "nevertheless , it should be possible to devise an aggregate that results from the flattening of the multiplex into a single - layer network , so that the resulting network will have a first moment of the degree distribution equal to the expression @xmath70 given above .",
    "the main question now is whether such a reducibility is possible in the most general case in which the multiplex has edge overlap @xmath71 .",
    "this is indeed the most interesting case , i.e. when in a multiplex there are correlations between the edges at the different layers  @xcite . in the following our working hypothesis",
    "will be that , if the multiplex can indeed be reduced to a monoplex ( in the variables of interest ) , then there exists an aggregate graph such that the behaviour of the voter model on the multiplex is completely described by eq . and",
    "eq . evaluated on the corresponding monoplex . since those equations depend just on the number of nodes and on the first two moments of the degree distribution of the resulting single - layer network , we will now     nodes on each to a single network .",
    "the multiplex contains @xmath18 interlayer links between associated nodes ( pairwise links ) .",
    "these nodes are shown in double circles .",
    "these nodes will have twice as many links in the aggregates , independent of the flattening method .",
    "method 1 keeps @xmath72 nodes in the resultant aggregate , whereas method 2 has @xmath73.,width=326 ]    consider two standard aggregation procedures , and derive analytically the values of the first and second moments of the resulting degree distributions .",
    "let us remind that , by definition , the first moment of the degree distribution of a graph is equal to @xmath74 , where @xmath39 is the degree distribution , so that @xmath75 is the probability that the degree of a node sampled at random from the graph is equal to @xmath76 .",
    "the probability @xmath39 can be also written as : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the number of nodes in the graph having degree equal to @xmath69 and the normalization is just the total number of distinct nodes .",
    "given a duplex formed by two random regular graphs with identical degree @xmath46 , with edge overlap @xmath10 and where a fraction @xmath0 of nodes participates in both layers , we can distinguish two classes of nodes .",
    "the nodes in the first class exist in only one layer , and we indicate as @xmath79 the number of their neighbours , while nodes in the second class exist in both layers ( these are the nodes having an inter - layer link ) and we indicate their degree as @xmath80 . the former class has degree : @xmath81 whereas nodes present on both layers have degree @xmath82 when @xmath13 . however , if the edge overlap is not null , i.e. when @xmath83 , then the nodes being present in both layers have degree @xmath80 equal to : @xmath84 in fact , the degree of a node @xmath6 present in both layers is equal to the sum of its degrees on the two layers ( @xmath85 ) minus the expected number of its edges which are present on both layers .",
    "this number is equal to the probability that a neighbour @xmath7 of @xmath6 is also present on both layers ( which is equal to @xmath0 ) , times the probability that the edge @xmath86 is present in both layers ( which is equal to @xmath10 ) multiplied by the number of neighbours of @xmath6 ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) . hence we get the correction @xmath87 . in the particular case in which @xmath14 , we get @xmath88 , while for @xmath13 we recover @xmath82 .",
    "let us now consider the two following distinct aggregation procedures .",
    "they are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : aggregation_schemas ] and correspond to the two most standard ways to aggregate a duplex into a single - layer network .",
    "the two flattening procedures differ in the total number of nodes and also in the number of nodes of degree @xmath79 and @xmath80 that they produce .",
    "this in turn changes the effective system size of the aggregate network , and the first two moments of the degree distribution . in the following sections we compute these quantities for the two methods , and assess how well the aggregates fare in describing the behaviour of the true multiplex .",
    "we can obtain a single - layer representation of a multiplex by putting the layers side by side with no effective node overlap .",
    "therefore @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and the total number of nodes in the aggregate is just @xmath91 .",
    "the degrees of the nodes participating in just one or both layers are respectively equal to @xmath79 and @xmath80 . by using eq .",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "this method reduces the number of effective nodes in the aggregate through treating nodes present in both layers as _",

    "describe the behaviour of the monoplex .",
    "we contrast the two aggregates by substituting the respective effective value for the first and second moments and the total number of nodes . in other words , we take @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , where the effective values differ depending on the aggregation method .    the results are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : verification ] . consider first the behaviour in the thermodynamic limit , described by the interface density @xmath28 .",
    "both methods result in aggregates whose qualitative behaviour with @xmath10 and @xmath0 corresponds to the trend observed in the multiplex ( fig .",
    "[ fig : verification : a ] ) : for small @xmath0 the system becomes more active with increasing number of interlayer edges , whereas after a certain point activity may decrease , depending on the whether or not the edge overlap is significant enough .",
    "however , neither method gives correct quantitive understanding for a general @xmath10 and @xmath62 .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : verification : c ] , which compares the performance of the two methods through computing the absolute value of the relative error on @xmath28 as heat map of @xmath0 and @xmath10 .",
    "method 1 in general does a better job than method 2 at being systematically consistent , albeit suggesting higher values ( the semicircular drop in the error to zero , observed in method 2 , comes about from the crossing of the analytical and the numerical trends ) . as we have seen before",
    ", the analytical results for method 1 ( at @xmath52 ) correspond to a multiplex with probabilistic interlayer connections of intensity @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , at @xmath52 , comparing the numerical results for the multiplex , and the analytical trend for method 1 can be used to gain insight into the difference induced by an _ alternative method of inteconnecting the layers _ of the multiplex ( in fact , when viewed in this way , the small magnitude of the differences becomes more surprising than their presence ) .",
    "the main quantitative differences arise for a wide range of intermediate overlap values , for medium - to - large interlayer connectivity - precisely the region of parameter space motivated by real - world systems .",
    "the conclusion we draw from this is that , as long as edge overlap is taken into account , standard aggregates can only inform on some qualitative features of large multiplex systems , but can not capture quantitatively the behavior of real multiplex networks .",
    "consider now the characteristic time of the approach to absorbing states of finite - size systems ( fig .",
    "[ fig : verification : b ] ) .",
    "the difference at @xmath64 is due to @xmath115 not being defined for the multiplex ; yet the aggregate timescale is close .",
    "the monotonic decrease for @xmath62 shown by the numerics is captured only by method 2 , with coincidence of @xmath36 values for @xmath116 .",
    "in fact , method 2 does a better job at both qualitative and quantitative results , unlike method 1 , which appears to work best in the thermodynamic limit ( this aggregation method results in a much slower system for large @xmath0 than the observed duplex ) . the main discrepancy",
    ", however , is that neither of the methods capture the jump of @xmath36 at small @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , although the two standard aggregation procedures can come close to describing the qualitative features of long - term duplex activity , they are not sophisticated enough to capture the long timescales associated with sparsely interconnected systems . in the following section we will see",
    "whether and how it is possible to devise more complex aggregation procedures in order to reproduce quantitatively the dynamics of the multiplex voter model .",
    "in principle , the results of the previous section can not absolutely rule out the possibility that there exist other aggregation methods reproducing the behaviour of @xmath44 observed in the multiplex voter model .",
    "our hypothesis is that the deviations from the theory found for @xmath117 are due to the additional non - linearity induced by inter - layer state copying made possible by the presence of a fraction of inter - layer edges . in order to better investigate these non - linear effects , we inverted eq .",

    "we found that in order to accurately reproduce the behaviour of @xmath120 in the whole range of @xmath10 , both @xmath122 and @xmath123 should be at least third - order polynomials in @xmath10 , as made evident by the plots reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] .",
    "notice that the predictions of @xmath103 provided by the two theoretical arguments reported above , based on the linear superpositions of the two layers , contained only linear terms in @xmath10 .",
    "however , the fit of @xmath118 confirms that , when @xmath117 , the behaviour of the multiplex voter model is the result of a highly non - linear combination of the two layers , suggesting that a _ trivial _ single - layer equivalent of the multiplex voter model dynamics does not exist , especially when the underlying multiplex network is characterised by a non - negligible overlap .",
    "that simple aggregation procedures do not produce the observed scaling is also evident by examining the timescales on which finite systems approach absorbing states . for @xmath62 ,",
    "the characteristic time @xmath45 is an exponentially decreasing function of @xmath0 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : numericalresults : b ] ) . figure  [ fig : nonlinear : b ]",
    "shows that @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and that the system - size dependency does not enter into it .",
    "hence , @xmath130 . thus increasing the edge overlap @xmath10 results in longer - lived systems",
    ", while adding more interlayer links produces the opposite effect .",
    "this was additionally confirmed by examining the behaviour of the rescaled time until absorption @xmath131 , which showed the same qualitative trend and almost identical @xmath132 and @xmath133 coefficients .",
    "multilayer networks allow to extend the applicability of network theory to more realistic contexts in which nodes are connected through concurrent interaction patterns of different kinds .",
    "however , a fundamental open question to answer is whether the added complexity yielded by multilayer networks is really needed to model network phenomena , or if instead there exist simple ways of representing multiplex dynamics through appropriately constructed processes occurring on appropriately constructed single - layer networks .",
    "we have investigated here the problem of reducing the multiplex voter model to an equivalent single - layer dynamics .",
    "we have considered the predictions about the level of activity of the multiplex voter model in the thermodynamic limit , as measured by the interface density , as well as the time to reach the absorbing state for finite systems .",
    "we have found that results for the interface density based on single - layer aggregated graphs are accurate only when there is little or no interaction between the layers ( @xmath0 sufficiently small ) , or when there is full connectivity ( @xmath134 ) and the edge overlap @xmath10 is either @xmath135 or @xmath136 .",
    "for the complementary broad range of parameters , any standard aggregation procedure can only give some qualitative information about the interface density , but fails to reproduce the quantitative details .",
    "we showed that edge overlap and multiplexity have two opposite effects on the long - term dynamics of the multiplex voter model , and in particular that an increase in the value of edge overlap can counter the action of increasing the fraction of interlayer links , leading to an overall _ decrease _ in the interface density of the multiplex .",
    "in fact , we showed numerically that any equivalent single - layer representation of the multiplex voter model dynamics entails the construction of an aggregate network which is a highly non - linear combination of the original layers .",
    "these results will be found at the same time surprising and interesting by all the researchers aiming at modelling social interaction in real - world scenarios . as a matter of fact",
    ", it has been recently shown that multilayer social networks are normally _ truly multiplex _ , meaning that they are characterised by non - negligible values of edge overlap  @xcite and by an intermediate level of multiplexity  @xcite . and as we have shown in this work , the single - layer voter model approximation is qualitatively ( when considering the characteristic time ) and quantitatively ( when considering both the characteristic time and the interface density ) inaccurate when the edge overlap @xmath10 and the degree of multiplexing @xmath0 are far from their extreme values @xmath135 or @xmath136 .",
    "this is reflected in the average timescales of consensus for finite systems , as we found that a multiplex with very few interlayer connections takes the longest time to reach consensus , much more than would probabilistically be needed by two disconnected monoplexes .",
    "this nonlinear effect is not captured by either of the simple aggregation procedures proposed in the paper .",
    "the case of dynamical irreducibility of a multiplex process presented in this work raises the important question of whether other unknown phenomena might be lurking in the multilayer structure of real - world systems .",
    "this question , together with the insights about the intrinsically multidimensional nature of the multiplex voter model , represents a stimulus to perform further research along these lines ."
