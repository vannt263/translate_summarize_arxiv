    "they show that for every point @xmath10 and sequence of scales @xmath11 there is a subsequence ( which we relabel ) and a harmonic polynomial @xmath12 such that @xmath13 one may hope that only linear polynomials @xmath14 appear in ( [ firstblowup ] ) , i.e.  that the boundary is always flat on small scales ; however , there are examples of domains with @xmath15 and @xmath16 for which non - linear polynomials @xmath14 appear ( see example 1.4 below ) .",
    "the method in @xcite relates the geometric blow - ups of the boundary to tangent measures of the harmonic measure .",
    "thus information about the free boundary may be obtained by studying tangent measures of harmonic measure  this is our strategy for the question above . to identify the polynomials appearing in ( [ firstblowup ] ) , we study properties of  polynomial harmonic measures \" in the topology of weak convergence of radon measures of @xmath17 .",

    "the _ harmonic measure @xmath20 associated to @xmath14 _ is the unique harmonic measure with pole at infinity on @xmath21 with green function @xmath18 .",
