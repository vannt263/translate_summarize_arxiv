    "understanding the processes occurring in the nuclear disk of our own galaxy is interesting not only for insight into our own milky way galaxy , but also because its study can potentially provide a template to the closest galactic nuclei .",
    "this important region of the galaxy hosts several sources of energetic activity , and is the site of massive molecular clouds with pockets of past and present massive star formation . on a larger scale ,",
    "the distribution of molecular clouds is asymmetric in the so - called `` central molecular zone '' showing 2/3 of the molecular gas on the positive longitude side of the galactic center region @xcite .",
    "the nature of this asymmetry in the context of gas dynamics is not understood .",
    "this unique region is also distinguished from the rest of the galaxy by the presence of a bar that is responsible for feeding gas into the central few hundred parsecs of the galaxy .",
    "in particular , the non - circular motion of the gas in this region is thought to be induced by the bar s potential combined with dynamical friction leading to migration of molecular clouds to the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the collision of these migrating molecular clouds with each other in a small volume of the galactic center is thought to be the driving mechanism for star formation on a wide range of scales @xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible that the star formation process depends on the galactic center environment including the effects of the bar on the gas dynamics .",
    "although there is a high concentration of dense molecular clouds distributed in the galactic center region , the star formation rate has shown extreme values .",
    "on the one hand , the massive star forming region sgr b2 points to the closest example of starburst activity in our galaxy .",
    "this region contains some of the most spectacular young and dense stellar clusters having an age of a few million years @xcite . in the context of recently formed stars in the nuclear disk , detailed study using infrared space observatory ( iso ) at 7 and 15@xmath0 m indicates the presence of a population of young stellar object ( yso ) candidates in the region @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite . on the other hand , quiescent giant molecular clouds such as g0.25 - 0.01 @xcite appear to contain highly inefficient star formation .",
    "one intriguing question is whether the star formation in this region proceeds analogously to that elsewhere in the galaxy , or whether the central region provides a unique environment and might provide a template for alternative modes of star formation in galactic nuclei generally .",
    "for example , the molecular clouds in the galactic center region have elevated temperatures .",
    "molecular line studies yield temperature estimates of 75 to 200k ( httemeister et al .",
    "1993 ) , while far - infrared data indicate dust temperatures @xmath11 30k ( odenwald & fazio 1984 ; cox & laureijs 1989 ; pierce - price et al .",
    "this temperature discrepancy suggests direct heating of the molecular gas either by cosmic rays or shocks , which may reduce the efficiency of star formation in the region ( lis et al . 2001b ; yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "2007b ) .",
    "in order to census past and present star formation activity and to gain insight into the nature of star formation in the unique environment of the galactic center , we carried out a 24@xmath0 m survey of the central molecular zone and beyond between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this is the most recent in a series of papers that have presented sensitive surveys of the galactic center region at near - ir and mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "our mips survey provides an important data point when combined with the @xmath14 survey of the galactic center region @xcite .",
    "this allows us to distinguish ysos and agbs by fitting the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of infrared point sources as well as by constructing color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) .",
    "furthermore , 24@xmath0 m observations reveal dense , cold dust clouds through their absorption against background emission and identify warm dust clouds through their emission without being contaminated by pah emission .",
    "the presence of large - scale irdcs in the galactic center at this wavelength traces potential sites of the earliest phase of active and quiescent star formation .",
    "in particular , the correlation of 24@xmath0 m point sources distributed toward infrared dark clouds with 4.5@xmath0 m excess sources , thought to trace shock excited molecular emission , can be used to identify the earliest phase of massive star formation ( chambers et al .",
    "lastly , 24@xmath0 m emission points to hii regions with embedded thermal sources of heating as well as to sites where synchrotron emission from relativistic particles is produced . the ratio of 24@xmath0 m to radio emission can separate thermal from nonthermal sources @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 describes details of observations using mips , irac , and radio data , while section 3 presents the large scale distribution of extended clouds and compact stellar sources .",
    "then in section 4 we focus on the stellar distribution of 24@xmath0 m sources and the color magnitude diagram of the sources covered by the mips and irac surveys .",
    "section 5 discusses the seds of candidate ysos followed by a brief description of individual candidate sites of on - going star formation activity .",
    "the new sites of young , massive star formation are found by the detection of sources with excess 4.5@xmath0 m emission . there is a rich collection of prominent infrared sources toward the galactic center , some of which such as sgr a",
    ", the radio arc and sgr c , are saturated .",
    "we discuss elsewhere the distribution of 24@xmath0 m emission from sgr a ( g0.0 - 0.0 ) and the galactic center radio arc ( g0.2 - 0.0 ) , the sgr b hii complex ( g0.7 - 0.0 ) and g0.6 - 0.0 , sgr c ( g359.4 - 0.1 ) , sgr e ( g358.7 - 0.0 ) and the tornado nebula . here",
    "we assume the distance to the galactic center is 8.5 kpc ( ghez et al .",
    "apart from the 24@xmath0 m survey , several other surveys of this region have recently been carried out in other wavelength bands , as described briefly below .",
    "we have correlated these data with our mips survey data .",
    "the galactic center region is very bright at mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "therefore , to cover the full 8 @xmath15 2 survey area most efficiently , we used mips in fast scan mode with large cross - scan steps of 302@xmath16 . because of the permitted scan orientation during the galactic center visibility window , the map was a parallelogram .",
    "this fast scan mode achieved enough individual source sightings for high reliability and reached the specified 1 mjy detection limit .",
    "eight rectangular scans were performed in sequence , each taking approximately 2.3 hours , giving a total observing time of @xmath1 18 hours .",
    "the diffraction limit of the 24@xmath0 m image is 5.8@xmath17 .",
    "these data represent the highest spatial resolution and sensitivity large - scale map made of the inner few degrees of the galactic center at 24@xmath0 m .",
    "the source photometry was based on the 24@xmath0 m catalog compiled by hinz et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "our data are complemented by the _",
    "legacy program mips inner galactic plane survey ( mipsgal ) which observed 220 deg@xmath18 of the inner galactic plane , @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath21 , at 24 and 70@xmath22 @xcite which avoided duplicating coverage of the galactic center region .",
    "mipsgal - ii post - bcd data were used to fill gaps around the high latitude edges .",
    "this was done by reprojecting the mipsgal ii data over the whole field .",
    "the mipsgal data are only used where there is zero coverage at the edges of the mosaic .",
    "there are several hii regions where the 24@xmath22 emission is saturated .",
    "the most extended saturated regions lie toward sgr a , the radio arc and sgr c , near @xmath23 , respectively",
    ". the point source saturation limit , depending on the background level , ranges between 4 and 4.5 jy which correspond to 0.60 and 0.51 magnitudes at 24 @xmath22 . in order to remedy the saturation artifacts , we replaced the saturated regions by msx band e data ( 21.34 @xmath22 ) using the following steps .",
    "( 1 ) the msx data are reprojected to match the pixel scale and alignment of the mips image .",
    "a relative distortion between the positions of sources in msx and mips images was corrected by a 4th - order 2-d polynomial warping of the msx images .",
    "this correction reduced positional differences to @xmath1 0.5 pixels ( @xmath24 pixels ) .",
    "( 2 ) a linear fit to the correlation between pixel intensities is performed to derive a photometric scale factor and offset to be applied to match msx band e intensities with mips 24@xmath22 intensities .",
    "the correlation is performed with bright ( but not saturated ) data by restricting pixel intensities to @xmath25 mjy sr@xmath5 for the mips data and in the range of @xmath26\\times10^{-5}$ ] w m@xmath27 sr@xmath5 .",
    "the derived scale factor was @xmath140% larger than the quoted factor for converting msx data from w m@xmath27 sr@xmath5 to mjy sr@xmath5 .",
    "the reason for such a discrepancy is not clear , but part of the difference may be caused by the slightly different nominal wavelengths of the instruments .",
    "( 3 ) a mask is defined to identify the saturated regions .",
    "the mask is set to 1.0 where the rescaled msx data are brighter than 1000 mjy sr@xmath5 and then ramped down to 0.0 for any pixels @xmath28 pixels away from these regions .",
    "( 4 ) the mask , and 1.0 minus the mask , are then applied as weights in the linear combination of the msx and mips images .",
    "thus , in the resulting image , 99.6% of the pixels contain unmodified mips intensities , 0.3% of the pixels contain scaled msx intensities , and in between 0.1% of the pixels contain a weighted average of mips and scaled msx intensities .",
    "( 5 ) lastly , we interpolate over @xmath110 small mips coverage gaps that occupy 0.03% of the image .    despite the weighted averages , differences in the psf widths ( @xmath29 for msx , @xmath30 for mips ) create artifacts where msx data replace saturated mips point sources . therefore ,",
    "any quantitative analysis on mips saturated sources should be performed on the original msx images , rather than the combined mips+msx images .",
    "the combined images are useful for qualitative evaluation of the structure and color of bright extended emission , and of course , for any unsaturated emission .      in order to obtain more complete seds of some of the high latitude 24@xmath0 m sources that show excess emission at 4.5@xmath0 m",
    ", we selected a total of nine such sources distributed at high galactic latitudes within our survey .",
    "these sources were observed separately with mips at 70@xmath0 m .",
    "the low - latitude sources were not selected due their possible saturation at low latitudes in the plane .",
    "these targets were observed in mips photometry mode with the exposure time for each object of 3 seconds and default pixel scale of 10@xmath31 .",
    "all observations were obtained between 2007 september 21 and 23 .",
    "these data were reduced using the mips instrument team s data analysis tool v. 3.06 @xcite .",
    "aperture photometry was performed utilizing a set of custom idl scripts .",
    "the data were flux calibrated using the conversion factor of 702@xmath32 mjy sr@xmath5 per raw mips units ( 5% uncertainty ) following gordon et al .",
    "an aperture of @xmath33 was used , with a sky radius of 39@xmath34 .",
    "the aperture correction for this configuration is 1.185 .",
    "radio continuum observations at @xmath3520 cm surveyed the @xmath36 and @xmath37 region with a spatial resolution of @xmath38 and 10@xmath16 using two different array configurations of the very large array ( vla ) of the national radio astronomy observatory @xcite .",
    "another recent survey at 20 cm has extended this region to higher positive latitudes of up to 1@xcite .",
    "we obtained 32 overlapping images at 20 cm from these two surveys and convolved individual images with a gaussian having a fwhm=12.8@xmath39 before the images were mosaiced .",
    "this region has also been observed at 20 and 6 cm with the vla @xcite .",
    "however , these surveys are short snapshot observations of a region dominated by bright sources with a wide range of angular scales and poor sensitivity and so are not useful for comparison with infrared sources due to the non - uniform _ uv _ coverage .",
    "the detection of point sources at 90 and 20 cm @xcite does suffer from the artifacts introduced by the lack of _ uv _ coverage .",
    "more recently , lang et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have completed a 6 cm survey of the galactic center region with a uniform _ uv _ coverage .",
    "we have used this data set to measure the fluxes of several point sources in the g359.43 + 0.02 cluster , as described below .",
    "a survey of spitzer / irac observations of the central 2@xmath15 1.4(@xmath40 pc ) was recently conducted in the four wavelength bands at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8@xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "the catalog presented in ramirez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) includes point source photometry from the irac survey and correlates those sources with previously published photometry from 2mass at j , h , and k@xmath41 bands @xcite .    a submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) survey of the galactic center covered a region of 2@xmath1505 at 450 and 850@xmath0 m with a spatial resolution of 8and 15 , respectively @xcite .",
    "given the low resolution of the submillimeter data , the detected submillimeter flux is used as upper limits at 450@xmath0 m and 850@xmath0 m @xcite in the spectral energy distribution of individual point sources .",
    "however , large - scale submillimeter maps of extended sources at 450 and 850@xmath0 m have been used for comparison with radio and mid - ir images .",
    "figure [ fig:1]a shows the large scale view of the surveyed region at 24@xmath0 m . in order to bring out the weak sources , the sources distributed between 1.8@xmath42 are burned out in this figure .",
    "the mean brightness of this region is roughly 4 to 5 times higher than the region beyond the inner few degrees of the galactic center .",
    "several extended hii regions are identified to have radio continuum and submillimeter counterparts @xcite .",
    "an enlarged view of the burned - out 3@xmath152region is shown in figure [ fig:1]b .",
    "prominent galactic center hii complexes along the galactic plane are associated with sgr a ",
    "e , the arches and the pistol , all of which are labeled , as shown in figure 1c .",
    "we note two extended 24@xmath0 m emitting features g0.23 - 0.05 and g0.31 - 0.07 lying between the radio arc and sgr b1 .",
    "the radio arc , which includes the arches cluster and the pistol nebula , consists of a network of nonthermal radio filaments running perpendicular to the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "we note a number of parallel filamentary features at 24@xmath0 m associated with g0.31 - 0.07 which will be discussed elsewhere . at positive latitudes ,",
    "two extended clouds known as the western and eastern galactic center lobes are shown prominently in figure [ fig:1]b near @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the striking structure of the western lobe with its strong 24@xmath0 m emission coincides with afgl 5376 @xcite . in the eastern lobe ,",
    "two columns of 24@xmath0 m features with an extension of about 30@xmath45 run parallel to each other away from the galactic plane .",
    "these features lie in the region of the galactic center lobe that is known to emit strong synchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "the `` double - helix '' nebula @xcite lies along the northern extension of the eastern linear feature in the galactic center lobe .",
    "the southern ends of these linear features appear to be pointed toward the large - scale ionized features associated with the arches cluster g0.12 + 0.02 and a cluster of hii regions ( h1h5 ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are several counterparts to foreground h@xmath46 emission line nebulae , rcw 137 , 141 , and 142 , which are prominent at @xmath47 02 .    at positive longitudes ,",
    "a string of irdcs is concentrated between l@xmath48 and sgr b2 near l=0.7@xmath49 .",
    "sub - millimeter emission from these clouds is prominent at 450 and 850@xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:2]a displays an enlarged view of 24@xmath0 m emission from dust clouds and stellar sources distributed at positive longitudes . with careful adjustment of the overall background level , the ratio of irac images , such as @xmath50^{0.5}$ ] , are used to highlight the location and structure of the ir dark clouds .",
    "this ratio is high for the irdcs ( figure [ fig:2]b ) .",
    "the bright feature in this figure corresponds to a dust lane that consists of a string of dust clouds .",
    "these clouds appear narrow near l=0.25and become increasingly wider extending toward negative latitudes near sgr b2 .",
    "the kinematics of this dust lane have been studied in numerous molecular line surveys of this region @xcite .    at negative latitudes , the distribution of dust emission at 24@xmath0 m and the ratio map",
    "are shown in figure [ fig:3]a , b , respectively .",
    "irdcs are detected toward the well - known molecular clouds m-0.13 - 0.08 ( 20 ) and m-0.02 - 0.07 ( 50 ) @xcite .",
    "both clouds are located near the galactic center .",
    "one of the largest structures in the ratio map is the pair of two dust lanes that run parallel to each other along the galactic plane between l=0and l=-40@xmath45 on the positive and negative latitudes .",
    "the previous cs ( 1 - 0 ) line study of this region has shown the counterpart to the positive latitude dust lane to have a coherent kinematic structure .",
    "we also note an elongated dust cloud ( called `` vertical irdc '' in fig .",
    "1c ) running toward positive latitudes at l=-40@xmath45 , b=4@xmath45 with a latitude extent of 12@xmath45 .",
    "the prominence of this feature with respect to the dust lanes in the ratio map suggests that it is a foreground cloud .      in order to analyze the color distribution at different bands , a close - up view of the central region of the 24@xmath0 m survey is cropped to the exact size of the 8@xmath0 m survey @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:13]a shows the combined 24 , 8 and 4.5@xmath0 m images with red , green and blue colors , respectively . figure",
    "[ fig:13]b shows only the 3.6 , 4.5 , and 8@xmath0 m images in blue , green and red colors , respectively .",
    "overall , there is a great deal of non - uniformity in the color distribution detected between irac and mips images , as shown in figure [ fig:13]a .",
    "in contrast , uniform color distribution is noted in irac images , as shown in figure [ fig:13]b @xcite .",
    "one of the main reasons for the non - uniformity of colors is that 24@xmath0 m emission is an excellent diagnostic of local sources of heating of large dust grains .",
    "this is in part due to the fact that thermal emission from large dust grains at 24@xmath0 m becomes significantly enhanced when the radiation field is only 100 times that of the local interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) in the solar vicinity @xcite .",
    "in contrast , 8@xmath0 m emission mainly arises from aromatics ( hereafter pahs ) that are excited by the interstellar radiation field and nearby ob stars .",
    "thermal emission from small dust grains becomes strong enough to compete with the pah emission in the 8@xmath0 m band only when the local radiation field is about 10@xmath51 times that of the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "thus , there is much less variation in the 8@xmath0 m to 5.8@xmath0 m color than in the 24@xmath0 m to 8@xmath0 m color .",
    "these color distribution images based on irac and mips data place a lower limit of @xmath1100 times the isrf throughout the galactic center region with the exception of the regions known to have a very strong radiation field such as the arches and sgr a ( see arendt et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "several extended sources show a distinct pattern of excess 24@xmath0 m emission ( red in fig .",
    "4a ) surrounded by 8@xmath0 m emission ( green and yellow in fig .",
    "4a ) . the 24@xmath0 m excess ( or 8@xmath0 m deficit )",
    "can be accounted for by the destruction of pahs by local sources of uv radiation or shocks @xcite .",
    "in contrast to small grains and pahs that can be destroyed , the large dust grains re - radiate the absorbed uv radiation at long wavelengths , 24@xmath0 m .",
    "the most striking example that shows these effects is the optical h@xmath46 line emission nebulae rcw 137 , 141 and 142 which are foreground sources and are internally heated .",
    "pahs are destroyed close to the source of heating , but are excited at the edge of the cloud by the external ism radiation field .",
    "the 24@xmath0 m diffuse emission along the galactic plane traces local sources of heating by hii regions .",
    "there is another type of 24@xmath0 m source that shows neither 8@xmath0 m counterpart nor any evidence for embedded sources of heating .",
    "afgl 5376 @xcite is one example that is located at high latitudes .",
    "g0.85 - 0.44 is another source that shows similar characteristics .",
    "alternative mechanisms must be responsible for heating these clouds .",
    "one candidate is the high flux of cosmic rays that could be responsible for heating large dust grains but not pahs .",
    "we note several irdcs in figure [ fig:13]a with different levels of darkness .",
    "these cold , dark clouds are seen in absorption against the diffuse background emission .",
    "the irdcs are optically thick even at 24@xmath0 m .",
    "therefore , their apparent surface brightnesses are more of an indication of the emitting column density on the line of sight to the cloud ( i.e. , the cloud s distance ) than a sign of the optical depth of the irdcs .",
    "for example , we note that the irdcs at high and low galactic plane latitudes , such as g0.2 + 0.47 and g-0.67 + 0.18 are the darkest clouds , suggesting that they are distributed locally along the line of sight .",
    "as was shown in the ratio maps , the large scale distribution of irdcs forming a dust lane implies an early phase of massive star or star cluster formation in the galactic center region .",
    "irdcs are dense ( @xmath52 @xmath53 ) , cold ( @xmath54k ) and attain high column densities ( @xmath55 cm@xmath27 ) in the galactic disk @xcite",
    ". the extreme physical properties of the clouds in the galactic center region should be even more suitable for young , massive star cluster formation .",
    "we note the string of irdcs is coincident with the `` dust ridge '' @xcite , as shown in figure 1c .",
    "what is remarkable is a large - scale east - west ridge of irdcs tracing dense molecular gas between g0.25 + 0.01 and sgr b2 .",
    "this continuous east - west irdc ridge shows a sinusoidal appearance on a scale of @xmath57 corresponding to 12 pc .",
    "the western half of this large - scale ridge of irdcs is quiescent @xcite in its star formation activity whereas the eastern half shows spectacular on - going star formation .",
    "the string of submillimeter emitting molecular clouds includes g0.25 + 0.01 and the sgr b complex and is darker than the well - known 20 and 50 molecular clouds m-0.13 - 0.08 and m-0.02 - 0.07 as well as clouds in the negative longitude side of the galactic center .",
    "this behavior suggests that the positive - longitude irdcs are closer than the 20 and 50 and sgr c clouds .",
    "the large - scale distribution of irdcs traces coherent molecular lanes running parallel to the nuclear disk @xcite , as shown in ratio maps of figures 2 and 3 .",
    "the color contrast of the coherent , large scale dust lane suggests that the molecular gas in the central molecular zone is oriented in the same direction as that of the well - known stellar bar @xcite .",
    "the blue color ( 4.5@xmath0 m emission ) in figure [ fig:13]a represents the stellar density distribution in sgr a where the evolved stellar core of the bulge peaks .",
    "this is mostly unresolved stellar sources , not intrinsically diffuse emission .",
    "a number of red ( 24@xmath0 m ) point sources are also seen in this figure that appear to be embedded within irdcs suggesting that they are protostellar candidates , as will be discussed in section 5 .",
    "the red color reveals embedded stellar sources that heat surrounding dust grains to high temperatures .",
    "numerous compact hii regions with radio continuum counterparts are distributed along the galactic plane near the galactic center .    to reveal the distribution of intrinsically red compact sources against the strong extended emission",
    ", we constructed a 24@xmath0 m to 8@xmath0 m intensity ratio image , which is presented in figure [ fig:14]a .",
    "regions with relatively strong 24@xmath0 m emission are light whereas regions with strong 8@xmath0 m ( pah ) emission are dark .",
    "most of the emission from the ism ( including that on the line of sight to irdcs ) disappears into a flat gray background .",
    "the disappearance of irdcs is because they are opaque at both 8@xmath0 m and 24@xmath0 m .",
    "the extinction ratio ( a@xmath58/a@xmath59 ) @xcite implies a lack of reddening even for clouds that are not opaque ( e.g. , their edges ) .",
    "the `` removal '' of the typical ism emission and dark clouds accentuates a number of structures and helps reveal some fainter , compact and extended sources with excess 24@xmath0 m emission .",
    "the most striking feature in the ratio map is the distribution of compact emission from a high concentration of strong ir - excess objects , candidate ysos or uchii regions distributed between @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "figure [ fig:14]b shows the relationship between the compact 24@xmath0 m point sources and the molecular gas .",
    "it is a composite image indicating 24@xmath0 m in green and 450@xmath0 m in red .",
    "sub - millimetre emission at 450@xmath0 m is optically thin and is known to be an excellent tracer of molecular gas distributed in the central molecular zone .",
    "the comparison of the distribution of 24@xmath0 m emission and the ratio map shows two features .",
    "one is the distribution of extended sub - millimetre emission being strongest in the positive longitude side the galactic center .",
    "it is clear that molecular gas distribution at @xmath62 is more uniform and more intense at 450@xmath0 m than that at negative longitudes .",
    "similar asymmetric structure is also noted in cs and co line observations @xcite .",
    "this asymmetric distribution shows 2/3 of the mass of molecular gas on the positive longitude side of the galactic center region @xcite .",
    "the presence of such an asymmetry is mainly due to massive clouds associated with sgr b2 and the dust ridge and a lack of massive , dense clouds at @xmath63 with the exception of sgr c.    the second feature is the distribution of 450@xmath0 m emission at negative longitudes showing that 24@xmath0 m sources anti - correlate with the distribution of dust clouds .",
    "remarkably , the distribution of 24@xmath0 m point sources appears to be sandwiched by two layers of dust and gas clouds running parallel to the galactic plane and symmetrically distributed with respect to the galactic center .",
    "the `` bow - tie '' dust layers , as schematically drawn in figure [ fig:1]c , stretch along both positive and negative longitudes and coincide with irdcs at 8@xmath0 m and 24@xmath0 m .",
    "submillimeter emission is also noted from a cloud at negative latitudes b=-5@xmath45 .",
    "this feature is the negative latitude counterpart to the layer of submillimeter emitting cloud in the region between g0.25 + 0.01 and sgr b1 at positive longitudes .",
    "the negative latitude submillimeter layer does not have an irdc counterpart , implying that it is most likely located on the far side of sgr b2 .",
    "thus , it is likely that these molecular layers are closer to us at positive longitudes than at negative ones .",
    "what is remarkable from the mid - ir and submillimeter images are that the `` bow - tie '' structure in fact consists of two layers of molecular and dust clouds that are symmetrically distributed with respect to the galactic center .",
    "however , it is most likely that the positive longitude side of these molecular layers is closer to us than those at negative latitudes .",
    "we also note that unlike the gas and dust distributions , the 24@xmath0 m point sources are more uniformly distributed on the negative longitudes than at positive ones .",
    "given that the chain of irdcs that include sgr b2 are thought to be closer than those at negative longitude , it could be that they hide a distant population of 24@xmath0 m sources and create an apparent asymmetry , as discussed in more detail below .",
    "to investigate the nature of the 24@xmath0 m compact sources , 824@xmath0 m ( [ 8]-[24]@xmath0 m ) color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) are constructed for sources within @xmath64 and @xmath65=1.4 degrees , corresponding to the central 0.4@xmath15 0.05 kpc region .",
    "the cmd of these sources identified in the positive and negative longitudes is shown in figure [ fig:15 ] .",
    "these data used the mips catalog at 24@xmath0 m @xcite and irac catalog at 8@xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "a total of 172,670 sources is detected , 70,794 and 101,876 of which are found in the region restricted to positive and negative longitudes , respectively .",
    "there is an excess of 31082 sources identified in negative longitudes .",
    "this asymmetry could be explained by the high extinction experienced by mid - ir sources in the region where dense molecular clouds are highly concentrated .",
    "alternatively , the distribution of compact dusty sources could be due to an intrinsic excess of ysos or evolved agb stars . the dashed line in figure 6",
    "is chosen empirically , as discussed below , to separate the reddest ysos from agbs .",
    "each of the two possibilities is discussed below .",
    "oh / ir stars are oxygen - rich , mass - losing cool giants that represent evolved agb stars at the end of their lives @xcite .",
    "these post agb stars are known to be dusty with excess emission at infrared wavelengths .",
    "ysos are also known to have excess emission in infrared wavelengths and are characterized by dusty envelopes and disks that absorb the radiation from the central protostar @xcite . to explore the color of evolved stars in the galactic center",
    ", we examined the spatial distribution of known oh / ir stars in the region shown in figure [ fig:15 ] using the oh 1612 mhz catalogs @xcite .",
    "oh / ir surveys are not affected by visual extinction .",
    "these surveys have uniformly sampled the region covered by irac observations .",
    "the shallow but uniformly sampled survey by @xcite finds a total of 7 and 9 oh / ir stars in the restricted region , for positive and negative longitudes , respectively .",
    "similarly , the spatial distribution of oh / ir stars on a large scale is symmetric with respect to the galactic center .",
    "although , there are not many oh / ir masers that we found to have infrared counterparts in the restricted region of our survey , we find no evidence of asymmetry in the distribution of oh / ir stars with respect to the galactic center .    to examine whether the observed color of the infrared sources ( ortiz et al . 2002 ; ojha et al .",
    "2007 ) can be due to the excess of ysos , we first identify the color of oh / ir stars .",
    "the reddening toward these galactic center sources is minimally affected by the differential extinction between 8 and 24@xmath0 m . @xcite",
    "have recently derived a(8@xmath0 m ) - a(24@xmath0 m ) @xmath66 a(k ) .",
    "the color variation between 8 and 24@xmath0 m should be @xmath670.2 mag assuming a(k ) @xmath68 or @xmath130 magnitudes of visual extinction .",
    "thus , the observed color of the sources is intrinsic . here",
    ", we make an empirical assumption that the very red sources are likely to be candidate ysos .",
    "figure [ fig:16]a shows the cmd of all the 24@xmath0 m sources found in the surveyed region by irac .",
    "the colors of oh / ir stars that are found using the survey by @xcite are shown as triangles in figure [ fig:16]a and are distributed to the left of the dashed line that was selected empirically .",
    "the color of oh / ir masers is clearly distinguished from the reddest and faintest sources ( by a few magnitudes ) .",
    "the dashed line in figure [ fig:16]a is the slope that separates most of the yso candidates to the right from the rest of the sources that have 24 and 8@xmath0 m counterparts .",
    "the left side of the slope in figure [ fig:16]a indicates a trend of ir excess sources with luminosity .",
    "the cmd of the lmc shows a similar trend among luminous agb stars due to the relationship between increasing radiation pressure resulting in more mass loss in dust , and therefore more ir excess ( see fig .",
    "3a of whitney et al .",
    "thus , we believe the sources to the right of the slope in figure [ fig:16]a are dominated by candidate ysos .",
    "the color - color diagram between [ 8]-[24]@xmath0 m is also shown in figure [ fig:16]b where the candidate ysos are shown as crosses . in the restricted @xmath69 , @xmath70 region the total number of yso candidates",
    "is found to be 347 and 212 distributed on the negative and positive longitudes , respectively .",
    "the spatial distribution of candidate ysos with [ 8]-[24 ] greater than 4 is shown in figure [ fig:16]c revealing that the reddest infrared sources are distributed mostly along the galactic plane .",
    "the numbers of yso candidates are lower limits because the colors of stars in the saturated regions near @xmath71 and @xmath72 could not be examined ( see figure [ fig:16]c ) . in spite of these restrictions",
    ", we note that most of the candidate ysos are distributed in the negative latitudes , very close to the galactic equator .",
    "the saturated sources at 24@xmath0 m as well as the contaminating sources limit our ability to address the issue of completeness .",
    "however , we believe that the distribution of oh / ir sources validates our empirical choice for the slope of the dashed line used to identify most of the yso candidates . an additional step is taken in @xmath73 to identify the fraction of yso candidates via sed fitting of the sources selected from the right region of the cmd of figure 7 .",
    "as discussed below , @xmath160 - 65% of the total number of sources from the cmds are sed fitted .",
    "ultimately , future spectroscopic measurements of yso candidates should be able to address the completeness issue .      to test the possibility that there is an asymmetric distribution of candidate ysos with respect to the galactic center , we examined two tracers that are not affected by visual extinction . first , we examined compact radio continuum sources @xcite and found 44 and 58 sources in the positive and negative longitude sides of the galactic center , restricted to the same regions where candidate ysos are found .",
    "it is known that sgr b2 is one of the most active star - forming sites in the galaxy at @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "we note that 16 of the 44 compact radio sources at the positive longitudes arise only from ultracompact hii regions in sgr b2 . on the other hand , compact radio continuum sources in the @xmath76 region",
    "are distributed more uniformly than in the region at @xmath77 degrees .",
    "the excess number of 14 sources at negative longitudes combined with non - uniform distribution of compact radio continuum sources at positive longitudes imply an asymmetry of radio continuum sources that can not be explained by excess extinction at positive latitudes .",
    "this is consistent with the excess of infrared sources in the negative longitudes of the galactic center .",
    "additional support for this picture comes from h@xmath78o maser study of the same region showing a similar distribution to that of compact 20 cm radio continuum sources .",
    "this survey used the @xmath79 ( iras ) galactic center catalog @xcite to search for h@xmath78 masers .",
    "the largest concentration of star forming water masers is found in sgr b2 whereas the star forming h@xmath78o masers are populated uniformly in the negative longitude sides of the galactic center @xcite .",
    "for example , the targeted survey by taylor et al . which excluded the sgr b2 region , detected a total of 13 and one star forming h@xmath78o masers at the negative and positive longitudes , respectively .",
    "although water maser survey observations have not uniformly sampled the galactic center region , the available data are consistent with the picture that the largest concentration of quiescent molecular clouds such as the string of irdcs distributed in @xmath800   do not have a high density of 24@xmath0 m sources , h@xmath78o masers and ultracompact radio continuum sources @xcite .",
    "since most of the candidate ysos are distributed asymmetrically on the negative longitude side of the galactic center , we constructed another histogram of candidate ysos for @xmath81 .",
    "this histogram should be a better representation of the scale height of the uniformly distributed yso candidates .",
    "gaussian fits to the narrow and broad components give fwhm@xmath82 centered at b=-2.4@xmath45 and fwhm@xmath83 centered at @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "the scale height of the yso candidates in l@xmath85 is @xmath866.3 pc is similar to @xmath87 pc when all the sources at both positive and negative longitudes are included .      to examine the distribution of yso candidates as a function of latitude , a histogram was made using the data from the central 2.6@xmath88 .",
    "figure [ fig:17]a shows a broad and narrow component .",
    "the broad and narrow components are fitted with two gaussians .",
    "the broad component is centered near @xmath89 with a fwhm=@xmath90 whereas the narrow component is displaced with respect to the galactic plane at @xmath91 with a fwhm@xmath92 .",
    "figure [ fig:17]b shows the distribution of the candidate ysos when they are restricted to @xmath93 .",
    "this distribution is consistent with the narrow latitude distribution of yso candidates with an offset with respect to the galactic equator near @xmath94 .",
    "this value is likely to be close to the true latitude of the galactic plane since sgr a * , the massive black hole at the galactic center , lies at @xmath95 . unlike the broad distribution that is likely due to foreground sources toward the galactic center",
    ", the narrow distribution of the candidate ysos suggests a uniform sample of sources located along the midplane of the galactic center .",
    "the scale height of the candidate ysos is estimated to be @xmath867 pc assuming the distance to the galactic center is 8.5 kpc .",
    "molecular line observations of this region based on cs ( 1 - 0 ) transition also finds a narrow scale height @xmath96 pc @xcite . the narrow scale height of both candidate ysos and molecular clouds can be used as a support for the association of infrared sources and the disk population of molecular gas distributed in the galactic center region . to test that the reddest sources belong to a population of ysos distributed in the midplane of the galactic center region ,",
    "the yso candidates from the color - magnitude diagrams of figures 6 and 7 are presented in two dimensional histograms in figures 8c and 8d to emphasize the higher fraction of brighter , redder yso candidates within @xmath97 10  and the exterior region @xmath47 10  , respectively .",
    "these cmds are selected from the point source catalogs .",
    "the fraction of redder yso candidates with [ 8]-[24 ] @xmath98 3 , relative to the total number of sources in the inner 10@xmath45 is found to be a factor of five to ten higher than the region beyond the inner 10 .",
    "this suggests that there are more red ysos in proportion to the total ysos detected for the innermost region of the galactic center than those found in the outermost region .",
    "there are 1720 yso candidates , 599 of which are in the region restricted to @xmath99 and @xmath100 ; there are 347 and 252 sources distributed in the negative and positive longitudes , respectively .",
    "to compare the scale heights of candidate ysos and the bright 24@xmath0 m point sources , we constructed figure [ fig:18]a which shows the distribution of bright unsaturated 24@xmath0 m sources between 0 and 5 magnitudes as a function of latitude within @xmath101 .",
    "the narrow and wide components reflect the scale height of all bright stars which include both the evolved dusty stars and yso candidates .",
    "the fitted values give two components with fwm@xmath102 and 96@xmath45 , both of which are broader than those of the candidate yso s . to measure the scale height of the bright dusty stars without being contaminated by the yso candidates",
    ", we subtracted the candidate ysos and determined the latitude distribution of dusty sources .",
    "two components were fitted with fwhm@xmath103 and 105@xmath104 .",
    "the scale height of the narrow and bright component corresponds to a value of @xmath105 pc .",
    "the higher values of the scale heights of bright dusty sources compared to yso candidates suggest they are more evolved dynamically than the ysos .",
    "an important implication of these scale heights is the support for a new population of ysos distributed in the galactic center region .    using the mosaic image based on the combined msx and mips data",
    ", we also constructed the brightness distribution of 24@xmath0 m emission as a function of latitude and longitude .",
    "figure [ fig:18]b shows the latitude distribution where two broad and narrow components are detected .",
    "the broad background emission is subtracted followed by a gaussian fit to the narrow component , giving a fwhm@xmath106 which corresponds to a scale height of @xmath107 pc .",
    "this value is slightly thicker than the scale height of candidate ysos having @xmath108 pc but close to the scale height of molecular gas @xmath109=10 pc .",
    "the fit to the broad component gives fwhm=@xmath110 , representing the scale height of bright sources in the disk distributed along the line of sight .",
    "to examine the brightness distribution of point sources for a given flux , we plot the brightness distribution of 24@xmath0 m sources as a function of longitude and present the results in three different panels in figure [ fig:19 ] .",
    "the flux of selected yso candidates range between 0 - 5 , 5 - 7 and 7 - 10 magnitudes corresponding to bright , intermediate and faint sources in the entire region of the 24@xmath0 m survey but restricted only to within @xmath70 .",
    "such a tight latitude restriction most likely selects the sources that populate the galactic plane .",
    "it is clear that the brightest 24@xmath0 m sources show a stronger asymmetry in longitude , as shown in figure [ fig:19]a , when compared to the distribution of fainter sources , as shown in figure [ fig:19]b , c .",
    "the faintest stars dominate at greater longitudes but are not detected in the innermost region of the galactic center .",
    "this is because of the confusion and the saturation caused by the extremely strong background .",
    "these distributions indicate that the brightest 24@xmath0 m point sources exhibit an excess at negative longitudes similar to that seen in the candidate ysos .",
    "the fainter 24@xmath0 m sources seem to be uniformly distributed .",
    "one of the difficulties in identifying ysos by selecting them from 824@xmath0 m color magnitude diagrams is the contamination by dusty and bright agb stars . in addition",
    ", ysos can populate left of the cmd line as well ( as seen in figs .",
    "6 & 7 ) . in order to have more confidence in identifying yso candidates and to characterize their properties",
    ", we obtained the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of selected number of yso candidates using measurements at eight wavelengths from 1.24@xmath0 m to 24@xmath0 m in order to determine the evolutionary phases .",
    "the sed fitting technique is motivated by physical models and determines the physical properties of the sources .",
    "this technique is used for further refinement of the list of yso candidates based on the cmd technique with its ad hoc distinctions in color .",
    "the seds of the sources are analyzed by comparing to a set of seds produced by a large grid of yso models @xcite .",
    "we use a linear regression fitter @xcite to find all seds from the grid of models that are fit within a specified @xmath111 range to the data .",
    "the @xmath111 of the fit depends on the errors assumed for the data .",
    "we set lower limits on the fractional flux error ( df / f ) to be 20% to account for variability between the 2mass , irac and mips observation dates .",
    "the minimum reduced @xmath111 for each source is determined .",
    "for all the models with a reduced @xmath111 within 1 of the minimum value , physical parameters corresponding to those models are averaged along with their standard deviations .",
    "the models are not always well - constrained due to the incomplete sed information ( many lower and upper limits and relatively few overall data points ) . however ,",
    "this averaging is constrained by the finite extent of the grid of models .",
    "we carried out our search for candidate ysos toward two regions , using sed fitting of sources selected from cmds .",
    "one is a small cluster of 24@xmath0 m sources at g359.43 + 0.02 and the other is the candidate ysos distributed within @xmath64 and @xmath112 .",
    "we caution that the cmd selection biases us to redder sources .",
    "in addition , we have employed conservative errors in the sed fitting .",
    "robitaille et al .",
    "( 2006 ) defined three evolutionary stages based on their derived model properties , analogous to the classification based on the observed sed slope @xcite : stage  i objects have envelope infall rate @xmath113yr@xmath5 , stage  ii objects have @xmath114yr@xmath5 and @xmath115 , and stage  iii objects have @xmath114yr@xmath5 and @xmath116 .",
    "that is , stage i objects are young protostars embedded in an opaque infalling envelope . in stage",
    "ii objects the envelope has mostly dispersed , and the central star is surrounded by an opaque disk . in stage iii the disk is optically thin .",
    "it is not clear if there is a long - lived disk stage ( stage ii ) in high - mass sources , or if the disk is dispersed with the envelope .",
    "there are good reasons for the conservative ( 20% ) error bars , but it means that stage ii and iii ysos with smaller ir excesses may fail to be distinguished from reddened stellar atmospheres .",
    "it is clear that the yso list will be incomplete and biased towards younger evolutionary stages , which are readily distinguishable from even dusty evolved stars .",
    "we discuss these two groups separately below and then estimate the star formation rate .",
    "a striking cluster of 24@xmath0 m sources lies about 8@xmath45 north of the sgr c complex g359.4 - 0.1 with its thermal and nonthermal radio continuum components . figure [ fig:20]a , b show grayscale images of g359.43 + 0.02 at 24@xmath0 m and 20 cm , respectively .",
    "this cluster of 24@xmath0 m source ( g359.43 + 0.02 ) is distributed in the region where the northern extension of the nonthermal radio filament of sgr c dominates the radio continuum emission . in spite of strong extended background emission from the nonthermal filaments ,",

    "the positions , the flux densities at 20 and 6 cm and the sizes of individual radio sources are listed in table 1 ; column 1 identifies the source number , columns 2 and 3 show the galactic coordinates , and columns 4 to 7 give the flux densities in mjy and the source sizes at 6 and 20 cm , respectively .",
    "these values are estimated by two - dimensional gaussian fits to individual compact radio sources at 6 and 20 cm .",
    "the finding chart for the radio and 24@xmath0 m sources is shown in figure [ fig:20]c .",
    "the crosses drawn on figure [ fig:20]a , c show the positions of radio continuum point sources whereas the circles drawn on figure [ fig:20]b , c show the position of compact 24@xmath0 m sources .",
    "because of the saturation of several 24@xmath0 m sources in this cluster , there are only two radio sources , as listed in table 1 , that have cataloged 24@xmath0 m counterparts .",
    "the cmd covered by the region shown in figure [ fig:20]a , b is shown in figure [ fig:20]d .",
    "a total of 28 candidate ysos is detected in the yso candidate region of figure [ fig:20]d .",
    "we selected these candidate ysos and fitted their seds .",
    "the sed fitting leads to the rejection of 10 sources as yso candidates .",
    "thus the total number of yso fitted sources is about 64% of the sources that are selected from cmds .",
    "the fraction of stage i objects is 78% of the total number of sed fitted sources .",
    "the rejected sources are likely to be evolved stellar sources , for which the model yso seds give poor fits .",
    "other reasons for rejecting sources could be i ) variability between irac and mips , ii ) errors in photometry , iii ) source confusion where multiple sources contribute and give an sed that is not well fit by a single yso model , iv ) bad extraction of data or v ) there are no correct models in the grid .",

    "these sources are assumed to be 8.5 kpc away with av values rangig between 5 and 50 magnitudes . given that 9 out of 18 of these have fewer than 5 data points , we note from from figure [ fig:21]a that the flux of most cluster members is elevated at 24@xmath0 m when compared to irac and 2mass data points .",
    "this supports the identification of these sources as ysos .",
    "the parameters of the fits to these 18 sources suggest that the masses of the individual protostars range between 5 and 11.7  with corresponding luminosities ranging between 6.5@xmath117 and 10@xmath51 .",

    "there were many fits that did not go through the data points when a value of 2 was selected . on the other hand ,",
    "when we used a value of 0.5 , there were not enough fits .",
    "thus , we visually selected fits with @xmath119 .",
    "av values rangig between 5 and 50 magnitudes .",
    "av restriction is unlikely to biase the results .",
    "it is restricting some of the less likely models from being included in the fitting .",

    ", we are getting more appropriate yso models to fit the source .",
    "the number of candidate ysos , as shown to the right in the cmds of figure [ fig:16]a is 347 and 212 distributed at negative and positive longitudes , respectively .",
    "these numbers are obviously lower limits due to the bright saturated background at 24@xmath0 m . sed fitting showed a total of 213 , 112 and 35 for stage i , ii , and iii sources .",
    "we note that @xmath120% of yso candidates are identified as stage i sources . when grouped by longitude , the total numbers of stage i , ii , and iii sources are 131 , 69 , 23 at l@xmath121 whereas 82 , 43 , 12 sources are distributed at l@xmath122 , respectively .",

    "the total stellar mass in the cluster is estimated to be @xmath124 . assuming a distance @xmath125 kpc , sed fitting to a sample of 18 sources yields masses ranging from 8 to 20  and classifies 14 candidates in stage i , three in stage ii and one in stage iii .",
    "this result suggests that the majority ( nominally 78% ) are stage i ysos , which have stellar ages @xmath126 years and masses in excess of 8 . or low - mass stars , the canonical age for a class i source for low - mass stars is thought to be 1 - 5@xmath127 years .",

    "the sed fitting of ysos confirms a 10@xmath6 year duration of star formation because the number of stage i yso candidates dominates over stage ii and iii ysos .",
    "this implies an asymmetric star formation rate with respect to the galactic center .",
    "the cause of this asymmetry could be due to a short - lived random event causing a lop - sided star formation rate or it might be due to a more stable structure , possibly related to the bar .",

    "the distances to many of the 4.5@xmath0 m excess sources are unknown due to the difficulty in estimating the kinematic distances of sources in the direction toward the galactic center .",

    "thus , unlike the rest , these sources are unlikely to be accreting ysos .",
    "the correlation of 4.5@xmath0 m sources and irdcs is strong and is consistent with recent analysis by chambers et al .",

    "we adopt , as in section 5.3 , a standard broken power - law form of the imf @xcite to estimate on going star formation rate based on sed fitted 4.5@xmath0 m excess sources .",
    "we believe these excess sources trace the earliest phase of star formation . given a large uncertainty in the completeness of 4.5@xmath0 m sources , the integrated mass of stage i sources using kroupa imf , as before , is estimated to be @xmath1 522 .",
    "assuming that typical age of 4.5@xmath0 m excess sources is @xmath155 to @xmath129 years , we estimate sfr 0.017 to 0.009 yr@xmath5 , respectively . given the vast amount of dense molecular gas corresponding to @xmath156  residing in the galactic center region ,",
    "the efficiency of star formation is estimated to be @xmath157 yr@xmath5 .",
    "a more robust approach to estimate sfr , as discussed earlier in section 5.3.2 , is to use the evidence for a population of stage i yso candidates in the nuclear disk and make an estimate of the sfr@xmath10.14 yr@xmath5 in the last 10@xmath6 years . the star formation rate during this period appears to be an order of magnitude higher that that estimated from 4.5@xmath0 m excess sources .",
    "these excess sources are in an earlier phase of their evolution and are younger than 10@xmath6 years .",
    "to estimate the sfr from young stellar objects older than 10@xmath6 years , we used 24@xmath0 m flux density .",

    "lastly , nonthermal radio emission can be used as another proxy to determine sfr .",
    "this sfr probably applies to conditions some tens of millions of years ago ( helou & bicay 1993 ) .",
    "the flux density of nonthermal emission is estimated to be 800 jy at 6 cm .",
    "if we extrapolate this flux to 21 cm flux assuming a power law spectral index of 0.8 , we derive a luminosity at this wavelength of 61.2 l@xmath132 .",
    "this then yields a sfr of 0.007 m@xmath132 yr@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "taken together the above estimates provide a reasonable picture of large - scale star formation activity in the nuclear disk .",
    "we suggest that the region within @xmath163 pc of the galactic center was in a very quiescent state @xmath7 years ago , and that the sfr has been rising slowly , peaking to a value of 0.14 m@xmath132 yr@xmath5 around 10@xmath6 years ago and then perhaps falling since then to the current value of @xmath10.01 m@xmath132 yr@xmath5 .      a motivation for this work has been to test the influence of the extreme ism conditions in the central 400 pc of the milky way on the process of star formation .",

    "2006 ) but can be explained in terms of a relatively low rate of star formation in the past .",
    "the properties of the individual forming massive stars also are consistent with those of similar objects elsewhere in the galaxy .",

    "if this law holds between the disk and center of the milky way , it would be strong evidence that the high interstellar gas temperatures in the latter region do not fundamentally alter the manner in which stars form there .",
    "fuchs et al . (",

    "this average is in good agreement with our measurements of the recent sfr and suggests that the variations represent fluctuations around this average .",

    "many of the irdcs lie within a `` bow - tie '' structure , consisting of two layers parallel to the galactic equator and at both positive and negative longitudes .",

    "the preponderance of stage i yso candidates implies that massive star formation took place in the nuclear disk about @xmath129 years ago .",
    "the derived scale heights of the population of yso candidates ( @xmath87 pc ) as well as that of the molecular layer ( @xmath96 pc ) suggest their being dynamically young .",
    "these measurements are consistent with a highly efficient burst of high mass star formation in the nuclear disk about 10@xmath6 years ago .",
    "this aspect of the study characterizes the unique nature of the galactic center region , apart from the general galactic disk .",

    "future study of this region with its steep gravitational potential provides a testing ground for large - scale formation of massive stars and/or star clusters .",
    "finally , we explored an independent means of identifying yso candidates by finding sources with excess 4.5 @xmath22 emission , indicating the presence of shocked molecular emission from protostellar sources .",

    "this 4.5@xmath0 m excess source has a 24@xmath0 m counterpart , as shown in figure [ fig:26]a and lies within an arc - minute of an extended 8@xmath0 m and 24@xmath0 m hii source g1.05 - 0.071 at l=1@xmath172 , b=@xmath173 .",

    "the correlation of submillimeter emission , irdc , 24@xmath0 m point source and excess 4.5@xmath0 m emission is consistent with g3 being a massive yso associated with an active core .",
    "+ the largest concentration of 4.5@xmath0 m excess sources is located in sgr b2 , which is one of the most massive star forming sites in the galaxy . sed fits to the five 4.5@xmath0 m excess sources g6 to g10 give the highest protostellar masses among the 4.5@xmath0 m excess sources , ranging between 8 and 22 .",

    "it is clear that the irdc associated with sgr b2 is traced remarkably well by submillimeter and molecular line emission from several active molecular cores @xcite .",
    "the distribution of compact hii regions , as shown best at 20 cm wavelength , indicates that they lie at the southern edge of the dark cloud .",
    "the distribution of uc hii regions as well as 24@xmath0 m sources suggests a later phase of massive star formation at the southern edge of irdc where uc hii regions are concentrated .",

    "figure [ fig:27]c makes this point even clearer by showing that most of the methanol sources are displaced with respect to 24@xmath0 m sources heated by uc hii regions lie at the edge of the irdc . the high column density of sgr b2 and the saturation of the brighter 24@xmath0 m sources are likely responsible for a lack of additional detection of 4.5@xmath0 m excess sources and yso candidates in sgr b2 .",
    "nevertheless , the projected displacement between 24@xmath0 m sources and methanol sources is consistent with a picture that star formation in the irdc associated with sgr b2 has taken place from outside in .",

    "the parameters of the sed fit to g9 should be considered with caution , given that multiple sources could contribute to the sed .",
    "fortunately , the flux from a cluster of massive stars is likely to be dominated by the most massive star as luminosity is a steep power of mass and thus the assumption of all the luminosity arising from a single cluster member is reasonable .",
