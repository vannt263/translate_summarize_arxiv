    "intensive experimental and theoretical work done in the last decade led to significant advances in the field of electric transport through molecules and nanostructures @xcite . from the theoretical side , ab initio approaches",
    " mostly based on ground state density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations combined with the keldysh nonequilibrium green s functions ( negf )  contributed to a qualitative understanding of some trends important for molecular electronics @xcite .",
    "however , intrinsic limitations of the dft - approaches make it impossible to quantitatively describe electronic transport in correlated molecular systems .",
    "there is a broad consensus in attributing the rather large quantitative discrepancies between the calculated and measured currents to the notorious fact that the dft substantially underestimates the excitation energies , in particular the homo - lumo gap . in order",
    "to more appropriately account for electron correlation effects on nanotransport , several studies , which also used the negf , focused their attention on other methods , e.  g. , the so - called gw approximation @xcite , a method proposed long time ago for metals @xcite .",
    "the theory of electric transport through correlated molecular systems ( i.  e. , which can not be described within a single - particle picture ) is confronted with problems , which are not encountered in the absence of electron correlations .",
    "a basic issue is that of partitioning the real system into electrodes and the molecule @xcite . in the uncorrelated case",
    ", the electric current can be computed _ exactly _ within the landauer approach .",
    "being exact , the result is partition - independent , and therefore the specification of the electrode - molecule interfaces used in calculations is not important . for physical reasons ,",
    "the current through a correlated molecular system should also be partition - independent . excepting for a few models , the calculations on the transport in correlated systems are not exact .",
    "the various approximation schemes employed do not necessarily satisfy this partition invariance .",
    "we are not aware of a systematic study addressing this issue . in most cases ,",
    "the reported results are from calculations carried out for the largest extended molecule that can be tackled , wherein besides the molecule itself the largest possible electrode portions linked to it are included .",
    "the main concern of the most elaborate theoretical approaches of the correlated molecular transport developed so far is not the partition invariance or , alternatively , the independence on the size @xmath0 of the extended molecule .",
    "one is merely interested whether the employed approximate approach is current conserving or not , i.  e. , whether the calculated steady - state current does depend or not on the position in the extended molecule of the cross - sectional area through which it flows @xcite .    to summarize ,",
    "a reliable approach of the transport in correlated molecular systems should not only yield a steady - state current that does not depend on the transverse areas at @xmath1 , but also on the way in which the extended molecule is delimited by the various rectangles , as schematically depicted in fig .",

    "ultimately , the above physical assumption of a sufficiently large extended molecule is justified by just the problem that one wants to describe .",
    "if the opposite were true , the separation in uncorrelated left and right electrodes , and an extended ( possibly strongly ) correlated molecule would be impossible , and the problem would be no longer that of the transport through a single molecule .    practically , it is important that the extended molecule be not too large , such that accurate ab initio quantum - chemical calculations to correlated molecules of sizes @xmath28 be feasible . as any approximation , the present approach also has a limited applicability . importantly is however that",

    "this is the reason we employed in the dyson equation ( [ eq - dyson - work ] ) the bare self - energies @xmath189 and @xmath190 , as in the negf - dft approach .",
    "however , at variance with the latter , our approach accurately accounts for molecular electron correlations , which are included via the green s function @xmath57 of a sufficiently large extended molecule .",
    "because our method is based on the exact green s function @xmath57 ( whose counterpart for real molecules is a green s function computed by accurately including electron correlations within appropriate ab initio methods ) , it is clear that it will provide more reliable results than negf - dft s .    to give support to the intuitive physical reason underlying the concept of a sufficiently large extended molecule , we have presented numerical results deduced within a non - trivial correlated model .",
    "based on them , we argue that the present approach is able to provide results , which are interesting for the transport in correlated molecular systems . to this aim , the essential prerequisite is the ability to accurately compute the green s function @xmath123 of the _ isolated _ extended molecule .",
    "fortunately , this can be regarded as a feasible computational task .",
    "such green s functions were already obtained by means of the lanczos algorithm within the adc @xcite .",

    "importantly , although these methods are much more accurate than the currently considered gw , the computational effort is not much larger ; it scales as @xmath193 within adc(2 ) and as @xmath194 within gw , where @xmath195 is the number of atomic orbitals @xcite .",
    "the difference between the present approach and the usual negf - approaches to correlated transport @xcite can be discussed by inspecting the parenthesis of the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ eq - dyson - corr ] ) . in our case , this parenthesis becomes negligibly , and the difficulty to acount for correlations is to accurately tackle a sufficiently large extended molecule .",
    "if we considered the true ( small ) molecule and neglected that parenthesis , we would make an approximation similar to the so - called elastic cotunneling approximation @xcite .",
    "then , the current would be ( rather poorly ) approximated by eq .",
    "( [ eq - i ] ) @xcite .",
    "this amounts to take @xmath196 @xcite , which as seen by inspecting figs .",
    "[ fig : unitlim ] , [ fig : g - sc ] , and [ fig : g_asym ] , is not a good approximation .",
    "our approach goes beyond the elastic cotunneling approximation , it accounts for all higher - order processes within the _ extended _ molecule .",
    "other negf - approaches to correlated transport @xcite ( which are also beyond the elastic cotunneling ) adopt a different standpoint : they consider the true ( small ) molecule linked to electrodes and the evaluate the aforementioned parenthesis ( which does not vanish ) by certain keldysh diagrammatic approximations @xcite .",
    "recent studies often employ the gw approximation @xcite .",
    "results obtained within the gw approximation are certainly of interest @xcite , although limitations and artefacts are also significant @xcite .",
    "methodologically , the weak point of this approach is the fact that its physical content is hard to understand .",
    "thus , it is difficult to assess a priori its validity for a real case .",
    "the attempt to benchmark the gw approximation against exact results _ for transport _ led to ambiguous conclusions @xcite . within this framework ,",
    "both important effects ( i.  e. , intramolecular correlations and molecule - electrode coupling ) are treated in an approximate manner .",
    "consequently , it is difficult to conclude which of them is better or worse approximated .",
    "it makes more sense to benchmark the gw approximation for those isolated extended molecules , wherein electron correlations play an important role , and which are also employed in transport experiments .",
    "recent studies in this direction are significant , but only considered atoms and very small molecules so far @xcite .    in introduction",
    ", we mentioned that the results for transport should be partition independent .",
    "obviously , within the present approach , where correlations in distant parts of electrodes are neglected , the partition independence means and is demonstrated by the fact that , by making the extended molecule larger than a certain size @xmath197 , the results do not ( notable ) change . regarding the size-(in)dependence of the results of other approaches to correlated molecular transport , attention should be paid to the following important aspect .",
    "the fact that calculations accounting approximately for electron correlations ( like dft s or gw s ) yield results that saturate with increasing @xmath0 , does not _ necessarily _ imply that they are physically meaningful .",
    "the saturation could be a mathematical artefact , because such approximative methods become poorer at larger sizes and can not reliably describe subtle correlations basically localized within the molecule in a system including larger and larger parts of _ uncorrelated _ electrodes .",
    "correlation effects at larger sizes are likely underestimated , and this renders a correlated system resembling more an uncorrelated one , wherein the size - dependence is absent ( cf .",
    "[ sec - introduction ] ) , and hence the aforementioned saturation . on the contrary ,",
    "if molecular correlations can be accounted for by means of an accurate green s function @xmath57 of an isolated and sufficiently large extended molecule , size - independent results can be trusted : they indicate that correlations are negligible at the interfaces between electrodes and the extended molecule .",
    "the present numerical results indicate that the extended molecules to be employed for carrying out accurate ab initio quantum chemical calculations need not be very large . particularly attractive is the case of organic conducting electrodes , for which only a few electrode layers have to be included ( cf .",
    "[ sec - organic ] ) .",
    "another advantage is that , without metal atoms , ab initio calculations are less demanding . for metallic electrodes ,",
    "more electrode layers need be included ( cf .  sect .",
    "[ sec - metal ] ) , but one can still hope to a semi - quantitative description . alternatively , simpler ( tight - binding ) models can be utilized to include metallic electrode layers and their coupling to the molecule as well , similar to the first four terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq - h_m ] ) .",
    "regarding the case of metallic electrodes , it is still worth emphasizing the following aspect .",
    "experimental data indicate that electric conduction through molecules typically occurs by non - resonant tunneling , characterized by a rather large energy offset @xmath198 ( p - type conduction ) or @xmath199 ( n - type conduction ) @xcite , which represents the counterpart of the quantity @xmath200 in the presently employed model .",
    "this fact is important because , based on our calculations , we can state that the size dependence of the transport properties is particularly pronounced near resonance ( @xmath201 ) , but becomes much less significant away from resonance .",
    "this feature , which is visible if one inspects the unrenormalized curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : g - sc ] , is very encouraging : one can hope to obtain quantitatively correct results by using extended molecules with reasonable sizes even in the case of metallic electrodes .",
    "there is a general claim ( e.  g. , ref .  )",
    "that whether the electron transport is correlated or not solely depends on value of the ratio between the characteristic coulomb electron - electron interaction and the hybridization ( in our case @xmath170 ) . by comparing the results of sects .",
    "[ sec - organic ] and [ sec - metal ] among themselves , we found limitations of this rule of thumb @xcite .",
    "based on these results , one can conclude that the ratio @xmath170 alone is not sufficient to distinguish between significant and insignificant correlation effects on the transport . for large @xmath115 s ,",
    "significant effects arise at coulomb strengths @xmath119 substantially larger than @xmath202 , while for @xmath203 values @xmath158 suffice .    as mentioned from the very beginning ,",
    "the main interest of the present work was not to analyze the physical properties of a simple model ( i.  e. , irlm ) , to which all our numerical results refer .",
    "rather , we attempted to extract from them information , which is useful from the perspective of real systems of interest for molecular transport . nevertheless , in spite of its simplicity , we emphasize that the irlm incorporates a significant physical aspect , namely the coulomb repulsion at the contacts .",
    "concerning the physical relevance of the employed irlm , we also want to draw the attention on the following fact . to give support to the robustness of their theoretical results",
    ", many investigators mentioned that reasonable changes of the molecule - electrode distance @xmath204 do not notably alter the calculated transport properties .",
    "such a behavior can indeed be an indication for robust results , but it could also have a different origin . within the irlm , an increasing @xmath204 makes both parameters @xmath118 and @xmath119 to decrease .",
    "the decrease of @xmath118 always causes a conductance reduction . as already noted and visible by inspecting the renormalized curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : g_asym ] , depending on the range , a decrease in @xmath119 could either suppress or enhance the conductance .",
    "noteworthy , this effect brought about by a modification in @xmath119 can be observed on the _ renormalized _ curves . for realistic values of @xmath119(@xmath205 ) , the _ unrenormalized _ conductance increases with decreasing @xmath119 .",
    "so , rather than indicating robust results , the aforementioned behavior could be related to the fact that the size of the extended molecule employed in the calculations is too small , and for that size there is a compensation of two opposite effects induced by the @xmath118- and @xmath119-variations .    of course , we do not expect that in all cases the largest extended molecule that can be tackled is sufficiently large to justify neglecting the influence of electron correlations on the self - energies at the contacts . in sect .",
    "[ sec - renorm ] , we considered a renormalization scheme appropriate for the irlm , for which the exact conductance on resonance is known . to avoid misunderstandings , we emphysize that this scheme represents an _ extra _ renormalization , which solely accounts for the fact that the parentheses of eqs .",
    "( [ eq - dyson - corr ] ) and ( [ eq - dyson - work ] ) do not exactly vanish .",
    "the _ important _ renormalization ( the exact intramolecular correlations of the isolated extended molecule ) is already incorporrated in @xmath123 .",
    "simple schemes similar to our , which underline the renormalization considered in the landau fermi liquid theory , work pretty well even in kondo context ( see , e.  g. , the supplementary material of ref .  ) . certainly , the renormalization scheme of sect .",
    "[ sec - renorm ] can not be applied in an identical form in general .",
    "however , we think that the possibility to renormalize the green s function @xmath206 of the embedded molecule by an @xmath5-independent factor , which furthermore turned out to be ( practically ) independent on the model parameters , is interesting and deserves further attention .",
    "this ( almost ) constant factor can no more be determined from the unitary limit , as done in sect .",
    "[ sec - renorm ] , but one may think to determine it by using general properties of the green s functions ( e.  g. , sum rules or asymptotic behavior @xcite ) . the speculation on the existence of a ( nearly ) constant renormalization factor is also appealing from a different perspective . in the cases",
    "where the renormalization effect can be accounted for by an almost constant multiplicative factor of the green s function , the renormalized and unrenormalized curves for current or linear conductance roughly differ by a nearly constant scaling factor [ cf .",
    "( [ eq - i ] ) and ( [ eq - conductance ] ) ] .",
    "it is tempting to relate this to the fact that , in spite of substantial quantitative discrepancies , this is just the basic difference between the calculated and measure curves observed in some cases .",
    "in the present paper , we have presented a theoretical approach to correlated molecular transport relying upon a clear physical concept , namely that of a sufficiently large extended molecule .",
    "the analysis of the present numerical results obtained for a simple but non - trivial correlated case has indicated that this approach can be legitimately applied to the molecular transport in real systems .",
    "computing the green s functions within accurate quantum chemical calculations appears to be a feasible task for the isolated medium - size molecules needed .",
    "this is particularly true for narrower - band ( organic ) electrodes , but wider - band ( metallic ) electrodes can still be tackled especially in the most frequent situations of non - resonant tunneling . to remedy the stronger size - dependence for wider - band electrodes closer to resonance , we have suggested that simple renormalization procedures inspired by the landau fermi liquid theory can work , because it is unlikely that electron correlations in the systems of interest for molecular transport could invalidate the latter .",
    "although our main interest was not the irlm , we still note that the counter - intuitive theoretical prediction , that the contact electron - electron interaction could enhance the conductance , is interesting and can make the object of a parallel experimental investigation .",
