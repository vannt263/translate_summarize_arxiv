    "for many years , thermoelectric properties of various conductors have attracted both theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "these properties have also been investigated from practical standpoints . in this study , we are interested in thermoelectric transport properties of a charge density wave ( cdw ) system especially in connection with possible effects of collective modes .    as for electrical conductivity , a lot of studies on cdw system have been done until now .",
    "one of the dominant interest of such studies are focused on collective - mode contribution to conductivity .",
    "cdw has two collective modes- amplitude and phase modes .",
    "as is well known , phase mode can carry permanent currents in principle @xcite . in practice ,",
    "however , impurity and/or commensurability pinning prevent this phenomenon .",
    "some effects of phase mode have been found in experiments of nonlinear conductivity and frequency dependence of ac - conductivity .",
    "moreover , certain features of electrical dc - conductivity in cdw systems could be explained as many - body effects arising from nonlinear interaction between phase and amplitude modes @xcite .",
    "in contrast to electrical conductivity , theoretical study of thermal transport of this system has been rather rare .",
    "experimentally , evidence of collective mode current of thermoelectric power have been found on nonlinear response to electric field @xcite .",
    "some experimental data have also suggested fluctuation effect in thermal conductivity near transition temperature @xcite . at present , it is not easy to observe collective - mode contribution in thermoelectric response , especially at low temperatures .",
    "this is because of pinning effect which is seen in electrical conductivity as well .",
    "however , in principle , these effect should exist in this region , and indirect evidences are expected to be actually observed .",
    "theoretical study of this region is expected for better understanding of thermoelectric transports caused by collective modes .",
    "for these reasons , we investigate the collective mode response to thermoelectric power and thermal conductivity of this system by applying linear response theory to a microscopic model .",
    "we start from the frhlich hamiltonian @xmath0 here , electron - phonon interaction coefficient @xmath1 are assumed to be constant equal to the values at @xmath2 , since only the small portion of the phonon state are relevant in considering the cdw collective modes .",
    "we ingore electron spin indices for simplicity . adopting nambu representation@xcite ,",
    "we can rewrite the above hamiltonian as follows , @xmath3c^{\\dagger}(k+q)\\tau_{j}c(k),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 are pauli matrices , @xmath5 is the unit matrix , @xmath6 is fermi energy and @xmath7 summations are done in the range of @xmath8 and @xmath9 with respect to electron and phonon states .",
    "the term @xmath10 is comes from the quadratic dispersion .",
    "since transport phenomena are usually related to states near the fermi surface , linear dispersion relation is often adopted , espesially in one dimensional models .",
    "however , as far as thermoelectric transports are concerned , electron - hole asymmetry turns out to be important .",
    "it is because particles and holes respond to electric field in an opposite way : total energy flow vanishes if we have the exact electron - hole symmetry .",
    "electrical conductivity @xmath11 is given as follows @xmath12 where @xmath13 is temperature and @xmath14 is transport coefficient calculated from current - current correlation function using kubo - formula @xcite .",
    "similarly , thermoelectric power s and thermal conductivity @xmath15 are given by @xmath16,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is calculated from correlation function between current and heat current operator , and @xmath18 correlation function between heat current operators , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , for example .",
    "electric current operator is given by @xmath19 on the other hand , the heat current operator is composed of two parts : electron part and phonon part .",
    "historically , there are several forms that represent phonon part @xcite",
    ". such difference originates from various treatments of electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the following discussion is hardly affected by such differences . in this study , we give heat current operator of electron part as @xmath20 where , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are matsubara frequencies for fermions and bosons .",
    "note that , we need not to define heat current operator as @xmath23 since we have already chosen the fermi energy as the origen of energy .",
    "phonon part is also given by @xmath24,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is rewritten in @xmath25 where , both @xmath21 , and @xmath26 are boson matsubara frequencies .",
    "using above operators , transport coefficient , @xmath27 is given after usual analyitic continuation to real frequencies , by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is corresponding correlation funciton .    here , we restrict ourselves to low temperature region @xmath30 in the following discussion .",
    "peierls gap @xmath31 defined by @xmath32 is well - developed in this temperature range . under such conditions , @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "can be identified with the annihilation operators of the amplitude and phase modes of cdw .",
    "electron green s function in the mean field approximation is @xmath35 collective modes are described by the following green s functions @xmath36 here , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are displacement operators of amplitude and phase modes given by @xmath39 in the low energy region , above green s function can be written in @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is @xmath42 , @xmath43 is dimensionless coupling constant @xmath44 , @xmath45 is lattice constant , and @xmath46 is the cdw mass paramter .",
    "ordinarily it has quite large values typically on the order of @xmath47 .",
    "now let us calculate thermoelectric power . in this study , we have a interest to collective mode response ,",
    "so we do nt consider impurity effects .",
    "we also neglect effect of quasi - particles .",
    "needless to say , these have much effect in real systems , but at least , these contributions are expected to be vanished at low temperatures @xmath48 . damping is derived from nonlinear interaction between phase mode and amplitude mode , which had been developed by one of the author @xcite , yielding the following expression for the phason life time from fig . 1 @xmath49 where , @xmath50 .",
    "( [ lifetime ] ) shows that @xmath51 is inversely proportional to @xmath13 at temperatures above amplitude gap @xmath52 , and diverge exponentially in the zero temperature limit",
    ".     contributes to electric conductivity and thermoelectric power , while aslamazov - larkin diagrams @xmath53 contribute to electron part of thermal conductivity .",
    ", height=132 ]    in the previous paper @xcite , electrical conductivity @xmath11 is calculated from the diagram shown in fig.2 ( a ) , and is given by @xmath54 .",
    "this diagram also contributes to other transport coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we denote these contribution as @xmath55 and @xmath56 which are given by @xmath57 there is a factor @xmath58 in above two equations .",
    "this means that @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be non - vanishing only when the electron - hole symmetry is violated .",
    "it is derived from asymmetry between electric and heat current operators .",
    "note that , the factor @xmath58 is not necessarily small in cdw system : a typical value is on the order of 0.1 .    using eq .",
    "( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( [ l12 ] ) , see that the thermoelectric power is given by @xmath59 in the experiment on @xmath60 , field dependence of thermoelectric power corresponded to differential resistivity @xcite .",
    "this suggest that @xmath17 does nt have dependence on collective modes",
    ". however , in the system of the blue bronze , nonlinear field dependence of @xmath17 has observed at several temperatures @xcite . in this system , temperature dependence of thermoelectric power which is shown in eq .",
    "( 23 ) is expected to be observed under the high electric field : above the threshold .",
    "we also note that eq .",
    "( [ tep ] ) diverges at zero temperature , which may be an artifact of our assumption : we have ignored impurity effects and quasi particle contributions .",
    "thermal conductivity @xmath15 is composed of two parts .",
    "we denote the contribution of electron as @xmath61 and that of phonon as @xmath62    first , we investigate the electron part .",
    "we see that diagram shown in fig.2 ( a ) does nt contribute to collective mode response of thermal conductivity .",
    "actually we can easily confirm the relation @xmath63 from eq .",
    "( [ l121 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ l221 ] ) .",
    "this represents that phase mode transport which is damped by nonlinear interaction between phase mode and amplitude mode is completely canceled out by back flow , i.e. contribution of thermoelectric power and electric current , which is shown in eq .",
    "thus , we investigate other processes of the thermal conductivity . as for higher order diagrams ,",
    "we focus on aslamazov - larkin - type diagrams .",
    "note that maki - thompson and density of state diagrams are both important factor in considering the superconducting fluctuations .",
    "but these terms give no contribution in our case .",
    "we find that fig.2 @xmath53 give finite values to thermal conductivity , and the other diagrams vanish .",
    "as for electrical conductivity and thermoelectric power , all diagrams in this order do nt have finite value .    actual calculation of these diagrams is rather complicated .",
    "we calculate these terms by the following way .     and @xmath64 are momentum , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are matsubara frequency .",
    "@xmath67 is analytically continuated to @xmath68.,height=113 ]    summation of these terms are represented as @xmath69    \\label{ph - ap } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is number of lattice site , and @xmath71 , function @xmath72 is contribution of electron parts shown in fig .",
    "3 . as is shown in fig .",
    "3 , we have to consider two summations over matsubara frequencies @xmath65 and @xmath66 . however , we only pick up poles of green s functions of phonon with respect to @xmath66 , since we consider the temperature sufficiently below the cdw gap , and effect of quasi particle excitation is expected to be very small . in this assumption , transport coefficient derived from eq .",
    "( [ ph - ap ] ) is given by @xmath73 } \\label{ph - ap2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] function @xmath74 is still hard to calculate directly .",
    "however , we find @xmath75 .",
    "thus we use this value and finally find to be @xmath76    next , we calculate phonon part .",
    "we find eq .",
    "( [ phonon ] ) represents decay process between phase and amplitude mode , and it s correlation function is composed of product of green s function of phase mode and amplitude mode .",
    "we calculate one - loop contribution of thermal conductivity of phonon part which is given by @xmath77    @xmath61 is similar to @xmath62 , both of them are inversely proportional to phason life time @xmath51 .",
    "actually , we substitute @xmath78 with @xmath79 , then @xmath62 can be derived .",
    "we may consider that these heat currents are essentially same : they are carried by energy - interchange process between phase and amplitude modes .",
    "such interpretation is reasonable , because the heat transfer is process of entropy diffusion .",
    "if local amplitude mode excitation causes phase mode excitation and , thereafter phase mode bring about amplitude fluctuation in some other place , it is interpreted as heat current .",
    "finally we estimate the relative importance of these contributions to thermal conductivity . @xmath61 and @xmath62 has exponentially low value at temperatures sufficiently below amplitude gap while they have nearly constant value @xmath80 and @xmath81 at temperatures above it .",
    "ratio between these values and electrical conductivity for this temperature range is given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 is lorentz number @xmath84 , @xmath85 is boltzmann constant .",
    "since a factor @xmath86 is quite small which has an order of @xmath87 , electonic contribution is small . on the other hand ,",
    "phonon contribution is much larger , because @xmath88 is expected to have an order of 0.1 , where we estimate @xmath89 have an order of @xmath87 .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied thermoelectric properties of a charge density wave system .",
    "we have particularly focused on collective mode response . we have found temperature dependence of correlation function between electrical current and heat current is same as electrical conductivity , which means thermoelectric power is inversely proportional to temperature .",
    "we have also found that thermal conductivity is calculated by energy - interchange process between phase mode and amplitude mode , and is inversely proportional to phason life time .",
