    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) is conducting photometric and spectroscopic surveys over about @xmath3 steradians of the sky , producing a homogeneous data base of galaxies and other astronomical objects with accurate astrometric calibrations ( pier et al .",
    "2002 ) . the data published as _",
    "data release 1 _",
    "( dr1 ; abazajian et al .",
    "2003 ; see also http://www.sdss.org/dr1/index.html ) comprise 2196 sq .",
    "deg . of sky , which is about 25% of the survey goal .",
    "one of the most important features of the sdss is its homogeneous photometry by virtue of a large format mosaic ccd camera ( gunn et al .",
    "1998 ) , and real - time calibration of the photometry using a 50 cm photometric telescope ( hogg et al . 2001 ) .",
    "in this paper we study the spatial variation of galaxy number counts observed in the photometric survey of the sdss .",
    "the causes of the spatial variation are ( i ) spatial variation of extinction due to the dust in the galaxy , ( ii ) large - scale structure of the universe , and ( iii ) errors of photometric calibrations , especially those for stripe to stripe ( or segments of stripes ) , since the observations are carried out along great circle scans ( york et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the prime motivation of the present work is to investigate ( iii ) , but to acomplish this goal it is necessary to remove the effects of ( i ) and ( ii ) , both which have fundamental scientific significance .",
    "the most modern map of galactic reddening over the sky is that of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ; sfd ) , which was produced by merging the cobe / dirbe and iras / issa fir maps .",
    "the extinction curve is given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the reddening .",
    "an important aspect of our study is to examine whether @xmath6 correctly describes extinction due to galactic dust .",
    "the most model - independent test for the extinction correction can be made with galaxy number counts ( e.g. , burstein & heiles 1982 ) .",
    "for this test , it is desirable to work with galaxy number counts as faint as possible , so that the galaxy density is sufficiently high and the distribution of galaxies is sufficiently smooth that large - scale clustering effects are small .",
    "we choose the range of magnitude as @xmath7 mag ( median redshift is 0.25 ) , which is reasonably faint , yet photometric measurements are made at a high signal to noise ratio and the star - galaxy classification is hardly affected by the variation of seeing in the photometric survey in the sdss .    even at this faint magnitude",
    "we expect the effect of large - scale clustering to be appreciable .",
    "the importance of the effect , however , can be predicted from the angular two - point correlation function ( connolly et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the spatial variations in galaxy number counts that remain after subtraction of galactic extinction and large - scale structure may be ascribed to variations of the photometric calibration , which is made stripe by stripe , or its segments when the scan of the stripe was obtained over several nights .",
    "the challenge is to separate these three effects , which we shall consider in this paper .",
    "we show in table 1 the data used in the present analysis .",
    "stripes # 9@xmath812 are the northern equatorial stripe ( # 10 ) and neighbouring stripes , # 82 is the southern equatorial stripe , # 76 and # 86 are stripes in the southern sky , and the others are stripes in the northern hemisphere .",
    "the total area is 2196 sq .",
    "we use the data processed with the photometric pipeline version v5.3 , as given in dr1 .",
    "we refer to strauss et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for the selection of galaxies from the photometric catalogue .",
    "the galaxy catalogue thus produced contains a small fraction of fake objects at bright magnitude @xmath9 , but the contamination becomes negligible for fainter magnitudes which are considered in this paper ; see yasuda et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "a survey stripe is 2.52 deg wide ; scans can be up to 120 deg in length , and the stripe consists of a pair of tdi scan operations [ denoted by ( n , s ) in table 1 ] to fill the gaps between ccd chips .",
    "the imaging is made with the sdss @xmath10 filters ( fukugita et al . 1996 ) .",
    "we work primarily with the @xmath11 band data .",
    "we divide the stripe into square regions of 2.5 deg@xmath12 along the stripes , and count galaxies contained in these square regions .",
    "the number of galaxies with @xmath13 mag contained in a square is approximately 11700 ; therefore the poisson noise is about 0.4% ( the corresponding magnitude offset , @xmath14 mag , is negligible for this work ) .",
    "we first derive the differential number count @xmath15 from the entire sample employing the reddening map of sfd and the default standard extinction law ( explained below ) .",
    "we then calculate the number count for each @xmath16 square region without applying the extinction correction , and using the reference count curve @xmath17 with magnitude offset @xmath18 , we fit it to the four data points in the range @xmath7 mag devided into 0.5 mag bins by adjusting @xmath18 with a chi - squares fit .    we show in figure 1 @xmath18 versus galactic extinction , @xmath19 , calculated from the reddening map of sfd assuming @xmath20 from the standard extinction curve ( sfd ; odonnell 1994 ; see also cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ; fitzpatrick 1999 ) and calculating the mean of extinction over the @xmath21 region .",
    "the individual data points and their binned mean in @xmath19 are plotted .",
    "the error bars show the rms scatter .",
    "although the scatter is significant , there is a clear trend that the mean of @xmath18 and @xmath22 are nearly identical , showing that the observed variation of galaxy counts is primarily due to galactic extinction .",
    "hence we may identify @xmath23 .",
    "unfortunately , the scatter is so large compared to the fitting range of the abscissa that it is not possible to perform a two - parameter fit .",
    "so we first fit the data ( using all data points ) to determine the slope , enforcing that the curve passes through the origin ( as the plot indicates ) , and then vary the constant while the slope is fixed .",
    "the fit yields @xmath24 and the zero point that gives @xmath25 minimum is 0.007@xmath260.005 .",
    "the constant term is sufficiently small that it can be ignored . the measured slope verifies the @xmath27 from the standard extinction law together with the reddening map of sfd to an accuracy of 5% .",
    "the rms scatter around the line is 0.096 mag .",
    "a similar analysis is made for the @xmath0 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath1 colour bands .",
    "we selected the magnitude ranges of 18.5@xmath820.5 for @xmath0 and @xmath28 , 18.0@xmath820.0 for @xmath29 and 17.5@xmath819.5 for @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting plots are presented in figure 2 .",
    "the slope of the @xmath25 fits and the dispersion around the curves as normalised by @xmath30 are summarised in table 2 . for",
    "all colour bands @xmath31 does not deviate from @xmath30 by more than @xmath325% .",
    "note , however , that our test is limited to the sky with small reddening of @xmath2 ( the sdss is designed to avoid high extinction fields ; see york et al .",
    ".    we may use @xmath31 to derive a constraint on the @xmath33 parameter that represents total - to - selective extinction .",
    "the extinction curves of cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and their updates given by odonnell ( 1994 ) contain the parameter @xmath34 [ @xmath35 which is related to the greyness of the dust . using odonnell s extinction curve , which is given by the form @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 functions of @xmath39 , we can derive constraint on @xmath34 , for example @xmath40 from the @xmath11-band .",
    "the constraints on @xmath34 from other colour bands are given in table 2 .",
    "all constraints are consistent with @xmath41 to 3.2 .    before we discuss the issue of the scatter around the relation",
    ", we examine the reddening in the colour of galaxies for a consistency check .",
    "figure 3 shows @xmath42 colour of galaxies at the fifth percentile from the reddest as a function of @xmath5 predicted by sfd .",
    "the trend of reddening against @xmath5 is evident .",
    "the binned data points agree with the line @xmath43const .",
    ", which is expected from the standard reddening law .",
    "a further consistency test is given in figure 4 , where @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , which is derived from the extinction detected in the number count data , is plotted against @xmath46 calculated from fugure 3 .",
    "the plot is consistent with @xmath47 ( indicated by the dotted line ) , although the scatter is large and we see some data points that are scattered into the negative regions .",
    "note that this figure shows a consistency of reddeing and extinction derived solely using the galaxy data , independent from the external data of @xmath5 from galactic far infra - red emission .",
    "the rms scatter observed in the previous section is larger , by an order of magnitude , than that expected from the poisson noise . to investigate whether the scatter is due to large - scale clustering of galaxies , we study the variation of galaxy counts in the @xmath11 band varying area sizes of sky regions .",
    "we define circles with radii @xmath48 along the stripes , and decrease the radius keeping the centres of the circles fixed .",
    "we count numbers of galaxies with @xmath7 grouped into four 0.5 mag bins contained in those circular areas after applying an extinction correction according to the sfd map [ assuming @xmath49 , and then calculate the corresponding magnitude offset @xmath50 in the same way as above .",
    "the rms scatter , @xmath50 , thus obtained is plotted as a function the area @xmath51 in figure 5 .",
    "the error bars show the poisson statistics .",
    "the rightmost point ( open square ) refers to the scatter observed in 2.5 deg square ( 6.25 sq .",
    "deg ) which was seen in the previous section .",
    "we also added one more point for 3 sq .",
    "deg ( open square ) for comparison .",
    "( the data for square areas give values about @xmath323% smaller than those for circular regions having the same area , as expected from the angular correlation function ; see below . )",
    "the size of @xmath50 is larger than the poisson noise at least by an order of magnitude . to study whether @xmath50 , which increases as the area size decreases ,",
    "can be attributed to the effect of large - scale clustering , we calculate the expectation from the empirical angular two - point correlation function @xmath52 .",
    "the fluctuations of the number of galaxies observed in area @xmath53 are given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the number of galaxies per unit solid angle .",
    "the rms of the count @xmath56 is translated to @xmath18 using @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the empirical slope of the count , @xmath59 , at the relevant magnitude range . the angular correlation function estimated by connolly et al .",
    "( 2002 ) from the analysis for the northern equatorial stripe of the sdss is @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 mag with the preliminary photometric calibration ( smith et al .",
    "2002 ; stoughton et al .",
    "this angular correlation function is consistent , within the errors , with earlier analyses ( stevenson et al .",
    "1985 ; maddox , efstathiou & sutherland 1990 ; couch , jurcevic & boyle 1993 ) .",
    "connolly et al . could show the power law only for @xmath64 .",
    "maddox et al . , showed that the correlation function shows a break at around 2 - 2.5@xmath65 from thier apm data .",
    "we , therefore , model the angular correlation function by a two - power law that breaks at 2@xmath65 , with the second power slope @xmath66 consistent with the apm result .",
    "figure 5 shows that the rms scatter of galaxy number counts in different parts of the sky after correcting for galactic extinction is consistent with that which is expected from the angular two - point correlation function integrated over circular areas .",
    "this means that a significant scatter around the extinction fits of figures 1 and 2 is produced by large - scale clustering of galaxies .",
    "we now investigate the residual spatial variation of galaxy number counts integrated over segments of the stripes ( some of the runs are merged ) given in table 1 .",
    "figure 6 shows the offset after the extinction correction @xmath50 calculated from the galaxy counts for specific segments of the stripes relative to the reference count .",
    "the error bars represent the standard deviation expected from the two - power model of the angular correlation function with a cut - off at @xmath67 in the integral ( [ eq:1 ] ) over the rectangular region of the segment .",
    "the figure shows that the mean still scatters by @xmath68 mag , but the majority of the data are consistent with zero if we consider the variation expected from large - scale clustering , i.e. , 19 out of 32 data points are within 1 @xmath69 , and the maximum deviation is 1.6 @xmath69 .",
    "this implies a null detection of photometric calibration errors .",
    "we may make this statement more quantitative by applying the statistics in the following way .",
    "we estimate the likelihood that the observed @xmath50 distribution is consistent with the gaussian distribution of the dispersion @xmath70 , where @xmath71 represents the error , other than that from large - scale structure , that increases the dispersion .",
    "we then calculate the probability as a function of @xmath72 , and find that the probablity of the observed distribution being consistent with the gaussian at 68% confidence level ( 1 @xmath69 ) only when @xmath73 mag .",
    "this is taken as the upper limit on the error from photometry .",
    "this error meets the design requirement of the sdss photometry ; the global variation of the calibration error is no more than random errors of photometry .",
    "we do not carry out similar analyses for other colour bands , since the evaluation of the angular two - point correlation is only available in the @xmath11 bands .",
    "table 2 displays the continuous increase of the rms scatter from the @xmath1 to the @xmath0 band .",
    "since it is known that the photometric accuracy of the @xmath28 , @xmath11 , and @xmath29 bands are comparable ( dr1 ) , we would ascribe this increase to increasingly stronger large - scale correlation in bluer bands . for the @xmath0 band , random photometric errors ( @xmath74 mag ) may also contribute to the rms scatter , but they are smaller than the increase of the rms scatter we observed from the @xmath28 to the @xmath0 band .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated that the spatial variation of galaxy number counts are understood as the sum of galactic extinction and large - scale clustering of galaxies .",
    "the analysis verified the validity of the sfd extinction map and the standard extinction law from @xmath0 to @xmath1 band within 5% in regions of small reddening @xmath2 .",
    "we find that the @xmath34 parameter lies in the range 2.8@xmath83.2 for the extinction curve of odonnell ( 1994 ) .",
    "finally we do not detect systematic errors in the global sdss photometric calibration at least those in excess of 0.02 mag from run to run .",
