    "this so - called side - coupled geometry gives an opportunity to analyze non - stationary effects in formation of various charge and spin configurations in the small size structures @xcite,@xcite .",
    "lateral qds are extremely tunable by means of individual electrical gates @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this advantage reveals in the possibility of single electron localization in the system of several coupled dots @xcite and charge states manipulations in the artificial molecules . therefore lateral qds",
    "are considered to be an ideal candidates for creation of an efficient charge traps .",

    "qds were investigated theoretically by various methods such as keldysh non - equilibrium green - function formalism @xcite , re - normalization group theory @xcite , specific approach suggested by coleman @xcite , spin - density - functional theory @xcite or quantum monte - carlo calculations @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider charge relaxation in the system of @xmath0 interacting qds with on - site coulomb repulsion coupled to the reservoir ( continuous spectrum states ) .",
    "the analysis was performed by means of heisenberg equations for the localized electrons pair correlators .",
    "we demonstrated the presence of strong charge trapping effects for the lateral qds geometry .",
    "we found that on - site coulomb repulsion results in the significant changing of the localized charge relaxation and leads to the formation of several time ranges with strongly different values of the relaxation rates .",
    "we also pointed out the significant suppression of coulomb correlations influence on the localized charge relaxation with the increasing of dots number .",
    "let us consider relaxation processes in the system of @xmath0 identical lateral qds which are situated in the different space points and are connected only with the single - central qd by means of electron tunneling processes with the same tunneling transfer amplitudes @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that the single particle level spacing in the dots is large than all other energy scales , so that only one spin - degenerate level within the qd spectrum is accessible ( @xmath2 in the @xmath0 identical dots and @xmath3 in the central one ) .",
    "qd with energy level @xmath3 is also connected with the continuous spectrum states .",
    "moreover we take into account coulomb interaction between the localized electrons within the dots ( @xmath4-in the central one and @xmath5 in the surrounding dots ) .",
    "hamiltonian of the system under investigation has the form :    @xmath6    @xmath7 - tunneling amplitude between the single - central dot and continuous spectrum states .",
    "we assume @xmath1 and @xmath7 to be independent of momentum and spin . by considering a constant density of states in the reservoir @xmath8 ( which is not a function of energy ) ,",

    "we ll at first analyze filling numbers relaxation processes in the case when on - site coulomb repulsion is absent in the whole system ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "let us assume that at the initial moment all charge density in the system is localized only in one of the @xmath0 qds and has the value @xmath17 .",

    "let us analyze filling numbers time evolution in the central qd and in the dot with initial charge .",

    "@xmath63    simultaneously for the large number of qds @xmath0 , electron filling numbers in the qds reveal oscillations frequency increasing as @xmath64 .",

    "consequently one can get the following expressions for the charge time evolution :    @xmath67_{aa}n_{0a}[e^{-i\\widehat{\\widetilde{h}}t}]_{aa}\\nonumber\\\\ n_{j\\sigma}(t)=[e^{i\\widehat{h}t}]_{ja}n_{0a}[e^{-i\\widehat{\\widetilde{h}}t}]_{aj}\\ \\label{exp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the function @xmath68_{aa}}$ ] can be obtained from equation :    @xmath69_{ja}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    finally , solution will have the form :    @xmath70_{ja}}dt_{1}\\nonumber\\\\ \\psi=\\frac{nt^{2}}{2d}(\\frac{e^{iat}-e^{i(\\delta+i\\gamma)t}}{a-(\\delta+i\\gamma)}-\\frac{e^{ibt}-e^{i(\\delta+i\\gamma)t}}{b-(\\delta+i\\gamma)})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where coefficients @xmath52 , @xmath54 and @xmath50 are determined by the expressions ( [ 0 ] ) .",
    "consequently , the charge trapping effect is absent in this situation .",
    "we now consider the situation when coulomb interaction between localized electrons exists within the qds . in this case",
    "it is necessary to take into account the following interaction part of the system hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) :    @xmath71    where index @xmath72 and coulomb interaction values @xmath73 correspond to the central dot(surrounding dots ) .",
    "we ll take into account coulomb interaction by means of self - consistent mean field approximation @xcite .",
    "it means that the initial energy level value @xmath3 have to be substituted by the value @xmath74 in the final expressions for the filling numbers @xmath75 time evolution ( [ results ] ) .",
    "so one should solve self - consistent system of equations .    in the presence of coulomb interaction system of equations for pair correlators",

    ". then one can obtain the expressions :    @xmath84    where evolution operator @xmath85}$ ] is considered .",
    "so , one can get equations for the matrix elements of the evolution operator @xmath86    @xmath87    with initial conditions for the functions @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "if we are interested in the collective effects connected with the presence of large number of coupled qds @xmath0 , the coulomb interaction between localized electrons within the initially empty dots can be neglected , because the filling numbers amplitude is proportional to @xmath91 .",
    "so , taking into account only coulomb correlations within the dot with the initial charge , one can simplify the system of equations ( [ 3 ] ) in the following way :    @xmath92    system of equations ( [ 5 ] ) can be easily solved numerically and consequently one can analyze localized charge relaxation processes .",

    "the non - resonant tunneling between the dots is considered ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "it is clearly evident that filling numbers relaxation changes significantly with the increasing of qds number @xmath0 .",
    "when initial charge is localized in one of the @xmath0 qds it remains confined in the initial dot even in the presence of relaxation processes from the central dot to the reservoir for the large number of dots .",
    "when one considers two surrounding dots only twenty percent of charge continue being localized in the initial qd ( fig.[figure1a_1b]a ) .",
    "but for ten interacting qds more then eighty percent of charge is confined in the initial dot ( fig.[figure1a_1b]a ) .",
    "this effect can be called `` charge trapping '' and the proposed system of coupled qds can be considered as a `` charge trap '' .",
    "qds number @xmath0 increasing also leads to the decreasing of charge amplitude in the central qd @xmath59 for a fixed value of ratio @xmath94 due to the effective growth of tunneling coupling ( fig.[figure1a_1b]b ) .",

    "`` charge trapping '' effect is clearly evident with the increasing of qds number even in the presence of coulomb interaction between localized electrons ( fig.[figure2a_2d ] ) .    for two qds interacting with",
    "the central one coulomb correlations strongly influence on the filling numbers relaxation ( fig.[figure2a_2d]a ) . a critical value of on - site coulomb repulsion exists for a given set of system parameters which corresponds to the full compensation of the initial negative detuning @xcite .",
    "for the smaller values of coulomb interaction , correlations lead to the increasing of relaxation rate in the qd with the initial charge ( fig.[figure2a_2d]a grey line ) in comparison with the case when coulomb interaction is absent ( fig.[figure2a_2d]a black line ) , due to the decreasing of the initial detuning value . for the values of on - site coulomb repulsion larger than the critical one ,",
    "positive detuning occurs and filling numbers relaxation rate decreases as a result of positive detuning value increasing ( fig.[figure2a_2d]a black - dashed line ) .      with the increasing of qds number",
    "all the effects mentioned above are still valid , but they are less pronounced ( fig.[figure2a_2d]c ) .",

    "reveal significantly stronger influence on the filling numbers relaxation processes in comparison with the geometry when five dots are considered ( fig.[figure3a_3d]c ) .    again",
    "two typical relaxation regimes were revealed .",
    "the first one corresponds to the decreasing of initial negative detuning value . in this",
    "regime coulomb correlations lead to the increasing of relaxation rate in the qd with initial charge in comparison with the case when coulomb interaction is absent ( fig.[figure3a_3d]a grey and black lines correspondingly ) .",
    "the second one deals with the coulomb energy values large enough to compensate negative detuning and to form the positive one . in this regime filling numbers relaxation rate decreases as a result of positive detuning value increasing caused by the coulomb interaction ( fig.[figure3a_3d]a grey and black - dashed lines correspondingly ) .",
    "qds number increasing also results in the increasing of filling numbers oscillations frequency . filling numbers oscillations frequency for the small coulomb values",
    "decreases corresponding to the detuning decreasing and increases as a result of positive detuning formation ( fig.[figure3a_3d]a , c ) .",
    "we found the growth of charge amplitude in the central qd with the increasing of the dots number when the negative detuning value decreases and amplitude decreasing when positive detuning value increases ( fig.[figure3a_3d]b ) .",
    "when initial charge is localized in the central qd which is connected not only to the surrounding qds but also to the continuous spectrum states `` charge trapping '' effect does nt exist at all ( fig.[figure4a_4b ] ) .",
    "we now introduce the possible qds geometry which allows to perform an experimental observations of charge trapping effects within the single dot .",
    "the most simple configuration is : @xmath0 similar lateral qds interacting only with the single vertically aligned dot .",
    "single vertical dot is also connected to the continuous spectrum states . but",
    "this geometry reveals a problem of initial charge localization .",
    "initial charge can be localized in the single qd in the most simple way by means of the gate voltage .",

    "these @xmath0 dots interact only with the single central vertically aligned qd also connected to the continuous spectrum states .",
    "to conclude , we have analyzed time evolution of the electron filling numbers in the system of @xmath0 interacting qds both in the absence and in the presence of coulomb interaction between localized electrons within the dots .",
    "it was found that coulomb interaction modifies the relaxation rates and the character of localized charge time evolution .",
    "it was shown that several time ranges with considerably different relaxation rates arise in the system of coupled qds .",
    "we demonstrated and carefully analyzed the presence of strong charge trapping effects in the proposed systems .",
