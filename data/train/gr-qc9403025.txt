    "most of the gravitational properties of cosmic strings  @xcite and superconducting cosmic strings  @xcite have so far been calculated in the special framework of zero  @xcite or time independent currents  @xcite so that it is widely believed that observation of strings in the universe might be achieved through the now well known double image effect , i.e. the deflection associated with the missing angle in the conical metric surrounding a string .",
    "an interesting observation would therefore consist in two exactly identical stars ( or galaxies ) separated by a fixed angle ( usually assumed of the order @xmath1rad",
    "@xmath2 , i.e. , for strings generated at the grand unified phase transition ) , or perhaps an aligned series of such twin images  @xcite .",
    "however , because the probability that two nearly identical stars be separated in the sky by pure coincidence in exactly the way one expects for cosmic strings is rather high , there is in fact a demand for a more convincing signature .",
    "as we shall see , a lightlike current may in principle provide such a signature .    in this paper , we study the gravitational field created by a lightlike current - carrying string . for the case of timelike and spacelike currents , which have been studied before  @xcite ,",
    "all known solutions are stationary  @xcite . in the lightlike case ,",
    "however , we shall see that the stationary solution has peculiar asymptotic behaviour , in the sense that all light rays are gravitationally bound by the string .",
    "therefore , the problem of asymptotic light deflection is not well posed in this metric .",
    "this is just as well , since in realistic situations , we do not expect the current to be stationary . in particular we can consider a pulse of lightlike current travelling along the string at the speed of light .",
    "such pulses may be generated when a long string interacts with a bounded external source . in this case , the motion of the double image with time due to the nonstationary gravitational field must be examined .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in a first section , we derive the metric surrounding a lighlike current carrying cosmic string by boosting a spacelike current metric , and show how the resulting gravitational field can be generalized to a time - dependent exact solution of the einstein - maxwell equations . in section  [ wit ]",
    "we address the question of finding the corresponding solutions in the underlying field theoretic model . for definiteness , we use the bosonic witten model  @xcite coupled to gravity .",
    "we show that the introduction of a lightlike current does not modify the vortex profile .",
    "also , the effect of the current on the metric is accounted for by means of a single function which satisfies a linear differential equation . in order to understand the effect of a lightlike current on a possible observation of light deflection by a string , we use the fact that our solution can in fact account for time - varying fields , so we consider a finite pulse of such a current .",
    "we then work out analytically the characteristic features of the geodesic motion in this metric , and eventually calculate numerically , in the last section , the actual effective motion ( meaning as seen by a geodesic observer ) of a point source initially aligned with a string and an observer when a pulse of lightlike current passes between the source and the observer .",
    "we conclude by considering the astrophysical observational possibilities and discussing a possible mechanism for generating pulses of lightlike current in cosmic strings .",
    "in this section , we shall obtain the gravitational field surrounding a cosmic string carrying a lightlike current , treating the source as an infinitely thin distribution .",
    "one easy way to do so is by the limiting procedure  @xcite of boosting the metric of the spacelike current case    which is known  @xcite    to the speed of light in the direction parallel to the string ( alternatively , one could also boost the timelike current metric , both procedures being equivalent ) .    in the case of spacelike current , for a static cylindrically symmetric configuration with the string lying along the @xmath3axis ,",
    "the metric outside the core of the string is  @xcite @xmath4 here , @xmath5 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the thickness of the core of the string . the nonvanishing component of the electromagnetic field is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is newton s constant .",
    "the various parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 should be determined , in principle , in terms of the microphysical parameters characterizing the vortex by matching the exterior metric  ( [ metricini ] ) with the solution of einstein s equations inside the core of the string ( i.e. , for @xmath14 ) . in practice",

    "in the previous section , we treated the superconducting string as an infinitely thin distribution along which a pulse of lightlike current flows . the question remains , however , of whether it is possible to find the corresponding solutions in the underlying field theoretic model coupled to gravity .",

    ", we can say that the lightlike current actually decouples from the background fields forming the static string , since the introduction of the null gauge field has no effect on @xmath97 , @xmath96 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",

    ", however , that the stationary metric has peculiar asymptotic properties .",
    "in particular , since the potential grows logarithmically with radius , the motion in the @xmath160 direction will be bounded even for light rays ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "therefore , the problem of asymptotic light deflection is not well posed because we do not have asymptotic regions where light rays would propagate along straight lines .",
    "of course , this extreme behaviour will not arise if , instead of the stationary metric , we consider a finite pulse of current , because then the metric is flat before and after the passage of the wave . for simplicity",
    ", we can take a pulse with a step function profile .",

    "on the other hand , a light ray in the @xmath185 plane will be deflected in the @xmath22 direction by the wave , but the sign of the deflection depends on whether the interaction with the wave happens when the ray is approaching the string or when the ray has already surpassed the string and is moving away from it . in the former case , the deflection is in the positive @xmath22 direction , whereas in the latter it is in the negative @xmath22 direction .    in the next section , we shall numerically treat the motion of null geodesics in the spacetime given by  ( [ 32 ] ) , but for the rest of this section , we shall concentrate on a special case which can be treated analytically , namely the shock wave case  @xcite @xmath186 this can be considered as limiting case of  ( [ 32 ] ) when the thickness of the wave is much smaller than other relevant dimensions in the problem ( such as the impact parameter or the distance of the wave and of the observer to the string )",

    "an interesting question , from the observational point of view , is to find out what is the effect of the wave on the double image caused by the static string .",

    "then it splits into two images which describe semicircles of radius @xmath226 .",
    "finally , the two images merge at the bottom of the circle and eventually go back to the original position .",
    "however , for all its beauty , this pattern will not arise in situations involving realistic cosmic strings . typically , the effect of the deficit angle is always comparable , if not much larger , than the effect due to the current .",
    "the reason is that , although a cosmic string can in principle support an arbitrarily large lightlike current , it is difficult to think of a mechanism to generate currents much stronger than the `` critical current '' , defined by the condition @xmath227 .",

    "dropping the tildes , we now have the following equation to solve numerically : @xmath249 where @xmath250 while eqs .  ( [ ddotr ] ) and  ( [ ddotth ] ) still hold .    that the approximation of neglecting radial motion is valid can be checked by considering the actual radial displacement experienced by the observer . according to eq .",
    "( [ ddotr ] ) with the previous choice @xmath243 , and assuming the observer to be initially at rest , one has @xmath251 where we neglected variations of @xmath42 with @xmath123 , since this effect is of higher order .",
    "thus , at most , the correction in @xmath160 reads @xmath252 with @xmath253 as discussed earlier .",
    "therefore , since in practical application , one expects @xmath254 , the motion in the radial direction can be confidently neglected .",
    "we have investigated numerically the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ ddotr ] ) , ( [ ddotth ] ) and  ( [ newtz ] ) for various values of the parameters describing the pulse , and the results are displayed on figs .",

    "we have assumed a gut string of core radius @xmath255mpc , and the internal string parameters have been enhanced to @xmath256 and @xmath257 in order to magnify the corresponding lensing effect .",
    "the string is located at @xmath258mpc from the observer and @xmath259mpc from the source ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : not ] ) , and the duration of the pulse is @xmath260mpc .",
    "this particular example provides an illustration of a generic situation .",
    "we are mainly interested by what the observer actually sees , that is , with the notation of fig .",
    "[ fig : not ] , we want to know the variations of the angles @xmath233 and @xmath234 with time , i.e. , we calculate the values of @xmath261 and @xmath262 as a function of the time of arrival of each light ray .",
    "the predicted observations are the following .",
    "initially , the observer sees the usual double image ( the two parallel straight lines on fig .",
    "[ fig : tht ] ) until the wave reaches the first deflected ray .",
    "then , the two images appear to move away from each other , while in the same time moving upwards ( fig .  [",
    "fig : pht ] ) . after a time characteristic of the pulse duration ( or of the impact parameter",
    "if this is larger than the pulse duration ) , the images begin to go down and eventually towards each other , and finally they reach a new position in the sky as the wave has passed . put together , figs .",
    "[ fig : pht ] and  [ fig : tht ] yield fig .",
    "[ fig : phitheff ] which shows the actual apparent trajectory of the source .",
    "the source is seen to follow two open symmetric curves , i.e. , the final location of the source in the sky is not the same as the initial one .",
    "this can be understood as follow : as the wave passes through the observer and the source , they both reach new positions in space , but because they were not initially at the same distance to the string ( only case for which we expect closed curves at this level of approximation ) , they have not travelled the same distances in the @xmath22 direction , the variation in @xmath22 being @xmath263 as discussed earlier . assuming the source to be farther than the observer implies that the latter has travelled more than the former which is thus seen below its initial location .",
    "more precisely , the actual angle of observation will be @xmath264 , with @xmath230 as defined previously on eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "in addition to this effect there is a frame rotation effect : since the observer moves in both radial and @xmath22 directions , its frame is being rotated ( parallel transported ) , so that he will see the source at an angle @xmath265 because of this rotation . in practice , @xmath266 will be negligible due to the large denominators , and the curves will be almost closed .    another possible way to measure the effect of",
    "the wave is through the redshift of the source : since each light ray experiences a different gravitational potential , one would expect to observe the source with a frequency that should vary while the wave passes . for",
    "the purpose of calculating this effect , let us define the redshift @xmath267 by the relation @xmath268 here @xmath269 is the four - velocity of the observer or of the source , whereas @xmath270 is the four - momentum of the light ray .",
    "we have @xmath271 .",
    "[ fig : red ] shows this redshift as a function of the time of arrival of the light rays with , for comparison , the corresponding angles @xmath233 and @xmath272 , and assuming the same parameters ( @xmath273 , @xmath216 , @xmath98 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath7 ) as on previous figures .",
    "the redshift ( solid line ) is seen to be strongly correlated with the deflection in the @xmath234 direction .",
    "it should be clear that simultaneous measurements of effective motion of double images ( figs .",
    "[ fig : pht ] to  [ fig : phitheff ] ) together with the reshift variability shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : red ] would provide an unambiguous signature of the existence of cosmic strings endowed with superconducting currents .",
    "the characteristic time scale during which the source is actually moving in the sky can be evaluated as roughly the wave duration if this one is large enough ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : a ] ) .",
    "however , one may expect astrophysical situations in which @xmath98 is much smaller than any other length involved in the problem .",
    "in particular , for the idealized shock wave case of eq .",
    "( [ 34 ] ) , the observation time should be of the order of the impact parameter @xmath274 . in practice ,",
    "the actual time during which the motion of the source takes place is thus @xmath275,\\ ] ] which , in the case of a gut string located at a few mpc from us , would be of a few years .",
    "this can be seen more precisely on fig .",
    "[ fig : a].@xmath99 where the time variability of the angle @xmath234 is shown for various values of the wave duration @xmath98 : on these curves , it is clear that the characteristic time in which the signal reaches its maximum is essentially independent of @xmath98 , and in fact reflects only the distance of the string to the observer .    finally , let us ask the question of the dependence of these results with the various geometric parameters @xmath273 , @xmath216 and @xmath98 .",
    "as long as @xmath276 , the results do not depend strongly on @xmath273 and we can take @xmath277 as we did in the previous section . for fixed @xmath273 and @xmath98 , the effect decreases with increasing @xmath216 . also displayed on fig .",
    "[ fig : phitheff ] is the previously discussed result for @xmath278 and 100  mpc , with a fixed value @xmath260  mpc of the wave duration .",
    "the effect decreases with increasing @xmath216 , although only by a factor of order 1 .",
    "since we are in the case in which the duration of the wave is much longer than the impact parameter @xmath279 , the angular deflection is of order @xmath230 in the @xmath233 direction and of order @xmath280 in the @xmath234 direction , as discussed at the end of the last section .",
    "if the source is much closer to the string than the observer is , i.e. , in the limit @xmath281 the angular deflection would be suppressed by a geometrical factor of order @xmath282 .",
    "we have derived an exact solution of the einstein s equations that describes the gravitational field surrounding a lightlike current carrying cosmic string .",
    "the current can be of arbitrary shape and time dependence . in the thin string limit",
    ", the exterior metric belongs to the general class of @xmath0-wave solutions .",
    "this exterior metric can be matched with the solution of the witten model coupled to gravity in the core of the string .",
    "the resulting metric is just a taub - kerr - shild generalization of the metric of a cosmic string with vanishing current .",
    "an interesting feature of the solution is that both the function @xmath283 characterizing the electromagnetic field and the function @xmath284 describing the gravitational disturbance obey linear equations [ see eqs .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ 27 ] ) ] .",
    "this fact can be understood heuristically as a consequence of the lorentz invariance of the `` seed '' solution and the lightlike nature of the perturbation . indeed , as mentioned before , under a lorentz transformation of velocity @xmath285 parallel to the string we have @xmath286 and @xmath287 , where @xmath288 .",
    "physically , this reflects the fact that the source is redshifted for @xmath289 .",
    "therefore , by making @xmath285 sufficiently close to 1 , we can make @xmath143 and @xmath290 as small as we wish .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that these quantities should obey linear equations .",
    "this also explains why the profile of the vortex and the metric functions @xmath87 and @xmath88 of section  [ wit ] are unchanged by introducing the lightlike current .",
    "we calculated the motion of light rays for the case of a pulse current of finite duration @xmath98 and constant amplitude characterized by the parameter @xmath230 given in eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "in addition , we have the parameter @xmath291 characterizing the mass scale of the cosmic string ( typically we have @xmath292 for gut strings ) , and the geometric parameters @xmath273 and @xmath216 , which give the distance from the string to the source and the observer respectively .",
    "we restricted attention to the case when source and observer are colineal with the string and are initially in a plane orthogonal to the string axis , obtaining the following results .",
    "the initial image is the usual double image before the lightlike current passes , and each one of the double images describes an ( almost ) closed loop in the sky as the wave passes . for @xmath276 , the angular size of the loop is of order @xmath230 in the direction perpendicular to the string and of order @xmath293 in the direction parallel to the string . here",
    "@xmath279 is the typical impact parameter and we are assuming @xmath294 .",
    "we have also seen that the images experience a blueshift and a redshift which is strongly correlated with the apparent motion in the direction parallel to the string , and which is also of order @xmath293 . for sources very close to the string , such that @xmath295 , the magnitude of the angular deflection is decreased by a geometrical factor roughly of order @xmath282 , although for obvious reasons , the redshift effect is unaffected by this factor .",
    "these results only apply if the duration of the pulse is large compared with the impact parameter , that is , if @xmath296  max  @xmath297 $ ] . in the opposite limit , the pulse can be approximated by a delta function shock wave . sending the source to infinite distance",
    ", the apparent motion of the double images can be calculated analytically . when the effect of the deficit angle is dominant with respect to the effect of the passing wave ( more precisely , when @xmath298 ) , the double images describe circular motion in the sky , of angular radius given by @xmath299 .",
    "the time scale needed for the image to go around the curve reflects the impact parameter as well as the duration of the pulse .",
    "the effect grows to an angular size of order @xmath230 in a characteristic time of order @xmath300 . if @xmath301 the effect persist for a time of order @xmath98 , and then decreases again in a time scale of order @xmath300 .",
    "for instance , a gut string endowed with a short pulse of gut lightlike current located at a few mpc from us , would deflect an infinitely far source in a few years time , and along a curve of angular aperture of the order @xmath1rad , a phenomenon which should be within the reach of observational detection limits .",
    "in fact , an observation of this kind requires quite particular conditions due to the scarcity in the number of strings that we expect out to such distances  @xcite . nonetheless , we believe that the low observational probability is largely compensated by the uniqueness of the signal : such an observation would provide a clear proof of the existence of cosmic strings , and show that they are of the superconducting current - carrying kind .",
    "let us estimate this observation probability more precisely by proposing a mechanism through which lightlike currents can build in cosmic string , namely the interaction of such a string with a galaxy , or any region having an electromagnetic field .",
    "in the original witten model  @xcite , the currents built in such a way are small compared with the gut scale . however , in models with spontaneous current generation  @xcite one may be able to build up saturation currents in such a way .",
    "if this interaction region is finite , and if the string can be approximated as straight across it , then a current will be induced  @xcite , which can be represented by means of a phase function @xmath302 along the string as @xmath303 .",
    "now , away from the interaction region , where the external electromagnetic field vanishes , the general solution for @xmath302 ( to first order in @xmath49 ) is  @xcite @xmath304 and must be constant if no interaction takes place .",
    "so , far from the interaction region , one has two waves of null current , one travelling in the positive @xmath22 direction and the other in the negative @xmath22 direction , both at the speed of light , and with a duration of the order of the size of the interaction region . as mentioned before",
    ", the null current does not affect the profile of the string , and so there is in principle no limit to the amount of lightlike current that a string can carry .",
    "however , since in the interaction region the current will be typically spacelike or timelike , and such currents achieve saturation , it is clear that we can not build up lightlike currents whose strength @xmath230 is much larger than @xmath291 .",
    "we see therefore that a requirement for observing a string s lightlike current pulse is that there exist string loops crossing galaxies say , and whose size would exceed that of the interaction region .",
    "now we know that the string loop distribution is such that  @xcite @xmath305 for the number @xmath306 of loops of size @xmath307 located in a sphere of radius @xmath216 . here , @xmath308 is the age of universe ( 10@xmath309 yr ) and @xmath310 is a parameter obtained by numerical simulations .",
    "the coherence length of a string due to wiggles is @xmath311 , where @xmath312  @xcite and so we want @xmath307 to be at least this value .",
    "moreover , the impact parameter @xmath279 being the typical duration of the effective motion of the source , we require it to be @xmath313  yr so as to be able to actually measure the effect .",
    "this means that we require @xmath314  yr  @xmath315 .",
    "thus , the expected number of events can be estimated as @xmath316 which can be quite small for gut strings , but otherwise increases tremendously for lower mass strings , and is of order one for @xmath317 .",
    "this shows that lighter strings would perhaps produce a detectable ( at the level of arc seconds ) double image moving according to our calculations with a correspondingly varying redshift .",
    "it should be mentioned that this work has been involved with a lightlike current wave separating two regions of the string where there was no current .",
    "lightlike currents may also exist at the boundary between spacelike and timelike currents .",
    "the time evolution of such lightlike currents and their gravitational effect is left for further research .",
    "we should also say that for cosmic strings without currents , time dependent exact solutions have been studied in the past , e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the positions of the double images are also time dependent , although the actual apparent motion is qualitatively different from our case .",
    "finally , one may consider solutions describing the collision of two pulses of lightlike current travelling in opposite directions . before the collision the metric is a trivial superposition of two solutions like the one we have considered in this paper , but during and after the collision the solution will contain interesting non - linear effects . in particular",
    ", since the metric in the impulsive case resembles very much the aichelburg - sexl metric @xcite ( representing the gravitational field of an ultrarelativistic body ) , and it is known that the head on collision of two such shock waves generates trapped surfaces @xcite , it would be interesting to study the possibility that the collision of such lightlike currents would produce black holes .",
