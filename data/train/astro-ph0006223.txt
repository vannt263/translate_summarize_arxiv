    "structure formation of the universe from the large scale structure to the stellar objects is one of the most important issues of modern cosmology and astrophysics . within a framework of the hierarchical clustering scenario which is suggested by the adiabatic cold dark matter ( cdm ) models , formation of first luminous objects in the universe",
    "has been discussed by many authors ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; haiman & loeb 1997 ; nishi , et  al 1998 ) . according to those theoretical investigations , in which the initial dark matter and baryon density fluctuations have been solved linearly , the first luminous objects are thought to appear in the gas clouds in the dark halo at @xmath6 , depending on the cosmological models .    on the other hand a new mechanism which causes rapid growth of the baryon density fluctuations on",
    "very small scales during a short period of the recombination epoch has been proposed by shaviv ( 1998 ) .",
    "this growth of the baryon density perturbations is caused by the radiation drag force from the large scale velocity field which is coupled to the small scale baryon perturbations in a nonlinear manner .",
    "he has pointed out enormous growth ( @xmath7 ) of baryon fluctuations if the wavelength of the perturbations is shorter than a critical value .",
    "such enormous amplification of baryon density fluctuations must lead to early formation of stellar objects .",
    "if the amplification is as large as shaviv s prediction , therefore , it might be a quite interesting antithesis for the standard scenario of the cosmic structure formation in the cdm cosmological models , though we will show that this nonlinear growth mechanism would not be so drastic .    in this paper , we first",
    "carefully re - examine shaviv s treatment of density perturbations .",
    "we find the diffusion term which shaviv has neglected in his analysis plays a crucial role for suppression of the nonlinear growth .",
    "there are also some artificial assumptions in shaviv s investigation .",
    "first one is in use of the thermal equilibrium for the recombination process .",
    "this nonlinear growth is induced by the shear velocity field on larger scales through the radiation drag force against density fluctuations of ionized hydrogens .",
    "therefore we need to calculate fluctuations of the ionization fraction .",
    "shaviv has obtained these fluctuations by employing the perturbed saha equation which should not be applied during the recombination epoch . here",
    "we develop a new method to treat these fluctuations by the perturbed treatment of the rate equation which is an extension of the previous work by yamamoto , sugiyama , and sato ( 1997 , paper i ) .",
    "the next assumption shaviv has made in his investigation is the existence of isothermal baryon density fluctuations .",
    "it is well known that the adiabatic baryon and photon density perturbations are erased away due to the photon diffusion before and during the recombination epoch ( silk 1968 ;  sato 1971 ;  weinberg 1971 ) . the diffusion ( silk )",
    "damping scale goes over the galaxy scale .",
    "therefore it seems to be unavoidable for the nonlinear growth mechanism to assume small scale isothermal baryon perturbations during the recombination epoch as the seeds of baryon perturbations in an artificial manner .",
    "the origin of the small scale isothermal baryon perturbations has not been considered .",
    "however we would like to stress that the small scale isothermal baryon density fluctuations are produced after the silk damping in general cdm cosmological models without any ad hoc assumptions .",
    "such isothermal baryon density fluctuations on small scales have been found by yamamoto , sugiyama & sato ( 1998 , paper ii ) .",
    "once baryon fluctuations are damped by diffusion .",
    "however they grow again owing to the gravitational potential of cdm before the recombination epoch due to the breakdown of the tight - coupling between baryons and background photons . since the compton drag from background photons is still effective at that epoch and works as friction , this growth of baryon density fluctuations is characterized by the terminal velocity .",
    "such natural existence of the small scale isothermal baryon density fluctuations motivates us to revisit shaviv s investigation in the context of the conventional adiabatic cdm models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  2 , we review the nonlinear growth mechanism which shaviv has proposed . some numerical tests for a toy model with simple assumptions are presented in  3 .",
    "it is shown that the diffusion term plays a crucial role for the estimate of the growth factor . in  4 , we examine whether the nonlinear growth mechanism is effective on the adiabatic cdm models or not .",
    " 5 is devoted to summary . throughout this paper",
    "we work in units where @xmath8 , and assume @xmath9 as the cosmic microwave radiation temperature at present .",
    "before describing the nonlinear growth mechanism of small scale baryon density fluctuations proposed by shaviv ( 1998 ) , let us first summarize basic equations ( see also paper i ; ii ) .",
    "we work in the newtonian perturbed metric , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the perturbed gravitational potential , @xmath12 is the scale factor whose suffix @xmath13 indicates the present value , and @xmath14 . as we are interested in the small scale cosmological perturbations , we can assume the geometry of the universe to be flat",
    ". then , in the high redshift universe , the friedmann equation leads to @xmath15 where the dot denotes @xmath16-differentiation , @xmath17 is the hubble constant , and @xmath18 is the scale factor at the matter - radiation equality epoch which can be written as @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the neutrino fraction in the energy density of radiation components . for the massless standard neutrino model with three species , @xmath21 , which we adopt throughout the present paper . here ,",
    "we take into account the fraction of helium abundance .",
    "hence we define the fractional ionization @xmath22 as @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are the number densities of free electron , helium , and hydrogen , respectively .",
    "the primordial helium mass fraction is defined as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the net baryon number density .",
    "we set @xmath29 throughout the present paper .",
    "the fractional ionization @xmath22 is @xmath30 in the very early universe and becomes @xmath31 just before the recombination epoch due to the early recombination of helium atoms .",
    "let us now describe the nonlinear growth mechanism .",
    "we proceed with reviewing equations of the small perturbations for the baryon - electron fluid .",
    "since we are interested in the evolution of density perturbations on very small scales , we adopt the newtonian approximation .",
    "the evolution equations for the baryon - electron fluid coupled with the primeval radiation through compton scattering are written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the density and the velocity of the baryon - electron fluid , respectively , @xmath35 is the pressure , @xmath36 is the thomson cross section , @xmath37 is the dipole moment of the photon field , and @xmath38 is defined as @xmath39 with the spatially averaged energy density of the photon field @xmath40 , where @xmath41 denotes the background quantity . the right hand side of equation ( [ vbeq ] ) represents the radiation drag force caused through the compton interaction between electrons and photons which can be written by using @xmath42 that is the time scale of momentum transfer between the baryon - electron fluid and the photon fluid as @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the proton mass .",
    "as the universe expands , the momentum transfer time scale @xmath42 becomes longer .",
    "however the drag time scale is still small enough to keep the tight coupling between baryon - electron and photon fluids even just before the recombination epoch , so that @xmath45",
    ". eventually the tight coupling breaks down as the recombination process proceeds when the photon mean free path becomes larger than the wavelength of the density perturbations ( see also paper ii ) .",
    "let us now focus on perturbations of the baryon - electron fluid on very small scales .",
    "as far as considering linear density perturbations , perturbations of each scale evolve individually . following shaviv ( 1998 ) , however , we take into account the quasi - nonlinear contribution of the drag force from the large scale velocity field . to be specific , we separate the velocity field into the small scale part which we focus on and the large scale part which describes the nonlinear contribution to the small scale perturbations as , @xmath46 where indices @xmath47 and @xmath48 indicate small and large scales , respectively . the fluctuation of the fractional ionization on the small scale is defined as @xmath49 .",
    "then the right hand side of equation ( [ vbeq ] ) leads to @xmath50 where @xmath51 here we ignore higher order terms of the small scale perturbations .",
    "the term @xmath52 in equation ( [ rhs ] ) describes the quasi - nonlinear coupling between the large scale shear velocity and the small scale baryon density fluctuations . adding this quasi - nonlinear term , we can write the linear perturbation equations on the small scale as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the sound velocity of the baryon - electron fluid defined by @xmath55 . in deriving equation ( [ shavivvb ] ) ,",
    "we have assumed the isothermal perturbations for the small scale perturbations , i.e. , @xmath56 since the silk damping process erases the density perturbation and the dipole moment of the photon field on small scales .",
    "let us investigate the effect of the quasi - nonlinear term @xmath57 on the evolution of perturbations . before the recombination epoch ,",
    "@xmath58 due to the tight coupling . however , the tight coupling becomes broken down , i.e. , @xmath59 , as the decoupling process proceeds and the contribution from the quasi - nonlinear term may not be negligible anymore .",
    "in fact shaviv has claimed that this quasi - nonlinear contribution , which represents the spatially fluctuating radiation drag force , causes enormous amplification of baryon density fluctuations during the recombination epoch .",
    "hereafter , we omit the label (s) , for simplicity . combining equations ( [ conte ] ) and ( [ shavivvb ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the laplacian .    by assuming the wave form solution , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the comoving wave number",
    ", we have the dispersion relation @xmath64 where @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 being the shear velocity from the large scale . here",
    "@xmath68 , @xmath42 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 are time scales for the hubble expansion , the radiation drag , the sound oscillation , the jeans oscillation , and the quasi - nonlinear radiation force , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath72 of equation ( [ taur ] ) is defined as @xmath73 a nonzero value of @xmath72 provides the quasi - nonlinear effect .",
    "shaviv obtained @xmath72 by employing the saha equation .",
    "the validity of this assumption will discuss in  4 .",
    "the derivation of @xmath74 is shown in appendix b. in the above expressions , the baryon mass @xmath75 is used instead of the comoving wave number @xmath76 ( paper i ) , which is defined by @xmath77 it should be noticed that we take into account only the baryon component for the gravitational potential .",

    "before carrying out fully consistent calculations based on density perturbations of actual cosmological models , we investigate the nonlinear growth for a toy model .",
    "first , we assume the large scale velocity @xmath85 is constant in time throughout this section .",
    "secondly , as shaviv has done in his paper , the fractional ionization @xmath86 and its perturbation @xmath74 are calculated by employing the saha equation , which is described in appendix b. we take the fiducial cdm model , i.e. , @xmath87 and @xmath88 . the time evolution of the fractional ionization is shown in fig .  1",
    ".    we also plot the redshift visibility function @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the optical depth .",
    "the width of the visibility function corresponds to the recombination epoch .",
    "therefore the recombination epoch of this model is @xmath91 .",
    "let us first compare time scales of equations ( [ tauh])([taur ] ) . in fig .  2 ,",
    "these ( inverse ) time scales are plotted as a function of @xmath92 .",
    "the panel ( a ) shows @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , all which do not depend on @xmath76 .",
    "note that @xmath93 dominates others before and during the recombination epoch .",
    "however as the recombination process proceeds , this time scale suddenly increases and eventually exceeds other time scales after recombination . in this panel , we plot @xmath96 which is also independent on @xmath76 .",
    "we will discuss this variable later in this section .    in the panel ( b ) ,",
    "we plot @xmath97 and @xmath98 for different wave numbers @xmath76 , i.e. , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 which correspond to mass scales @xmath103 , and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "now let us discuss the growth rate @xmath80 $ ] by comparing the time scales in the expression ( [ solomega ] ) . as is shown in fig .  2 , the larger the wave number @xmath76 , the larger the inverse time scales @xmath98 and @xmath97 become .",
    "therefore we expect to obtain the maximum growth rate when we take the small scale limit , i.e. , @xmath105 .",
    "as is shown in appendix a , the real part of the square root term of equation ( [ solomega ] ) approaches to @xmath106 which is the combination seen in the panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "shaviv claimed that this combination provides the maximum growth rate , i.e. , @xmath107_{\\rm max}^{\\rm shav } = { \\tau_{\\rm o}\\over 2 \\tau_{\\rm r}^2 } = { \\alpha \\delta v_0 \\over 2 c_s \\tau_{\\rm d } } ~ .",
    "\\label{max_s}\\ ] ]    however , this is not the whole story .",
    "the complete expression of equation ( [ solomega ] ) with large @xmath76 limit becomes @xmath107_{\\rm max}\\equiv \\lim_{k\\rightarrow \\infty}~ \\re[\\omega ] = -\\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\rm d } } + { \\tau_{\\rm o}\\over 2\\tau_{\\rm r}^2 }    = -\\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\rm d } } + { \\alpha \\delta v_0 \\over 2 c_s \\tau_{\\rm d } } ~ .",
    "\\label{max}\\ ] ] here we ignore the inverse hubble time scale because it is much smaller than @xmath93 during recombination .",
    "remember that @xmath93 is comparable to @xmath108 during recombination as is shown in fig .",
    "in fact , the existence of this @xmath93 term suppresses the nonlinear growth a lot . from equation ( [ max ] ) , it is found that a sufficient condition for the nonlinear growth at least on the smallest scale is @xmath80_{\\rm max}>0 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath109    in fig .  3 ,",
    "the growth rates and the growth factors of the toy model are plotted for various wave numbers and the large wave number limit .    from this figure , it is found that the growth rate and the growth factor are very sensitive to the value of the large scale velocity field @xmath85 .",
    "the growth factor of @xmath110 is more than factor @xmath111 larger than the one of @xmath112 for the large @xmath76 limit .",
    "the `` maximum '' growth rates and growth factors obtained by shaviv s formula ( eq .  [ [ max_s ] ] ) are also plotted for comparison in fig .",
    "it is clear that neglect of the diffusion results in the extremely large false growth factor . by the correct treatment , rather mild growth",
    "when we take relatively large velocity @xmath110 , we obtain about factor @xmath113 growth factor while shaviv s treatment induces more than @xmath114 growth of small scale density perturbations . from fig .",
    "3 , it is shown that the nonlinear growth mechanism starts to work in the relatively early epoch ( @xmath115 ) if we neglect the diffusion term .",
    "however , by the correct treatment , it is found that the nonlinear growth works only when @xmath116 , i.e. , @xmath117 in this fiducial cdm model as is shown in fig .",
    "2 . even in this shorter period ,",
    "the maximum growth rate is suppressed by the existence of the diffusion term ( eq .  [ [ max ] ] ) .",
    "we should conclude that the enormous growth @xmath7 of the baryon density fluctuations which shaviv claimed in his paper is not likely to happen .",
    "however , we should emphasize that this nonlinear growth mechanism still works and enhances the baryon density perturbations .",
    "it is interesting to estimate the nonlinear growth factor for realistic cosmological models .",
    "since it is generally believed that adiabatic small scale baryon density perturbations decay out before and during the recombination epoch due to the diffusion ( silk ) damping , an additional assumption to standard adiabatic perturbations seems to be needed for the nonlinear growth mechanism which requires the existence of small scale baryon perturbations . in the paper by shaviv ( 1998 ) , for example , he artificially assumed the existence of baryon isothermal density perturbations .",
    "however , we should point out that small scale _ isothermal _ baryon density perturbations are in fact existing at the recombination epoch in _ general adiabatic _ cdm models .",
    "recently , the authors of the present paper ( k.y . &",
    "n.s . ) and",
    "sato have found that small scale baryon perturbations grow after the diffusion ( silk ) damping even before the recombination epoch ( paper ii ) .",
    "this growth of baryon density perturbations before the recombination epoch is the result of the breaking of the tight - coupling between the baryon perturbations and the photon perturbations on small scales .",
    "the growth is characterized by the terminal velocity , which implies the balance between the gravitational force due to the potential of cdm and the friction force by the compton interaction with background photons . according to the previous investigation in paper ii , the fourier coefficient of the small scale baryon perturbations grows in proportion to @xmath118 .",
    "the small scale baryon density perturbations have amplitude of order @xmath119 compared with the cdm perturbations .",
    "the small scale photon perturbations are smeared out by the diffusion damping . on the other hand , the energy transfer between the baryon - electron fluid and the background photons is effective during and for some time after the recombination epoch",
    ". therefore the nature of the small scale baryon perturbations is isothermal during these epochs ( see paper i ) .",
    "these isothermal baryon perturbations could be enhanced by the nonlinear growth mechanism although the growth factor may not be as large as originally thought by shaviv as is described in the previous section .",
    "the amplitude of the large scale velocity field @xmath85 is crucial for the instability as is shown in fig .",
    "3 . in linear theory of density perturbations ,",
    "the variance of square of the large scale velocity field is evaluated by @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 are fourier coefficients of the dipole anisotropy of the photon field and the peculiar velocity field of the baryon fluid , respectively . introducing the parameter @xmath123",
    ", we derive the large scale velocity field from the rms one as @xmath124    we consistently solve the linear perturbations of the photon , baryon , and dark matter system in the expanding universe to calculate the rms velocity on large scales . in fig .  4 ,",
    "the rms velocities of various cobe normalized cdm models are shown .",
    "it is found that the rms velocities are typically @xmath125 just before recombination .",
    "they rapidly increase toward @xmath126 as the recombination process proceeds when the tight coupling between photons and baryons breaks .",
    "we may conclude that effective values of the rms velocities during the recombination epoch are about a few times @xmath127 regardless of model parameters . according to our toy model calculations as is shown in fig .  3 , therefore",
    ", we expect only high velocity peaks induce the nonlinear growth on small scales in the realistic cosmological models .    to calculate the growth rate and the growth factor of baryon density fluctuations , we need to obtain perturbations of the fractional ionization @xmath74 .",
    "once we can get @xmath74 , we calculate @xmath72 , which is defined by equation ( [ alpha ] ) to estimate @xmath71 . using baryon density fluctuations @xmath128 of the previous time step",
    ", we can calculate @xmath71 , the growth rate and the growth factor .",
    "we can estimate @xmath128 with multiplying this growth factor by the amplitude of linear density perturbations with the cobe normalization .    strictly speaking",
    ", we may have to solve radiative transfer during the recombination epoch to get precise value of fluctuations of @xmath74 .",
    "instead , we have employed two approximation methods here .",
    "first method is to employ saha s formula as shaviv has done in his paper , which is a very simple but unrealistic assumption during and after the recombination epoch .",
    "it is well known that even the fractional ionization itself leaves from the value by saha s formula as recombination proceeds ( see e.g. , jones & wise 1985 ) .",
    "therefore we next develop a perturbed treatment of the rate equation .",
    "detailed treatments of these two methods are described in appendix b. it is shown there that these two methods provide very different @xmath86 and @xmath74 .",
    "it is found that the nonlinear growth mechanism does not work at all for the fiducial cdm model with @xmath129 , and @xmath88 if we employ the saha equation for the evolution of @xmath86 and @xmath74 .",
    "it is because @xmath85 is too small during the recombination epoch , i.e. , @xmath130 and @xmath131 . in this calculation , @xmath132 for all time , which leads to the real part of @xmath79 of equation ( [ solomega ] ) to be negative on small scales .    if we employ the perturbed rate equation to calculate @xmath74 , however , the nonlinear growth mechanism is effective since the recombination process continues until much later epoch , @xmath133 as is shown in fig .  7 in appendix",
    "b , when @xmath85 is large enough to induce the nonlinear growth by the drag force .",
    "we obtain the nonlinear growth factor as a function of redshift @xmath134 in fig .",
    "5 for various cobe normalized cdm models , i.e. , the fiducial model with @xmath135 and @xmath88 and low density flat and open models with @xmath136 and @xmath137 . for the purpose of comparison , different values of baryon density ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath138 and @xmath139 are considered .",
    "we adopt @xmath4 peaks for the amplitude of the large scale velocity field .",
    "the nonlinear growth mechanism works from @xmath140 to @xmath141 which depends on the value of @xmath142 .",
    "plots the final growth factors as a function of wave number @xmath76 .",
    "we find that the growth factors of low density cdm models are less than the ones of @xmath135 models .",
    "it is mostly because the cobe normalized rms velocity fields of low density models are smaller when the mechanism effectively works ( @xmath143 ) as is shown in fig .",
    "the strong @xmath144 dependence of the growth factor is also found in fig .",
    "the reason is following .",
    "the residual ionization at low redshifts scales as @xmath145 ( see e.g. , peebles 1993 ) .",
    "therefore we have smaller @xmath86 for larger @xmath144 .",
    "the maximum growth rate can be written as ( eq .  [ [ max ] ] ) , @xmath80_{\\rm max}=\\left ( { \\alpha \\delta v_0 / 2 c_s } -1 \\right ) /\\left(2 \\tau_{\\rm d}\\right ) .",
    "$ ]    as is shown in fig .  8 in appendix b , the @xmath144 dependence of @xmath72 is relatively weak because of cancellation in between @xmath86 and @xmath74 .",
    "the remaining dependence appears through @xmath146 . for larger @xmath144 , therefore , @xmath86 and the maximum growth factor become smaller .",
    "we investigate the evolution of the baryon density perturbations on very small scales , especially focus on the nonlinear growth induced by the shear velocity field on large scales , which is originally proposed by shaviv ( 1998 ) .",
    "first we study this nonlinear evolution with employing simple assumptions , i.e. , the constant large scale shear velocity field and the saha equation for the calculations of the fractional ionization and its fluctuation .",
    "what we find is not enormous amplification of density fluctuations but relatively mild growth .",
    "the reason of shaviv s overestimation is because he has neglected the diffusion term which suppresses the growth .    it is found that the growth factor is very sensitive to the value of the large scale shear velocity field .",
    "only small difference ( @xmath110 versus @xmath147 ) causes huge divergence of the final growth factor ( factor @xmath113 versus @xmath148 ) .    following the previous works ( paper i & ii )",
    ", we next apply the nonlinear growth mechanism to density perturbations of general adiabatic cdm models . in these works",
    ", it has been found that the baryon density perturbations are not completely erased by diffusion damping if there exists gravitational potential of cdm .",
    "they even grow before recombination under the balance between the radiative drag force and the gravitational force .",
    "we investigate the nonlinear growth of these baryon density fluctuations with employing the perturbed rate equation which is proposed first time in this paper .",
    "the results are followings : ( 1 ) the nonlinear growth is larger in smaller scales .",
    "this mechanism only affects the perturbations whose scales are smaller than @xmath149 .",
    "( 2 ) the maximum growth factors of baryon density fluctuations by this mechanism for various cobe normalized cdm models are typically less than factor @xmath3 even if we take @xmath4 large scale velocity peaks .",
    "( 3 ) the strong @xmath144 dependence of the growth factor is found .",
    "this is because of the @xmath144 dependence of the residual ionization .",
    "the fractional ionization @xmath86 , which is proportional to the inverse diffusion time scale and the maximum growth rate , is larger for smaller @xmath144 .",
    "how could this nonlinear growth mechanism affect on the structure formation in the high redshift universe ?",
    "it is very interesting coincidence that the typical scale of the nonlinear growth is about the stellar size ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "however we need to carry out high resolution numerical simulations to investigate the evolution of the stellar scale density fluctuations on which a lot of other complicated physical processes , i.e. , shock heating , uv radiation from first starts or agn , cooling and so on , work .",
    "our quasi - linear perturbation analysis provides the initial condition for the calculations of such complicated structure formation in the high - z universe .",
    "the transfer function of the baryon density perturbations can be obtained by multiplying the nonlinear growth factor by the transfer function of the linear perturbations which is derived in paper ii .",
