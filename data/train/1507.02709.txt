    "generally , chern - simons terms will appear in the context of finite temperature four - dimensional gauge theories such as the standard electroweak theory @xcite .",

    "therefore , an ensemble of vortices and antivortices will be confined to minimize the energy of the system .",
    "this is the dynamical realization of the classical confinement that was pointed out by cornalba and wilczek @xcite and de wild propitius @xcite . since our vortices carry magnetic fluxes , they will also exhibit non - trivial statistics in the infrared .",
    "thus , a collection of these vortices will behave like anyons with long - range fields .",

    "it is crucial that the model we consider does not have a self chern - simons term , @xmath19 , for the @xmath17 gauge field which would otherwise spoil its long - range behavior .",
    "then , one wonders if quantum corrections can generate such a term that destroys the nice long - range property of the vortices . fortunately enough , if this term is absent on the tree and one - loop level , which is the case at hand , then the coleman - hill theorem @xcite guarantees that this term will not be generated at any higher loop level ( see also ref .",

    "[ sec : physical properties ] , we calculate the flux , charge and energy of the vortex solution and of a vortex - antivortex pair . we then show that the energy of the vortex - antivortex system is finite whereas the single vortex energy is logarithmically divergent , hence the vortices are classically confined .",

    "are related to the ones in the @xmath22 theory as follows : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",

    "we set @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and use the metric @xmath47 in what follows .",
    "it is a simple exercise to study the fluctuations about the vacuum @xmath48 in eq .",

    ", we find that there is a single massive radial field @xmath50 in the infrared .",
    "in addition , the would - be goldstone boson , @xmath51 , is eaten by the massive @xmath29 field .",

    "this will be clear from our vortex solution , as is evident from eq .",
    "( [ z - boson mass ] ) below .",
    "thus , the field @xmath29 has two degrees of freedom , and we recover the total sum of the four degrees of freedom we started with .",
    "one wonders whether the condition ( [ choice of muy ] ) and hence the spectrum described above , especially the massless @xmath17 field , are not spoiled by quantum effects .",
    "in fact , a one - loop calculation in the theory described by ( [ action1 ] ) does not yield any corrections to the chern - simons terms @xcite . besides , according to the coleman - hill theorem @xcite , there are no more corrections to these topological terms other than the one - loop contribution .",
