    "our milky way galaxy is a unique laboratory in which to study galactic structure and evolution from stellar kinematics .",
    "the story of the efforts to obtain such kinematic data nicely illustrates how theoretical progress and data acquisition have to go hand in hand if one wants to gain insight into the structure and history of the galaxy . until recently ,",
    "most studies have been limited to the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the zeroth order approximation for modelling these kinematic data assumes an axisymmetric model , in which the local standard of rest ( lsr ) is on a perfectly circular orbit .",
    "however , the local velocity field in the solar neighbourhood already displays possible signatures of the non - axisymmetry of the galactic potential in the form of stellar moving groups containing stars of very different ages and chemical compositions @xcite .    in external galaxies , large - scale distortions of the ( line - of - sight ) isovelocity contours of the gas",
    "have long been recognised in two - dimensional velocity maps ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , allowing a quantification of the strength of non - circular streaming motions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a prominent example is the galaxy m81 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which has roughly the same circular velocity as the milky way and in which the radial streaming motions of the gas reach maxima of the order of 50  km s@xmath4 .",
    "however , the stellar kinematics often turn out to be slightly more regular and symmetric than the gas kinematics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for instance , @xcite estimate from 18 face - on spiral galaxies that the azimuthally averaged radial streaming motions of disk stars should typically amount to a maximum of 7  @xmath5 due to lopsided distortions and 6  @xmath5 due to intrinsic ellipticity .",
    "+ in the milky way , non - axisymmetric motions are clearly visible in radio - frequency observations of gas flow in the inner galaxy , implying that the amplitude of spiral structure could be larger by a factor @xmath61.5 than its amplitude in the near - infrared luminosity density @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , radio interferometry used to determine the parallax of star - forming regions in the perseus spiral arm , together with the measurement of their line - of - sight ( los ) velocities , show that these star - forming regions have peculiar non - circular motions amounting to @xmath620  km  s@xmath4 , assuming standard iau galactic parameters and a nearly - flat rotation curve @xcite .",
    "however , the amplitude of such non - circular motions strongly depends on the galactic parameters adopted @xcite , namely the galactocentric radius of the sun @xmath7 , the local circular speed @xmath8 , and the reflex solar motion , as well as the model for the rotation curve .",
    "another example of such non - circular motion is the 3  kpc arm which has @xmath9 towards the galactic centre ( gc ) and is known to have a counterpart on the far side of the gc @xcite .",
    "its origin is associated to the galactic bar showing that non - circular motion of the similar amplitude can be caused by various types of perturbations and not necessarily by spiral arms .",
    "+ here , we use line - of - sight velocity or line - of - sight velocity to refer to the heliocentric radial velocity measured by rave while _ radial _ velocity or @xmath10 means _",
    "galactocentric radial _ velocity ] data ( @xmath11 ) from the rave survey to investigate whether the mean radial motion of disc stars remains zero in the extended solar neighbourhood as compared to the one in the solar neighbourhood , or whether large - scale radial streaming motions are present in the vicinity of the sun , which would translate in a radial velocity gradient in one or the other direction . in sec .  2 we present the sample used for our analysis while in sec .",
    "3 we present the detection of a radial velocity gradient using rave @xmath11 , as well as the associated oort constants and 2-dimensional velocity field . finally in sec .  4 we discuss the implications of our results and present our conclusions .",
    "our analysis is based on the rave catalogue @xcite which provides @xmath11 to 2  @xmath5 and stellar atmospheric parameters and distances to 30% for a large number of bright stars in the southern hemisphere with @xmath12 using moderate resolution spectra ( r@xmath67500 ) .",
    "rave selects its targets randomly in the @xmath13-band interval , and so its properties are similar to a magnitude limited survey .",
    "the rave catalogue is cross - matched with astrometric ( ppmx , ucac2 , tycho-2 ) and photometric catalogues ( 2mass , denis ) to provide additional proper motions and magnitudes making rave a suitable tool to study the milky way .",
    "we use the latest version of the @xcite catalogue , which contains four sets of distances in addition to the standard rave data ( line - of - sight velocities and stellar parameters ) .",
    "these four sets of distances are ( i ) the distance moduli computed using three sets of isochrones ( including the padova isochrones ) , and ( ii ) the distances of @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will use the distance moduli based on the padova isochrones but our results do not strongly depend on the set of isochrones used ( see also sect.[s : oort ] where all distances are multiplied by an arbitrary factor ) .",
    "this catalogue is cleaned from potentially problematic fields using a list kindly provided by g.  matijevic ( private communication ) and we further select stars with @xmath0  kpc to minimise contamination by halo stars . this leaves us with a sample of 213713 stars with known distances , atmospheric parameters ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 $ ] ) , proper motions as well as @xmath11 measurements that can be used to compute the 3d space velocities .    to verify that our analysis does not depend on the method used to determine the distances or on the source of proper motions",
    ", we also use stars for which distances and proper motions are obtained independently . to do so , we select a sub - sample of red clump candidates for which the distance can be estimated using the @xmath2magnitude alone because of the narrow , almost gaussian , luminosity function of the red clump .",
    "red clump candidates are selected in the ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) plane , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : sample ] .",
    "we select the over - density using @xmath19 and @xmath20 : the red limit helps reduce the contamination by the upper red - giant - branch stars .",
    "distances are obtained assuming all stars in the sample are red clump stars using a gaussian luminosity function for this population with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we apply the same cut in @xmath23 as for the full sample .",
    "this results in a sample containing 29623 red clump candidates .",
    "more details on the contamination and distance errors can be found in @xcite .",
    "we cross - match this sample with the ucac3 catalogue to provide a different source for the proper motion  the rave catalogue contains predominantly tycho-2 and ppmx proper motions .",
    "hence , for this sample , the distances and proper motions are independent from the full rave sample .",

    "colour coding follows the number of stars per bin of 0.03  mag width in @xmath18 and 0.05  dex in @xmath17 .",
    "the distribution is smoothed over 3 pixels to reduce the noise .",
    "stars in the white box are identified as red - clump stars.,width=264 ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      to further investigate the velocity gradient detected with rave , we now compute the full 2d velocity field for our samples ( making use of both the line - of - sight velocities and the proper motion vectors ) .",
    "the velocity fields in the galactocentric reference frame are computed using @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the sun s velocity with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) and @xmath26 is the motion of the lsr with respect to the gc .",
    "obviously , a possible radial motion of the lsr itself can be a priori difficult to disentangle from large - scale streaming motions . in order to circumvent this , we use hereafter the standard assumption that the lsr is on a circular orbit . the velocity of stars @xmath27 is hereafter decomposed into three components in the axisymmetric galactocentric reference frame @xmath28 , @xmath29 pointing towards the south galactic pole .",
    "this projection depends on two parameters : @xmath7 , the distance to the centre of the galaxy and @xmath8 , the local circular speed .",
    "unfortunately , as pointed out by @xcite , neither of these parameters are well constrained .",
    "the ratio @xmath30 is however better constrained , lying in the range @xmath31  km s@xmath4 kpc@xmath4 with some impact on the measured @xmath25 as shown in table 1 and 2 of @xcite .",
    "therefore , we compute the 2d velocity maps for two sets of parameters . in both cases we fix @xmath25 to the values of @xcite .",
    "the first set of parameters uses the standard iau values @xmath32  km s@xmath4 and @xmath33  kpc while for the second set we use the model 2 from table  2 of @xcite , @xmath34  km s@xmath4 and @xmath35  kpc , which has a solar motion vector close to the latest determination by @xcite .",
    "the results for the 2d @xmath36 and @xmath37 velocity maps in the galactic plane for a @xmath38  kpc box ( @xmath39 bins ) centred on the sun are presented in figs .",
    "[ f : full ] and [ f : fullvphi ] for both sets of parameters and for both samples ( full sample and red clump selection ) .",
    "x and y increase towards the gc and in the direction of galactic rotation respectively .",
    "this places the gc either at ( 8,0 ) or ( 7.8,0 ) depending on the galactic parameters used . the solar circle ( @xmath40 )",
    "is drawn as a dashed line and the open circle delimits a zone 125  pc in radius similar to the hipparcos sphere .",
    "for orientation , the location of the local ( orion ) and perseus arms are indicated based on the co map of @xcite .",
    "no strong kinematic signal is associated with them in @xmath41 , but a strong decrease of @xmath37 is associated with the orion arm ( while little data are available on the perseus arm ) .",
    "this could help place limits on the size of the potential perturbations associated with these arms , but is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "[ f : full ] and [ f : fullvphi ] , comparing the top and bottom panels , is similar for both samples .",
    "small differences exist on local scales , especially around ( x , y)@xmath47(0.8,@xmath48 ) , but aside from this region the velocity trends are compatible .",
    "isocontours in @xmath49 are orientated about @xmath50 from the direction to the gc and do not follow a particular symmetry axis of our procedure or sample . within the local neighbourhood indicated by the open circle , no net motion is detected and our values are compatible with previous measurements . the velocity gradient becomes noticeable only outside the hipparcos sphere .    comparing left and right panels of figs .",
    "[ f : full ] and [ f : fullvphi ] , we see that using updated galactic parameters does influence the measured mean motions . in particular , in fig .",
    "[ f : full ] it diminishes but does not eliminate the mean motions . trying to minimise the gradient while keeping the ratio @xmath30 constant , leads to unrealistic values for the galactic parameters with @xmath51  kpc and @xmath52  km s@xmath4 .",
    "in this paper , making use of rave line - of - sight velocities and distances alone , we report the discovery of a radial velocity gradient in the galactic disc amounting to at least 3  km s@xmath4 kpc@xmath4 observed in the direction of the gc for @xmath53  kpc . making use of the full sample , we fitted the oort constants in the classical way , and obtained values globally in agreement with those of od03 for old red giants . but as their measurement was based on proper motions alone , they could not constrain the value of the oort constant @xmath2 , which we estimate here to be roughly between 4 and 6 km  s@xmath4  kpc@xmath4 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "then , assuming a zero radial velocity of the local standard of rest , we reconstructed the 2d velocity map , and found that the galactic parameters do play a role in the measured amplitude of the streaming motion . adopting standard iau values ,",
    "which are suspected to underestimate @xmath30 , yields a larger amplitude . on the other hand ,",
    "using more recent values for @xmath8 and @xmath7 reduces the net radial motion but does not eliminate it .",
    "the latter result is independent of the source of proper motions and distances used .",
    "we note that the confirmed existence of such a net outwards motion for stars , amounting to 10% of the circular speed , would raise the question of the validity of determining the galactic parameters based on the assumption of circular motion ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the error bars on the measured ratio @xmath30 are likely underestimated .",
    "we however also note that , in order to establish it more firmly , our result should imperatively be confirmed by further line - of - sight velocity measurements at lower latitudes with future spectroscopic surveys ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is indeed very intriguing that a strong 21-cm absorption feature along the line - of - sight to the gc is compatible with a zero mean velocity relative to the lsr ( radhakrishnan & sarma 1980 ) .",
    "the cause of such a large - scale streaming motion would clearly be a non - axisymmetric component of the galactic potential .",
    "it could thus be due to : ( @xmath54 the galactic bar ; ( @xmath55 spiral arms ; ( @xmath56 the warp ; ( @xmath57 a triaxial dark matter halo ; or ( @xmath58 a combination of some or all of these components . indeed , @xcite have simulated the effect of spiral density waves on the oort constants and have showed that for spiral - only perturbations , the value of @xmath59 is larger for lower stellar velocity dispersions , contrary to the findings of od03 .",
    "the observed trend in @xmath3 could , however , be explained with the effect of the galactic bar @xcite , but not its exact magnitude .",
    "actually , given that the milky way disk contains both spiral arms and a central bar , the effect of both these perturbers needs to be considered simultaneously . in external galaxies , such as m81 ,",
    "such non - circular motions in gas flows are usually associated with spiral arms and/or the central bar .",
    "@xcite have also placed bounds on the ellipticity of the outer dark matter haloes of external galaxies from the observed non - circular motions ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it will be of the highest interest to determine which model will best reproduce the trend we report in this paper . however , it is unlikely that we will be able to discriminate between the various models with such a small fraction of the milky way sampled .",
    "more , deeper observations from future astrometric and spectroscopic surveys will probably be mandatory in this respect .",
    "observations of non - circular motions of gas in the inner galaxy determine the characteristics of the central region of the milky way and constrain the parameters of , for example , the galactic bar and the amount of dark matter allowed inside the solar circle ( see , for instance , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is likely that mapping and understanding the non - circular motions in the outer parts of the milky way will reveal similarly important information about the galactic potential and the mass distribution on larger scales .",
