    "the spin down luminosity of a rotating pulsar powers the emission of an associated synchrotron nebula by driving an initially poynting flux - dominated wind ( the poynting - to - matter energy flux ratio is @xmath4 ) that flows along the open magnetic field lines .",
    "the density of the outflowing matter is enhanced by pair - creating cascades near the source and the resulting number density is sufficiently large to screen the electric field along the flow and provide the necessary charge and current densities for ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) to hold .    at a distance @xmath5 cm specifically for the crab  the ram pressure of the wind equals the total nebula pressure and the wind terminates in a standing shock @xcite .",
    "the `` wisps '' ( which appear at distance @xmath6 from the center ) are an observational signature of the coupling between the fast pulsar wind and the slowly expanding nebula @xcite . by applying ideal mhd in the nebula , the matching shock conditions require that the pulsar wind has become completely matter - dominated at the position of the shock ; the @xmath2 function should be as low as @xmath7 just upstream of the termination shock ( kennel & coroniti 1984a , b ) , and the question arises as to how this transition from high to low values of @xmath2 can happen , the so - called @xmath2 problem .",
    "we note , however , that the very existence of the shock has been questioned by @xcite , who argues that no shock is necessary and that the observed emission is created by current dissipation in a poynting flux - dominated wind . furthermore ,",
    "even if a shock indeed terminates the pulsar wind , abandoning the axisymmetry or the ideal mhd in the nebula results in undetermined @xmath8 @xcite .",

    "several alternative ( non - ideal mhd ) attempts ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) gave unsatisfactory results , and the puzzle remains unsolved for almost three decades .",
    "however , there are in the literature @xmath10 self - similar , ideal mhd solutions that start with @xmath4 near the origin of the flow and reach @xmath11 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , or even more efficient accelerators with @xmath12 @xcite , or @xmath13 @xcite .",

    "we may write @xmath15 , thus the maximum final lorentz factor is attained in solutions with @xmath16 . in this paper",

    "one possibility is that the acceleration does not continue even with slightly different line shape , resulting in the fourth column case .",

    "this situation corresponds to a continuous acceleration under a parabolic ii or iia shape ( second column ) .",
    "we note , however , that for realistic applications , the interaction of an outflow with its environment brakes - down the ideal mhd conditions and this probably happens before the realization of this last part of the acceleration .",
    "chiueh et al . (",
    "1991 ) examined the far - asymptotics of relativistic mhd outflows , generalizing the work on nonrelativistic flows by @xcite .",
    "they assumed that the various quantities become functions of @xmath21 alone ( the characteristic of the far - asymptotic regime ) , neglected the poloidal centrifugal term @xmath381 as well as terms of order @xmath382 in the transfield equation , and found that conical field lines satisfying @xmath383 should enclose a finite current @xmath384 ( the solvability condition at infinity , see  [ character ] ) .",

    "our self - similar solutions fall in this category : the condition @xmath386 is not satisfied , because @xmath387 .    as we see in table [ table1 ]",
    "the solvability condition at infinity is mandatory only for the fifth column . as a result we may have , e.g. , nonrelativistic conical or type i / ia parabolic flows that carry",

    "a first step towards finding nonrelativistic mhd solutions with @xmath391 is the super modified fast - magnetosound solution of @xcite , which ends slightly after the modified fast singular point with @xmath392 .",

    "do not allow us to derive semianalytical solutions in that regime .    as we discuss in ",
    "[ genanalysis ] , an important requirement for the above mechanism to work is that @xmath361 . in fact , as we argue below , such a configuration is most likely to happen near the equator .",
    "the pulsar magnetosphere has been traditionally considered as being force - free , and inertial effects are usually neglected . on the other hand , it is generally accepted that it is because of the inertia that the magnetic field line topology becomes open and an azimuthal magnetic field component is created . moreover , the pair creation and their acceleration to high lorentz factors ( e.g. , @xcite ) involve non - ideal mhd effects that may be important in the final form of the magnetosphere .",
    "a question arises : is the force - free a good approximation ?",
    "@xcite have solved the force - free problem ( although with the current - closure not fully satisfied ) and @xcite have repeated their numerical work with higher resolution , deriving similar results .",
    "the usual problem with the force - free dynamics is that the condition @xmath394 is not always satisfied , since the bernoulli equation that relates the electromagnetic field with the lorentz factor of the system of reference where the electric field vanishes , is omitted ( see eq .

    "this is indeed the case in the aforementioned force - free solution . according to @xcite the drift velocity becomes larger than the light speed at distance a few times the light cylinder ( their figure 5 shows that typically this happens at cylindrical distance @xmath396 )",

    "the problem related to negative azimuthal speeds comes from equation ( [ forcefree1 ] ) .",
    "the second part of the right - hand side is much smaller than unity very close to the source in a possible corotating regime , and should increase up to an asymptotic value equal to unity as we move to larger @xmath83 ( in order to have a negligible asymptotic azimuthal speed ) . practically speaking",
    ", the ratio @xmath401 should be @xmath402 at distances @xmath403 a few .",
    "after that point @xmath404 , and this continues to be the case even in the superfast ( non - force - free ) regime where both the @xmath150 and the @xmath227 decrease .",
    "but , what happens relatively close to the light cylinder ? the poloidal field lines follow the dipolar shape up to the point where they approach the equator , but then they remain parallel to it for some distance . we know that a relativistic flow is difficult to bend and this is a characteristic of a force - free regime as well .",
    "the curvature @xmath26 is of the order of @xmath405 , meaning that at distances @xmath403 a few , the poloidal field lines are practically straight .",
    "holds if we assume that @xmath406 in eq .",
    "( [ transfield ] ) .",
    "very close to the midplane , the field may change in a small scale .",
    "in addition , the pressure gradient term may be important .",
    "it is because of these two effects that the field lines do not cross the equator . ] as a result , the quantity @xmath23 increases , because the surface between two neighboring field lines increases slower that @xmath407 . for a force - free case where @xmath150 remains constant , we get a decreasing ratio @xmath408 .",
    "since its asymptotic value should be unity , near the source is larger than unity , implying @xmath409 .",
    "in fact @xcite found negative azimuthal velocities .",
    "the only way to avoid this effect in the framework of force - free field , is to have very small initial poloidal velocity ( @xmath410 ) , meaning that our `` initial '' surface is very close to the pulsar .",
    "however , in that case we should take into account non - ideal effects related to the pair creation region .    a solution to this problem",
    "could be that the flow in the regime where the lines remain approximately parallel to the equator is _ decelerating _ , meaning that kinetic ( or enthalpy ) energy flux is transfered to poynting , and the @xmath2 function increases .",
    "in that case , the @xmath411 would increase and cancel the increase of @xmath227 in the expression of @xmath412 , resulting in @xmath413 . during the phase where the flow is approximately parallel to the equator ,",
    "the @xmath414 increases almost linearly with @xmath24 ( @xmath415 with @xmath416 ) .",
    "since the @xmath417 is forced to follow this increase ( in order to be consistent with a negligible azimuthal motion ) , the matter energy part is decreasing linearly with @xmath418 , and an important ( or even the most significant ) part of the poynting flux may be created there . as the flow decelerates , at some point it reaches @xmath419 . only after that point the curvature of the poloidal field lines @xmath420 may be important and the lines start to expand to larger heights above the equator .",
    "the expansion in principle allows for acceleration ( if @xmath421 increases faster than @xmath349 ) , and this time the electromagnetic energy is transfered to the matter .",
    "we consider this point as the origin of the ideal mhd regime that we examine in this paper .",
    "another problem comes when we consider the `` last '' current loop ( @xmath422 ) that closes on the equator . along this equatorial current line",
    "the azimuthal magnetic field vanishes .",
    "since @xmath423 , the inequality @xmath394 holds only in the unlikely case where the poloidal field also vanishes on the equator . the remaining case is to include non - ideal mhd effects ( then the electric field is not equal to @xmath424 and @xmath425 could be positive ) .    although the details of the full magnetosphere remain to be explored , and this requires to solve the full problem ( not only the non - force - free , but also the non - ideal mhd especially near the `` last '' current line that closes on the equator ; not to mention the inner / outer gaps and the non - axisymmetry ) , the picture described above looks appealing and consistent with the observed crab - pulsar equatorial wind .",
    "the scenario also explains why the quantities @xmath426 , @xmath427 , and @xmath428 are likely @xmath0 just after the end of this `` parallel to the equator '' phase .",
    "these are the `` initial '' conditions for the ideal mhd phase",
    ". it may not be just a coincidence that the efficient and faster than logarithmic acceleration to low-@xmath2 values during the ideal mhd phase was possible for these `` initial '' conditions only .",
    "note also that the part of the total open magnetic flux that contributes to the `` parallel to the equator '' phase , is @xmath429 ( for exactly dipolar field , @xmath430 of the open magnetic flux correspond to field lines that have @xmath431 when cross the light cylinder ) .",
    "the rest @xmath429 of the open field lines likely follows a dipolar shape till @xmath432 a few , and then becomes conical ia ( again @xmath433 is negligible ) .",
    "since there is no obvious reason for an increasing @xmath227 , the acceleration gives asymptotically @xmath434 or @xmath435 , if the initial @xmath225 value is @xmath436 or @xmath437 , respectively .",

    "the `` initial '' conditions @xmath362 are in principle possible in other astrophysical settings as well , such as gamma - ray burst sources or agns .",
    "for example , a corona or a thermal / radiation pressure field may keep the field lines that emanate from a disk parallel to each other ( at least for some distance ) , in which case the product @xmath440 again increases and a matter energy - to - poynting flux transformation is realized ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in the first part of the paper (   [ governing ] , [ superalfvenic ] ) we derived the ideal mhd equations that describe the super - alfvnic asymptotic regime . the resulting system of equations remains intractable enough , and we could only find a @xmath30 self - similar model (   [ zss ] ) describing the regime near the rotation axis .",
    "we regard the solution @xmath256 as the best representative result of that model .",
    "it includes all the expected characteristics of an efficient mhd accelerator , in particular :    * the transition from @xmath441 to @xmath18 , showing that ideal mhd can account for the full acceleration , resulting in a matter - dominated flow . * the transition from a current - carrying to a return - current regime , showing how the poloidal current lines close . * the transition from positive to negative poloidal curvature radius . when the flow becomes",
