    "a major breakthrough in condensed matter physics took place when k. s. novoselov _",
    "@xcite , at manchester university , uk , discovered an electric field effect in atomically thin carbon films .",
    "this electric field effect is characterized by the control of the electronic density in the films using a backgate setup .",
    "these atomically thin carbon films were thought not to exist since long range order in two dimension can not occur .",
    "the system solves the apparent paradox by forming ripples .",
    "a single atomic layer of these thin carbon films is called graphene and its electric and magneto - electric properties triggered a new research field in condensed matter physics .",
    "the manufacture of graphene was followed by the production of other 2d crystals@xcite , which , however , have not the same exciting properties as graphene does .",
    "applying high magnetic fields to a graphene sample , the manchester group discovered that the quantization rule for the hall conductivity is not the same one observes in the two - dimensional electron gas , being given instead by@xcite",
    "@xmath0    with @xmath1 an integer including zero .",
    "a confirmation of this result was independently obtained by philip kim s group@xcite , at colombia university , new york , usa .",
    "this new quantum hall effect was predicted by two groups working independently and using different methods @xcite . as explained by the two groups",
    "the new quantization rule for the hall conductivity is a consequence of the dispersion relation of the electrons in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "this dispersion resembles the spectrum of ultra relativistic particles , i.e. , the dispersion is that of particles of zero rest mass and an effective velocity of light . for graphene the effective velocity of light is @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the true velocity of light .    for a qualitative description of the physics of graphene ,",

    "the two bands touch each other in six points of the brillouin zone , called dirac points.,width=302 ]    in figure [ fig_dispersion ] we show the energy dispersion of electrons in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the spectrum shows a valence ( lower ) and a conduction ( upper ) bands .",
    "since graphene has one electron per unit cell the valence band is completely filled and the properties of the system are determined by the nature of its spectrum close to the points where the valence and the conduction bands touch each other .",
    "these points are called dirac points and are in number of six . in figure [ fig_cone ]",
    "we show the spectrum close to the dirac points .",
    "it is clear that the spectrum has conical shape of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the magnitude of the momentum @xmath6 around the dirac point .",
    "a relativistic particle has an energy given by @xmath7 and therefore an ultra - relativistic particle ( @xmath8 ) has a spectrum given by @xmath9 it is clear from equation ( [ ur ] ) that electrons in graphene , close to the dirac points , have an energy dispersion with a formal equivalence to ultra - relativistic particles . as a consequence the quantum properties of the system has to be described by the massless ( ultra - relativistic ) dirac equation in two plus one dimensions .",
    "we are interested in studying the spectrum of massless dirac particles in the presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane and an in plane homogeneous electric field , both static , a situation that occurs in the hall effect . in the next section we present a full algebraic solution to this quantum problem .",

    "this substitution transforms the dirac equation into an eigenvalue problem of the form @xmath18 the introduction of a magnetic field into a quantum mechanical problem is made by transforming the momentum operator according to the rule ( minimal coupling ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the vector potential and @xmath21 is the charge of the particle .",
