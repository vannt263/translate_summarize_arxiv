    "in the last decade , galaxy - size gravitational lenses have become an increasingly important tool for the study of cosmology and galaxy evolution .",
    "the number of known lenses has now reached almost 100 ( see the castles web page at http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/castles/ ) , and subsets of lenses with suitable properties are now available for a variety of applications : the determination of the cosmological parameters from lens statistics ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the measurement of the hubble constant from lens time delays ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the study of the mass distribution of e / s0 galaxies and their dark matter halos outside the local universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite the great progress , the small subsample sizes of suitable lenses is a major limitation .",
    "this is particularly true for the study of the properties of lens galaxies ( typically e / s0s ) .",
    "most currently known lenses have been discovered as bright quasars that show multiple images when observed at high spatial resolution . for optical quasar lenses ,",
    "this biases the sample in favor of systems where the lensed source outshines the lens galaxy .",
    "radio surveys such as the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are less susceptible to this bias , but redshifts in radio lens systems can be difficult to obtain , and the lensing galaxies are often faint .",
    "this situation makes it very difficult to obtain high - quality photometry , redshifts , and internal kinematics of lens galaxies , which are essential ingredients for detailed modeling .",
    "it is not a coincidence that 3/5 lenses analyzed by the lenses structure and dynamics survey ( lsd ; @xcite ; hereafter collectively kt ) so far have been discovered serendipitously in hubble space telescope ( hst ) images .    to overcome this limitation",
    "we have initiated the sloan lens acs ( slacs ) survey , a new survey for gravitational lenses that exploits the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) archive and the angular resolution of hst to find and confirm new gravitational lenses .",
    "first , a large sample of sdss early - type galaxy spectra is searched for emission lines at a higher redshift than that of the absorption features ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . by requiring that the foreground galaxy dominate the absorption spectrum , this procedure will tend to select bright lenses with faint background sources .",
    "the second step consists of follow - up snapshot observations of the best candidates with the advanced camera for survey ( acs ) to confirm the incidence of lensing and provide the lens geometry necessary to construct a mass model .",
    "each candidate is observed for 420 seconds in each of f435w and f814w .",
    "the f435w filter is selected to optimize the detection of the lensed source galaxy ( expected to be blue and starforming ) while f814w is selected to optimize the signal - to - noise ratio on the ( red ) lens galaxy .",
    "color information also provides important evidence in support of the lensing hypothesis . in this _ letter _",
    "we present the first newly discovered lens , along with acs images and gemini gmos - north integral - field spectroscopy and a lens model , and discuss its overall properties .",
    "we assume that the hubble constant , the matter density , and the cosmological constant are h@xmath14  kms@xmath4mpc@xmath4 ( with @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "all spectroscopic wavelengths are given in vacuum values .",
    "the original spectroscopic observations of sdssj1402 were obtained on sdss plate 605 , fiber 503 , mjd 52353 ( included in the public data release 2 ) .",
    "the latest public sdss photometric values for the galaxy are @xmath18 , all @xmath19 , and it forms part of the volume - limited luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) spectroscopic sample @xcite .",
    "the specbs one - dimensional spectroscopic pipeline ( schlegel et al . , in preparation ; see also @xcite ) determines a redshift @xmath20 and a velocity dispersion of 267 @xmath3 17 km s@xmath4 for sdssj1402 .",
    "though the spectrum is unambiguously that of an early - type galaxy at the above redshift , it also exhibits nebular line emission at a background redshift of @xmath21 ( see figure 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "given the measured stellar velocity dispersion and these redshifts and assuming a singular isothermal sphere galaxy model , one navely expects a strong - lensing region of radius @xmath22 ( twice the einstein radius ) in the plane of the sky , centered on the foreground galaxy .",
    "considering the @xmath23 radius of an sdss spectrograph fiber aperture , the prior probability of the system being a strong gravitational lens is essentially unity if one neglects the effects of seeing and fiber misalignment , and it was therefore targeted for follow - up observation",
    ". +      _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst )",
    "observations of sdssj1402 were obtained on 2004 august 4 with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , with one 420-second exposure in each of the filters f435w and f814w .",
    "the 5-@xmath24 limits are approximately @xmath25magarcsec@xmath26 and @xmath27magarcsec@xmath26 in 2@xmath282-pixel apertures",
    ". the brief exposure times result in comic rays affecting @xmath29@xmath30% of all pixels",
    ". these are very effectively flagged and cleaned using the laplacian edge - detection technique ( `` lacosmic '' ) of @xcite .",
    "the cosmics - cleaned images are spatially transformed to an orthogonal coordinate system by the multidrizzle routine as implemented on pyraf by stsci .",
    "this allows for high - precision astrometry and spatially - correct galaxy shapes . in each band , a 2d model of the lensing galaxy is computed using galfit @xcite .",
    "the fits are done assuming a simple srsic profile parametrized by index @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is an exponential , and @xmath33 is a de  vaucouleur profile ) , as well as assuming a constrained de  vaucouleur profile .",
    "the latter is especially useful for comparison with fundamental plane results .",
    "the srsic fits are sufficiently accurate to produce high - quality residual images , which are used to measure the positions of candidate lensed images .",
    "these are identified both by their image configurations and by their similarity in @xmath34 colors .",
    "the constrained de  vaucouleur fit to the f814w galaxy image gives a model magnitude of @xmath35 , an isophotal axis ratio @xmath36 , a position angle @xmath37 east of north , and an intermediate - axis effective ( half - light ) radius of @xmath38 .",
    "fixing the galaxy shape from these f814w de  vaucouleurs structural parameters and fitting for a magnitude in the f435 image yields @xmath39 .",
    "the unconstrained srsic fit to the f814w data has an index of @xmath40 , indicating a high degree of central concentration .",
    "figure  [ ims ] shows the acs f435w and f814w images and galaxy - subtracted f435w residual image of sdssj1402 . despite low signal - to - noise , four images with similar colors",
    "are easily identifiable in both filters with a typical quad - like configuration ; we designate these images a  d .",
    "two of the images ( a and b ) appear arc - like in both filters and stretched tangentially .",
    "we determine image centroids from the f435w image , in which they are more pronounced and less affected by residuals from the foreground galaxy subtraction .",
    "table  [ imtable ] lists these image positions relative to the lrg centroid .",
    "we describe the determination of a gravitational - lens model based on these image positions in   [ lensmod ] below .",
    ".astrometry of the lensed images of sdssj1402 .",
    "[ imtable ] [ cols=\"^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      to solidify the lensing hypothesis over alternative explanations for the observed features , we look to spatially resolved spectroscopy of sdssj1402 obtained with the integral - field unit ( ifu ) of the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos - n ) on the 8-meter gemini north telescope at mauna kea @xcite .",
    "the observations were made using the r600 grating and a sloan @xmath41-band blocking filter to prevent spectral overlap and allow use of the full @xmath42 ifu field of view .",
    "the total integration time was 3@xmath28900 seconds , and the data were reduced using custom ifu software written in idl ( bolton & burles , in preparation ) .",
    "in addition to the acs data , figure  [ ims ] also shows a reconstructed ifu narrow - band image of a 5-  window about the redshifted [ o iii ] 5008.24  emission , after subtraction of a linear fit to the lrg continuum at that wavelength .",
    "the emission is spatially coincident with the assumed lensed images in the hst - acs data .",
    "independent confirmation of the identification of this line emission as redshifted [ oiii ] is provided by summing the spectra in circular apertures about the appoximate image positions to obtain the spectrum presented in figure  [ ifu_fig ] , showing both lines of the [ oiii ] doublet in the expected 1:3 ratio , as well as h@xmath43 .",
    "we thus confirm that the redshift of the faint images is much higher than that of the lrg , further supporting a lensing interpretation .",
    "adopting a lensing hypothesis for sdssj1402 , we model the lens as a simple singular isothermal ellipsoidal ( sie ) mass model without external shear , using the astrometry of the four images as constraints .",
    "using the mass normalization from @xcite , the best - fit ( @xmath44 for ndf=3 ) gives an einstein radius @xmath45  ( 68% cl ) , corresponding to a sie velocity dispersion of @xmath46  km / s  km / s ( within a 3@xmath47 diameter aperture ) .",
    "_ prior _ to the acs observations we predicted @xmath48 based on this dispersion , leading to the selection as lens candidate . ] and a physical radius of @xmath49 kpc . the axial ratio and position angle ( in the frame of figure  [ ims ] ) of the ellipsoidal equal surface density contours are @xmath50 and @xmath51  degrees , respectively .",
    "this lens - model ellipticity is in good agreement with the ellipticity of the galaxy isophotes given in ",
    "[ acs ] . the galaxy and lens - model position angles are",
    "also significantly aligned , although they differ formally by @xmath52 .    the total mass - to - light ratio within the einstein radius is robustly determined by the data , and we compute it as follows .",
    "the total mass enclosed by the critical curve is @xmath53  m@xmath54 : we derive this from the fitted lens model , but it is in fact largely model independent . from aperture photometry ,",
    "the corresponding enclosed magnitude is @xmath55 . using a specbs template fitted to the spectrum of sdssj1402 and an acs - f435w filter curve , we compute a @xmath56-correction of 1.20 for the lens galaxy . combining this with a distance modulus of 40.17 from our assumed cosmology",
    ", we obtain an absolute @xmath57 magnitude of @xmath58 enclosed by the lensed images , with an estimated 0.05-magnitude systematic error in the conversion . finally , we convert from the @xmath59 system to johnson @xmath10 via @xmath60 , giving an absolute @xmath10 magnitude of @xmath61 . for an absolute solar magnitude of @xmath62 @xcite ,",
    "the rest - frame @xmath10-band luminosity within the einstein radius is then @xmath63 .",
    "thus the enclosed @xmath10-band mass - to - light ratio is @xmath64 in solar units .",
    "if we assume the stars to be test particles embedded in an isothermal mass distribution with the above given mass , with a luminosity density derived from the stellar surface brightness ( e.g.see kt03 or tk04 for details ) , we find a luminosity - weighted stellar dispersion of @xmath65  kms@xmath4 within the sdss apperture , assuming an isotropic dispersion tensor .",
    "this agrees very well with the observed stellar dispersion .",
    "future work will present a more detailed dynamical analysis based on the determination of an extended kinematic profile or field ( e.g.  with integral - field spectroscopy ) .    with this mass model",
    ", we proceed to _ invert _ the lensed images to obtain the structure of the source ( e.g.  @xcite ; see also @xcite for more details ) .",
    "we regularize the solution by adding a term to the penalty function that suppresses the curvature ( see press et al .",
    "1992 ) of the resulting source brightness distribution . during the single - step inversion process",
    "the mass model remains fixed .",
    "we use psf models generated with tiny - tim , although the results are insensitive to the precise psf model because of the low s / n of the images .",
    "the f435w results are shown in figure  [ model_comb ] , for a regularization that gives @xmath66 .",
    "we see that the source has a roundish monotonically - decreasing brightness distribution , close to and inside the fold caustic . in the f814w filter ( not shown ) , the source is found at the same position and with similar structure . also shown",
    "are the lensed source model and residuals .",
    "the latter show no significant remaining structure and are distributed gaussian .",
    "we find that models with parameters within the 68% cl of the best - fit sie model values give similar results , but can not be distinguished at a significant level because of the low s / n of the images .",
    "hence , the lens inversion should for now be regarded only as a consistency check of the lens model .",
    "based on the following evidence , we conclude that sdssj1402 is a lens system :    1 .   the discovery of emission - lines in the sdss spectrum at a redshift significantly larger than that of the high-@xmath67 lrg and within a 1.5@xmath47 radius from the galaxy centroid , and confirmed by follow - up gmos - n ifu spectroscopy .",
    "2 .   the discovery of four images ( with two tangentially stretched ) in a typical quad - lens - like configuration around the galaxy in _ hubble space telescope _ images , with similar colors and positions between f814w and f435w filters . 3 .   the spatial coincidence of these images with the higher - redshift line emission , as shown by gmos - n ifu spectroscopy .",
    "the excellent goodness - of - fit ( @xmath68 ) for the sie mass model ( no external shear ) .",
    "the stellar velocity dispersion predicted by this mass model and the observed luminosity density is in excellent agreement with the sdss value , and the galaxy and lens - model ellipticities and position angles are in significant agreement with one another .",
    "a direct inversion of the lensed image  based solely on the sie mass model determined from the image positions  leads to a very simple compact source structure in both f814w and f435w filters at the same position near the inside of the fold caustic .    hence , despite the relatively low signal - to - noise of the lensed images , the spectral and imaging data of sdssj1402 presented in this paper , in conjunction with the self - consistent lens model , convincingly show that the _ first _ candidate observed by the slacs survey is also the _ first _ genuine lens system from the program ! the lens geometry and hst photometry yield a ( largely model - independent ) measurement of @xmath8  m@xmath54 and a rest - frame @xmath10-band mass - to - light ratio of @xmath11 times solar within the @xmath49-kpc cylinder enclosed by the critical curve .",
    "spatially resolved kinematic observations of this system will permit more detailed lens / dynamical modeling , which will constrain the radial mass profile and the relative fraction of luminous to dark matter in the central region of the lensing galaxy .",
