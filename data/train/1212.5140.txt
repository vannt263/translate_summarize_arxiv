    "in the description of a physical problem dealing with light - matter interaction there is always a degree of freedom in the choice of the potentials associated with the electromagnetic field .",
    "even though the physical phenomena are obviously independent from the particular vector or scalar potentials used , the choice of the gauge is a critical issue , as it can be more or less adequate for the physical interpretation of the phenomena . in the literature",
    "there is already a consensus that the interaction of non - relativistic bound charges is very conveniently expressed in terms of the dipole gauge @xcite .",
    "this has been firstly identified by power and zienau in the 50 s @xcite and subsequently by woolley @xcite . in this formulation , called power - zienau - woolley ( pzw ) gauge , the sources are electric and magnetic polarization fields and the coupling occurs via the intensities of the displacement field @xmath0 and the magnetic field @xmath1 rather than using the scalar and vector potentials @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in the case",
    "where the magnetic interactions in the system can be neglected , the pzw gauge is also called dipole gauge since the interaction hamiltonian contains only the coupling between the material polarization @xmath4 with the light field .    in our article",
    "we propose to apply the dipole gauge to the case of intersubband transitions interacting with a photonic cavity mode .",
    "the motivation of our approach stems from the fact that we are interested to investigate a regime , called `` ultra - strong coupling '' firstly introduced by ciuti et al .",
    "@xcite . this regime of light - matter interaction is attainable in a bi - dimensional electron gas with very high density embedded into a photonic microcavity @xcite and is characterized by the fact that the coupling and the material excitation energies are comparable quantities",
    ". however , the very high electronic densities increase on one hand the light - matter interaction and on the other renormalise the transition energies of the system due to a collective effect , the `` depolarization shift '' @xcite .",
    "this effect can not be neglected in the limit of ultra - strong coupling , however it was not explicitly considered in the initial study described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our work",
    "we show that the dipole gauge hamiltonian handles the light - matter interaction and the depolarization effect on the same footing .",
    "the underlying physical picture is that the active polarization that couples to the photonic mode is not a single particle electronic transition between confined states but rather a collective electronic mode , - a plasmonic mode - , arising from electrons distributed in different subbands , yet phased by the coulomb interaction .",
    "the latter point is one of the main conclusions of our theoretical investigation .",
    "the correct description of the collective electronic excitations and their interaction with light can be obtained in the coulomb gauge , only if both the vector potential @xmath3 and scalar potential @xmath2 are considered .",
    "this has already been noticed in studies of ensembles of two level systems interacting with light @xcite . in the absence of the cavity ,",
    "thus in the weak coupling limit , collective effects can be identified with the scalar potential @xmath2 @xcite , which describes an instantaneous interaction between electrons @xcite . however , when dealing with the resonant coupling of a microcavity with an electronic transition the observable quantity is the retarded electromagnetic field that can be obtained through a proper combination of both @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite . in order to have a general hamiltonian , which is valid from the weak to the ultra - strong coupling regimes",
    ", it is therefore essential to include the coulomb potential @xmath2 , thus completing the study of ref . @xcite .",
    "such hamiltonian is readily obtained in the dipole gauge , where the matter degrees of freedom are gathered in the polarization field @xmath4 , which not only describes the interactions between the electrons , but also couples to a material independent and retarded photonic field described by the electric displacement @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "indeed , as we previously pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the depolarization effect in the bi - dimensional electron gas is contained in the quadratic @xmath5 term of the dipolar hamiltonian . as a result",
    ", our model correctly describes the local field effects arising from the very different spatial scales between the electronic and photonic confinement .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are contained in our formalism and recovered only in the opposite limit , i.e. when the electronic polarization fills the whole cavity volume .",
    "the importance of the spatial overlap factor was also outlined in our experimental study of the ultra - strong coupling regime @xcite as it allows to correlate both polaritonic and weak - coupling absorption data . on a more fundamental level , we show how the spatial confinement of the electronic polarization leads to the no - go theorem for intersubband transitions @xcite .    our paper is organized as follows . in part [ part_i ]",
    "we establish the hamiltonian of the system in the dipole gauge .",
    "we consider a very general case of an arbitrary heterostructure embedded into a general planar waveguide multilayer .",
    "the microscopic expression of the intersubband polarization field is derived in section [ sec_microdefp ] , in the long - wavelength approximation .",
    "this microscopic expression relies directly on the electronic wavefunctions , and therefore allows to go beyond the semi - classical model employed in ref.@xcite , as it applies to an arbitrary heterostructure potential , with an arbitrary number of occupied subbands .",
    "in part [ part_ii ] we adapt the general dipolar hamiltonian obtained in part [ part_i ] to the case of a series of highly doped quantum wells and we express it in terms of the collective electronic excitations of the system .",
    "we also provide a version of this `` plasma hamiltonian '' for the case of 0d resonators ( section [ sec_0d ] ) . in section [ min_coupling_gauge ]",
    "we study the correspondence between the plasma hamiltonian , truncated for the case of a single intersubband transition and a single waveguide mode , and the corresponding hamiltonian in the coulomb gauge .",
    "this allows us to connect our formalism with previous work @xcite .",
    "in particular , we show that the dipole gauge provides automatically the relevant contributions due to the coulomb interaction of the system , that were missing in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the formalism is applied to study the properties of the polariton states in part [ part_iii ] . in section [ sec_dispersion ]",
    "we examine the polariton dispersion , and in section [ sec_nogo ] we discuss the no - go theorem for intersubband transitions .",
    "we show in section [ dielfuncsection ] that our formalism is consistent with the effective medium approach , in full agreement with what has been proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "most of the technical details have been gathered in the appendixes .",
    "the interaction between light and quantum heterostructures is usually studied in planar multilayered systems .",
    "this geometry is most naturally compatible with the epitaxial growth .",
    "a very general system is described in figure [ fig1](a ) .",
    "it consists of homogeneous , non - absorbing and non - dispersive dielectric layers described by real dielectric constants @xmath6 , embedded between two infinite semiplanes that act as optical claddings .",
    "we can then define a piecewise dielectric function @xmath7 , with @xmath8 in the @xmath9 layer , @xmath10 being the growth axis .",
    "the multi - layered dielectric stack defines guided modes that confine the light field around the heterostructures .",
    "note that , at this point , @xmath7 does not include the resonant contribution from the electronic transition in the heterostructres .",
    "this contribution will be included through the coupling between the guided modes and the electronic polarization .",
    "the full hamiltonian of the system writes :    @xmath11    here @xmath12 is the hamiltonian of the electron gas in the heterostructures , which is provided explicitly in section [ sec_h_e ] , and @xmath13 is the photon hamiltonian :    @xmath14 } d^3 \\mathbf{r}\\ ] ]    with @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively the displacement field and the magnetic field operators .",

    "this is a central quantity in our theory , and it is provided explicitly in section [ sec_microdefp ] from a microscopic model .",
    "one issue that we will discuss in details in the article is the role of the quadratic interaction term , @xmath20 , which describes the self - interaction of the electronic polarization , and therefore contains the effects of the dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "most generally , the expression of the interaction should be written as a non - local expression , which takes into account the spatial dispersion of the electromagnetic response of the medium @xcite . however , as illustrated in figure [ fig1](a ) , in the systems that we study , the heterostructures embedded in the multilayered stack have a typical extension in the growth axis ( the @xmath10-axis ) that is much smaller than the wavelength .",
    "this justifies the local form of the interaction postulated in .",
    "we can evaluate the convenience of the dipole gauge already at the classical level , where the displacement field @xmath21 is determined only by the charges exterior to the system . on a quantum mechanical level , this means that @xmath15 describes a purely transverse field @xcite .",
    "therefore , neglecting the dissipation in the system , we can consider @xmath15 as a free photon field , independent from the electronic polarization of the heterostructures .",
    "this can be clearly observed , for instance , in the normal component of the displacement field @xmath22 , that , while it couples to the intersubband polarization , is continuous across the interfaces .",
    "we therefore consider the derivation of @xmath15 as a separate problem , which is dependent only on the particular arrangement of the multilayered stack . in this approach the resonant contribution of the electronic intersubband transitions taking place in the active media",
    "are contained separately in the polarization operator density @xmath23 , and are active only through the interaction term @xmath24 . later on ( section [ dielfuncsection ] )",
    "we shall see that this approach leads to an effective medium treatment of the system .    in our treatment",
    "the dissipation effects will be neglected .",
    "the latter can be taken into account as in the classical paper by huttner and barnet @xcite , by including a dissipative bath with continuous degrees of freedom .",
    "this approach will however require more precise definition of the displacement field @xmath25 , as it leads to a noise contribution from the dissipative bath @xcite . here",
    "we will restrict to a fully hamiltonian treatment .",
    "the dissipation will be taken into account only in a phenomenological way in section [ dielfuncsection ] , by adding a small imaginary part to the eigenfrequencies of the system @xcite .      , supporting guided modes .",

    "the function @xmath39 satisfies the helmholtz equation :    @xmath43    according to the boundary conditions for the electromagnetic field , @xmath44 and @xmath45 must be continuous at the interfaces between the different layers , and @xmath39 must vanish for @xmath46 .",
    "such a function has been illustrated in figure [ fig1](a ) .",

    "similar problem has been encountered in the attempts to define the static polarization in ferromagnetic materials as function of the electronic wavefunctions and nuclei distributions @xcite .",
    "then the idea is to define the polarization as the time integral of the microscopic current arising during the adiabatic switch from one configuration of electrons and nuclei to another .    in our case ,",
    "the microscopic current which corresponds to the intersubband transitions is a rapidly oscillating function at the frequencies of the transitions .",

    "combining these terms with the electronic hamiltonian we have :    @xmath165\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this quadratic hamiltonian can be diagonalized with the bogoliubov transformation @xcite , by introducing new bosonic operators @xmath166 which satisfy :    @xmath167=\\hbar \\widetilde{\\omega}_{\\alpha } p_{\\alpha \\mathbf{q}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath168 denotes the new eigenvalues .",
    "this diagonalization procedure yields the following results :    @xmath169    @xmath170    in equation the new eigenvalue @xmath168 is exactly the frequency of the collective mode of the bi - dimensional electron gas known as the `` intersubband plasmon '' @xcite . using and to express the remaining @xmath171 terms of @xmath144 we arrive at the full hamiltonian , which is now expressed in terms of the collective plasmonic operators :    @xmath172    here we have introduced the light - matter coupling constant in the dipole gauge :    @xmath173    the quantity @xmath174 is the plasmon - plasmon coupling constant :    @xmath175    where the coefficient @xmath176 is the plasmon - plasmon correlation coefficient , defined as :    @xmath177    the plasma hamiltonian described in equation is the central result of this paper .",
    "it provides a fully quantum description of the coupling between the light and the coherent collective intersubband modes of a bi - dimensional electron system .",
    "the hamiltonian contains both the interaction with the electromagnetic field and the coupling between plasmons from different subbands .",
    "the inter - plasmon coupling is contained in the coefficients @xmath176 . with the definition it appears simply as the normalized spatial overlap between the intersubband currents associated to the transitions @xmath151 and @xmath178 .",
    "this overlap vanishes when the subbands belong to spatially different quantum wells . on the contrary , @xmath176 takes values close to unity when the subbands originate from the same quantum well .",
    "the coefficients @xmath176 provide thus a convenient description for a number of cases , from spatially decoupled quantum wells ( tight - binding approximation ) , to strongly coupled heterostructures such as a superlattice .",
    "when several intersubband plasmons are present in the system , the bogoliubov procedure can be further applied to the inter - plasmon coupling terms of equation in order to obtain the new normal modes and their coupling with the light field .",
    "these results will be presented in a separate paper .",
    "we conclude this section by providing a very general expression of the light - matter coupling constant for an arbitrary shaped guided mode @xmath39 .",
    "to establish this expression we use the general form the @xmath10-component of the displacement field , instead of the special case of the @xmath26 mode .",
    "we then express the linear coupling term @xmath145 by following the same procedure as described in section [ sec_microdefp ] and the beginning of this section .",
    "this leads to the result :    @xmath179    here we have introduced the normalized current - light overlap coefficient :    @xmath180    and the angle @xmath181 is the propagation angle between the guided mode and the in - plane direction :    @xmath182    in the previous expression @xmath183 is the background dielectric constant of the media surrounding the current density @xmath184 .",
    "the expressions and reveal the striking resemblance between the plasmon - plasmon and the plasmon - light coupling constants , @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "indeed , the two coupling constants are proportional to a normalized overlap factor , respectively @xmath187 and @xmath188 ( equations and ) . in the same way as @xmath187 represents the overlap integral between the two currents arising from transition @xmath151 and @xmath178 , @xmath188 is the overlap between the current distribution @xmath151 and the electrical field profile of the optical mode @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , each plasmon enters the interaction with a weight factor @xmath189 .",
    "the weight of the light mode is @xmath190 , the cosine term expressing the selection rule for intersubband transitions @xcite .",
    "therefore , the interaction between the different plasmons , and the interaction with the light mode have the same form in the dipole gauge .",
    "indeed , the hamiltonian describes a set of coupled oscillators , one of which is the electromagnetic resonator , the other being the collective plasmon modes .",
    "this is schematized in in figure [ fig4 ] .        in most experimental situations",
    "the function @xmath39 varies slowly at the scale of the intersubband current density @xmath191 , and therefore can be taken out from the integral in equation . in this case",
    "we recover the usual expression for the oscillator strength @xmath192 @xcite using and .",
    "this leads to the expression , where instead of the definition we use a generalized filling factor of the form :    @xmath193    ( the definition for the @xmath26 mode is recovered by setting @xmath194 and @xmath195 ) .",
    "the dipole gauge provides therefore a very compact description of the interaction between the light and intersubband excitations .",
    "in particular , the simple structure of the coupling constants allows to disclose role played by the collective effect , described by the plasma frequencies @xmath155 and the microcavity geometry , which sets the overlap coefficients .",
    "finally , in this formulation , the weak coupling regime is naturally recovered for the case of vanishing plasmon - light overlap ( @xmath196 or @xmath197 ) , as expected .",
    "in this situation , which is common for absorption experiments , one measures solely the collective effects in the intersubband system contained in the matter part of the quantum hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "so far we used the expansion of the electromagnetic into the basis of guided modes labelled by the wavevector @xmath27 .",
    "our choice was motivated by the microscopic definition of the polarization density in section [ sec_microdefp ] , which is naturally expanded into elecronic plane waves propagating along the heterostucture slab ( see , for instance , ) .",
    "the approach developed here allows the rigorous quantum description of 0d microcavities that confine the electromagnetic field into all tree dimensions of space .",
    "such systems have been recently employed for the study of light - matter coupling with intersubband transitions @xcite . in this case",
    "the possible polarization excitations will be determined by the quantizing conditions for @xmath27 imposed by the microcavity boundaries .",
    "we start by expanding the electrical displacement into laterally localized @xmath26-like modes :    @xmath198    the index @xmath199 labels the discrete cavity modes and the set of functions @xmath200 describe the lateral shape of the modes .",
    "they are normalized such as :    @xmath201    we must now provide the expansion the polarization density into the new basis of localized electromagnetic modes . to this end , it is very convenient to use the quantum mechanical notations @xmath202 and @xmath203 so that @xmath204 and @xmath205",

    "details are provided in appendix [ apptransfo ] , and the final expression for the plasma hamiltonian of 0d microcavities is :    @xmath213    the above hamiltonian is formally similar to the plasma hamiltonian .",
    "the difference arises from the modified spectrum of electromagnetic modes , which is no longer continuum but discrete .",
    "the discrete spectrum allows to study the simplest possible light - matter interacting system , where only the lowest intersubband transition ( @xmath214 ) interacts resonantly with a single microcavity mode that is sufficiently far from the others , say the fundamental mode @xmath215 .",

    "that means that the charge distribution will vibrate into well defined spatial modes , imposed by the microcavity .",

    "usually , the case of a single intersubband transition coupled with a continuum of guided modes @xmath228 has been considered .",
    "these theoretical studies pointed out the possibility to obtain the `` ultra - strong '' coupling regime , where the light - matter coupling constant becomes comparable to the frequency of the intersubband transition @xmath229 @xcite .",
    "in this case the full quantum hamiltonian , including the anti - resonant terms and the quadratic vector potential term @xmath230 must be taken into account in order to describe correctly the system @xcite .    in this section",
    "we establish a link between the previous studies in the coulomb gauge and the description in the dipole gauge developed here .",
    "we shall consider the case of a single intersubband transition ( @xmath231 ) , coupled with the @xmath26 mode .",
    "we then perform a unitary transformation to the hamiltonian in order to obtain its expression in the coulomb gage .",

    "we return to the form of the hamiltonian with a single intersubband transition before the bogoliubov transformation leading to the depolarization shift :    @xmath233    ( the subscripts `` @xmath234 '' have been dropped for operators ) .",
    "the vector potential for the @xmath26 mode is :    @xmath235    we use to express the inverse pzw unitary transformation @xcite :    @xmath236    it writes in the case of a single intersubband transition :    @xmath237    recalling the parity of the photon dispersion @xmath238 the following transformation laws of the bosonic operators are obtained :    @xmath239    with these relations and their hermitian conjugates , the transformed hamiltonian is obtained to be :    @xmath240    here @xmath241 is the light - matter coupling constant in the minimal coupling gauge :    @xmath242    the first four terms of , together with provide the hopfield - like hamiltonian used so for the theoretical study of intersubband polaritons @xcite .",
    "namely , the presence of the @xmath243 term and the anti - resonant terms leads to the `` ultra - strong '' coupling regime @xcite .",
    "the later has been defined as the situation where the coupling term @xmath241 , taken at resonance @xmath244 becomes comparable with the energy of the intersubband transition @xmath229 :    @xmath245    since from and the @xmath243 term is proportional to square of the plasma frequency @xmath246 , we see that the ultra - strong coupling regime , as defined in ref . @xcite is obtained in systems featuring high photonic confinement factor @xmath247 , and high plasma frequency @xmath248 , i.e. high electronic densities",
    "however , for high electronic densities the coulomb interaction bring important dynamical corrections @xcite .",
    "the latter are already present in the dipole gauge , which naturally includes the collective excitations of the electron gas , as described in section [ sec_plasmah ] . in the hamiltonian",
    "expressed in the coulomb gauge , these correction actually arise from the last term . in appendix [ appcoulomb ]",
    "we show that this term can indeed be cast in a form of a long - wavelength limit of the coulomb potential .",
    "the coulomb correction in the hamiltonian contains an interesting new element , which is the geometrical prefactor @xmath249 .",
    "this prefactor is equal to one in the case of a very large cavity ( @xmath250 ) .",
    "this case of vanishing photon confinement corresponds , for instance , to the multi - pass waveguides employed for the absorption measurements where the depolarization shift is observed .",
    "however , the confinement factor @xmath251 becomes an important correction in the case of micro - cavities with filling factors @xmath247 close to unity , such as the double metal microcavities @xcite .",
    "we interpret the factor @xmath252 as an image contribution to the coulomb interaction due to the boundary conditions of the electric field at the microcavity walls .",
    "in other words , it can be seen as a local field correction due the partial screening of the microcavity field by the oscillating intersubband charges . indeed , both the displacement field @xmath253 and the polarization field @xmath254 that we used to construct the pzw hamiltonian satisfy the boundary conditions on the cavity walls , which are transported to the coulomb correction through the unitary transformation .",
    "note that the the unitary transformation holds only for a truncated hilbert space , where we retained only the first intersubband transition and the fundamental waveguide mode .",
    "the full gauge equivalence is established correctly only if the complete set of quantum transitions and electromagnetic modes of the system are accounted for @xcite .",
    "this issue will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "we can combine the last term in the hamiltonian with the first one , and perform a bogoliubov diagonalization just like in section [ sec_plasmah ] . as a result",

    "@xcite and @xcite , the effective hamiltonian includes also the correct limit of the weak coupling regime , obtained for vanishing overlap with the cavity mode @xmath250 . in this case from expression",
    "we recover the renormalized transition frequency @xmath263 , whereas the hamiltonians in refs . @xcite and @xcite would predict only the bare intersubband spacing @xmath229 .",
    "we now analyse coupled light - matter polariton states arising from the dipolar hamiltonian . to simplify , we ignore the coupling between plasmons on different subbands .",

    "the hamiltonian can be diagonalized exactly by introducing the polariton operator :    @xmath268    the hopfield coefficients introduced here satisfy the normalization condition :    @xmath269=\\hbar \\omega_\\mathbf{q } \\pi_\\mathbf{q}$ ] is then :    @xmath270    with @xmath271 the light - matter coupling constant from ( the subscript @xmath151 has been dropped ) .",

    "the impossibility for the light to propagate at the gap energies can be explained by the destructive interference between the microcavity electromagnetic field and the local field created by the collective electronic oscillations .",
    "the most important aspect of the strong - light matter coupling regime is the mixing between the electronic and photonic degrees of freedom .",
    "this mixing is quantified by the hopfield coefficients .",
    "namely , the coupled system features maximum mixing when the photonic part of the hopfield coefficients equals the electronic part : @xmath290 . from equation",
    "we readily obtain that this is satisfied when the cavity is tuned into resonance with the intersubband plasmon :    @xmath291    this has been illustrated in figure [ fig6](c ) . in the well known jaynes - cummings model @xcite the maximum mixing also corresponds to the point of minimal splitting @xmath292 between the two polariton states . however , this is not true in the general case .",
    "as shown in appendix [ apppropdisp ] , the minimum splitting occurs when the cavity is resonant with the lower gap edge frequency ( equation ):    @xmath293    this is also illustrated in figure [ fig6](b ) .",

    "more general result for an arbitrary cavity can be obtained with the expressions or .",
    "the quantity @xmath295 can therefore be used as an experimental measure of the interaction strength , even in the ultra - strong coupling regime .",
    "we see that both edges of the gap , @xmath297 and @xmath286 play an important role in the theory .",
    "the frequency @xmath286 defines the point of maximum quantum mixing , whereas @xmath297 defines the point of minimum splitting @xmath295 .",
    "however , we can observe from the plot on figure [ fig6](b ) that the splitting around the point @xmath298 is not very different from @xmath295 .",
    "this feature is a characteristic of the ultra - strong coupling regime , where we can no longer define a strict resonance condition for the optimal coupling point .",

    "this assumption is true for a sufficiently thin square quantum well . because both frequencies @xmath297 and @xmath286 increase with @xmath248 due to the depolarization effect , the system gets blue - shifted from the cavity mode , however the blue shift is much smaller for @xmath300 .",

    "the quantum self - energy is higher than the classical one , since the wavefunctions of the bound states illustrated in figure [ fig2 ] provide stronger spatial confinement of the charged particles .",
    "the plasma energy of the charged particles localized in a finite volume compensates for the energy decrease of the lower polariton as the light - matter coupling strength is increased .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig10 ] , where we have compared the polariton branches @xmath339 as a function of @xmath248 with the solution of equation when the depolarization shift is discarded , i.e. when @xmath168 is replaced with @xmath264 .",
    "the cavity is chosen so that @xmath340 , and the hartree corrections have been neglected for clarity .",
    "it is clearly seen that the depolarization effect prevents the lower polariton energy to reach zero , which is an equivalent statement of the no - go theorem for intersubband transitions .",
    "the dispersion relation allows to obtain the effective dielectric constant @xmath341 of the polaritonic medium .",
    "the latter can be defined through the propagation equation :    @xmath342    since for the @xmath26 mode @xmath343 , we obtain from :    @xmath344    note that the zero of the dielectric constant @xmath341 corresponds to the frequency of the intersubband plasmon @xmath286 , as expected .",
    "the above expression can be recast in the form :    @xmath345    where @xmath346 is the dielectric constant of the heterostructure alone :    @xmath347    the result is very similar to the effective dielectric constant obtained by zeluzny et nalewajko @xcite .",
    "this result arises naturally from the initial assumption that the heterostructure is much smaller than the wavelength of light .",
    "however , in our case the geometrical overlap factor @xmath348 contains a quantum correction due to the shape of the wavefunctions .",
    "the model developed so far is purely hamiltonian , and the dissipation has not been included .",
    "the dissipation can be introduced through a coupling with a reservoir of harmonic oscillators .",
    "such model has been considered , for instance , in refs .",
    "in particular , the method of ref .",
    "@xcite leads to a dielectric function of the form :    @xmath349    here @xmath350 is the linewidth of the intersubband plasmon modes , that can be determined in a phenomenological way , i.e. from absorption measurements @xcite .",
    "on the basis on the results from the previous section we can obtain an approximation for the dielectric constant , by replacing the effective plasma thickness @xmath351 with its maximum value @xmath352 ( see equation ) . we can call this substitution `` semiclassical approximation '' , since it leads to a plasma self - energy provided by the classical expression , as seen from equation .",
    "this leads to the widespread expression for the heterostructure dielectric constant @xcite :    @xmath353    in this limit , we obtain exactly the effective medium constant from ref.@xcite , since in this case the product @xmath348 is replaced with @xmath354 , which is independent from the particular intersubband transition . from section [ sec_nogo ]",
    "it is clear that the semiclassical approximation assumes that the intersubband polarization is constant inside the heterostructure slab , and zero everywhere else .",
    "including more than one transition in the definition of the dielectric constant is not not trivial , since one is obliged to diagonalize the full plasma hamiltonian taking into account the coupling between the different intersubband plasmons .",
    "the semiclassical approximation allows to write a simple analytical expression for the mutli - transition dielectric function :    @xmath355    this result is demonstrated in appendix [ appschplasma ] .",
    "in summary , we have provided a theoretical description of the light - matter interaction for the intersubband transitions in the electrical dipole gauge .",
    "we showed that , by introducing a microscopic expression for the intersubband polarization field @xmath19 , the power - zienau - woolley hamiltonian provides a suitable framework for the study of the interaction between the collective electronic excitations and light .",
    "this description is very general and applies to an arbitrary electronic potential , once the corresponding single particle wavefunctions are known .",
    "in particular , it can be used in the case of the ultra - strong coupling regime , in the limit of very high electronic densities and high overlap factors between the quantum well medium and the microcavity mode .",
    "the physical interpretation of the dipolar interaction hamiltonian is straightforward .",
    "the linear part of the hamiltonian , @xmath145 describes the coupling of the electronic excitations with the cavity electromagnetic field .",
    "the quadratic part , @xmath144 , contains the depolarization effect ( the effect of an oscillating current on itself ) and the coupling between plasmons from different transitions .",
    "the plasma energy described by the term @xmath144 leads to the no - go theorem for intersubband transitions .",
    "this energy has a close analogy the electromagnetic dipole self - energy of a two level system @xcite , that plays an important role for the estimation of the radiative corrections of atomic transitions @xcite .",
    "when the dipolar hamiltonian is transformed back in the coulomb gauge , it provides the coulomb interaction terms of the system including image charge effects arising from the boundary conditions on the cavity walls .",
    "this has been discussed for a truncated hamiltonian describing a single intersubband transition interacting with a @xmath26 mode of a double metal waveguide . in this case",
    "we find that the weights of the scalar potential @xmath2 and the @xmath306 term of the coulomb gauge version of the hamiltonian are governed by the geometrical overlap factor @xmath305 .",
    "our study completes the theoretical framework of the ultra - strong coupling , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , where only on the vector potential part @xmath306 was considered .",
    "we found that this study is justified for cavities with filling factors close to unity .",
    "a more general pzw back transformation , which uses the whole basis of guided modes and the full set of intersubband transitions will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "we believe that the approach developed here , based on operator formalism to describe the collective intersubband excitations , provides a compact and useful description that could allow further studies of quantum electro - dynamical effects inserted in solid state systems .",
    "the authors acknowledge very useful discussions with c. ciuti , d. hagenmuller and s. de liberato .",
    "we also acknowledge financial support from the erc grant `` adequate '' .",
    "in this appendix , we derive the vacuum normalization constant @xmath38 ( equation ) by taking into account the multilayered geometry of the guided mode stack",
    ". we also comment on the special treatment of metallic boundaries of the guiding structure .",
    "we start by expressing the volume integral as a function of the tm polarized field components ( 4)-(6 ) :    @xmath356    @xmath357    @xmath358    to derive these expressions we have used the parity of @xmath228 and @xmath38 as respect to @xmath27 and @xmath359 .",
    "we have also used the orthogonality of the two dimensional space harmonics @xmath360 .    to obtain the proper normalization of the electromagnetic field",
    ", we first show the following identity :    @xmath361}=0\\ ] ]    for the demonstration , we use the helmholtz equation .",
    "let us consider the @xmath9 layer , then by definition @xmath8 is constant .",
    "by multiplying the equation by @xmath44 and integrating across the @xmath9 layer we obtain :    @xmath362}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here we have also used that @xmath363 , and the symbol @xmath364 means the upper / lower side of the layer . using the boundary conditions of the electromagnetic field :    @xmath365    and the fact that @xmath366 we finally obtain :    @xmath367    where @xmath368 denote the upper / lower boundary of the multi - layer .",
    "either one or the two boundaries go to infinity ; then the field and its derivative go to zero .",
    "the other option is to take metallic boundaries .",
    "since in the mid- and far- infrared range the dielectric constant of the metals @xmath49 is very high , we can adopt perfect metal boundary conditions , where @xmath369 .",
    "we can then neglect the contribution of the field from the metallic layers in the integral . in all cases",
    "the identity is proven .",
    "thanks to this identity , the anti - resonant terms in the photon hamiltonian cancel , and the remaining term is simplified to :    @xmath370    following standard textbooks @xcite , the prefactor should correspond to the energy quantum of the guided mode @xmath371 , which leads to equation .",
    "although we used perfect metal boundary conditions for the normalization of the vacuum field amplitude @xmath372 , we can still describe the effects of the finite metal permittivity @xmath49 in our model . as an example , consider the current experimental situation where the multilayer is constituted by a surface plasmon waveguide , obtained by deposing a metal layer on a semiconductor substrate .",
    "we suppose the metal - semiconductor interface to be at @xmath373 . in the semiconductor",
    "the mode profile is described by an exponential function @xmath374 for @xmath375 , with @xmath376 the decay length of the surface plasmon mode into the semiconductor .",
    "let @xmath52 be the dielectric constant of the semiconductor , then we have @xcite :    @xmath377    using the above prescription , we consider the field in the metal to vanish , but we keep the expression of the finite dielectric function @xmath49 in the dispersion relations above .",
    "we then have @xmath378 , and the quantum amplitude of the surface plasmon mode becomes :    @xmath379    we see that in the far infrared domain , where @xmath380 and @xmath49 is very large and negative , both spontaneous emission and the strong coupling phenomena are unfavoured , since @xmath38 has vanishingly small values . on the contrary ,",
    "the photon electric amplitude @xmath38 can be enhanced in a microcavity resonator .",
    "we first write the linear part of the interaction hamiltonian by using the expressions , and the definition :    @xmath381\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since the function @xmath200 is real , we have @xmath382 , and therefore we can use the transformation law and its hermitian conjugate to obtain :    @xmath383    in order to transform the quadratic part we use the inverse transformations :    @xmath384    and therefore :    @xmath385    using once again the relation @xmath386 and the closure relation @xmath387 along with the orthogonality condition @xmath388 it is straightforward to transform the expression into :    @xmath389    we then use exactly the same bosonization approach as in section [ bright_and_dark ] to arrive at the hamiltonian .",
    "in order to show that the last term of equation has the form of the coulomb interaction , we first re - express it through the @xmath210-operators defined in section [ sec_microdefp ] :    @xmath390    we first use the vinter s indenity @xcite :    @xmath391    and we recognize the prefactor of to be exactly the long wavelength limit of the coulomb interaction matrix element @xmath392 :    @xmath393 , so we recover only the matrix elements that describe the interaction of electrons between subbands 1 and 2 , as should be expected .    next , using the fermionic commutation rules , we can easily rearrange the binary products of @xmath210-operators into four @xmath394-operator products :    @xmath395    @xmath396    @xmath397    @xmath398    note that the sum of the pair terms in and simply acts as the identity operator in the two subband subspace and therefore can be ignored .",

    "the final result can be interpreted as a dipole - dipole interaction , where the oscillating intersubband dipole moments interact with each other through their local field @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalue equation for the polariton problem is ( equation ):    @xmath402    for simplicity we have dropped the wavevector index @xmath27 .",
    "the real solution of equation are obtained from :    @xmath403    @xmath404    from these equations it is easy to deduce :    @xmath405    the minimal splitting is obtained from :    @xmath406    multiplying this equation by @xmath407 and using we obtain :    @xmath408    to transform this equation , we use the following relations :    @xmath409    the first is an immediate corollary from , while the second and the third are the newton formulas for equation .",
    "we then have :    @xmath410    to obtain the last line , we have derived equation with respect to @xmath411 .",
    "this equation clearly leads to the result :    @xmath412    furthermore , we can express the minimal splitting :    @xmath413    this is the result stated in equations and .",
    "in this appendix we consider the plasma hamiltonian in the semi - classical approximation discussed in the end of section [ dielfuncsection ] . it will be shown that this hamiltonian leads to the semi - classical dielectric constant .    in the semi - classical approximation",
    ", it is assumed that the intersubband polarization is constant along the heterostructure slab .",
