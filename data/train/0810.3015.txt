    "leptogenesis @xcite is one of the most attractive scenarios to explain the origin of the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe .",
    "it follows from the seesaw mechanism @xcite , which gives a natural and simple explanation to the small neutrino masses observed in neutrino experiments , and relies on the conversion of a lepton asymmetry to a baryon asymmetry thanks to the non - perturbative sphaleron processes @xcite . for a recent review on leptogenesis ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "if neutrinos are massive majorana particles , then lepton number must be violated . since neutrino masses are observed experimentally to be tiny , a slightly broken lepton number symmetry , e.g. a global @xmath4 , could provide the explanation . in this case ,",
    "small neutrino masses are not explained by a ` seesaw ' mechanism , but rather by a cancellation mechanism  @xcite .",
    "such a symmetry was introduced in the context of the @xmath5msm @xcite in @xcite to explain at the same time the kev scale of the dark matter sterile neutrino  @xcite and the quasi - degeneracy of the heavier two rh neutrinos , supposed to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe by means of leptogenesis via neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "the work  @xcite also made use of a slightly broken lepton symmetry to motivate large yukawa couplings with tev masses for the rh neutrinos , making them in principle accessible at the lhc .",
    "one consequence of the slightly broken @xmath4 symmetry is the existence of two quasi - degenerate rh neutrinos .",
    "this is interesting in the context of leptogenesis because it allows for an enhancement of the @xmath6 asymmetry parameter  @xcite , and hence successful leptogenesis is possible much below the usually quoted bounds on the mass scale and on the reheat temperature of the universe after inflation assuming hierarchical rh neutrinos , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the tension with the gravitino overproduction in msugra scenarios @xcite is thus relaxed .",
    "the second consequence of the broken symmetry is the presence of large washout parameters , implying that the asymmetry will be completely independent of the initial conditions , i.e. both the initial number of rh neutrinos and any previously generated asymmetry , even taking into account flavor effects  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study in detail the mechanism of leptogenesis in the presence of a slightly broken @xmath4 symmetry within the supersymmetric ( susy ) and non - supersymmetric two rh neutrino ( 2rhn ) model  @xcite .",
    "note that the 2rhn model is physically equivalent to the @xmath0 decoupling limit ( @xmath8 )  @xcite .",
    "a related study was performed in  @xcite with three quasi - degenerate rh neutrinos , which have to be motivated by a larger symmetry group , e.g. @xmath9 . there , the focus was to find numerical examples where resonant leptogenesis was possible with at the same time phenomenological consequences like observable lepton - flavor - violating signals in the non - susy setup . here",
    ", we introduce only a @xmath4 symmetry , and tackle the problem with only two rh neutrinos in both susy and non - susy cases .",
    "proceeding analytically , we keep under control the full parameter space of the problem , and we do not focus on resonant leptogenesis , which corresponds to the maximal possible enhancement of the @xmath6 asymmetry for quasi - degenerate heavy neutrinos .",
    "the 2rhn model implies one massless light neutrino and a reduction of the numbers of parameters compared to the model with three rh neutrinos from 18 to 11 , among which 7 ( 2 neutrino masses , 3 mixing angles and 2 @xmath6-violating phases ) are accessible in experiments . the lower number of parameters will allow us to have a perfect handle on the problem , and thus we will be able to derive an expression for the baryon asymmetry predicted by leptogenesis where the dependence on each parameter is simple .",
    "in particular , the high - energy parameters will factorize from the low - energy ones and from flavor effects altogether .",
    "this will make possible to study in detail the dependence of the predicted baryon asymmetry on the dirac and majorana @xmath6-violating phases as well as the unknown angle @xmath10 .",
    "note that , since the high - energy phase will be required to be non - zero for successful leptogenesis , leptogenesis from exclusively low - energy @xmath6 violation  @xcite is not viable here .",
    "finally , we will use the maximal enhancement of the @xmath6 asymmetry in the resonant limit  @xcite to obtain a constraint on one of the breaking parameters .",
    "interestingly , this constraint implies that successful leptogenesis is incompatible with the possible observation of rh neutrinos at future colliders  @xcite as well as sizable lepton - flavor - violating signals .",
    "this conclusion holds also in the susy case , if we assume the scale of leptogenesis to be below @xmath11  gev to avoid the gravitino problem .    in section 2",
    ", we introduce the parametrization of the 2rhn model which we will use throughout the paper . in section 3 , we describe how the lepton number symmetry affects the structure of the neutrino yukawa matrix and the majorana mass matrix .",
    "then , we discuss how to parametrize the small breaking of this symmetry . in section 4",
    ", we turn to leptogenesis , and estimate the baryon asymmetry predicted in this model with a special emphasis on the role of the pmns phases .",
    "we also constrain the size of the breaking parameters using the maximal enhancement of the @xmath6 asymmetry . in section 5 ,",
    "we extend the results to the supersymmetric version of the model .",
    "finally , we summarize our main results and conclude in section 6 .",
    "consider the seesaw model with two rh neutrinos . in the basis",
    "where the charged leptons and rh majorana neutrino mass matrices are both diagonal , the `` mass '' basis , the seesaw mass matrix is given by m_=-m_d m_m^-1m_d^t , where m_md_n = diag(m_1,m_2 ) .",
    "this matrix can be diagonalized as u^m_u^d_=diag(m_1,m_2,m_3 ) , where @xmath12 is the pmns matrix",
    ". we will adopt the parametrization  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and , neglecting statistical errors , we will use @xmath16 and @xmath17 , compatible with the results from neutrino oscillation experiments . moreover",
    ", we will adopt the @xmath18 range @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments measure two neutrino mass - squared differences , @xmath20 ev@xmath21 and @xmath22 ev@xmath21  @xcite .",
    "recall that with only two rh neutrinos the lightest active neutrino is massless .",
    "therefore , if the neutrino mass hierarchy is normal , one has @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , whereas if it is inverted , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "let us now introduce the so - called casas - ibarra parametrization @xcite @xmath29 the @xmath30 matrix is a @xmath31 matrix which can be parametrized as  @xcite @xmath32 in the normal and inverted hierarchy , respectively , and where @xmath33 is a complex parameter .",
    "@xmath34 is a discrete parameter that accounts for a discrete indeterminacy in @xmath35 .",
    "following  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) in the limit of only two rh neutrinos , we introduce a global @xmath4 lepton number symmetry for the leptonic fields , lepton doublets @xmath36 and right - handed neutrinos @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath4 charge assignments are as follows : @xmath38 the charges of all the other standard model fields are zero .",
    "note that we work in the basis where the mass matrix of the charged leptons is real and diagonal . from now on , we shall call the basis with @xmath39 the `` flavor '' basis . in this basis ,",

    ", the allowed structure of @xmath41 is given by @xmath43 without loss of generality , by using the field redefinition of @xmath44 , the non - zero components @xmath45 can be taken real and positive .    on the other hand , the allowed form of @xmath46 is @xmath47 where the mass parameter @xmath48 can be taken real and positive by field redefinitions of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "it should be noted that , when @xmath4 is exact , the masses of the active neutrinos are exactly zero .",
    "this is because lepton doublets carry non - zero charges , and hence a majorana mass term for them is forbidden .",
    "let us now consider the effects of @xmath4 symmetry breaking .",
    "such effects induce additional contributions to @xmath41 and @xmath46 : @xmath51 where @xmath52 are complex parameters with modulus of order one , @xmath53 is real and positive , @xmath54 is an arbitrary phase , and @xmath3 and @xmath55 are breaking parameters , which are supposed to be much smaller than one .",
    "note that we will not deal here with the issue of the @xmath4 breaking mechanism , and hence just parametrize the breaking parameters as given .",
    "we go now from the flavor basis to the mass basis for the rh neutrinos .",
    "the majorana mass matrix @xmath42 is symmetric , and therefore can be diagonalized using a unitary matrix @xmath56 : @xmath57 thus , the flavor eigenstates @xmath39 are related to the mass eigenstates @xmath58 by @xmath59_{ij } n_j$ ] .",
    "it is easy to show that , to first order in @xmath3 , the eigenvalues of @xmath42 are given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "so the degeneracy parameter @xmath62 is equal to the breaking parameter @xmath3 up to a factor @xmath63 supposed to be of order one . for simplicity",
    "we will assume in the remainder of the paper that @xmath64 .",
    "next , we turn to the neutrino yukawa matrix @xmath41 , which we want to express in the mass basis , i.e. @xmath65 . in a first approximation , we take @xmath66 , so that the mixing matrix of @xmath67 and @xmath68 is simply given by @xmath69 where the second matrix ensures that the two eigenvalues of the majorana mass matrix @xmath70 are positive . using the casas - ibarra parametrization eq .",

    "note that the dependence on @xmath180 in this expression is extremely mild , @xmath181 .",
    "the extension of the results presented in the last section is then straightforward . from the maximal enhancement of the @xmath6 asymmetry in the degenerate limit [ cf .",
    "( [ condres ] ) ] , we obtain slightly modified bounds on the breaking parameters , @xmath182 in the case of normal hierarchy , and @xmath183 in the case of inverted hierarchy",
    ".    since the limits on the breaking parameters are very similar to the non - susy case , the active - sterile mixing angles are necessarily small here as well .",
    "hence , the conclusion about the incompatibility of leptogenesis with the observation of rh neutrinos at colliders is still valid . in the case of lepton - flavor violation ,",
    "the discussion is somewhat different since new diagrams contribute that are not suppressed by the small mixing between active and sterile neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "for example , the rate of @xmath184 will actually depend on the combination @xmath185 .",
    "however , for the range of rh neutrino masses we are interested in to avoid the gravitino problem , i.e. @xmath186  gev , the yukawa couplings are too small ( @xmath187 ) to give an observable signal .",
    "we have studied the mechanism of leptogenesis in the presence of a slightly broken lepton number symmetry .",
    "two almost degenerate right - handed neutrinos result from the symmetry , with the small breaking parameter @xmath3 essentially describing the mass splitting , and @xmath55 fixing the size of the ( inverse of the ) washout .",
    "two well - known consequences follow : first , the scale of leptogenesis can be as low as the electroweak scale .",
    "second , the baryon asymmetry predicted through leptogenesis is independent of the initial conditions , i.e. both the initial number of rh neutrinos and any previously generated asymmetry .    with only two heavy neutrinos , which is equivalent to the @xmath0 decoupling limit",
    ", the model contains few unknown parameters in addition to the two breaking parameters : one rh neutrino mass , one ` high - energy ' phase , the angle @xmath10 and two @xmath6-violating phases in the pmns matrix .",
    "the relatively low number of parameters has allowed us to have a perfect handle on the problem , and we have been able to obtain semi - analytical formulae for the final asymmetry , eqs .",
    "( [ resultanal ] ) and ( [ resultanalsusy ] ) in the non - susy and susy case , respectively , which disclose a simple dependence on each one of these parameters . in particular , we have studied in detail the role of the pmns phases and @xmath10 ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : correlnormal ] and [ fig : correlinverted ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the high - energy phase is required to be non - zero for successful leptogenesis , implying that leptogenesis from exclusively low - energy @xmath6-violation is not viable in this context .    finally , we derived from successful leptogenesis and the maximal enhancement of the @xmath6 asymmetry in the resonant limit that the breaking parameter @xmath55 must be relatively large , @xmath188 for normal and @xmath2 for inverted hierarchy ( both in susy and non - susy cases ) . as a consequence ,",
    "leptogenesis is not compatible with the observation of rh neutrinos at future colliders and with a sizable lepton - flavor violation signal .",
    "the other breaking parameter , @xmath3 , can be much smaller , and actually needs to be so in order to have low - scale leptogenesis .",
