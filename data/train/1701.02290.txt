    "statistical model calculations are widely used for the calculation of reaction cross sections of @xmath0-induced reactions for intermediate mass and heavy target nuclei .",
    "it is found that the cross sections at low energies depend sensitively on the chosen @xmath0-nucleus optical model potential .",
    "these low - energy cross sections play also an essential role under stellar conditions .",
    "in particular , ( @xmath3,@xmath0 )  photodisintegration reactions in the so - called astrophysical p - process  ( or @xmath3-process ) are best determined by the study of the inverse ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  capture reactions @xcite . under typical p - process  conditions , temperatures of about @xmath8 billion kelvin are reached ( in short : @xmath9 ) , and the corresponding gamow window is located at a few mev for intermediate mass nuclei like @xmath1zn  ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    the lightest nucleus which is synthesized in the p - process , is @xmath10se @xcite .",
    "these so - called p nuclei are typically characterized by very low natural abundances of the order of 1% or even below .",
    "although @xmath1zn  is somewhat lighter than the lightest p nucleus , it has nevertheless been chosen for the present study because the cross sections of various @xmath0-induced reactions can be determined for @xmath1zn  by the simple and robust activation technique with high precision .",
    "the high natural abundance of @xmath1zn  of almost 50% allows to use targets with natural isotopic composition .",
    "however , there is also a drawback . for lighter nuclei like @xmath1zn  the applicability of the statistical model",
    "may be limited at very low energies because of an insufficient level density in the @xmath11ge  compound nucleus .",
    "our recent study of @xmath0-induced reaction cross sections for the target nucleus @xmath1zn  @xcite was focused on total reaction cross sections @xmath12  and its determination from either elastic scattering angular distributions or from the sum over the cross sections of all open non - elastic channels ( including inelastic scattering ) .",
    "it was found that there is excellent agreement at the lower energy of 12.1mev ( @xmath13 mb from elastic scattering vs.  @xmath14 mb from the sum over non - elastic channels ) . at the higher energy of 16.1mev a significant contribution of compound - inelastic ( @xmath0,@xmath15 )  scattering to higher - lying states in @xmath1zn  was identified which is about @xmath16% of @xmath12@xmath17 mb from elastic scattering .",
    "the present study extends our previous work @xcite by a detailed study of the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 ) , ( @xmath0,n ) , ( @xmath0,p ) , and total reaction cross sections and their dependence on the underlying parameters of the statistical model ( stm ) calculations . for this purpose the full parameter space of the widely used talys @xcite code ( version 1.8 )",
    "was investigated .",
    "in particular , all available options for the @xmath0-nucleus optical model potential ( a - omp ) , the nucleon omp ( n - omp ) , the @xmath3-ray strength function ( gsf ) , and the level density ( ld ) were varied .",
    "almost 7,000 combinations of input parameters are used to calculate a @xmath2 landscape .",
    "this landscape provides improved insight into the sensitivities of the different reaction channels on the underlying parameters .",
    "it is the scope of the present study to obtain an improved @xmath2-based prediction of reaction cross sections at very low energies where experimental data are not available . as an example",
    ", an extrapolation to the astrophysically most relevant energies is made for the @xmath1zn(@xmath0,@xmath3)@xmath11ge  reaction with an estimate of the corresponding uncertainties .",
    "the most important ingredient for the calculation of @xmath0-induced reaction cross sections in the stm is the a - omp . for heavy nuclei ( above @xmath18 )",
    "it has been found that different a - omps lead to dramatic variations of the predicted cross sections , exceeding one order of magnitude at astrophysically relevant energies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "contrary , a quite reasonable description of the recent data for @xmath1zn  was found for several a - omps @xcite .",
    "however , as will be shown below from a @xmath2-based assessment , this reasonable description for @xmath1zn  is still far from a precise prediction of the experimental results .",

    "in a schematic notation the reaction cross section in the stm is proportional to @xmath19 with the transmission coefficients @xmath20 into the @xmath21-th open channel and the branching ratio @xmath22 for the decay into the channel @xmath23 .",
    "the total transmission is given by the sum over all contributing channels : @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath20 are calculated from global optical potentials ( a - omp and n - omp for the particle channels ) and from the gsf for the photon channel .",
    "the @xmath20 include contributions of all final states @xmath25 in the respective residual nucleus in the @xmath21-th exit channel . in practice ,",
    "the sum over all final states @xmath25 is approximated by the sum over low - lying excited states up to a certain excitation energy @xmath26 ( these levels are typically known from experiment ) plus an integration over a theoretical level density for the contribution of higher - lying excited states : @xmath27 for further details of the definition of @xmath20 , see @xcite .",
    "@xmath28 refers to the entrance channel where the target nucleus is in its ground state under laboratory conditions .",
    "the calculation of stellar reaction rates @xmath29@xmath30  requires further modifications of eq .",
    "( [ eq : stm ] ) which have to take into account thermal excitations of the target nucleus @xcite .",
    "for the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  reaction of the even - even nucleus @xmath1zn  with the relatively high excitation energy of the first excited state ( @xmath31 , @xmath32kev ) , these corrections remain small at typical temperatures of the p - process  of the order of a few billion kelvin @xcite .",
    "the properties of the @xmath20 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : stm ] ) and ( [ eq : tsum ] ) lead to the following general findings for the case of @xmath1zn . at very low energies , the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )",
    "channel with its positive @xmath33-value of @xmath34mev is the only open reaction channel besides elastic and inelastic scattering .",
    "the transmission @xmath35 into the @xmath3-channel exceeds the transmission @xmath36 into the @xmath0-channel which is strongly suppressed by the coulomb barrier .",
    "consequently , @xmath37 , and the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  cross section becomes proportional to @xmath28 , but almost independent of the other @xmath20 ( including @xmath35 ) .",
    "as soon as the proton channel opens ( @xmath38mev ) , @xmath39 increases almost exponentially with energy and exceeds @xmath35 already close above the proton threshold . because of the lower coulomb barrier for the proton channel ( compared to the @xmath0  case )",
    ", @xmath39 becomes the dominant contributor to the sum in @xmath40 .",
    "this leads to a ( @xmath0,p )  cross section proportional to @xmath28 but independent of the other @xmath20 ( including @xmath39 ) .",
    "the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  cross section becomes approximately proportional to @xmath41 .    because of the strongly negative @xmath33-value of the ( @xmath0,n )  channel ( @xmath42mev ) and the resulting smaller phase space ( in comparison to the ( @xmath0,p )  reaction )",
    ", the contribution of the ( @xmath0,n )  channel remains relatively small .",
    "this finding is different from heavy nuclei where the ( @xmath0,n )  channel typically becomes dominant close above the neutron threshold ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "now we find the approximate proportionalities of @xmath43 for the ( @xmath0,p )  cross section , @xmath44 for the ( @xmath0,n )  cross section , and @xmath45 for the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  cross section .",
    "although the above discussion is indeed somewhat simplistic , it is nevertheless helpful for a general understanding of the sensitivities of the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 ) , ( @xmath0,n ) , and ( @xmath0,p )  cross sections on the underlying parameters .",
    "sensitivities as a function of energy have been calculated by rauscher @xcite for a wide range of nuclei ; the results from the non - smoker code are available online at @xcite and confirm the above discussion for @xmath1zn .",
    "the role of the level density requires further discussion . as eq .",
    "( [ eq : tsum ] ) shows , the chosen parametrization of the ld becomes only relevant above a certain number of low - lying excited states which are taken into account explicitly .",
    "typically , these low - lying levels cover an excitation energy range of @xmath46mev .",
    "thus , for @xmath0-induced reactions on @xmath1zn  this means that the importance of the lds remains limited , in particular at low energies , for the ( @xmath0,n )  and ( @xmath0,p )  reactions whereas the role of the ld is significant for the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  reaction ; here the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tsum ] ) does contribute .",
    "however , besides its relatively minor role for the calculation of the transmissions @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tsum ] ) , the ld plays an essential role for the applicability of the stm which is only valid if the experimental conditions ( mainly target thickness and energy distribution of the beam ) average over a sufficient number of levels in the compound nucleus @xmath11ge . for the present data the energy interval @xmath47 of the experiment is of the order of 100kev @xcite .",
    "the experimental energies cover an energy range of about 6mev @xmath48 15mev .",
    "together with the @xmath33-value of the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  reaction of about @xmath49mev , this corresponds to excitation energies @xmath50 in @xmath11ge  of about 10mev @xmath51mev .",
    "the various options for the ld in talys ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : ld ] ) predict total level densities ( per parity ) between about 9000mev@xmath52 and 80000mev@xmath52 already at the lowest energies under study . at first view",
    ", this seems to be sufficient for the applicability of the stm .",
    "but in particular for the ( @xmath0,p )  reaction close above the threshold , the experimental excitation curve is not completely smooth ( as expected for a fully statistical behavior ) .",
    "close above the threshold , the @xmath1zn(@xmath0,p)@xmath53ga  reaction populates only very few final states in @xmath53ga  with low spins @xmath54 and negative parity .",
    "the barrier penetration in this exit channel favors proton emission with low angular momentum , and thus by far not all levels in the @xmath11ge  compound nucleus contribute to the @xmath1zn(@xmath0,p)@xmath53ga  cross section",
    ". a closer look at the level densities in @xmath11ge  shows that the predicted level density per spin goes down to e.g.  about a few hundred per mev for @xmath55 , or less than 100 levels may contribute to the averaging within the experimental energy interval of @xmath56kev .",
    "thus , non - statistical fluctuations in the excitation function of @xmath1zn(@xmath0,p)@xmath53ga  at low energies are not very surprising .",
    "lds increase dramatically with increasing excitation energy . at the highest energies under study , the predicted level densities are at least two orders of magnitude higher than at the lowest energies . and",
    "indeed the non - statistical fluctuations in the excitation function of @xmath1zn(@xmath0,p)@xmath53ga  disappear at energies above 10mev ( corresponding to @xmath57mev in @xmath11ge  or an increase of the level density by more than one order of magnitude , compared to @xmath58mev ) .",
    "the @xmath0-nucleus optical model potential is the essential ingredient for the calculation of @xmath0-induced reaction cross sections at low energies .",
    "talys provides 8 options for the a - omp : the first option is based on the early work of watanabe @xcite ; this was the default option in talys .",
    "the widely used simple 4-parameter potential by mcfadden and satchler @xcite is the second option in talys .",

    "_  @xcite ( avr for the latest version in @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the new atomki - v1 potential @xcite was implemented into the talys code , and modifications of the third version of the demetriou potential dgg-3 were investigated .",
    "it was recently suggested in @xcite that the real part of this potential should be multiplied by a factor of about @xmath59  @xmath60 for a better description of reaction data for heavy targets ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "for @xmath1zn it will be shown that the best fit is achieved by a reduction of the real part by a factor of about 0.9 ( instead of an increased potential as found for @xmath61 in @xcite ) .",
    "the latest global a - omp by su and han @xcite is not yet implemented in talys .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that this potential overestimates the total reaction cross sections for @xmath1zn  at low energies .",
    "thus , no efforts have been made to implement this potential into talys for the present study .",
    "the default option in talys is based on the local and global parametrizations in koning and delaroche @xcite .",
    "furthermore , based on the work of jeukenne , lejeune , and mahaux ( e.g. , @xcite ) , four different versions of the so - called jlm potential are available .",
    "the basic jlm - type potential is taken from bauge _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and three modifications of this potential are taken from goriely and delaroche @xcite .",
    "eight different options for the @xmath3-ray strength function are implemented in talys . in general , the options are based on the work of brink @xcite and axel @xcite or kopecky and uhl @xcite .",
    "in addition , microscopic model gsfs have been calculated on the basis of hartree - fock bcs , hartree - fock - bogolyubov , relativistic mean field models @xcite , and a hybrid model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the above choices can be combined with two options for the m1 strength function where the m1 strength is either normalized to the e1 strength ( default option ) or not normalized .",
    "a detailed description of the available options can be found in the talys manual @xcite and in the reference input parameter library ( ripl ) @xcite .",
    "three phenomenological and three miscroscopic level densities can be chosen in talys .",
    "the phenomenological options are based on constant temperature and back - shifted fermi gas models and on the generalized superfluid model .",
    "the microscopic approaches are calculated using skyrme or gogny type forces .",
    "details on the various options are summarized in @xcite .",
    "several excitation functions of @xmath0-induced reaction cross sections for @xmath1zn  are available in literature and in the exfor database @xcite .",

    "[ fig : reac_all ] nicely shows that the overall energy dependence of the various reaction channels is well reproduced by the best - fit statistical model calculation .",
    "the only exceptions are the ( @xmath0,3n )  reaction where the only available experimental data set of porile @xcite is more than one order of magnitude above the theoretical estimate , and the ( @xmath0,2n )  reaction which is underestimated by about a factor of 4 .",
    "furthermore , the importance of the various reaction channels at different energies can nicely be read from fig .",
    "[ fig : reac_all ] . at very low energies below about 6mev the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )",
    "reaction is dominating because the ( @xmath0,p )  and ( @xmath0,n )  channels are closed or suppressed by the coulomb barrier of the outgoing low - energy proton . at about 6mev",
    "the ( @xmath0,p )  reaction starts to dominate up to almost 20mev .",
    "as soon as the ( @xmath0,n )  channel opens , also a significant contribution of the ( @xmath0,n )  channel is found . above 20mev , various multi - particle emission channels like ( @xmath0,pn ) , ( @xmath0,2n ) , and ( @xmath0,@xmath0n )  contribute also to the total reaction cross section @xmath12 .",
    "as the focus of the present study is the low - energy region , we finally decided to use only our latest data of the @xmath0-induced cross sections for @xmath1zn  for the determination of the best - fit parameters for the statistical model calculations at low energies .",
    "in particular , this means 4 data points for the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  reaction , 10 data points for the ( @xmath0,n )  reaction , 27 data points for the ( @xmath0,p )  reaction , and 2 data points for the total reaction cross section @xmath12  from the analysis of the elastic scattering angular distributions @xcite ; in total , 43 experimental data points are used to determine the @xmath2 landscape . the @xmath2 adjustment procedure will be discussed in detail in the following section .",
    "all combinations of the a - omps , n - omps , gsfs , and ld parametrizations in sect .",

    "this means that 6720 combinations of a - omps , n - omps , gsfs , and lds have been calculated .",
    "this number results from 14 a - omps ( 8 built - in in talys plus atomki - v1 plus dgg-3 multiplied by factors of @xmath59  @xmath62 , 0.8 , 0.9 , 1.1 , and 1.2 ) , 8 e1 gsfs combined with two additional options for the m1 strength , 5 n - omps , and 6 lds .",
    "technically it would be possible to further increase this number by choosing different models for each residual nucleus , e.g.  different n - omps for the neutron and the proton channel or different gsfs or lds for even and odd residual nuclei , etc .",
    "however , best - fit parameters should be valid for a reasonable range of nuclei , and thus the present work intentionally remained restricted to the above listed 6720 combinations of a - omps , n - omps , gsfs , and lds , and did not apply different parameter sets for different residual nuclei of the @xmath0  + @xmath1zn  reactions .    for each of the 6720 combinations of parameters , excitation functions for the total reaction cross section @xmath12  and",

    "one main task in nuclear astrophysics is the determination of reaction rates @xmath29@xmath30  which are essentially defined by the cross sections at low energies . in the present study we aim to use the above @xmath7 calculations to constrain the @xmath1zn(@xmath0,@xmath3)@xmath11ge  cross section for energies below the experimental data . before this can be done in the next sect .",
    "[ sec : extra ] , the results of the previous sect .",
    "[ sec : res ] with @xmath79 have to be discussed in more detail .    for the following discussion let us first assume that the statistical model is valid for @xmath1zn  + @xmath0 , and at least one hypothetical and a priori unknown combination of the almost 7000 combinations of input parameters is able to reproduce the experimental cross sections . under these assumptions one should find that this hypothetical best - fit combination reproduces the experimental data with @xmath80 . for dominating statistical uncertainties of the experimental data ,",
    "@xmath81 should be found . for dominating systematic uncertainties , even cases with @xmath82",
    "may be found .",
    "typical systematic uncertainties from charge integration , target thickness , or detector efficiency affect all data points in the same way ( except @xmath12  from elastic scattering ) .",
    "thus , for dominating systematic uncertainties , a variation of the absolute normalization of the experimental data within their common systematic uncertainty should lead to an almost perfect agreement between the hypothetical best - fit combination and the normalized experimental data with @xmath82 .    in reality , the experimental data points are affected by both , statistical and systematic , uncertainties . for most of the data points , the systematic uncertainty is dominating ; only for the weak ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  channel and for low energies or energies close above the respective thresholds , the statistical uncertainty is dominating @xcite .",
    "thus , we have varied the absolute normalization @xmath83 of the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 ) , ( @xmath0,n ) , and ( @xmath0,p )  cross sections within a range of @xmath84 which corresponds to about 3 times the systematic uncertainty of the data of about 10% @xcite .",
    "a smooth variation of the @xmath7 with the normalization factor @xmath83 was found with a minimum of @xmath85 for @xmath86 , compared to @xmath87 for the original data ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "consequently , among the almost 7000 combinations of parameters for the stm calculations , there is no combination with @xmath82 , i.e. , none of the almost 7000 combinations is able to reproduce the experimental data .    strictly speaking",
    ", this means that either all almost 7000 combinations of input parameters are incompatible with the experimental results , or the chosen stm is inappropriate for the present case .",
    "however , neither a better model is available for the calculation of the @xmath1zn  + @xmath0  reaction cross sections , nor better parameterizations of the ingredients of the stm are available ; this holds in particular for the a - omps under study which govern the theoretical uncertainties of the calculated low - energy cross sections",
    ". nevertheless , low - energy cross sections have to be calculated , and their uncertainties have to be estimated , to provide an astrophysical reaction rate @xmath29@xmath30  with a reasonable error bar .",
    "therefore , the following considerations were used to obtain a realistic constraint for the low - energy ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  cross section .    for dominating statistical uncertainties of the experimental data under study , the uncertainty of a fit parameter",
    "is calculated from the increase of @xmath2 by 1 .",
    "contrary , a dominating systematic uncertainty leads to a larger uncertainty for fit parameters because systematic uncertainties from many data points do on average not cancel each other .",
    "thus , an increase of @xmath2 for each data point by 1 should be used in the latter case ; i.e. , an increase of @xmath7 by 1 indicates the uncertainty of a fit parameter in the case of dominating systematic uncertainties .",
    "however , both above criteria for @xmath2 for statistical uncertainties and for @xmath7 for systematic uncertainties are only robust if @xmath80 is achieved ; but this was not possible in the present study of @xmath0-induced reaction cross sections of @xmath1zn .",
    "consequently , the available experimental data for @xmath1zn  can not provide a strict mathematical constraint for ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  cross section at lower energies .    a reasonable criterion for the allowed range of @xmath7 has to be chosen to find a rather reliable constraint of the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  cross section at low energies .",
    "it should be pointed out here that this is not a new problem of the present study .",
    "the problem becomes only very obvious here because we attempt to provide a @xmath2-based constraint of the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  cross section at low energies .",
    "in many previous papers the best combination of parameters was simply derived `` by eye '' from the comparison of experimental excitation functions with theoretical predictions using a more or less broad range of input parameters and/or computer codes for the stm .",
    "then , often this best combination is simply used to calculate astrophysical reaction rates ( without further discussion of @xmath2 ) .    following the above discussion",
    ", we have decided to use the following criterion for the allowed variation of @xmath2 .",
    "the best - fit combination of parameters reaches @xmath6 , corresponding to an average deviation of about 30% from the experimental data . for experimental uncertainties of the order of 10% ,",
    "this means that we find an average deviation of almost @xmath89 . for the uncertainty determination of the low - energy ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  data",
    ", we now accept all combinations of parameters with @xmath90 .",
    "this corresponds to an average @xmath91 deviation instead of the best - fit @xmath92 deviation ; i.e. , we allow for an increase of the average deviation of each data point by @xmath93 , and the resulting parameter space should describe the data with average deviations of less than about 40% .      in the following we restrict ourselves here to estimate the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  cross section at two energies below the lowest experimental point at about 8mev .",
    "the first energy is chosen from the most effective energy at @xmath94 , i.e.  a temperature of @xmath95k which is typical for the astrophysical p - process . from the standard formulae which are based on an energy - independent astrophysical s - factor ,",
    "the most effective energy at this temperature is @xmath96mev . in practice ,",
    "the assumption of a constant s - factor  is not realistic for heavy nuclei , and in most cases the effective energy is slightly shifted towards lower energies @xcite .",
    "the second energy is taken as @xmath97mev which is slightly below the ( @xmath0,p )  threshold and far below the ( @xmath0,n )  threshold . at this low energy the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )",
    "cross section depends almost exclusively on the chosen a - omp .    for the almost 7000 combinations of parameters , the calculated ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  cross sections at 5.36mev vary between 2.5@xmath98b and 85@xmath98b .",
    "[ fig : chi2]a ) shows that the corresponding @xmath7 vary between about 8 and almost 5000 .",
    "the inset shows the calculations with @xmath99 . here",
    "it becomes clearly visible that the @xmath7 are grouped according to the chosen a - omp ; e.g. , the dgg-3 potential ( with @xmath59  @xmath100 , i.e.  without further adjustment of the depth of the real part ) favors ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  cross sections between 4.9 and 6.5@xmath98b ( with smallest @xmath7 for @xmath101@xmath98b ) , and the avr potential favors cross sections between 8.7@xmath98b and 13.8@xmath98b ( with smallest @xmath7 for @xmath102@xmath98b ) . adopting the above criterion of @xmath90 , we find @xmath103 at @xmath104mev .",
    "thus , the chosen criterion @xmath90 restricts the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  cross section to @xmath105@xmath98b with an uncertainty of a factor of two , whereas the range of all calculations was between 2.5@xmath98b and 85@xmath98b .",
    "the same procedure is repeated for the lower energy of 3.95mev ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : chi2 ] , upper part b ) . here",
    "the predictions vary between 2.3nb and 192nb , i.e.  the predictions cover almost two orders of magnitude . applying the criterion @xmath90 restricts the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  cross section to @xmath106 at @xmath97mev , i.e.  the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  cross section is @xmath107nb , again with an uncertainty of about a factor of two .",
    "combinations of parameters which lead to much higher cross sections , are excluded by the chosen @xmath2 criterion .",
    "as expected , the calculated cross section of the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  reaction depends almost exclusively on the a - omp at the lower energy of 3.95mev .",
    "this is reflected by the strictly vertical grouping of the different a - omps in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2]b ) . at the slightly higher energy of 5.36mev , a grouping according to the a - omps is also observed .",
    "however , because the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  cross section is not only sensitive to the a - omp , but also to other parameters , the grouping is not strictly vertical here , see fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2]a ) .",
    "finally , it is interesting to see that the few - parameter atomki - v1 potential is only able to reach @xmath108 , but nevertheless it is able to predict the low - energy ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  cross sections reasonably well . at the higher energy of 5.36mev the atomki - v1 potential predicts ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  cross sections between 9.3@xmath98b and 13.5@xmath98b , and at the lower energy of 3.95mev the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  cross section from atomki - v1 is 5.1nb .",
    "excitation functions of the cross sections of the @xmath1zn(@xmath0,@xmath3)@xmath11ge , @xmath1zn(@xmath0,n)@xmath53ge , and @xmath1zn(@xmath0,p)@xmath53ga  reactions and the total reaction cross section @xmath12  have been analyzed using the statistical model and a @xmath2-based assessment of the underlying parameters .",
    "a best fit to the experimental data at low energies @xcite shows @xmath109 and an average deviation factor of about @xmath63  @xmath65 from all experimental data .",
    "the complete parameter space of the talys code was investigated using almost 7000 combinations of the @xmath0-nucleus omps , nucleon - nucleus omps , gamma - ray strength functions , and level densities . as the most important ingredient of these stm calculations , the @xmath0-nucleus potential was identified .",
    "this fact can be derived from the behavior of the @xmath7 .",
    "the best - fit is obtained by a modification of the third version of the demetriou _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite potential where the real part is scaled by a factor of @xmath59  @xmath110 .",
    "this best - fit result is still far from @xmath111 .",
    "a reduction of @xmath2 should be achievable from further improvements of the @xmath0-nucleus omp at low energies .",
    "@xmath112 will probably not be reachable because of non - statistical fluctuations of the reaction cross sections , in particular for the @xmath1zn(@xmath0,p)@xmath53ga  reaction at low energies .    from the range of @xmath7 and the corresponding variation of the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  cross section at lower energies , an uncertainty of about a factor of two",
    "is estimated for the astrophysical reaction rate of the @xmath1zn(@xmath0,@xmath3)@xmath11ge  reaction and its cross section at very low energies .",
    "the uncertainty results from all reasonable fits with @xmath90 and their extrapolations down towards astrophysically relevant energies where no experimental data for the @xmath1zn(@xmath0,@xmath3)@xmath11ge  reaction are available .",
    "improved ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  data at lower energies could reduce the uncertainty of the ( @xmath0,@xmath3 )  reaction rate and help to further constrain the parameters for the statistical model calculations .",
