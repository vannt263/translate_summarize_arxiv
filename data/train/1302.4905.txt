    "two neutrino double beta ( @xmath3 ) decay is the rarest nuclear transformation ever observed ; the half - lives are in the range of @xmath4@xmath5 yr ( see e.g. @xcite ) . as regards the neutrinoless mode ( @xmath6 ) of the decay , a particular analysis of the data collected by the heidelberg - moscow collaboration , exploiting the @xmath7ge isotope , was presented in @xcite ; several experiments are now in progress on the same and on other isotopes to further investigate the process",
    ". published limits on the half - life of this process in various isotopes are at level of @xmath8@xmath9 yr ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "investigations of the @xmath10 decay are related with several fundamental topics of particle physics : the lepton number violation , the nature of neutrino ( majorana or dirac particle ) , an absolute scale of neutrino mass and the neutrino mass hierarchy ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of the most sensitive 2@xmath11 experiments was realized in the solotvina underground laboratory ( ukraine ) with the help of @xmath12 kg radiopure cadmium tungstate scintillators enriched in @xmath1cd ( @xmath1cdwo@xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "cdwo@xmath2 crystal scintillators were also successfully used to search for @xmath13 processes in @xmath0cd @xcite and @xmath14cd @xcite .",
    "the experiments showed that cdwo@xmath2 scintillator is a promising detector thanks to possibility to realize calorimetric `` source = detector '' experiment with a high detection efficiency , low level of intrinsic radioactivity , good scintillation properties , ability of pulse - shape discrimination in order to suppress background caused by intrinsic radioactive contamination , and long operation stability .",
    "in addition , @xmath1cd and @xmath0cd isotopes are favorable candidates for 2@xmath11 experiments thanks to the high energy of decay ( @xmath15 mev @xcite ) , promising theoretical estimations ( e.g. see in @xcite ) , relatively large isotopic abundance @xcite and possibility of enrichment by ultra - centrifugation @xcite .",
    "high quality @xmath0cdwo@xmath2 crystal scintillator enriched in @xmath0cd was developed for the first time @xcite .",
    "large volume @xmath1cdwo@xmath2 crystal was produced to investigate 2@xmath11 decay of @xmath1cd @xcite .",
    "experiments with these detectors @xcite demonstrate their high scintillation quality and low level of radioactive contamination .",
    "nevertheless , taking into account that high sensitivity @xmath13 experiments require very low , ideally zero , background , an r&d to further improve the radiopurity of the scintillators by recrystallization is in progress .",
    "some preliminary results of this work are presented here .",
    "to develop crystal scintillators from enriched material , one needs to minimize loss of costly isotopically enriched materials , maximize yield of crystal scintillators , prevent radioactive contamination . taking into account these demands ,",
    "the production of the enriched @xmath0cdwo@xmath2 and @xmath1cdwo@xmath2 crystals has been performed in the following steps : a ) purification of the isotopically enriched cadmium metal samples by means of heating with filtering and subsequent distillation through getter filter ; b ) chemical purification and synthesis of cadmium tungstate compounds ; c ) crystal growth ; d ) cut to produce scintillation element(s ) .",
    "the purity grade of all the materials was controlled at all the steps by using mass and atomic absorption spectrometry .",
    "the purification of the enriched samples was performed by distillation through graphite filter in vacuum of 10@xmath17 torr @xcite .",
    "the procedure allowed to purify the enriched @xmath16cd samples to the level of @xmath18 1 ppm ( fe , mg , mn , cr , v , co ) , @xmath18 0.2 ppm ( ni , cu ) , and @xmath18 0.1 ppm ( th , u , ra , k , rb , bi , pb , lu , sm ) .    after dissolving the metallic cadmium in nitric acid , the purification of cadmium nitrate",
    "was realized by the coprecipitation of the impurities on a collector .",
    "tungsten was purified by recrystallization of ammonium para - tungstate .",
    "solutions of cadmium nitrate and ammonium para - tungstate were mixed and then heated to precipitate cadmium tungstate :    cd(no@xmath19)@xmath20 + ( nh@xmath2)@xmath20wo@xmath2 @xmath21 cdwo@xmath2 + 2nh@xmath2no@xmath19 .",
    "all the operations were realized by using quartz , teflon and polypropylene labware , materials with low level of radioactive contaminations .",

    "for example , the attenuation length of the @xmath0cdwo@xmath2 and @xmath1cdwo@xmath2 scintillation elements were measured as ( @xmath22 ) and ( @xmath23 ) cm , respectively , at the wavelength of the emission maximum ( 490 nm ) .    the isotopic concentration of the isotopes of interest in the @xmath0cdwo@xmath2 and @xmath1cdwo@xmath2 crystals was measured by mass - spectrometry as 66.41(5)% and 82.2(1)% , respectivelycd and @xmath1cd in natural cd : 1.25(6)% and 7.49(18)% , respectively @xcite . ] .",

    "are presented in table [ table:01 ] where the data on radioactive contamination of enriched @xmath1cdwo@xmath2 crystals used in the solotvina experiment and of cdwo@xmath2 scintillators produced from cadmium with the natural isotopic composition are given for comparison .",

    "we explain presence of @xmath11 active @xmath29cd by strong neutron activation of natural cadmium samples used in the enrichment procedure .    the radioactive contamination of the scraps after the @xmath1cdwo@xmath2 boule growth is much higher than that of the @xmath1cdwo@xmath2 crystals .",
    "from the comparison of the data listed in table 1 , one can conclude that segregation of k , th , and especially of ra , by @xmath1cdwo@xmath2 scintillator is very low .",
