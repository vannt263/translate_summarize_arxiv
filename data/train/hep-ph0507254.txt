    "quark - hadron duality implies that in certain kinematic regimes , properly averaged hadronic observables can be described by a perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculation .",
    "this version of duality is highly relevant as perturbative qcd calculations can be performed . using duality , these pqcd calculations",
    "can then be related to averaged data taken in the resonance region .",
    "duality was first observed more than 30 years ago experimentally by bloom and gilman in inclusive inelastic electron scattering @xcite , and has since then been observed in a variety of reactions : @xmath0 is an example for duality we know from the textbooks , the semileptonic decay of heavy mesons is another example @xcite , duality is considered in the analysis of heavy ion reactions @xcite , and forms the basis for using qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "recently , duality has been observed to high precision and down to rather low momentum transfers in electron scattering at jefferson lab @xcite .",
    "duality in spin observables is currently probed by several experiments , both at jefferson lab and at desy in germany @xcite .",
    "in addition to the `` classical '' examples and applications of duality , duality ideas are applied in new areas , too . for neutrino scattering ,",
    "the beam energies are not well known , and an averaging will thus take place almost automatically .",
    "the application of duality is discussed for several planned neutrino experiments , see e.g. @xcite , and duality ideas have been applied in @xcite to nucleon / nuclear duality in neutrino scattering . there is also interest in duality in parity violation experiments @xcite , and with regard to generalized parton distributions @xcite . a very local version of duality - assuming that it holds for just one resonance - has been used in @xcite to extract information on structure functions at @xmath1 in the scaling limit from form factor data .",
    "these ideas were also applied to neutrino - nucleon scattering @xcite .",
    "duality ideas might also be useful for pion photoproduction @xcite .",
    "duality is a major point in the 12 gev upgrade of cebaf at jefferson lab @xcite .",
    "a recent review of quark - hadron duality can be found in @xcite .",
    "apart from being interesting all by itself , quark - hadron duality is an important tool for studying kinematic areas that can not be accessed in the deep inelastic regime : measurements at large values of @xmath2 in the resonance region typically have much higher count rates than measurements at the same @xmath2 in the deep inelastic regime , which requires very high four - momentum transfers @xmath3 .",
    "application of a proper averaging procedure to the resonance data may allow the extraction of deep inelastic information , e.g. in the case of the polarization asymmetry @xmath4 of the neutron for @xmath5 . before duality averaging procedures can be applied safely",
    ", we require a thorough understanding of where duality holds and how exact it is .",
    "therefore , duality has been studied intensively by theorists during the past couple of years @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical studies focus on duality in electron scattering , due to the large experimental program .",
    "the model we will discuss here is for electron scattering , too .",
    "many recent papers have been devoted to modeling quark - hadron duality in simple , fully solvable relativistic models , to gain a better understanding of the conditions under which duality works @xcite .",
    "the idea of modeling duality is to capture just the essential physical conditions of this rather complex phenomenon .",
    "typically , these basic requirements for a model are imposed : one requires a relativistic description of confined valence quarks , and one treats the hadrons in the infinitely narrow resonance approximation .    in these papers , one important point was raised and discussed that is interesting not just for duality , but in general : do the scaling curves obtained assuming outgoing plane waves agree with the scaling curves obtained when we assume final state interactions ?",
    "the general approach is to model the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) picture by considering a quark bound within a potential in the initial state , and after the interaction with a virtual photon , the quark is considered `` free '' and the potential set to zero .",
    "this `` bound - free '' transition corresponds to a plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) .",
    "this transition is compared with a hadronic picture : the initial state is the same - the quark is bound in a potential - but after the absorption of the photon , it is in an excited , but still bound , state .",
    "this `` bound - bound '' transition corresponds to the excitation of resonances .",
    "in order to reproduce duality , a model must fulfill several conditions that are observed experimentally : first , the bound - free transition , corresponding to pqcd , must scale for large momentum transfers .",
    "second , the bound - bound transition must scale , and the bound - bound and bound - free scaling functions have to agree so that the third condition can be fulfilled : at low momentum transfers , the bound - bound results should oscillate around the bound - free scaling curve . note that in all models currently proposed , there are no gluons included , and therefore neither radiative corrections nor evolution of scaling curves are present .",
    "in our recent papers @xcite , we could show analytically that the two different scaling curves , found for the bound - free and bound - bound transition , do coincide . in these papers , we considered a model where all particles were treated as scalars @xcite , and a model where only the quarks were treated as scalars , while electrons and photons had their proper spin @xcite .",
    "the treatment of the quarks as scalars considerably simplified our calculations , as the resulting klein - gordon equation could be solved analytically , by recognizing that it could be rewritten to resemble a schrdinger equation .",
    "once we introduced the proper spin for quarks @xcite , we solved the dirac equation numerically , using a runge - kutta - fehlberg ( rkf ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "the numerical accuracy we achieved this way restricted us to momentum transfers below @xmath6 , a value where the calculated response functions had not fully converged to their scaling value yet .",
    "even though we solved only for eigenenergies of up to @xmath7 , we found roughly 24,000 states below that energy .",
    "as for any relativistic problem , the density of energy states rapidly increases with the energy .",
    "thus , we could not determine if the bound - bound and bound - free scaling curves were going to coincide , as for the other , simplified models we investigated previously .    in a recent series of papers by paris et al .",
    "@xcite , similar models were considered , and solved numerically , and the result found there was a pronounced discrepancy between the bound - free and bound - bound transition .",
    "this led the authors to question the interpretation of the scaling curves extracted from deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) . in dis",
    ", it is generally assumed that final state interactions are negligible , and that the scaling curves can be interpreted in terms of parton distribution functions .    in this paper , we investigate the scaling behavior of our model with dirac quarks .",
    "we do this by employing the wkb method to solve the dirac equation numerically for very high momentum transfers .",
    "this allows us to investigate the scaling behavior of the response functions in the bound - bound transition at the relevant high momentum transfers .",
    "the bound - free transition does not require any complicated final state calculations , and can be evaluated in a straightforward manner .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : first , we remind the reader of the general ideas underlying the wkb approximation@xcite , and discuss the wkb for solving the dirac equation . then",
    ", we introduce our model and present numerical results obtained in the wkb approximation .",
    "we compare them to the results obtained by explicitly solving the differential equation at @xmath8 , the highest value accessible with the runge - kutta - fehlberg method .",
    "after validating the wkb calculations , we proceed to investigate the scaling behavior of the bound - bound and bound - free transitions at large @xmath9 , where convergence has set in .",
    "the dirac hamiltonian for a particle in a scalar filed @xmath10 and a time - like vector field @xmath11 is @xmath12 the wave functions for the dirac hamiltonian are @xmath13 where the @xmath14 are the usual spin spherical harmonics",
    ". then angular momentum quantum numbers are @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 for @xmath18 with @xmath19 for @xmath16 and @xmath20 for @xmath18 .",
    "the reduced radial wave functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 are solutions to the coupled equations @xmath23    the differential equation can be solved numerically , but above a certain energy , finding the numerical solution with a standard runge - kutta - fehlberg method @xcite becomes inaccurate . in the relativistic treatment of a potential ,",
    "the energy eigenvalues of higher states lie closer and closer together . at some high enough energy , the separation between neighboring states",
    "becomes so small that some states may be missed with shooting methods .",
    "also , one always has to calculate all states consecutively , instead of being able to calculate a state with certain , given quantum numbers .",
    "while an improved method for the integration of the differential equation may be applied , the situation lends itself to the application of a semiclassical approximation , the wkb method @xcite .",
    ".,height=384 ]    in order to illustrate that the assumptions of the wkb approximation are perfectly reasonable , we show a plot of a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator potential in fig .  [ figharm ] , together with the exact solution of the wave function for an energy @xmath24 .",
    "one can see that the wave function oscillates in the classically allowed region , where @xmath25 , and strongly resembles a plane wave there .",
    "outside of the classically allowed region , the wave function is damped and goes to zero .",
    "the wkb approximation can be applied when the potential has only a small variation over several wavelengths of the particle , as is the case in fig .",
    "[ figharm ] near the origin .",
    "this feature makes it quite useful for studying the highly energetic excited states of a particle bound in a potential .",
    "the wkb approximation assumes that in the classically allowed regions , the wave function can be approximated by a plane wave with a position dependent effective wave vector .",
    "as the potential is almost constant over a few wavelengths , the change of the wave vector is small compared with the value of the local wave vector .",
    "the wkb approximation can then be viewed as an expansion in derivatives of the effective phase . in the case of a one - dimensional wave equation , this is equivalent to an expansion in @xmath26 and is , therefore , often referred to as the semiclassical or quasiclassical approximation . in the case of the radial equation for a three - dimensional schrdinger wave equation",
    ", care must be taken to correctly treat the centrifugal barrier term that arises from the angular momentum operator acting on the angular functions .",
    "this term is also important for the solution of the corresponding classical problem , and needs to be included in the leading - order effective potential for the wkb approximation , even though it will involve powers of @xmath26 .",
    "the wkb approximation is then carried out by attaching an expansion parameter to the derivative terms in the wave equation and then proceeding as in the one - dimensional case .    to implement the wkb approximation for the dirac equation",
    "the radial equations ( [ diff1 ] ) and ( [ diff2 ] ) are modified by making the substitution @xmath27 and replacing the remaining factors of @xmath26 by the expansion parameter @xmath28 to give @xmath29 we now can parameterize the wave functions for positive energy solutions as @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the local phase for a plane wave and @xmath33 allows for differences in the upper and lower component wave functions . substituting these into ( [ diff1a ] ) and ( [ diff2a ] ) yields @xmath34 equation ( [ diff1b ] ) can be solved to give @xmath35 substituting ( [ bofr ] ) into ( [ diff2b ] ) produces the second order differential equation for the phase @xmath36    the wkb approximation is obtained by expanding the phase function in powers of @xmath28 as @xmath37 substituting ( [ phaseexp ] ) into ( [ wkb1 ] ) gives @xmath38 equating coefficients of like powers of @xmath28 gives @xmath39 for @xmath40 , and @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",

    "there is only one interval in @xmath53 which is classically allowed .",
    "it is bounded by the classical turning points @xmath54 which are the solutions to @xmath55 quantization of the bound states is obtained by requiring that @xmath56 where @xmath57 , as in the schrdinger case .",
    "the solutions can be extended to the classically forbidden regions by analytic continuation .",
    "since the @xmath58 vanishes at the classical turning points , the local wavelength @xmath59 becomes arbitrarily large near the classical turning points in contradiction to the basic assumption of the wkb approximation .",
    "the expansion in @xmath28 therefore does not converge in the vicinity of the classical turning points .",
    "techniques for matching the wave functions at the turning points and replacing them with smooth approximate wave functions near the turning points are well described in most introductory graduate quantum mechanics texts .",
    "there is , however , one additional complication in this case associated with the first - order phase @xmath60 which does not appear in the schrdinger case .",
    "this requires us to modify the usual approach to approximating the wave functions near the classical turning points . the solution to this complication",
    "is discussed in appendix a.    we will need to construct the wave functions in three regions : the classically forbidden region where @xmath61 ( region i ) ; the classically allowed region where @xmath62 ( region ii ) ; and the classically forbidden region where @xmath63 ( region iii ) .",
    "the wave functions must be matched at the boundaries .",

    "since we require that the wave functions be regular at the origin and damped at @xmath71 , we will construct the wave functions in the forbidden regions so that they fall off as @xmath53 moves away from the turning points .",
    "choosing @xmath72    the solutions in region i require that the sign of the root @xmath73 be chosen so that the wave function vanishes at the origin .",

    "the other two functions were obtained by solving two - dimensional matrix equations by introducing a dual set of spinors for a nonhermitian matrix and projecting to obtain scalar expressions for the phase function and the remaining amplitude function .",
    "however , this approach does not provide an expression for the first - order corrections to the phase that come from @xmath60 in the derivation given here .",
    "these contributions are necessary for a simple , smooth extrapolation of the wave functions over the regions where the wkb approximation does not converge .",
    "our model consists of a constituent quark bound to an infinitely heavy di - quark and is represented by the dirac hamiltonian for a particle in a scalar field @xmath10 and a time - like vector field @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath78 the scalar potential is a linear confining potential given by @xmath79 in our model , the vector potential is provided by a vector color coulomb potential .",
    "we will calculate for the case where the vector color coulomb potential is absent , that is @xmath80 , and where the vector potential is the simple static coulomb potential @xmath81 with @xmath82 . for convenience ,",
    "the mass has been chosen to be @xmath83 .",
    "for these potentials it is easily shown that the dirac wkb wave functions have the correct functional dependence near @xmath84 for all values of @xmath85 .",
    "note that we assume that the virtual photon only interacts with the light quark , and not with the infinitely heavy di - quark .",
    "this still allows us to gain qualitative insight into the issues of scaling and duality , but makes a direct comparison of numerical results from our model to experimental data impossible : our model is much closer to electron scattering from a @xmath86 meson than a proton .",
    "we would like to point out that therefore , the values obtained e.g. for the momentum transfer at the onset of scaling should not be compared to experimental values obtained in inclusive electron scattering from the proton .",

    "again , the rkf and wkb response functions are very similar at @xmath87 10 gev . as the momentum transfer increases , the longitudinal model response for the bound - bound transition appears to be approaching the bound - free result from above .",
    "for the transverse response , the bound - bound response is substantially smaller than the bound - free .",
    "although the bound - bound response does slowly approach the bound - free with increasing momentum transfer , it is still quite far from the bound - free at @xmath87 30 gev .",
    "also note that for the both longitudinal and transverse responses the shapes of the model result and the bound - free results are slightly different and this does not seem to be changing with momentum transfer .",
    "this seems to indicate that the bound - bound and bound - free responses are not dual once the coulomb potential is introduced .",
    "an extrapolation of the peak positions and values of the response functions has been performed fitting the bound - bound calculations at 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 and 30 gev to the form @xmath88 an estimate of the extrapolation error was obtained by varying the number of points in the fit from 3 to 5 .",
    "asymptotic values for the bound - free case are obtained directly from a direct calculation of the responses in the limit @xmath89 .",
    "the results of the extrapolation are shown in table [ asymptote ] .",
    "for the case of the linear potential the positions and peak values of the bound - bound response functions do not very significantly from the asymptotic bound - free response functions .",
    "however , for the linear - plus - coulomb potential , there is a consistent shift in the peak position and the difference for the height of the transverse response is substantial .",
    "a similar situation has been reported elsewhere for the case where the scalar and vector potentials are assumed to be identical linear confining potentials @xcite .    in this paper , we have presented a new method to solve the dirac equation for scalar and time - like vector potentials in the wkb approximation . we have applied this method to calculating the response functions of a light quark bound to an infinitely heavy di - quark in the bound - bound transition at very high momentum transfers .",
    "this type of calculation is relevant for modeling quark hadron duality .",
    "we compared these results to the bound - free transition , and found that the responses scale to the same limit for just a scalar potential .",

    "since the wkb expansion does not converge near the classical turning points , the wkb wave functions near these points are not a good approximation to the exact wave functions and are , in fact , singular at the turning points .",
    "this problem can be eliminated by matching the wkb wave functions at some distance from the turning points to an exact or approximate solution to the wave equations near the turning points .",
    "the usual approach is to approximate the solution near the turning points by assuming that the potential is roughly linear over the region where the wkb wave functions fail .",
    "this gives matching conditions that lead to the phase in ( [ matchphase ] ) and the corresponding wave functions are airy functions @xmath90 .",
    "the matching to the wkb wave functions is achieved by using the limiting properties of the airy function @xmath91 and @xmath92 where @xmath93 can be identified as the wkb phase function .",
