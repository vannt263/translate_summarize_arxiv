    "hadronic final states of @xmath0 annihilations have proven to provide precise tests of the strong interaction and of its underlying theory , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . the success and increasing significance of qcd tests which was achieved in the past few years , especially with the precise data from lep , was based on improvements and a deeper understanding of the theoretical predictions as well as of the experimental techniques , which both substantially profited from the experience of earlier studies with data from lower energy colliders .",
    "in fact , in many respects it seems desirable to return to the low energy @xmath0 data and reanalyse them with the knowledge of today .",
    "one reason behind this demand is that the size as well as the energy dependence of the strong coupling parameter @xmath1 is largest at lower energies , and thus the characteristic feature of qcd , asymptotic freedom and the running of @xmath1 , can be most significantly tested if reliable data at ` low ' energies are available ; see @xcite for a recent review .    in the light of these remarks ,",
    "a short historical review of qcd tests in @xmath0 annihilation will be given in this report . in section  2 ,",
    "selected highlights of early qcd studies , at energies below the @xmath2 pole , will be reviewed , and some of the original illustrations will be reproduced .",
    "section  3 contains a brief overview of qcd tests achieved at lep and at the slc . in section  4",
    ", the latest measurements of @xmath1 from lep at energies above the @xmath2 pole will be summarised .",
    "a comparison with measurements of @xmath1 from other processes will be given in section  5 , including an update of the world summary of @xmath1 determinations @xcite .",
    "in 1975 , the first evidence for jet structure in hadron production by @xmath0 annihilation \" was reported @xcite .",
    "the data , taken with the slac - lbl magnetic detector at the spear storage ring , showed increasing evidence for the production of two - jet like events when the center of mass energy , @xmath3 , was raised from 3 to 7.4 gev ( see fig .  [ 2-jet ] ) .",
    "the jet structure manifested itself as a decrease of the mean sphericity , which is a measure of the global shape of hadronic events .",
    "the angular distribution of the jet axes from the same measurement provided evidence that the underlying partons must have spin  @xmath4 .",
    "these observations , which were further corroborated by similar measurements at @xmath3 = 14 to 34 gev at the @xmath0 storage ring petra @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ tasso - s ] , confirmed the basic ideas of the quark - parton model , which relates the constituents of the static quark model with partons produced in particle collisions at high energies .",
    "-20 mm    6.0 cm    -45 mm    -8 mm 7.5 cm -12 mm    6.5 cm -10 mm    in 1979 , a small fraction of planar 3-jet events was observed by the petra experiments around @xmath5 gev @xcite , which was attributed to the emission of a third parton with zero electric charge and spin 1 @xcite , as expected for gluon bremsstrahlung predicted by qcd  @xcite .",
    "first evidence for 3-jet like events came from visual scans of the energy flow within hadronic events ( fig .",
    "[ tasso-3-jet ] ; see also fig .",
    "[ jade-3jet ] ) , followed by statistical analyses of global event shapes like oblateness ( fig .",
    "[ markj - o ] ) and of angular correlations which are sensitive to the gluon spin @xcite . at the end of 1979 ,",
    "the mark - j collaboration reported a first measurement of @xmath1 , in first order perturbative qcd , from the shape of the oblateness distribution @xcite . the first analysis based on the definition and reconstruction of resolvable jets",
    "was published in 1980 by the pluto collaboration @xcite , see fig .",

    "6.5 cm -10 mm    -5 mm 7.5 cm -10 mm    -5 mm 7.5 cm -12 mm    6.1 cm -12 mm    in 1981 , the jade collaboration found first evidence @xcite that the string hadronization model @xcite provides a better description of the observed hadron flow in 3-jet events than does an independent jet hadronization model .",
    "6.5 cm -10 mm    -4 mm 7.5 cm -10 mm    the year 1982 brought first evidence for 4-jet like events , observed by jade at @xmath3 = 33 gev @xcite , and the first determination of @xmath1 in second order perturbation theory ( @xmath6 )  @xcite , again by jade @xcite .",
    "the latter analysis was already based on principles and ideas which nowadays are standard for most of the @xmath1 analyses at slc and lep : an analytic qcd calculation in @xmath6 perturbation theory was fitted to a measured event shape distribution which had been corrected for detector resolution and hadronization effects ( fig .",
    "[ jade - as2 ] ) .    7.5 cm",
    "-10 mm    in 1986 jade published the first detailed analysis of n - jet event production rates @xcite , introducing a jet finding mechanism which has since then been used in many other studies .",
    "the ratio of 4-jet over 3-jet event production rates was found to be significantly larger than predicted by @xmath6 qcd , an observation that motivated studies of the influence of the choice of renormalization scales in finite order perturbative qcd @xcite . in 1988",
    "it was demonstrated by jade that the energy dependence of 3-jet event production rates gives evidence for the running of @xmath1 @xcite , see fig .",

    "the data are displayed in figures  [ asq97 ] and  [ asmz97 ] .",
    "perhaps the most relevant change of previously reported results is the one from @xmath16-nucleon scattering @xcite , which increased - due to a new energy calibration of the detector - from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "this partly resolves the outstanding problem that deep inelastic scattering results preferred lower values of @xmath19 then did measurements in @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "the distribution of the central values of @xmath19 is displayed in figure  [ asfreq ] , whereby the result from lattice qcd is not included because the relevance of its given uncertainty is not entirely clear .",
    "the unweighted mean of this distribution is 0.1186 , the root mean squared ( r.m.s . )",
    "is 0.0042 .",
    "this distribution , however , does not have a gaussian shape , and so the r.m.s .",
    "is not regarded as a good measure of the error of the average value of @xmath19 . owing to the fact that the dominating uncertainties of most @xmath1 measurements are theoretical rather than statistical or experimental , which may then be correlated to an unknown degree ,",
    "two alternatives to estimate the uncertainty of the average @xmath19 are applied :    first , it is demanded that at least 90% of the central values of all measurements must be inside the error interval .",
    "this gives @xmath20 , which can be regarded as a ` 90% confidence interval ' ( 68% confidence would correspond to @xmath21 ) .",
    "second , assuming that each result of @xmath19 has a boxed - shaped rather than a gaussian probability distribution over the interval of its quoted error , and summing all resulting weights for each numerical value of @xmath19 , leads to the distribution shown in figure  [ asint ] .",
    "the ( weighted ) mean of this distribution is almost identical to the unweighted average ( see fig .  [ asfreq ] ) , @xmath22 .",
    "this distribution now has a gaussian shape ; the r.m.s .",
    "is 0.0061 and the width of a gaussian fit to that distribution is 0.0057 .",
    "therefore the world average result is quoted to be @xmath23 where the error of 0.006 is perhaps a conservative but well defined estimate of the overall uncertainties .",
    "this average corresponds to the full line in figure  [ asq97 ] and to the dashed line plus the shaded band in figure  [ asmz97 ] .",
    "the agreement between the different measurements is excellent . due to the many new and recent measurements ,",
    "the running of @xmath1 as predicted by qcd is significantly proven by the data .",
