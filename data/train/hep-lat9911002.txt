    "domain wall fermions ( dwf ) @xcite provide a way to separate the approach to the continuum limit from the approach to the chiral limit . at fixed lattice spacing the chiral limit",
    "is approached as the size @xmath2 of the `` fifth '' direction is increased .",
    "furthermore , since this regulator does not break flavor symmetry and since the computing cost is only linear in @xmath2 it may be possible to simulate two flavor qcd with three light pions close to the finite temperature transition using today s supercomputers .",
    "preliminary results of qcd thermodynamic studies with dwf were presented in @xcite .",
    "results from simulations on @xmath3 lattices indicated the presence of a low temperature phase with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking but intact flavor symmetry and a high temperature phase with the full @xmath4 chiral flavor symmetry . also , preliminary results on @xmath0 lattices just above the deconfining transition indicated a difference in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 susceptibilities and screening masses .",
    "this was preliminary evidence for the anomalous breaking of the @xmath7 symmetry above the transition .    here",
    "the above preliminary results are extended in two directions : 1 ) the investigation of the @xmath7 axial symmetry breaking is completed with results at two values of the coupling close to the transition .",
    "2 ) a full study of the transition region on @xmath0 lattices is performed and is accompanied by scale setting calculations at the transition point to determine the transition temperature and the pion mass .",
    "some of these results have already been reported in @xcite . also see @xcite .",
    "the dwf action used in this work is as in @xcite with the modifications as in @xcite .",
    "some details on the numerical methods can be found in @xcite . for a review on dwf see @xcite and references therein .",
    "an important question concerns the role of the @xmath7 anomaly above the finite temperature qcd transition .",
    "earlier attempts to address this question @xcite using staggered fermions could not produce conclusive results because staggered fermions break the @xmath7 symmetry already at the classical level . on the other hand ,",
    "dwf bring this problem under control . in particular at @xmath9 massless dwf do not break the @xmath7 symmetry at the classical level .",
    "also , the dwf dirac operator can have exact zero modes @xcite , the necessary property for anomalous breaking . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that this property is maintained to a good approximation for fairly small masses and for @xmath2 as small as @xmath10 .",
    "the difference of the susceptibilities @xmath11 of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 is used as a measure of anomalous symmetry breaking .",
    "this difference was measured as a function of the bare quark mass @xmath12 on a @xmath13 lattice at @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the results are presented in figure 1 .",
    "the lines are fits to @xmath17 and have @xmath18 .",
    "the absence of a linear term indicates that for @xmath19 the chiral symmetry is effectively restored .",
    "the @xmath20 extrapolated values are @xmath21 at @xmath15 and @xmath22 at @xmath14 . although both are not zero by a statistically significant amount their value is small when compared with @xmath23 and @xmath24 which are @xmath25 .",
    "universality arguments require that if the qcd phase transition is to be second order , the anomalous @xmath26 must be broken .",
    "it is an open question as to whether the small size of the @xmath26 symmetry breaking seen here is sufficient to support this theoretical prediction that the two - flavor qcd phase transition is second order @xcite . for quenched qcd thermodynamic studies with dwf",
    "see @xcite , and with overlap fermions see @xcite .",
    "the transition region ( @xmath27 ) is studied on @xmath28 lattices using @xmath29 , a domain wall height @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "these values were chosen based on previous exploratory studies on smaller lattices @xcite .",
    "in particular @xmath32 was found to produce two flavor physics and @xmath31 to be large enough to keep the residual chiral symmetry breaking effects on the chiral condensate to the few percent level above the transition and to @xmath33 level below the transition .",
    "the results are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the gauge part of the action is a standard wilson plaquette action .    in order to set",
    "the scale a simulation @xcite on an @xmath34 lattice was done at @xmath35 corresponding to the middle of the transition region .",
    "it was found that in lattice units @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "this gives a value for the critical temperature @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the critical temperature is in agreement with results obtained from other fermion regulators @xcite .",
    "the pion mass is clearly too heavy to be able to extract useful information regarding the order of the transition .",
    "more sophisticated studies @xcite indicate that the residual chiral symmetry breaking effects are much larger than expected and in order to obtain a physical pion mass @xmath40 may be needed .",
    "large residual chiral symmetry breaking effects have been related to the `` roughness '' of the gauge field configurations @xcite . therefore",
    "a possible `` cure '' could be to use improved gauge actions .",
    "this idea was explored in zero temperature quenched qcd by using an iwasaki improved gauge action .",
    "dramatic improvements were seen at couplings that correspond to @xmath41 finite temperature quenched qcd just above the transition @xcite .",
    "these results prompted a study of the dynamical qcd finite temperature transition using iwasaki improved gauge action with @xmath42 .",
    "the results are presented in figure 3 .",
    "all parameters are the same as in figure 2 .",
    "again , in order to set the scale a simulation @xcite on an @xmath34 lattice was done at @xmath43 corresponding to the middle of the transition region .",
    "it was found that in lattice units @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "this gives a value for the critical temperature @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the critical temperature is in agreement with the wilson plaquette action results .",
    "however , the pion mass did not get lighter by a significant amount .",
    "the difference of the susceptibilities of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 was measured at two couplings just above the finite temperature transition .",
    "this difference was found to be non - zero by a statistically significant amount indicating that @xmath7 remains broken above but close to the transition .",
    "however , the value of the difference of the susceptibilities is much smaller than the susceptibilities themselves ( by a factor of @xmath48 for each point ) suggesting that the size of @xmath7 is indeed rather small at these couplings .",
    "it is an open question as to what effect this may have to the order of the transition .",
    "the transition region was studied by dynamical simulations on @xmath28 lattices with @xmath31 and the critical coupling was located . at that coupling zero temperature simulations",
    "were done on @xmath34 lattices in order to set the scale . for the gauge part of the action",
    "two different types were used .",
    "a standard plaquette action gave critical temperature @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "in an effort to reduce the pion mass an iwasaki gauge action was also used . for that action @xmath46 and @xmath49 .",
    "unfortunately the pion mass is still too heavy to allow a study of the order of the transition .",
    "larger values of @xmath2 or alternative improvement techniques must be employed in order to reduce the pion mass to physical values and still be able to study the transition with the available computing resources ."
