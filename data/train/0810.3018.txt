    "in 1955 , when writing an introductory solid - state textbook , @xcite rudolph peierls discovered that no one - dimensional metal could exist due to the electron - phonon coupling . indeed , a half - filled metal is unstable towards a lattice dimerization .",
    "the system undergoes a metal - insulator transition because the loss of elastic energy is made up for by the electronic energy acquired when the gap is opened .",
    "a quite similar process takes place in a one - dimensional antiferromagnet , giving rise to the so - called spin - peierls ( sp ) transition .",
    "@xcite the lattice dimerizes and the antiferromagnetic quasi long range order is replaced by a gapped singlet state . from this point of view , no one - dimensional antiferromagnetic system should be stable .    in spite of this general prediction , only few spin - peierls materials were found .",
    "most of them were observed in the early 70s in some organic charge transfer systems .",
    "however , direct spectral characterization was lacking due to the unavailability of large crystals for inelastic neutron scattering measurements . in this context",
    "the discovery of cugeo@xmath1 in 1993 , the first inorganic spin - peierls system , renewed the interest in this subject .",
    "large enough crystalline samples of cugeo@xmath1 could be obtained to undertake a detailed spectral characterization .",
    "an important conclusion of these studies was that in cugeo@xmath1 , the nonadiabatic character of the phonons @xcite is so important that the sp transition is not driven by a softening of a precursive phonon mode .",
    "it has been shown that an extension of the canonical theory of cross - fisher @xcite could explain this feature .",
    "@xcite moreover , the dispersion relation of the phonons in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic chains should be taken into account in a nonadiabatic sp system like cugeo@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite    the recent discovery of a spin - peierls transition in the tiox ( x = cl , br ) family has opened new questions about this spin - peierls paradigm .",
    "the essential building blocks of these compounds are bilayer structures of magnetically active ti ions connected by o ones .",
    "the position of a ti ion in a layer is shifted with respect to the other in the neighboring layer , forming something like an anisotropic triangular structure .",
    "in fact tiocl was initially thought to be a candidate for a _ resonating valence bond _ state , @xcite but it has been found to be mainly a one - dimensional magnetic system @xcite with the ti d@xmath2 orbitals pointing toward each other in the crystallographic @xmath3 direction .",
    "@xcite the high temperature magnetic susceptibility is well described by the bonner - fisher curve , indicating a nearest neighbor magnetic exchange @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite    the phase diagram of tiocl does not correspond to a canonical sp system in the sense that an incommensurate intermediate phase appears between the high temperature uniform phase and the low t dimerized phase .",
    "@xcite the transition temperatures are found to be @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in ref .",
    "it is also reported a very large energy gap of about @xmath7 in the low temperature phase and a pseudo spin gap below @xmath8 .",
    "the order of both transitions is still under debate .",
    "@xcite    the origin of the intermediate phase is controversial and not yet well understood . as the position of a ti ion in a chain is shifted with respect to another one in the neighboring chain , it is plausible to speculate that some type of competition between the in - chain and out - of - chain interactions could be the origin of the incommensurate phase .",
    "this was the idea of rckamp _",
    "et al_. @xcite who proposed a landau theory for the incommensurate transition .",
    "this phenomenological theory includes the tendency to dimerize of each chain and the coupling of the order parameter with the neighboring chain . as a result",
    "the incommensurate phase is accounted .",
    "however the sign and the value of the parameters are phenomenologically chosen and the connection with the underlying microscopic theory is not clear .    in view of the previous discussion , in this paper",
    "we propose a simplified microscopic model which accounts for the transition from the uniform to the incommensurate phase in tiocl .",
    "our model contains the relevant magnetic interaction , the phonons and the spin - phonon coupling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model ] we present the model and show that the essential ingredient leading to the incommensurate transition is that the phononic dispersion of the modes near @xmath9 is linear . in sec .",
    "[ tiocl ] we apply the model to tiocl .",
    "we start by fitting the parameters in order to account for the measured phononic frequencies and the value of the incommensurate wave vector at the transition temperature .",
    "after that , we obtain the dynamical structure factor of the phonons and compare it with the one obtained in x - ray experiments .",
    "the softening of a phonon and the loss of spectral weight when the transition approaches is correctly accounted . finally , in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] we discuss our results in comparison with another approach and summarize them .",
    "we include the ti atoms on the bilayer structure which interact by harmonic forces as depicted in fig .",
    "[ modelph2d ] . for simplicity we consider ionic displacements only in the direction of the magnetic chains . as the measured magnetic susceptibility of tiocl",
    "is well reproduced by a 1d heisenberg model , we assume that the ti atoms are magnetically coupled only along the @xmath3 direction .",
    "moreover , as a direct exchange seems to be the dominant ti - ti interaction , we assume that @xmath10 is modulated by the movement of nearest neighbor ti ions in the chain direction .",
    "our spin - phonon hamiltonian reads :    @xmath11\\rbrace,\\nonumber\\\\ h_s&=&j \\sum_{i , j }   \\textbf{s}_{i , j } \\cdot \\textbf{s}_{i+1,j},\\nonumber\\\\ h_{sph}&=&\\sum_{i , j } \\alpha ( u_{i+1,j}-u_{i , j})\\ , \\textbf{s}_{i , j } \\cdot \\textbf{s}_{i+1,j},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 is the momentum of the atom @xmath13 of the chain @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the displacements from the equilibrium positions along the direction @xmath3 of the magnetic chains , @xmath16 are spin-@xmath17 operators with exchange constant @xmath18 along the b - axis of a non - deformed underlying lattice , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the in - chain and inter - chain harmonic force constants as shown in the fig .

    "the quantized phonon normal coordinates are defined by @xmath27    it will be also useful to introduce a dimensionless spin - phonon coupling constant defined as in ref . : @xmath28    to compare with x - ray scattering data , the dynamical structure factor @xmath29 has to be determined .",
    "it is related to the phononic retarded green s function @xcite by @xmath30    where @xmath31    @xmath32 denotes the non - interacting phonon green s function defined by @xmath33    and @xmath34 is the phonon self - energy . in the following ,",
    "we treat the spin - phonon interaction using a random phase approximation ( rpa ) for the phonon self - energy term along with the expression obtained by cross and fisher @xcite using bosonization for the dimer - dimer correlation function in the heisenberg model : @xmath35    with @xmath36 let us start by identifying the structural transition of the model by searching the poles of the retarded green s function when @xmath37 over the ( @xmath38 ) plane of the first brillouin zone .",
    "they are given by the equation of the zeros in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ gret ] ) which reads : @xmath39 from this equation we obtain @xmath40 , the temperature where the renormalized frequency vanishes for each @xmath41 .",
    "the highest of these temperatures signals the _ * q * _ wave vector of the structure that will be developed at that t. for an isolated chain this transition takes place at @xmath42 , which is the usual spin - peierls transition towards the dimerized phase .",
    "how does this situation change when the system acquires a transversal dispersion due to an elastic coupling between the chains ?",
    "certainly , if the chains arrange in a rectangular geometry ( atoms in different chains align in phase ) , the dispersion of the phonons in the chain direction has a local maximum at @xmath43 and the @xmath40 given by ( [ tq ] ) has a maximum at @xmath42 .",
    "thus , no complete softening of an incommensurate mode is found .",
    "a crucial consideration here is that the dispersion given by eq .",
    "( [ wq ] ) , when expanded near @xmath43 , reads : @xmath44,\\\\ \\delta&\\equiv&\\pi - q_y , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e. it increases linearly near @xmath9 .",
    "plugging this expression in eq .",
    "( [ tq ] ) and expanding up to order @xmath45 we obtain : @xmath46,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where it was enough to calculate @xmath47 at @xmath43 as @xmath48 , with @xmath49 , because the first correction is of second order in @xmath45 .",
    "the temperature given in ( [ tlinear ] ) decreases with @xmath50 and increases for increasing @xmath45 .",
    "therefore an instability is predicted at @xmath51 and @xmath52 shifted from @xmath9 .",
    "the next orders of @xmath53 stabilize a local maximum at a given @xmath45 .",
    "thus , due to the linear dispersion of the relevant phonon mode , the model ( [ hspinph ] ) has a transition from a uniform to an incommensurate phase by lowering the temperature .",
    "the physical reason why this transition appears in the triangular arrangement and not in the rectangular one is that the elastic energy that the system gains by distorting the lattice in a modulated pattern decreases faster in the first case , when the wave vector of the modulation moves away from @xmath9 .",
    "this reduction overcomes the cost in the magnetic free energy the system should pay to separate from the dimerized state .",
    "this reduction does not take place in the rectangular case and the system never goes to an incommensurate phase but directly to a dimerized one .",
    "having shown that the uniform - incommensurate transition is present in our model , we will try to fit the parameters to account for the available experimental data of tiocl .",
    "we intend to reproduce the experimental incommensurate wave vector @xmath54 @xcite and the renormalized frequency of the phonons near the zone boundary at @xmath55 obtained in ref . by inelastic x - ray scattering . in order to do that we have to fix the free parameters of our model , i.e. the elastic constants and the spin - phonon coupling . usually the critical temperature is used to fix the spin - phonon coupling .",
    "this value could be obtained by numerical solution of eq .",
    "[ tq ] once the other parameters are known .",
    "the values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are fixed in such a way to fit the phononic frequencies measured by inelastic x - ray scattering at @xmath0 with the ones obtained from the positions of the peaks of @xmath56 .",
    "the value of the in - chain elastic constant was set to @xmath57 and the inter - chain one was fixed to @xmath58 .",
    "this enables us to fit the experimental frequencies near @xmath43 at @xmath55 with an spin - phonon coupling constant @xmath59 .",
    "the transition temperature is at 92k as in tiocl .",
    "however , using these parameters we obtain an incommensurated wave vector @xmath60 , i.e. it is close to @xmath9 and far away from the experimental value .",
    "our results together with the experimental ones are shown in fig .",
    "[ wvsqexperim2 ] . in this figure",
    "we see that , as we move away from the zone boundary , the dispersion curve quickly decreases and separates from the experimental points .",
    "moreover , the bare dispersion curve is very close to the @xmath55 one .",
    "( color online ) evolution with the temperature of the dressed frequency of the phonons along the ( @xmath61 ) path .",
    "the model parameters are @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath59 .",
    "the black dots are the experimental points obtained by inelastic x - ray scattering at @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite , width=264 ]    we have obtained a quite small value of the incommensuration with those parameters .",
    "therefore , in order to reproduce the experimental one , we increase the spin - phonon coupling @xmath64 .",
    "the new value turns out to be @xmath65 .",
    "this change has the undesired effect of increasing the transition temperature up to @xmath66 , more than twice the experimental transition temperature .",
    "moreover , if we want to keep adjusting the experimental x - ray phonons at @xmath55 , we have to increase the value of the bare phonon frequency because of the larger spin - phonon coupling .",
    "the chosen values are @xmath67 , @xmath63 , i.e. we have kept the ratio @xmath68 unchanged .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",

    "nevertheless , we have noted that with this set of parameters the transition temperature is overestimated .",
    "this problem is also present in the calculations of abel _ _ et al.__@xcite through an underestimation of the magnetic coupling j. we think that this disagreement is due to the adiabatic treatment of the phonons and will be solved by an extension of the results of ref . for the geometry of tiocl . in this paper",
    "it was shown that a theory going beyond the mean field rpa treatment of the phonons by including nonadiabatic effects predicts a reduction of the critical temperature for a given @xmath64 .",
    "we plan to undertake this generalization in a forthcoming paper , but let us make a rough estimation of the renormalization of the transition temperature using formula ( 35 ) of ref . .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath69 in ref .",
    "is not exactly the same as in the present paper .",
    "it is in this sense that the following results should be taken as an estimation . proceeding in this way",
    "we obtain : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the transition temperature obtained by the adiabatic approach .",
    "the non - adiabatic temperature is now very close to the experimental one .",
    "furthermore , let us estimate the energy gap by combining eqs .",
    "( 26 ) and ( 32 ) of the same reference : @xmath72 i.e. we obtain an excellent agreement with the experimental gap of 430k .",
