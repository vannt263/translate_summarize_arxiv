    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is operational , and taking data , with expected gains in energy and luminosity over the next few years .",
    "one important mission for the lhc will be to create dark matter ( dm ) which appears as missing energy in the reconstructed event . following a significant missing energy observation , the challenge will be to measure the properties of the dm candidate with sufficient accuracy to compare against cosmological and astrophysical constraints , such as the observed dm relic abundance and direct and indirect detection experiments .",
    "thus , determining the mass of the dm particle will have tremendous ramifications for astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "making dm mass measurements at the lhc , for example in models of supersymmetry ( susy ) or universal extra dimensions ( ued ) , is a difficult problem , since the dm particle is typically produced in pairs as products of complicated decay chains of parent particles .",
    "in fact , the number of states participating in the event can vary dramatically depending on the specific model .",
    "the identities , couplings , and masses of the particles involved in these processes may be unknown .",
    "let @xmath3 be the number of steps in the cascade between the production of the parent and the appearance of the dm child in the event .",
    "for @xmath4 , if all visible particles in the decay are detected , all masses of the parent , intermediate and visible and invisible child particles can , in principle , be determined uniquely ( see for example @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "the simplest case of @xmath5 proves to be more challenging . in fig .",
    "[ fig : decaychain ] we show a schematic of an @xmath6 process .",
    "we have also included the possibility that additional visible states are produced before the parents , which we refer to as up - stream radiation ( usr ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mt2prelim ] below , we will discuss the relevance of usr for dm mass determination .",
    "@xcite also study @xmath6 decay chains .",
    "[ fig : decaychain ]   class of processes considered in this work , with additional up - stream radiation ( usr ) .",
    "the parent particle is the state which decays to the visible particles and the child dm particles .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the motivation for studying dm mass determination in @xmath6 processes is many fold  we mention two here .",
    "first , within susy or ued , @xmath6 processes with additional usr can be important .",
    "for example , decays @xmath7 with initial state radiation , and @xmath8 ( for a sneutrino lightest susy particle ) , are of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : decaychain ] , where @xmath9 is a slepton , @xmath10 is a lepton , @xmath11 is a neutralino , @xmath12 is a squark , @xmath13 is a jet , @xmath14 is a chargino and @xmath15 is a sneutrino .",
    "although higher @xmath3 chains may also be present in many models , the combinatoric backgrounds can make mass extraction in such decay chains complicated .",
    "by contrast @xmath5 events are clean , and involve only two visible objects plus missing transverse momentum ( hereafter referred to as missing energy ) .",
    "also , since one will potentially observe @xmath6 chains if one of these theories is correct , it will be useful to extract as much information as possible from these signals .",
    "second , the observations of astrophysical anomalies , _ e.g.",
    "_ pamela @xcite and fermi @xcite , have led many to conjecture that the dm is leptophilic . models",
    "which generate such signals can , for example , be constructed by connecting the dm to the lepton asymmetry @xcite , or by positing that mixed sneutrinos constitute the dm @xcite .",
    "the simplest such dark sectors involve only a new mediator state and the leptophilic dm state , so that the dm is produced at a collider through the leptonic decay of the mediator .",
    "hence , the study of these processes is well motivated .",
    "the reader is referred to appendix [ sec : models ] for more detail on models where @xmath6 decay chains with usr are important .",
    "as shown in appendix [ sec : phasespaceandmt2 ] , the phase space for @xmath6 processes without usr depends on the combination @xmath16 and weakly on @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the parent mass , @xmath19 is the child mass and @xmath20 is the partonic center - of - mass energy .",
    "hence , extracting @xmath21 is simple , while measuring @xmath18 proves to be more challenging .",
    "current experimental methods for mass determination in events with missing energy rely on matrix element techniques . here",
    ", one begins by assuming a model which implies a matrix element with additional dependence on @xmath18 .",
    "then by fitting measured differential distributions , one can extract , in addition to the combination @xmath21 , the overall mass scale @xmath18 by observing how quickly the event rate falls off with @xmath20 .    in this paper",
    "we explore a different technique where the overall mass scale is determined from the transverse boosts given to the parent particles by usr .",
    "since the boost depends only on @xmath18 , _",
    "i.e. _ it is independent of the matrix element , the result is a model independent method for determining the overall mass scale .",
    "we explore a particular @xmath0 variant proposed in @xcite , which utilizes events with usr to separately extract the parent and child masses .",
    "we carry out the first full scale simulation of these @xmath0 based variants for dark matter mass determination , including detector effects , emphasizing the size of statistical errors and discussing various difficulties this method presents .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the @xmath0 variable , and the possibility of extracting parent and child mass separately in @xmath5 events with usr .",
    "next we turn to a numerical analysis of this @xmath0 based method and its efficiency in dm mass determination for a given number of @xmath6 events at the lhc .",
    "we then discuss additional sources of error beyond those explicitly contained in the previous section .",
    "finally , we conclude . in appendix",
    "a we outline some example models where this method would be relevant and in appendix b we show how the phase space for @xmath6 processes depends on the @xmath0 endpoint .",
    "we begin by reviewing the @xmath0 variable @xcite .",
    "since the lhc is a hadron collider , the initial parton longitudinal momenta are unknown .",
    "hence , only the total transverse momentum is constrained to be zero , and thus it becomes necessary to use transverse variables , such as @xmath0 , a generalization of the transverse mass ( see also @xcite ) . for the class of processes studied here ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : decaychain ] ) , there will be two missing particles in each event , so that the 4-momenta of the invisible child particles can not be determined .",
    "thus , only the total transverse missing momentum , @xmath22 , can be measured .",
    "in addition , the child particle mass , @xmath19 , is not known .",
    "however , a trial dm mass can be guessed , @xmath23 , and @xmath0 formed for each event as @xmath24,\\ ] ] where the minimization is performed over trial missing momenta for the two child particles , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , subject to the constraint that their sum be the total missing @xmath27 : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the transverse momentum of the @xmath30 visible particle , and we are neglecting here the possibility of additional usr . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mt2 ] ) , @xmath31 is the transverse mass of the visible and child particles using the guessed missing momentum , @xmath32 , and child trial mass @xmath23 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mass of the @xmath30 visible particle .",
    "the energies are formed in the usual way , @xmath35 when there is no usr , there exists a value of @xmath0 , referred to as an endpoint , above which the differential cross section , @xmath36 , rapidly approaches zero , which is given by @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the momentum of the invisible child in the parents rest frame .",
    "as we show in appendix [ sec : phasespaceandmt2 ] , @xmath5 chains only depend on @xmath21 up to small corrections due to the parent mass ( which is exploited by the matrix element methods ) .",
    "methods which do not capitalize on these corrections do not have enough information to extract both masses separately .",
    "this neglects , however , the potential for additional usr in the event .",
    "the usr can be in the form of jets coming from the initial state qcd radiation ( isr ) , or jets coming from the decays of heavy colored objects in @xmath39 processes , where the decay chain ends in the @xmath6 process of interest . by including the usr , eq .",
    "( [ ptbalance ] ) no longer obtains , and instead the total momentum of the visible and invisible particles must be balanced against the momentum of the radiation , @xmath40 , @xmath41    now the @xmath0 endpoint will depend on the upstream momentum @xcite : @xmath42^{1/2 } , &   \\mbox{if } \\tilde{m}_c \\leq m_{c } \\\\",
    "\\left[\\left(\\mu(-p_t ) + \\sqrt{\\left(\\mu(-p_t)-\\frac{p_t}{2}\\right)^2 + \\tilde{m}_c^2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{p_t^2}{4 } \\right]^{1/2 } , &   \\mbox{if } \\tilde{m}_c \\geq m_{c }   \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{eq : mt2withusr}\\ ] ] and @xmath43 the functional form for the @xmath0 endpoint depends on whether the test mass is larger or smaller than the true dm mass .",
    "hence , there is a discontinuity in the derivative with respect to the trial child mass of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mt2withusr ] ) above and below the true dm mass , @xmath19 , giving rise to a kink @xcite in the @xmath44 curve which can be utilized for extracting additional information beyond eq .",
    "( [ eq : mt2max ] ) . in principle , given an event with a specific value for the @xmath45 of the usr , one can now extract the parent and child masses .",
    "however , since one must do this analysis for a particular bin in @xmath45 , there is competition between the size of the bin  small bins imply small statistical samples  and the accuracy of the measurement .",
    "another method was proposed in @xcite , which sidesteps the problem of binning by utilizing the whole range of @xmath45 . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mt2max ] ) and ( [ eq : mt2withusr ] ) , it can be seen that @xmath46 is unchanged by the effects of the @xmath45 when @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown @xcite that @xmath48 where the equality only holds when @xmath47 .",
    "thus one can construct a new variable @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the heaviside function and @xmath51 is the measured value of @xmath52 .",
    "it is this variable we will be minimizing to find the correct child mass . in fig .",
    "[ fig : examplebowl ] , we plot @xmath53 vs. @xmath23 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "since the shape is  bowl \"- like , we refer to this construction as an @xmath0 bowl . unless otherwise specified , all events were simulated with the madgraph 4.4 event generator @xcite , showered by pythia 6.4 @xcite , and run through the detector simulation software pgs 3.3 @xcite .",
    "note that we use the madgraph default settings which defines a lepton as having @xmath56 gev and a jet as having @xmath57 gev .",
    "bowl for 50,000 smuon pair production events with qcd usr .",
    "the parent mass is 300 gev and the child mass is 150 gev .",
    "the events were run through the pgs detector simulator.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "in this section we will calculate the statistical errors for child mass determination with @xmath0 bowls .",
    "clearly , eq .  ( [ kineqn ] ) only depends on the kinematics of the event , _",
    "i.e. _ it is independent of the quantum numbers , including the spin , of the underlying particles .",
    "then , up to small corrections due to the steepness of the @xmath0 distribution about this endpoint , there are only @xmath58 differences in the bowls around the minimum for different parent spins .",
    "hence , we can study the effectiveness of this variable for a wide variety of models by only scanning over the masses of the parent and child particles .",
    "we take @xmath59 as our benchmark parameters .    for reference we provide the overall cross section for these benchmark models in table  [ tab : benchmarkcrosssections ] , where we have assumed that the production occurs via electroweak processes , including the effects of qcd isr .",
    "neglecting diagrams which involve additional new - physics states , the overall rates only depend on the spin of the parent up to @xmath58 factors due to the choice of @xmath60 representation . for reference ,",
    "the scalar example process is @xmath61 where @xmath9 is a slepton and @xmath11 is the lightest neutralino .",
    "this is the process we simulate for our benchmarks with qcd isr . for reference ,",
    "a fermionic example process is @xmath62 where @xmath14 is a chargino and @xmath15 is a sterile sneutrino .",
    "for some details of these and other models which have @xmath6 processes , see appendix [ sec : models ] .",
    "our results below will be given in terms of the number of events before cuts , so table  [ tab : benchmarkcrosssections ] can be used to estimate the reach of actual models .",
