    "clearly @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in summary ,",
    "the pdf of @xmath3 conditioning on @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 practically , @xmath11 is known , observable , or can be reliably estimated from other sources .",
    "that is , conditioning on @xmath11 , @xmath3 follows a mixture model with known mixing proportions .",
    "our main interest in this paper is to estimate @xmath5 nonparametrically .",
    "recently , data of the mixture structure in ( [ mix - model ] ) have been more and more frequently identified in the literature and in practice .",
    "acar and sun ( 2013 ) provided one example of such data . in the genetic association study of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) ,",
    "the corresponding genotypes of snps are usually not deterministic ; in the resultant data , they are typically delivered as genotype probabilities from various genotype calling or imputation algorithms ( see for example li et  al . 2009 and carvalho et  al . 2010 ) .",
    "ma and wang ( 2012 ) summarized two types of genetic epidemiology studies under which mixture data of such kind are collected .",
    "these studies are kin - cohort studies ( wang et  al .",
    "2008 ) and quantitative trait locus studies ( lander and botstein  1989 ; wu et  al .",
    "2007 ) ; see also wang et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) and the references therein .",
    "section [ section - read - data ] also gives an example of such data in the malaria study .",
    "more examples and the corresponding statistical research can be founded in ma et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) , qin et  al .",
    "( 2014 ) , and the references therein .    with the data of the mixture structure in ( [ mix - model ] ) , statistical methods for estimating the component cumulative distribution functions ( cdfs ) have been established in the literature .",
    "a comprehensive overview of these developments is as follows .",
    "ma and wang ( 2012 ) pointed out that the classic maximum empirical likelihood estimators of these component cdfs are either highly inefficient or inconsistent .",
    "they proposed a class of weighted least square estimators .",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and ma and wang ( 2014 ) proposed consistent and efficient nonparametric estimators based on estimating equations for the component cdfs when the data are censored .",
    "qin et  al .",
    "( 2014 ) considered another class of estimators for the component cdfs by maximizing the binomial likelihood .",
    "their method can be applied to data with censored or a non - censored structure .",
    "we observe that all these works were focused on the estimation of cdfs and assumed @xmath11 to be a discrete random vector .",
    "the estimation of the pdfs are less addressed in the literature . as far as we are aware , to date ma et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) is the only existing reference that considered the component density estimation under the setup of model ( [ mix - model ] ) .",
    "they proposed a family of kernel - based weighted least squares estimators for the component pdfs under the assumption that @xmath11 is continuous .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , there are two limitations in their approach : ( 1 ) the resultant estimates do not inherit the nonnegativity property of a regular density function ; as is well known , such a property is often important in many downstream density - based studies . in that paper , though authors have discussed an em - like algorithm to achieve nonnegative component density estimates , the corresponding theoretical properties as well as the numerical performance of these estimates were not studied yet . ( 2 ) when dealing with some practical problems , this method does not make full use of the data and therefore the resultant density estimation may not be as efficient .",
    "we refer to the end of section [ section - sim ] for an example and further discussion .",
    "in this paper , we consider maximum smoothed likelihood ( eggermont and lariccia 2001 , chapter 4 ) estimators for @xmath13 , namely @xmath14 , which maximize a smoothed likelihood function and inherit all the important properties of pdfs .",
    "our method can handle data with @xmath11 s continuous or discrete .",
    "we also propose a majorization - minimization algorithm that computes these density estimates numerically .",
    "this algorithm incorporates similar ideas as levine et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) and the em - like algorithm ( hall et  al .",
    "we show that under finite samples , starting from any initial value , this algorithm not only increases the smoothed likelihood function but also leads to estimates that maximize the smoothed likelihood function .",
    "another main contribution of this paper is to establish the @xmath15 asymptotic consistency and the corresponding convergence rate for our density estimates .",
    "because of the properties ( see section [ section-3 ] ) of the non - linear operator ",
    "@xmath16 \" defined in section [ section-2 ] and the complicated form of the smoothed log - likelihood function , the development of the asymptotic theories for the nonparametric density estimates under the framework of mixture model is technically challenging and still lacking in the literature .",
    "we solve this problem by employing the advanced theories in empirical process ( see van der vaart and wellner  1996 , kosorok  2008 , and the references therein ) .",
    "we expect that the technical tools established in this paper may benefit the future study on the asymptotic theories of the nonparametric density estimates for mixture model of other kinds ; see for example levine et  al .  (",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ section-2 ] presents our proposed density estimates based on smoothed likelihood principal .",
    "section [ section - mm - alg ] suggests a majorization - minimization algorithm to numerically compute these density estimates , and establishes the finite - sample convergence properties of this algorithm .",
    "section [ section-3 ] studies the asymptotic behaviors of our density estimators .",

    "section [ section - sim ] conducts simulation studies , which show that the proposed method is more efficient than existing methods in terms of integrated square error .",
    "section [ section - read - data ] applies our method to a real data example .",
    "the technical details are relegated to the appendix .",
    "with the observed data @xmath17 from model ( [ mix - model ] ) , we propose a maximum smoothed likelihood method for estimating @xmath13 .",
    "we consider the set of functions @xmath18 furthermore , we assume that @xmath19 s have the common support @xmath20",
    ".    given model ( [ mix - model ] ) and observations @xmath21 , the conditional log - likelihood can be written as @xmath22 however , as is well known , this log - likelihood function is unbounded in @xmath23 ; see page 25 in silverman ( 1986 ) and page 111 in eggermont and lariccia ( 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , the corresponding maximum likelihood estimates do not exist .",
    "this unboundedness problem can be solved by incorporating the smoothed likelihood approach ( eggermont and lariccia , 1995 , groeneboom et  al .",

    "specifically , we define the smoothed log - likelihood of @xmath24 to be @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the nonlinear smoothing operator for a density function @xmath27 , represented by @xmath28 here @xmath29 , @xmath30 is a kernel function supported on @xmath31 $ ] , and @xmath32 is the bandwidth for the nonlinear smoothing operator . by convention , we define @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .    our proposed maximum smoothed likelihood estimators for @xmath36 are given by @xmath37 we observe that the smoothed likelihood function defined in ( [ def - l - n ] ) has the following properties .",

    "second , if the kernel function @xmath39 is bounded and @xmath40 , @xmath41 are fixed , then @xmath38 is also bounded in @xmath23 , since for every @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44\\le   \\sup_t k(t)/h_j.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the maximizer of @xmath38 exists , i.e. , the optimization problem ( [ def - f - hat ] ) is well defined .",
    "furthermore , if we assume that for every @xmath41 , the @xmath3 s corresponding to @xmath45 are dense in @xmath20 , then @xmath38 is strictly concave in @xmath23 and thus the solution to the optimization problem ( [ def - f - hat ] ) is unique . here , ",

    "in this section , we propose an algorithm that numerically calculates @xmath49 with given bandwidths @xmath50 and study the finite - sample convergence property of this algorithm .",
    "the proposed algorithm , called the majorization - minimization algorithm , is in spirit similar to the majorization - minimization algorithm in levine  et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) . to facilitate our theoretical development ,",
    "we define the majorization - minimization updating operator @xmath51 on @xmath23 as follows . for any @xmath52 ,",

    ", @xmath65 belongs to the class of functions @xmath66 : @xmath67 therefore , @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "next , we study the finite - sample convergence property of this majorization - minimization algorithm ; we observe that the technical development for such a convergence property is nontrivial .",

    "corollary [ corollary-1 ] benefits our subsequent technical development of the asymptotic theories for @xmath14 in section [ section-3 ] .",
    "it indicates that the solution of ( [ def - f - hat ] ) is equivalent to the solution of @xmath78 as long as the stated condition @xmath72 for every @xmath7 is satisfied .",
    "this condition is quite reasonable since if @xmath79 for some @xmath7 then the @xmath7th subpopulation does not appear in the data and we can delete the corresponding @xmath80 from the mixture model ( [ mix - model ] ) . therefore , developing the asymptotic theories for @xmath14 from ( [ def - f - hat ] ) is equivalent to developing those from ( [ def - f - hat-1 ] ) .",
    "based on theorem [ theorem-1-added-1 ] , we show the convergence of the updating sequence @xmath81 to its global maximum , which implies the convergence of the proposed majorization - minimization algorithm .",

    "therefore , we can only show that the updating sequence @xmath84 converges to the maximum of @xmath85 .",
    "note that this does not guarantee the convergence of @xmath60 to @xmath76 , i.e. , the maximizer of @xmath85 , because such a maximizer may not be uniquely defined .",
    "instead , referring to the proof of this theorem , we have shown that there exists at least a subsequence of @xmath60 converging to a maximizer of @xmath85 . furthermore ,",
    "if we impose some technical condition such that @xmath38 is strictly concave , @xmath76 is then uniquely defined by ( [ def - f - hat ] ) .",

    "we refer to levine et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for more discussion of such a method .",
    "in this section , we investigate the asymptotic behaviors of @xmath88 given in ( [ def - f - hat ] ) .",

    "the main obstacles are due to the following undesirable properties of @xmath26 with @xmath108 being an arbitrary pdf .",
    "firstly , @xmath109 is neither a density nor necessarily sufficiently close to the corresponding @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , the well developed empirical process theories and technics for m - estimators in density estimation ( see for example section 3.4.1 in van der vaart and wellner 1996 ) is not directly applicable .",
    "secondly , @xmath26 introduces significant bias on the boundary of the support of @xmath108 .",
    "for example , if @xmath108 is supported on @xmath110 $ ] , then @xmath26 is supported on @xmath111 $ ] .",

    "[ theorem-3 ] and [ theorem-4 ] may not be the optimal .",

    "consider the extreme case that even though @xmath106 s are estimated ideally well , @xmath119 say , one can show that the best rate for @xmath118 is still bounded by @xmath117 .",

    "therefore , we use these observations to select the bandwidth for the corresponding density estimates in the current iteration .",
