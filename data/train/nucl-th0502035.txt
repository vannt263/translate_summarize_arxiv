    "the width @xmath47 could be very small ( smaller than the gamma width ) in a relatively broad range of the three - body decay energies @xcite . in that case the reaction rate depends _ only _ on @xmath47 .",
    "\\(iv ) eq .  ( [ eq : prod - rate - total ] ) gives the formula for reaction rate , which is the same as one , known for a long time ( see e.g.  eq .",

    "the result of our derivation here is clearer understanding of the fact that this formula already correctly and completely include both sequential capture and direct capture reactions .",
    "so , we see that for the resonant part of the reaction rate the sequential formalism treatment is overcomplicated and incomplete .",
    "this is not a great issue in most cases , but there are situations , where it becomes important .",

    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "the derivations of the reaction rates above in sections [ sec : seq - cap ] and [ sec : dir - capt ] are quite schematic .",
    "they basically rely on assumptions about existence of definite asymptotics of the three - body problem , which could be not evident .",
    "they require if not a proof then at least some discussion .    for sequential formalism",
    "we need that there exists a long - living resonance state in the @xmath95 jacobi subsystem ( at energy @xmath96 and with width @xmath97 ) .",
    "then the asymptotic implied in derivations of sec.[sec : seq - cap ] is @xmath98 for the direct capture the assumed asymptotic is @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",

    "the average distances between protons are about @xmath103 fm and for characteristic temperatures the debye screening radii are @xmath104 fm . beyond these radii we have a formal right to use the forms ( [ eq : seq - ass ] ) and ( [ eq : dir - ass ] ) .",
    "it should be understood that in a very formal sense the asymptotic ( [ eq : seq - ass ] ) is not valid . in the limit of infinite distance",
    "a long - living two - body state finally decays and the asymptotic ( [ eq : seq - ass ] ) should be replaced by ( [ eq : dir - ass ] ) .",
    "however , from practical side the separation of asymptotics ( [ eq : seq - ass ] ) and ( [ eq : dir - ass ] ) is reasonable .",
    "a nice example ( also relevant to the further discussion ) of the coexistence of the three - body and binary asymptotics is the decay of @xmath105be @xmath106 state at 2.429 mev .",
    "the branchings to the three - body channel @xmath107 and binary channel @xmath108 are comparable ( @xmath109 and @xmath110 @xcite ) , which is experimentally well observed ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case of binary decay",
    "the average flight distance of the @xmath111be g.s.resonance ( @xmath112 ev ) is around @xmath113 fm .",
    "thus it is clear that for some practical purposes the assumption of eq .",

    "( [ eq : seq - ass ] ) to eq .",

    "for example , for the width of the intermediate resonance @xmath97 around 100 kev ( and typical @xmath114 mev ) the average flight distance of this resonance is around 100 fm .",
    "this is much smaller than the typical distance between protons in the stellar media and then usage of eq .",
    "( [ eq : seq - ass ] ) and chemical balance description by the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sys - eq ] ) loose sense .",
    "the asymptotics ( [ eq : seq - ass ] ) and ( [ eq : dir - ass ] ) are located in the same space and could have the same quantum numbers .",
    "however , we can can speak about orthogonality of these asymptotics in definite sense and then treat currents associated with them independent .",
    "only this assumption makes possible the separate treatment of sequential and direct decay channels in sections [ sec : seq - cap ] and [ sec : dir - capt ] .",
    "the asymptotic ( [ eq : seq - ass ] ) is typically localized in a very small part of the phase space .",
    "formally this corresponds to the fact that the hyperspherical series for binary channel ( at given hyperradius ) is very long ( with many significant terms ) , while for asymptotic ( [ eq : dir - ass ] ) we can expect that only the lowest hyperspherical harmonics in the decomposition are significant .",
    "thus the sequential and direct channels are practically orthogonal on the hypersphere of a large radius . with increase of the radius",
    "this `` orthogonality '' ( called asymptotic orthogonality ) becomes better , until the effect of the @xmath95 subsystem decay becomes important .",
    "again , on the example of the @xmath106 state of @xmath105be , the level of overlap between the direct and sequential decay channels in the momentum space can be estimated as @xmath115 which is clearly a very small value . when there is no such a reliable separation between channels ( [ eq : seq - ass ] ) and ( [ eq : dir - ass ] ) any more ( the intermediate resonances are too broad ) we have a formal right to speak only about asymptotic ( [ eq : dir - ass ] ) .    to finalize this discussion , the derivations in sections [ sec : seq - cap ] and [ sec : dir - capt ] were done as if only one type of the asymptotic exists . from formal point of view only asymptotic of eq .",

    "( [ eq : dir - ass ] ) exists or ( ii ) both asymptotics eqs .",
    "( [ eq : seq - ass ] ) and ( [ eq : dir - ass ] ) are present simultaneously .",
    "the asymptotic ( [ eq : dir - ass ] ) exists in the three - body problem unconditionally , while the existence of ( [ eq : seq - ass ] ) is subject to availability of _ sufficiently narrow _ intermediate resonances for the decay . in the case ( ii ) , the regions of the domination of each asymptotic are separated by a complicated surface in the phase space .",
    "some discussion of the relevant questions can be found , for example , in ref .",
    "so , the phase space integration in sections [ sec : seq - cap ] and [ sec : dir - capt ] should have been done not over all the space , but over regions of validity for each type of asymptotic .",
    "this is clear , however , that this imperfection does not influence the final result .",
    "the reasons are that ( i ) the contribution of the asymptotic of the selected kind in the phase space outside the region of its domination is typically negligible and ( ii ) anyhow we are interested in the contribution of the both kinds of asymptotics simultaneously .",
