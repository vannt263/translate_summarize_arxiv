    "actually , if @xmath19 is a ball then the value of @xmath132 is nothing but the radius of @xmath133 . ]",
    "this algebraic system is invertible under the same conditions as ( [ fracqcfracmain-1 ] ) .",
    "these results say that the dominant term in the approximation ( [ x oustdie1 d_m farmain ] ) , and similarly the one in ( [ x oustdie1 d_m farmain-1 ] ) , is the foldy - lax field corresponding to the scattering by the point - like scatterers located at the centers @xmath18 s of the scatterers @xmath19 s with @xmath20 as the related scattering coefficients .",
    "this foldy - lax field describes the field that results in the multiple scattering between the different scatterers @xmath19 s , see @xcite and the references therein for more information on this issue .",
    "the accuracy of the approximation of the scattered field by the foldy - lax field depends of course on the error estimates . in its generality",
    ", this issue is still largely open but there is an increase of interest to understand it , see for instance .    the formal asymptotic expansion ( [ x oustdie1 d_m farmain ] ) was already given in @xcite .",
    "the results in theorem [ maintheorem - ac - small - sing ] and in corollary [ maintheorem - ac - small - sing-1 ] provide the rigorous justification of the approximation of the scattered field taking into account all the involved parameters : the maximum diameter @xmath5 , the number @xmath4 , the minimum distance @xmath6 and the surface impedance @xmath9 s including the regime defined by @xmath134 .",
    "we characterized the set of parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 where the approximation makes sense and we provided the approximation with explicit error estimates in terms of these parameters .",
    "these approximation formulas can be used for different purposes :    1 .",
    "first , they can be used for imaging where the small anomalies are modeled by the small bodies .",
    "there is a large literature on the mathematical imaging of small anomalies , see for instance @xcite and the references therein .",
    "compared to those results , we can allow the small bodies to be dense and very close , since their number @xmath4 can be very large and the minimum distance @xmath6 can be as small as we want .",
    "this last property means that we deal with the mesoscale regime , where @xmath135 and @xmath136 is the minimum distance between the centers of the small scatterers , compare with @xcite .",
    "second , these approximations can be used for the design of new indices of refraction .",
    "when the small scatterers are periodically distributed , this can be justified by homogenization , see @xcite . using the approximations in ( [ x oustdie1 d_m farmain ] ) and ( [ x oustdie1 d_m farmain-1 ] ) , we do not need such periodicity in the distribution of the small scatterers .",
    "this observation has been already made in @xcite with quite formal computations .",
    "let us observe that in our approximations in theorem [ maintheorem - ac - small - sing ] and in corollary [ maintheorem - ac - small - sing-1 ] , we allow the surface impedance to have negative imaginary parts . with this freedom of taking the surface impedance , we can generate a large class of indices of refraction with possible applications to the acoustic metamaterials .",
    "details on this issue are reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let us emphasize that we provide those results with explicit error estimates .",
    "this gives more credits to the feasibility of the design process .",
    "third , these approximations can be used to extract the values of the index of refraction @xmath137 from the farfields corresponding to few incident directions .",
    "the idea of adding small inclusions to deform the medium and then extract the field inside the support of the medium is already described and used in the literature , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the extraction of the index of refraction ( or other coefficients ) from the internal measurements , related also to the hybrid imaging methods , has recently attracted the attention of many authors , see for instance @xcite and the references therein .",
    "one of the main difficulties is to handle the possible zeros of the total field .",
    "what we propose is to deform the medium using multiple ( and close ) inclusions instead of only single ones . in this case , what we derive from the asymptotic expansions are the internal values of the green s function and not only the total fields .",
    "finally , the values of the index of refraction can be extracted from the singularities of these green s function .",
    "hence , we avoid the problems coming from the zeros of the internal fields . these arguments are reported in @xcite .",
    "to finish this introduction , we discuss the two extreme cases given by the neumann and the dirichlet boundary conditions . in the former case ,",
    "@xmath9 s are all zero . in the results stated above",
    ", we see that @xmath9 s are not allowed to be simultaneously zero .",
    "otherwise all the coefficients @xmath138 , will be zero and hence all the constants @xmath139 , vanish and the expansion ( [ x oustdie1 d_m farmain ] ) will make no sense .",
    "the case where @xmath140 , is quite tedious but interesting .    * technically",
    ", we see in ( [ q_mintdbl-3 ] ) , for instance , that in this case we need to go to the higher order in the expansion . doing that requires quite tedious computations remembering that we are taking into account all the parameters describing the scatterers ( @xmath141 and @xmath6 ) . *",
    "this particular case is interesting because in this case the dominant coefficients are defined by _",
    "matrices _ and not vectors ( as the vector @xmath142 in the case where @xmath143 ) .",
    "but this is not a surprise since the dominant term of the expansion of the far - fields are the foldy - lax fields modeling the interaction of the multiple point - like scatterers ( given here by the centers of the scatterers ) . for hard scatterers , we talk about anisotropic interaction between the scatterers , see the book @xcite for more information about this issue , contrary to the impedance case where the interaction is isotropic . due to this anisotropic character of the dominant term , the equivalent medium ( when we distribute a cluster of small scatterers with neumann boundary conditions )",
    "is characterized by a divergence form helmholtz model where the coefficient appearing in the higher order derivative is a matrix ( defined by the ( scaled ) matrix - coefficients appearing in the dominant term of the expansions ) .",
    "these arguments need to be mathematically justified and quantified .",
    "the approximation in the dirichlet case is discussed in @xcite where it is justified under the condition that @xmath144 is bounded , by a constant depending only some a priori bounds , which means , in the scales we use here , that @xmath145 , or @xmath146 . since the small obstacles are distributed in a bounded domain @xmath1",
    ", then we have the natural condition on their number @xmath147 , i.e. @xmath148 . in the present work",
    ", this last condition is the only one we ( naturally ) impose on @xmath27 .",
    "hence , compared to @xcite , we allow here the small scatterers to be as close as we want since @xmath27 can be as large as we want , i.e. we cover the mesoscale regime .",
    "however , we believe that the conditions used in @xcite can be improved to be comparable to the ones we impose here .    the rest of the paper is devoted to prove theorem [ maintheorem - ac - small - sing ] and corollary [ maintheorem - ac - small - sing-1 ] . in section 2 , we describe briefly the main steps of the proof of theorem [ maintheorem - ac - small - sing ] .",
    "the detailed proof of theorem [ maintheorem - ac - small - sing ] is done in section 3 while the one of corollary [ maintheorem - ac - small - sing-1 ] is given in section 4 .",
    "the justification of remark [ remark - spherical - scatterers ] is discussed in section 5 . in the appendix , we deal with invertibility of the algebraic system ( [ fracqcfracmain ] ) ( and similarly for ( [ fracqcfracmain-1 ] ) ) .",
    "let us here describe very briefly the main steps of the proof of theorem [ maintheorem - ac - small - sing ] .",
    "firts of all , the scattering problem has a unique solution and it can be represented via single layer potentials @xmath149 where @xmath150 satisfies the corresponding system of integral equations .",
    "we show that this system of integral equation is invertible in the space @xmath151 and that the solution of the scattering problem is unique under some natural conditions on the eventual negative imaginary parts of the surface impedance .",
    "we divide the rest of the analysis into few steps :    1 .",
