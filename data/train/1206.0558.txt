    "oxygenic photosynthesis is currently the predominant source of energy for life on earth : @xmath2 to be more specific , oxygen molecules are generated by the transfer of electrons from water : @xmath3 where @xmath4 indicates a photon and @xmath5 specifies the @xmath5-photon process of the photosynthesis .",
    "terrestrial oxygenic photosynthesis has the @xmath6 photon process to utilize the main band frequency of the sunlight @xmath7 m ( photosynthetically active radiation ; par ) .",
    "the abiotic production of oxygen molecules is difficult since a main source of abiotic oxygen molecules on the earth , the direct photolysis of water molecules , is only effective for energetic photons in uv , @xmath8 nm @xcite .",
    "hence oxygen and ozone absorptions have been considered as the most promising biosignatures for the search for life on terrestrial exoplanets .",
    "space - based coronagraph missions proposed so far have been aimed at detecting the oxygen 0.76 @xmath0 m and 0.69 @xmath0 m bands from habitable planets mainly around g - type stars ( e.g. tpf - c * ? ? ?",
    "since it is difficult for space missions to utilize large telescope ( a @xmath9 4 m aperture is typically assumed ) , direct imaging of habitable planets around late - type stars is more challenging due to their small angular separation from the host star . on the other hand , 30 m class or larger ground - based telescopes",
    "have also been under consideration for next generation missions including the thirty meter telescope ( tmt ) , the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) and giant magellan telescope ( gmt ) .",
    "several detectors for direct imaging of exoplanets have been proposed for these telescopes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the advantages and disadvantages of the direct imaging of the ground - based telescope have been widely discussed so far ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . while several authors pointed out that the extreme adaptive optics ( exao ) has difficulty to achieve the contrast @xmath10 , which is not sufficient for the earth - like planet detection ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , several authors claimed that the postprocessing with exao can overcome the @xmath10 limit and achieve the contrast below @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , the contrast of a habitable earth - size planet around late - type star is much more favorable than that of g - type star ( @xmath12 ) , for instance , @xmath13 for late - type stars since the reflected - light luminosity is more or less constant among all habitable planets due to the temperature constraint , while the luminosity of stars differs by several orders of magnitude between spectral types .    for ground - based direct imaging , near - infrared ( nir ) observation",
    "is preferable over visible thanks to better exao performance .",
    "besides absorptions at visible bands , oxygen molecules also have the absorption feature in the nir band , at 1.27 @xmath0 m with a 0.02 @xmath0 m width , which is the second strongest absorption feature next to 0.76 @xmath0 m band .",
    "while the detectability of this band by ground - based telescope has been studied in the context of the transmission spectroscopy of exoplanets around late - type stars @xcite , it has not been considered in the context of the reflected light in detail .",
    "recently several missions to aim to detect the habitable planets around late - type stars have been proposed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the key concept to detect habitable planets from the ground is the combination of a coronagraph and subsequent post processing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although the key technology of exao , coronagraphs and post - processing have not yet demonstrated the performance level required to detect habitable planets , many proposed techniques are currently under development aiming toward reaching the photon noise limit .",
    "for instance , @xcite presented simulation results of the self coherent camera ( scc ) assuming e - elt and showed that the scc can achieve the photon noise limited when the magnitude is below @xmath14 mag for the h band .",
    "in addition , speckle nulling technique , which is not a post - processing method , is also a promising method to detect a habitable planet around a late - type star .",
    "hence it is crucial for astrobiology on exoplanets to know what kind of science at the habitable planet is possible by ground - based telescopes assuming that an idealistic photon - limited detection is reality in the near future .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the 1.27 @xmath0 m oxygen absorption band imprinted in reflection lights as a biomarker of oxygenic photosynthesis and examine its detectability with the above 30 - 40 m class telescopes ( extreme large telescopes ; elts ) with near - future idealistic instruments against the speckle noise .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first describe the outline of the absorption detection and clarify the main source of noise in  2 .",
    "in particular we estimate the intensity of the sky background by analyzing the real data of the sky on mauna kea .",
    "with several nearby star catalogs , we estimate the feasibility of the oxygen 1.27 @xmath0 m detection assuming an earth - twin at the inner edge of habitable zone ( ihz ) in  3 . in  4 , we discuss the availability of the stellar radiation to use the oxygenic photosynthesis for our sample .",
    "finally we summarize our results in  5 .",
    "the detectability of the planet itself and the detection of absorption lines are different .",
    "the former is in many cases dominated by the speckle noise from the leakage of the main star , as shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : scheme ] ( we use the term `` leakage '' to describe the contribution of the stellar psf halo throughout this paper ) .",

    "the sky background is expected to be uniform on the detector plane , and its non - uniformity and photon noise are negligible compared with the speckle noise . on the other hand , once the planet has been detected , the photon noise of the skybackground @xmath18 , the planet signal , and the leakage is the main source of the statistical error of the band detection ( right panel of figure [ fig : scheme ] ) . in this section ,",
    "we concentrate on the detectability on ground of the 1.27 @xmath0 m band assuming that planets themselves are detectable .",
    "we will discuss the relation between the detectability of planets and the oxygen band with the nearby star catalogue in  3 .",
    "here we summarize our observational strategy to detect biomarker absorption bands .",

    "the absorption feature of the spectra with @xmath70 km / s is slightly stronger than that with @xmath69 km / s .",
    "figure [ fig : at2 ] enlarges these three spectra around 1.27 @xmath0 m .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : at2 ] , the peculiar velocity of 20 km / s is larger than the typical width of each thin line , which displaces the planetary lines from the telluric lines .",

    "ninety seven stars ( 79 , 17 , and 1 for m , k and g stars ) for the photon - noise limited detector are above the 5 @xmath147 detection limit and almost all these stars ( 76 stars ) have s / n @xmath148 of the oxygen band detection . since the completeness of the m and k stars within 10 pc is high ( 96% and 86% ) , the number of the stars above the limit in our sample is close to the real value .    for reference , we also plot the 5 @xmath147 limit for currently proposed instruments .",
    "the dashed curve corresponds to the detection limit for the visible - light coronagraphic imaging polarimeter ifs ( near - infrared integral - field spectrograph ) for epics , though ifs assumes a 42 m telescope .",
    "we also show the 5 @xmath147 detection limit of epol ( the exoplanet polarimeter for epics ) at the e - elt for reference although the j - band is not used for epol .",

    "filled circles indicate the candidates with detection s / n @xmath150 for a photon - noise limit ( 1 hour observation ) on tmt and with the star - planet angular separation larger than 8.7 mas .",
    "the vertical line is the approximate detection limit of the photon - noise limited detector for 1 hour exposure .",
    "the lower panel shows the signal - to - noise ratio on the angular separation - the planet - star contrast .",
    "the 5 @xmath147 detection limits for the photon - noise limited detector , ifs and epol for epics / e - elt are shown by solid , dashed , and dotted lines @xcite .",
    "[ fig : snbio ] ]    in this paper , we do not take single / binary stars into consideration since the information about it is quite incomplete for the catalog we use . for m and k subdwarfs ,",
    "the estimated values of the binary fraction are around 30 % : @xmath151 % @xcite , @xmath152 % @xcite , @xmath153 % @xcite and references therein .",
    "since direct imaging of planets around binary stars is difficult , we should multiply our expected number of the detectable planets by 0.7 .",
    "hence we conclude that planets around @xmath154 single stars are above the 5 @xmath147 detection limit and @xmath155 of these have s / n @xmath148 for the oxygen band detection .",
    "so far , we have discussed the feasibility of the oxygen absorption assuming the planet is already detected .",
    "however , it is valuable to consider an absorption feature of the planet candidate below 5 @xmath147 detection since absorption feature itself increases the confidence level of the planet detection .",
    "statistically , the combination of both the 3 @xmath147 planet detection and the 3 @xmath147 absorption detection provides almost the same probability as a 5 @xmath147 detection .",
    "while this situation may be less reliable than the 5 @xmath147 planet detect alone , the planet search with spectral anomaly such as the absorption feature will be useful for large telescopes with good photon statistics . indeed the simultaneous differential imaging ( sdi ) technique has been implemented on several instruments , which utilize the 1.6 @xmath0 m methane absorption feature for identification of gas giants ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite tested a non - simultaneous spectral differential imaging technique ( nsdi ) which utilize the oxygen 0.76 @xmath0 m absorption , assuming observation of an earth - like planet from space . since the 1.27 @xmath0 m oxygen feature is the strongest in j , h , and k bands except for water of the earth reflection @xcite , the utilization of this band to detect the earth - like planet is reasonable",
    "in this paper , we have considered habitable planets with the oxygenic environment created by oxygenic photosynthetic organisms .",
    "although the probability of the emergence of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms is extremely difficult to evaluate , we can compare available energy of nearby detectable stars to use the photosynthesis with that on the earth .",
    "since the photosynthesis process on the earth reduces the photon energy to the specific excitation energy at the center of the reaction via the light harvesting antenna , the availability of photon energy by the photosynthetic organism is quantified by the photon flux , not by the energy flux , of the par , known as the photosynthetic photon flux density ( ppfd ) . since the excitation energy at the reaction center is @xmath156 @xmath0 m , the par is defined in the range of 0.4 - 0.7 @xmath0 m for the oxygenic photosynthesis on the earth .",
    "the ppfd of the habitable planet around late - type stars is a half to a tenth of that of the earth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we compute the ppfd for the detectable planets by the photon - noise limited detector in our sample indicated in figure [ fig : snbio ] .",
    "while @xcite have argued the possibility to extend the energy to redder to obtain much energy on the planet around the late - type stars , which might need to the 3-photon process to obtain enough energy to make oxygen molecules from water , we conservatively take the same range as terrestrial oxygenic photosynthesis ( 0.4 - 0.7 @xmath0 m ) . since the central wavelength of the v - band 0.55 @xmath0 m is also the center of the range of the ppfd",
    ", we extrapolate the v - band magnitude to the par and compute the ppfd .",
    "if the v - band magnitude is not available , we estimate the ppfd assuming the planck distribution although the visible magnitude is systematically smaller than that expected from the black body radiation for the late - type star @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : snbio ] , the ppfd of most detectable planets by the photon - noise limited detector is around 10 - 40 % that of the earth , which is not significantly low for the oxygenic photosynthesis .",
    "we adopt the ppfd of the earth from table a5 of @xcite with the distance correction ( from the ihz to 1 au ) .",
    "the ppfd we computed is the one at the top of the atmosphere , not the one at the planetary surface , which the organism can use .",
    "cloud coverage and optical depth are also important to determine the ppfd at the planetary surface .",
    "these might depend on many factors , such as the spin rotation period , water content , surface temperature and so on .",
    "observationally , if the planet is tidally unlocked , the photometric variation can be used to estimate the cloud coverage @xcite or even mapping the cloud distribution @xcite . for tidally locked planet",
    ", the cloud coverage for the illuminated side might be larger than that of the earth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , availability of the photosynthetic light on planets around the late - type star is still an open question for both aspects of cloud formation and methodology to estimate for tidally locked planets .",
    "we did not consider detectability of other important biomarkers including @xmath157 in this paper .",
    "the detection of oxygen with reductant such as methane might support the evidence of the existence of exo - life . in this case",
    ", methane does not have to be biotic molecules .",
    "it proves that there exists some mechanism which continuously produces oxygen , since oxygen is consumed in the oxidation of methane .",
    "while methane on the current earth is more challenging to detect , @xcite showed that uv photochemical process significantly enhances the absorption of methane for habitable planets around late - type stars ( figure 8 in their paper ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the detectability of methane is complex because the methane is minor component in the current earth ( but oxygen is not the case ) . since the issue that abiotic production of oxygen is still under debate",
    ", we do not consider the methane detection in this paper .",
    "the practical problem is that we can no longer adopt the simple estimate of @xmath143 since these lines are not in the middle of bands and , have wider wavelength range .",
    "we will consider detectability of these biomarkers by generalizing the method in the next paper .",
    "in this paper , the detectability of oxygen absorption , as a biomarker from habitable planets , by ground - based telescopes has been examined . analyzing real data of the night sky",
    ", we showed that the telluric oxygen emission as the strong sky background is damped by an order of magnitude during a night . with nearby star catalogs , which is almost complete for m and k stars within 10 pc",
    ", we found that the oxygen 1.27 @xmath0 m absorption band is detectable with future photon noise limited instruments and 30 - 40 m telescopes for planets around dozens to hundreds late - type stars assuming an earth - twin at the inner habitable zone around the stars .",
    "photosynthetic photon flux density of these planets is not significantly low , 10%-40% of that on the earth .",
    "we conclude that extremely large telescopes in the near future will enable us to search for the signature of oxygenic photosynthesis on the habitable planets around the late - type stars .",
    "this paper demonstrates the importance of deploying small iwa ( @xmath158 ) efficient coronagraph + exao on elts , and clearly shows that doing so will enable study of potentially habitable planets .",
