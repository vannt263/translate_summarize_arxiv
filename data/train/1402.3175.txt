    "the functional @xmath23 is nonnegative , equals zero if and only if @xmath24 , and is jointly convex in its arguments @xcite .    for a probability distribution @xmath25 and a set of distributions @xmath26 , the i - projection @xcite of @xmath25 onto @xmath26",
    "is defined as the unique minimizer ( if it exists ) of the functional @xmath27 over all @xmath28 .",
    "we shall study here i - projections as mappings between sets of the form @xmath16 .",
    "namely , let @xmath29 be defined by : @xmath30 ( above and in the sequel we assume that @xmath31 and @xmath32 . ) the definition is slightly imprecise in that @xmath33 can be undefined for some @xmath34 , i.e. , the domain of @xmath35 can in fact be a proper subset of @xmath36 .",
    "this is overlooked for notational simplicity .",
    "another simplification is the omission of the dependence of the functional @xmath35 on @xmath37 ; this will not cause any ambiguities .    note that @xmath33 is undefined only when @xmath38 for all @xmath39 .",
    "if @xmath40 for some @xmath39 , then existence of @xmath33 follows easily from the properties of @xmath41 and the convexity of @xmath42 @xcite . therefore , @xmath33 exists if and only if there exists @xmath39 with @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore , it is clear that the i - projection is defined for all @xmath34 if and only if it is defined for all vertices of @xmath36 .",
    "the vertices of transportation polytopes are uniquely determined by their supports and can be characterized as follows : @xmath44 is a vertex of @xmath36 if and only if the associated bipartite graph @xmath45 with  left \" nodes @xmath1 ,  right \" nodes @xmath46 , and edges @xmath47 , is a forest , i.e. , contains no cycles @xcite .",
    "in fact , every face of the polytope @xmath36 is determined by its support @xcite .",
    "apart from identifying faces , the condition for two vertices being adjacent can also be expressed in terms of supports , as can many other geometric and combinatorial properties of transportation polytopes ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "this motivates the following definition .",
    "we say that the polytopes @xmath36 and @xmath41 are _ geometrically equivalent _ if for every @xmath34 there exists @xmath39 with @xmath48 , and vice versa .",

    "to give an example of two geometrically equivalent transportation polytopes , consider some @xmath36 that is generic ( nondegenerate ) @xcite , implying that the bipartite graphs defining its vertices are spanning trees , and assume that @xmath53 has only two masses ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "in this case for every vertex @xmath49 , @xmath45 has @xmath55 edges and therefore necessarily contains edges @xmath56 and @xmath57 for some @xmath58 ( fig .  [ fig_graph ] ) .     and @xmath59 .",
    "]    then it is not hard to see that @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , has vertices with identical supports as those of @xmath36 , for small enough @xmath62 .",

    "the following claim is straightforward .",
    "if @xmath36 and @xmath41 are geometrically equivalent , then they are combinatorially equivalent , i.e. , they have isomorphic face lattices . @xmath63",
    "it is easy to see from the above discussion that @xmath35 maps the vertices of @xmath64 to the vertices of @xmath65 . in the study of probability distributions with fixed marginals",
    "there are two particularly important vertices called frchet - hoeffding ( f - h for short ) upper and lower bounds @xcite .",
    "both of them are uniquely determined by their supports , namely , @xmath66 is the f - h upper bound for the family @xmath67 if and only if its associated bipartite graph has no crossings ( when the nodes @xmath68 on the left and @xmath69 on the right are drawn in increasing order , see fig .  [ fig_graph ] ) , while @xmath70 is the f - h lower bound if and only if its associated graph , after reversing the order of the `` right '' nodes , has no crossings ( in other words , the support of the lower bound for @xmath67 is the same as that of the upper bound for @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the inverse permutation of @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath73 ) .",
