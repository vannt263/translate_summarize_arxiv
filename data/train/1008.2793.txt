    "radiation pressure , poynting - robertson drag , and stellar winds can remove these particles on timescales much less than the age of the star .",
    "thus , seeing a debris disk means that either a major collision of large objects has recently occurred in the system , or that the dust is continually replenished through collisions within a reservoir of smaller bodies .",
    "either way , these disks signify the presence of some kind of planetary system . they also offer the chance to view a system of planetesimals for signs of unseen planets or very - low - mass companions by way of central clearings , gaps , localized clumps , or spiral arms caused by planetary perturbations on the disk structure .",
    "an increasing number of debris disks are being resolved , especially around solar - type stars .",
    "infrared measurements from the _ iras _ , _ iso _ , and _ spitzer _",
    "space telescopes have been used to identify disk candidates based on far - infrared flux densities well in excess of those expected for stellar photospheres .",
    "a few have been resolved in long - wavelength emission with _",
    "spitzer _ and submillimeter radio telescopes . such disks , like those around @xmath9 pictoris ( heap et al .",
    "2000 ) or fomalhaut ( kalas et al .",
    "2005 ) , have low optical depths that make them difficult to image in scattered light relative to the glare created by the stars and telescope .",
    "high contrast imaging techniques are required , including a coronagraph to suppress the diffraction pattern of the star and point spread function ( psf ) subtraction to reduce the residual instrumentally - scattered light .",
    "while ground - based observations use these methods , the lack of wavefront stability due to atmospheric turbulence , even after correction by adaptive optics , precludes them from detecting all but the brightest debris disks .",
    "this is largely due to image instabilities that lead to significant psf subtraction residuals .",
    "the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) avoids this problem entirely and provides a highly stable wavefront , making it the premier tool for debris disk imaging at visible wavelengths .",
    "the coronagraph on the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) provided the highest contrast imaging capability on _ hst _ ( krist 2004 ) until its failure in early 2007 .    by showing the location of orbiting planetesimals and , in some cases , by identifying disk asymmetries caused by individual planets , debris disk images",

    "for the most direct comparison with the solar system , debris disks around mature solar - type stars are of particular interest .",
    "we consider here the nearby sun - like star hd 207129 ( hr 8323 , hip 107649 , gj 838 , iras 21450 - 4732 ; @xmath10=5.58 ) , a g0v star at a hipparcos - measured distance of 16.0 pc ( van leeuwen 2007 ) .",
    "walker & wolstencroft ( 1988 ) noted that hd 207129 had a small _ iras _",
    "60 @xmath2 m excess while habing et al .",
    "( 1996 ) measured 60 and 90 @xmath2 m _ iso _ excesses , indications of circumstellar material , most likely a disk .",
    "jourdain de muizon et al .",
    "( 1999 ) obtained additional _",
    "observations over @xmath1 = 2.5  180 @xmath2 m and verified that there was no significant excess below 25 @xmath2 m .",
    "this indicates the lack of circumstellar material near the star and thus a central clearing in the disk .",
    "they suggested that a substellar companion interior to the clearing may be required to maintain the hole as poynting - robertson drag would cause dust to migrate towards the star and fill it on short timescales .",
    "sheret , dent , & wyatt ( 2004 ) were unable to detect the disk at @xmath1 = 450 and 850 @xmath2 m using scuba .",
    "using the submillimeter non - detections as upper limits and combining the _ iras _ and _ iso _ results , they derived a disk radius of @xmath11 au .",
    "however , zuckerman & song ( 2004 ) derived a 35 au orbital radius by assuming that large dust grains emit as a blackbody at t@xmath550 k. this highlights a problem with determining disk sizes from unresolved photometric measurements : degeneracies exist among the grain size , emissivity , temperature , and distance from the star , and thus the size scale of the disk is uncertain .",
    "for example , see the analysis of the hd 12039 disk by hines et al .",
    "by directly measuring the location of the dust , resolved images of the disk can break these degeneracies and allow reliable grain properties to be derived .    in an effort to increase the number of resolved debris disks",
    ", we utilized the acs coronagraph to image disk candidate stars selected based on their infrared excesses measured with the _ iras _ , _ iso _ , and _ spitzer _ space telescopes .",
    "most disk candidates with higher optical depths ( implied by @xmath12 ) have previously been imaged by _",
    "hst _ and ground - based telescopes . to date , the lowest optical depth disk seen in scattered light is fomalhaut s ( kalas et al .",
    "2005 ) , which has @xmath13 .",
    "we chose eight targets previously unobserved by _ hst _ having @xmath14 = 17 @xmath15 , including hd 207129 .",
    "we report here the detection of a disk around that star and , as an appendix , non - detections around six of the other targets ( the detection of the disk around hd 10647 is discussed in stapelfeldt et al . in preparation ) .",
    "hd 207129 was observed on 3 may 2006 with the coronagraph in the acs high resolution camera ( hrc ; @xmath50025 pixel@xmath16 ) in _ hst _ program 10539 .",
    "two observation sequences were executed , each consisting of a 0.1s exposure in the narrowband filter f502n for automated acquisition and centering of the star behind the coronagraphic occulting spot , and a 100s exposure and four 520s exposures in f606w with the star centered behind the 18-diameter occulter . at the beginning of the first sequence , two 0.3s direct ( non - coronagraphic )",
    "exposures in filter f606w ( acs wide-@xmath10 band ) were taken to provide unsaturated images for accurate stellar photometry .",
    "each sequence required one orbit , and the two sequences were executed in consecutive orbits . between them ,",
    "the telescope was rolled 20.0about the line of sight to provide additional discrimination between real objects and instrumental artifacts ( instrumental artifacts appear stationary on the detector while the sky image rotates ) .",
    "while the coronagraph suppresses the diffraction pattern created by the telescope , it does not reduce the scattering by optical surface errors that create a halo of light around the star .",
    "this halo is typically subtracted using an image of another isolated star observed in the same manner .",
    "this is practical because the _ hst _ psf is generally stable over time ( compared to ground - based telescopes ) .",
    "the g3v star hd 211415 ( @xmath10=5.33 ) was observed in the orbit following the two hd 207129 orbits to provide a reference psf .",
    "it was selected because it has a similar color to hd 207129 and is nearby in the sky .",
    "unfortunately our images showed the presence of a companion star located 22 away at pa=43.2and 4.5 mag fainter 100 au . ] . in the coronagraphic images ,",
    "the companion is highly saturated , rendering these images unsuitable for use for psf subtraction .",
    "as will be described later , an alternative subtraction method was used instead .",
    "the acs images were calibrated by the _ hst _ pipeline .",
    "multiple long exposures were combined and cosmic rays rejected .",
    "image count rates were converted to standard @xmath10 magnitudes using the zero point obtained from the synphot synthetic photometry program based on a stellar spectrum of similar type to hd 207129 .",
    "as previously noted , the designated psf subtraction reference star , hd 211415 , was a binary . to replace it ,",
    "ten similarly - observed alternative reference stars were collected from our program and the @xmath4 archive .",
    "each was subtracted from the combined long exposure hd 207129 images .",
    "this was done by iteratively shifting the reference image via interpolation , adjusting its normalization , and subtracting it from the science image until the residual instrumental halo was minimized by eye .",
    "none of these subtractions indicated the presence of any circumstellar material above the level of the residuals , and they are therefore of no further use . using these reference stars was not optimal because the telescope focus and the coronagraphic occulter position are known to vary over time , and this selection of reference stars was not matched in color with hd 207129 as hd 211415 had been .",
    "these differences between the psf reference stars and the science target can cause significant subtraction residuals .",
    "the only viable alternative processing technique was to use the image of hd 207129 taken at one orientation to subtract the starlight from the image taken at the other and vice - versa , a process called roll subtraction . because the images were taken close in time ,",
    "this reduces the effects of time - dependent changes in the telescope , and there is no color mismatch .",
    "however , any extended disk could subtract part of itself in the other orientation , thus this method is best suited to nebulosity that is confined along a preferred axis through the star , such as an edge - on disk ( a symmetric face - on disk would completely subtract itself , for example ) .",
    "a roll - subtracted image contains a positive image of a disk and a negative one rotated by an angle equal to the difference between the telescope orientations .",
    "ideally , these two would be combined to form a single , positive image , but that is difficult to do after subtraction . instead of directly subtracting images from the two orientations and then trying to combine the results , an iterative technique can be used that solves for those portions of the two unsubtracted images that appear static on the detector ( @xmath17  the psf ) and those that appear to rotate as the telescope rolls ( @xmath17 the sky , including any disk ) .",
    "such a method was used to subtract the _",
    "hst _ stis images of @xmath9 pictoris ( heap et al .",
    "2000 ) , whose edge - on disk is well - suited for this .",
    "the procedure begins with an initial estimate of the static ( psf ) component , which is the average of the unsubtracted ( raw ) images ( it is assumed that the psf is largely stable between the two observations ) . at this point ,",
    "any rotating ( sky ) features from each orientation in this static image are now half of their original intensities compared to the total static component .",
    "this estimate of the static component is then subtracted from each raw image , creating the initial sky estimate at each orientation .",
    "one of the sky frames is then rotated to the orientation of the other , and the two are then averaged .",
    "this new sky frame is then subtracted from each raw frame ( after rotation ) , and the result is averaged , creating a new static estimate . in each subsequent iteration , the residual sky features in the estimated static ( psf ) component are reduced in intensity by a factor of two .",
    "this process is repeated until the sky frame does not visibly change .",
    "the above method was applied to the long - exposure hd 207129 data . before doing so",
    ", the images from the two roll angles were shifted via interpolation to a common center , to remove small residual pointing offsets between the two .",
    "the subtraction procedure was then run for eight iterations .",
    "the result revealed a very faint , inclined ring centered on the star . to improve the signal ,",
    "the original images were downsampled to 01 resolution using 4@xmath184 rebinning and the subtraction process repeated with improved results ( figure 1 ) .    to verify that the subtraction algorithm can produce a reliable result ,",
    "we have tested our detection procedure on a simulated disk image combined with an observed acs coronagraphic psf . for the star we used acs images of hd 82943 , which was also observed in our program with sequences similar to those for hd 207129 . a noiseless model of the hd 207129 ring with twice its surface brightness relative to the star was added at each orientation and then processed .",
    "the results shown in figure 2 indicate that this method can reliably extract such a disk from these data .",
    "another experiment with the disk model having a filled interior but otherwise the same inclination and size showed that the extracted disk image also had a filled interior , so the inner clearing in the real disk is not caused by self - subtraction .",
    "it is unlikely that this disk would have been detected by subtracting a reference star image , as we had originally intended with hd 211415 .",
    "there is always a psf mismatch due to color differences when a reference psf is used .",
    "this disk is so faint that it might have been detected only by using roll subtraction and avoiding such color mismatches .",
    "the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ) instrument was used to image hd 207129 at 24 @xmath2 m on 13 october 2004 as a part of gto program 41 ( beichman et al . 2005 ) .",
    "one cycle of the standard photometry dither pattern was executed , producing a dataset with 16@xmath183s exposures .",
    "mosaics with 245 square pixels from the spitzer science center ( ssc ) post - bcd pipeline version 14.4 ( providing enhanced processing beyond the basic calibrated data ) were used for our analysis .",

    "five cycles of the small field photometry dither pattern and 10 sec exposures were made at each of 4 cluster target positions spaced on a square grid of 1622 ( 3.16-pixel ) spacing .",

    "photometry of the fine scale data using a 15 pixel square aperture , with an aperture correction derived from stinytim psf simulations ( krist 2006 ) , finds 70 @xmath2 m flux densities ranging from 244 - 317 mjy , depending on where the background is chosen .",
    "the midpoint of these values is consistent with the flux density of 289 mjy reported for the default scale data by trilling et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and is much brighter than the stellar photospheric emission .",
    "however , reprocessing of the default scale data using the most recent mips instrument team pipeline produces images with a smoother background and fewer artifacts .",

    "hd 207129 is a red source , a color correction factor of 1.12 ( assuming a color temperature of 50 k ) must be applied to yield a final 70 @xmath2 m flux density of 413 @xmath19 29 mjy .",
    "mips 160 @xmath2 m observations were carried out on 04 jun 2007 as a part of go program 30157 .",

    "the total exposure time on the source was @xmath20 = 1728 seconds .",
    "data processing was again with the mips dat ver 3.10 , with the final product being a 130@xmath1858 pixel mosaic at 4pixel scale .",
    "the short - wavelength spectral leak is present adjacent to the image of hd 207129 , with intensity about half of the true source brightness .",
    "this spurious source was removed by aligning and subtracting an image of @xmath21 ceti , an object for which mips detects only the spectral leak at 160 @xmath2 m .",
    "photometry of the leak - subtracted image is also complicated by variable background levels near the source .",
    "depending on the sky aperture placement , background - subtracted flux densities in a 16 pixel square aperture range from 218 to 283 mjy , with a 12% overall calibration uncertainty .",
    "we therefore adopt a compromise value of 250 @xmath19 40 mjy for the source at 160 @xmath2 m .",
    "this is somewhat larger than the value derived by tanner et al .",
    "( 2009 ) from a different mips dataset , and is about 30% less than the value obtained from isophot observations by jourdain de muizon ( 1999 ) - probably because of source confusion in the large iso beam ( see section [ sec : spit ] ) .",

    "this was then boxcar - smoothed over 5 adjacent rows to improve the measured signal to noise ratio . to extract the spectrum ,",
    "the signal in 5 columns centered on the peak emission was summed along each row of the sed mosaic . the resulting spectrum in instrumental units",
    "was converted to physical units by reducing and extracting a mips spectrum of the calibration star canopus ( f0 ii ) in the same way .",
    "the canopus spectrum was re - normalized to give a flux density of 3.11 jy at 70 @xmath2 m , and corrected for the spectral response function by assuming canopus has a rayleigh - jeans spectral slope in the far - ir .",
    "the flux normalization and spectral response function derived from canopus were then applied to the mips spectrum of hd 207129 , and the resultant spectrum was further smoothed over adjacent wavelength bins .",
    "this reduction process assumes a point source slit loss correction ; a revised slit loss correction becomes necessary when fitting spatially extended source models to these data ( section [ sec : model ] ) .    _",

    "the resulting flux is an average of these two nod positions , while the error bars are calculated from the difference between them .",
    "the entrance slit for the sl spectrograph is just 37 wide , resulting in potential loss of some incoming flux depending on how well centered the target is within the slit .",
    "the long - low slit width of 106 is much less prone to pointing - related slit loss .",
    "this is confirmed by comparison with the mips photometry , where the irs flux density at 24 @xmath2 m ( 165 mjy ) is in excellent agreement with the aforementioned mips 24 @xmath2 m value , and well within the nominal @xmath52% calibration uncertainty for mips at 24@xmath2 m ( engelbracht et al .",
    "due to slit loss , however , the sl data had to be scaled upward by a constant factor of 1.08 in order to properly overlap with the ll data . following this scaling , data from the three spectral orders were spliced together by simple removal of the low s / n edges of each order , resulting in a final wavelength coverage from 7.6 - 35 @xmath2 m . here also , a point source slit loss correction is assumed and must be revised when modeling an extended source ( section [ sec : model ] ) .",

    "the grain size distribution is at first assumed to follow an a@xmath26 power law appropriate to a collisional cascade ( dohnanyi 1969 ) , but other slopes are considered .",
    "initial values for the ring geometrical parameters are taken from the @xmath4 image ( section [ sec : hstdata ] ) .",
    "model thermal images are then calculated for this dust distribution on a 1spatial grid for 31 wavelengths spanning 10 - 850 @xmath2 m .",
    "the total flux in these 31 channels is compared to the sed of the infrared excess emission , while appropriate subsets of model images are combined to synthesize broad - band images as observed by the mips 24 , 70 , and 160 @xmath2 m cameras .",

    "a model scattered light image is calculated for the same dust density distribution on a spatial grid of 1 , with the dust albedo and phase function asymmetry parameter as additional inputs .",
    "isotropic scattering is assumed .",
    "comparison of model spectra to the observations requires careful consideration of slit losses . the irs and mips",
    "sed data are normally calibrated with slit loss corrections appropriate to a point source , with the goal of making their flux calibration consistent with large - aperture mips 24 and 70 @xmath2 m photometry . for a spatially",
    "extended source such as the ring of hd 207129 , a point - source slit loss correction is no longer appropriate for calibration of these spectra .",
    "the true slit loss correction will depend in detail on the specific source brightness distribution , which is model - dependent .",
    "rather than derive slit loss corrections and recalibrate the spectral data for each possible model sed , we choose to compare model spectra that have suffered uncorrected slit losses to a version of the _ spitzer _ data that has had its point - source slit loss correction removed .",
    "slit loss correction factors for the irs sl and ll data were derived using the irs cubism software v1.6 ( smith et al .",

    "we seek a global model that can reproduce the infrared photometry , spectroscopy , resolved source size at 70 @xmath2 m , and the scattered light brightness seen in the @xmath4 image . with its superior spatial resolution ,",
    "the acs coronagraphic image fixes the radial location of the dust within the 148178 au region , as well as the ring inclination and position angle .",
    "an optimal model for the _ spitzer _ data was sought manually by varying the normal optical depth and the minimum / maximum silicate grain radii a@xmath24 and a@xmath25 .",
    "our initial guess for a@xmath24 was 0.6 @xmath2 m , the geometric blowout size for grains with density 2.5 gm @xmath27 , stellar luminosity of 1.2 , and stellar mass of 1.1 ( equation a19 of plavchan et al .",

    "the model reproduces the observed fwhm of the source at 70 @xmath2 m ; the slightly smaller source diameter at 70 @xmath2 m , relative to the ring seen in scattered light , can be understood by the warmest emission being concentrated at the ring inner edge .",
    "integrating over the grain size distribution , and assuming a mean grain density of 2.5 gm @xmath27 , the total dust surface density is 4@xmath29 gm cm@xmath7 at r@xmath28 160 au . and",
    "the dust mass in the model integrated over the full spatial extent of the ring is 0.07 lunar masses .",
    "a sharp ring inner edge provides a good match to the steeply rising excess emission beyond 30 @xmath2 m , and the lack of scattered light emission inside radii of 148 au .",
    "we found that the nominal -3.5 power law slope caused the model to over - predict the 160 @xmath2 m flux density relative to 70 @xmath2 m . by steepening the grain size distribution to a -3.9 power law",
    ", an adequate fit is obtained .",
    "this change strongly suppresses the submillimeter flux from the model ; to compensate , a larger value of a@xmath31 700 @xmath2 m is adopted . a slope @xmath32@xmath333.7 is compatible with the measurements within the errors .",
    "this slope is preferred by recent numerical simulations of the equilibrium grain size distribution when material strength effects are considered ( a. gspr , in preparation ) .",
    "while this model provides a good fit to the available photometry and the spectrophotometry measured through the irs and mips sed slits , it fails in its predicted scattered light brightness . according to mie theory , astronomical silicate grains larger than 1 @xmath2 m radius should have an albedo @xmath34 q@xmath35/(q@xmath36 + q@xmath35 ) of @xmath555% in the optical and near - infrared .",
    "this value was assumed in the thermal equilibrium calculations intrinsic to the sed model .",
    "for this value , and integrating over the grain size distribution of our preferred model , the model ring is much brighter in scattered light than the @xmath4-measured surface brightness on the ring ansae .",
    "the fraction of the stellar luminosity scattered by the grains , relative to the total luminosity incident on the grains , provides a wavelength - averaged albedo that can be estimated from the available data :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the fractional scattered light luminosity of the disk ( relative to direct starlight ) , and @xmath39 is the fractional infrared luminosity of the disk = 1.4@xmath15 from the _ spitzer _ data .",
    "@xmath38 is estimated from the @xmath4 images by renormalizing our scattered light model image of the ring so that its surface brightness on the ansa matches the observed value , and then adding up the total scattered light in the model ring structure .",
    "the result finds that @xmath40 7.6@xmath29 . to the extent that this value , measured at 0.6 @xmath2 m , is representative of the fraction of scattered to direct starlight averaged over the wavelengths that produce significant stellar heating of the grains ,",
    "the mean albedo of the dust particles would be @xmath41 .",
    "simple mie theory grains are thus not consistent with the combined suite of observations for hd 207129 .    when the sed modeling is repeated using this reduced albedo , but retaining the original mie values for q@xmath35 , a very similar model is obtained where the only required change is that @xmath42 increases to 2.8 @xmath2 m .",
    "the higher grain emissivity causes larger grains to come to the same equilibrium temperature as the smaller , more reflective grains initially assumed . in making this adjustment ,",
    "we have retained the emissive properties of astronomical silicate grains but modified their reflectivity : essentially painting the grains black .",
    "porous dust grains might account for this results , as they are thought to have lower albedoes ( hage and greenberg 1990 ) and larger blowout sizes ( saija et al .",
    "2003 ) in comparison to solid grains made from the same material .",
    "the best matching sed model with the modified grain albedo is shown in figure 5 .",
    "future work will be needed to assess what combination of grain properties and scattering theory can provide a self - consistent solution to the emissivity and albedo values we found necessary to fit the optical and infrared properties of the hd 207129 ring .",
    "hd 207129 joins the small but growing list of stars that have resolved debris disks imaged in scattered light , which as of the time of writing number nearly 20 .",
    "the ring - like appearance of its disk is similar to those of hr 4796 and fomalhaut , whose central cleared zones suggest the presence of low mass substellar companions that tidally remove dust .",
    "the most prominent example of this behavior is the fomalhaut ring ( quillen 2006 ; chiang et al .",
    "2009 ) , which is eccentric , has a sharp inner edge , and for which the predicted companion has been subsequently imaged ( kalas et al .",
    "the low definition of the hd 207129 ring makes it difficult to measure its properties precisely .",
    "a sharp ring inner edge is indicated by the steeply rising excess emission beyond 30 @xmath2 m , and is consistent with the absence of scattered light inside a radius of 150 au .",
    "a planet sculpting the ring may lie just inside this radius , but no field objects are seen there in our coronagraphic images .",
    "the point source projected near the s outer edge of the ring could be relevant to the ring dynamics , if it was found to be a co - moving member of the system .",
    "its brightness in f606w would correspond to a > 20 m@xmath43 brown dwarf , according to the spectral evolutionary model of burrows , sudarsky , and lunine ( 2003 ) .    to constrain a possible offset of the ring center from the star , we visually overlaid ellipses on the ring image ( figure 6 ) to fit for the ring center .",
    "we find that any offset of the star from the ring center must be smaller than 0.4and 0.2along the ring minor and major axes ( respectively ) .",
    "the corresponding upper limit to any ring eccentricity is 0.08 , for the case where the line of apsides would be projected farthest from the plane of the sky .        the low signal of the hd 207129 ring in the acs images limits our measurement accuracy and",
    "thus only rough characteristics can be derived .",
    "the lack of a significant difference in brightness in the near and far sides of the ring indicates nearly - isotropic scattering .",
    "based on comparisons to our approximate ring models ( figure 7 ) , we constrain the asymmetry parameter , @xmath44 , of the henyey - greenstein scattering phase function to be @xmath45 .",
    "this low level of forward scattering is only matched by the disk of hd 92945 ( golimowski et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "other debris disks , like fomalhaut ( kalas et al .",
    "2005 ) , hd 141569a ( clampin et al .",
    "2003 ) , au mic ( krist et al . 2005 ) , and hd 107146 ( ardila et al . 2004 ) have more forward scattering ( @xmath46 ) .    .",
    "these demonstrate by comparison that the actual ring does not have significantly forward scattering ( large @xmath44 ) grains .",
    "all images are displayed with linear intensity stretches between their minimum and maximum values . ]    the nearly isotropic scattering in the ring conflicts with any assumption of spherical particles that scatter according to mie theory .",
    "our combined scattering+sed modeling indicates that the minimum grain size is @xmath52.8 @xmath2 m .",
    "spherical 2.8@xmath2 m particles are predicted to be strongly forward scattering for wavelengths less than the grain size ( @xmath47 0.8 at @xmath48 m ) .",
    "if such grains were present in the hd 207129 ring , then the foreground portion of the ring should appear much brighter than the ansae or back side .",
    "this effect is not seen in the @xmath4 images . in mie theory ,",
    "astronomical silicate grains with characteristic radius @xmath49 0.05 @xmath2 m would be needed to match this result , and would appear much warmer than the @xmath5 44 k temperature that characterizes the spectral energy distribution . combined with the low derived albedo",
    ", this result points to non - spherical , possibly porous or coated grains .",
    "previous estimates for the age of hd 207129 have ranged from as little as 30 - 40 myrs ( zuckerman , song , & webb 2001 ) to as high as 4.4  8.3 gyrs ( lachaume et al .",

    "the very young age estimate has been withdrawn , but an age as young as 600 myrs is still suggested ( song , zuckerman , & bessell 2003,2004 ) . a recent recalibration of the dependence of chromospheric activity on stellar age suggests an age of 2.1 gyrs ( mamajek & hillenbrand 2008 ) based on its ca ii emission strength of log @xmath50= -4.8 ( henry et al .",
    "this is consistent with an age estimated based on li abundances measured by soderblom ( 1985 ) .",
    "however , the x - ray luminosity of this source ( 1.5@xmath51 erg sec@xmath16 , based on the rosat source counts and a nominal spectrum ) is considerably larger than typical for members of the ngc 752 cluster at age 1.9 gyrs ( giardino et al .",
    "an age of 1 gyr is plausible .",
    "the detection of this disk in scattered light is rather fortuitous .",
    "as measured by its 10@xmath52 fractional emission luminosity , it is among the lowest dust content disks to have been imaged .",
    "if the material were more widely distributed radially around the star ( such as in the case of @xmath9 pic ) instead of concentrated in a ring , its surface brightness would be significantly reduced .",
    "in addition , if the star were 30 pc away rather than @xmath515 pc , the disk would appear half as far from the star and would be lost in the greater glare and psf subtraction residuals that exist there .",
    "the star is also bright enough ( @xmath10=5.6 ) for sufficient scattered light to be detected .",
    "these same conditions apply for fomalhaut ( @xmath0=7.7 pc , @xmath10=1.2 ) , which has a somewhat lower fractional excess ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "these examples highlight the considerations required when optimizing a target list for coronagraphic observations , especially given the limited observing resources on @xmath4 in both time and coronagraphic performance .",
    "targets that are too far away and have too low an excess are poor candidates with little chance of a detection .",
    "@xmath4 coronagraphic images detect the debris disk of hd 207129 as a narrow ring with radius 160 au , significantly smaller than previous estimates based only on analysis of the source sed .",
    "the ring size and orientation are comparable to that inferred from resolved mips images of the source at 70 @xmath2 m .",
    "this ring is among the faintest circumstellar features ever detected with @xmath4 , and was only reliably extracted from stellar psf artifacts through the use of a roll self - subtraction technique .    given the new definition of the system geometry , we fit a model to the _ spitzer _ images and spectrophotometry .",
    "we find that the observed emission is consistent with material in the single radial zone where @xmath4 detects scattered light , and with dust grains ranging from 2.8 @xmath2 m to at least 500 @xmath2 m radius .",
    "however , the almost isotropic scattering properties and low albedo of the ring particles are not consistent with simple mie theory estimates for silicate grain composition .",
    "the narrowness of the ring , its apparently sharp inner edge , and large central cleared region are similar to the fomalhaut system , and suggest that deep near - ir imaging searches for substellar / planetary companions might be profitable in the hd 207129 system .",
    "further observations with _ herschel _ could refine the ring emission properties for a more detailed comparison to the @xmath4 images , while far - ir spectroscopy might provide some better indication of the dust composition .",
    "in addition to hd 207129 , we observed seven other debris disks selected from _ spitzer _ results to have fractional infrared luminosities @xmath54 .",
    "the disk of hd 10647 ( distance @xmath28 17 pc ) was detected and will be reported in stapelfeldt et al .",

    "the other six are listed in table [ tab : targs ] .",
    "none of these showed scattered light at the contrast and inner angle limit ( @xmath55 10 ) of the acs coronagraph .",
    "the non - detections provide new constraints on the disk properties as these observations represent the highest contrast observations to date of those targets .",
    "all of the candidates were observed using sequences similar to those used for hd 207129 , with small variations in exposure lengths and roll separations ( 20 30 ) as imposed by _",
    "hst _ pointing constraints .",
    "reference stars ( specified in table [ tab : targs ] ) were observed and their images subtracted as described for hd 207129 . each subtracted image contained a faint , symmetric halo around the star caused by psf mismatches that were largely due to color differences but also time - dependent changes in the optical system .",
    "these halos could hide potential , otherwise - detectable face - on disks .",
    "no disks were detected using reference psf subtractions .",
    "the iterative roll subtraction method was also applied to these targets , using @xmath56 rebinned data , and no disks were detected .    to estimate extended - source detection limits in the roll - subtracted images ,",
    "1@xmath181uniform - intensity squares were added to the two unsubtracted images of hd 82943 at various locations with appropriate orientations .",
    "these were then @xmath56 rebinned and processed with the roll subtraction algorithm .",
    "this process was continually repeated with adjustments made to the squares brightnesses until they appeared at their minimum robust visual detection limit .",
    "the local root - mean - squared ( rms ) noise was measured in the same locations as the squares but in a square - free roll - subtraction .",
    "it appeared that the detection limit ( in flux per pixel ) for the squares was approximately equal to @xmath57 the local rms per - pixel noise .    for each roll - subtracted image of each target , the mean azimuthal rms was computed at each radius centered on the star in the subtracted image . in this calculation , care was taken to avoid background objects such as galaxies and field stars .",
    "these rms noise curves vs. radius were then converted to detection limits using the factor of 1.2 and were then converted to @xmath10 magnitude surface brightnesses .",
    "the resulting curves in figure 8 show that read noise and perhaps sky background noise at large angles set the detection limit to about 24 mag arcsec@xmath7 regardless of star brightness .",
    "the detection limit increases closer to the star where subtraction residuals , which scale with star brightness , dominate .    while the detection limits presented here are expressed in absolute units , what really matters",
    "is the limiting brightness relative to the star , given that a debris disk is optically thin and scales in brightness with its star .",
    "a relative detection limit can be converted to a maximum allowed optical depth along the line of sight .",
    "this can then be used to place constraints on some disk properties , but only if a number other properties are known as multiple parameters can affect line - of - sight optical depth : dust density , albedo , disk height , inclination , degree of forward scattering , etc .",
    "the maximum allowed optical depth ( @xmath21 ) times the albedo ( @xmath58 ) at a given radius @xmath59 ( arcseconds ) from the star is @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the detection limit in mag arcsec@xmath7 and @xmath62 is the magnitude of the star .",
    "note that @xmath58 includes any possible brightening of one side of a disk due to asymmetric scattering .",
    "in general , @xmath63 at 3is about 1  2 @xmath64 for these stars .",
    "possible reasons for not detecting a disk around one of these six candidates include a low grain albedo ( which would render the disk faint ) , a small disk angular radius ( which could leave the system hidden behind the occulting spot ) , or a face - on orientation ( which would make the disk more difficult to distinguish from psf residuals ) .    among the targets surveyed , hd 38206",
    "s low @xmath65 ( royer et al .",
    "2002 ) may indicate that the disk is projected nearly face - on ( assuming the disk is coplanar with the star s equator ) and thus has a low line - of - sight optical depth .",
    "hd 82943 , the nearest of the six disk non - detections , has two radial velocity planets near 1 au ( mayor et al . 2004 ) .",
    "ground - based adaptive optics imaging also failed to detect this disk in scattered light ( schtz et al .",
    "2004 ) ; due the highly stable psf of @xmath4 , our limiting surface brightness ( fig .",
    "[ fig : uplims ] ) is 5 mag better .",
    "this system is comparable to hd 207129 in terms of its stellar type , v magnitude , fractional disk luminosity , and infrared excess sed .",
    "a ring comparable to that of hd 207129 would have an apparent radius of 6 in the hd 82943 system .",
    "scattered light residuals at this radius are only a bit worse than at 10where the hd 207129 ring was detected , so the non - detection of hd 82943 s disk in scattered light indicates different grain properties , a more face - on orientation , or a greater radial width of the emitting region .",
    "the disk of the most distant candidate , hd 113556 , would go undetected if its outer radius was less than 150 au .",
    "based on the observed excess ratio between 24 and 70 @xmath2 m , all eight disks we studied have a characteristic blackbody temperature between 60 and 80 k.    the most prominent difference between the detected and undetected disks is their proximity : @xmath6620 pc for the two detected systems .",
    "this suggests that a disk s angular extent may be the most important property for detectability with @xmath4 , both to avoid blockage by the occulting spot and the higher psf subtraction residuals found closer to the star .",
