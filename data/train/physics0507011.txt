    "the operational principle of simple microcalorimeters and bolometers is based on three components .",
    "an absorber where the incoming power or energy is dissipated and converted into a change in temperature , a sensor that reads the change in temperature , and a thermal link from the detector to the heat sink that brings the system back to equilibrium after a measurement .",
    "the sensor is usually a resistor whose resistance depends strongly on temperature around the working point . in this case a change in resistance can be measured as a change in voltage or a change in current using a current or voltage bias .    in 1982",
    "j.c mather @xcite presented a complete non - equilibrium theory for the noise in simple bolometers with ideal resistive thermometers and in 1984 it was extended to microcalorimeter performance @xcite . at temperatures below  200",
    "mk the ideal assumptions are no longer valid and complex thermal architectures are needed to understand the behavior of these devices . at these low temperatures the thermal fluctuations between the thermometer lattice and its electron system , or between the thermometer and the absorber are no longer negligible and therefore these components must be considered as separate entities in the model .",
    "these non - ideal effects are called electron decoupling and absorber decoupling .",
    "another consequence of working at low temperatures is the increased dependence of the thermometer resistance on the readout power , making the ideal resistance - temperature relationship inaccurate .",
    "galeazzi and mccammon @xcite constructed a general procedure for developing bolometer and microcalorimeter models for these complex thermal architectures using block diagram formalism of control theory .    to quantify the relation between incoming power or energy and the measured change in voltage or current , including non - ideal effects , this paper follows the modeling procedure of galeazzi and mccammon @xcite . the first step in this modeling procedure is to set up the temperature equations , then apply a taylor expansion to derive a linear model for small temperature deviations from equilibrium .",
    "afterward , fourier transforms are used to express the equations in the frequency domain , and finally the coupled equations are solved using block diagram algebra .",
    "this procedure yields closed form solutions for the responsivity and dynamic impedance of the model , including noise contributions .",
    "the two models developed in this paper are modifications of the absorber decoupling model obtained in @xcite .",
    "model 1 was developed to describe the new generation of transition edge sensor detectors where the absorber is not electrically isolated from the thermometer by a gluing agent but rather the two are deposited one on top of the other @xcite .",
    "model 2 describes microcalorimeters that have the heat sink connected to the absorber instead of to the thermometer .",
    "this may occur when the absorber is much bigger than the thermometer and therefore it is necessary to connect the heat sink to the absorber rather than to the thermometer .",
    "these two models will help optimize the next generation of detectors , and because of the analytical results of the modeling procedure the relations between the detector s resolution and the different parameters included in the model should be clear .",
    "this model is suitable to describe tes detectors with an integrated absorber . in this model",
    "both the electron system and the absorber are detached from the lattice .",
    "the lattice is connected to the heat sink by a thermal conductivity @xmath0 , the electron system is connected to the lattice by a thermal conductivity @xmath1 , and the absorber is connected to the electron system by a thermal conductivity @xmath2 ( see fig .  [ ta1 ] ) .",
    "the absorber is directly connected to the electron system instead of the lattice because with integrated absorbers the absorber - lattice thermal coupling is expected to be negligible compared to that of the absorber - electron system .",
    "the following equations determine the temperature for each of the three components in the model : @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are the heat capacities of the absorber , the electron system , and the lattice system respectively , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the corresponding temperatures .",
    "@xmath13 is the incoming outside power to be measured and @xmath14 is the joule power dissipated into the sensor by the bias current / voltage . in the case of microcalorimeters",
    "@xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the photon energy and @xmath17 is the delta function .",
    "the equilibrium conditions of the system are obtained by setting the outside power to zero ( @xmath18 ) , and @xmath19 ( @xmath20= @xmath21 , @xmath22 , or @xmath23 ) since the equilibrium temperatures are independent of time",
    ". therefore the equilibrium temperatures @xmath24 of the absorber , @xmath25 of the electron system , and @xmath26 of the lattice are given by the integrals in the previous three equations .",
    "for example the integral in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] must equal zero at equilibrium , which implies that the thermal equilibrium temperature of the absorber is the same as that of the electron system .",
    "we are interested in small deviations about the equilibrium temperatures , therefore we set @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the equilibrium temperature for each component of the model , and @xmath29 is the small temperature deviation from equilibrium : @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32    in the small signal limit @xmath29 is small compared to @xmath28 , and a taylor expansion up to the first @xmath29 term is appropriate .",
    "the results are the equations that determine small temperature deviations about equilibrium : @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 , and for simplicity we used @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "these are coupled differential equations which are difficult to solve directly ; instead they are transformed into coupled algebraic equations using fourier transforms .",
    "the quantity @xmath39 represents what is known as the electro - thermal feedback term and can be written as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 ; ( see reference @xcite ) . converting eqs .",

    "let @xmath55 be either @xmath53 or @xmath54 , and introduce the quantity @xmath56 to be deduced from the previous two equations . then eqs .",
    "[ c1 ] and [ c2 ] can be summarized as : @xmath57 equations [ fd1 ] , [ fd2 ] , [ fd3 ] , and [ c3 ] can be solved using the block diagram of fig .

    "the dynamic impedance differs from the detector resistance due to the effect of the electro - thermal feedback . when the current changes , the power dissipated into the detector changes too , therefore the temperature and the detector s resistance change .",
    "the dynamic impedance is a useful parameter because it is easily measured experimentally . to find the dynamic impedance we use @xmath62 in eqs .",

    "it corresponds to the power that would be required as input to the detector in order to generate an output equal to the signal generated by the noise .",

    "figure  [ bd2 ] shows where each noise term should be added to the block diagram ( for more details see  @xcite ) . solving the noise block diagram for each noise term independently and dividing by the responsivity obtained in eq .",
