    "proposing a consistent microscopic explanation of the celebrated thermodynamical properties of black holes found by bekenstein @xcite and hawking @xcite in the 70 s is certainly one of the most important theoretical tests for any candidates to quantum gravity .",
    "it is indeed expected from any theories of quantum gravity to provide a framework for understanding the statistical physics behind these thermodynamical properties and , more particularly , for finding the fundamental excitations responsible for the black hole entropy .",
    "almost four decades after the discovery by bekenstein and hawking , in different approaches of quantum gravity , we have witnessed a lot of progresses in the field of black hole thermodynamics . there",
    "exist dozens of different technical derivations of the black hole entropy from semi - classical arguments or from theories of quantum gravity .",
    "however , it is fair to observe that the question of the microscopic structure of black holes is not totally resolved .",
    "we still do not precisely know what does the huge black hole entropy really count : the counting is clear but the content is not . even in the much simpler case of three dimensional gravity , the nature of the fundamental excitations of the celebrated btz black hole @xcite responsible for its entropy remains unknown ( see @xcite for a review ) . from the point of view of loop quantum gravity , the derivation of black hole entropy relies mainly on the idea that this entropy counts essentially the number of ways the macroscopic horizon area can be obtained as a sum of fundamental excitations .",
    "the area law has been recovered originally for non - rotating macroscopic black holes in @xcite and then the counting was upgraded in different ways @xcite .",
    "in fact , the derivation of the black hole entropy in loop quantum gravity relies essentially on two ingredients .",
    "first , the black hole is defined by its horizon which is assumed to be a boundary in space - time .",
    "second , the classical geometrical properties of the horizon ( null - surface , no expansion etc ... ) are turned into quantum constraints which make the quantum black hole degrees of freedom to be described by a chern - simons theory .",
    "more precisely , the symplectic structure of the black hole degrees of freedom are given by the chern - simons poisson bracket on a punctured two - sphere @xmath4 with gauge group @xmath5 and the level @xmath6 is proportional to the horizon area @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the compact group @xmath8 is reminiscent of the internal gauge group of gravity expressed in terms of the ashtekar - barbero connection . regarding the punctures",
    ", there is a priori an arbitrary number of them , denoted @xmath9 in the sequel .",
    "they are the fundamental excitations , associated to a spin - network in the space manifold and colored with @xmath8 unitary irreducible representations @xmath10 , which cross the horizon .",
    "the macroscopic horizon area @xmath11 results from the sum of the fundamental excitations @xmath12 carried by the punctures . here",
    "@xmath0 denotes the barbero - immirzi parameter which enters in the spectrum of the area operator in loop quantum gravity and @xmath13 is the planck length @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this picture , the black holes micro - states are elements of the physical hilbert space of the @xmath8 chern - simons theory on a punctured two - sphere , and the entropy of a black hole whose horizon has an area @xmath7 counts the number of such micro - states provided that the condition ( [ area spectrum ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "then , one needs to understand the hamiltonian quantization of chern - simons theory .",
    "for this reason , the three dimensional space - time required for the chern - simons theory is assumed to be locally of the form @xmath14 $ ] where @xmath15 is a riemann surface . when the gauge group @xmath16 is compact , the ( canonical and covariant ) quantization is very well understood .",
    "it has been studied intensively since the discoveries by witten that first three dimensional gravity can be reformulated in terms of a chern - simons theory @xcite , and then that the quantum amplitudes of the chern - simons theory are closely related to topological three - manifolds invariants and knots invariants @xcite .",
    "the so - called combinatorial quantization is certainly one of the most powerful hamiltonian quantization scheme of the chern - simons theory because it can be applied not only to a large class of compact @xcite and non - compact gauge groups @xcite but also to any punctured riemann surfaces @xmath15 ( note that loop quantum gravity techniques are very successful when there is no cosmological constant @xcite , and the case of non - vanishing cosmological is still under construction @xcite ) .",
    "when the gauge group is @xmath5 and the surface @xmath15 is a punctured two - sphere , the physical hilbert space @xmath17 , where @xmath10 color the punctures , has a very simple structure .",
    "it can be constructed from the representation theory of the quantum group @xmath18 where the quantum deformation parameter @xmath19 is related to the level @xmath6 of the chern - simons theory by @xmath20 . because the gauge group is compact ,",
    "@xmath6 is necessarily integer and then @xmath19 is a root of unity .",
    "this result has important consequences : it makes the number of unitary irreducible representations ( irreps ) of @xmath18 finite and is somehow responsible for the good convergence properties of the chern - simons quantum amplitudes . as for the classical lie group @xmath8",
    ", the irreps are labeled by spins @xmath21 ( which are half - integers ) , they are realized on a finite dimensional vector space @xmath22 of dimension @xmath23 , but contrary to the classical case , @xmath21 is bounded from above according to the inequality @xmath24 .",
    "finally , the physical hilbert space @xmath25 is the space of @xmath18 invariant vectors ( equivalently intertwiners ) in the tensor product of the representations vector spaces @xmath22 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is inherited from the ( right or left invariant ) haar measure on the quantum group @xmath28 ( the standard notation for the space of polynomial functions or its cauchy completion ) . in that respect ,",
    "the black hole microstates from the point of view of loop quantum gravity are intertwiners between the representations coloring the links crossing the horizon .",
    "these representations are viewed as @xmath18 representations .",
    "obviously , @xmath25 has a finite dimension given by @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "this formula ( or its classical limit when @xmath31 ) is known as the verlinde formula and is in the core of the calculation of the black hole entropy in loop quantum gravity .",
    "the counting of microstates leads to the bekenstein - hawking area law provided that the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath0 is fixed to a particular finite and real value .",
    "recovering the area law is clearly a non - trivial success of loop quantum gravity but the important role played by @xmath0 in this result , whereas it is totally irrelevant in the classical theory , has raised important questions on the validity of this counting .",
    "these last couple of years may have brought new interesting insights to resolve this puzzle .",
    "these new ideas mainly relies on an interpretation of @xmath0 as a regulator in the theory and not as a fundamental constant .",
    "indeed , the ashtekar - barbero connection together with the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath0 has been introduced @xcite in loop quantum gravity to circumvent the problem of the reality conditions .",
    "therefore , considering a real parameter @xmath0 appears as a technical trick ( a kind of wick rotation ) to avoid having to work with the original complex ashtekar variables and to start the quantization , at least at the kinematical level .",
    "so far , no one knows how to start the quantization of gravity in the complex ashtekar formulation , which corresponds to taking @xmath2 . in that sense ,",
    "the introduction of a real @xmath0 in the theory is a necessity in loop quantum gravity , exactly as it is necessary to consider a wick rotation in quantum field theory to compute path integrals for instance .",
    "however , we should return to the complex value @xmath2 at some point .",
    "furthermore , this requirement is strongly suggested by the classical theory .",
    "indeed , it has been known for a long time that the ashtekar - barbero connection is not a full space - time connection whereas the original complex connection is certainly one @xcite .",
    "this observation has led to the idea that , even though the ashtekar - barbero connection is suitable for the kinematical quantization of loop quantum gravity , it could not be the proper variable to deal with the dynamics and the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "this fact was concretely realized in three space - time dimensions where , after introducing a barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath0 in the model @xcite , it has been shown that the ashtekar - barbero connection could not lead to a resolution of the hamiltonian constraint , and it is necessary to work in the self - dual variables to solve the dynamics @xcite .",
    "moreover , we showed that if the spectrum of the geometric operators is discrete and @xmath0-dependent at the kinematical level , it becomes continuous and @xmath0-independent at the physical level .",
    "formally , it is possible to recover the physical spectrum from the kinematical one sending @xmath0 to the values @xmath32 and , at the same time , sending the representations ( which label the edges of the spin - networks ) @xmath33 to the complex values @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a real number .",
    "considering @xmath36 instead of @xmath33 half - integer is easily interpreted as coloring the spin - networks in terms of @xmath37 irreps ( in the continuous series ) instead of @xmath8 irreps .",
    "it is interesting to notice that a simple analytic continuation of the physical parameter reproduce the exact physical expressions for the eigenvalues of geometric operators .",
    "all these strongly suggests that one should interpret @xmath0 as a regulator which should be sent to the complex value @xmath2 .",
    "another strong indication comes from the physics of black holes in loop quantum gravity .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , that for a fixed number of punctures and in the limit of large spins , the analytically - continued dimension of the @xmath38 chern - simons hilbert space ( which can be understood as the weight assigned to a black hole microscopic configuration ) behaves exactly as @xmath39 .",
    "the analytic continuation consists in first replacing the discrete dimensions @xmath40 in the formula ( [ dimcs ] ) by the complex numbers @xmath34 and then in fixing @xmath0 to the value @xmath32 in order for the area spectrum ( [ area spectrum ] ) to remain positive and real .",
    "interestingly , it was observed that the same analytically - continued technique can be naturally applied to compute the three - dimensional btz black hole entropy @xcite . in this case",
    "however , it is the sign of the cosmological constant and not @xmath0 that plays the role of a regulator .",
    "the proposal of @xcite is supported by remarkable additional facts @xcite .",
    "finally , all these observations strongly suggest that we should take seriously the idea to return in some way to the original self - dual variables in loop quantum gravity .",
    "either we extend the analytic continuation method to the full kinematical hilbert space and eventually to the spin - foam amplitudes , or we use this analytic continuation process to guide us towards a resolution of the reality conditions . in both cases , it is first of all necessary to understand in a more ( mathematically ) rigorous way the analytic continuation proposed in @xcite which is precisely the aim of this article .      what has been proposed in @xcite",
    "is an analytic continuation of the dimension ( [ dimcs ] ) viewed as a function on a discrete set is not clear in this process @xcite .",
    "it seems that @xmath6 remains real .",
    "nonetheless , it is possible to assume that @xmath6 is sent to a purely imaginary variable , exactly as the summation variable @xmath41 , which makes the sum ( [ dimcs ] ) unchanged ( at the classical limit when @xmath6 is large ) .",
    "the role of @xmath6 will be totally clarified in the present article . ]",
    "where the discrete variables @xmath42 becomes complex ( more precisely , purely imaginary ) .",
    "schematically , the analytic continuation is defined by the map @xmath43 .",
    "it goes without saying that such a process is highly non - trivial and in general not unique .",
    "however , complex analysis provides us with powerful tools to define rigorously this kind of transformations .",
    "these tools ( essentially morse theory ) have been extensively used by witten @xcite to study the analytic continuation of chern - simons theory from integer values of @xmath6 to complex values . as we want to perform an analytic continuation of the dimension of the chern - simons hilbert space , the methods developed in @xcite",
    "seem totally appropriate for our purposes .",
    "we show this is indeed the case . not only we obtain a mathematically well - defined analytic continuation of ( [ dimcs ] ) ( with ambiguities related to choices of the contour in the complex plane ) but we also compute its ( semi - classical ) asymptotic behavior .",
    "interestingly , we obtain the result of @xcite with some corrections .    to obtain these results ,",
    "we proceed in different steps .",
    "first we write ( [ dimcs ] ) as an integral in the complex plane because we interpret the sum over @xmath41 in ( [ dimcs ] ) as a sum of residues .",
    "hence , ( [ dimcs ] ) can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a closed contour in the complex plane , @xmath46 a measure independent of the colors and @xmath47 a holomorphic function which depends on the colors .",
    "then , we perform an analytic continuation to a purely imaginary level @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) keeping the contour @xmath45 fixed .",
    "we see immediately that such a continuation leads to a vanishing integral and then to a non - consistent analytic continuation of the number of microstates . however , when the dimensions @xmath40 become are non longer integer ( they are purely imaginary dimension @xmath50 , @xmath51 , in our case ) , then the analytic continuation is non - trivial and leads to a very interesting analytic continuation of ( [ dimcs ] ) .",
    "in fact , this continuation is uniquely defined up to a discrete ambiguity which is very similar to the one raised by witten @xcite ( and mainly based on @xcite ) when he recalls the construction of the analytic continuation of the bessel function .",
    "more precisely , the contour is defined up to a translation @xmath52 , @xmath53 , in the complex plane .",
    "fortunately , there exists one natural choice of the contour which leads to the expected semi - classical behavior of the analytic continued number of microstates .",
    "computing such an asymptotic is technically rather involved . to simplify the problem",
    ", we first assume that the horizon is punctured by @xmath9 edges all colored with the same complex spin @xmath54 : this defines what is called the one color black hole model in the article . in that case",
    ", the expression of the function @xmath47 introduced above simplifies and the complex integral can be reformulated as an integral@xmath55 where @xmath9 plays the role of the inverse planck constant and the action @xmath56 is a holomorphic function ( which depends on @xmath57 ) in the complex plane ( @xmath58 ) . as shown in @xcite , @xmath9 becomes large at the semi - classical limit . as a consequence ,",
    "the semi - classical behavior is determined from the saddle point approximation , hence from the analysis of the critical points of the action @xmath56 .",
    "we show that there is one critical point which dominates the classical limit . following the saddle point approximation techniques at the vicinity of this critical point",
    ", we obtain the large @xmath9 behavior of the number of microstates .",
    "this enables us to obtain the microcanonical entropy for the one color black hole model which reproduces the area law supplemented with quantum corrections .",
    "we go further and compute the canonical and grand canonical entropy .",
    "interestingly , with a simple choice of the chemical potential , the quantum corrections are logarithmic , of the form @xmath59 , i.e. the same as the one obtained for black holes with a real @xmath0 .",
    "we reproduce the analysis in the case where the punctures are colored by an arbitrary but finite number @xmath60 of different colors @xmath61 assuming that each number @xmath62 of punctures colored by @xmath63 becomes large in the same way at the semi - classical limit .",
    "we show that the black hole entropy still satisfies the area law in this general case with quantum corrections ( which are logarithmic with a particular choice of chemical potential ) .",
    "our calculation is rigorous and gives a mathematical justification of @xcite . in that respect ,",
    "it is particularly interesting to note that the  naive \" analytic continuation presented in @xcite reproduces , at the semi - classical limit , the good leading - order term .",
    "furthermore , the method we are developing in this article can be applied to generic situations and we hope to extend it to construct spin - foam models or kinematical scalar products for complex ashtekar gravity .      the article is organized as follows . after this introduction ,",
    "we propose in section ii an overlook of the recent results obtained in the context of complex black holes .",
    "first , we recall the main results of the  naive \" analytic continuation in @xcite and show how the area law is immediately recovered at the semi - classical limit . then , we recall and adapt the analysis of the black hole ( canonical and grand canonical ) partition function done in @xcite when the area spectrum is continuous .",
    "this analysis is particularly important for our purposes because the study of the thermodynamical limit enables us to define the semi - classical limit as the regime where the horizon area @xmath7 is large together with the number of punctures @xmath9 and their colors @xmath35 .",
    "section iii is devoted to studying the analytic continuation of ( [ dimcs ] ) from rigorous complex analysis .",
    "we start by studying the effect of turning the ( discrete ) level @xmath6 into a pure imaginary number @xmath64 .",
    "this is done by expressing the chern - simons dimension as an integral @xmath65 in the complex plane .",
    "we show that , if @xmath6 becomes purely imaginary , the representations @xmath40 must no longer be discrete for the analytic continuation to be non - vanishing , hence we replace the integers @xmath40 by purely imaginary numbers , i.e. @xmath66 . then , we analyze the asymptotic of the analytic continued version of the number of microstates .",
    "to do so , we first study the case where the @xmath9 punctures are colored with the same @xmath67 : this defines the one color black hole model . in that case",
    ", the integral @xmath65 can be written as @xmath68 where @xmath45 is the integration contour , @xmath69 is a well - defined measure and the action @xmath56 is a holomorphic function which depends on the color @xmath57 .",
    "the saddle point approximation immediately leads us to the large @xmath9 asymptotic of @xmath65 and reproduces the area law for the microcanonical entropy .",
    "we perform the grand canonical analysis of the model and show that , with a simple choice of chemical potential , the quantum correction of the entropy are logarithmic .",
    "we generalize the study to a system of @xmath9 punctures colored by a finite number @xmath60 of colors @xmath70 .",
    "we conclude in section iv with a brief summary and a discussion .",
    "we argue on the possibility to adapt these techniques to construct spin - foam amplitudes or kinematical scalar products in the self - dual sector of loop quantum gravity .",
    "the derivation of black hole entropy relies essentially on the idea that the macroscopic horizon area is realized as the sum of microscopic contributions ( quanta of area ) excited by the spin network edges which puncture the horizon . in this picture",
    ", the counting of the microstates leads to the bekenstein - hawking area law provided that @xmath0 is fixed to a particular finite and real value .",
    "the fact that this parameter seems to play such a crucial role in the quantum theory even though it is totally irrelevant at the classical level has raised some doubts .",
    "new insights have been developed the last years to resolve this contradiction .",
    "the first one is that the quantum degrees of freedom of a spherical black hole in loop quantum gravity are those of an @xmath8 chern - simons theory where the level @xmath6 is proportional to the horizon area @xmath7 according to the relation @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "the second one is to consider a black hole with a complex barbero - immirzi parameter .",
    "this makes totally sense because considering @xmath0 complex is directly related to considering the analytic continuation of chern - simons theory to complex values of the level k @xcite .",
    "this last idea was realized concretely in @xcite and led in a very direct way to the area law for the black hole entropy when @xmath0 takes the special values @xmath32 .",
    "this strongly indicates that @xmath0 is a regulator which should be fixed to @xmath32 at some point .",
    "it corresponds to returning to the original complex ashtekar variables .",
    "this section aims at recalling first the analytic continuation performed in @xcite .",
    "then , we will recall and adapt ( to continuous spins ) the thermodynamical properties of the complex black holes studied recently in @xcite .",
    "this enables to characterize the semi - classical regime and , in particular , to show that the number of punctures becomes large at the semi - classical limit ( or equivalently the thermodynamical limit ) when @xmath7 is large .",
    "the computation of the black hole entropy in loop quantum gravity is roughly based on two formulae .",
    "the first one is the expression of the horizon area @xmath7 recalled in the introduction ( [ area spectrum ] ) .",
    "the second one is the expression ( [ dimcs ] ) of the number of microstates with the level @xmath6 fixed by the relation @xmath72 as shown in @xcite .    for a configuration where @xmath73 for every @xmath74 , it is easy to show that ( [ dimcs ] ) reproduces the area law at the semi - classical limit ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) @xmath77 provided that @xmath0 is fixed according to @xmath78 .",
    "a similar result holds when we take into account all the possible configurations with a different real value for the barbero - immirzi parameter . in the latter case ,",
    "one recovers the area law only if one assumes the distinguishability of the punctures . in @xcite",
    ", we asked the question whether it could make sense to extend the framework of black hole thermodynamics in loop quantum gravity to complex values of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , we are interested only in the case @xmath79 . for the answer to be positive",
    ", it is necessary to keep the area @xmath7 ( [ area spectrum ] ) real while @xmath0 becomes complex .",
    "this condition is satisfied only if @xmath36 or equivalently if the dimension @xmath80 becomes purely imaginary . in that case",
    ", @xmath7 is necessarily real and we can easily make it positive by choosing the suitable square root @xmath81 in the area spectrum ( [ area spectrum ] ) .",
    "concerning the number of states , its analytic continuation is much less obvious to define .",
    "the reason is that the level @xmath6 which appear in the upper bound of the sum ( [ dimcs ] ) becomes purely imaginary @xmath82 .",
    "we can suppose @xmath83 without loss of generality .",
    "therefore , the sum becomes a priori meaningless . to make it well - defined",
    ", a  naive \" idea is to assume that the label @xmath41 becomes also purely imaginary , which would correspond to a discrete analog of turning the integration path ( in the integral of a complex - valued function ) in the complex plane from the real line @xmath84 to the purely imaginary line @xmath85 . with this  naive \" definition of the analytic continuation ,",
    "it is immediate to show that the number of microstates behaves as @xmath86 at the semi - classical limit ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) and then reproduces the area law up to a small and real regulator @xmath89 . in the right hand side of ( [ asymp naive ] )",
    ", @xmath90 refers to a function of @xmath7 in planck units .",
    "the more striking observation is that we recover immediately the area law with the natural choice @xmath79 .",
    "this situation strongly contrasts with what happens in the real @xmath0 case .",
    "nonetheless , this observation raises several questions and remarks .    1 .   the method proposed to perform the analytic continuation needs a finite regulator @xmath89 to be well defined , otherwise it diverges .",
    "what it the deep meaning of this regulator ? how is it fixed to a non - zero value ? 2 .",
    "one analytic continuation was proposed .",
    "is it uniquely defined ? 3 .",
    "for the last remark , let us assume that the representations @xmath33 are all equal and fixed to the value @xmath21 . in that case , we notice immediately that , at the classical limit , the number of microstates is polynomial in @xmath21 when the representations are discrete whereas it increases exponentially in @xmath21 when it is complex , @xmath91 where @xmath57 is continuous .",
    "this remark generalizes immediately to the case where the representations @xmath33 are different .",
    "a similar phenomenon exists in chern - simons theory where the quantum amplitudes ( which are given by the colored jones polynomial up to eventual normalizations ) behave in total different ways at the semi - classical limit when @xmath6 is discrete or not .",
    "this observation is crucial for the celebrated volume conjecture @xcite .",
    "the last remarks suggests that our question present strong similarities with some important questions related to the quantum amplitudes of chern - simons theories .",
    "therefore , we should look at the analytic continuation of chern - simons theory which is essential to understand the volume conjecture according to witten @xcite .",
    "this strategy has been successfully applied for our purpose . as we are going to show in section [ complex analysis ] , we have adapted the complex analysis techniques presented in great detail in @xcite to define properly the analytic continuation of ( [ dimcs ] ) .",
    "interestingly , we have recovered in that way exactly the leading order term ( [ asymp naive ] ) obtained in the naive analytic continuation , but the quantum corrections are different .",
    "furthermore , these methods have enabled us to answer the two first questions above .",
    "the regulator @xmath89 can be shown to be a function of the area @xmath7 at the semi - classical limit .",
    "the question of the unicity of the analytic continuation is transposed into a question of finding suitable integration contours in the complex plane .",
    "we have shown that there is indeed an ambiguity in the choice of the integration contour , the same one as the ambiguity illustrated by witten in @xcite to define the analytic continuation of the bessel function ( as originally shown in @xcite ) .",
    "but the  simplest \" choice ( and somehow the most natural one ) leads to the expected behavior for the number of microstates . before explaining these results in detail in section [ complex analysis ]",
    ", we will continue presenting the complex black hole focussing now on its thermodynamical physical properties .",
    "understanding these properties is essential in the construction and in the asymptotic analysis of the analytic continuation of the number of microstates .",
    "in statistical physic , the number of microstates ( [ dimcs ] ) and its analytic continuation is the building block for computing the microcanonical partition function of the black hole .",
    "there is no need of notion of energy nor of temperature to define this partition function because we are counting the number of microstates of a totally isolated system . as a consequence ,",
    "the microcanonical ensemble is not the good framework to study thermodynamical properties of the black hole and to understand , for instance , how the semi - classical regime is achieved . on the contrary ,",
    "the canonical and grand canonical ensemble do enable us to study the thermodynamical limit provided that we could associate to the quantum black hole a proper notion of energy . defining a good notion of black hole energy",
    "is a difficult problem in quantum gravity mainly because of the famous problem of time .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that there is a well - defined notion of energy if one introduces a new length scale @xmath92 into the scenario .",
    "this scale measures the proper distance of a stationary observer from the black hole horizon , and @xmath93 is the acceleration needed to keep its distance to the horizon fixed .",
    "it is remarkable to notice that such an observer associates an energy to the black hole which is proportional to the area horizon @xmath7 according to the formula @xmath94 we have denoted by @xmath95 the number of punctures crossing the horizon colored by @xmath33 .",
    "this expression is different from the energy ( the mass ) of the black hole far away from the horizon which is proportional to the square root of @xmath7 .",
    "note that this formula holds for @xmath33 integers or @xmath33 complex with respectively @xmath0 real and @xmath2 .",
    "now , we have the main ingredient to compute the canonical partition function @xmath96 defined for a fixed number @xmath9 of punctures as a function of the inverse temperature @xmath97 . the equivalence between the microcanonical and the canonical ensembles implies that , @xmath98 where the sum over @xmath99 is such that @xmath100 .",
    "here , the partition function is obtained as a sum over families @xmath101 which define microstates @xmath102 such that the color @xmath33 appears @xmath95 times .",
    "the degeneracy factor @xmath103 , it is given by the dimension of the chern - simons hilbert space ( [ dimcs ] ) or by its analytic continuation for the microscopic black hole configuration @xmath104 .",
    "the presence of the factorials enables us to implement indistinguishability between the @xmath95 punctures with the same color @xmath33 .",
    "the appropriate way to implement the indistinguishability would have been to make a choice of quantum statistics ( bosons , fermions or eventually anyons ) for these punctures which was done in @xcite . for simplicity here , we implement the indistinguishability by introducing a gibbs factor in the partition function ( the factorials ) which is well - known to be a good approximation of the quantum statistics at the ( high temperature ) thermodynamic limit . the computation of ( [ canonical ] ) does not give a simple closed formula when we take the exact chern - simons dimension for the degeneracy factors @xmath103 .",
    "fortunately , it is good enough to consider the expression of @xmath103 for large @xmath33 ( or equivalently large @xmath35 in the complex case ) which enables us to understand properly the thermodynamical limit . with this approximation ,",
    "the area spectrum becomes linear and the degeneracy factor is either polynomial ( [ discrete asymp ] ) in the variables @xmath33 when they are discrete whereas it is exponential ( [ asymp naive ] ) in the variables @xmath35 when @xmath105 is complex : @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are normalization coefficients .",
    "we will not take them into account in this section , and for simplicity , we fix them to @xmath109 ( even if @xmath108 depends on the regulator @xmath89 ) .",
    "indeed , the normalization factors are not relevant for our purposes here , but we will not neglect them in the following section . we will show that there are responsible for the quantum corrections to the entropy .",
    "it is straightforward to make sense of the partition function @xmath110 when @xmath33 are discrete .",
    "a simple calculation leads to the following exact formula ( when the area spectrum is linear ) @xmath111 the canonical partition function is a smooth function of the temperature and then admits no singularities ( a part from its divergence at very high temperature @xmath112 ) .",

    "the case with an arbitrary number of punctures will not be studied in this article , but it will presumably lead to the same qualitative ( and even quantitative ) results as the ones we are going to establish . for clarity reasons ,",
    "we start with a configuration where the @xmath9 punctures have the same color @xmath57 . in that case",

    "let us make some important remarks concerning this result .    1",
    ".   the presence of the phase @xmath223 in the asymptotic expansion raises questions .",
    "indeed , we expect the analytic continuation to be a non - negative real function for it to define a number of black hole microstates .",
    "we propose two options to resolve this puzzle .",
    "first , it might be that only the modulus @xmath224 could be interpreted as the number of microstates and then there is no more problem with the phase .",
    "another possibility is that the number of punctures @xmath9 is not totally arbitrary and one must choose it such that the phase is fixed to one , which implies that @xmath225 where @xmath226 is a natural number .",
    "the interpretation of such a condition is not clear but one of its interesting consequence is that the minimal number of punctures is @xmath227 . for the time being , we will chose the first option and then we will simply omit the phase in the asymptotic .",
    "2 .   up to a global multiplicative factor ,",
    "the asymptotic obtained rigorously here has an expression very similar to the one obtained  intuitively \" or  naively \" in @xcite and briefly recalled in the introduction ( [ asymp naive ] ) .",
    "in particular , we can clearly identify the regular @xmath89 introduced in @xcite to avoid having divergences in the analytic continuation with the term @xmath228 which appears at the power @xmath9 in the formula above .",
    "thus , the regulator is not arbitrary and its relevance receives here a clear justification .",
    "this gives an answer to the first question raised in subsection ( [ gamma = i ] ) .",
    "so far we have a clear interpretation of the leading order term @xmath229 in the large @xmath7 expansion of the entropy @xmath230 but the status of the subleading terms is still enigmatic at this point . if we remind the analysis of @xcite recalled in subsection ( [ subsection partition ] ) , both the average number of punctures and the average color grow like @xmath231 . thus",
    ", it is expected that , at the semi - classical limit , we can replace @xmath9 by @xmath232 and the color @xmath57 by @xmath233 where @xmath234 and @xmath235 are numerical constant .",
    "if this is the case , the analytic continuation of entropy behaves at the classical limit as @xmath236 where the phase in ( [ asymp gauss ] ) has been disregarded . due to the presence of the second term in the previous expansion ,",
    "quantum corrections seem a priori larger than the ones found in @xcite .",
    "the reason of these discrepancies is simple and relies on the fact that we have not implemented the indistinguishability so far .",
    "an immediate way to implement the indistinguishability consists in adding a gibbs factor in the definition of the number of microstates .",
    "concretely , we replace @xmath217 by @xmath237 .",
    "finally , the stirling formula leads to the following expansion of the microcanonical entropy @xmath238 which agrees with @xcite as expected .",
    "we also obtain logarithmic corrections .",
    "nonetheless , at this point we can not trust completely the quantum corrections and particularly the numerical coefficients in each subleading terms in the large @xmath7 expansion of the entropy .",
    "indeed , we have assumed here that @xmath9 and @xmath57 are exactly proportional to @xmath231 with no subleading corrections .",
    "but , as we are going to see , subleading corrections do exist and slightly modify the quantum corrections of the entropy .",
    "up to now , the analysis is microcanonical and the asymptotic behavior of @xmath9 and @xmath57 is essentially based on an analogy with @xcite . hence , the parameter @xmath234 and @xmath235 are unfixed , and , as we have just said , the precise form of @xmath9 and @xmath57 in terms of @xmath7 is unknown . to get a more accurate expression of @xmath9 and @xmath57 and explicit values of these two parameters @xmath234 and @xmath235",
    ", it is necessary to perform a grand canonical analysis of the complex black hole .",
    "this is indeed the good framework to compute the mean values of the number of punctures , the mean color and the quantum corrections to the entropy .      here , we consider the black hole as a gas of indistinguishable punctures . as proposed in @xcite , we first assume that the chemical potential of these punctures vanishes . as we are going to see later , considering",
    "a non - vanishing chemical potential will appear very interesting concerning the quantum corrections of the entropy .",
    "for the time being , the grand canonical partition function depends only on the ( inverse ) temperature @xmath97 and is defined by @xmath239 where the energy ( [ fgp energy ] ) is @xmath240 and the degeneracy factor @xmath241 should be given by the integral @xmath217 ( [ one color ] ) .",
    "in the series @xmath9 runs over non - zero integers and the integral over @xmath57 is the lebesgue measure on @xmath242 where @xmath123 is an eventual non - zero area gap . there is no explicit and simple expression for @xmath243 when @xmath241 is exactly given by ( [ one color ] ) : the sum over @xmath9 can be performed but the integral over @xmath57 is difficult to handle . for simplicity , we will approximate @xmath241 by the large @xmath9 asymptotic of @xmath217 , up to the phase factor and the irrelevant @xmath244 multiplicative factor which will be omitted .",

    "it is easy to see that the grand canonical partition function is defined only for @xmath249 . indeed , when @xmath250 is non positive , the integral over @xmath57 diverges .",

    "the subleasing corrections to the area law starts with a term proportional to @xmath231 .",
    "in addition , we have here logarithmic corrections .",
    "note the discrepancies between this expression for the entropy and the one we would have obtained from ( [ micro entropy ] ) replacing @xmath234 and @xmath235 by their expressions found above .",
    "the reason comes from the fact that now we have not neglected to subleading terms in the large @xmath7 expansion of the mean number of punctures @xmath9 and the mean color @xmath57 ( [ affine s and n ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare this expression to the grand canonical entropy .",
    "as we have argued , we start with a vanishing chemical potential for the punctures .",
    "hence , the grand canonical entropy simply depends on the temperature and is defined by @xmath288 there is no simple formula for the grand canonical entropy in general .",
    "however , close to the unruh temperature , we can replace @xmath289 by its semi - classical expression ( [ zsc ] ) and a direct calculation leads to @xmath290 where we used the relations @xmath291 and @xmath292 . of course",
    ", the leading order terms of the two entropies agree ( which is a consequence of the equivalence of the statistical ensembles ) but the subleading terms differ essentially due to the fluctuations of the area in the grand canonical ensemble .      in general , it is expected that quantum corrections to the entropy are logarithmic . here , they are much larger because they start with a @xmath231 term and then comes the logarithmic term .",
    "let us note that @xmath231 is proportional to the mean number of punctures @xmath9 which means that considering a non trivial chemical potential @xmath46 for the gas of punctures might cancel the @xmath231 term of the entropy and leaves us with logarithmic corrections only .",
    "we are going to show that , for a particular choice of @xmath46 , this is indeed the case .",

    "the analysis of its behavior close to the unruh temperature is now immediate and leads to the following asymptotic expansion : @xmath297 as previously , we will replace the exact partition function by its semi - classical approximation .",
    "the mean area @xmath7 and the mean number of punctures @xmath298 at the vicinity of @xmath126 follow immediately @xmath299 notice that we recover what has been computed in previous subsections when @xmath300 .",
    "we have now all the ingredients to compute the large @xmath7 expansion of the grand canonical entropy @xmath301 we start by expressing the entropy in term of the variable @xmath250 . using the approximations @xmath302 where @xmath303",
    ", we obtain @xmath304 where @xmath305 is in fact a constant .",
    "when we replace @xmath250 by its expression in terms of @xmath7 , we get the following large @xmath7 expansion @xmath306 as a consequence , when the chemical potential is fixed at @xmath3 where @xmath1 is the unruh temperature , the grand canonical entropy has only logarithmic corrections @xmath307 when the area is large .",
    "note that the logarithmic corrections comes with the numerical factor @xmath308 which is identical to the one obtained for black hole entropy with a real barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this observation is particularly interesting because logarithmic corrections are supposed to be universal and independent of @xmath0 when it is real .",
    "the universality of the quantum corrections to the entropy seems to hold when @xmath2 .",
    "this universality is nonetheless limited to the one color black hole model .",
    "when many colors are allowed , the rate of logarithmic corrections change and depends , as we will see , in the number of colors .      in this section",
    ", we are going to show that previous results become widespread to black holes with a finite number @xmath60 of colors . among the @xmath9 punctures which cross the horizon ,",
    "@xmath309 are colored with the color @xmath310 , @xmath311 with the color @xmath312 and so on .",
    "therefore , we get the relations : @xmath313      exactly as in the one color black hole model , we assume a priori that , at the classical limit , each colors @xmath35 and each number of punctures @xmath95 are large for @xmath314 $ ] and check that this assumption is self - consistent . following the previous strategy for the study of the thermodynamical properties of the system of punctures , we fix the colors @xmath35 to large values and we consider the limit where the numbers @xmath95 become large .",
    "we suppose that all these numbers increase at the same velocity , i.e. we can write @xmath315 where @xmath316 are fixed and @xmath317 becomes larger and larger at the semi - classical limit .",
    "we will see that necessarily @xmath317 scales as @xmath318 where @xmath7 is the ( mean ) area of the horizon . in that case , the analytic continuation of the number of black hole microstates can be written as @xmath319 where the measure @xmath320 and the contour @xmath45 are the same as in the prior model ( [ one color action ] ) .",
    "the analysis of the large @xmath317 asymptotic is very analogous to what we have already done even if it is a bit more involved .",
    "for this reason , we will not detail the calculations here .",

    "when the colors are large ( what we are assuming from the begining ) , @xmath202 is very close to the pole @xmath179 and can be written as @xmath322 the expression of @xmath202 is similar to the one color model where the color @xmath57 is the arithmetic mean color .",
    "from now , we will neglect the term @xmath209 in the expression of @xmath207 because it will not play any role in the asymptotic of ( [ multi color integral ] ) .",

    ", the ( analytic continuation of the ) number of microstates depends only on the two variables @xmath57 and @xmath9 and not on the details of the punctures colors . as a result",
    ", the leading order term of the microcanonical entropy @xmath326 reproduces the area law as in the one color model .",
    "although , all the remarks we raised at the end of subsection ( [ saddle ] ) still hold . in particular ,",
    "to compute the quantum corrections of the entropy and to have a deeper physical interpretation of the model , it is necessary to study it in the framework of the grand canonical ensemble where we can naturally implement the indistinguishability .",
    "we start directly with the calculation of the grand canonical partition function . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the chemical potential @xmath46 is the same for all the punctures , i.e. @xmath46 does not depend on the color .",
    "if we use the usual notation @xmath293 for the fugacity , then the grand canonical partition function is given by @xmath327 where the degeneracy @xmath328 and the black hole energy @xmath329 are @xmath330 these two quantities have exactly the same expression as in the one color model .",
    "the novelties in the multi - colors model rely on the form of the gibbs factor and on the expression of the measure associated to the colors which is explicitly given by @xmath331 where @xmath114 is the standard lebesgue measure .",
    "the presence of the gibbs factor and the definition of this integral enable us to implement the indistinguishability of the punctures , but they make the calculation of @xmath332 ( even at the vicinity of the unruh temperature ) more involved , as we are going to see .",
    "to write the partition function is a simpler form , we first replace the measure ( [ measure on s ] ) by the standard multiple lebesgue measure @xmath333 then we perform the change of variables @xmath334 whose jacobian is given @xmath335 .",
    "this allows to simplify any integral of the form @xmath336 for any function @xmath337 of the variable @xmath57 only because @xmath338 . as the partition function ( [ partition multi ] )",
    "is an integral of the type ( [ changing variable ] ) , we can use such a formula to simplify its expression to the form @xmath339 with @xmath340 due to the presence of this coefficient in the series ( [ partition with c ] ) , we do not see how to simplify further the expression of the partition function without some approximations .",
    "but , as for the one dimensional model , we are exclusively interested in the behavior of the partition function at the vicinity of the unruh temperature ( where the quantum to classical phase transition occurs ) . fortunately , we can replace @xmath341 by its large @xmath9 asymptotic to get the behavior of the partition function when @xmath131 : we can show that @xmath342 as @xmath343 . as a consequence , at the semi - classical limit",
    ", the grand canonical partition function behaves as @xmath344 following the same strategy as for the one color black hole model , we obtain immediately @xmath345 and @xmath118 as previously ( [ variable q ] ) .",
    "the expression of this asymptotic is very similar to the one color black hole model one and is given by @xmath346 at the vicinity of the unruh temperature . as in the previous subsections",
    ", we now take @xmath347 as the grand canonical partition function . in that case , the mean ( total ) number of punctures @xmath9 , the mean ( average ) color @xmath57 and the mean area @xmath7 are given by : @xmath348 as a conclusion , at the thermodynamical limit , the black hole area becomes macroscopic together with the total number of punctures and the average color . hence , the results obtained in the one color black hole are still valid when the punctures are colored with an arbitrary but finite number of colors . in particular , the grand canonical entropy is given by ( [ grand entropy ] ) and reproduces the area law with logarithmic corrections when the chemical potential is fixed to @xmath3 : @xmath349 in this formula , we see that the logarithmic corrections depend on the number of colors @xmath60 , and we get the coefficient @xmath308 only for the one color black hole model . this coefficient is the one that appears in the context of real ( the barbero - immirzi parameter is real ) black holes in loop quantum gravity , and also in other approaches to black holes thermodynamics . as the one color black hole is the only that reproduces the  expected \" logarithmic corrections , it has something special .",
    "in fact , it would correspond to a spherical symmetric quantum black hole , and maybe , implementing the spherical symmetry at the quantum level , would lead to the requirement that all the punctures are colored by the same representation .",
    "however , to understand properly the role of @xmath60 , we should study the asymptotic of the partition function with an arbitrary large number of colors .",
    "we leave this study for future investigations .",
    "the content of this article is twofold . on the one hand ,",
    "we construct , in a mathematically rigorous way , the analytic continuation of the number of microstates of a spherical black hole in loop quantum gravity from real values to complex values of the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath0 ( in fact , our analysis is limited to @xmath79 which is the physically relevant case ) . on the other hand",
    ", we study the semi - classical properties of the associated statistical system .    for a given microscopic black hole configuration ( defined by a family of integers @xmath40 ) ,",
    "the number of black hole microstates is given by the dimension of the chern - simons theory hilbert space on a punctured 2-sphere .",
    "hence , it is a function of the chern - simons level @xmath6 and of the integers @xmath40 .",
    "the analytic continuation relies on an expression of this dimension as a complex integral along a given contour @xmath45 of a holomorphic function . with this formulation at hand ,",
    "the analytic continuation to @xmath350 becomes well defined , and consists in taking @xmath6 and @xmath40 purely imaginary , which is a consequence of going from @xmath0 real to @xmath79 .",
    "we argue that the analytic continuation is unique up to a discrete ambiguity in the choice of the contour @xmath45 .",
    "only one choice of contour leads to the area law at the semi - classical limit , and fortunately this choice is the simplest and somehow the most natural . as a consequence , this defines the number of microstates of the  complex \" black hole in loop quantum gravity .",
    "nonetheless , it would be very interesting to find another independent argument to justify our choice of contour .",
    "such a result is a mathematical justification of the  naive \" continuation originally in @xcite .",
    "it is very interesting to enhance that the intuitive analytic continuation ( @xcite ) reproduced in fact the correct result not only at the leading order but also at the first subleading order , even if the regulator @xmath89 ( [ asymp naive ] ) was unknown .",
    "it would be instructive to establish a link between our construction and the one proposed recently by han in @xcite .",
    "once we have constructed the number of microstates for a complex black hole , we can study its statistical and thermodynamical properties .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case where the number of punctures is arbitrary but finite . following @xcite ,",
    "we compute the grand canonical partition function where the energy is defined  la frodden - gosh - perez @xcite from the point of view of an observer located close to the horizon , and the chemical potential @xmath46 is assumed to be identical for all the punctures .",
    "we show that a phase transition occurs at the unruh temperature @xmath1 .",
    "when the temperature tends to @xmath1 , the system becomes classical in the sense that the area becomes macroscopic together with the total number of punctures and the arithmetic mean of colors .",
    "we compute the entropy and show that it reproduces , as expected , the area law at the semi - classical limit with some quantum correction .",
    "wiith a very simple choice of the chemical potential , fixed to @xmath3 , the corrections are logarithmic .",
    "the fact that the punctures have a chemical potential means that when they disappear ( in an adiabatic process for instance ) they release energy .",
    "this could be interpreted as an evidence of black hole radiation .",
    "it would be very interesting to go further and to establish a clear link between the presence of a non - vanishing chemical potential and the new horizon radiation .",
    "note that the logarithmic corrections come with the  universal \" factor @xmath308 when all the punctures are colored with only one representation . considering a one color black hole could be interpreted as a quantization of a spherical black hole , and this might be the reason why we recover the expected logarithmic corrections in that case only .",
    "to finish , let us emphasize that the results of this article raise several questions and open interesting outlooks .",
    "the method we have developed ( the analytic continuation ) is generic and could be adapted to other situations than black holes .",
    "we expect to apply them to spin foam models and also to quantum cosmology to see how taking @xmath2 affects these models .",
    "furthermore , the analytic continuation techniques could provide us with new insights to solve the reality conditions and therefore to open a new hamiltonian quantization of gravity starting from complex ashtekar variables @xcite .",
    "we want to thank m. geiller and a. perez for their enthusiastic support .",
    "this appendix contains the details of the analysis of the critical points of the action @xmath56 @xmath351 where @xmath316 are constant and @xmath60 is the number of colors .",
    "this analysis is necessary to understand the large @xmath317 expansion of the integral @xmath352 the integration contour has been illustrated in figure ( [ contour ] ) .",
    "the structure of the critical points in the complex plane has been illustrated in ( [ cplus ] ) .",
    "( one puncture ) for two different values of the representation @xmath41 .",
    "more precisely , they represent @xmath353 as a function of @xmath354 .",
    "when @xmath41 is an integer ( here @xmath355 ) , the critical points are located on the imaginary axe .",
    "when @xmath41 is imaginary , there are two types of critical points : the ones located on the real axe , and the ones located on the imaginary axe .",
    "the contribution to the semi - classical limit of the imaginary critical points is clearly more important than the contribution of the real ones .",
    "all these observations are proven in this appendix .",
    "the red line represents the component @xmath169 of the integration contour illustrated in the picture ( [ contour ] ) . ]",
    "we will start with the simple case where @xmath356 and then we will generalize to an arbitrary number of punctures .",
    "moreover , we will study the cases where @xmath40 are integer and @xmath66 are purely imaginary .",

    "notice that we will not study the general case where @xmath41 is any complex number .",
    "let us assume that the color @xmath41 is an integer ( @xmath362 ) .",
    "first , we show that the solutions of ( [ critical equation ] ) are either real or purely imaginary . to show this is indeed the case , we decompose @xmath354 in terms of its real and imaginary parts and , using @xmath363 we obtain the relation @xmath364 this implies necessarily the equality between the phases of the complex numbers in the r.h.s . and in the l.h.s .",
    "of the equation , i.e. : @xmath365 if @xmath366 and @xmath367 are not vanishing .",
    "we obtain an equation of the form @xmath368 where @xmath369 and @xmath370 .",
    "furthermore , the minimum of @xmath371 is reached only once when @xmath253 , hence the solutions of ( [ critical equation ] ) are necessarily in the real axe or in the imaginary axe .",
    "furthermore , there is no non - zero real solutions .",
    "therefore , all the solutions are purely imaginary i.e. @xmath372 with @xmath373 which admits an infinity number of solutions .",
    "trivially , if @xmath374 is a solution , @xmath375 is solution for any @xmath376 .",

    "however , the critical points @xmath382 and @xmath383 contribute the most because the action is maximal ( when @xmath384 ) at these points .",
    "in fact , by symmetry , these two contributions are totally identical , hence the large @xmath9 behavior of the integral is obtained from the saddle point approximation at the vicinity of @xmath382 , i.e. : @xmath385 where @xmath386 the integration is necessarily defined along the imaginary axe for convergence issues .",
    "hence , we set @xmath387 and we obtain @xmath388 as a consequence , the corresponding entropy admits the following large @xmath9 expansion : @xmath389 using the expression of the horizon area @xmath390 , we recover the large @xmath7 expansion of the black entropy which contains a term proportional to @xmath7 and logarithmic corrections .",
    "we need a suitable choice of @xmath0 to reproduce the semi - classical area law whereas the logarithm corrections are universal and given by @xmath59 .",
    "this closes the study of the discrete case .",
    "let us now assume that the color @xmath391 with @xmath392 for instance .",
    "we are going to show that the critical points are still either real or purely imaginary as in the previous case . to see this is indeed the case , we write the equation ( [ critical xy ] ) replacing @xmath41 by @xmath393 : @xmath394 the r.h.s . and the l.h.s .",

    "we used the principal evaluation of the logarithm with the cut on the negative real half - line .",
    "therefore , among the real critical points , @xmath404 contributes the most at the semi - classical limit and the other contributions are suppressed . using the saddle point approximation , we know that the @xmath404 contribution to the large @xmath9 expansion of the integral ( [ int appendix ] ) is ( up to the oscillating phase ) governed by the evaluation of the real part of @xmath405 at this point , namely @xmath406 .",

    "we can neglect the contribution of all the other critical points .",
    "to finish this part , let us again point of that we have not considered the critical points @xmath415 with @xmath186 due to our choice of contour .",
    "another choice would have selected another critical point which in turn would have implied a different ( larger ) asymptotic behavior .",
