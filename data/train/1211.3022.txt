    "in this paper we consider a time - periodic ode of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 for all @xmath2 with a fixed period @xmath3 , and study the basin of attraction of a periodic solution .",
    "the basin of attraction can be computed using a variety of methods : * invariant manifolds * form the boundaries of basins of attraction , and their computation can thus be used to find a basin of attraction @xcite .",
    "however , this method needs additional arguments to ensure that a certain region is the basin of attraction of an attractor , and that , for example , there are no other attractors in that region . other approaches to compute the basin of attraction are for example the * cell mapping approach * @xcite or * set oriented methods * @xcite which divide the phase space into cells and compute the dynamics between these cells .    * lyapunov functions * @xcite are a natural way of analysing the basin of attraction , since they start from the attractive solution , not from the boundary .",
    "moreover , through their level sets , they give additional information about the basin of attraction than just the boundary . *",
    "converse theorems * which guarantee the existence of a lyapunov function under certain conditions have been given by many authors , for an overview see @xcite .",
    "however , all converse theorems offer no general method to analytically construct lyapunov functions .    recently",
    ", several methods to construct lyapunov functions have been proposed : hafstein @xcite constructed a piecewise affine lyapunov function using * linear programming*. parrilo @xcite and papachristodoulou and prajna in @xcite consider the numerical construction of lyapunov functions that are presentable as sum of squares of polynomials ( * sos * ) for autonomous polynomial systems .",
    "these ideas have been taken further by recent publications of peet @xcite and peet and papachristodoulou @xcite , where the existence of a polynomial lyapunov function on bounded regions for exponentially stable systems in proven .    a different method deals with * zubov s equation * and computes a solution of this partial differential equation ( pde ) . in camilli",
    "@xcite , zubov s method was extended to control problems .",
    "giesl considered a particular lyapunov function satisfying a linear pde which was solved using * meshless collocation * , in particular radial basis functions @xcite .",
    "this method has been extended to time - periodic odes @xcite .",
    "lyapunov functions attain their minimum on the attractor and have a negative orbital derivative for all points in the basin of attraction apart from the attractor .",
    "hence , it is necessary to have * exact information * about the attractor in the phase space before one can compute a lyapunov function . whereas this information might be easy to obtain in special examples , in general this information is not available .    *",

    "borg s criterion *    another method to characterise the basin of attraction , introduced by borg @xcite , uses a local contraction property and does * not * require information about the periodic orbit .",

    "this is equivalent to the condition that the symmetric matrix @xmath22 is negative definite .",
    "as this is a linear matrix inequality , it can be formulated as a constraint of a semidefinite optimization problem .    while the sufficiency of this local contraction criterion in the autonomous case goes back to @xcite ,",
    "its necessity was shown in @xcite .",
    "the method was extended to time - periodic systems @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this method over , for example , lyapunov functions , is that it does not require information about the position of the periodic orbit .",
    "moreover , the criterion is robust to small errors .",
    "although the existence of riemannian metrics has been shown @xcite , it remains a difficult problem to construct them for concrete examples .",
    "this is a similar problem to the construction of a ( scalar - valued ) lyapunov function , but borg s criterion requires the construction of a matrix - valued function @xmath4 . in the two - dimensional autonomous case",
    ", however , there exists a special riemannian metric of the form @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a scalar - valued function @xcite .",
    "this can be used to find an approximation using radial basis functions @xcite . in higher dimensions , however , the existence of such a special riemannian metric is not true in general @xcite . in @xcite , a combination of a riemannian",
    "metric locally near the periodic orbit with a lyapunov function further away was used , and the construction was again achieved by radial basis functions .",
    "this method , however , heavily depends on information about the periodic orbit , which was obtained by a numerical approximation of the periodic orbit and its variational equation . in this paper",
    ", we will develop a new method to construct a riemannian metric to fulfill borg s criterion , which will use semidefinite optimization and does not require any information about the periodic orbit .",
    "* semidefinite optimization *    a semidefinite optimization problem for the variables @xmath25 is of the form @xmath26where @xmath27 are symmetric @xmath28 matrices and @xmath29 means that the matrix @xmath30 is positive semidefinite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to formulate the condition of a contraction metric as a semidefinite optimization ( feasibility ) problem . in a subsequent paper",
    "we will discuss the details of how to solve this problem efficiently .",
    "the main idea is to first triangulate the phase space .",
    "the riemannian metric , i.e. the symmetric matrix @xmath4 , will be expressed as a continuous piecewise affine ( cpa ) function , i.e. if @xmath11 is given at the vertices @xmath31 of a simplex , then @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "the conditions of borg s criterion will become the constraints of a semidefinite optimization problem on the vertices of the triangulation , which will ensure the contraction property for * all * points in the simplices .    in @xcite , a contraction metric is also constructed using semidefinite optimization .",
    "there are , however , three main differences to our approach : firstly , adjacent trajectories in * all * directions are contracted , whereas in our case the contraction takes place in the @xmath34-dimensional subspace @xmath35 of @xmath36 , but not in the time - direction . thus , in our case , the attractor is a periodic orbit , whereas in their case , it is an equilibrium point .",
    "secondly , and more importantly , the above paper transforms the construction problem to a linear matrix inequality and solves this using a sum - of - squares approach .",
    "this approach is used to prove global stability , i.e. the basin of attraction is the whole space .",
    "the contraction metric is a polynomial function , and the system considered is assumed to be polynomial , too . in this paper , we study systems which are not necessarily polynomial nor globally stable , and we triangulate the phase space to obtain a large subset of the basin of attraction .",
    "lastly , we are able to prove that the semidefinite optimization problem is feasible if and only if the dynamical system has an exponentially stable periodic orbit , whereas in their paper the equivalence does not hold since the sum - of - squares condition is more restrictive than positive definiteness of matrices .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section [ sec0 ] we start with preliminaries , and in section [ sec1 ] we generalise the existing theorem for a smooth riemannian metric @xmath11 to a cpa ( continuous piecewise affine ) riemannian contraction metric .",
    "we show that the existence of such a metric is sufficient to prove existence and uniqueness of a periodic orbit and to determine a subset of its basin of attraction . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we describe the triangulation of the phase space into a simplicial complex and state the semidefinite optimization problem .",
    "furthermore , we show that the feasibility of the semidefinite optimization problem provides us with a cpa contraction metric .",
    "we also discuss a possible objective function to obtain a bound on the largest floquet exponent . in section [ sec3 ] , finally",
    ", we show that the semidefinite problem is feasible , if the dynamical system has an exponentially stable periodic orbit .",
    "altogether , this paper shows that the problem of finding a contraction metric is equivalent to the feasibility of a semidefinite optimization problem .",
