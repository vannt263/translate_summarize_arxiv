    "since the discovery of x - ray emission from star - forming regions ( sfrs ) using the einstein observatory in the 1980 s @xcite , low - mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) have been known to be strong x - ray emitters .",
    "subsequent x - ray observatories further revealed that almost all low - mass ysos in the class  i  iii evolutionally stages emit x - rays and the emission originates from optically - thin thermal plasma with fast rises and slow decays in flux .",
    "these lead to the general consensus that x - rays from low - mass ysos are attributable to high temperature ( @xmath2=10@xmath310@xmath4k ) plasma maintained by occasional flares that are triggered by magnetic reconnections ( see a review by @xcite ) .",
    "recent long - exposure observations by the chandra x - ray observatory are beginning to reveal new x - ray - emitting phenomena in sfrs with its unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution .",
    "these include the x - ray detection from a herbig - haro object @xcite and the discovery of diffuse x - ray emission from high - mass sfrs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we conducted a @xmath0100ks observation on orion molecular clouds 2 and 3 ( omc-2/3 ; @xmath5=450pc ) with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) onboard chandra @xcite in conjunction with deep near - infrared ( nir ) follow - up imaging using the university of hawaii 88 inch telescope @xcite . among 385 x - ray detections",
    ", we found that @xmath072% sources have a nir counterpart while the remaining sources have none .",
    "based on the x - ray spectral and temporal properties as well as the spatial distribution and the _ k_-band luminosity function of these sources , we concluded that most of the nir - identified and nir - unidentified x - ray sources are ysos and background active galactic nuclei , respectively .    among the nir - unidentified x - ray sources , however ,",
    "a few coincide spatially with the string of protostellar clumps in omc-3 ( mms110 ) seen in 1.3 mm continuum emission @xcite .",
    "the hard x - ray emission ( source no.8 in @xcite ; we hereafter call this source tkh8 ) detected at the protostellar clump mms2 is one of these peculiar x - ray sources .",
    "its associations with the protostellar clump , with molecular outflows in co , hco@xmath6 @xcite , and shock - excited h@xmath7 @xcite emission lines , and with protostellar jets in centimeter continuum @xcite , make this source unlikely to be a background source .",
    "it is also unlikely that this x - ray emission is from the magnetic activity of a low - mass class  i ",
    "iii objects because the x - ray emission is centered at a position that is significantly ( @xmath012 ) offset from the closest nir sources ( irs3 and irs5 ; @xcite ) .",
    "these results lead @xcite and @xcite to speculate that this x - ray emission is from a hidden class  0 protostar , which is invisible by definition at nir wavelengths @xcite .",
    "we have carried out the highest - resolution centimeter imaging observation yet of tkh8 using the very large array ( vla ) to investigate further the nature of this peculiar source .",
    "given the fact that most protostars show free - free emission originating from protostellar jets @xcite , long - baseline interferometer imaging at centimeter wavelengths is the most accurate method of determining the position of jet - exciting sources , and the strength and orientation of the jet at its root .",
    "a d - configuration observation has already detected a 3.6 cm source at tkh8 @xcite , although its coarse spatial resolution is insufficient to match the chandra image . in this paper",
    ", we report the result of our a - configuration vla observation of tkh8 , based on which we present another interpretation of the x - ray emission .",
    "we observed tkh8 with the vla of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) on february 11 , 2002 .",
    "we used the a - configuration to achieve sufficient spatial resolution to match that of the chandra image .",
    "a 3.6 cm map was obtained with an integration time of @xmath03.5 hours and the phase center at r.a.@xmath8 , decl.@xmath8 ( j2000.0 ) .",
    "the map is sensitive to structure smaller than @xmath02  with an angular resolution of @xmath001 .",
    "this enables us to have a much finer view of the x - ray emission and its vicinity compared to the prior d - configuration observation , which had a resolution of @xmath08  @xcite .",
    "3c48 ( 3.25jy ) and 0541@xmath9056 ( 0.98jy ) were used as the flux and phase calibrators , respectively .",
    "data reduction , calibration and analysis were performed using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "the naturally - weighted map is shown in figure  [ fg : f1 ] .",
    "we detected two sources ( vla1a and vla1b ) above the 3@xmath10 level , for which we derived the position and the flux density ( table [ tb : t1 ] ) .",
    "these two sources were not resolved in the prior d - configuration observation and were named altogether as vla1 @xcite .",
    "we detected @xmath070% of the total flux measured in the d configuration , indicating that we are missing some extended emission associated with vla1 .",
    "vla1a is slightly extended , so we also determined the length of the major ( minor ) axis and position angle to be 040 ( 009 ) and 32.2  degree , respectively .",
    "the direction of the elongation is shown with the arrow in figure  [ fg : f1 ] .",

    "vla1a and vla1b are very close to the nir sources irs5 and irs3 , respectively @xcite . the apparent separation between irs5 and vla1a ( @xmath001 ) and between irs3 and vla1b ( @xmath0007 )",
    "are smaller than the nir position uncertainty of @xmath001 .",
    "thus , the nir and radio sources are most likely coincident .",
    "both irs3 and irs5 can be classified as class  i protostars from their nir excess and high extinction of @xmath1350  mag using the ( _ h__k_)/(_k___l__@xmath14 ) color - color diagram ( figure  3b in @xcite ) .",
    "the excess emission was also confirmed at the mid - infrared bands , securing the class  i nature of these sources @xcite .    for the following four reasons ,",
    "we conclude that both vla1a and vla1b are free - free emission from h@xmath15 regions ionized by the uv radiation from the shock front produced by a protostellar jet propagating through ambient matter @xcite .",
    "first , these centimeter sources are accompanied by class  i protostars ( irs3 and irs5 ) .",
    "embedded protostars are frequently associated with centimeter emission .",
    "detailed studies indicate that most of these radio sources , if not all , are jet - induced free - free emission @xcite .",

    "j__@xmath16 11.3  mag and _ j__h _ @xmath17 3.8  mag , respectively @xcite .",
    "this indicates that both sources have a mass less than 2@xmath18 , which rules out the possibility that the centimeter emission is from h@xmath15 regions generated by stellar uv photons .",
    "third , the flux density multiplied by the square of the distance to the source from an observer ( @xmath19 ) and the momentum rate in the outflow ( @xmath20 ) of vla1a and vla1b fit well with a known empirical relation @xcite and theoretical understanding @xcite of the jet - induced model .",
    "figure  [ fg : f2 ] shows the relation between @xmath19 and @xmath20 for 16 embedded objects , where we added vla1a / b with @xmath21mjykpc@xmath22 ( this work ) and @xmath23@xmath18yr@xmath1kms@xmath1 @xcite . here",
    ", the limited spatial resolution of the hco@xmath6 and co observations in @xcite did not resolve which of the three 1.3 mm clumps ( mms2mms4 ; @xcite ) is responsible for the molecular outflow .",
    "however , vla1a and vla1b in mms2 are the only 3.6 cm sources that are associated with mms2mms4 ( this work ; @xcite ) . we therefore safely assumed that the @xmath20 value determined for this molecular outflow represents the sum of the momentum rate from vla1a and vla1b .",
    "similarly , we summed the flux density of vla1a and vla1b for the @xmath24 value .",
    "fourth , in case of vla1a , the source is elongated ( the arrow in figure  [ fg : f1 ] ) in the direction of the global outflow seen in the h@xmath25  s(1)-band ( @xcite ; the main stream emanating from vla 1a/1b in figure  [ fg : f3 ] ) , which is characteristic of free - free centimeter emission induced by jets @xcite .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure2.eps    ( 80mm,52mm)figure3.eps      the poor photon statistics of the hard x - ray source tkh8 do not allow us to examine whether this is an extended source . however , with the assumption that it is a point - like source , the x - ray emission is significantly offset from the class  i protostars ( irs3 and irs5 ; @xcite ) .",
    "our high - resolution radio map enables us to confirm that the displacement is in the direction of the jet and outflow .",
    "we discuss the origin of this x - ray emission together with the centimeter emission based on a jet - induced scenario .",
    "figure  [ fg : f4 ] shows a schematic view , where the hard x - rays are emitted from the post shock ( ps ) region , while the centimeter emission is from the recombination zone ( rz ) behind the shock front .",
    "the rz is maintained by the continuous ionization by uv photons from the ps region .    in ps ,",

    "when @xmath30 is large enough , we can expect to have x - ray emission from ps . assuming that light elements are fully ionized in ps , the emission measure ( @xmath32 ) is given with the electron density ( @xmath27 ) and the volume ( @xmath33 ) of ps as @xmath34.\\label{eq : e3}\\ ] ] we fitted the x - ray spectrum of tkh8 with an optically - thin thermal plasma model with the amount of interstellar absorption , plasma temperature , and emission measure as free parameters , obtaining an acceptable fit with @xmath35@xmath36 , @xmath37kev , and @xmath38@xmath39 .",
    "readers should note , however , that these parameters are not well constrained due to the poor x - ray photon statistics of this source , which can bring a large uncertainty in the following calculations . using the best - fit values",
    ", we derive @xmath40kms@xmath1 and @xmath41@xmath39 . here",
    ", we assumed that ps is a cube at a distance of 450pc with the length of 05 ( @xmath8 the pixel scale of acis ) .",
    "the radio observations give us another constraint on the values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 as shown below . in rz , the centimeter intensity ( @xmath24 )",
    "is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the axis lengths of the extended centimeter source and @xmath45 is the temperature in rz @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath46 approaches @xmath47 in the optically - thin limit , which is expressed in terms of the shock parameters @xcite as @xmath48 by substituting the observed values for vla1a ( @xmath498.3ghz , @xmath50mjy , @xmath51040 , and @xmath52009 ) as typical values and assuming that @xmath53k , we obtain @xmath54    from the x - ray observations , we can independently derive that @xmath55 these values are in a good agreement with each other within a factor of a few , supporting the protostellar jet scenario for the origin of the x - ray and centimeter emission .",
    "( 80mm,48mm)figure4.eps      similar x - ray emission was recently reported by @xcite from l1551 irs5 , in which an x - ray source detected by chandra is located at the base of the protostellar jet .",
    "they argued three possibilities as the origin of the x - rays , including x - rays from fast shocks . applying our scenario to this source using the x - ray observables",
    "given in @xcite and the centimeter observables in @xcite , we found that the discussion in sect.[sec : s3 - 2 ] also holds for this source with @xmath56500kms@xmath1 .",
    "this velocity is reinforced by @xcite , who present nir echelle spectroscopy results on the [ fe@xmath15 ] outflow from this source , and indicate the existence of a high velocity component reaching 400500kms@xmath1 .",
    "a recent series of works using [ fe@xmath15 ] spectroscopy detected a highly - collimated high velocity component exceeding @xmath0200kms@xmath1 in protostar outflows , including dg tau ( 250300kms@xmath1 ; @xcite ) and hl tau ( @xmath0250kms@xmath1 ; t - s .",
    "pyo , private communication ) . in optical jet observations , fs tau b was measured both in radial velocity and proper motion , giving a jet velocity of @xmath0400kms@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "future x - ray observations of these systems with active jets are needed , to enrich the sample and examine the correlation between x - ray and centimeter observables , in order to test our idea .",
    "protostellar jets at a speed of 5001000kms@xmath1 may sound extreme .",
    "however , such a high velocity should not be surprising if we consider that even a herbig - haro object , which is far away from its powering source , is emitting x - rays induced by a @xmath0200kms@xmath1 shock @xcite , and also that solar coronal mass ejections are frequently observed to be propagating at @xmath581000kms@xmath1 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of detection of 5001000kms@xmath1 jets so far does not prove their non - existence but simply means we have had no tools to measure them .",
    "if this picture is established , we will obtain a strong method to derive the speed of highest velocity component of protostellar jets from x - ray imaging - spectroscopy using equation ( [ eq : e1 ] ) , with no dependence on the inclination angle unlike proper motion or doppler shift measurements .",
    "we consider more observations of similar sources will boost our understanding of this phenomenon , and eventually , of forming stars .",
    "* we have made a high - resolution 3.6 cm imaging observation of a hard x - ray emission source ( tkh8 ) associated with a protostellar clump ( mms2 ) in omc-3 with the vla .",
    "two vla sources were detected , both of which have the nir counterparts . *",
    "the centimeter emission is concluded to be free - free emission produced by a protostellar jet based on ( 1 )  the association with class  i protostars , ( 2 )  the low - mass nature of these protostars , ( 3 )  the relation between the centimeter flux density and the momentum rate of the outflow , and ( 4 )  the elongated structure aligned with the global outflow . * the hard x - ray source is located @xmath012  offset in the direction of the protostellar jet and outflow from the nir sources .",
    "the origin of the hard x - ray emission was discussed in the framework of jet - induced shocks . the x - ray and",
    "the centimeter observations give independent constraints on the shock parameters , which are found to be consistent with each other .",
    "we would like to thank tae - soo pyo for updated information on fast outflow observations .",
