    "in parametric down - conversion , a pump photon of frequency @xmath0 incident on a medium with a second - order nonlinear susceptibility @xmath1 is split into two photons with lower frequency  @xcite .",
    "spontaneous parametric down conversion produces photon pairs that can be entangled in many degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "the resulting two - photon state , consisting of a signal photon at frequency @xmath2 and an idler photon at frequeny @xmath3 , is often called a biphoton . upon post - selection on the idler photons ,",
    "the process provides a source of heralded single photons which represent the principal resource in many quantum information processing protocols like quantum cryptography  @xcite or linear optics quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "quantum networks have been proposed  @xcite that rely on stationary atoms or ions as information processing nodes and on single photons to transmit information via optical fibers .",
    "first building blocks of this scheme have already been realized  @xcite . for an efficient atom - photon coupling , the photon bandwidth has to match the linewidth of the atomic transition which is by orders of magnitude smaller than the bandwidth of the photons emitted in spontaneous parametric down - conversion .    in order to reduce the photon bandwidth ,",
    "cavity - enhanced parametric down - conversion can be applied .",
    "a bright source of heralded narrow - band single photons was experimentally realized  @xcite using a double - resonant optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) .",
    "the nonlinear crystal was placed inside a cavity resonant for both the signal and the idler field , and in the output a single narrow - band longitudinal signal mode was selected with an external frequency filter . clearly , to conditionally achieve single - photon generation , the opo has to be operated in the regime far below threshold where the production rate of down - converted photons is small compared to the loss rate of the cavity .",
    "a number of preceding experiments for biphoton generation in a double - resonant opo far below threshold have been performed  @xcite , and the first theoretical description was given in ref .",
    "recently , the theory of the double - resonant opo has been extended by analyzing the conditionally prepared single - photon state  @xcite , and by providing a multi - mode treatment which is valid for both pulsed and stationary pump fields  @xcite .    to ensure reliable operation of a quantum network , continuous photon emission over a long period of time is essential .",
    "for this purpose , an active stabilization of the opo is necessary which proves to be a complicated task in the double - resonant case while it is easier to achieve for a single - resonant cavity .",
    "continuous biphoton generation in a single - resonant opo far below threshold has recently been demonstrated in our group  @xcite using a setup where only the signal mode experiences resonance enhancement in the cavity while the orthogonally polarized idler mode is nonresonant due to deflection by an intra - cavity polarizing beam splitter .",
    "additional passive filtering with the help of an external cavity can select a single longitudinal mode and will thus enable the generation of narrow - band single photons .    to our knowledge , a theoretical treatment of the single - resonant opo far below threshold has not been performed so far . the present paper aims to fill this gap . based on the concepts of the pioneering theoretical studies of spontaneous parametric down - conversion  @xcite",

    "<S> we present a quantum - theoretical treatment of biphoton generation in single - resonant type - ii parametric down - conversion . the nonlinear medium is continuously pumped and is placed inside a cavity which is resonant for the signal field , but nonresonant for the idler deflected by an intra - cavity polarizing beam splitter . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of the classical pump is assumed to be sufficiently low in order to yield a biphoton production rate that is small compared to the cavity loss rate . </S>",
    "<S> explicit expressions are derived for the rate of biphoton generation and for the biphoton wave function . </S>",
    "<S> the output spectra of the signal and idler field are determined , as well as the second - order signal - idler cross - correlation function which is shown to be asymmetric with respect to the time delay . due to frequency entanglement in the signal - idler photon pair </S>",
    "<S> , the idler spectrum is found to reveal the longitudinal mode structure of the cavity , even though the idler field is not resonant . </S>"
