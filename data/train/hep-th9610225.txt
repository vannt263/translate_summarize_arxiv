    "chiral transitions can occur in ( non - abelian ) gauge theories coupled to fermions .",
    "these transitions can be continuous or discontinuous depending on the specific dynamics of the model .",
    "if the up and down quark masses were exactly zero , we expect the real world to undergo such a transition at a finite temperature .",
    "it is further believed that the order of chiral transitions crucially depends on the number of quark flavors@xcite .",
    "if the strange quark was sufficiently light , the phase transition in the real world could be first order .",
    "these possibilities have created a lot of interest in studying chiral transitions in lattice simulations@xcite .",
    "our theoretical understanding of such transitions is essentially based on universality arguments@xcite , which have worked quite well for many condensed matter systems .",
    "the present evidence from lattice simulations supports the predictions of universality . however , recently there have been some concerns@xcite regarding the validity of such arguments for fermionic systems .",
    "further , even if universality arguments are valid , there exist dynamics specific to the gauge fields that can be important near the transition and can not be determined in the universal model .",
    "for example , it is well known that anomalous axial symmetry breaking effects can play an important role in determining the order of the transition@xcite .",
    "recent lattice simulations @xcite have suggested a rapid evolution in the anomalous symmetry breaking effects close to the chiral transition .",
    "thus it is useful to understand the dynamics of the gauge fields that are responsible for chiral symmetry restoration . as a step in this direction it can be useful to study simplified models , that have some non - trivial gauge dynamics .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking in gauge theories is closely connected to the small eigenvalue density of the dirac operator .",
    "recently some progress has been made in understanding the spectrum of small eigenvalues of the dirac operator in qcd@xcite .",
    "the models that have been studied are the so called random matrix models .",
    "such models are motivated by the chiral symmetries of the dirac operator .",
    "it is possible that these models incorporate some dynamics of gauge fields at a crude level .",
    "when such models are extended@xcite to include finite temperature effects , one obtains a chiral transition .",
    "an interesting feature of the random matrix models is that the dynamical variable is typically an @xmath2 matrix .",
    "the transitions are obtained in the thermodynamic limit which involves taking @xmath3 to infinity . in this sense",
    ", these can be regarded as large @xmath3 transitions of a matrix model .",
    "a question that immediately strikes is whether there exist other known large n transitions that can be interpreted as a chiral transition with an appropriate extension . in this article",
    "we show that one can construct a chiral transition based on the large n transition discovered by gross and witten@xcite and wadia@xcite independently .",
    "they showed that the two dimensional @xmath0 lattice gauge theory with the wilson gauge action , has a large @xmath3 transition essentially due to the non - analytic behavior of a single plaquette integral . consequently the pure @xmath0 lattice gauge theory with the wilson gauge action has a third order phase transition separating strong and weak couplings .",
    "in the present work we show that , if we consider only a single plaquette , it is possible to include fermionic variables on the corners of the plaquette and turn the transition into a chiral transition . in the next two sections we define the theory",
    "more precisely and solve it in the large n limit , showing the existence of the chiral transition . in the final section",
    "we make some observations on the results obtained .",
    "the theory we are considering is the well known one plaquette model , which consists of four @xmath2 unitary matrices living on the sides of a square(plaquette ) . to this",
    "we add grassmann n - vectors , @xmath4,@xmath5 associated to the corners @xmath6",
    ". we will refer to them as fermionic variables as opposed to the unitary matrices that will be referred to as gauge(or link ) variables .",
    "the unitary matrix that connects the adjacent corners @xmath7and @xmath8 will be represented as @xmath9 .",
    "the theory is described by the action @xmath10\\;=\\ ; -{1\\over g^2}tr(u_p+u_p^\\dagger ) -   \\chib_n ( d_{nm}+m \\delta_{nm } ) \\chi_m,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 .",
    "note that the sign in front of the gauge action is natural from lattice qcd .",
    "the operator @xmath12 couples the fermionic variables on adjacent cites .",
    "we will refer to @xmath12 as the dirac operator in the present model .",
    "the non - zero components of the operator @xmath13 are given by @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , with the anti - hermitian property that @xmath18 .",
    "thus in the matrix notation we have @xmath19 the factors @xmath20 and @xmath21 could be thought of as extra couplings in the theory . in order to fix these couplings we use the analogy with staggered fermions .",
    "such factors occur naturally in the staggered fermion formulation@xcite as phase factors which are remnants of gamma matrices . in two",
    "dimension one encounters phase factors denoted by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 represents the direction and @xmath24 the lattice site .",
    "for example one can chose @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the well known staggered fermion action is then given by @xmath27 in the present model since we have a plaquette , we can think of it as an object in two dimension . restricting the staggered fermion action eq.([eq : stagg ] ) to a single plaquette the factors @xmath20 and @xmath28 can be naturally associated with @xmath22 . using this connection",
    "we obtain one choice of the factors to be @xmath29 we will see that with the definition of the plaquette action given in eq.([eq : plaqact ] ) , the above choice of the @xmath30 factors is necessary for the existence of the chiral transition .",
    "we can now define the partition function of the theory by the usual integral over the gauge and fermionic variables @xmath31[d\\chi][d\\chib]\\;\\exp(-s[u,\\chi,\\chib]).\\ ] ] it is obvious by construction that the theory is gauge invariant in the the usual sense .",
    "further the model also has a chiral symmetry , given by @xmath32 in the chiral limit @xmath33 .",
    "this is the remnant of the chiral symmetry usually present in a staggered fermion formulation .",
    "this suggests that the chiral order parameter , @xmath34 , defined by @xmath35[d\\chi][d\\chib]\\;\\sum_n   { 1\\over n}\\chib_n\\chi_n\\;\\exp(-s[u,\\chi,\\chib]),\\ ] ] would vanish in the chiral limit",
    ". this will certainly be true for finite @xmath3 .",
    "however , as we will show below in the large n limit , the theory breaks chiral symmetry at strong couplings .",
    "further , the well known large n transition of the pure gauge theory restores the chiral symmetry in the weak coupling .",
    "we will follow the work gross and witten@xcite closely and calculate the chiral condensate defined in eq.([eq : chcond ] ) in the large n limit .",
    "it is important to recognize that the large n limit is not an approximation here , but is necessary for the transition .",
    "it is obvious that the above partition function will not show non - analytic properties when n is finite .",
    "further as usual the chiral limit must be considered only after the large n limit is taken .",
    "hence we are naturally lead to study the large n solution to the theory .    since the theory is gauge invariant we can go to a convenient gauge before doing the integrals .",
    "we will fix the gauge such that @xmath36 .",
    "this naturally imposes the constraint that @xmath37 . using the properties of the haar measure we obtain ,    @xmath38\\;{1\\over n}tr\\left({1\\over d+m}\\right ) \\exp\\left({1\\over g^2}tr(u_p+u_p^\\dagger)+tr\\;\\log\\;[d+m]\\right ) , \\\\ \\label{eq : chcond1b } z\\;&=&\\ ; \\int [ du_p]\\;\\exp\\left({1\\over g^2}tr(u_p+u_p^\\dagger)+tr\\;\\log\\;[d+m]\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the matrix @xmath12 is now given by @xmath39 where it is important to remember that each element in the above @xmath40 matrix is an @xmath2 matrix .",
    "the integrand in eq.([eq : chcond1a ] ) and eq.([eq : chcond1b ] ) only depends on the eigenvalues , @xmath41 of @xmath42 .",
    "this is obviously true for the part of the integrand that depends only on the trace of @xmath42 . to see that this is also true for the remaining terms that depend on the matrix @xmath12 , note that only eigenvalues of @xmath12 enter the integrand .",
    "it is easy to compute the eigenvalues of @xmath12 .",
    "firstly note that the only @xmath2 matrix in @xmath12 defined in eq.([eq : gfixd ] ) , that is not a multiple of unity is @xmath42 . thus using the matrix @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the @xmath2 matrix such that @xmath45 ; @xmath46 $ ] , it is possible to block diagonalize @xmath12 into @xmath40 matrices , @xmath47 , each of which",
    "is associated with one eigenvalue @xmath48 and is given by @xmath49 thus the eigenvalues of d turn out to be @xmath50 note that , due to the anti - hermitian nature of @xmath12 and the chiral symmetry discussed above , the eigenvalues are imaginary and come in pairs of opposite sign . clearly if @xmath51 @xmath52 and @xmath47 has zero eigenvalues .",
    "this connection between @xmath53 and zero eigenvalues of @xmath12 plays an important role in the existence of the chiral transition being discussed .",
    "the haar measure simplifies to @xmath54\\;=\\;\\hbox{const}\\;dt\\prod_i d\\alpha_i\\;\\tri^2(\\alpha_i)$ ] , where @xmath55 hence the integral over @xmath44 and various constants drop from expectation values such as the chiral condensate .",
    "further in the large @xmath3 limit , the integral is dominated by a single @xmath42 with a specific eigenvalue distribution .",
    "this distribution can be obtained using the saddle point condition , @xmath56 except for the second term on the left hand side , this is exactly the same equation as in @xcite .",
    "the extra term comes from the extra fermionic determinant in the present model . to get nontrivial results we take the @xmath1 limit while keeping @xmath57 fixed . in this limit",
    "the extra fermionic piece plays no role since it is suppressed by a power of @xmath3 , a familiar effect related to the usual suppression of fermions in the large @xmath58 limit .",
    "thus in the large @xmath3 limit the saddle point equation , eq.([eq : saddle ] ) , reduces to a continuum version that was studied in @xcite , namely @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a nondecreasing function in the range @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "this equation can be solved by introducing the eigenvalue density @xmath63 which is nonzero in the interval @xmath64 .",
    "we have introduced the subscript @xmath42 to distinguish this eigenvalue density from the one to be introduced shortly , namely the eigenvalue density of the operator @xmath12 .",
    "it is the latter that plays an interesting role in the calculation of the chiral condensate .",
    "borrowing the results from @xcite we have    [ eq : rhoup ] @xmath65,\\;\\ ;    \\rho_{u_p}(\\alpha)\\;&=&\\;{2\\over g\\pi}\\cos(\\alpha/2 ) [ \\sin^2(\\alpha_c/2)-\\sin^2(\\alpha/2)]^{1\\over 2},\\;\\ ;     where @xmath66 is equal to @xmath67 when @xmath68 and is given by @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "we can use these results now to calculate the chiral condensate . in the large @xmath3 limit one",
    "just has to evaluate @xmath71 $ ] in the background of @xmath42 whose eigenvalue distribution is given by eq.([eq : rhoup ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath72 where the values of @xmath12 , namely @xmath73 and @xmath74 are given by eq.([eq : eigen ] ) by just dropping the subscript @xmath75 .",
    "the reason for the chiral transition is now clear .",
    "since we need a non - zero density of small eigenvalues of @xmath12 , we need to understand the values of @xmath76 for which one obtains small eigenvalues of @xmath12 .",
    "note that @xmath73 is always non - zero , while @xmath74 can become zero when @xmath53 .",
    "thus for the chiral condensate to be non - zero in the chiral limit , we need values of @xmath76 close to @xmath53 to contribute . for strong coupling ,",
    "i.e. @xmath77 this is clearly possible .",
    "however for weak coupling , i.e. @xmath70 , one sees that @xmath78 for @xmath79 , which then suggests the possibility of the vanishing of chiral condensate .",
    "we define the eigenvalue density for the operator @xmath12 to be @xmath80 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath81 , where the first term is evaluated at @xmath82 and the second term is evaluated at @xmath83 @xmath84\\right)/ \\sqrt{4-\\lambda^2 } & \\;\\;\\;0\\leq\\lambda\\leq 2,\\;\\;\\ ; g \\geq 2 , \\\\",
    "{ 2\\lambda\\over g}\\sqrt{\\left(g/2-(1-\\lambda^2/2)^2\\right ) } & \\;\\;\\lambda_1\\leq\\lambda\\leq \\lambda_2,\\;\\;\\;g \\leq 2 , \\\\",
    "\\\\ 0 & \\hbox{otherwise } , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath85 and @xmath86 . in figure 1",
    "we plot @xmath80 for a few values of @xmath87 to illustrate the situation . using the definition of @xmath80 we can write the chiral condensate to be @xmath88 in the chiral limit we obtain @xmath89 .",
    "we see that for @xmath90 , and for @xmath91 .",
    "further , when @xmath92 , we obtain @xmath93 . if we naively read off the critical exponents we find @xmath94 and @xmath95 , quite different from mean field . however , since we do not know of any universality arguments applicable to the model , we need not take the exponents too seriously . further the underlying transition is a third order transition@xcite .",
    "some time ago it was shown by eguchi and kawai @xcite that in the large @xmath3 limit , @xmath0 lattice gauge theory in d dimensions can be reduced to a model on a d dimensional hypercube . if this could be done in the presence of staggered fermions one would obtain a model on the d dimensional hypercube . in the present work we have formulated a simple model on the plaquette by hand .",
    "thus it would be interesting to know if similar results can be obtained from the full 2-d theory in the spirit of the eguchi - kawai model where the final theory lives on the plaquette .",
    "more over we know , the underlying phase transition , responsible for the chiral transition just studied , is an artifact of the wilson action used for the plaquette variable .",
    "the phase transition can be eliminated if one uses the heat kernel action@xcite .",
    "this limits the applicability of the results obtained here .",
    "however , some qualitative features of a chiral transition can be motivated using this example .    on a crude level ,",
    "the results obtained here seem similar to the results of @xcite .",
    "first , the transition studied here is driven by the gauge dynamics .",
    "the fermion determinant does not play any role ; remember that in the large @xmath3 limit the fermion determinant dropped out of the saddle point equation eq.([eq : saddle ] ) .",
    "in other words , the chiral transition occurs even in the quenched theory .",
    "next , the density of eigenvalues of the dirac operator develops a gap for small eigenvalues above the transition ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "one might wonder if these are generic features of chiral transitions involving gauge fields . in qcd",
    ", it is well known that the number of flavors plays an important role in determining the order of the transition .",
    "for example , it is believed that for one flavor there is no chiral transition@xcite , due to the presence of the anomaly .",
    "this suggests that there will not be any transition in the quenched case , since the absence of the fermion determinant is likely to enhance the small eigenvalues of the dirac operator and enhance the effects of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "if this is true , we can expect the chiral transition to be driven mainly by the fermion determinant .",
    "it is through the fermion determinant that the number of flavors enters the problem .",
    "thus the present model and the random matrix models do not reflect these expected features of the qcd chiral phase transition .",
    "another interesting observation is the role of the staggered fermion phases defined in eq.([eq : phases ] ) .",
    "notice that in the weak coupling phase the gap in @xmath80 for small @xmath96 is related to the gap in the eigenvalue density @xmath97 at @xmath53 .",
    "this can be traced back to the zero eigenvalues of @xmath47 , defined in eq.([eq : blockd ] ) , which exist when @xmath51 as discussed in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "if we had chosen all the signs in eq.([eq : phases ] ) to be positive , the zero eigenvalues of @xmath47 would be related to @xmath98 . since this would not effect the saddle point equation , the density @xmath97 would not change . however , since the eigenvalues of @xmath12 would be related to @xmath76 differently , we would have @xmath99 for any @xmath87 .",
    "the chiral transition would disappear .",
    "a similar effect can be seen by changing the sign of the gauge action .",
    "of course we have used the natural sign of the wilson gauge action that is necessary for the continuum limit to emerge from a lattice action .",
    "thus the staggered fermion phases and the natural sign of the wilson action in eq.([eq : plaqact ] ) have conspired together to produce the chiral transition .",
    "finally , it is interesting to know if one could extend such a calculation to the more interesting large @xmath3 phase transitions of douglas and kazakov@xcite , which unlike the transition studied here is a continuum transition .",
    "since the topology of space - time plays an interesting role in this continuum transition , including fermionic variables becomes non - trivial .",
