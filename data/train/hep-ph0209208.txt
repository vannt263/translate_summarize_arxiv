    "one of the most exciting aspect of present high energy physics is the exploration of cp violation in b - meson decays , allowing us to overconstrain both sides and three weak phases @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the unitarity triangle of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite and to check the possibility of new physics .",
    "the `` gold - plated '' mode @xmath12@xcite , which allows us to determine @xmath13 without any hadron uncertainty , recently measured by babar and belle collaborations@xcite : @xmath14 .",
    "there are many other interesting channels with which we may achieve this goal by determining @xmath0 and @xmath1@xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we focus on the @xmath15 and @xmath3 processes , providing promising strategies for determining the weak phases of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , by using the perturbative qcd method .    the perturbative qcd method ( pqcd )",
    "has a predictive power demonstrated sucessfully in exclusive 2 body b - meson decays , specially in charmless b - meson decay processes@xcite . by introducing parton transverse momenta @xmath16 ,",
    "we can generate naturally the sudakov suppression effect due to the resummation of large double logarithms @xmath17 $ ] , which suppress the long - distance contributions in the small @xmath16 region and give a sizable average @xmath18 .",
    "this can resolve the end point singularity problem and allow the applicability of pqcd to exclusive b - meson decays .",
    "we found that almost all of the contributions to the matrix element come from the integration region where @xmath19 and the pertubative treatment can be justified .    in the pqcd approach",
    ", we can predict the contribution of non - factorizable term and annihilation diagram on the same basis as the factorizable one . a folklore for annihilation contributions",
    "is that they are negligible compared to w - emission diagrams due to helicity suppression .",
    "however the operators @xmath20 with helicity structure @xmath21 are not suppressed and give dominant imaginary values , which is the main source of strong phase in the pqcd approach .",
    "therefore we have a large direct cp violation in @xmath22 , since large strong phase comes from the factorized annihilation diagram , which can distinguish pqcd from other models@xcite .",
    "even though isospin analysis of @xmath2 can provide a clean way to determine @xmath0 , it might be difficult in practice because of the small branching ratio of @xmath23 . in reality to determine @xmath0 , we can use the time - dependent rate of @xmath24 including sizable penguin contributions .",
    "the amplitude can be written by using the c - convention : a(b^0^+^- ) & = & v_ub^*v_ud a_u + v_cb^*v_cd a_c + v_tb^*v_td a_t , + & = & v_ub^*v_ud ( a_u - a_t ) + v_cb^*v_cd ( a_c - a_t ) , + & = & -(|t_c|e^i_t e^i_3 + |p_c| e^i_p ) pengun term carries a different weak phase than the dominant tree amplitude , which leads to generalized form of the time - dependent asymmetry : a(t ) & & ( |b^0(t ) ^+^- ) - ( b^0(t ) ^+^- ) ( |b^0(t ) ^+^- ) + ( b^0(t ) ^+^- ) + & = & s _",

    "the time - dependent asymmetry measurement provides two equations for @xmath28 and @xmath29 for three unknown variables @xmath30 and @xmath0 .",
    "when we define @xmath31 , where @xmath32 stands for a branching ratio averaged over @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the explicit expression for @xmath29 and @xmath28 are given by : r _ & = & 1 - 2r_c cos cos(_1 + _ 2 ) + r_c^2 , + r_s _ & = & sin2_2 + 2 r_c sin(_1-_2 ) cos- r_c^2 sin2_1 , + r_c _ & = & 2 r_c sin(_1+_2 ) sin .",
    "if we know @xmath35 and @xmath36 , then @xmath0 can be determined from the experimental data on @xmath28 versus @xmath29 .    since pqcd provides @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the allowed range of @xmath0 at present stage",
    "is determined as @xmath39 as shown in fig .",
    "since we have a relatively large strong phase in pqcd , in contrast to the qcd - factorization ( @xmath40 ) , we predict large direct cp violation effect of @xmath41 which will be tested by more precise experimental measurement in near future . in numerical analysis , since the data by belle collaboration@xcite is located outside allowed physical regions , we considered only the recent babar measurement@xcite with @xmath42 c.l .",
