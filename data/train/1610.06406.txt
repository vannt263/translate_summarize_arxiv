    "<S> such a quasi - one - dimensional waveguide is uniform along the @xmath48-direction , graded along the @xmath43-direction , and is subject to no - stress boundary conditions on its top and bottom ( see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2]b , this band is plotted for several values of the pseudo - magnetic field @xmath42 ; as the pseudo - magnetic field increases , the band flattens over a larger region in wavevector space , which leads to an increasing peak in the density of acoustic states ( shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> this length scale is the acoustic analog of the magnetic length of a landau - level state  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2]d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse location of this mode within the waveguide is controlled by the mode wavenumber @xmath61 , in contrast to an index - graded waveguide in which the location is determined by the mode frequency . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , modes with wavenumbers near the edge of the flat band are located near the waveguide edge , whereas modes near the center of the flat band are located in the waveguide bulk ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> _ sublattice - polarized domain wall modes._ the @xmath57 landau level at @xmath62 has frequency @xmath63 , is located at the waveguide center , and involves displacements exclusively on one sublattice . </S>",
    "<S> modes with these properties generically appear in regions across which @xmath64 changes sign , i.e. , their local dispersions have dirac cones on opposite sides of point @xmath65 . as an example , we consider a waveguide with two domain walls that separate a uniform central region with spring constants set by @xmath50 from two regions , one above and one below , that each have @xmath66 ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> is described by a gapped 1d dirac hamiltonian centered about @xmath63 , with effective mass proportional to @xmath64  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the `` spin '' degree of freedom corresponds to the two sublattices of the honeycomb lattice : eigenstates of @xmath69 with eigenvalues @xmath70 and @xmath71 involve displacements solely on sublattice a and sublattice b , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> when the mass @xmath51 varies spatially , domain walls at which @xmath51 changes sign harbor exponentially localized midgap modes that are `` spin - polarized '' , i.e. , confined to a single sublattice  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sublattice on which the mode is localized is determined by the sign of the change in mass upon crossing the domain wall . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3]a , whose components on sublattice a ( sublattice b ) fall off exponentially from the top ( bottom ) domain wall .    _ towards mechanical lasers._ the sublattice polarization of the landau - level states can also be used to selectively enhance these modes under external drive by employing site - dependent damping . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for positive magnetic fields , the landau - level states live only on the a - sublattice of the honeycomb unit cell  @xcite . if we introduce damping of the form @xmath72 into the equation of motion , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : motion ] ) , such that only the displacements of the b - sublattice are damped , then the landau - level acoustic waves would not be attenuated , whereas the rest of the sound waves , which generically are split between the a and b sublattices , would have a nonzero attenuation  @xcite . to characterize this selective enhancement , we study the attenuation rate @xmath73 as a function of mode wavevector , as well as the self - response function @xmath74 which measures the displacements in response to a drive at frequency @xmath75 ( see  @xcite for computation details ) . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a  b , we plot @xmath74 and @xmath73 for the landau - level bands with @xmath76 , in response to an oscillatory drive that is proportional to the corresponding mode displacement vector . in the absence of pseudo - magnetic field @xmath42 </S>",
    "<S> , no mode stands out as having a strongest response peak in @xmath77  ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a ) , whereas for nonzero @xmath42 , @xmath77 exhibits a strong peak at a frequency @xmath56 , corresponding to the zeroth landau - level  ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]b ) . therefore , when an edge of the metamaterial is driven near @xmath56 , the pseudo - magnetic field combined with selective damping leads to selective enhancement of acoustic landau - level modes ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]c  d ) relative to the rest of the attenuated acoustic spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is the acoustic analog of selective enhancement of microwave modes realized in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . just as selective enhancement for light waves may lead to the design of novel parity - time - symmetric  @xcite and topological  @xcite lasers , analogously , the selective enhancement of sound waves may be useful in the design of sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation ( sasers ) , i.e. , the acoustic analog of lasers , as well as acoustic couplers and rectifiers .    </S>",
