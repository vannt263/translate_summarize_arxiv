    "one of the highest priorities in astroparticle physics has become the understanding of the origin , composition and energy spectrum of ultra high energy cosmic rays .",
    "cosmic rays have been observed for a long time with energies known to exceed @xmath0ev @xcite but the remarkably low flux at these energies makes their detection difficult .",
    "the air showers developing in the atmosphere from the interaction of these particles can be sampled at ground level with arrays of particle detectors . alternatively the fluorescence light emitted by the nitrogen in the atmosphere can be collected by optical systems @xcite .",
    "both types of experiments have confirmed the existence of cosmic rays of such high energies although there are discrepancies between the cosmic ray fluxes inferred by the different techniques @xcite .",
    "the study of extensive air showers of the highest energies is difficult because the atmosphere is part of the detector and the interpretation of measurements is very indirect .",
    "the air shower is a complex chain of interactions resulting in a very large number of particles from which only sparse data samples are taken . from this sample , the properties of the primary particle must be deduced .",
    "we must rely on simplified models , or on complex numerical simulations , to infer these properties .",
    "these simulations have intrinsic and unavoidable uncertainties arising from interaction models that require untested extrapolations of low energy accelerator data .",
    "one of the complications arises because it is often very difficult to discern physical effects due to shower fluctuations or to primary composition from effects due to uncertainties in the interaction models .",
    "it is hoped that through redundancy in the observations , both the high energy models and the primary particle properties can be constrained .",
    "currently , the most important step in this direction is the development of the auger observatory .",
    "the southern part of the observatory is now under construction in argentina and will combine the fluorescence technique with a particle array of water erenkov tanks covering a surface area of 3000  km@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the signal from the tanks is recorded with flash analog to digital converters and relative timing is synchronized using gps technology to 10 - 20  ns .",
    "the time structure of the shower front is of crucial importance because the shower arrival direction in an array of particle detectors is determined from the relative arrival times of the signals .",
    "this is relatively easy since the shower front can be approximated by a plane but clearly there are curvature corrections to the front and the time structure of the signal and its fluctuations will have an impact on the precision of the reconstruction procedure .",
    "understanding the time structure of the signal is most important for controlling the angular resolution .",
    "last but not least , preliminary observations at the auger observatory are already revealing that the time structure of the tank signals carries much information @xcite and it is hoped that this new information can be used to answer fundamental questions such as primary composition .    as most high energy cosmic ray detectors are , or have been , arrays of particle detectors , the time structure of the shower front has been studied before @xcite . however most work is either experimental or phenomenological and there is not a great deal of knowledge about the time structure of signals in air showers from the theoretical side or of its relation to the shower parameters . in this work",
    "we study the time structure of the muon signal in air showers .",
    "our work is based on ideas that have been introduced for the description of muon densities in inclined showers @xcite and is a natural extension of these ideas .",
    "similar ideas have been developed in @xcite .",
    "muons are naturally quite energetic when they reach the ground : otherwise they would have decayed in flight .",
    "as they have long radiation lengths they do not suffer many interactions in their travel path from the point where they are created to ground level . as a result",
    "if muons are present in the signal they define the earlier part of the shower front , i.e. its onset which is usually chosen to define the arrival time to be used in the reconstruction of the direction .",
    "also muons have a much flatter lateral distribution than photons or electrons and they always dominate the signal at ground level for sufficiently large distances from the shower axis . moreover , for inclined showers , they dominate the signal everywhere at ground level because the electromagnetic part of the shower , generated by the decay of neutral pions , is absorbed high in the atmosphere",
    ". therefore , the description of the time structure of muons in air showers is of important practical interest for the reconstruction of air showers from measurements made in extensive air shower arrays .",
    "understanding the muon part of the shower is not the complete story because there are important contributions to the shower signal due to electrons and photons .",
    "we will leave the study of the time structure of electrons and photons for future work . in this article",
    "we neglect the effect of the earth s magnetic field , although it is known that magnetic effects are important for the description of muon densities at high zenith angles .",
    "we have checked that the time structure of muons is not affected by the magnetic field up to zenith angles of 80 degrees and more , depending on the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "although our results are general , and we expect that they will be valid at all zenith angles , we will concentrate on the large zenith angles range , where the muon signal is more important .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the main assumption on which this work is based and we develop an analytical description of muon energy distributions in air showers as a function of transverse distance",
    ". these will be used in the next section when the time structure of the shower front is addressed . in section iii",
    "we describe the two main sources of time delays associated with muons and we present a model for their description , discussing how it compares with the results obtained directly using simulations and the relevance of the magnetic field effects . in section",
    "iv we apply the method to give general results about time distributions in air showers and in section v we summarize and conclude .",
    "our starting point will be an approximate model for the description of the production of muons in air showers .",
    "as the shower develops , muons are in general produced at a range of altitudes with energies spanning a wide range and carrying some transverse momentum .",
    "we will assume that the muon distribution factorizes completely into a product of three independent distributions , the energy @xmath2 , the transverse momentum @xmath3 , and the distance to ground level @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the muon energy and transverse momentum at the production point , and @xmath8 is the distance from this point to ground level measured along the shower axis .",
    "the relation between @xmath8 and production altitude is straightforward but requires taking into account the curvature of the earth for large zenith angle showers . the transverse momentum @xmath9 is defined with respect to the shower axis .",
    "here the three distributions are normalized to 1 and @xmath10 corresponds to the total number of muons produced in the shower .",
    "after production we assume that the muons only undergo continuous energy loss and decay .",
    "this is known to be a reasonable approximation when the magnetic field is ignored .",
    "hard catastrophic interactions , such as bremsstrahlung or pair production , are unlikely because the muon radiation length in air greatly exceeds the whole atmospheric depth even for the most inclined showers .",
    "the angular deviations of the muons reaching ground level due to multiple elastic scattering are negligible because the average muon energy at ground level is about 1  gev for vertical showers and grows rapidly as the zenith angle increases to over 200  gev for horizontal showers @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ model ] we show the geometry of the problem indicating the notation used . for a given distance to the shower axis , @xmath11 ,",
    "the actual distance traveled by the muon , is simply @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is the shower zenith angle and @xmath15 is the polar angle measured in a plane perpendicular to shower axis .",
    "we choose it to be zero for the case in which @xmath16 is a minimum .",
    "this system is natural for the description of the asymmetries of the problem and turns out to be most convenient .     with the polar axis along the shower direction .",
    "coordinates in the transverse plane @xmath11 and @xmath15 are defined in such a way that @xmath17 corresponds to the earliest part of the shower front .",
    "the dotted line represents the distance from first interaction ( star ) to the muon production point ( dot ) .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the path traveled by the muon , @xmath16 , from which the time interval can be deduced .",
    "since muons are observed as they reach ground level , observation at different angles @xmath15 will correspond to different time delays because the path to ground is shortened by @xmath18 ( which is measured along shower axis).,width=10 ]    the distribution of production distance for the muons , @xmath4 , depends on the details of the hadronic model , on the primary energy and on the primary chemical composition .",
    "we can parameterize it from monte carlo simulations . in this article",
    "we will use the results obtained with simulations run with the aires code @xcite for an observation altitude of 1400  m , that of the southern auger observatory , and using the qgsjet model for hadronic interactions @xcite . for zenith angles above @xmath19 a gaussian or a log - gaussian distribution usually reproduces the production profile sufficiently well , but the distributions can be also described numerically if necessary . in fig  [ production - dis ]",

    "ev of @xmath20 and @xmath21 zenith angles as obtained using aires ( histograms ) . also shown is the result of a fit to a log - gaussian distribution ( continuous lines ) .",
    "the observation altitude was set to 1400 m.,width=10 ]    in table  [ table1 ] we show the averages ( @xmath22 ) and widths ( @xmath23 ) of log - gaussian production distance fits performed for a number of showers at different zenith angles .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     equation [ factorization ] assumes that the transverse momentum distribution is independent of both the parent pion energy and its production altitude .",
    "quite generally , this is equivalent to assuming that the transverse momentum distribution is a universal function which depends only on the hadronic interactions . when magnetic effects , muon interactions , and multiple elastic scattering are neglected , the transverse momentum distribution of the muons at production is the combination of that of the parent pion and that introduced through pion decay which is below 30  mev / c and can be then ignored when compared to the typical momenta of hadronic interactions",
    "@xmath26  mev / c .",
    "[ pt - dis ] illustrates the transverse momentum distribution of all the muons that reach ground level .",
    "the most distinctive feature that can be observed is a relatively sharp cutoff for large @xmath9 . particularly for",
    "low zenith angles this is close to an exponential cutoff . a good approximation for @xmath3",
    "is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 mev / c is the characteristic momentum associated with hadronic interactions , and @xmath30 is a normalization constant .",
    "ev and @xmath20 zenith angle as obtained using aires .",
    "only muons that reach an observation altitude of 1400  m are considered .",
    "the distribution of all muons ( top curve ) is compared to that obtained in different radial bins , [ 100,300 ]  m , [ 30,100 ]  m , [ 10,30 ]  m ( from second top to bottom).,width=10 ]    the distribution obtained is actually similar to the transverse momentum distribution in hadronic interactions as could be expected if this was the only source of transverse momentum .",
    "the main corrections to this simplification arise through the cumulative effect of transverse momenta acquired in multiple scattering of parent hadrons before the final hadron ( usually a pion ) decays into a muon .",
    "this cascading effect contributes to enhance the high-@xmath9 tail of the momentum distribution , but fortunately it has little effect on the shape of the bulk of the distribution .",
    "indeed a small dependence of the average transverse momentum with production altitude can be understood , most likely because of this cumulative effect . as the width of the @xmath9 distribution greatly exceeds the magnitude of the shift in transverse momentum due to its correlation with production distance",
    ", one can effectively ignore this dependence which plays a secondary role .",
    "finally the energy distribution of the muons is known to be most affected by muon decay which , depending on the path length traveled by the muons from the production point to ground level , affects muons of different energies @xcite .",
    "one can , as a first approximation , use a fixed energy distribution at production , @xmath2 , which then evolves because of continuous energy loss and decay in flight , to give the distribution at ground level , which is experimentally accessible with an air shower array .",
    "the most important effect is that there is a strong suppression of the distribution for muon ground energies below a low energy cutoff which is controlled by the travel distance for the muons .",
    "clearly this cutoff is heavily dependent on zenith angle because the average distance to production increases rapidly from 1  km to 200  km as the zenith angle changes from vertical to horizontal .",
    "[ factorization ] ignores the transverse position of the parent particles ( mostly pions ) that decay into the muons .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that these particles travel along the shower axis .",
    "a simple argument shows that indeed pions are confined to a relatively narrow cylinder compared to the transverse distances of interest in high energy air shower experiments at ground level .",
    "a pion of energy @xmath31 and transverse momentum @xmath9 , will travel at an angle from the shower axis given by @xmath32 .",
    "the pion will on average travel a distance @xmath33 before decaying , which corresponds to a transverse distance @xmath34 . given that the @xmath9 distribution is suppressed for large @xmath9",
    ", we can see that for @xmath35 over @xmath36 of the pions will have a transverse distance less than @xmath37  m because of decay , which can be neglected compared to the transverse size of an air shower at ground level .",
    "we also see that @xmath38 is independent of the pion energy .",
    "a simple calculation shows that taking into account the transverse distance increase due to multiple cascading implies less than a @xmath39 correction to @xmath38 .",
    "2000 m. ]    eq .",
    "[ factorization ] is made simple by ignoring all correlations between production altitude , energy , and transverse momentum , but it nevertheless has considerable predictive power . the fact that these correlations play a subdominant role in what it is to be described can be understood in terms of the relative importance of distribution widths with respect to correlation effects .",
    "although some correlations are indeed present , we will show that the assumptions made , which ignore them , predict correctly all the major characteristics of the time structure of the muon signal in air showers that we are going to describe .",
    "this can be considered sufficient justification to ignore them .",
    "for the subsequent discussion of arrival time distributions , we will need details about the energy distributions at fixed transverse position , @xmath11 , corresponding to typical experimental situations .",
    "these distributions can be reproduced approximately by considering a simple energy spectrum at production and evolving the distributions accounting for energy loss and decay .",

    "results obtained in such way indicate that @xmath43 has a very weak dependence on zenith angle .",

    "we assume that the muon energy loss is constant @xmath45 where @xmath46 mev @xmath47(g @xmath48 and take for simplicity a constant density atmosphere .",
    "in this case the muon energy can be simply expressed in terms of the path traveled , @xmath16 @xmath49 where @xmath6 is the muon energy at the production point .",
    "in addition the number of muons decreases with @xmath16 due to muon decay . for a muon with initial energy @xmath6 , losing energy in an uniform density atmosphere",
    ", it can be shown that the survival probability is @xcite @xmath50 where the spectral slope @xmath51 for @xmath52 g @xmath53 @xcite .",

    "we can estimate the approximate distance @xmath84 above which this happens , by combining the first and third conditions to obtain @xmath85  m. only for @xmath11 below this scale the spectrum will display two slopes discussed above and a cutoff at higher energies .",
    "it is interesting to notice that @xmath84 is a transverse length scale which is approximately independent of zenith angle .",
    "it can be seen that this scale is also responsible for changes in quantities related to the muon energy in showers , for example the correlation between average muon energy and transverse distance .",
    "the time distribution of the muon signal at ground level is important . to study this",
    "we will consider the delays associated with different mechanisms in muon propagation .",
    "we measure the time delays with respect to a plane front moving in the shower axis direction and traveling at the speed of light . according to the simplifications discussed in section ii",
    ", the muon arrival time will be determined by a combination of two effects .",
    "first there is a simple geometric effect ( geometrical delay ) , muons arriving at distance @xmath11 from the shower axis will take longer , because they travel a larger path than those arriving at @xmath86 .",
    "in addition these muons , being of finite energy , are further delayed with respect to the reference front moving at the speed of light because they travel more slowly ( kinematic delay ) .",
    "we can thus express the total time delay as a sum of these two delays @xmath87 here @xmath88 is the geometrical delay and @xmath89 is the kinematic delay .",
    "the distribution of arrival times taking into account both the geometrical and the kinematic delays can be now obtained by taking a convolution of the distributions associated with the two effects @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the arrival time distributions due to the geometrical and kinematical delays respectively , both normalized to 1 and @xmath93 is a shorthand notation for @xmath94 which is needed for this normalization .",
    "we now study the two delays separately .      for high energy muons we can neglect , in a first approximation , the time delay associated with the finite muon energy .",
    "in that case we would simply convert the path length difference to a corresponding time delay . for a vertical shower",
    "we obtain @xmath95 this relation implies that the delay of muons arriving at a given point on the ground , at a fixed transverse distance @xmath11 , is only a function of the production altitude .",

    "important shower properties such as the shower maximum , which is related to the maximum in the muon production function , can in principle be obtained from it , to the extent that this approximation is valid .",

    "nevertheless fluctuations of the arrival times of muons in an air shower can be related through the work presented here to fluctuations in the distributions discussed here .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that time fluctuations will be mostly due to the fluctuations in the longitudinal development of the shower and in the energy distribution of muons arriving at a given ground area .",
    "we have obtained a procedure that can be used to describe the time structure of the muon signal in extensive air showers .",
    "this procedure is based on two simple mechanisms , time delays due to the extra path length which are discussed as geometrical delays and those due to the sub - luminal velocity of the muons .",

    "the description combines the physical mechanisms with phenomenological descriptions of the energy , transverse momentum and position of the muons that are produced in an air shower with several approximations .",
    "the results obtained agree sufficiently well with those obtained with direct simulations for most distances of interest and for all zenith angles to be of a great importance for practical applications .",
