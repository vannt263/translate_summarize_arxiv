    "we present a measurement of the hadronic photon structure function at a higher value of the average momentum transfer squared , , than has ever previously been reported .",
    "the measurement of  is interesting because of its potential to test perturbative qcd @xcite . in the high-",
    "domain the perturbatively calculable point - like contribution to , which rises logarithmically with , dominates over the non - perturbative hadron - like part .",
    "the structure function  has been measured at  of 706 using a sample of single - tagged two - photon events recorded by the opal detector between 1997 and 1999 .",
    "these events ( also referred to as   events ) can be regarded as deep inelastic scattering of an electron on a quasi - real photon , and the flux of quasi - real photons can be calculated using the equivalent photon approximation @xcite .    to study  the distribution of events in @xmath0 and",
    "is needed .",
    "these variables are related to experimentally measurable quantities by @xmath1 and @xmath2 where  is the energy of the beam electron ,  and  are the energy and polar angle of the deeply inelastically scattered electron , @xmath3 is the invariant mass squared of the hadronic final state and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the four - momentum of the quasi real target photon .",
    "the requirement that the associated electron is not visible in the detector ensures that @xmath6 , so  can be neglected when calculating @xmath0 from equation  [ eqn : xcalc ] .",
    "this analysis uses data from the 1997 to 1999 lep runs , with centre - of - mass energies ranging from 183 to 202 .",
    "the total integrated  luminosity is @xmath7 .",
    "candidate @xmath8 events are required to satisfy the following selection criteria , in addition to several technical cuts to ensure good detector status and track quality .    1 .   a tagged electron is required ; that is , a cluster in the opal electromagnetic endcap calorimeter with an energy of at least @xmath9 and a polar angle @xmath10 in the range 230500  mrad with respect to either beam direction .",
    "the energy of the most energetic electromagnetic cluster in the hemisphere opposite to that which contains the tagged electron must be less than @xmath11 .",
    "3 .   the number of tracks originating from the hadronic final state must be at least 3 .",
    "the visible invariant mass  of the hadronic system is required to be in the range @xmath12 .",
    "the number of objects ( tracks plus unassociated clusters ) , belonging to the hadronic final state must be at least 9 .",
    "the energy deposited in a cone of 200  mrad half - angle about the direction of the tag , excluding the tag itself , must not be more than 2 .",
    "cuts 14 select a sample of candidate single - tag hadronic two - photon events , with double - tag events excluded by cut 2 .",
    "events with leptonic final states are rejected by cuts 3 and 5 .",
    "the invariant mass cuts have two functions .",
    "the lower limit removes the low-@xmath13 region which is dominated by resonance production and is very difficult to model accurately .",
    "the upper limit rejects background events from hadronic decays of  bosons , as does cut 6 .",
    "a total of 348 events pass these cuts , with the data covering the range @xmath14 .",
    "there is a two sigma difference between the number of events selected in the 1997/8 data and that recorded in 1999 , with the 1999 data lying below the monte carlo expectation , particularly at low .",
    "no explanation has been found for this .",
    "the larger samples of  events with the electron tagged in subdetectors at lower polar angles are consistent between the two periods , suggesting that the observed difference could well be purely statistical .",
    "however , as a precaution , the difference is included in the systematic error in this preliminary analysis .",
    "the opal lep1 analysis of  using tags in the same subdetector @xcite found the trigger efficiency to be 100% .",
    "the present analysis uses a tighter set of cuts , thus no inefficiency is to be expected , and a trigger efficiency of 100% is assumed .",
    "monte carlo programs are used to simulate  events and to provide background estimates .",
    "the monte carlo generator used to simulate signal  multiperipheral events is herwig 5.9+(dyn ) @xcite .",
    "the grv lo  @xcite parameterisation of  was used as the input structure function .",
    "the dominant background comes from the reaction @xmath15 .",
    "also significant are non - multiperipheral four - fermion processes with  final states and the qed process .",
    "less severe sources of background are estimated to account for around 1% of the data sample .",
    "figure [ datadists ] shows comparisons between data and monte carlo distributions .",
    "figure  [ datadists](b ) shows the polar angle of the tagged electron .",
    "it can be seen that the monte carlo is somewhat higher than the data in the polar range 260350  mrad . turning to variables describing the hadronic final state",
    ", it can be seen that the number of charged tracks is reasonably well described , figure  [ datadists](c ) , but that the monte carlo lies above the data at low  in figure  [ datadists](d ) - which correlates with high @xmath0 .",
    "the perennial problem in measurements of  is that , because the centre - of - mass system does not coincide with the laboratory system , the hadronic final state , which must be measured to determine @xmath13 , is only partially observed in the detector .",
    "this leads to a dependence of the  measurement on the monte carlo modelling , which is needed for the unfolding process used to relate the visible distributions to the underlying @xmath0 distribution .    in the high-  measurement presented here , however , the situation is not as serious as at lower values of . because of the larger tagging angle",
    ", the hadronic final state has much more transverse momentum and as a consequence is better contained in the detector .",
    "figure [ wrec ] shows the correlation between the measured invariant mass  and the generated @xmath13 as given by herwig 5.9+(dyn ) .",
    "it can be seen that the correlation is maintained throughout .",
    "this is in contrast with the situation observed in the lower  analysis @xcite where the correlation deteriorates at high w. as a consequence of this the result can be expected to have a smaller dependence on the monte carlo modelling of the hadronic final state .",
    "after subtraction of background , the data are unfolded on a linear scale in @xmath0 in the range @xmath16 using the guru program  @xcite .",
    "each data point is corrected for radiative effects and bin - centre corrections are applied . in figure",
    "[ result ] the data are compared to several theoretical calculations .",
    "the leading order parameterisations of  from grv , sas1d @xcite and whit1 @xcite , which all include a contribution from massive charm quarks , are described in detail in reference @xcite .",
    "the naive quark - parton model ( qpm ) simulates only the point - like component of , and is calculated for four active flavours with masses of 0.325  for light quarks and 1.5  for charm quarks .",
    "it can be seen that in this high-  regime the differences between the models are relatively small , particularly in the central @xmath0-region .",
    "the differences between the qpm and the other models are much smaller than at lower , where the photon has been shown to have a significant hadron - like component @xcite .",
    "all the predictions are compatible with the data in three of the @xmath0 bins , but overshoot the data in one bin .",
    "the photon structure function  has been measured using deep inelastic electron - photon scattering events recorded by the opal detector during the years 19971999 .",
    "the  value of 706  represents the highest measured thus far .",
    "has now been measured by opal at  values ranging from 1.9706 .",
