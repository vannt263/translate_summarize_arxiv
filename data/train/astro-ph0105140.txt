    "in magnetic cataclysmic variables ( mcvs ) the accreting material from the secondary star is entrained onto magnetic field lines and accretes onto the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "there it forms a standoff shock , followed by a hot post - shock region of plasma settling onto the white dwarf surface as it cools , principally by bremsstrahlung x - ray radiation , and by optical / ir cyclotron radiation if the magnetic field is sufficiently strong ( see cropper 1990 and warner 1995 for reviews of mcvs ) .",
    "there have been a number of studies of the post - shock accretion flow ( e.g.  aizu 1973 ; langer , chanmugam & shaviv 1981 ; chevalier & imamura 1982 ; kylafis & lamb 1982 ; chanmugam , langer & shaviv 1985 ; imamura etal .",

    "despite the fact that substantial progress has been made , the existing studies generally assume that the velocity and the temperature drop to zero at the base of the accretion column .",
    "the assumption of zero flow velocity and the strict requirement of mass continuity along the field lines immediately implies that the matter density at the base of the accretion column must reach infinity .",
    "recent work by cropper , wu & ramsay ( 2000 ) has highlighted the consequences of an infinite density at the base of the accretion column : the x - rays from the shock - heated region is emitted mostly from its base where the density is rising steeply .",
    "this is true at energies up to approximately that of the shock temperature , which is in the @xmath0  kev range  higher than most imaging or ccd - based x - ray instruments .",
    "the preponderance of emission from the base of the accretion column has made a more in - depth understanding of the physical conditions in shock - heated emission regions essential , not only from the theoretical point of view but also for modelling and extracting information from the observed x - ray spectra .",
    "several aspects have to be considered in order to derive a self - consistent formulation of the accretion flow , especially at the boundary layer where the hydrodynamic flow merges into a hydrostatic white - dwarf atmosphere . in the stationary - state case",
    ", the hydrodynamic variables at the base of the accretion column should match smoothly to the corresponding variables at the white - dwarf atmosphere .",
    "in addition , the energy deposition due to the heat flux emerging from below the white - dwarf atmosphere should be considered . moreover , at some point in the post - shock region , material may become sufficiently cold that a fraction becomes neutral and can not be efficiently confined by the magnetic field . in the time - dependent situation , it is necessary to consider the response of the white - dwarf atmosphere to changes in the local mass - accretion rate and its effects on the stability of the accretion flow .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the stationary - state accretion onto magnetic white dwarfs , with emphasis on the post - shock flow at the boundary layer above the white - dwarf atmosphere .",
    "we consider a modification to the conventional hydrodynamic formulation so that matter diffusion across the field lines is allowed in a thin region at the bottom of the accretion column .",
    "in addition , the heat flux from the white - dwarf atmosphere into the accretion column is considered . as it is an exploratory study , we neglect the complications such as geometrical , gravity and two - fluid effects .",
    "we demonstrate that a closed - form solution as that described in aizu ( 1973 ) and wu etal .",
    "( 1994 ) ( see also chevalier & imamura 1982 ) can be obtained for this formulation .",
    "moreover , the infinities and discontinuities at the base , which lead to unphysical observational consequences , are eliminated .",
    "we calculate the emission from the modified post - shock region and compare their spectral properties with those of the conventional post - shock region .",
    "we assume that the flow of the ionised accreting material follows the magnetic field lines and that the field lines are perpendicular to the white - dwarf surface , so the flow is ( quasi-)one - dimensional .",
    "we neglect gravity effects , which are important when the shock height @xmath1 is not negligible in comparison with the white - dwarf radius @xmath2 ( see cropper etal .",
    "we also assume that only the ionised matter is strictly confined by the magnetic field , while the cold neutral atomic matter can `` leak '' out of the accretion column .",

    "is conserved along each flow line of the ionised material and energy is dissipated only by emitting radiation . in reality the neutral matter may carry away substantial amount of momentum and energy , and hence the strict condition for conservation of momentum and energy along the field lines needs to be relaxed",
    ". this case will be discussed elsewhere ( wu & cropper , in preparation ) .",
    "the accretion shock is assumed to be strong and adiabatic , with the immediate post - shock velocity equal to a quarter of the pre - shock velocity , which is taken to be the free - fall velocity at the white - dwarf surface , i.e.  @xmath16 at @xmath17 .",

    "this limiting case corresponds to `` no leaking '' from the accretion column and a hard , stationary white - dwarf surface with no emergent energy flux from below . if we further set @xmath55 , the aizu ( 1973 ) solution is recovered .",
    "when the accreting material is cooled sufficiently , recombination occurs and neutral atoms are formed .",
    "while the charged ionised matter is magnetically confined , neutral matter can diffuse across the field lines .",
    "as the temperature is lower near the base of the accretion column , we expect matter leakage to be efficient .    in the hydrodynamic formulation that we consider ,",
    "the temperature and the flow velocity are not independent .",
    "the temperature is a monotonic function of the velocity , and in the limit of no leakage it is linearly proportional to the velocity at the base of the accretion column .",
    "the sink ( which depends on the hydrodynamic variables ) can therefore be chosen to be an explicit function of the flow velocity only .",
    "we assume that it is characterised by a critical velocity @xmath56 , below which matter leakage becomes efficient .",

    "we treat @xmath56 as a parameter .",
    "when appropriate atomic and magneto - hydrodynamic processes are considered , an explicit expression of it in terms of the other system parameters can be obtained .",
    "the functional form of @xmath57 above must satisfy the hydrostatic - equilibrium condition at the white - dwarf surface ( @xmath29 ) .",

    "matter leakage therefore occurs only at the very bottom of the accretion column if @xmath56 is sufficiently small , and mass is practically conserved along the flow in most of the post - shock region . for @xmath74 ,",

    "thus if we can indeed rely on small values of @xmath56 , current cold wall models such as those mentioned in section  1 can continue to be employed for x - ray spectral fitting .",
    "the advantage of our treatment is that it avoids the infinities at the base of the flow inherent in all previous formulations in which the stationary - wall boundary condition base is assumed ( e.g.  aizu 1973 ; chevalier & imamura ; wu 1994 ; wu etal .",
    "this is a step in the direction of more realistic formulations which allow the hydrodynamic accretion flow to match the hydrostatic white - dwarf atmosphere .",
    "as noted above the predicted spectral changes are small for small @xmath56 ; however a _",
    "practical _ advantage is that it eliminates the numerical errors resulting from finite sampling of quantities which tend to infinity . in the previous treatments the fineness of the sampling of the base of the post - shock region in the numerical integrating scheme has an effect on the spectral slope : finer sampling",
    "will encounter a higher value of the density ( which is tending to infinity ) at the base , so that softer spectra will be generated . in our formulation , as the singularity at the base is removed , the effect of the sampling is insignificant even when small values of @xmath56 are assumed .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that emission from the boundary layer should be finite , as deduced from equation ( 45 ) .",
