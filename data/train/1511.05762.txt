    "since collective modes go hand in hand with spontaneous symmetry breaking , they are one of the best probes of many - body systems . when a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken , a massless nambu - goldstone ( ng ) mode@xcite should appear in general . in the case of @xmath0 symmetry breaking such as neutral superfluid @xmath1he and superconductors , it takes the form of an excitation of the phase of the order parameter . in superconductors , however , electrons , being charged , are coupled to the electromagnetic field , so that the ng mode is elevated to a high energy due to the anderson - higgs ( ah ) mechanism@xcite , making it difficult to be observed . in the vicinity of the superconducting phase transition , the massless ng mode energy can be low when the superfluid and normal components coexist and cooperatively propagate in the form of carlson - goldman mode@xcite .",
    "in addition to these , fluctuations in the amplitude of the order parameter exist@xcite as well , and their collective excitation is called higgs mode@xcite when the system is coupled to gauge fields .",
    "existence of the higgs mode in a conventional superconductor has been confirmed with raman spectroscopy@xcite , and more recently with terahertz ( thz ) spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "now , if we go over to multi - component superconductors , where the superconducting order parameter consists of multiple complex components , we can expect they should accommodate versatile collective modes . indeed , superfluid @xmath1he is known to have multiple amplitude modes coming from spin - triplet and @xmath2-wave nature of cooper pairs@xcite . for @xmath3-wave superconductors such as high-@xmath4 cuprates ,",
    "it has been group - theoretically shown@xcite that they can accommodate additional amplitude ( higgs ) modes coming from multiple irreducible representations of the @xmath5-dependent gap function with the @xmath6 point - group symmetry . as for the phase modes , multi - gap superconductors",
    "are predicted to have an out - of - phase mode between the two components of the gap function@xcite , called `` leggett mode '' .",
    "mgb@xmath7 is a typical example of multi - gap superconductors@xcite .",
    "its double - gap structure originates from an electronic structure around the fermi energy that comprises @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands@xcite .",
    "observation of the leggett mode in mgb@xmath7 has been reported with tunneling spectroscopy@xcite , raman spectroscopy@xcite and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy@xcite , while no report has so far been made for the higgs mode .",
    "a more recent family of superconductors , the iron pnictides with high @xmath4s , also have multi - orbital and multi - gap structures , where the electron correlation is suggested@xcite to bring about @xmath10 and @xmath11 pairings depending on the chemical composition and/or doping level@xcite .",
    "study of collective modes in such multi - band superconductors should shed a new light on their order parameter and paring interactions .",
    "for instance , it has been predicted that competing @xmath12- and @xmath3-wave interactions can result in different collective modes for different ground states@xcite .",
    "collective modes are also recently studied for systems where superconductivity coexists with diagonal orders such as spin - density wave@xcite or charge - density wave@xcite .",
    "multi - component superconductors thus accommodate a variety of collective modes , but we are still in need of a systematic study for them , where the leggett and higgs modes should be simultaneously examined by varying relative sizes of multiple superconducting gaps .",
    "this has motivated us to specifically pose a question : how are the higgs and leggett modes coupled to electromagnetic fields in multi - gap superconductors ? in the single - band case , the higgs mode couples to gauge fields nonlinearly@xcite , which makes it possible to optically excite the mode , typically with an intense thz wave@xcite . for multi - component superconductors we shall reveal , based on a mean - field analysis , that each collective mode can be resonantly excited through a nonlinear light - matter coupling when the doubled frequency of the driving field coincides with the frequency of each mode , as in the single - band case .",
    "the resonance itself can be interpreted as two - photon absorption by collective modes , which contrasts with raman scattering where the energy difference between the incident and scattered photons is absorbed by elementary excitations including collective modes .",
    "we shall show that each of the two higgs modes and the leggett mode exhibits dramatically different sharpness in the resonance , depending on the interband pairing interaction ( i.e. , interband josephson coupling ) and temperature .",
    "second purpose of the present work is to examine how the light - induced higgs and leggett modes contribute to nonlinear optical responses , especially to the third - harmonic generation ( thg ) .",
    "the resonantly induced thg at the frequency of half the superconducting gap has been observed experimentally for nbn , a single - gap superconductor@xcite .",
    "the thg resonance is contributed from the higgs mode@xcite and density fluctuations , the latter being pointed out to be dominant within the bcs mean - field theory@xcite . in this paper , we shall examine thg arising from the higgs modes and density fluctuations in two - band superconductors .",
    "they are shown to have distinct resonance features , which can be utilized as an experimental probe for multi - band superconductors .",
    "we also point out another thg feature specific to multi - band cases arising from the leggett mode , where we shall discuss the possibility of detecting the leggett mode through thg measurement .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we construct a dynamical theory for two - band superconductivity in the bcs regime . in sec .",
    "iii we calculate the response of the relative phase to an ac electric field to derive the optical resonance of the leggett mode .",

    "let us first derive the equation of motion for optically excited two - band superconductors , in terms of anderson s pseudospins .",
    "we start with the hamiltonian , @xmath13 , \\label{h_2band}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where subscripts @xmath14 and @xmath15 label the two bands , @xmath16 creates an electron with momentum @xmath17 and spin @xmath8 in band @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are respective band dispersions measured from the chemical potential , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are respective intraband pairing interactions , while @xmath23 is the interband pairing interaction .",
    "@xmath24 is the vector potential representing the laser field , which is assumed to be spatially homogeneous , i.e. , the superconductor is assumed to be thinner than the penetration depth and the wavelength of light .",
    "optical interband transitions are neglected here , because we consider the incident light ( such as thz waves ) with energies much lower than the interband transitions .",
    "we further ignore differences in the microscopic charge distribution of wannier orbitals between @xmath14 and @xmath15 bands . in this approximation",
    ", it is known that the leggett mode at zero momentum is not affected by the anderson - higgs ( ah ) mechanism@xcite , since the interband charge transfer concomitant with the leggett mode does not induce an electric current in real space .",
    "hence the leggett mode is not coupled linearly to electromagnetic fields , and survives at low energies . even when the difference in the orbital charge distributions is taken into account",
    ", it will not contribute to the long - wavelength screening ( i.e. , the ah mechanism ) , since the interband current will only occur over typical wave vectors associated with the size of wannier orbitals .",
    "therefore we adopt the hamiltonian ( [ h_2band ] ) in the present paper .",
    "let us then define the mean fields , @xmath25 and @xmath26 which yield a two - band bcs hamiltonian , @xmath27 with @xmath28 for @xmath29 . now it is convenient to introduce anderson s pseudospin@xcite , @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the pauli matrices with respect to the nambu spinors .",
    "the hamiltonian is then concisely expressed , up to a constant , as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a pseudomagnetic field acting on the pseudospins , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively denoting the real and imaginary parts of @xmath36 .",
    "the equation of motion for pseudospins then takes a form of the bloch equation , @xmath37=2\\bm{b}_{\\gamma\\bm{k}}\\times\\bm{\\sigma}_{\\gamma\\bm{k}}$ ] , or , for the mean fields , @xmath38 we have to solve this equation to self - consistently satisfy eq.([gap ] ) , i.e. , @xmath39 when @xmath40 is real .",
    "we shall suppress brackets denoting the expectation values hereafter .    as the initial state",
    "we take the thermal equilibrium state , at which the free energy takes the minimum .",
    "this can be obtained through diagonalization ( bogoliubov transformation ) of the mean - field hamiltonian ( [ ham_sum ] ) with @xmath41 . with @xmath42 ,",
    "the interband coupling term in the free energy reads @xmath43 which is real , because @xmath44 due to the hermiticity of the hamiltonian .",

    "equation ( [ coupling_term ] ) favors @xmath10 pairing ( which is defined as those with sign reversal , @xmath45 ) for @xmath46 , while @xmath11 states ( with @xmath47 ) are favored for @xmath48 . here",
    "the terminology of @xmath10 and @xmath11 are adopted from those in iron pnictide superconductors@xcite . in the following , we set @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the ground state to be real .",

    "is roughly given by the inverse of the halfwidth , one can say that the leggett mode is a long - lived mode only when its energy is below the superconducting gaps .",

    "the leggett mode has an energy @xmath105 between the two superconducting gaps @xmath128 and @xmath151 , and has a broad width as already mentioned .",

    "their energies follow the temperature dependence of the gaps , which can be understood in terms of eq.([h_factor ] ) with @xmath162 .",
    "the higgs mode with higher energy has quite narrow widths for the whole temperature range , which reveals that the higgs mode with the higher energy remains long - lived .",
    "on the other hand , the width of the higgs mode with lower energy is broadened as temperature is increased , and the peak of this mode disappears at a certain temperature .",
    "sharpening of the leggett mode might seem to arise because the mode becomes one of the lowest - energy excitations and thus a stable mode at high temperatures .",
    "however , this can not explain the broadening and disappearance of the lower - energy higgs mode , which is also degenerate with the lowest - energy excitations .",
    "rather , this can be intuitively explained as follows . at low temperatures , cooper pairs",
    "are basically formed through the intraband interactions , giving rise to higgs modes primarily associated with each band ( although modifications due to the interband coupling , such as a broadening of the lower - energy higgs mode , exist ) . at higher temperatures ,",
    "however , cooper pairs with the smaller gap could no longer be formed if it were not for the interband coupling , since the ordinary single - band bcs theory predicts a lower critical temperature for a smaller superconducting gap . through a nonzero interband coupling ,",
    "the larger gap @xmath151 makes the lower @xmath128 finite even at higher temperatures , but cooper pairs are robbed of @xmath14-band character there , and only the higgs mode associated with the larger gap remains .",

    "we can raise an intriguing question of how thg should look like in two - band superconductors .",
    "amplitude of the emitted electric field is proportional to the induced current , so let us calculate the light - induced third - order current .",

    "while @xmath145 has no distinctive spectral features , @xmath143 has peak structures around @xmath185 which represent the two higgs modes , so that the third - harmonic arising from eq.([current_h ] ) is resonantly enhanced at @xmath186 . for strong interband interactions for which the higgs mode with the lower energy is overdamped",

    "thus we have a screened form as @xmath191 equation ( [ current_l ] ) can be reduced to @xmath192 \\label{current_l3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the use of eq.([leggett_solution ] ) . as already shown ,",
    "forced oscillation of the phase difference @xmath193 $ ] resonates with the leggett mode at @xmath194 , so that eq.([current_l3 ] ) and the resulting third - harmonic is enhanced on the same condition .",
    "thus this current represents _ thg from resonantly excited leggett mode_. presence of this phase contribution sharply contrasts with the single - band cases where the phase contribution is fully screened out .    on the other hand , eq.([current_d ] ) for @xmath177 is resonantly enhanced at @xmath195 , because @xmath93 diverges at @xmath196 following @xmath197 [ which can be seen in eq.([simplest_f ] ) ] .",
    "intuitively , this is due to a resonance between @xmath72 and bogoliubov quasi - particles at the superconducting gap edge with diverging density of states .",
    "we have called its origin `` density fluctuations , '' because it has a form of density - density correlation function . in view of eq.([current_d ] ) , @xmath93 can be regarded as the resonance factor for density fluctuations .",
    "all of the higgs , leggett modes and density fluctuations thus contribute to thg . both of the higgs modes and density fluctuations exhibit thg resonance at @xmath198 , which makes it difficult to experimentally distinguish them simply from the resonance frequency ( while the leggett mode resonance at @xmath199 may be distinguishable ) .",
    "however , there is a possibility to distinguish them from the light polarization dependence@xcite , because the higgs modes are isotropic excitations while light - induced density fluctuations are generally not .",
    "in addition , the lower - energy peak of the higgs modes is broadened and weakened in the presence of strong interband interactions , while that of density fluctuations is irrelevant to the interband interaction .",

    ", the leggett mode slightly recovers its stability , while the higgs mode associated with the smaller gap disappears ; the higgs mode with the larger energy always remains long - lived .",

    "such a difference and polarization dependence may help one to experimentally distinguish the contributions from the higgs modes and from density fluctuations .",
    "processes beyond the mean - field approximation , such as fluctuations and dynamical interaction , may affect the mode properties and nonlinear response .",
