    "we have made some progress towards this objective by identifying a quasi - two - dimensional magnet in which @xmath11 is only @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the spin quantum number of the magnetic ion .",

    "our principal result is that long range order similar to that found in the @xmath31 jarosite systems does develop but the spin polarization , @xmath11 , is only 0.4(1 ) times the nel value , @xmath13 .",
    "quantum fluctuations account for the remaining spin of the cr@xmath1 ions .",
    "the bandwidth of the fluctuation spectrum is approximately 6 mev and we place an upper bound of 0.03 mev on any gap in the spectrum .",
    "the neutron scattering measurements were carried out on thermal neutron triple axis spectrometers at the nist reactor .",
    "measurements were taken with fixed incident neutron energies of 13.7mev or 5mev using pg or be as filters in the incident beam . because important conclusions of this paper come from absolute measurements of the neutron scattering cross section , details of how we normalize scattering intensities from a powder sample are given in appendix a.    a 2.8 g powder sample of @xmath32 and a 6 g powder sample of kcr@xmath26(od)@xmath27(so@xmath28)@xmath29 were synthesized using previously published methods@xcite .",

    "unfortunately problems with stoichiometry are not uncommon in this complicated class of materials@xcite .",

    "neighboring octahedra share one oxygen atom which is expected to mediate the strongest exchange interaction in the system between neighboring chromium ions separated by @xmath36    in a kagom plane .",
    "susceptibility measurements on samples a and b showed curie - weiss temperatures , @xmath37 , of -70(5)k and -54(2)k respectively . if nearest neighbor exchange in the kagom lattices indeed dominate , this corresponds to a bond strength @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the average nearest neighbor coordination ( @xmath40 is the number of chromium atoms per unit cell determined from rietveld analysis and listed in table 1 ) . other potentially significant exchange interactions in order of the strengths expected are the interplane coupling ( cr - k - cr , d=6.025(1) ) and the second nearest intraplane interaction ( cr - o - k - o - cr , d=6.268(1) ) .",

    "the two frames show low temperature ( t=0.4k ) data with two different backgrounds subtracted . using diffraction data from immediately above the nel temperature ( t=3.6k ) as a background yields simply resolution limited magnetic bragg diffraction indicating that the low temperature phase has afm order . from comparing the line shapes of magnetic and nuclear bragg peaks",
    "we conclude that the afm correlation length exceeds 500  .",
    "magnetic bragg peaks occur at the same values of @xmath49 as nuclear bragg peaks which implies that the chemical unit cell described above is also a unit cell for the magnetic structure .",
    "this implies that all triangles of spins which are connected by in - plane bravais vectors of the crystal have equivalent spin orientations which we denote by a , b , and c. to determine the actual spin directions and the relative orientation of spins in neighboring kagom planes we compared the measured bragg intensities to those calculated for specific model structures .",

    "[ figspin ] ( a ) . in this structure , spins labeled by a , b , and c were taken to lie within the basal plane and to be rotated 120@xmath50 with respect to one another .",
    "subsequent kagom layers are oriented so that each interplane triangle of chromium ions , such as those shaded in fig .",
    "[ figspin ] , contains all three spin orientations : a , b , and c. this structure provides the best account of the measured intensities out of 72 high symmetry spin configurations which were examined .",

    "note that the error bar quoted here includes the uncertainty associated with other choices of the interlayer registry which also provide a reasonable account of the diffraction data .      since the long range ordered moment is small , sum - rules",
    "imply that we should find static or dynamic short range order which accounts for the remaining spin on cr@xmath1 ions .",

    "[ cstescans ] ( b ) which shows diffraction data similar to those discussed above , though this time using t=50k@xmath54 data for background subtraction . at t=50k",
    "we expect that magnetic scattering is almost @xmath49-independent in the limited @xmath49-range of the experiment .",
    "this is also the case for the thermally activated inelastic phonon scattering which is present in the high temperature data as well@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ cstescans ] ( b ) these terms are over - subtracted but the @xmath49dependence of the difference data should follow that of the low temperature equal time correlation function @xmath55 . for the purpose of comparisons to theory",
    "we determined the base - line for @xmath55 by requiring that the data ( including magnetic bragg peaks ) satisfy the total moment sum rule @xmath56 using @xmath57 as derived from powder diffraction .",
    "the most striking feature of the data is the unusually small fraction of the equal time correlation function which is associated with magnetic bragg peaks .",
    "the result indicates that most of the chromium spin in this material remain spatially disordered down to t=0.4k .",
    "it is important to determine whether the short - range - order is static or dynamic . to settle this question we used the full triple axis configuration of the neutron spectrometer to measure the low temperature ( t=70mk ) spectrum of magnetic fluctuations at two values of @xmath49 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "contributions to the detector count rate not associated with inelastic scattering from the sample were measured and subtracted as described in the figure caption . integrating the data over @xmath58 we obtained the values for @xmath55 shown with solid symbols in fig .",
    "[ cstescans ] ( b ) .",
    "inelastic scattering with 0.4mev@xmath59mev clearly accounts for most of the equal time correlation function and hence we may conclude that the short range order in @xmath0 is mostly dynamic in origin . from the energy spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ conq ] we estimate a magnetic bandwidth of approximately 6mev . in addition we can place an upper limit of 0.4mev on any gap , @xmath60 , in the magnetic excitation spectrum .",
    "a stricter constraint on @xmath60 is derived from the specific heat data of fig .",
    "[ cvandm ] where the absence of activated behavior for @xmath61 k indicates that @xmath62 mev .",
    "further information on magnetic fluctuations is provided by the constant-@xmath58 scans shown in fig .",
    "[ conhw ] .",
    "the data display an asymmetric peak centered close to the strongest afm bragg point , @xmath63 .",
    "the peak progressively broadens as energy transfer is increased .",
    "the sharp leading edge and gradual decrease in intensity with increasing @xmath49 is indicative of low dimensional magnetic correlations@xcite .",
    "based on _ inelastic _ constant-@xmath49 and constant-@xmath58 scans we can also evaluate the a _ lower bound _ on the total fluctuating moment @xmath64 per unit cell .",
    "this number is an appreciable fraction of the total moment sum @xmath65 per unit cell which indicates that the spin system remains predominantly dynamic at low temperatures in this material .",
    "having presented the experimental results we now turn to comparison with relevant theory .",
    "the type of magnetic order in @xmath0 is surprising .",
    "quantum as well as classical theories of the kagom magnet predict that the so - called @xmath66 in - plane structure [ fig .",
    "[ figspin ] ( b ) ] is favored over the `` q=0 '' structure which we observe .",
    "in addition another kagom related material @xmath67 shows short range @xmath66 type order@xcite .",
    "it is therefore surprising to find q=0 type afm order in @xmath0 .",
    "we believe that interplane coupling plays an important role in stabilizing this type of order in jarosite systems . as is apparent from fig .",
    "[ figspin ] ( a ) , q=0 kagom afm layers can be stacked to take advantage of ferro- as well as antiferromagnetic nearest neighbor interlayer coupling , but @xmath66 layers can not .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath68 in - plane translation between neighboring kagom planes is incompatible with the periodicity of the @xmath66 magnetic structure and it is therefore impossible to arrange for all interplane triangles of spins to contain all three spin orientations a , b , and c as required to satisfy interlayer coupling .",
    "indeed , all jarosite kagom systems studied so far have q=0 type in - plane afm order .",
    "interplane coupling also controls another aspect of the three dimensional magnetic structure : the length of the primitive magnetic unit cell in the c direction : three identical but shifted q=0 layers can be stacked to satisfy afm interplane coupling . for ferromagnetic interplane coupling , however , it is favorable to include time reversed copies of each of these three layers in the stack which leads to a six layer sequence and a doubling of the unit cell in the c - direction .",
    "such unit cell doubling is actually observed for @xmath69@xcite .",
    "we have compared our inelastic data to specific models for dynamic correlations in the kagom afm .",
    "several authors have considered spin waves in a long ranged ordered classical kagom magnet and there are a few unusual features to note . as a consequence of a local continuous degree of freedom ( the weather vane mode ) spin wave theories to lowest order in @xmath70 yield a zero energy mode of excitations for all @xmath71 .",
    "furthermore it can be shown that all classical long range ordered ground states lead to the same dispersion relation for the finite energy modes .",
    "we used the results of harris et al.@xcite to calculate the inelastic neutron scattering cross section associated with the finite energy modes of the = 0 structure@xcite .",
    "the calculated cross section was convoluted with the experimental energy resolution function and is shown as dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ conhw ] .",
    "the comparison involves only a single adjustable parameter which is the overall scale factor .",
    "the exchange constant was fixed to 1mev , the value extracted from high temperature susceptibility measurements .",
    "simple lowest order two dimensional spin wave theory clearly can not account well for the data .",
    "specifically the sharp features predicted by the theory are absent in the data .",
    "this is actually quite unusual for two dimensional magnets .",
    "the qualitative features of spin dynamics in @xmath72 are for example very well described by such theories@xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions are also available for the equal time correlation function @xmath55 .",
    "we compare these to our data in fig .",
    "[ cstescans ] .",
    "the dotted line is the result of a monte carlo study  @xcite , and the dashed line resulted from a high - t expansion  @xcite .",
    "given that the experimental data probe _ low temperature _ spin correlations it is surprising that apart from the magnetic bragg peaks the high temperature expansion accounts quite well for the data .",
    "evidently the frustration inherent to the kagom afm prevents much evolution of equal time correlations between high and low temperatures in @xmath0 .",
    "in summary , we have shown that long range afm order exists below a second order transition at t@xmath8=1.8k in the @xmath23/2 jarosite kagom system @xmath0 .",
    "the ordered structure preserves the chemical unit cell and we have argued that this type of structure is favored by interplane coupling . the ordered moment per cr ion in a sample with 76% occupancy on the chromium sublattice is 1.1(3)@xmath4 per occupied chromium site which is only one third of that corresponding to nel order for @xmath23/2 spins .",
    "concomitantly spin fluctuations are unusually strong in this system and can not be accounted for by conventional spin wave theory .",
    "the inset to fig .",
    "[ conq ] summarizes @xmath73 versus @xmath13 for various kagom systems studies so far .",
    "the data indicate that the weakly diluted @xmath23/2 kagom afm may be close to a t=0 quantum critical point separating a phase with @xmath74 from a phase with @xmath75 @xcite .",
