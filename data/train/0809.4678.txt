    "the study of these geometries contributes both to the implementation of physical ideas in these spaces and to the exploration in concrete examples of the basic concepts in non - commutative geometry .    in the realm of quantum field theory",
    ", the widely employed dimensional regularization technique@xcite provides a hint that such non - integer dimensional spaces could be of relevance in physics .",
    "this study intends to go a step further in realizing those spaces as concrete geometrical objects . in the field",
    "theoretic setting a desirable outcome in the direction of the ideas mentioned above would be , for example , to obtain an implementation of dimensional regularization at a lagrangian level , or , in a more general setting , to really consider the possibility that physical space is non - integer dimensional .",
    "the general picture of non - commutative geometry shows that there are many ways to construct spaces with non integer dimensions . in this work",
    "we look for , so to say , the simplest and easiest to treat examples of such spaces . a first step in this direction is to realize that it is possible to get non - integer dimensional geometries even when the underlying @xmath0-algebra of the spectral triple is commutative .",
    "the examples presented below are of this kind .",
    "the generalization of the concept of dimension in non - commutative geometry is provided by the connes - moscovici definition of dimension spectrum@xcite .",
    "section 2 presents an example with complex dimension spectrum but trivial differential algebra .",
    "it can be considered as a simple example focused on getting a non - trivial dimension spectrum .",
    "section 3 presents a deformation of the canonical spectral triple whose dimension spectrum includes real non - integer values .",
    "the main results for this last example obtained in this work are related to junk forms and distance .",
    "as mentioned in the abstract , no junk forms appear for non - vanishing values of the deformation parameter @xmath2 .",
    "this fact leads to a differential algebra which involves forms of arbitrary degree and is neither anti - commutative nor commutative .",
    "this situation may be compared with the canonical case where junk forms play a crucial role in getting the usual differential algebra .",
    "this important qualitative difference between the integer dimensional case and the deformed one is , in a certain vague sense , analog to the absence of poles in dimensionally regularized feynman integrals .",
    "regarding distance , this turns out to be a function of the coordinates and @xmath2 .",
    "this function involves a @xmath3(@xmath4 ) which does not come , as in dimensional regularization , from an analytical continuation of the factorial appearing in the solid angle integral .",
    "in fact , there is no solid angle involved since we start from a support space for the commutative @xmath0-algebra in the spectral triple which is one dimensional .",
    "here we deal with the triple @xmath5 where ,      @xmath6 is the @xmath7-algebra generated by @xmath8 with the following multiplication rules,@xmath9 where the star structure is given by,@xmath10 this algebra is isomorphic to the one of polynomials in a complex variable @xmath11 and its complex conjugate @xmath12 the norm for this algebra will be given below in terms of a representation in a hilbert space @xmath13 .",

    "thus the representative of any element in the algebra is bounded . defining the norm for the algebra in terms of the operator norm in this representation leads to a pre-@xmath0-algebra structure in @xmath6 .",
    "next this pre-@xmath0-algebra structure is completed to a @xmath29-algebra structure in @xmath6 .",

    "* @xmath72 implies that @xmath64 is selfadjoint . *",
    "@xmath73 implies that @xmath64 has compact resolvent .",
    "the property ( [ 18 ] ) holds for the choice ( [ gs5 ] ) . according to definition [ cm ]",
    "the discrete dimension spectrum is the union of the poles in @xmath80 for any @xmath39 .",
    "each of such poles can be considered to describe the dimension of a certain piece of the whole space .",
    "if we take elements @xmath81 in the image of @xmath82 , i.e. @xmath83 , the following zeta function is obtained , @xmath84 for the choice ( [ gs5 ] ) the last equation leads to,@xmath85\\;\\;\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\;|k+1/2|^{-\\varepsilon z}\\nonumber \\\\ \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\delta_{n,0}[1+\\:\\cos(\\pi\\varepsilon))](2^{\\varepsilon z}-1)\\zeta_{r}(\\varepsilon z)\\label{ds15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 denotes the riemann zeta function .",

    "first we consider the equation , @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the vector @xmath111 in a vector space @xmath112 , @xmath113 is the canonical scalar product in that space and the equation should be solved for the vector @xmath114 , i.e. we look for all vectors orthogonal to @xmath110",
