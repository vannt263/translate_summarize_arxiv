    "dna amplification refers to a class of methods that can achieve geometric growth of the number of double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) molecules through repeated polymerization on single - stranded dna ( ssdna ) templates .",
    "such methods have arguably become the central technology of experimental molecular biology and biochemistry , due to the fact that dna amplification is required almost universally in applications ranging from molecular cloning to dna sequencing .",
    "the most common dna amplification reaction is the polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) , a cyclic amplification process that can produce millions of copies of dsdna molecules starting from a single molecule , by repeating three steps  (",
    "i ) dsdna denaturation , ( ii ) oligonucleotide primer annealing to the resulting ssdnas , and ( iii ) polymerase - mediated extension steps to produce two dsdna molecules  resulting in geometric growth of the number of dna molecules .",
    "in addition to its importance as the primary method for preparing copies of dsdna , dna amplification is a model system for the study of fundamental properties of the dynamics and control of sequence replication @xcite .",
    "dna amplification is concerned with the promotion of replication of a given sequence by time - dependent manipulation of the external environment . in this regard",
    "it is important to distinguish the theory of nucleic acid amplification dynamics from that of darwinian evolution .",
    "darwinian evolutionary theory is concerned with the problem of sequence evolution or optimization through replication in the presence of a static or specified time - varying external environment .",
    "this encompasses strategies such as laboratory directed evolution , which apply external selection pressure to a population of sequences in order to promote the optimization of fitness through sequence evolution @xcite .",
    "darwinian evolution assumes the ability of a system to both self - replicate and mutate .",
    "it is generally acknowledged that during the early stages of prebiotic evolution , protocells consisting of compartmentalized nucleic acids were not capable of self - replication under time - invariant environmental conditions . as such , they required time - varying environmental inputs to improve replication efficiency @xcite prior to the onset of darwinian evolution .",
    "for example , time - varying temperature profiles capable of driving nucleic acid replication may have occurred on the early earth due to diurnal cycles of heating and cooling or temperature gradients generated by geothermal activity @xcite .",
    "mutations occurring during these cycles of environmentally controlled replication may then have led to functional nucleic acids that ultimately developed the ability to self - replicate @xcite . thus , unlike the darwinian paradigm of selective replication of the fittest sequences in an uncontrolled environment , control of dna amplification may involve selection of time - varying inputs that promote the survival and replication of otherwise less fit sequences .",
    "hence the theory of dna amplification dynamics is distinct from the theory of evolutionary dynamics @xcite  although they are closely related since both are concerned with the dynamics of sequence replication .    in dna amplification by the polymerase chain reaction",
    ", the time - varying environmental input is achieved through thermal cycling of the reaction mixture . in order to compute the optimal temperature cycling protocol for the reaction - which is sequence - specific - a dynamic model for dna amplification capable of predicting the evolution of reaction products for general sequences and operating conditions",
    "is required .",
    "however , in the absence of such a dynamic model , the operating conditions for pcr reactions are typically selected based on analysis of reaction thermodynamics , and , to a lesser extent , qualitative analysis of reaction kinetics .",
    "reductions in cycle efficiency ( either through decreased reaction yield or specificity compared to the theoretical maximum values ) therefore commonly occur - and due to geometric growth , this can result in dramatically diminished efficiency of the overall reaction .",
    "this has led to considerable interest in the development of methods for improvement of dna amplification efficiency @xcite .    a general approach to dynamic optimization of dna amplification",
    "could be used to systematically design new types of amplification reactions @xcite corresponding to specified sequence amplification objectives , as well as to enhance existing reactions .",
    "a simple example of a temperature cycling protocol that involves modifications to the conventional prescription is the use of two - step pcr cycles , wherein annealing and extension occur simultaneously at a properly chosen temperature .",
    "another important example of modified temperature cycling is the method of co - amplification at reduced denaturation temperature ( cold - pcr ) @xcite , which enriches the amplification of low copy number mutant sequences that are associated with early cancer prognosis , in the presence of a vastly more concentrated wild - type dna background .",
    "this approach introduces intermediate steps in each pcr cycle to achieve mutant enrichment .",
    "still another example arises in the problem of multiplex pcr , where annealing temperatures must be chosen such that several primers can simultaneously anneal , while avoiding the formation of mismatched hybrids . over the past two decades",
    ", many other variants of dna amplification have been invented based on the notions of dna denaturation , annealing and polymerization , each tailored to a particular amplification objective .",
    "each such reaction ( which is typically assigned its own acronym ) is based on a temperature cycling protocol determined through analysis of reaction thermodynamics and kinetics .",
    "formulation of dna amplification problems as optimal control problems should provide a general framework for the discovery of new classes of such reactions .",
    "this paper is concerned with the establishment of a foundation for the optimal control of dna amplification reactions , which can be used for the automated computation ( rather than qualitative selection ) of temperature cycling protocols .",
    "control theory provides a convenient means of parameterizing the interaction of a reaction network for molecular sequence replication with an external environment . to our knowledge , a theory of optimal environmental control of molecular sequence replication has not been proposed .",
    "we formulate this theory for the model system of dna amplification via the polymerase chain reaction .    for dynamic optimization of dna amplification , a sequence - dependent state space model is required .",
    "a sequence - dependent state space model is a system of differential equations that , when solved , describe the dynamics of the evolution of particular biopolymer sequences , along with algebraic constraints and specified parameters ( e.g. , rate parameters such as activation energies and pre exponential factors ) whose values are either predicted based on first - principles theory , independently measured in offline experiments , or indirectly estimated through online measurement of observable quantities ( such as total dna concentration ) .    in this paper , we use first - principles sequence - dependent kinetic models recently introduced in @xcite and @xcite to formulate amplification of dna as a problem in control theory with optimal solutions that can differ considerably from strategies typically used in practice .",
    "first , the notion of sequence - dependent control systems of biochemical reaction networks is introduced .",
    "control systems corresponding to several dna amplification models are then formulated and compared .",
    "next , we formulate optimal control problems based on the sequence - dependent kinetic model for dna amplification and specified objectives . besides sequence dependence ,",
    "another novel feature of control of dna amplification is the cyclic nature of optimal temperature control strategies , which are usually assumed to be periodic .",
    "we show that the optimal control strategy for dna amplification will change depending on the stage of the reaction , due to changes in the availability of resources required for replication , and demonstrate how the control problem can be formulated to enable prediction of aperiodic manipulated input functions .",
    "finally , strategies for the optimal synthesis are proposed for each stage of amplification .",
    "in @xcite , a sequence and temperature dependent state space model for dna amplification was developed by the authors , and model parameters were estimated using experimental datasets . in this section",
    "we summarize and further develop this model , which is used in the present work to study the control of dna amplification .",

    "the latter generalized dynamic optimization problem is applicable to primer design for optimally controlled dna amplification .",
    "it is also of interest in the context of the chemical evolution of the earliest nucleic acid amplification reactions @xcite .",
    "recent studies have considered how in the early stages of prebiotic evolution , replication of nucleic acids in minimal protocellular compartments may have occurred nonenzymatically @xcite , followed by the evolution of ribozyme polymerases ( replicases ) within these compartments that were capable of self - replication @xcite . both stages of chemical evolution likely required time - varying environmental inputs in order to promote strand separation and polymerization in an alternating fashion .",
    "indeed , studies have shown that protocell membranes may have been capable of withstanding temperatures of up to nearly 100 @xmath94c @xcite , and that pcr amplification within supramolecular vesicles can induce vesicles to divide , thus suggesting that the amplification of nucleic acids through temperature cycling can be coupled to the replication of protocells @xcite .",
    "efforts are underway to explore the extent to which an optimal temperature profile for control of nucleic acid amplification , derived using the methods described herein , can accelerate the evolution of increased replication efficiency of nucleic acids through mutations .",
