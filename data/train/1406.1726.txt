    "<S> [ fig3](a ) reveals band gap reopening . despite of the overlap with the conspicuous tail of the intraband transition , </S>",
    "<S> the interband absorption edge in region ii shows a clear change of slope : it becomes steeper as the pressure is increased to 5.1 gpa , possibly due to the band gap reopening . for a more conclusive observation of the band gap reopening , we cooled the sample to 70 k in order to reduce the electronic scattering rate @xmath36 , so that the intraband transition peak became narrower and overlapped less with the interband absorption edge . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) , the absorption edge systematically tilts towards higher photon energy from 2.4 to 4.2 gpa , suggesting that the band gap monotonically increases . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a structural phase transition occurs at 4.5 gpa ( at 70 k ) , causing a dramatic overall decrease of absorbance . </S>",
    "<S> pressure - induced band gap closing and reopening were also observed in pbte at low temperature @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the above discussion illustrates the complexity of analyzing the interband absorption edge to identify gap closure and band inversion at a tpt . </S>",
    "<S> considering the apparent monotonic increase of spectral weight in region iii [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) ] as a function of pressure , one might conclude that a tpt had not occurred . </S>",
    "<S> but the key signature of gap closure is obscured by overlap with the intraband absorption , as well as by thermal broadening . </S>",
    "<S> this can be circumvented by cooling the material , revealing both the redshift and then blueshift of the absorption edge as the band gap closes and then reopens . </S>",
    "<S> the situation for bitei is even more complicated due to the rashba splitting and the additional optical transitions among the split subbands @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cooling does not alleviate this complication . </S>",
    "<S> thus , inferring how the band gap changes in that and similar materials from measurements to sense the absorption edge is not practical .    in the rest of this letter , we present two more signatures of pressure - induced tpts in pbse , namely a steeper absorption edge in the topological phase and a maximum in the pressure dependence of the fermi level .    the absorption edge becomes steeper after the tpt , distinguishing the topological phase from the trivial phase . </S>",
    "<S> such behavior is clearly observed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) and confirmed by the calculated optical conductivity shown in fig .  [ fig3](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results emphasize the hybridization nature of the band gap in a ti ( or tci ) as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](d ) , qualitatively different from that in a trivial insulator . as demonstrated by the evolution of the band structure across a tpt close to the direct band gap , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a  b ) , before the tpt , pressure suppresses the band gap and transforms the band dispersion from a near - parabolic shape to almost linear . after the tpt , </S>",
    "<S> the band dispersion briefly recovers the near - parabolic shape and then flattens . </S>",
    "<S> [ at even higher pressure , it develops a mexican - hat feature @xcite similar to that illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](d ) . ] </S>",
    "<S> the flat band makes the joint density of states just above the band gap much greater than that of an ordinary insulator with the same band gap size , yielding a steeper absorption edge . </S>",
    "<S> it also gives rise to van hove singularities that differ from the typical ones @xcite , shown as peaks in the optical conductivity for @xmath50 and 1.00 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](c ) .    such a peak feature </S>",
    "<S> was previously observed ( although unexplained ) in the bi@xmath51te@xmath51se ti material with low free carrier density @xcite , but is absent in our infrared absorbance data shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a  b ) , possibly for two reasons . first </S>",
    "<S> , the peak only appears deep in the topological phase , which requires a high pressure that in reality causes a structural phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> second , the burstein - moss effect ( see the next paragraph ) in our sample precludes optical transitions connecting the states near the top valence band and the bottom conduction band and thus the observation of van hove singularities . the dashed line in fig .  [ fig3](c ) </S>",
    "<S> demonstrates that holes with a density of 10@xmath11  @xmath12 completely smears the sharp peak .    </S>",
    "<S> lastly , our calculation shows a maximum in the pressure - dependence of the fermi level @xmath27 at the gap - closing pressure [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c ) ] , which can be measured from shubnikov - de haas oscillations @xcite to support the tpt . </S>",
    "<S> this maximum in @xmath27 happens because the density of states near the top valence band diminishes as the band dispersion becomes linear @xcite , pushing the fermi level away from the top valence band to conserve the phase space for the holes . </S>",
    "<S> this effect also manifests in the infrared spectra , although @xmath24 can not be easily determined from them . </S>",
    "<S> when free carriers are present , the band gap associated with the absorption edge is not the true band gap in the electronic band structure . as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) , the holes shift the fermi level to below the top valence band , making the energy threshold for direct interband transitions approximately @xmath28 , known as the burstein - moss effect . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption edge characterizes @xmath28 instead of @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the combined pressure effects on @xmath26 and @xmath24 retain a minimum in @xmath28 , but the corresponding pressure could be different from the critical pressure for band gap closing , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the absorption edge never redshifts to zero photon energy even when @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the burstein - moss effect adds further difficulty to the identification of tpts using the absorption edge .    to summarize , </S>",
    "<S> we have established bulk signatures of pressure - induced band inversion and thus topological phase transitions in pb@xmath0sn@xmath1se ( @xmath2 , 0.15 , and 0.23 ) . </S>",
    "<S> infrared reflectance shows a maximum in the bulk free carrier spectral weight near the gap - closing pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the interband absorption edge tracks the change of the band gap across the topological phase transition , however the free carriers complicate the picture due to the overlap with the intraband transition and the shift of the fermi level . the absorption edge becomes steeper in the topological phase due to the hybridization nature of the band gap in topological insulators . </S>",
    "<S> a maximum in the pressure dependence of the fermi level is also expected . </S>",
