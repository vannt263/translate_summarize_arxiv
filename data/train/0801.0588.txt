    "it is commonly accepted that , at rhic , we have produced the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in laboratory ; the question is if this new state of matter is already present in the sps energy range as has been considered likely in the cern press release of february 2000 ?",
    "we present here a brief discussion of our findings as described in full length elsewhere  @xcite . here",
    ", we look at the abundant production of strange flavored hadrons in the relativistic heavy ion collisions at top ags and all sps energies , addressing the na49 energy scan results @xcite .    our data analysis employs the statistical hadronization model ( shm ) ; we assume that the strong interactions saturate the quantum particle production matrix elements .",
    "therefore , the yield of particles is controlled dominantly by the magnitude of the accessible phase space .",
    "the shm contains little if any information about the nature of interactions , and thus , it embodies the objective of reaching simplicity in many body dynamics , allowing to identify the properties of the dense and hot primary matter formed in heavy ion collisions .",
    "interpretation of experimental data is arrived at with the share suite of programs @xcite .",
    "the total final state hadron multiplicity is a measure of the entropy @xmath1 produced . in the qgp ,",
    "the entropy production occurs predominantly early on in the collision , once a quasi - thermal exponential energy distribution of partons has been formed , the entropy production has been mostly completed , even if the chemical yield equilibrium is not achieved yet . since the kinetic processes leading to strangeness production are slower than the parton equilibration process , we are rather certain that the production of entropy occurs mainly prior to strangeness production .",
    "even though the degree of chemical equilibration of gluons in early stages ( which dominate strangeness production ) are uncertain , study of kinetic strangeness production show that the controlling quantity is the entropy contents .",
    "for this reason , the observable ` strangeness pairs per entropy ' @xmath2 ( also colloquially referred to as @xmath3 ) emerges as diagnostic tool , also since in essence both @xmath4 and @xmath1 are conserved in the process of hadronization .",
    "the phase space density is in general different in any two matter phases .",
    "thus when transformation of one phase ` q ' ( for qgp ) into the other occurs rapidly , given chemical equilibrium in the decaying phase , in general the final state is out - of chemical equilibrium .",
    "especially , when hadrons are produced in a recombinant model , in order to preserve entropy , there must be a jump in the phase space occupancy parameters @xmath5 .",
    "the superscript @xmath6 indicates that we refer to the qgp phase ; variables in the hadron phase will be stated without an superscript .",
    "this jump replaces the increase in volume found in a slow transformation involving re - equilibration . in order to preserve entropy in sudden hadronization of supercooled qgp at @xmath7 mev , we must have for the light quark ` q ' occupancy @xmath8 .",
    "the value @xmath9 is where the pion gas condenses .",
    "the required value of @xmath10 is decreasing with increasing temperature and is crossing @xmath11 near @xmath12 mev .",
    "thus , in fast hadronization of the qgp phase ( without an increase in volume , i.e. , mixed phase ) , we expect that , the value of @xmath10 governing hadron yields must be greater than unity for every value of @xmath13 considered in previous studies of the hadronization process , with the relation being approximately as @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "the ratio @xmath3 up to a structural numerical factor compares the degeneracy of strangeness to the overall qgp effective degeneracy . at sufficiently high temperature , the entropy density @xmath15 in qgp",
    "is that of ( nearly ) ideal quark - gluon gas : @xmath16 for an equilibrated qgp phase with perturbative properties : = 0.23 [ 0.5 x^2k_2(x ) ] . for early times ,",
    "when @xmath17 is relatively small , assuming the equilibrium value ( @xmath18 ) , we can find @xmath19 .",
    "however , at high temperature strangeness is not yet equilibrated chemically and in general the value in qgp at hadronization is expected in the range @xmath20 .",
    "when and if strangeness is not equilibrated in the qgp source , we in effect can determine the value @xmath21 by comparing to the above expectations .        in order to arrive at the above estimate",
    ", we needed to use the number of degrees of freedom in chemically equilibrated qgp , which is shown by dashed lines in .",
    "solid lines allow for the effect of approach to chemical equilibrium of strangeness , assuming : @xmath22 .",
    "most of temperature dependent corrections cancel , and one finds in the latter case that it is possible to use a nearly @xmath13 independent value seen for for @xmath23 mev in , @xmath24 near to qgp breakup condition , which value is decreasing to @xmath25 for a hot qgp  @xcite .    to quantify the strangeness enhancement signature due to deconfinement we compare in the value of @xmath3 in chemically equilibrated hadron matter with that of chemically equilibrated qgp ,",
    "see , as function of chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath13 .",
    "this figure quantifies the specific strangeness enhancement of the qgp phase .",
    "this enhancement implies in fast hadronization that a chemical nonequilibrium must arise among ( strange ) hadrons formed .",
    "the high density of strangeness present at qgp hadronization can therefore lead to a considerable enhancement of the yields of multi - strange antibaryons , and @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "strangeness enhancement is best expressed by the magnitude of @xmath27 after hadronization , which we evaluate conserving strangeness and entropy . at hadronization , beginning with a qgp phase which is nearly chemically equilibrated at the point of hadronization : s / s = f(_s,_q , t)(_s/_q)^5/6(0.0260.01 ) , t(140,180 ) mev .     for the chemically equilibrated qgp ( green , solid line for @xmath28 mev , blue dash - dot line for @xmath29 mev ) ; and for chemically equilibrated hg ( red , dashed).,width=340,height=302 ]    only when one considers the entropy content as measured by hadron yields ,",
    "the understanding of the strangeness production in qgp is reliable .",
    "if instead the production of strangeness is studied at some presumed ` hydro'-inspired space - time profile of temperature @xmath13 , results are meaningful only if the qgp entropy @xmath1 content has been directly related to an observed hadron multiplicity .",
    "namely , if the initial temperature is modeled to be 20% below value needed for the observed entropy , the initial entropy content is cut in half . in the qgp",
    "this means that there are half as many gluons , and the rate of strangeness production by gluon fusion is cut down by a factor 4 , which in turn implies that strangeness would not equilibrate in qgp .",
    "we analyze the particle production obtained in the energy scan of the na49 experiment at cern - sps  @xcite , and also include the results of our earlier analysis of the top ags data  @xcite .",
    "the outcome of the fit procedure is stated in the top section of table [ agsps ] .",
    "the @xmath30 values , marked with an asterix @xmath31 in table [ agsps ] , are result of a strangeness conservation constraint , which , however , is not chosen to be zero , but as shown in table : since strangeness conservation constraint involves several particle yields it is inappropriate to insist on @xmath32 , since this correlates the errors of the input data which are experimentally not correlated .",
    "our procedure was to fit first without strangeness conservation , and once we see the strangeness asymmetry to fix it at the best value shown in table so that the resulting procedure of fixing @xmath30 is the same as used by other groups , but that there is no unnecessary error constraint introduced among strange hadrons .",
    ".for each projectile energy @xmath33 [ @xmath0gev ] for ags and sps energy range , we present in the header @xmath34 , the invariant center of momentum energy per nucleon pair , @xmath35 the center of momentum rapidity .",
    "this is followed by statistical parameters @xmath36 obtained in the fit , the strangeness asymmetry required , and we present the resulting chemical potentials @xmath37 , the reaction volume @xmath38 and the centrality of the reaction considered .",
    "this is followed first by input and than by output total hadron multiplicity @xmath39 .",
    "+ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "at the top sps energy , the value of @xmath40 implies for a qgp source a @xmath41 , which corresponds to @xmath42 .",
    "this , in fact , is the reason why chemical equilibrium @xmath43 ` marginally works ' for this data set .",
    "however , as function of energy we see a very spectacular preference for non - equilibrium , of two different types . for two lowest reaction energies considered",
    ", we are below chemical equilibrium and for other , higher energies , with @xmath44 gev we see over saturation of chemical occupancies .",
    "since we fit data very well , we also describe precisely the k@xmath45 ratio as we show in .",
    "the maximum of the ratio k@xmath45 occurs for @xmath46 gev where we find @xmath47 .",
    "an anomaly associated with the horn is the large yield of @xmath48 , and protons , see bottom section of table [ agsps ] .",
    "we further note that the structure of the horn shown by dashed ( semiequilibrium ) and dotted ( equilibrium ) lines is also reproduced qualitatively , contrary to reports made by other groups .",
    "we have traced this behavior to our relaxation of the strangeness conservation condition .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=340 ] -0.2 cm    do the low energy results imply absence of quark matter , and thus reactions between individual hadrons ?",
    "our analysis shows that the chemical freeze - out occurs in a highly dilute phase .",
    "however , the rapid rise of strangeness yield as function of reaction energy , suggests that the strangeness production processes differ from those encountered in normal hadron matter . for this reason we favor a constituent quark matter reaction picture at 11.6 and 20 @xmath0 gev , with color deconfinement arising yet below this energy range .",
    "the relatively high temperature and low @xmath10 are consistent with properties of constituent quark phase with @xmath51 mev and @xmath52 mev , gluons are ` frozen ' .",
