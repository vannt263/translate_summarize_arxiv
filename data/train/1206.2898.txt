    "networks are ubiquitous in almost every aspect of the human endeavor , explaining the recent burst of work in this area @xcite . besides the topology of the different kinds of networks , the dynamical processes that take place on them is of utmost importance . in particular",
    ", random walks are the natural framework to study diffusion , transport , navigation , and search processes in networks , with applications in a variety of systems , such as the propagation of epidemics and traffic flow @xcite , animal @xcite and human mobility @xcite , and the dynamics on social networks @xcite .",
    "the problem of random walks on networks has been addressed before , using a strategy of navigation that considered the motion to nearest neighbors @xcite . here",
    "we introduce a generalization of this navigation rule by considering that the transition probability is not restricted to nearest neighbors , allowing transitions that follow a power law as a function of the distance ( integer number of steps ) between nodes .",
    "this generalized navigation rule was inspired by the study of lvy flights where the random displacements @xmath0 obey asymptotically a power - law probability distribution of the form @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "+ random walks on networks are related to the problem of searching since one strategy of search is precisely to navigate the network , starting from a source node , using a random walk until finding a target node @xcite .",
    "the problem of searching and foraging has received considerable attention recently @xcite . in particular , it has been shown that , under some general circumstances , lvy flights provide a better strategy to search or navigate , compared with a strategy based on brownian motion @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the problem of foraging by animals @xcite , lvy strategies are rather common , as well as in the problem of human mobility and behavior @xcite . in a similar fashion , we are proposing that our lvy random walk navigation strategy ( lrw ) can be more efficient than the normal random walk strategy ( nrw ) to cover the network .",
    "+ this generalized navigation strategy can consider some common situations encountered in real networks .",
    "for instance , in social networks one can take advantage of the full or partial knowledge of the network beyond our first acquaintances .",
    "currently , using social network sites , one can identify the friends of your acquaintances ( second - nearest neighbors ) or the friends of the friends of your acquaintances ( third - nearest neighbors ) and so on , to search for a job , an expert opinion , etc . in this way , one can contact a second- or third - nearest neighbor of a friend directly , without the intervention of the friend .",
    "this situation corresponds to a long - range navigation on a network : a social network in this case .",
    "+ thus , in this paper we are connecting two important fields : lvy navigation strategies and dynamics on complex networks .",
    "we study the dynamics on an undirected network by means of a master equation that we solve exactly without any approximation .",
    "we obtain exact expressions for the stationary distribution , the random walk centrality @xcite , the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) @xcite , and the average time to reach any node on the network .",
    "we use a formalism in terms of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the transition probability matrix associated with the process .",
    "we consider an undirected connected network with @xmath2 nodes @xmath3 , described by an adjacency matrix @xmath4 with elements @xmath5 if there is a link between @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 otherwise .",
    "we consider the case where @xmath9 to avoid loops on the network .",
    "the degree of the node @xmath6 is given by @xmath10 .",
    "another matrix associated with the network is the distance matrix @xmath11 , with elements @xmath12 that denote the integer number of steps of the shortest path connecting node @xmath6 to node @xmath7 . for undirected networks",
    "@xmath11 is a symmetric @xmath13 matrix .",
    "the average distance @xmath14 scales as a power of @xmath2 for large - world networks , whereas @xmath14 scales as @xmath15 for small - world networks @xcite .",
    "+ we start with the discrete time master equation that describes a random walker on a network @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the occupation probability to find the random walker in @xmath7 at time @xmath18 starting from @xmath6 at @xmath19 .",
    "the quantity @xmath20 is the transition probability to move from @xmath6 to @xmath7 in the network . in the case",
    "where @xmath21 , it is given by @xmath22 where @xmath12 are the elements of the distance matrix @xmath11 and @xmath23 .",
    "this transition probability represents a dynamical process where the random walker can visit not only nearest neighbors but nodes farther away in the network .",
    "however , the farther away they are , the less probable the event of hopping to that node is .",
    "the power - law decay of this probability is controlled by an exponent @xmath24 , which is a parameter in our model and varies in the interval @xmath25 .",
    "+ there are two important limiting cases : in eq .",
    "( [ wij ] ) , when @xmath26 we obtain @xmath27 , which corresponds to the normal random walk on networks , previously studied by other authors @xcite , describing transitions only to nearest neighbors with equal probability , that is , inversely proportional to the degree of the node . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath28 , the dynamics allows the possibility of hopping with equal probability to any node on the network ; in this limit , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 denotes the kronecker delta . for @xmath31 ,",
    "the random walker could hop not only to nearest neighbors but to second- , third- and @xmath32-nearest neighbors with a transition probability that decays as a power law .",
    "+ it is worth noticing that there are navigation strategies where some links are added to a @xmath33-dimensional lattice with a probability proportional to @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a metric distance , generating in this way a small - world network @xcite",
    ". however , in our case , the network is not modified , and the possibility of long - range steps is determined dynamically by @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ wij ] ) .",
    "+ let us now solve this problem , starting with the stationary distribution . by iteration of eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) , @xmath17 takes the form @xmath37 defining the quantity @xmath38 , from eq .",
    "( [ wij ] ) , we obtain @xmath39 . using this relation in eq .",
    "( [ factors ] ) , the detailed balance condition is obtained : @xmath40 in order to obtain the stationary distribution , we need to take the limit of the occupation probability when the time tends to infinity . in this limiting case , the information of the initial condition is lost , and the stationary distribution gives the asymptotic probability to be in a particular node .",
    "thus , for the stationary distribution @xmath41 , , @xmath42 ; if @xmath43 the markovian process is cyclic and @xmath44 is interpreted as a temporal average of @xmath17 when @xmath45 . ]",
    "( [ dbalance ] ) implies @xmath46 ; therefore @xmath47 thus , we have obtained in eq .",
    "( [ pinf ] ) the exact expression of the stationary distribution @xmath48 , which is proportional to the quantity @xmath49 given by the sum of the inverse of the distances , weighted by @xmath24 , to node @xmath6 .",
    "equation ( [ pinf ] ) generalizes previous results , and it is valid for any undirected network .",
    "again , we have two limiting cases : when @xmath26 , eq .",
    "( [ pinf ] ) gives @xmath50 , which is precisely the result obtained for normal random walks @xcite ; for @xmath28 , we obtain the expected result @xmath51 . + the quantity @xmath49",
    "can also be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the number of @xmath54-nearest neighbors of node @xmath6 .",
    "this equation gives a more clear interpretation of the quantity @xmath55 : for node @xmath6 , it is the sum of the first - nearest neighbors plus the second - nearest neighbors divided by @xmath56 and so forth .",
    "we refer to this quantity as the _ long - range degree_.    we study now the random walk centrality and the mfpt .",
    "the occupation probability @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) can be expressed as @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the first - passage probability starting in node @xmath6 and finding node @xmath7 for the first time after @xmath18 steps . using the discrete laplace transform @xmath59 in eq .",

    "( [ tij ] ) there are three different terms : the mean first return time @xmath66 , the quantity @xmath67 which is independent of the initial node , and @xmath68 . the time @xmath69 is interpreted as the average time needed to reach node @xmath6 from a randomly chosen initial node of the network .",
    "the quantity @xmath70 is the random walk centrality introduced in @xcite and gives the average speed to reach the node @xmath6 performing a random walk . in our case",
    ", this quantity corresponds to a generalization of the random walk centrality based on the long - range degree given in eq .",
    "( [ dsum ] ) .",
    "+ using eq .",
    "( [ tij ] ) , we obtain @xmath71 where the time @xmath72 is the average of the mfpt over the stationary distribution @xmath73 and , as shown here , is a constant independent of @xmath6 . in the context of markovian",

    "we need to find @xmath17 .",
    "we start with the matrical form of the master equation @xmath75 .",
    "the transition probability matrix @xmath76 is a stochastic matrix with elements @xmath77 , and @xmath78 is the probability vector at time @xmath18 . using dirac s notation , @xmath79 where @xmath80 represents the canonical base of @xmath81 . due to the existence of the detailed balance condition",
    ", the matrix @xmath76 can be diagonalized , and its spectrum has real eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "we find a solution of ( [ master ] ) in terms of the right eigenvectors of the stochastic matrix @xmath76 that satisfy @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "the set of eigenvalues is ordered in the form @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "using the right eigenvectors , we define the matrix @xmath86 with elements @xmath87 .",
    "the matrix @xmath86 is invertible , and a new set of vectors @xmath88 is obtained by means of @xmath89 .",
    "thus @xmath90 using the diagonal matrix @xmath91 , we obtain @xmath92 .",

    "( [ tij ] ) , the mfpt @xmath99 is @xmath100 finally , using ( [ tconst ] ) and ( [ rijspect ] ) , we obtain @xmath101 therefore , we have obtained exact expressions for the occupation probability @xmath17 , the stationary distribution @xmath102 , the time @xmath69 , the mfpt @xmath99 , and the time @xmath72 in terms of the spectrum and the left and right eigenvectors of @xmath76 . notice that the time @xmath72 is a constant that can be calculated using only the spectrum of eigenvalues of @xmath76 .",
    "( color online ) @xmath69 vs @xmath103 for a scale - free network with @xmath104 nodes , using three values of the exponent @xmath24 .",

    "this global time @xmath107 gives the average number of steps needed to reach any node on the network independently of the initial condition .",
    "in the particular , yet important , case of regular networks ( such as lattices and complete graphs ) where the stationary probability is a constant given by @xmath108 , we obtain that both global times @xmath72 and @xmath107 are the same , @xmath109 .",

    "in what follows we use the exact results obtained by our matrix formalism , given in eqs .",
    "( [ eigenpt])-([tconstspect ] ) , to calculate the corresponding quantities .",
    "it is important to stress that the results in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] and [ fig : fig2 ] are not numerical but exact calculations using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath76 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] we show the quantity @xmath69 , which represents the average time needed to reach node @xmath6 from any node in the network .",
    "we use in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] a scale - free network of the barabsi - albert ( ba ) type , in which each node has a degree that follows asymptotically a power - law distribution @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "we show three cases with different values for the exponent @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ wij ] ) , that correspond to three different navigation rules .",
    "the cases @xmath115 correspond to a lrw , and the limiting case @xmath26 corresponds to a nrw @xcite . in the inset",
    "we show the stationary distribution @xmath44 for different values of degree @xmath103 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] we can conclude that ( 1 ) according to the inset , using lrw , it is more probable to reach the nodes with a small degree ( which are the majority of nodes on the network ) , compared with nrw , and ( 2 ) for nodes with a degree lower than a critical degree , which is the vast majority , lrw can diminish the time to cover most of the network , compared with nrw .",
    "on the other hand , the time to reach those nodes with a high degree is lower using nrw than lrw since lrw covers more uniformly the entire network , despite the degree of the nodes .",
    "therefore , if the purpose is to cover the vast majority of the network , it is better to use a lrw strategy , but if the goal is to reach the few highly connected nodes , it is better to use a nrw .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we show @xmath107 vs @xmath24 for five different kinds of networks using our exact results . in regular networks [ one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattices ] @xmath107",
    "is calculated using eq .",
    "( [ tconstspect ] ) , and for the other three networks @xmath107 is obtained by averaging the quantities given by ( [ tauispect ] ) .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] shows that for large - world networks , such as lattices and trees ( networks without loops @xcite ) , the lrw strategy navigates the network more efficiently .",
    "that is , for smaller values of @xmath24 the average number of steps tends to the value @xmath116 , whereas for larger values of @xmath24 ( corresponding to nrw ) the number of steps can be one or two orders of magnitude larger . in the bottom panel",
    "we notice that even for small - world networks , such as scale - free ( sf ) and erds - rnyi ( er ) @xcite networks , the number of steps is larger for nrw than for lrw .",
    "thus , the lrw strategy reduces the global time @xmath107 compared with the nrw strategy , transforming dynamically a large - world network into a small world .",
    "it is worth noticing that the walker can in principle visit any node of the network in a single step , but with a decreasing probability depending on the exponent @xmath24 .",
    "the dynamics involve small , intermediate and large steps , drawn from a probability distribution , given by eq .",
    "( [ wij ] ) , that decays as a power law .",
    "thus , the dynamics is more complex than in a complete graph , where every node is connected to every other node ; however , as discussed before , in the limiting case when @xmath24 tends to zero , the transition probability tends to a constant value given by @xmath117 , where @xmath2 is the number of nodes on the network . in this limiting case , we arrive at a situation similar to a complete graph where each node on the network is connected to every other node .",
    "we show in fig . [",
    "fig : fig2 ] , that the case @xmath118 is optimum in the sense that the average global time is minimum ; however , even for values of @xmath119 , the difference between the lrw strategy and the dynamics for @xmath118 is negligible .",
    "this implies that the overall effect of navigating using lvy random walks can be as effective as navigating on a complete graph .",
    "( color online ) monte carlo simulation of the number of distinct visited sites @xmath120 vs time in a network with @xmath104 .",
    "( a ) a 1d lattice , ( b ) a random tree , and ( c ) a scale - free network . each curve is obtained from the average of @xmath121 realizations of the random walker.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    these results are confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] where we show now monte carlo simulations for the percentage of different visited sites @xmath120 in the network , as a function of time , for different values of the exponent @xmath24 .",
    "small values ( @xmath122 ) correspond to lrw and large values ( @xmath123 ) to nrw . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a ) , we depict the results for a 1d lattice , showing that the number of visited nodes for nrw grows diffusively , whereas for lrw grows ballistically . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](b ) , we show the results for trees and we see that once again the lrw explores the network faster than the nrw . finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](c ) we show that even for scale - free networks there is some advantage in exploring the network using the lrw strategy than the nrw strategy .",
    "even though the difference is smaller , we notice that we can cover the network faster using lrw than using nrw .",
    "in summary , we have introduced a new strategy of navigation in general undirected networks , including complex networks , inspired by lvy random walks , that generalized previous navigation rules .",
    "we obtained exact expressions , using a matrix formalism , for the stationary probability distribution , the occupation probability distribution , the mean first passage time and the average time to reach a node in any undirected finite network .",
    "we found that using the lvy random walk navigation strategy we cover more efficiently the network in comparison with the normal random walk strategy . for small - world networks we obtained that the average time to reach any node on the network is smaller than the time",
    "required using the normal random walk strategy . for large - world networks ,",
    "this difference can be one or two orders of magnitude .",
    "additionally , we found that for large - world networks , like trees or lattices , the lvy navigation strategy can induce dynamically the small - world effect , thus transforming a large - world network into a small world .",
    "finally , our exact results provide a general formalism that connects two important fields : lvy navigation strategies and dynamics on complex networks .",
