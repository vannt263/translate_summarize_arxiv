    "the profile of the critical current versus film thickness is predicted to reflect a crossover from two - dimensional to three - dimensional ( 3d ) collective pinning of the vortex lines@xcite .",

    "the hexatic bose glass is therefore robust to the addition of weak point pins .",
    "in particular , the longitudinal larkin scale @xmath77 remains divergent for @xmath78 , which is equivalent to the inequality @xmath79 .",
    "the critical current density of the above hexatic bose glass , which is robust to the addition of point pins , can be obtained by applying 2d collective pinning theory@xcite .",
    "all vortex lines can be considered to be rigid rods .",
    "balancing the lorentz force against the collective pinning force over a larkin domain@xcite@xcite yields the identity @xmath80^{1/2}$ ] for the product of the critical current density along the film , @xmath81 , with the perpendicular magnetic field , @xmath82 , aligned parallel to the material line defects@xcite . here",

    "plastic creep _ of the vortex lattice due to slip of the quenched - in lines of edge dislocations along their respective glide planes@xcite .",
    "minimization of the sum of the elastic and pinning energy densities then yields a higher density of larkin domains in the hexatic bose glass with material point defects added by comparison ( [ ratio ] ) : @xmath85 .",
    "this reflects the injection of extra lines of edge dislocations that relieve shear stress caused by point pins .",
    "substitution in turn yields a critical current density , @xmath86 , that has a component due to correlated pins set by the identity @xmath87 and that has a component due to point pins set by the ratio @xmath88 .",
    "the critical current density notably varies as @xmath89 with magnetic field in the limit of weak pinning@xcite .",
    "consider now a film geometry of thickness @xmath90 along the axis of the material line defects .",
    "the forces due to point pins add up statistically along a rigid interstitial vortex line . the effective pinning force per unit length experienced by an interstitial vortex line",

    "they are consistent with a _ broken _ bose glass state for the vortex lattice , which is threaded by isolated lines of edge dislocations of length @xmath77 along the @xmath3-axis that are connected together by lines of screw - dislocations@xcite along the transverse directions@xcite . as in the limiting case of the true bose glass state ( fig .",

    "the critical current per unit width then varies with film thickness as @xmath114 , showing no offset .",
