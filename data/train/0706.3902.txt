    "( [ o1 ] ) and ( [ nuevita ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath120 and eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) as @xmath121    note that eq .",
    "( [ vvd ] ) does not saturate for mixed state preparation , so it is possible to find a stricter inequality .",
    "in fact , this is what has been accomplished in eq .",
    "( [ 3v ] ) . yet eq . ( [ vvxi ] )",
    "does not saturate for mixed - state preparation @xcite , so stricter inequalities could eventually still be found .",
    "in order to illustrate the formalism , we particularize it in this section to a concrete example : the symmetric quanton - detecton system ( sqds ) @xcite . the sqds is represented in fig .",
    "[ figojo ] .",
    "the system is basically a quantum logic gate in which each qubit ( quanton and detecton ) plays the role of which - way marker of the other .",
    "the conditional dynamics is achieved at the common phase shifter .",
    "the detecton phase shifter depends on the @xmath122 alternative ways of the quanton in the form @xmath123 where @xmath124 is an entangling phase and @xmath125 is the usual z component of the pauli matrices for the detecton .",

    "the detecton , like the quanton itself , is a two - way interferometer , likewise describable by a predictability @xmath126 and a fringe visibility @xmath127 satisfying @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the bloch vector describing the initial state of the detecton .",
    "we take the quanton prepared initially in a pure state so @xmath130    the  quality \" of the wwm is given in this model simply by @xmath131 @xmath132 characterizes `` how good '' the wwm is to establish quantum correlations leading to the acquisition of wwi about the quanton .",
    "thus , the dependence of eq .",
    "( [ qd ] ) on the entangling phase can be understood .",
    "the dependence on @xmath133 is also important . as discussed in @xcite , as the detecton acquires wwi about the quanton it also degrades its own fringe visibility .",

    "both qubits acquire wwi about each other and both degrade their visibility .",
