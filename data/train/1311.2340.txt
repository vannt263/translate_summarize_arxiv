    "the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) is a dwarf irregular galaxy connected by a hydrogen gas and stellar bridge to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "both are nearby satellites of our milky way galaxy and because of this proximity they are ideal environments within which to study stellar populations and to calibrate many different stellar standard candles .",
    "the smc is more metal - poor than the lmc , and this provides an important opportunity to check on the metallicity dependencies of the different standard candles used in distance scale work .",
    "this makes the smc very important in establishing a precise distance scale despite its complicated geometrical structure and larger extension in the line - of - sight compared to the lmc . for these reasons ,",
    "the smc has played an important role in our araucaria project @xcite whose main goal is to produce a significantly improved calibration of the extragalactic distance scale .    for almost a decade",
    "we have been observing late - type eclipsing binary systems in both magellanic clouds , systems which have a particularly strong potential to derive precise distances these galaxies @xcite .",
    "recent observations have proven this potential : analysis of eight binaries in the lmc has led to a distance to the lmc accurate to 2.2% , more accurate than any other previous determination of this fundamental parameter @xcite . here",
    "we extend this work to a measurement of the distance to the smc using the same method , leading in addition to a better knowledge of the geometrical structure of this galaxy . from our studies of late - type detached eclipsing binary systems in the smc and lmc we also expect to improve on the determination of the astrophysical parameters of red giant stars and cepheid variables @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using detached late type systems over those containing early type stars comes from utilizing well determined empirical surface brightness relation ( e.g.  the barnes - evans relation in the optical ) derived for late type stars from interferometric measurements ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the main points are well summarized by @xcite : `` the distances are derived without assumptions about luminosity class or effective temperature , and are ultimately based only on geometrical factors .",
    "that means that the only source for systematic error should be from the barnes - evans calibration and this is the place where we expect the most significant improvement will occur .",
    "another wirtue is that for stars later than a0 the barnes - evans distance is essentially independent of reddening . ''",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe photometric and spectroscopic observations , section 3 gives details of our method , section 4 contains a description of model solutions for individual binaries . in section 5 we present a distance determination to the smc and section 6 is devoted to a discussion of our results .",
    "basic data on our four eclipsing binary systems are given in table  [ tbl:1 ] .",
    "their position within the body of the smc is presented in fig .",

    "our targets were discovered by @xcite and confirmed to be eclipsing binaries by @xcite .",
    "optical photometry in the johnson - cousins filters was obtained with the warsaw 1.3 m telescope at las campanas observatory in the course of the second , third and fourth phase of the ogle project @xcite .",
    "we secured 5314 i - band measurements ( over 1000 per system ) and 391 v - band measurements ( over 70 per system ) for five eclipsing binaries .",
    "because of the long orbital periods consecutive epochs were taken usually on different nights .",
    "the time span of the i - band observations is 5684 days .",
    "the raw data were reduced with the image - subtraction technique @xcite and instrumental magnitudes were calibrated onto the standard system using landolt standards .    near - infrared photometry",
    "was collected with the eso ntt telescope on la silla , equipped with the sofi camera ( pi : pietrzyski ) .",
    "the setup of the instrument , reduction and calibration of the data onto the ukirt system were essentially the same as described in @xcite .",
    "we collected at least 10 epochs of infrared photometry for every our target outside eclipses .",
    "the transformation of our photometry onto the johnson system was done using the equations given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the whole multiband photometry is presented in table [ tbl : phot ] .",
    "high resolution echelle spectra were collected with the clay 6.5 m telescope at las campanas , equipped with the mike spectrograph and with the 3.6 m telescope in la silla , equipped with the harps spectrograph .",
    "we used a @xmath3 arcsec slit with mike giving a resolution of about 40000 . in the case of harps we used the eggs mode giving a resolution of about r@xmath480000",
    "the typical s / n at @xmath45300   was about 20 and 6 for the mike - red part and harps spectra , respectively , and about 12 at @xmath44700   for the mike - blue part spectra .    in order to determine radial velocities of the system s components we employed the broadening function ( bf ) formalism introduced by @xcite .",
    "radial velocities were derived using the ravespan software @xcite using numerous metallic lines in the wavelength regions 4125 - 4230 , 4245 - 4320 , 4350 - 4840 , 4880 - 5000 , 5350 - 5850 , 5920 - 6250 , 6300 - 6390 , 6600 - 6800  . as templates we used synthetic spectra with [ fe / h]=@xmath5 from a library computed by @xcite .",
    "the templates were chosen to match the atmospheric properties of the stars in a grid of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the resulting velocities are presented in table [ tbl : spec ] .",

    "they are : mike - red@xmath8mike - blue@xmath9 m s@xmath10 and mike - blue@xmath8harps@xmath11 m s@xmath10 .",
    "we concluded that there is no significant systematic shift in radial velocities from spectra taken by harps and mike spectrographs . in the analysis we included separately radial velocities from both the blue and red sides of mike , effectively including the mike velocities at twice the weight of the harps velocities .",
    "the reason is that the mike spectra usually have significantly better s / n compared to the harps spectra .",

    "we did not break the adjustable parameters set into subsets , but instead we adjusted all free parameters at each iteration .    for each system we used information obtained from spectroscopy to derive the relative intensity of absorption lines of both components from the mike spectra .",
    "we treat these as approximate light ratios in the blue and red part of the optical spectra .",
    "these light ratios are reported in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "we do not use them to fix light ratios in our models , however , but use them to rule out alias solutions and to verify if the light curve solution is consistent with the spectroscopy .      to constrain the important input parameters of the eclipsing binary components we decided to disentangle the spectra of the individual components and carry out an abundance analysis .",
    "the most important parameter is the effective temperature of each component which scales the luminosity ratio of the components and the limb darkening coefficients .",
    "also , by calculating the intrinsic ( @xmath25 ) colors from the derived temperatures , we can estimate the reddening of each system .",
    "we used the prescription given by gonzales & levato ( 2005 ) to disentangle individual spectra of the binary components .",
    "the method works in the real wavelength domain .",
    "it requires rather high signal to noise ratio spectra to work properly and thus we were restricted to using only the red mike spectra .",
    "the red mike spectra were shifted and stacked using the radial velocities found by using the broadening function as described in the previous section .",
    "no initial secondary spectrum was used in the disentangling .",
    "the range of wavelength used was from 4960   to 6800   where numerous fei and feii lines are present .",
    "we emphasise that we do not use the disentangled spectra to derive new radial velocities because they always give higher dispersion than synthetic templates .",
    "the reason is that the relatively low s / n ratio of our disentangled spectra reduces the accuracy of radial velocity measurements .",
    "the disentangled spectra have to be renormalized in order to account for the companion s continuum which dilutes the depth of the absorption lines .",
    "if the light ratio of the secondary to the primary component at a given wavelength is @xmath45 then we subtract a value @xmath46 from the disentangled spectrum of the primary ( corresponding to the secondary flux ) and we again normalize the final spectrum . in the case of the secondary spectrum we subtract @xmath47 . here",
    "two things must be emphasized : 1 ) the choice of a proper normalization level before disentangling and 2 ) the choice of a proper model of a system to calculate an appropriate light ratio function @xmath48 . regarding the first point , all spectra have to be normalized and for high s / n spectra the level of normalization is simply the mode value . in the case of lower",
    "s / n spectra like those obtained for our binaries in the smc , the level of normalization is a bit ambiguous and usually we set it to a value of @xmath490 percentile .    regarding the second point , we must be aware that there is a large number of possible model solutions to the observed light and radial velocity curves . a model which is the best",
    "i.e. it minimizes the residua of synthetic fits does not always predict light ratios in agreement with spectroscopic light ratios .",
    "this is because our data have limited s / n ratio and because an optical depth were absorption lines are formed is usually different from an optical depth at which we observe stellar photosphere .",
    "if we use an `` improper '' model for a system to predict the spectroscopic light ratios , the resulting absorption line depths in the disentangled spectra are invalid . an easy way to notice an inappropriate model is to check if the absorption line bottoms in the renormalized spectrum of the primary or the secondary are below zero , which is a level signifying an unphysical model .",
    "another check is based on a comparison of equivalent widths of the same absorption lines in both components .",
    "usually the hotter component should have lines with smaller equaivalent widths .",
    "however such a comparison is not unique because components of the same binary may have different abundances @xcite .",
    "finally , we can calculate the equivalent width ratios for the components for the same lines and determine that this ratio is not wavelength dependent .",
    "we expect that for realistic models , this ratio is approximately constant within the spectral range of disentangling .",

    "was obtained with a third light contribution included .",
    "if we assume that the presence of the third light is real and is not connected with some imperfections in the absolute calibration of the ogle photometric data then this suggests the presence of a red companion or a blended star with an almost negligible contribution to the optical portion of spectrum .",
    "indeed we could not detect any additional source of absorption lines in our spectra .",
    "for the purpose of the determination of the distance we assumed that the third light contribution in the k - band is at least equivalent to that in the i - band .",
    "the uncertainty in the amount of third light in the k - band is the largest source of statistical error of the absolute stellar radii and the distance determination to the system .",
    "this eclipsing binary has the identifier sc4 192903 in ogle - ii database .",
    "it was previously analyzed by @xcite who used only the photometric data from the second phase of the ogle project @xcite without any spectroscopic observations .",
    "a comparison of the photometric parameters presented in our table  [ tbl-3 ] and in table  2 from @xcite shows very similar model solutions with the only difference resulting from our inclusion of a contribution from third light .",
    "this results in different measured orbital inclinations .",
    "although the stellar mass estimate in @xcite seems to be too low ( see tab .  3 in that paper ) , the stellar radii , temperatures and luminosities show good agreement .",
    "the system contains the most luminous and massive late type giants in the magellanic clouds analyzed by our team .",
    "the system was analyzed before by @xcite using data from ogle - ii .",
    "as in the case of smc101.8 14077 , our photometric solution is almost identical with that reported by @xcite , but a difference appears in the absolute dimensions which are significantly underestimated in the previous study .",
    "the results of our preliminary work on this system , reported by @xcite , are not significantly different from those reported in this paper , and based on more extensive observational data we refine the previous distance estimate to this binary .",
    "an interesting feature of this system is the difference of the center - of - mass radial velocities between the components .",
    "the hotter primary has systematically blueshifted radial velocities with respect to the secondary star amounting to 0.78 km s@xmath10 - see fig .  3 in @xcite .",
    "we accounted for this effect by subtracting the difference and solving the radial velocities equating the systemic velocity of the secondary with the barycenter velocity of the system .",
    "some possible reasons for the difference are discussed in @xcite for capella , a physically similar but lower mass binary system .",
    "another irregularity is a discrepancy between the temperature ratio @xmath92 as obtained from the analysis of the atmospheric parameters ( see section  [ atmo ] and table  [ tbl-4 ] ) compared to that arising from the light curve analysis ( table  [ tbl-3 ] ) .",
    "the light curve solution and the spectroscopic light ratios suggest a temperature difference of about @xmath264  k , while the atmospheric analysis suggests a difference of @xmath265  k. we repeated the atmospheric analysis by fixing the gravities of both stars to reliable values obtained from the dynamical solution reported in table  [ tbl-6 ] .",
    "however , we obtained the same small difference of the effective temperatures .",
    "we also performed additional analysis by forcing the same metallicity for both components .",
    "however , the difference in effective temperatures do not vary again .",
    "probably the problem with this system is the low s / n of the spectrum of the secondary star . while the primary has a nice spectrum and by consequence the parameters",
    "are well established , for the secondary both @xmath266 and @xmath23 are uncertain , and by consequence the metallicity .",
    "it is worth noting that the mean temperature of the system @xmath267  k obtained from the atmospheric analysis is the same as the mean temperature calculated from color calibrations ( i.e. 5315  k ) to within the errors .",
    "this system contains two stars with very similar masses and surface temperatures but with quite different radii .",
    "it is the only eccentric system in our sample .",
    "the system is very well - detached with no proximity effects visible in the light curve , not surprising given its long orbital period .",
    "the best solution is found for a logarithmic law of limb darkening , a marginal improvement to that found using a linear law of limb darkening .",
    "an analysis of the broadening of the absorption lines provides an estimate of the ratio of the projected rotational velocities , @xmath268 .",
    "this value is consistent with the ratio of the radii and signifies similar periods of rotation for the components ( tidal locking of both stars ) , in spite of their relatively large separation .",
    "this is only system in our sample with total eclipses .",
    "this allows us to determine the stellar radii with a precision of better than 1% for both components .",
    "this eclipsing binary shows quite large proximity effects because of the relatively large secondary component .",
    "an interesting feature is the reversed luminosity ratio of the components : the less massive secondary seems to be more evolved and much brighter than the hotter primary component .",
    "taking into account the relative proximity of the stars , we can not exclude that there has been an episode of mass transfer in the system when the present secondary star filled its roche - lobe as it evolved along the red giant branch .",
    "the present system is detached , and such past mass exchange does not influence our distance determination .",

    "@xcite used observations of classical cepheids to unambiguously show that the magellanic clouds have different distance moduli , corresponding to a distance difference of about 11 kpc . this difference is small enough that in practice almost all methods of distance determination can be employed simultaneously to both objects .",
    "in fact the relative distance between the galaxies obtained from the application of a particular method is usually better constrained than the individual distances determined by that method .",

    "the north - east part of the smc was shown to be closer to us and have a substantial degree of complexity , and it is reported also to have the largest geometrical depth in line - of - sight @xcite . the apparent difference in the distance to the eclipsing binary smc113.3 compared to the rest of our sample may confirm the existence of substructure in the front of the galaxy .",
    "we can interpret that the remaining eclipsing binaries are part of the main body of the galaxy .",
    "the small dispersion in the distance moduli of our four binaries ( 0.05 mag , corresponding to @xmath303 kpc ) may signify a small geometrical depth of the main part of the smc .",
    "we can investigate this more by an analysis of the distribution of differences in the distance moduli ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "the cumulative distribution has a dispersion of 0.068 mag . because most of the systematic effects do not influence @xmath304 , and",
    "the geometrical depth of the central part of the lmc is small @xcite , we can interpret this spread as an imprint of the geometrical depth of the main part of the smc . at a distance of 62 kpc this dispersion corresponds to a 1-@xmath305 line - of - sight depth of 4 kpc .",
    "@xcite gave a review of recent line - of - sight depth estimates for the smc which we can use for a comparison .",
    "they concluded that the 1-@xmath305 line - of - sight depth is between 4 and 5 kpc for the old population of stars ( rr lyr and red clump stars ) .",
    "for the cepheids the estimated depth is larger by up to @xmath306 kpc , and in the case of intermediate - age clusters the depth reaches @xmath307 kpc .",
    "@xcite compiled some recent distance determinations to the smc as reported up to 2011 .",
    "their conclusion was that the canonical value of the distance modulus to the smc ( @xmath308 mag , @xcite ) remained marginally consistent with most recent determinations ( see also section  [ relativ ] ) .",

    "<S> we present a distance determination to the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) based on an analysis of four detached , long period , late type eclipsing binaries discovered by the ogle survey . </S>",
    "<S> the components of the binaries show negligible intrinsic variability . </S>",
    "<S> a consistent set of stellar parameters was derived with low statistical and systematic uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute dimensions of the stars are calculated with a precision of better than 3% .    </S>",
    "<S> the surface brightness - infrared color relation was used to derive the distance to each binary . </S>",
    "<S> the four systems clump around a distance modulus of @xmath0 with a dispersion of only 0.05 mag . combining these results with the distance published by graczyk et al .  for the eclipsing binary ogle smc113.3 4007 </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a mean distance modulus to the smc of 18.965 @xmath1 0.025 ( stat . ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 0.048 ( syst . ) mag . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a distance of 62.1 @xmath1 1.9 kpc , where the error includes both uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account other recent published determinations of the smc distance we calculated the distance modulus difference between the smc and the lmc equal to 0.458 @xmath1 0.068 mag . </S>",
    "<S> finally we advocate @xmath2 as a new `` canonical '' value of the distance modulus to this galaxy . </S>"
