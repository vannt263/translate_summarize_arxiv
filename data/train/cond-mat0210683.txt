    "ordered states of matter are characterized by broken symmetry . depending on various real - world details , this may be relatively easier or harder to detect experimentally , but once detected it is unambiguous .",
    "the notion that order parameter fluctuations are important in the disordered phase proximate to an ordered state is a rather obvious extension of the idea of broken symmetry ; however , this notion is more difficult to define precisely . to develop this important concept",
    ", we will discuss strategies for detecting quantum fluctuating order in the particular context of high - temperature superconductor .",
    "we will focus on the detection of stripe order in the putative stripe liquid phase of these systems .",
    "more generally , we are interested in electronic liquid crystalline states and their associated fluctuations @xcite , but the results are also easily generalized to other forms of order .    since the whole notion of fluctuating order is based on proximity of an ordered state , it is essential first to establish the existence of the `` nearby '' ordered state by directly detecting the relevant broken symmetry .",
    "the ordered phase may be induced by making small changes to the chemical composition of the material , applying pressure or magnetic fields , etc . unless an actual ordered state can be reached , it is dangerous to speculate about the effects of related fluctuating order .",
    "typically , the best way to detect both the broken - symmetry state and the relevant fluctuations is by measuring the appropriate dynamical structure factor , @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , x - ray and neutron scattering studies have provided the best evidence of ordered and fluctuating stripe phases , as we shall discuss . however , in many interesting materials , appropriate crystals are not available and so such experiments are not possible . here , probes of local order , such as nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) , muon spin rotation ( @xmath1sr ) , and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) techniques , may be the best available .",
    "all of these are quasi - static ( _ i.e. _ , nearly zero frequency ) probes . in a pure quantum system , in its disordered phase , the order - parameter fluctuations are not static , but rather fluctuate with a characteristic frequency that grows with the distance @xmath2 to the quantum critical point . thus ,",
    "unless something is done to `` pin '' these fluctuations , they are invisible to local probes . such pinning is induced by boundaries , vortices , crystal - field effects , weak quenched disorder , etc .    * in this article * , we first discuss results obtained for solvable model systems , which we analyze in various ways to illustrate the optimal strategies for extracting information about local order",
    ". in particular , much of this discussion addresses the character of the local order in a quantum disordered phase close to a quantum critical point ; we believe that the intuitions gleaned from this study are more generally valid , but without the nearness to the critical point as a small parameter , it is difficult to treat the problem in a controlled fashion .",
    "we also review in some depth , although by no means exhaustively , the experimental evidence of various forms of stripe order in the cuprate superconductors .",
    "there are several related topics that we do not cover in this article ; instead , we direct the interested reader to recent reviews . specifically , the mechanism of stripe formation is given short shrift , and the possible relevance of local stripe order to the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity and to the various remarkable normal state properties observed in the cuprates is only touched on briefly .",
    "more broadly , the context for this review is the role of `` competing orders '' in high temperature superconductors .    in section [ general ]",
    "we discuss basic scaling considerations that govern the relevant length , frequency , and energy scales of fluctuating order in the neighborhood of a quantum critical point , and the consequences of the pinning induced by disorder and other perturbations .",
    "we show that it is the low frequency part of the dynamical structure factor , rather than its integral over all frequencies , that contains the clearest information concerning local order .",
    "we also define a new response function which determines the local density - of - states modulations induced by a weak - impurity potential . finally , we sketch various possible versions of the phase diagram of a system with competing stripe and superconducting phases .    in section [ 1deg ] ( and appendix [ sec : luttinger ] ) , we consider a theoretically well understood system , the one dimensional electron gas ( 1deg ) in the presence of an impurity .",
    "we compute the local density of states ( ldos ) , as would be measured in stm , and the dynamical structure factor , and show by this explicit example how the general considerations articulated in the present paper are manifest in this solvable model .",
    "( the 1deg can also be viewed as a quantum critical state associated with charge density wave ( cdw ) order . ) in addition to its pedagogical value , this section contains explicit results that should be useful for analyzing stm experiments on quasi 1d systems with dilute impurities , such as the chain - layers of ybco @xcite , or stm experiments on carbon nanotubes @xcite .    in section [ 2deg ]",
    "we calculate the ldos in the context of a simple model - system with quasiparticles and incipient order - the weakly - interacting electron gas in two dimensions .    in section [ detection ]",
    "we discuss applications of these ideas to experiments in the cuprates . in section [ diffraction ]",
    "we discuss diffraction studies , and in section [ stm ] stm studies .",
    "this latter section contains new insights concerning the optimal way to analyze stm data to extract information about fluctuating order ; applying these ideas to the recent experimental results of @xcite , and @xcite , reveals the existence of a nearby stripe ordered phase in optimally doped bscco .",
    "section [ nematic ] contains a discussion of experiments to detect local nematic order , and a discussion of recent stm evidence of such order on the same bscco surfaces . in section",
    "[ 18 ] , we discuss indirect evidence of stripe order that comes from the `` 1/8 anomaly . '' in section [ other ] we briefly discuss other probes of stripe order , including nmr , nqr and @xmath1sr .    in section[weak ] , we address an important issue of perspective : in the weak coupling limit , the electronic properties of a solid are essentially determined by the quasiparticle band structure , while collective modes and various forms of order reflect slight rearrangements of the states near the fermi surface .",
    "often these effects can be plausibly treated in the context of a hartree - fock or rpa treatment of the residual interactions .",
    "conversely , in the strong coupling limit , the physics is more simply understood in terms of interacting collective modes , such as spin waves , superconducting phase fluctuations , and the `` phonons '' of a charge - ordered state . here , we discuss the interrelation between these opposite perspectives . in particular we present evidence that the stripe order observed in the cuprates and related compounds is best thought of as arising from the strong - coupling antiferromagnetism of the undoped mott insulating parent compounds than from the more conventionally metallic physics of the strongly overdoped materials .",
    "our most important conclusions are embodied in five numbered `` lessons , '' which are stated in sections [ general ] , [ 1deg ] and [ 2deg ] , and summarized in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "since the discovery@xcite of high temperature superconductivity in the cuprate superconductors , there has been intense interest in the question of how a mott insulating antiferromagnet is converted , upon doping , into a high temperature superconductor .",
    "generally , in electronic systems , there is a competition between the kinetic energy ( fermi pressure ) which favors a uniform fermi liquid phase with sharply defined , itinerant quasiparticles , and the coulomb repulsion between electrons , which favors various forms of insulating magnetic and/or charge ordered states .",
    "thus , it should not be at all surprising to find various forms of charge ordered states appearing in doped antiferromagnets .",
    "in particular , `` stripe '' states have consistently turned up in theoretical studies of doped antiferromagnets , including early hartree - fock solutions of the hubbard model , studies of coulomb frustrated phase separation , slave - boson mean - field theories of the t - j model , and various monte - carlo and dmrg studies of t - j and hubbard models .",
    "the discovery   of stripe order in and soon after in @xcite added considerable credibility to the suggestion that stripe states form an important bridge between the mott insulator , and the more metallic state at heavy doping .",
    " stripes \" is a term that is used to describe unidirectional density wave states , which can involve unidirectional charge modulations (  charge stripes \" ) or coexisting charge and spin density order (  spin stripes \" ) .",
    "cdw states can occur in the weak coupling limit if there are sufficiently well nested portions of the fermi surface . from the strong coupling perspective , stripes are a real - space pattern of micro - phase separation ( hence the name ) , driven largely by a lowering of the doped - hole kinetic energy , in which the doped holes are itinerant in metallic rivers , and the antiferromagnetic correlations of the parent insulator are preserved in between . although the characteristic dynamics of the stripes may be quite different in these two limits , as are the possible implications for other physical properties , from a broken symmetry viewpoint there is no difference between a unidirectional cdw and a stripe - ordered state .    since the principal purpose of the present paper is to address questions concerning the existence of local stripe order we will for the most part consider unidirectional cdw and stripe order as two limits of the same physics .",
    "indeed , it is important to stress that the microscopic mechanism of stripe formation in particular materials is still not clear .",
    "questions such as whether or not the long - range coulomb interactions are important have been widely debated , but remain unresolved .",
    "there is always a linear coupling between any form of charge order and equal period lattice distortions , so it is obvious that lattice distortions play a significant role in enhancing all the observed stripe phenomena , whether or not they are fundamental to the mechanism .",
    "this observation is further corroborated by the observed stabilization of stripes by particular orientational orders of the apical oxygens in some of the cuprates  @xcite , and by a series of thermal transport  @xcite and isotope effect  @xcite anomalies associated with the onset of stripe order  @xcite .      in 2d ,",
    "an ordered stripe phase with the stripes running in the @xmath3 direction gives rise to new bragg peaks in the electronic charge scattering ( and corresponding peaks in the nuclear scattering ) at @xmath4 and harmonics , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the charge - stripe period .",
    "where spin order coexists with charge order , new magnetic bragg peaks occur at harmonics of @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the nel ordering vector .",
    "charge stripes break rotational symmetry and translation symmetry perpendicular to the stripes - in a crystal , these are to be interpreted as breaking of the crystal symmetry group , rather than the continuous symmetries of free space .",
    "the relevant order parameter , @xmath9 , is the fourier component of the electron charge density at the ordering wave vector .",
    "if the state is , in addition , a conducting or superconducting electron fluid , it is a charge stripe smectic .",
    "spin stripes , in addition , break spin - rotational and time reversal invariance ( although a particular combination of time reversal and translation is preserved ) .",
    "wherever there is spin - stripe order , there is necessarily @xcite charge - stripe order , as well .",
    "the new order parameter which distinguishes the spin stripe phase , @xmath10 , is the fourier component of the spin - density .",
    "there is more than one possible stripe - liquid phase . in particular",
    ", there is the possibility of a `` stripe nematic '' phase , in which thermal or quantum fluctuations have caused the stripe - ordered state to melt ( _ i.e. _ , translational symmetry is restored ) but orientational symmetry remains broken ( _ i.e. _ , a snapshot of the system is more likely to see stripe segments oriented in the @xmath3 than @xmath11 direction ) .",
    "the nematic shares with a charge - ordered state a precise definition in terms of broken symmetry . the order parameter can be taken to be any physical quantity transforming like a traceless symmetric tensor .",
    "for instance , the traceless part of the dielectric tensor is a measure of nematic order of the charged fluid . in two dimensions , a useful nematic order parameter is also  @xcite @xmath12)}{s({\\bf k})+s({\\cal r}[{\\bf k } ] ) } , \\label{n}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is a rotation by @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the thermodynamic ( equal - time ) structure factor .",

    "slightly larger than @xmath29 , @xmath32 has a pole corresponding to a sharply defined elementary excitation ; this  soft - mode \" is the quantity which condenses across the quantum critical point , so its quantum numbers and characteristic wave vector directly encode the nature of the nearby ordered state . at somewhat higher energy (",
    "typically , for @xmath33 ) @xmath34 exhibits a multi - particle continuum .",
    "deep in the continuum the system effectively exhibits scale invariance and it behaves in much the same way as if it were precisely at the quantum critical point .",
    "both in this high frequency regime and at the quantum critical point the notion of a quasiparticle is , truly speaking , ill - defined , although for systems with small anomalous dimension @xmath35 ( the typical case for @xmath26 ) the continuum will often exhibit features ( branch - points , not poles ) whose dispersion resembles that of the goldstone modes of the ordered phase .",
    "the quantum disordered phase looks like the ordered phase is thus not completely correct .",
    "there is , however , a more nearly correct version of this statement : at high frequencies , on both the ordered and disordered sides of the quantum critical point , the system looks quantum critical , and so looks the same whichever state is being probed . ]    a classical critical point is described by thermodynamics alone , so none of these dynamical considerations affect the critical phenomena . in particular , it follows from the classical limit of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem that @xmath36 , so @xmath37 has the same critical behavior as the ( static ) susceptibility , @xmath38 , even though @xmath37 involves an integral over the dynamical structure factor at all frequencies .",
    "consequently , a growing peak in @xmath39 at the ordering vector , @xmath40 with width @xmath41 , and amplitude @xmath42 reflects the presence of fluctuating stripe order near a thermal transition . here",
    "@xmath43 is typically about 1 or greater , so the amplitude is strongly divergent .",
    "the situation is quite different at a quantum critical point , where the dynamics and the thermodynamics are inextricably linked . here",
    ", the fact that the largest contribution to @xmath39 comes from the high frequency multi - particle continuum which does not directly probe the fluctuating order means that the relevant structure in @xmath39 is relatively small , and can be difficult to detect in practice . to see this",
    ", we compare the expressions in terms of the dissipative response function , @xmath44 , for the susceptibility ( obtained from the kramers - krnig relation ) and @xmath39 ( obtained from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ) : ( * k*,=0)= & & ^ ( * k*,)/ + [ chi ] s(*k*)= & & ( 2 ) ^(*k * , ) in the limit @xmath16 , @xmath45 ; then clearly , the factor @xmath46 weights the important low frequency part of the integral expression for @xmath38 much more heavily than in the expression for @xmath37 . consequently , it follows under fairly general circumstances@xcite from the scaling form of @xmath47 that @xmath48 , or in other words that @xmath49 is strongly divergent in the neighborhood of the quantum critical point , while @xmath50 is much more weakly divergent , or , if perchance @xmath51 , not divergent at all . at criticality ( @xmath52 ) ,",
    "similar considerations imply that @xmath32 is a less singular function at small momentum / frequency than the corresponding susceptibility .",
    "these considerations apply even on the ordered side of the quantum critical point , where the bragg peak makes an exceedingly small ( although sharp ) contribution to the total structure factor which vanishes in proportion to @xmath53 . by contrast , the bragg peak constitutes the entire contribution to @xmath54 , and is the dominant piece of the structure factor integrated over any small frequency window which includes @xmath55 .",
    "* lesson # 1 : * there is an important lesson to be gleaned from this general discussion concerning the best way to analyze experiments .",
    "it is the low frequency part of @xmath32 which is most directly sensitive to the stripe order . rather than analyze @xmath39 , information concerning local stripe order",
    "is best obtained by studying @xmath56 or by analyzing the partially - frequency - integrated spectral function , @xmath57 where on the ordered side of the critical point , the smaller @xmath58 the better , while on the quantum disordered side , @xmath58 must be taken larger than @xmath28 , but not more than a few times @xmath28 .",
    "this quantity is less severely contaminated by a  background \" arising from the incoherent high energy excitations . as we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ diffraction ] , this is precisely the way local stripe order is best detected in clean , high temperature superconductors .      in the absence of quenched disorder , there is no useful information available from the structure factor at frequencies less than @xmath29 , which means in particular that static experiments ( @xmath55 ) are blind to fluctuating order .",
    "however , a small amount of quenched disorder , with characteristic energy scale @xmath59 but much smaller than the  band width \" of the continuum of the spectral function , has important effects on the low - energy states .",
    "it is intuitively clear that induced low - frequency structure of @xmath32 will be largest for values of @xmath18 where , in the absence of disorder , @xmath37 has spectral weight at the lowest frequencies ,",
    "_ i.e. _ , for @xmath60 .",
    "although the effects of quenched randomness on the pure critical theory can be subtle @xcite , and are rarely well understood ( unless disorder happens to be irrelevant ) , low - energy states are frequently produced .",
    "* lesson # 2 : * the upshot is that the effect of weak quenched randomness in a quantum disordered phase is to produce a low frequency  quasi - elastic \" part of the spectral function @xmath32 . in other words , disorder will eliminate the spectral gap , but will only weakly affect the partially integrated spectral function , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sch - int ] ) , with the integration scale set by @xmath61 .",
    "in particular , in the presence of weak disorder , the static structure factor , @xmath62 , should exhibit similar @xmath18 dependence as @xmath63 of the pure system , and so can be used to reveal the nature of the nearby ordered phase .      to formalize some of these notions , we consider the somewhat simpler problem of the response of the system to a weak , applied external field which couples to the order parameter . in a quantum disordered phase the existence of an order parameter can only be made apparent directly by coupling the system to a suitable symmetry - breaking field . for a charge - stripe smectic , a non - uniform potential couples to the order parameter and thus serves as a suitable symmetry breaking field .",
    "thus , the fourier component @xmath64 of a weak potential induces a non - vanishing expectation value of the order parameter which , in linear response , is @xmath65 the linear response law of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nq ] ) is valid provided @xmath66 is sufficiently small .",

    "many local probes , including stm and nmr , are more sensitive to the local density of electronic states , @xmath72 .",
    "again , in the quantum disordered state , translation invariance implies that , in the absence of an external perturbation , @xmath73 is independent of @xmath74 . in the presence of a weak potential , it is possible to define a relation for the local density of states @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the fourier transform of @xmath77 . from linear response theory",

    "it is also interesting to consider stripe orientational ( nematic ) order .",

    "it is important to note that the density modulations , reflecting the proximity of stripe order , are a first order effect , while the nematic response , which differentiates @xmath19 from @xmath90 $ ] , is second order , and so will tend to be weaker , even if the nematic quantum critical point is nearer at hand than that involving the stripe - ordered state .",
    "when there is more than one competing ordered phase , the phase diagram can be very complicated , and moreover can be quite different depending on various microscopic details . nonetheless , it is often useful to have a concrete realization of the phase diagram in mind , especially when thinking about issues related to order , and order parameter fluctuations . in this subsection ,",
    "we sketch schematic phase diagrams which characterize some of the ordered phases and fluctuation effects discussed above ; the reader is cautioned , however , that the shape , topology , and even the number of ordered phases may vary for material - specific reasons .    figure  [ phase](a ) represents the essential features we have in mind , in the absence of any quenched disorder . here , there is a stripe ordered phase which occurs at low doping and low temperature , with a phase boundary which ends at a quantum critical point deep in the superconducting phase . in the region",

    "notice that this fluctuation region extends into the stripe ordered phase itself ; although there is true long - range stripe order in this region of the phase diagram , close to the quantum critical point the degree of striping at the local level is much greater than the small ordered component .",
    "there is no universal statement possible concerning how far the fluctuating stripe region extends beyond the ordered phase .",
    "clearly , if the region in which there is _ local _ stripe order does not at least include the entire region of the phase diagram in which high temperature superconductivity occurs , it can not be essential for the mechanism of superconductivity .",
    "under many circumstances , the stripe ordered phase will not end at a quantum critical point , but rather will terminate at a first order line @xcite .",
    "if the transition is only weakly first order , this will not affect the general considerations presented here .",
    "if it is strongly first order , fluctuation effects are much weaker , and the effects of even very weak quenched disorder are much more severe than in the case of a continuous transition .",
    "this limit warrants further study @xcite , both for application to the cuprates and more generally ; it is likely relevant for the organic superconductors.pf@xmath91 @xcite . ]",
    "figure  [ phase](b ) is a more ornate version as the local stripe order is suppressed upon overdoping .",

    ", we illustrate the case in which the nematic , charge , and spin ordering occur at distinct transitions , under which circumstances the nematic ordering must precede the charge ordering , which must in turn precede the spin ordering @xcite . in general , there are also distinctions between commensurate and incommensurate , diagonal and vertical , bond - centered and site centered stripe order , so the same general considerations could lead to significantly more complicated phase diagrams .",
    "since the superconducting order is suppressed in the vortex state , and eliminated above @xmath92 , studies of the magnetic - field - induced changes in the local stripe order have recently emerged as one of the best ways of determining the nature of the interplay between stripe and superconducting order .",

    "there are a few important features of generalized friedel oscillations which follow from general principles .",
    "if the liquid state is proximate to a highly anisotropic state , such as a stripe state , the values of @xmath297 at which @xmath38 has maxima will reflect the pattern of spatial symmetry breaking of the ordered state , but @xmath296 will respect the full point - group symmetry of the crystal unless the liquid state spontaneously breaks this symmetry , _",
    "e.g. _ , is a nematic .",
    "so , the generalized friedel oscillations around a point impurity in a stripe - liquid phase will inevitably form a checkerboard pattern , unless some form of external symmetry breaking field is applied @xcite .",
    "there is another form of spatial modulation of the density of states , one with a period which disperses as a function of the probe energy , which is sometimes ( incorrectly , we believe ) referred to in the stm literature as friedel oscillations .",
    "this latter effect , which was first demonstrated by @xcite , is produced by the elastic scattering of quasiparticles of given energy off an impurity .",
    "the resulting interference between scattered waves leads to variations of the local density of states at wave vectors @xmath298 , where @xmath222 and @xmath299 are the wave - vectors of states with energy @xmath300 , as determined by the band structure , @xmath301 .",

    "modulations which reflect the spectrum of elementary excitations are distinguishable @xcite from those related to incipient order in a variety of ways : whereas incipient order produces effects peaked near isolated ordering vectors , @xmath303 , the single particle effects are peaked along extremal curves in @xmath222 space which disperse as a function of @xmath81 .",

    "naturally , in the presence of true long range charge order @xmath76 should exhibit sharp ( resolution - limited ) peaks which reflect the charge density modulation in real space .",

    "the constancy of the phase implies that the location in real - space of the density of states modulation is fixed at all energies , which strongly indicates that it reflects pinned incipient order .",

    "specifically , @xcite and still more recently @xcite have suggested that the peaks seen in @xmath76 can be accounted for entirely in terms of the interference pattern of sharply defined quasiparticles in a d - wave superconductor , with no need to invoke incipient stripe order - or any non fermi liquid character of the elementary excitations , for that matter .",
    "let us briefly review the line of reasoning that leads to this conclusion .    as we have seen ( lesson # 4 )",
    ", interference between quasiparticles in 2d naturally produces ridges in @xmath76 along closed curves in @xmath18 space , rather than the peaks observed in experiment .",
    "however , as was first recognized by @xcite , this result is modified by the extreme eccentricity of the contours of constant quasiparticle energy in a d - wave superconductor , where the dispersion in one direction is @xmath330 and in the other is proportional to @xmath331 .",
    "consequently , with finite experimental resolution , at energies less than @xmath331 , one obtains peaks in the interference patterns at points in @xmath222 space which connect the tips of the contours that surround each of the four distinct nodal points on the fermi surface .",
    "specifically , if we assume that there are well defined quasiparticles with energy obtained by solving the bogoliubov - de  gennes equations for a d - wave superconductor , then for each energy @xmath81 there are eight values @xmath332 ( two in the neighborhood of each nodal point ) which simultaneously satisfy the equations @xmath333 ( _ i.e. _ , they lie on the normal state fermi surface ) and @xmath334 ( _ i.e. _ , the quasiparticle creation energy is @xmath81 ) .",
    "peaks in @xmath76 will then occur at the various distinct values of @xmath335 , of which there are 7 distinct ( up to symmetry ) values .",
    "for instance , the two wave vectors with smallest magnitudes are @xmath336 and @xmath337 which come from the interference between the state @xmath338 and , respectively , the states at @xmath339 and @xmath340 . the positions of the peaks in @xmath319 thought to correspond to @xmath341 and @xmath342 from the work @xcite are reproduced in fig .  [ davisfig ] . given the quasiparticle interpretation of the stm spectrum , then from the observed location of any two distinct peak positions @xmath343 at a given energy",
    ", it is possible to reconstruct the positions of all eight locations in the brillouin zone , @xmath332 which give rise to all the expected peaks at this energy .",
    "thus , where 7 distinct peaks are observed ( as are reported by @xcite in some ranges of energy ) , the quasiparticle spectrum is highly over - constrained , and this provides a very stringent self - consistency check on the quasiparticle interpretation . according to @xcite , the peaks they observe generally pass this consistency check .",
    "the experimental case for dispersive features in @xmath76 that are consistent with the quasiparticle interference mechanism is quite persuasive .",
    "the controversy over interpretation revolves around the degree to which quasiparticle interference is sufficient to explain all of the structure in @xmath76 . examining fig .",
    "[ davisfig](a ) , one can see that for energies below @xmath344  mev , @xmath341 lies close to the expected stripe ordering vector , @xmath345 .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental measurements and analysis by @xcite , who had interpreted this behavior as evidence for stripe order ; in contrast , @xcite argued that the continuity with the dispersive signal favors a single mechanism based on band structure effects .",
    "( from stm measurements on near optimally doped ) at wavevectors a ) @xmath346 ( along the @xmath324 direction ) and b ) @xmath347 ( along the @xmath348 direction ) from fig . 4 of @xcite .",
    "the solid lines are from a global fit to the arpes spectrum , as described in the text .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in weighing these alternatives , it is useful to consider a second consistency check that the quasiparticle picture should satisfy .",
    "while , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ convolution ] ) , @xmath76 is actually a measure of a two - particle response function , to the extent that it is dominated by single - particle effects it should be expressible in terms of a convolution of single - particle green functions , as in eq .",
    "( [ convolution ] ) .",
    "thus , it should be consistent with the behavior of the spectral function measured in arpes . in evaluating this",
    "connection , significant challenges arise with respect to the sufficiency of the quasiparticle interpretation .    in the first place , arpes consistently reveals strong deviations from a non - interacting line shape .",
    ", where even at low temperatures there is no evidence of well defined quasiparticles . ]",
    "well below @xmath259 , the measured energy distribution curve ( edc ) at fixed @xmath349 on the fermi surface consists of a dispersing  quasiparticle - like \" peak with a small weight , @xmath350 , and a broad , and largely featureless multiparticle continuum which contains most of the spectral weight .",
    "moreover , the quasiparticle peak is always anomalously broad with a distinctly non - fermi liquid temperature and energy dependence @xcite .",
    "if this measured spectral function were used to predict the structure of @xmath76 , then the quasiparticle interference features would be weak @xcite ( in proportion to @xmath351 ) , which is something of a surprise given the apparent robustness of the experimental features .",
    "one might also expect the interference features to be broadened significantly by the short quasiparticle lifetimes at the probed energies .",
    "perhaps the most important consequence is that the intensities of the structures should have a dramatic temperature dependence , going to zero as @xmath352 goes to zero at @xmath259 .",

    "[ davisfig ] , as originally emphasized by @xcite , that there are significant discrepancies between the arpes and stm results , especially below 20  mev . in particular , in the region of @xmath18 space near the expected stripe - ordering wave vector , @xmath360 ,",
    "the stm spectrum is considerably less dispersive than would be expected on the basis of the arpes data ; it appears that the peak in @xmath76 largely stops dispersing when it reaches this magic wave vector ( see for instance the discussion surrounding eq.([kstar ] ) . ) for non - interacting quasiparticles .",
    "for instance , @xmath76 was recently computed by @xcite for non - interacting quasiparticles scattering from a point impurity ; it is apparent from their fig .  4",
    "that , at energies of 20  mev and below , there is a local _ minimum _ in the neighborhood of @xmath40 , rather than a peak ! the same is apparent in figs .  2 and 3 of @xcite .",

    "both are highly surface sensitive probes , so there is always the issue of whether either is telling us anything about the bulk properties of the materials , but this worry does not affect the comparison between the two sets of measurements .",
    "it seems significant to us that the most serious quantitative differences between the arpes dispersion and those inferred from a quasiparticle interpretation of the stm data occur at low energies , and are particularly pronounced for @xmath18 s near @xmath345 , where effects of incipient stripe order are largest . in this context , it is worth noting that in the stm studies of @xcite shown in fig .",
    "[ howald ] , a peak at @xmath40 is seen in all the curves with @xmath361  mev all the way to @xmath362 ! ( @xcite and @xcite do not report spectra below about 6  mev .",
    "it is possible that , as suggested by @xcite , that this difference is a consequence of the stripe signal being washed out due to the existence of many domains in the larger field of view used in the experiment of @xcite . )    moreover , in their stm study of the magnetic - field - induced structure in vortex - core halos , @xcite observed oscillations at precisely these same wave vectors , @xmath40 , in the energy - integrated ldos ( in a 12  mev window about 0 voltage ) .",
    "the amplitude of these latter oscillations is very large compared with that of the disorder - induced signal , and the dominant contribution comes from energies around 7  mev .",
    "we believe that the issues of interpretation can be definitively resolved by studies of the temperature and impurity concentration dependence of the signal . since the contribution to @xmath76 from quasiparticle interference is proportional to @xmath351 , and",
    "since @xmath352 is observed in arpes experiments to have a strong temperature dependence and vanish above @xmath259 , it should be very easy to quench the interference signal by heating ; what is left at temperatures approaching @xmath259 can not be due to quasiparticle interference . and , of course",
    ", above @xmath259 in overdoped samples , and above a suitable pseudogap temperature in underdoped samples , the superconducting gap vanishes , so only the more usual rings can possibly arise from quasiparticle interference .",
    "conversely , as discussed previously , light zn doping is known to pin stripes in , so it is reasonable to expect the same effect in .",
    "thus , stripe - related signals should be strengthened , and made less sensitive to thermal depinning by small concentrations of zn impurities in the cu - o planes .",
    "stm studies at elevated temperatures are technically demanding , but recently @xcite have achieved atomic scale resolution at temperatures well above @xmath259 on a surface .",
    "they report that for @xmath363 many of the peaks in @xmath364 have , indeed , been extinguished . however , the low energy portion of the peak at @xmath341 ( in fig .",
    "[ davisfig ] ) remains unattenuated , and even survives , well above @xmath259 .",
    "this effect clearly can not be explained by the quasiparticle interference mechanism .",
    "an explanation in terms of pinned stripes seems much more plausible ( although the persistence of a stripe - induced signal at such an elevated temperature requires further investigation ) .",
    "one further feature of all the data that has been reported to date is worth commenting on is the large ( factors of 2 or 3 ) differences that are observed @xcite in the peak intensities at @xmath19 and @xmath365 $ ] .",
    "systematic experiments have not , yet , been conducted to verify whether this effect is real , or an experimental artifact . if it is not an artifact , then this observation is among the first microscopic pieces of evidence of a strong local tendency to stripe orientational ( _ i . e. _ , nematic ) order .",
    "in addition , such large anisotropies are something that can not be accounted for in any simple way by quasiparticle interference ( nor local checkerboard order ) .",
    "it is important to bear in mind , however , that even if the observed anisotropy reflects nematic order , it is expected to decrease in magnitude @xcite in direct proportion to @xmath366 , where @xmath126 is the area of the field of view , due to the unavoidable domain structure produced by quenched disorder .",
    "while stripe order necessarily implies nematic order , the converse is not true .",
    "although nematic order involves the spontaneous breaking of a spatial ( point - group ) symmetry , when there is no accompanying breaking of translation symmetry , even the identification of the ordered state is somewhat subtle , and this holds doubly for fluctuation effects .",
    "moreover , since quenched disorder is always relevant and results in domain structure , true macroscopic measurements of spontaneous nematic symmetry breaking are not possible .",
    "the difficulty of detecting the rotational - symmetry breaking associated with ordered stripes is illustrated by the case of , a non - superconducting structural analogue of .",
    "even transmission electron microscopy , which is capable of measuring over a fairly small sample area , tends to yield superlattice diffraction peaks for stripe order that reflect the 4-fold symmetry of the nio@xmath305 planes in the tetragonal crystal structure @xcite .",
    "only recently have electron diffraction patterns consistent with the 2-fold symmetry of an ordered stripe domain been reported @xcite .",
    "thus , almost all tests of nematic order in solids necessarily involve the observation of an unreasonably large , and strongly temperature dependent anisotropy in the electronic response to a small symmetry breaking field which favors the @xmath11 direction over the @xmath3 direction .",
    "an example of a system in which this approach has been successfully applied is provided by the 2deg in quantum hall devices .",
    "while the fractional quantum hall effect dominates the physics at very high magnetic fields , at intermediate magnetic fields ( so that more than one landau level is occupied ) , it has recently been discovered @xcite that there are a set of anisotropic states which have been identified @xcite as being quantum hall nematics , and which can be thought of as melted versions of the long predicted @xcite quantum hall smectic ( or stripe ) phases .",
    "these phases are characterized by a large resistance anisotropy , @xmath367 , which onsets very strongly below a characteristic temperature , @xmath368  mk .",
    "the precise origin of the symmetry breaking field which aligns the nematic domains in these experiments has not been unambiguously determined @xcite . however , by applying @xcite an in - plane magnetic field , the magnitude of the symmetry breaking field can be varied , and the transition can be significantly rounded ( giving evidence @xcite that local stripe order persists up to temperatures well in excess of @xmath369 ) , and even the orientation of the nematic order can be switched , resulting in a state with @xmath370 .    experiments that involve such fine control of an external symmetry - breaking field are considerably harder to carry out in the context of the cuprates .",
    "some of the relevant materials , such as and with @xmath371 , have an orthorhombic axis at 45@xmath372 to the expected stripe directions ( _ i.e. _ , a nematic phase can be defined in terms of spontaneous breaking of the mirror plane which lies along the orthorhombic @xmath373-axis . ) in these materials , if one wishes to align the nematic domains , one must apply a suitable external symmetry - breaking field such as a uniaxial strain or in - plane magnetic field ; however , such experiments tend to be challenging .",
    "when the principle axes of an orthorhombic phase lie parallel to the expected stripe directions , the orthorhombicity ( typically @xmath374%  in cuprates ) plays the role of a small , external symmetry - breaking field .",
    "examples where this occurs are superconducting with @xmath375 and non - superconducting with @xmath376 . in both of these cases ,",
    "resistivity anisotropies as large as a factor of 2 have been observed @xcite in detwinned single crystals . moreover , as in the quantum hall case , this anisotropy is strongly temperature dependent ; in , @xmath377%  for temperatures in excess of @xmath378  k. polarization dependent measurements of the infra - red conductivity on a detwinned @xmath379 crystal of reveal that the frequency dependence of the conductivity anisotropy has a scale comparable to @xmath380 @xcite .",
    "large anisotropies in the frequency - dependent conductivity have also been observed @xcite in  and in yba@xmath305cu@xmath268o@xmath381 , although in those cases , some part of the conductivity anisotropy must be due directly to the cu - o chains . taken together , these various observations are circumstantial evidence of a fair degree of local stripe order , and of the presence of a nematic phase ; the trouble being that , without a somewhat quantitative theory ( which does not exist ) , it is hard to say how large an observed resistance anisotropy must be to be accepted as being an `` unreasonably large '' response to the orthorhombicity , that is , one that can only be understood in terms of the alignment of nematic domains .",
    "more subtle investigations of orientational symmetry breaking can be undertaken by studying the transport in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "a very clever approach along these lines was introduced by @xcite .",
    "they applied a voltage along one axis of the cuo@xmath305 planes and a magnetic field perpendicular to the planes in order to break the 4-fold symmetry of the crystal structure and to obtain evidence of one - dimensional charge transport . in a stripe - ordered state ,",
    "the geometry used should be sensitive primarily to those domains in which the stripes are aligned parallel to the direction of the applied voltage . for @xmath382 , they found that , within the stripe - ordered phase , the transverse conductivity tends to zero at low temperature while the longitudinal conductivity remains finite .",

    "alternative explanations in terms of anisotropy associated with spin - orbit coupling in the antiferromagnetic phase have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "this example illustrates the difficulty in making a unique association between a bulk anisotropy and microscopic stripe order .",

    "this has been confirmed , for example , in where quasi - elastic magnetic scattering from spin - stripe order has been detected @xcite for @xmath11 in the neighborhood of 1/8 ; in low - energy inelastic measurements , @xcite have shown that the magnetic peak width is most narrow at @xmath422 .",

    "the fact that quasi - elastic magnetic order as detected by neutron scattering onsets at a considerably higher temperature than that detected by @xmath1sr is clearly a consequence of the inevitable glassiness of a density - wave transition in the presence of quenched disorder ; it reflects the differences in the time scales of the two probes , not the presence of two distinct ordering phenomena . more recently ,",

    "the thermal conductivity increases slightly on cooling through the charge - ordering transition , exhibiting a normal peak at @xmath441  k. the suppression of the latter peak in superconducting has been attributed to the scattering of phonons by fluctuating stripes @xcite .",
    "the doping dependence of the thermal conductivity measured in and in mercury - cuprates has been interpreted as evidence for a 1/8 anomaly in those materials @xcite .",
    "an enhancement of the thermal conductivity in la@xmath442ba@xmath271cuo@xmath268 was originally noted by @xcite    indirect evidence of some form of local charge order can also be gleaned from the response of a system to electro - magnetic radiation . for instance , raman scattering @xcite was recently used to reveal charge ordering , and more importantly ( for present purposes ) to detect the effect of collective cdw motion at higher temperatures in sr@xmath443cu@xmath444o@xmath445 , a ladder system with a local electronic structure very similar to that of the cuprate superconductors .",
    "careful measurements of the optical response of optimally doped have revealed @xcite infrared active phonons with oscillator strength comparable to those in the undoped insulating compound .",
    "this has been plausibly interpreted as giving evidence of `` fluctuating charge inhomogeneities '' in the copper - oxide planes - the point being that for the phonons to be unscreened at that frequency , their local environment on some scale must be insulating .",
    "arpes experiments can also be interpreted as giving indirect evidence of local stripe order . at an empirical level , this can be done by looking @xcite at the evolution of the arpes spectra in a sequence of materials in the family in which various types of stripe order have been detected ; this provides a basis for identifying similar features in the arpes spectrum of materials in which stripe order has not been established .",
    "for instance , stripe long - range order produces a tendency for the fermi surface in the antinodal region of the brillouin zone to be flat ( one - dimensional ) , and to suppress spectral weight in the nodal region .",
    "some of these same features , especially the differing impact on the nodal and antinodal regions , are induced by zn doping of , as well , plausibly reflecting @xcite the tendency of zn to pin local stripe order .",
    "more broadly , many of the most striking features of the observed @xcite arpes spectra can be naturally interpreted in terms of an underlying quasi one - dimensional electronic structure @xcite .",
    "examples of this are the disappearance of the the coherent quasiparticle peak @xcite upon heating above t@xmath446 , the dichotomy between the widths of the peaks as a function of momentum and energy in the normal state spectrum @xcite , and the general structure of the spectra and the evolution of the fermi surface with doping @xcite .",
    "finally , several probes have been used to search for the inhomogeneous distribution of bond - lengths expected from the lattice response to local charge stripe order .",
    "pair - distribution - function ( pdf ) analysis of scattering data and extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) spectroscopy can detect instantaneous distributions of nearest - neighbor bond lengths .",
    "both techniques have the potential to provide indirect evidence of dynamical , as well as static , stripes ; however , whether they have sufficient sensitivity to detect the very small bond - length variations associated with charge modulation in the cuprates remains a topic of some contention .",
    "@xcite reported a doping - dependent broadening of the in - plane cu - o bond - length distribution in detected by pdf analysis of neutron powder diffraction data .",
    "while the reported doping dependence is intriguing , the maximum enhancement of the bond - length spread is much too large to be compatible with the debye - waller factors measured in a single - crystal neutron diffraction experiment on la@xmath266sr@xmath267cuo@xmath268 by @xcite a much more extreme discrepancy occurs with the exafs studies of ( and other cuprates ) by bianconi s group @xcite .",
    "they report a low - temperature splitting of the in - plane cu - o bond lengths of 0.08   , which is not only incompatible with a large number of diffraction studies , but is also inconsistent with exafs analysis performed by other groups @xcite .",
    "large atomic mean - square displacements detected in by ion channeling @xcite have been attributed to transitions associated with dynamic stripes , but the magnitude of the displacements and the temperature dependence are difficult to reconcile with other experiments .    in short , these various local measures of the distribution of lattice displacements",
    "are , in principle , a very good way to look for local charge - ordering tendencies , but it is important to reconcile the results obtained with different techniques . where apparent inconsistencies exist , they must be resolved before unambiguous inferences can be made .",
    "order in simple metals is typically thought of as arising from a fermi surface instability caused by the weak residual interactions between the lowest energy quasiparticles . specifically , density wave order occurs when the band structure is such that there are nearly nested segments of the fermi surface .",
    "thus , even at temperatures above the ordering temperature , or if the interactions are slightly weaker than the critical strength needed for ordering , there will often be structure in the appropriate dynamical structure factors due to this near nesting which in some sense reflect the fact that the metal is close to an ordered state . in this section , we will analyze the connection between this weak - coupling fermi - liquid theory based perspective and the description in terms of the collective modes of the ordered or nearly ordered state which we have taken until now .    it is worth mentioning at the outset that one difficulty arises from the relative paucity of established theoretical results in the strong coupling limit .",
    "more than half a century of concerted work has produced a rather complete understanding of the effects of weak residual interactions on the properties of a well formed fermi liquid in a simple metal .",
    "however , only in special circumstances is a comparably sound and complete understanding available in a strongly interacting system .",
    "for instance , in the weak coupling limit , considerable useful information about the quasiparticle spectrum can be adduced directly from transport data , because boltzmann transport theory relates the two properties in a precise manner .",
    "the theory of transport in a strongly interacting system is , in our opinion , not established .",
    "the upshot of this is that it is much easier to point to experiments that show that simple , weak coupling ideas _ can not _ be safely applied in many highly correlated materials , than to point to experiments that show that strong coupling notions _",
    "can be_.        as mentioned in the introduction , stripe - ordered states are ultimately defined by a specific set of broken symmetries . from this viewpoint",
    ", there is no distinction between the strong coupling limit , in which spin stripes can be viewed as micro phase separation of charges into an array of rivers with strips of nearly insulating antiferromagnet between them , and the weak - coupling hartree - fock description of a sdw which opens small gaps on various nearly nested segments of the fermi surface .",
    "indeed , in many circumstances , the two limits are adiabatically connected as a function of the interaction strength . however ,",
    "this is not guaranteed .",
    "for instance , a stripe - ordered state can be either metallic or insulating . at @xmath117 ,",
    "metallic and insulating stripes are thermodynamically distinct states of matter .",
    "there is a more subtle possible distinction possible between metallic spin - stripe states in the weak and strong coupling limits .",
    "certainly , in the weak - coupling limit , the ungapped portions of the fermi surface support well - defined quasiparticles , so the system remains a fermi liquid unless , at still lower temperatures , it suffers an additional ordering transition , say to a superconducting state . on the other hand , in the strong coupling limit , the metallic behavior in the stripe ordered phase may or may not be well characterized by fermi liquid power laws . it is now established that non fermi liquid states can , in principle , exist in more than one dimension .      even where no sharp thermodynamic distinctions exist",
    ", there are very many clear physical differences between the weak and strong coupling limits . of these",
    ", the most obvious is the relative importance of electron quasiparticles with a sharply defined fermi surface . in the weak coupling limit",
    ", the quasiparticle is the essential building block in terms of which all other properties are derived . in the strong coupling limit , by contrast , even where it might be the case that well - defined quasiparticles ( with very small weight , @xmath352 ) are recovered in the strict @xmath16 limit , such coherence may require such low temperatures as to be only of academic interest .",
    "thus , on a practical level , `` effective non - fermi liquids , '' in which the majority of the electronic excitations in the experimentally relevant ranges of temperature , energy , and wave - number are not well defined quasiparticles , can not be sensibly treated in terms of a weak coupling approach .",
    "conversely , where well defined quasiparticles are everywhere manifest , there is an a priori reason to prefer a weak coupling viewpoint .",
    "another set of important of quantitative distinctions concern the @xmath18 and @xmath121 dependences of the magnetic dynamical structure factor , @xmath34 . in a one band - model of non - interacting electrons ,",
    "the integral of @xmath37 over all @xmath18 and @xmath121 is @xmath448 $ ] while in the large interaction ( local moment ) limit it is @xmath449 , which is not dramatically different .",
    "however , in weak coupling , the integrated intensity comes from a very broad range of energies , of order @xmath450 , and momenta , of order @xmath107 , while for an antiferromagnet the integral is dominated by energies less than the exchange energy , @xmath451 , and is highly peaked near the magnetic ordering vector , whether or not the system is actually ordered .",
    "put another way , in weak coupling the structure factor is dominated by the particle hole continuum , and there are signatures of well defined collective modes ( spin waves ) only at energies @xmath452 , while in the strong coupling limit , deep in the ordered phase , spin - waves dominate the structure factor even at energies of order @xmath451 .",
    "also , in the ordered state at weak coupling , the ordered moment @xmath453 at @xmath117 is small , @xmath454 , while in the strong coupling limit , not too close to a quantum critical point , @xmath455 is large .    as a concrete example , let us first consider the structure factor of a non - interacting electron gas in 2d .",
    "for momenta @xmath456 it is @xmath457 when @xmath458 and zero otherwise .",
    "( the expression for @xmath459 is somewhat more complicated . ) clearly , the spectral weight is distributed smoothly over the entire support of this particle - hole continuum , _",
    "i.e. _ , over a range of momenta of order @xmath107 and of energies of order the band width . from the weak coupling perspective",
    "the chief qualitative effect of interactions is to produce ( quasi)bound states that manifest themselves as peaks at or below threshold of the continuum . in the broken - symmetry phase",
    "these bound states are goldstone modes , which descend down to zero energy and loose weight to the new bragg peaks .",
    "what is important to note here is that even in the broken - symmetry phase , most of the spectral weight remains in the incoherent background spread more or less uniformly over energies of order band width .",
    "in contrast , consider the zero temperature structure factor of an insulating antiferromagnet computed to first order in a @xmath460 expansion , where @xmath37 is formally the magnitude of the spin , but more physically should be viewed as the  distance \" of the system from the nearest quantum disordered phase . here , on a square lattice , @xmath461 where @xmath462 is the spin wave dispersion ( which depends on the lattice and the details of the exchange interactions ) , @xmath463 is a unit vector parallel to the magnetization , and @xmath464 .",
    "( higher order terms in @xmath460 typically produce finite lifetimes for all but the lowest energy spin waves , and also give rise to a multi spin wave continuum . ) as promised , the basic energy scale is set by @xmath451 , and a large portion of the total spectral weight is found in a small region of @xmath18 space around @xmath465 .",
    "note that the energy scale @xmath451 can be deduced from the value of the spin wave energy near the zone boundary , @xmath466 , for @xmath467 . even in the thermally disordered state , so long as @xmath468 , the zone edge spin wave can be studied to get an idea of the relevant energy scales for magnetic excitations .",
    "finally , distinctions can be drawn based on the sensitivity of the various signatures of order or proximate order to various weak perturbations : weak disorder , as we have discussed extensively above , can serve to pin fluctuating order , and hence enhance the small @xmath121 portion of @xmath0 .",
    "however , in weak coupling , the principal effect of weak disorder is to scatter the quasiparticles , and thus broaden any fermi surface features ( _ i.e. _ , nested segments ) which might give rise to peaks at particular @xmath469 s in @xmath0 .",
    "thus , in weak coupling , we expect weak quenched disorder to suppress , rather than enhance low frequency signatures of stripe order or incipient stripe order",
    ". distinct responses to an applied magnetic field can also be expected to differentiate the weak and strong coupling limits .",
    "in particular , where the zero - field ground state is superconducting , induced order in vortex cores occurs under broad circumstances in the strong - coupling limit where there are competing orders ; this sort of phenomena is generally much less prominent in the weak coupling limit .",
    "these issues are discussed in a number of good recent reviews - see footnotes 23 and 24 .",
    "it is worth remembering that in many materials , the interaction strength is comparable to the fermi energy , _",
    "i.e. _ , stability of matter ( or some memory of the virial theorem ) conspires to place systems in the awkward regime of intermediate coupling . here , neither the weak nor strong coupling approaches are well justified , and one is typically forced to extrapolate results beyond their regime of validity . in this case",
    ", it is generally sensible to study the problem from both the strong and weak coupling perspectives .",
    "some features ( such as those that are most sensitive to the presence of a particle - hole continuum ) may be best viewed from the weak coupling perspective , while others ( such as the role of collective modes ) may be better viewed from strong coupling .    one traditional way to understanding",
    "this regime is to include the effects of interactions in the context of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) . for the complex spin susceptibility @xmath38 ,",
    "one writes @xmath470 where @xmath215 is the susceptibility for noninteracting electrons , and @xmath235 characterizes the interaction . in the case of dominantly forward - scattering interactions ( such as the long - range piece of the coulomb interaction ) , the rpa summation of bubble diagrams is justified even when the interactions are relatively strong .",
    "for the case of short - range interactions , no such systematic justification exists to the best of our knowledge .",
    "however , the results obtained from rpa are explicit and often intuitively appealing .",
    "it is certainly reasonable , at least on a phenomenological level , to compare the results of an rpa treatment with experiment to determine whether the physics is simply connected to the weakly - interacting limit , or on the other hand whether the interactions produce qualitatively new phenomena .",
    "one of the first rpa calculations was performed by @xcite to model the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations detected by nmr ; for the interaction , they selected @xmath471 , the on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "@xcite found significant structure in the bare @xmath472 from nearly - nested features of the fermi surface . by suitable choice of the chemical potential , and inclusion of band narrowing by a factor of 24 compared to band structure calculations , they were able to find reasonable agreement with the early inelastic neutron scattering measurements of low - energy magnetic excitations in  @xcite .",
    "calculations for @xcite have typically found it necessary to employ the rpa expression with @xmath473 $ ] ( or a similar form ) in order to obtain reasonable consistency with experiment .",

    "in addition , we note that the lack of dispersion of the spin gap that develops below @xmath259 in @xcite , together with the enhancement of intensity above the gap @xcite , have been interpreted in terms of the spin response of the electrons that participate in the superconducting state @xcite .      from a purely theoretical perspective",
    ", it may not be possible to determine _ a priori _ whether there is an advantage to either a weak- or strong - coupling approach ; however ,",

    "is given by @xmath624 where we have used the charge and spin complex coordinates @xmath625 and @xmath626 .",
    "the susceptibility @xmath627 is obtained , upon analytic continuation to real frequencies , from @xmath628 the result for the integrated density of states @xmath200 presented in section [ 1deg ] , eq .",
    "( [ eq : int - high ] ) follows from integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi - ft ] ) over energies large compared with the low - energy cutoff @xmath138 .",
    "here we explain some of the assumptions behind the parameter values specified in table  [ tab : mag ] . for antiferromagnetic phases ,",
    "the meaning of the parameters is relatively straightforward , but extracting parameters from measurements on doped systems can require extrapolations from simple models . note that we have not addressed important issues related to possible novel forms of orbital magnetism that have been proposed @xcite .        in the case of long - range antiferromagnetic order ,",
    "the absolute magnitude of the average ordered moment per planar cu , @xmath453 , is obtained from an elastic neutron diffraction measurement by comparing the intensities of the magnetic bragg superlattice peaks with those of bragg peaks from the chemical lattice .",
    "it has been observed that @xmath453 is correlated with the nel temperature , @xmath629 , in both  @xcite and  @xcite . in the earliest measurements of ,",
    "samples typically contained excess oxygen , resulting in values of @xmath453 and @xmath629 significantly lower than those of the stoichiometric material .",
    "another complication is that determination of @xmath453 requires knowledge of the magnetic form factor , which turns out to be considerably more anisotropic @xcite than was appreciated initially .    for comparison ,",
    "it is worth noting that for a spin @xmath630 heisenberg model on a square lattice with only nearest neighbor interactions , the magnitude of the average ordered spin per cu , to second order in a @xmath460 expansion @xcite , is @xmath631 . for a moment due to spin only , @xmath632 and @xmath633 .",
    "although it has not been possible to measure the @xmath634 factor for cu in the layered cuprates , in planar cuprates @xcite . ]",
    "a typical value for a cu@xmath635 ion in a distorted octahedral environment is 2.2 @xcite , which implies a typical moment of 0.67  @xmath636 .",
    "the fact that the observed maximum moments in  and  are 10 to 20%  smaller than this could be a result of hybridization of the cu @xmath504 orbital with o @xmath637 orbitals .",
    "( by symmetry , the net spin density on oxygen sites is zero in the nel structure . )      in @xmath1sr , one measures a precession frequency , which is directly proportional to the local hyperfine field at the @xmath638 site .",
    "determination of the absolute moment requires knowledge of the @xmath638 location ( obtained by calculation rather than experiment ) and a calculation of the magnetic field at that site due to the ordered cu moments . alternatively , under the assumption that the @xmath638 site is unchanged by doping , one can determine the local moment in a doped sample relative to that in the parent insulator .",
    "an advantage of the @xmath1sr technique is that its sensitivity does not depend on the existence of long - range order .",
    "a beautiful example of this is the study of @xcite in which it was shown that the local ordered moment ( at very low temperature ) changes little as long - range antiferromagnetic order is destroyed by doping in  and y@xmath501ca@xmath431ba@xmath305cu@xmath397o@xmath91 . in a complementary study , @xcite have shown that substantial moments associated with local antiferromagnetic order ( presumably stripe order pinned by the tetragonal structure ) are present in la@xmath639eu@xmath476sr@xmath431cuo@xmath268 for @xmath640 .    in a stripe - ordered sample , the muons sample a distribution of local hyperfine fields , resulting in a fairly rapid damping of the precession signal @xcite .",
    "the relative moment quoted in the table corresponds to the maximum of that distribution .",
    "neutron scattering measures the dynamical magnetic structure factor @xmath641 . actually , the spin structure factor is the tensorial quantity @xmath642 , which obeys the sum rule @xmath643 where @xmath37 is the spin per magnetic ion . for cuprates in general , and superconducting samples in particular",
    ", it is challenging to measure the magnetic scattering to sufficiently high energies ( with sufficient signal - to - noise ratio ) that the sum rule can be evaluated ; however , there do exist a few studies that allow one to evaluate the energy integral up to 100 mev .",
    "while there are significant uncertainties in evaluating the integral from published data , these should be smaller than the uncertainty in the calibration of the sample volume contributing to the signal , which for superconducting samples can be on the order 30%@xcite .",
    "since we are interested in the change of this integrated quantity with doping , we have normalized it to the value measured for the relevant parent antiferromagnet .",
    "note that for the latter case , the integral includes the signal in the magnetic bragg peaks as well as that from the spin waves .",
    "another quantity that one can evaluate is the relative weight under the resonance peak , which appears below @xmath259 in the superconducting state .",
    "values , normalized to the full sum rule weight , have been tabulated by @xcite . for  samples with @xmath259 varying from 52 to 93",
    "k , they found the normalized weight to be about 1.5% ; for a sample of  with @xmath644  k , the value is @xmath645% .",
    "it should be noted that integrating @xmath646 up to 100  mev for the experimental measurements on antiferromagnetic yba@xmath305cu@xmath397o@xmath647 @xcite gives just 20%  of the full sum rule weight ; hence , using the same normalization as for @xmath648 in table  [ tab : mag ] , the weight of the resonance peak in  is about 0.08 .        in the spin - wave theory of a heisenberg model on a square lattice with only nearest - neighbor coupling , the zone - edge magnon with @xmath649 has energy @xmath650 , where the final equality applies for @xmath651 .",
    "longer - range couplings have observable effects in the spin - wave dispersion curves measured for @xcite ; nevertheless , it is useful to characterize @xmath652 , which is essentially the local energy to flip a spin , in terms of @xmath503 . assuming that a local super - exchange coupling is still active between local moments in doped samples , we have used the same formula to define @xmath503 in terms of the maximum spin - excitation energy observed in superconducting cuprates .",
    "while raman scattering is not sensitive to individual spin waves , it does provide a valuable probe of two - magnon correlations in 2d square - lattice antiferromagnets @xcite .",
    "the dominant part of the response has @xmath653 symmetry and appears at low temperature as a strong peak in intensity , with the peak occurring at an energy of @xmath654 for @xmath651 and @xmath655 for @xmath656 @xcite .",
    "the scattering mechanism is believed to involve relatively short - range excitations , so that the response is not strongly sensitive to the existence of long - range order .",
    "although there is no formal justification for it , we have used the formula for peak energy in the antiferromagnetic state in order to extract a characteristic value for @xmath503 from the 2-magnon signal measured from superconducting samples . note that there are also results available on  @xcite which we have not included in table  [ tab : mag ] ."
