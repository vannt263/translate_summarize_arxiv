    "we congratulate the three authors for opening such a new vista for running mcmc algorithms in state - space models .",
    "being able to devise a correct markovian scheme based on a particle approximation of the target distribution is a genuine `` tour de force '' that deserves an enthusiastic recognition !",
    "this is all the more impressive when considering that the ratio @xmath0 is not unbiased and thus invalidate the usual importance sampling solutions , as demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "thus , the resolution of simulating by conditioning on the lineage truly is an awesome resolution of the problem !",
    "we implemented the phm algorithm for the ( notoriously challenging ) stochastic volatility model @xmath1 based on several hundred simulated observations .",
    "with parameter moves @xmath2 and state - space moves derived from the ar(1 ) prior , we obtained good mixing properties with no calibration effort , using @xmath3 particles and @xmath4 metropolis ",

    "( left ) _ and pairwise _ ( right ) _ graphs for the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 sequences for the same target as in figure [ param].,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the acceptance rate for this configuration , when using a variance of @xmath12 for each parameter move , and @xmath13 particles for @xmath8 observations , was around 25% . with @xmath13 observations and @xmath13 particles , the results of the phm algorithm showed a bimodality in the markov chain as presented in figure [ d100 ] .",
    "the sequence of the @xmath6 s on the lhs of figure [ d100 ] exhibits concentrations around both @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this bimodality of the posterior on @xmath6 disappears when the number of observations grows , as shown by figures [ acf ] and [ d1000 ] , obtained with @xmath16 simulated observations and @xmath16 particles .",
    "bimodality of the posterior on @xmath6 could possibly occur for a larger number of observations .",
    "it may also be an artifact of the simulation method , which would require a higher number of particles or of iterations to assess .",
    "unfortunately , this is computationally very demanding : using our python programme on @xmath17 iterations , @xmath16 observations and @xmath16 particles requires five hours on a mainframe computer .",
    "figures [ d100 ] and [ d1000 ] , obtained with the same proposal variance , also illustrate the severe decrease in the acceptance rate when the number of observations grows : the proposed parameter values get rejected for more than 100 iterations in a row on figure  [ d1000 ] .",
    "our computer program is written in the python language .",
    "it is available for download at ` http://code.google.com/p/py-pmmh/ ` and may be adapted to any state - space model by simply rewriting two lines of the code , namely those that ( a ) compute @xmath18 and ( b ) simulate @xmath19 . contemplating a different model",
    "does not even require the calculation of full conditionals , in contrast to gibbs sampling .",
    "another advantage of the ` py - pmmh ` algorithm is that it is trivial to parallelise .",
    "( adding a comment before the loop over the particle index is enough , using the ` openmp ` technology . )",
    "although this is already addressed in the last section of the paper , we mention here possible options for a better recycling of the numerous simulations produced by the algorithm .",
    "this dimension of the algorithm deserves deeper study , maybe to the extent of allowing for a finite time horizon overcoming the mcmc nature of the algorithm , as in the pmc solution of @xcite .",
    "a more straightforward remark is that , due to the additional noise brought by the resampling mechanism , more stable recycling would be produced both in the individual weights @xmath20 by rao ",
    "blackwellisation of the denominator in eqn .",
    "( 7 ) as in @xcite and over past iterations by a complete reweighting scheme like amis @xcite .",
    "another obvious question is whether or not the exploitation of the wealth of information provided by the population simulations is manageable via adaptive mcmc methods @xcite",
    "since @xmath21 is an unbiased estimator of @xmath22 , there must be direct implications of the method towards deriving better model choice strategies in state - space models , as exemplified in population monte carlo by @xcite in a cosmology setting .",
    "in fact , the paper does not cover the corresponding calculation of the marginal likelihood @xmath23 , the central quantity in model choice .",
    "however , the pmcmc approach seems to lend itself naturally to the use of chib s ( @xcite ) estimate , i.e. @xmath24 for any @xmath25 . provided",
    "the @xmath26 density allows for a closed - form expression , the denominator may be estimated by @xmath27 where the @xmath28 s , @xmath29 are provided by the mcmc output .    the novelty in andrieu et al .",
    "( 2009 ) is that @xmath30 in the numerator needs to be evaluated as well .",
    "fortunately , as pointed out above , each iteration @xmath31 of the pmcmc sampler provides a monte carlo estimate of @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the current parameter value .",
    "some care may be required when choosing @xmath25 ; e.g. selecting the @xmath25 with largest ( evaluated ) likelihood may lead to a biased estimator .",
    "we did some experiments in order to compare the approach described above with inla @xcite and nested sampling ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , using the stochastic volatility example of rue et al .",
    "unfortunately , our pmcmc program requires more than one day to complete ( for a number @xmath34 of particles and a number @xmath35 of iterations that are sufficient for reasonable performance ) , so we were unable to include the results in this discussion .",
    "a likely explanation is that the cost of pmcmc is at least @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the sample size ( @xmath38 in this example ) , since , according to the authors , good performance requires than @xmath39 , but our implementation may be sub - optimal as well .",
    "interestingly , nested sampling performs reasonably well on this example ( reasonable error obtained in one hour ) , and , as reported by @xcite , the inla approximation is fast ( one second ) and very accurate , but more work is required for a more meaningful comparison .",
    "two interesting metrics for the impact of a read paper are : ( a ) the number of previous papers it impacts in some way ; and ( b ) the number of interesting theoretical questions it opens . in both respects ,",
    "this paper fares very well .",
    "regarding ( a ) , in many complicated models the only tractable operations are state filtering and likelihood evaluation , as shown , e.g. , in the continuous - time model of @xcite . in such settings ,",
    "the phm algorithm offers bayesian estimates `` for free '' , which is very nice .",
    "similarly , @xcite , see also @xcite , formulates change - point models as state - space models , where the state @xmath40 , comprises the current parameter @xmath41 and the time since the last change @xmath42 . in this",
    "setting , one may use smc to recover the trajectory @xmath43 , i.e. , all the change dates and parameter values .",
    "it works well when @xmath44 forgets about its past quickly enough , but this forbids hierarchical priors for the durations and the parameters .",
    "phm removes this limitation : chopin s ( 2007 ) smc algorithm may indeed be embedded into a phm algorithm , where each iteration corresponds to a different value of the hyper - parameters .",
    "this comes as a cost however , as each mcmc iteration need run a complete smc algorithm .    regarding point ( b ) , several questions , which have already been answered in the standard smc case ,",
    "may again be asked about pmcmc : does residual resampling outperform multinomial resampling ? is the algorithm with @xmath45 particles strictly better than the one with @xmath34 particles ?",
    "what about rao - blackwellisation , or the choice of the proposal distribution ?",
    "one technical difficulty is that marginalising out components always reduces the variance in smc , but not in mcmc .",
    "another difficulty is that pmcmc retains only one particle trajectory @xmath43 , hence the impact in reducing variability between particles is less immediate .    similarly , obtaining a single trajectory @xmath43 from a forward filter is certainly much easier than obtaining many of them , but this may still be quite demanding in some scenarios , i.e. , there may be so much degeneracy in @xmath46 that not a single particle does contain a @xmath46 that is in the support of @xmath47 .",
