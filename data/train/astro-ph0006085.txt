    "dwarf - novae , among the cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , are semi - detached binary star systems where a white - dwarf ( primary star ) accretes gas from a cool companion ( secondary star ) .",
    "the gas from the secondary star accretes through the inner lagrangian point ( l1 ) , into the primary roche lobe and slowly spirals in toward the white - dwarf .",
    "the in - flowing gas forms an accretion disk which orbits around the white - dwarf before actually being accreted onto the primary star . during the time the gas is within the accretion disk ,",
    "current theory tells us that half of the gravitational energy of the gas is radiated outward while that which remains heats the accretion disk . indeed most of the visible and ir light output by a typical dwarf - novae is from the accretion disk ( , ) .",
    "emission lines seen in the spectra of a dwarf - nova arise from the vicinity of the accretion disk and can be double peaked due to the doppler motions of the disk within the binary @xcite .",
    "the velocity of the material within the disk , together with the emitted flux distribution over the disk , determines the line profile shape .",
    "consequently , spectral line analysis is a fundamental method employed to understand the physical state of the accretion disk and its spatial flux distribution .",
    "the most common emission lines used in such analyses are those due to hydrogen and helium .    [ cols=\"^,^,<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the accretion disk radii ratio , r = r@xmath1/r@xmath2 , is often the only value provided by authors because of the large uncertainties affecting the determination of the orbital inclination and the binary star masses .",
    "a commonly applied method to compute r is the one developed by .",
    "smak s method assumes axially symmetric accretion disk in keplerian motion and a power law flux distribution ( @xmath3 ) for the disk emission .",
    "the r and @xmath4 values depend on the parameters u , a@xmath5 , and a@xmath6 which are defined as follow : u=@xmath7 , with @xmath8=instrumental resolution , a@xmath9 , and a@xmath10 , where w@xmath11 , w@xmath12 , and w@xmath13 are the emission line width at the fractions 0.8 , 0.4 , and 0.1 of the peak height above the continuum , respectively .",
    "applied smak s method to wz  sge and determined a@xmath14 , a@xmath15 , and r=0.3 ( see table  [ tab : lastt ] ) .",
    "a ratio r=0.3 is 50% larger than the value 0.2 we determined in section  [ sec : uncontaminated ] .",
    "we investigated such a difference to understand whether it reflects changes in the quiescent accretion disk size or it implies inconsistencies between the smak s method and the method described in section  [ sec : uncontaminated ] .",
    "we applied smak s method to our h@xmath4 and h@xmath16 uncontaminated spectra and found a@xmath5 and a@xmath6 values matching those by mennickent and arenas ( see table  [ tab : lastt ] ) .",
    "however , we expect a ratio @xmath17",
    ". then , we may conclude that : _ i ) _ the two methods are consistent and , in particular , the assumptions of axisymmetric disk and power law flux distribution required by the smak s method are not fundamental to the determination of r and smak s method may be applied also to asymmetric accretion disks such as wz sge ; _ ii ) _ the two accretion disk radii ratio , r=0.3 by mennickent and arenas and r=0.2 by us , may correspond to a real change in wz  sge s quiescent accretion state and indicate an inward motion of the inner accretion disk radius toward the white - dwarf surface ( in section  [ sec : total ] we showed that the outer disk radius remains constant during quiescence ) .",
    "we observed both hot - spot and accretion disk line emission to vary in shape and strength throughout an orbital period , and conclude that both the hot - spot and the accretion disk are asymmetric and anisotropically emitting .",
    "we determined the gas at the impact region to have just the stream velocity , and the accretion disk is a low density gas with little drag effects on the in - falling material from the secondary star . there are different balmer decrements at the impact region and in the rest of the accretion disk , and we conclude that the gas has a different opacity , @xmath18 , within the two regions .",
    "in particular , the hot - spot is optically thick in the lines , while the accretion disk appears to be optically thin in the lines .",
    "our measured radial velocity curves , from five emission lines in the optical and in the infrared are found to present an inconsistent set of system parameters .",
    "we explain this result as a bias due to the hot - spot emission .",
    "in particular , we showed that the hot - spot emission delays the apparent time of the secondary inferior conjunction with respect to photometric phase zero .",
    "we also show that the phase offset depends both on the excitation potential energy of the considered emission line and on the optical depth of the gas in the accretion disk .",
    "our extended analysis of a selected sample of dwarf - novae shows increasing phase offset with shorter orbital period , consistent with the idea of optically thin accretion disks in low mass transfer rate systems .    summarizing our results from the emission line profile analysis and radial velocity curve computations presented here",
    ", we can formulate a probable structure for the wz  sge accretion disk .",
    "the accretion disk is generally a low density , optically thin gas .",
    "the accretion disk is neither symmetric , nor has it a uniform gas density or temperature structure ( see also paper  i ) .",
    "the hot - spot is optically thick in the emission lines , not symmetric in shape , and not an isotropic emitter .",
    "the hot - spot emission arises from a multicomponent extended region in which each emission component is not visible at all phases and the hot - spot emission varies in strength throughout the orbital period .",
    "these variable hot - spot emissions lead to an extended hot - spot region which does not emit strongly when viewed from the down - stream direction ( phase 0.5 and following ) , and shows a temperature gradient along the stream trajectory .",
    "figure  [ fig : geo ] summarizes our conclusion .",
    "the qualitative picture of wz  sge provided by our observations and data analysis shows a peculiar quiescent accretion disk dissimilar to others observed at present .",
    "wz  sge is the first short orbital period dwarf - nova showing evidence of optically thin emission both in the continuum ( , and ) , and the lines .",
    "multicolor photometry of oy  car , z  cha , and ht  cas ( , , ) shows evidence of quiescent accretion disk optically thin in the continuum but thick in the emission lines .",
    "this work establishes a first step toward an understanding of the spatial flux and material distribution within the wz  sge accretion disk and other toad ( tremendous outburst amplitude dwarf - novae , ) candidates .",
    "the accretion disk radii determined in sec.[sec : uncontaminated ] show that determination of the inner and outer radius strongly depend on the assumed white - dwarf mass and the binary orbital inclination .",
    "unfortunately , white - dwarf mass and radius determinations are still affected by large uncertainties .",
    "the uncertainties on the wz  sge white - dwarf parameters prevent us from uniquely determing the actual size of the accretion disk , the fraction of the primary roche lobe it fills , or its exact shape . whether the accretion disk extends down to the white - dwarf surface or",
    "is a ring - like accretion disk as suggested by some previous studies ( , , ) , can not be uniquely determined .",
    "we determined the accretion disk radii ratio in wz  sge , r = r@xmath1/r@xmath2 , to be 0.2 , and observed that the outer accretion disk radius does not vary during the quiescence period .",
    "one explanation for the constant accretion disk outer radius is the assumption that the accretion disk extends to the 3:1 tidal resonance radius .",
    "one possible test of this idea would be to search for and find quiescent super - humps .",
    "the optical data used in this study were obtained by henke spruit and rene rutten with the william herschel telescope of the ing at la palma .",
