    "oxygen is the most abundant element in stars after h and he .",
    "it is produced in massive stars and ejected into the interstellar medium when they explode as type ii sne ( see , for example , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . iron , however , is produced in both type ii and less massive type i sne ( resulting from mass accretion by a c  o white dwarf , @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that type i sne have longer lifetimes offers an opportunity to put some constraints on the time - scale of oxygen and iron production by measuring oxygen overabundance over iron .",
    "it has been argued ( @xcite ) that at least a 10@xmath7-yr delay between type i and type ii sne can lead to an enhancement of the [ o / fe ] ratios in stars formed in very early epochs of the galaxy .",
    "theoretical models of type ii sn element yields show an increase in [ o / fe ] ( as well as other @xmath8 elements ) ratio as a function of the progenitor mass ( @xcite ) .",
    "abundance ratios observed in low - mass metal - poor stars allow estimates of primordial abundances of elements as well as the study of the yields of sne of different progenitor masses .",
    "oxygen abundances have been measured in many globular clusters and metal - poor field stars using : 1 ) the ir triplet located at @xmath4 7774    ( @xcite ; @xcite ; king 1994 ; @xcite ) ; 2 ) the [ ] lines at @xmath9 6300 , 6363    ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and 3 ) the oh lines in the uv ( bessell , sutherland , & ruan 1991 ; nissen et al .",
    "the use of different methods has a simple physical rationale .",
    "the high - excitation ( @xmath10 = 9.15 ev ) triplet at @xmath4 7774    is strong and can be accurately measured in hot halo dwarfs , while forbidden lines are a good tool for cool halo giants .",
    "molecular oh lines in the uv are observed in both giants and dwarfs with @xmath11 6500 k ( oh is destroyed at higher temperatures ) .",
    "the most relevant result from these studies was the confirmation of the theoretically expected oxygen overabundance with respect to iron .",
    "all authors agree on the point that [ o / fe ] increases when [ fe / h ] decreases from 0 to @xmath01 . however , the slope of the [ o / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] dependence and its behavior for metallicities below @xmath01 were not clear .",
    "results of different authors disagree .",
    "studies of [ ] data suggest an [ o / fe ] overabundance of + 0.4 to + 0.5 dex for [ fe / h ] @xmath120.8 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , while the triplet gave systematically higher values ; [ o / fe ] @xmath13 + 0.79@xmath30.29 ( see cavallo et al . 1997 , and references therein ) .",
    "abia & rebolo ( 1989 ) derived oxygen abundances from the ir triplet of 30 dwarfs and subgiants covering a range of metallicities @xmath02.7 @xmath14 [ fe / h ] @xmath14 0 and found that [ o / fe ] reaches 1.01.2 at about [ fe / h]@xmath15 . it became clear that the [ ] line at 6300   give systematically lower abundances compared with the ir triplet .",
    "different ideas appeared in the literature aiming to resolve this discrepancy . king ( 1993 ) has suggested a new temperature scale for metal - poor dwarfs increasing the effective temperatures by 150200 k. however , the validity of the assumptions made in his temperature scale were criticized by balachandran & carney ( 1996 ) . a possible source of systematic errors",
    "could be hidden in the form of the source function of the oxygen triplet .",
    "it was clear that forbidden lines and ir triplet are relatively free from non - lte effects in metal - poor stars ( @xcite ; tomkin et al .",
    "kiselman & nordlund ( 1995 ) proposed that correct radiative transfer in 3-d atmospheric models can decrease the strength of the ir triplet relative to the [ ] .",
    "takeda ( 1995 ) has addressed this problem in terms of the excitation temperature effects after finding that the solar ir triplet weakens when the chromosphere is taken into account in the computations . however , it is not obvious how to apply the ideas of takeda ( 1995 ) and kiselman & nordlund ( 1995 ) to the metal - poor stars .",
    "recent observations and analysis by cavallo et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have shown that the problem remains unsolved .",
    "most of the measurements of the forbidden lines of oxygen have been performed in giants .",
    "barbuy ( 1988 ) and graton & ortolani ( 1989 ) have reported [ o / fe]=0.35@xmath30.15 and [ o / fe]=0.5@xmath30.1 from 20 and 18 field halo giants , respectively .",

    "as regards metal - poor dwarfs , the analysis of [ ] lines has been limited to those of moderately low metallicity because of the low strength of these transitions .",
    "only a few measurements have been reported by spite & spite ( 1991 ) , spiesman & wallerstein ( 1991 ) and nissen & edvardsson ( 1992 ) showing consistent results with previous findings in giants .",
    "an alternative way of deriving oxygen abundances from oh lines in the uv was suggested by bessell , hughes , & cottrell ( 1984 ) .",
    "these lines are very strong and can be measured at much lower abundance levels than is possible with the forbidden or the permitted lines . however",
    ", this measurement requires the use of near - uv high - resolution spectroscopy , which for cool and distant very metal - poor stars can only be obtained in large - diameter telescopes .",
    "in addition , there are a number of difficulties related to the specific problems of deriving abundances from the lines located in the near uv . even with the help of synthetic spectra , the identification of many blends is uncertain . in many cases",
    "it is hard to separate a weak line from the noise or a blend . in order to overcome this difficulty one needs to obtain high - s / n and high - dispersion spectra .",
    "this method has been used by bessell et al .",

    "( 1994 ) who derived oxygen abundances in eight and nine metal - poor stars , respectively .",
    "bessell et al .",
    "( 1991 ) noticed that the low - excitation lines of oh ( @xmath10 = 01.7 ev ) will provide us with more accurate abundances ( compared with the ir triplet ) since these lines are formed in those layers of the atmosphere where the majority of neutral metal lines used for the abundance studies occur .",
    "the oxygen abundances derived from the oh lines were about 0.5 dex lower than those measured from the triplet .",
    "thus , the abundances derived from oh and [ ] agreed , and it was natural to conclude that something was wrong with the ir triplet .",
    "in the present paper , we analyze new oh data and derive oxygen abundances in a larger sample conformed by 23 metal - poor unevolved halo stars and one giant .",
    "we compare our abundances with those from oh , the ir triplet , and [ ] for stars in common with previous works and discuss the implications of our findings .",
    "these observations belong to a wider project aimed at measuring beryllium , oxygen , nitrogen , and carbon abundances in metal - poor stars by using atomic and molecular lines located in the near uv .",
    "the observations were carried out in different runs using the utrecht echelle spectrograph ( ues ) at the nasmyth focus of the 4.2-m william herschel telescope of the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( la palma ) , and the ucl echelle spectrograph ( ucles ) of the 3.9-m anglo - australian telescope .",
    "most of the spectra were obtained using the ues with a resolution of @xmath21 , while the resolution achieved with the ucles was @xmath22 .",
    "a detailed log of the observations , including telescopes , dates , and exposure times can be found in garca lpez et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "all the spectra were reduced using standard iraf procedures ( bias subtraction , flatfield correction , and extraction of one - dimensional spectra ) .",
    "different spectra for each object were co - added before wavelength calibration and continuum normalization .",
    "the final signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio varies for the different echelle orders , being in the range 3050 for most of the stars . the final spectra span from 3025 to 3430   for the ues data , and from 3070 to 3390   for the ucles , including some gaps between the orders .",
    "the 24 stars analyzed in this paper are listed in table 1 .",
    "effective temperatures ( @xmath23 ) were estimated initially using the alonso , arribas , & martnez - roger ( 1996 ) calibrations versus @xmath24@xmath0@xmath25 and @xmath26@xmath0@xmath27 colors , which were derived applying the infrared flux method ( blackwell et al .",

    "all the details on photometric measurements are provided by garca lpez et al .",
    "the selection of metallicities for the program stars was carried out by critically inspecting a large number of published values , and the references can also be found in that work .",
    "surface gravities ( @xmath28 ) were determined by comparing the observed strmgren @xmath29 and @xmath30 indices with synthetic ones generated using the corresponding filter transmissions and a grid of kurucz ( 1992 ) blanketed model atmospheres fluxes .",
    "this is also explained in detail by garca lpez et al .",

    "these values also reproduce well other bluer and redder spectral regions where the oh lines used in this paper are located . in particular , the effective temperatures assigned to our sample agree well with those used by abia & rebolo ( 1989 ) and tomkin et al .",

    "these comparisons and the fact that a change of 100 k in @xmath23 translates into a change of @xmath37 dex in the derived oxygen abundance ( as we will show below ) , limit strongly the abundance differences with previous works which could be attributed to the adopted temperature scale .",

    "however , independently of how careful we were in selecting the oh lines , this strategy does not guarantee complete success due to the large number of unidentified lines in the solar spectrum .",
    "we have avoided an important number of strong oh lines because they were strongly blended with other metals for which we do not have accurate @xmath39 values .",
    "there were several unblended candidate oh lines in the regions @xmath9 3105@xmath310 and 3150@xmath35  , but these were unfortunately located between our echelle orders . with due regard for possible blends , we have selected 8 clean and 3 weakly blended unsaturated features corresponding to the same spectral range available for our stellar observations .",

    "associated with the errors in the transition probabilities of atomic and molecular lines in this region , we adjusted the @xmath38 values of the lines used until we succeeded in reproducing the solar atlas of kurucz et al .",
    "( 1984 ) with solar abundances .",
    "this procedure is , in principle , strictly valid only for stars with characteristics similar to those of the sun , but it has been shown ( e.g. garca lpez , severino , & gomez 1995 ) that it provides consistent results in abundance analyses carried out for metal - poor stars in the near uv .",
    "for the oh lines in particular , this approach is justified so long as solar @xmath39 values are insensitive to the treatment of damping .",
    "this is indeed the case for most of the stars in our sample , for which we have been able to fit the oh lines without assuming any ad hoc values for van der waals broadening ( two exceptions associated with stars of high gravity and low @xmath23 will be discussed separately ) .",
    "we have employed a grid of lte , plane - parallel , constant flux , and blanketed model atmospheres provided by kurucz ( 1992 , private communication ) , computed with atlas9 without overshooting , which are interpolated for given values of @xmath23 , @xmath28 , and [ fe / h ] .",
    "synthetic spectra were obtained using the lte code wita3 , a new unix - based version of code abel6 ( pavlenko 1991 ) .",
    "synthetic solar spectra were computed in the neighborhood of the selected oh lines , and were convolved with a gaussian of fwhm = 0.052   to reproduce the instrumental profile of the solar atlas .",

    "synthetic spectra were convolved with a gaussian with an adequate fwhm to reproduce the resolutions achieved in the ues and ucles spectra , respectively .",
    "table 3 lists the abundances derived from each line considered with respect to the solar abundance ( [ o / h]=log ( o / h)@xmath46log ( o / h)@xmath47 ) , and the mean value from all lines . the lack of data in the table corresponds mainly to the bluest region where the signal - to - noise ratios were the lowest for most of the stars , as well as to those cases in which a combination of low s / n and weak lines did not allow us to derive the abundance .",
    "hd 166913 is the worst case with only two lines .",
    "it also appears that the unblended @xmath4 3255   line located in a high - s / n region gives the lowest abundances for several stars , but we have no reasons to discard it a priori .",
    "figure 2 shows different examples of comparisons between synthetic and observed spectra .",
    "two stars of the sample , hd 64090 and hd 103095 , with low effective temperature and high surface gravity , show observed oh line profiles which are narrower than the corresponding synthetic ones .",
    "the instrumental profile associated with their spectra is the same as that corresponding to other stars observed with the ues spectrograph , and for which we have obtained a good fit to the observed lines . to improve the fit , ya .",
    "v. pavlenko kindly included an option in wita3 to compute damping constants for a few molecules ( including oh ) , which was applied to the analysis of these two stars .",
    "the resulting synthetic spectra were much closer to the observed ones with this improvement , although in general they were still a little poorer than those obtained for the rest .",
    "to check the sensitivity of the derived oxygen abundances to the input stellar parameters , we computed the changes in several of the strongest oh lines associated with variations of the stellar parameters for a set of model atmospheres ( @xmath23=5000 , 5600 , and 6200 k , @xmath28=3 and 4 , and [ fe / h]=@xmath48 and @xmath49 ) .",

    "surface gravity works in the opposite direction , and a change of @xmath52 dex in @xmath28 corresponds to a change of @xmath53 dex in [ o / h ] , whereas an error in metallicity of 0.3 dex implies an uncertainty of @xmath54 dex in [ o / h ] .",
    "the same results have been obtained by nissen et al .",
    "( 1994 ) using osmarcs model atmospheres ( edvardsson et al .",
    "1993 ) , and a different line list . in our syntheses we used a fixed value for the microturbulence , @xmath55 , and",
    "we confirm the previous finding by nissen et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , which indicated that errors in the microturbulence and in the differential abundance , [ c / fe ] , can be neglected .",
    "the uncertainties associated with the stellar parameters were estimated for each star by taking these values into account and combining them in quadrature .",
    "systematic errors , like unrecognized line blends and the continuum placement , also arise in this process . the location of the continuum constitutes a serious problem for low - s / n uv data .",
    "these errors vary from star to star . in many cases",

    "the situation is especially complex for stars with metallicities [ fe / h]@xmath56 .",
    "spectra of stars with [ fe / h]@xmath57 can be compared with the sun in order to make an accurate differential analysis , while the continuum can be placed more easily in the spectra of very metal - poor stars due to the disappearance of a large number of weak metallic lines .",
    "a measure of these uncertainties can be obtained from the dispersion ( standard deviation ) in abundances found from different oh lines , which are listed in table 2 . in a typical case ( with s / n@xmath58 and based on 9 lines )",

    "we have discussed above the reliability of oxygen abundances derived from oh lines in metal - poor dwarfs and we are driven to conclude that the [ o / fe ] ratio is systematically higher in dwarfs than in giants ( up to 0.5 dex ) . does this mean that o is depleted in giants , or is this discrepancy related to problems in the analysis of giants or in the analysis of the forbidden lines in general ?    it is well known that the analysis of chemical abundances in cool metal - poor giants is subject to significant uncertainties .",

    ". therefore , there are reasons to be cautious when inferring conclusions from these measurements in giants and it would be worth measuring different oxygen spectral lines in these stars . nevertheless , it is possible that the oxygen content of metal - poor giants is really lower on average than in dwarfs of similar metallicity .",
    "a plausible reason for this is mixing of nuclear - processed material , depleted in oxygen , with the upper atmospheric layers .",
    "evidence for oxygen depletion in globular - cluster giants , associated with n enhancements , has been found by pilachowski ( 1988 ) , and low ratios of @xmath111c/@xmath112c and @xmath111c/@xmath113n have been discovered in several metal - poor giants ( sneden , pilachowski , & vandenberg 1986 ) , indicating depletion of carbon .",
    "a global anticorrelation between o and na has been discovered by cohen ( 1978 ) and peterson ( 1980 ) and confirmed by more recent studies of giants in m13 , m3 , and m5 ( kraft et al .",
    "1992 , 1995 ; kraft 1994 ; minniti et al .",
    "recently pilachowski , sneden , & kraft ( 1996 ) compared na abundances in 60 metal - poor halo subgiants , giants and horizontal - branch stars with similar metallicities ( but of higher luminosity ) in globular clusters .",
    "they found a small effect of increasing [ na / fe ] by 0.12 dex when moving from halo subgiants to horizontal - branch stars , which could be interpreted as due to the dredgeup of na - enriched material from cno burning .",
    "in addition to cno elements , na , mg and al abundances are also correlated in a large number of globular cluster stars ( kraft 1994 ) showing the general effects of mixing .",
    "however , the degree of mixing which can be appealed is restricted by observables like the @xmath111c/@xmath112c ratios , since it is likely that on - cycled material will also show very low ratios .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "sweigart & mengel ( 1979 ) have already proposed meridional currents to cause the mixing of cno products with the upper atmosphere .",
    "it also became clear that na and al enhancements observed in many globular - cluster giants ( kraft 1994 ) can be produced by the @xmath114ne(p,@xmath115)@xmath116na reaction of the nena - cycle ( langer , hoffman , & zaidins 1997 , and references therein ) .",
    "however , the fact that @xmath114ne is not an abundant part of ne suggests considering the @xmath113n(@xmath8,@xmath117)@xmath118f(@xmath119,@xmath120)@xmath118o(@xmath8,@xmath115)@xmath114ne reaction as a source of @xmath114ne .",
    "thus , one would need a material which had undergone significant o@xmath121n or c@xmath121n processing . in the o - depleted layers one would also expect a transformation of the @xmath122 mg and @xmath123 mg isotopes of mg into al in the mgal - cycle ( langer , hoffman , & sneden 1993 ) .",

    "they have proposed a mechanism which combines primordial abundance anomalies with deep mixing .",

    "n correlation observed in field halo giants . even without going into details of the theory which explains depletion of different elements and their mixing with an upper atmosphere",

    "the most metal - deficient star in our sample ( bd @xmath125233130 ) is a giant , and it is possible that the [ o / fe ] derived for this star is not primordial for the reasons mentioned above , but , even removing this object from the plot , the evidence for any flattening of the distribution of points at very low metallicites is very marginal , and it seems that the [ o / fe ] ratio continues increasing below [ fe / h]@xmath13@xmath126 .",
    "it is of considerable importance to extend the number of oxygen measurements at such low metallicities to investigate the nucleosynthesis by supernovae at early times , the mixing of the ejected material in the interstellar medium ( audouze & silk 1995 ) , as well as the possible existence of a pre - galactic population of super - massive stars .",

    "<S> oxygen is found to be overabundant with respect to iron in these stars , with the [ o / fe ] ratio increasing from 0.6 to 1 between [ fe / h]=@xmath01.5 and @xmath03.0 . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the oxygen overabundance with respect to [ fe / h ] is similar to that seen in previous works based on ir triplet data ( abia & rebolo 1989 ; tomkin et al . </S>",
    "<S> 1992 ; cavallo , pilachowski , & rebolo 1997 ) . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the previously accepted picture , our oxygen abundances , derived from low - excitation oh lines , agree well with those derived from high - excitation lines of the triplet . for nine stars in common with tomkin </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a mean difference of 0.00@xmath30.11 dex with respect to the abundances determined from the triplet using the same stellar parameters and model photospheres . for four stars in our sample </S>",
    "<S> we have found measurements of the [ ] @xmath4 6300   line in the literature , from which we derive oxygen abundances consistent ( average difference 0.09 dex ) with those based on oh lines , showing that the long standing controversy between oxygen abundances from forbidden and permitted lines in metal - poor unevolved stars can be resolved . </S>",
    "<S> our new oxygen abundances show a smooth extension of the edvardsson et al.s ( 1993 ) [ o / fe ] versus metallicity curve to much lower abundances , with a slope @xmath5 ( taking into account the error bars in both oxygen abundances and metallicities ) in the range @xmath03@xmath1[fe / h]@xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolation of our results to very low metallicities indicates that the first type ii sne in the early galaxy provided oxygen to iron ratios [ o / fe]@xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the oxygen abundances of unevolved stars when compared with values in the literature for giants of similar metallicity imply that the latter may have suffered a process of oxygen depletion . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , unevolved metal - poor stars shall be considered better tracers of the early evolution of oxygen in the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the higher [ o / fe ] ratios we find in dwarfs has an impact on the age determination of globular clusters , suggesting that current age estimates have to be reduced by about 12 gyr . </S>"
