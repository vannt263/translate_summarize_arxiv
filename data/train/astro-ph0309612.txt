    "a number of diffuse , steep - spectrum radio sources without optical identification has been observed in galaxy clusters .",
    "these sources have complex morphologies and show diffuse and irregular emission @xcite .",
    "they are usually subdivided into two classes , denoted as ` radio halos ' and ` radio relics ' ( a more detailed classification scheme is put forward by @xcite ) .",
    "cluster radio halos are unpolarised and have diffuse morphologies that are similar to those of the thermal x - ray emission of the cluster gas . unlike halos ,",
    "radio relics are typically located near the periphery of the cluster ; they often exhibit sharp emission edges and many of them show strong radio polarisation . for more details on observations of diffuse cluster radio sources the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite .",
    "the origin of these diffuse radio sources is still not entirely clear .",
    "two processes for the formation of radio relics have been proposed , both of which invoke the action of shock waves .",
    "shock waves are produced in the course of structure formation , e.g. by mergers between , and accretion onto clusters of galaxies @xcite , and may provide the necessary acceleration of the electrons .",
    "the two most important mechanisms that are believed to produce radio relics are : ( i ) in - situ diffusive shock acceleration by the fermi  i process @xcite and ( ii ) re - acceleration of electrons by compression of existing cocoons of radio plasma @xcite . in all the aforementioned scenarios the diffuse radio emission is associated with shock - fronts .",
    "some of the relics are characterised by highly structured morphologies and those are more likely to have been produced by the compression scenario @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the latter types of relics , i.e. those that are produced by compression of old radio cocoons .",
    "when a radio ghost , an old invisible radio galaxy cocoon , is passed by a cluster merger shock wave with a typical velocity of a few 1000 km / s the ghost is compressed adiabatically and not shocked because of the much higher sound speed within it .",
    "therefore , diffusive shock acceleration is unlikely to be the prime mechanism that re - energises the relativistic electron population .",
    "however , it has been shown that the energy gained during the adiabatic compression , together with the increase in the magnetic fields strength , can cause the old radio cocoon to emit radio waves again .",
    "@xcite showed that the spectra thus produced are consistent with an old electron population that has been adiabatically compressed . with the aid of magneto - hydrodynamical simulations",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the resulting relics typically possess a toroidal shape and are partially polarised - in good agreement with observations .",
    "in this paper we attempt to predict the radio - luminosity function of cluster radio relics , in particular of radio relics that are produced via compression of old radio plasma .",
    "our predictions are intended to provide an order - of - magnitude estimate for the potential detection of diffuse radio sources by future high - sensitivity radio observatories , such as the low frequency array ( lofar ) and the square kilometer array .",
    "it is too early to aim for great precision in this calculation . here",
    ", we merely attempt to devise a simple and physically intuitive model which will give a first estimate of the luminosity function .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in the following section we explain conceptually our approach in calculating the radio relic luminosity function . in sec .",
    "iii we describe the cosmological simulations that provide the input for our calculations , which then are presented in detail in sec .",
    "finally , the results are presented and discussed in sec . v.",
    "the progenitors for radio relics are so - called radio ghosts , which are radio - quiet bubbles of non - thermal plasma released by formerly active radio galaxies . in the picture of relic formation considered here ,",
    "the ghost bubbles are re - energised by compression by large - scale shocks .",
    "consequently , for a calculation of the relic luminosity function , we have to determine the statistics of , both , the relevant properties of radio ghosts and of cosmic shock waves .    * radio ghosts : * + in order to calculate the statistics of radio ghosts , we start from the luminosity distribution of radio galaxies that form the progenitors of radio ghosts . in the next step ,",
    "the observed radio galaxy luminosity function needs to be translated into a birth rate of radio ghosts , and this is done by assuming a constant lifetime for the radio galaxy of @xmath1 yrs .",
    "this means that the radio cocoon is observable on average for @xmath2 yrs .",
    "this step is a coarse simplification since it ignores any intrinsic luminosity evolution during the observable lifetime of a radio galaxy @xcite .",
    "its justification lies partially in the fact that a more sophisticated treatment would require the introduction of several poorly constrained parameters , an expense which is not rewarded by the only moderate gain in accuracy .",
    "the observed radio luminosity function is dominated by the long - lasting late stage in the evolution of radio galaxies in which the radio luminosity is nearly constant .",
    "therefore , the approximation that each source only has a single luminosity during its lifetime is acceptable compared to other uncertainties .",
    "now , the luminosity of a radio ghost is boosted when it is compressed by a shock wave . whether this leads to an observable radio relic depends on a combination of shock strength and age of the radio ghost .",
    "the shock has to be strong enough to lead to a sufficient amplification of the magnetic field inside the ghost and to a sufficient increase of the energies of the most relativistic electrons . only a strong enough",
    "shock allows the renewed emission of synchrotron emission at observable frequencies .",
    "however , the maximal energy in the electron spectrum decreases with age owing to the unavoidable synchrotron and cmb inverse - compton energy losses .",
    "this implies that the radio ghost must not exceed a certain age , if it is to be re - activated by a shock wave of a given strength , and , therefore , we need to estimate the age distribution of radio ghosts .",
    "the birth rate of radio ghosts changes drastically during cosmological times , as we know from the strongly redshift - dependent radio luminosity function .",
    "however , on the timescale of @xmath3 yrs , over which radio ghosts are able to be re - activated by typical shock waves , the radio luminosity function is roughly constant",
    ". therefore , instead of modelling the demographic evolution of the ghost distribution , for simplicity we use a flat age distribution , even though @xcite do not fully confirm this approximation .",
    "this implies that the number of ghosts is given by    @xmath4    in the next step , the maximal age , within which a radio ghost can be re - activated , is calculated . because of the very low density inside the radio cocoon , inverse compton and synchrotron emission are the dominant processes whereby the electrons lose their energy .",
    "thus , the maximal lorentz factor of the relativistic electron population evolves according to    @xmath5    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the magnetic field and cmb energy densities respectively , and @xmath8 .",
    "this equation has the solution    @xmath9    for a period @xmath10 to @xmath11 with constant ambient conditions ( @xmath6 , @xmath12 const ) .",
    "a shock wave of mach number @xmath13 compresses radio plasma with a relativistic equation of state ( adiabatic index of @xmath14 ) by a factor    @xmath15    and thereby increases the maximum electron energy adiabatically to @xmath16 and the magnetic field energy density to @xmath17 , where the index @xmath18 and @xmath19 labels pre- and post - shock quantities respectively . for simplicity ,",
    "radiative energy losses during the short compression phase are neglected .",
    "the radio ghost can be regarded to be reactivated , and therefore to form a radio relic , if the characteristic synchrotron frequency of the most energetic electrons    @xmath20    is above the observing frequency @xmath21 .",
    "the relic remains visible for a period @xmath22 until ( the now enhanced ) radiative cooling according to eqs .",
    "[ eq : cool1 ] and [ eq : cool2 ] has moved the synchrotron cut - off frequency below @xmath21 .    clearly , in order to compute the synchrotron ageing , we need a description of the magnetic field strength inside the radio ghosts . here , we assume that the magnetic energy density is some fraction of the total pressure inside the ghost , which itself is in pressure equilibrium with the ambient pressure @xmath23 . hence , we need to specify the distribution of radio ghosts as a function of the ambient pressure , which we approximate as follows :    our starting point is the spatial statistics of the radio galaxy distribution , which we scale with some power @xmath24 of the ambient gas density @xmath25 .",
    "we assume that the radio galaxy distribution @xmath26 per luminosity and for a specific volume element at location @xmath27 can be written as a direct product of its global luminosity function @xmath28 and a term proportional to @xmath29 ( for a discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "this allows us to construct the radio luminosity function as the number of radio galaxies of luminosity @xmath30 per unit volume @xmath31 , pressure @xmath23 and luminosity as a function of @xmath23 , @xmath32 and redshift @xmath33    @xmath34    one can get a handle on @xmath24 by demanding that @xmath35 % - 50 % of all radio galaxies lie in clusters @xcite .",
    "if we characterise clusters by means of their pressures , i.e. as environments where the pressure lies above @xmath36 erg @xmath37 , we find that for @xmath24 of around 1.5 about 30 % of radiogalaxies should lie in clusters and for @xmath38 about 60 % would lie in clusters .",
    "one should note , however , that these estimates are very crude and should be treated with caution .",
    "so in the following , we will present our results for these two values of @xmath24 .",
    "the distribution function @xmath39 is defined via    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the delta function and @xmath42 is a normalisation constant chosen such that @xmath43 .    as explained in more detail later ,",
    "@xmath39 is extracted from a simulation of cosmological structure formation .",
    "now we can also express the birth rate of radio _ ghosts _ per unit @xmath23 , @xmath32 and @xmath31    @xmath44    * shock waves : * + when the radio ghost is compressed adiabatically , its synchrotron luminosity , @xmath45 , increases with respect to its initial luminosity , @xmath46 , by a factor @xmath47^{5/2}$ ] @xcite .",
    "this treatment ignores subtle spectral steepening effects that occur when the spectral cut - off passes the observing frequency with a spectral index @xmath48 @xmath49 is described by @xmath50 which shows a spectral steepening shortly below the cutoff for @xmath51 . ] , and the detailed shape of the synchrotron emission spectral kernel .",
    "however , our simplified treatment should be entirely sufficient for our purposes .",
    "finally , we need to determine the frequency with which shock waves of a given mach number @xmath13 sweep over a radio ghost , which is situated at redshift @xmath33 in an environment of pressure @xmath23 .",
    "this frequency is written as    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the flow of @xmath29 ( a density - biased mass flow ) integrated over shocks of mach number @xmath13 , at redshift @xmath33 and in an environment of pressure @xmath23 , given by    @xmath54    where @xmath31 is the volume considered , @xmath55 the sound speed , @xmath56 the shock velocity and @xmath57 the adiabatic index of the gas .",
    "note that @xmath58 and @xmath55 are evaluated ahead of the shock .",
    "it is useful to define the time between successive shocks of any strength , which is given by    @xmath59^{-1}. \\label{tau}\\ ] ]    from the simulations that will be described in the following section , this time was inferred to be of the order of 3 hubble times , which is roughly consistent with the findings by @xcite , who claim that about 30 % of the baryons in the universe at redshift zero have been shocked .",
    "we also find that @xmath60 increases with pressure which is attributed to the fact that there are many more low - pressure regions in the universe and that these regions have lower sound speeds and shock more easily .",
    "the formation and evolution of the large - scale structure is computed by means of an eulerian , grid based total - variation - diminishing hydro+n - body code @xcite .",
    "we adopt a canonical , flat @xmath61cdm cosmological model with a total mass density @xmath62 and a vacuum energy density @xmath63 .",
    "we assume a normalized hubble constant @xmath64 km s@xmath65 mpc@xmath65 = 0.67 and a baryonic mass density , @xmath66 .",
    "the simulation is started at redshift @xmath67 with initial density perturbations generated as a gaussian random field and characterized by a power spectrum with a spectral index @xmath68 and `` cluster - normalization '' @xmath69 .",
    "we adopt a computational box size of @xmath70mpc . in this box the dark matter component is described by 256@xmath71 particles whereas the gas component is evolved on a comoving grid of 512@xmath71 zones .",
    "thus each numerical cell measures about @xmath72kpc ( comoving ) and each dark matter particle corresponds to @xmath73 .",
    "further details on the cosmological simulations can be found in @xcite .",
    "the results from the simulation are used to build the distribution functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 that are required in our calculations . as in previous studies",
    "@xcite , we identify shocks as converging flows ( @xmath76 ) that experience a pressure jump @xmath77 above a threshold corresponding to a mach number m=1.5 . once a shock has been identified the jump conditions are evaluated from the numerical solution .",
    "finally , the shock speed and mach number are computed @xcite .",
    "in this section we carry out the calculations that were outlined in prose in the previous sections . the total number of radio _ relics _ of luminosity @xmath45 per unit volume at a given redshift is given by the birth rate of radio _ ghosts _",
    ", @xmath78 , times the time for which the radio relic is visible , @xmath22 , times the frequency of shocks of given strength , @xmath79 that can boost their luminosity from @xmath46 to @xmath45 .",
    "all this is integrated over the luminosity of the _ ghosts _ , @xmath46 , the age of the _ ghost _ at the time of compression , @xmath80 , and pressure and mach number , i.e.    @xmath81 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath60 is given by eq.([tau ] ) and @xmath82 the time for which the relic is visible , i.e. , until the cut - off frequency falls below the observing frequency .",
    "this time is calculated below .",
    "note that we have introduced a factor of @xmath83 which ensures that a radio ghost can only be reactivated once .",
    "we can perform the integration with respect to @xmath46 , by assuming that , upon compression , the luminosity of the radio ghosts increases by    @xmath84    where @xmath45 and @xmath46 and @xmath85 and @xmath86 refer to the post-/pre - shock luminosities and pressures , respectively .",
    "moreover , in concordance with observations , a spectral index of 1 for the synchrotron emission was assumed @xcite .",
    "note that we make the simplifying assumption that the ghost instantaneously flares up to @xmath45 as the shock sweeps by . performing the @xmath46-integration",
    ", we obtain    @xmath87    the visibility time @xmath22 is calculated as follows : the cut - off frequency , @xmath88 , decreases due to synchrotron radiation and compton scattering with the cmb photons .",
    "furthermore , the compression of the radio ghost after a time @xmath80 boosts the cut - off frequency by a factor of @xmath89 .",

    "here , we assumed that the magnetic energy density is some fraction of the total pressure in the ghost @xmath96 .    solving for @xmath22 yields :    @xmath97/(\\epsilon_{b_2 } + \\epsilon_{\\rm cmb } ) \\ .\\ ] ]    now we calculate the last integral in eq .",

    "as indicated in the plot the number density of relics goes down with increasing redshift .",
    "the number of relics per decade in brightness at 150 mhz as a function of flux is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] for @xmath120 and 2 , respectively .",
    "their distribution roughly follows a power law of index -0.6 . for higher values of @xmath24",
    "the number of relics decreases because , for higher @xmath24 , a larger fraction of radio ghosts is concentrated in the cores of clusters , where the lifetime of the radio ghosts is shorter and the chances for a reappearance as a radio relics diminish .",
    "the number of radio relics at 151 mhz is higher than the number of _ radio halos _ at 1.4 ghz by a factor of @xmath121 as predicted by @xcite . assuming a spectral index of 1 , as we did in this paper",
    ", this would imply that the numbers of radio relics and halos should roughly match if compared at the same frequency , which is what is indeed found . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we have included a histogram with the observed flux density distribution of the sample of feretti ( 1999 ) .",
    "even though the current sample of radio relics is still poor , we find that current observations are not inconsistent with our predictions .",
    "ignoring the uncertainties of our model , one would conclude from figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] that , in the range between 1 and 10 jansky , approximately 10 % of the radio relics have been detected .",
    "however , we fear that the predicted number may be a bit high and that we have overestimated the luminosities due to two reasons : first , we neglected the enhanced cooling during the compression of the bubble and , second , the majority of radio cocoons will not be in exact pressure equilibrium but are more likely to be still somewhat overpressured when they are being compressed .",
    "these two effects will shift the curves to the left while leaving the slope unchanged .    in order to determine in which environments the majority of relics",
    "is to be found , we computed the contribution to the total flux density from relics that lie within a certain pressure range ( since pressure is the free variable in our formalism ) .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] corresponds to the total number of relics , while the dashed line includes only the contribution from relics that are found at pressures @xmath122 g @xmath37 , the dotted line to those at @xmath123 g @xmath37 , and the dot - dashed line only those at @xmath124 g @xmath37 .",
    "we find that the majority of radio relics is found at pressures between a bit below @xmath125 g @xmath37 and @xmath126 g @xmath37 , which are typical values for pressures at the edges of galaxy cluster .",
    "this is in good agreement with the observed locations of radio relics : nearly all of them have been found in the periphery of galaxy clusters .",
    "however , similar pressure conditions are also encountered around groups and in filaments of galaxies , where we would also expect that future high - sensitivity observations detect radio relics .",
    "conversely , in the cores of clusters , i.e. at typical pressures of @xmath127 g @xmath37 , only @xmath128 1% of radio relics are expected ( see dot - dashed line ) . the fact , that shocks become stronger when they leave the cluster , more than makes up for the fact that there are fewer radio galaxies in the outer regions . moreover ,",
    "radio plasma is very short - lived at high ambient pressures because the synchrotron losses are high .",
    "thus , even though there is more radio plasma in the cores of clusters , only little of it is fresh enough to form radio relics again . here",
    "we predict that radio relics are predominantly found in low - pressure regions outside the cores of clusters .",
    "using very simple assumptions we were able to give a first gross estimate of the number of radio relics that are expected at different flux limits . upcoming low - frequency radio telescopes such as lofar",
    "are ideally suited to search for relics at the edges of clusters .",
    "lofar is expected to have a point source sensitivity of 0.13 mjy at 120 mhz within one hour of integration time and a 4 mhz bandwidth .",
    "a survey covering half the sky can be accomplished in a years timescale at this frequency and with this depth @xcite .",
    "such a survey is likely to find of the order of @xmath129 radio relics . as mentioned earlier , we believe that this number may be a bit too high because the number of detected relics between 1 and 10 jansky is lower by a factor of roughly 10 .",
    "however , given the simplicity of our model and the scarceness of data , this is not a bad match . more importantly , while the normalisation of the brightness distribution is sensitive to some of our assumptions and , consequently , somewhat uncertain , both , the slope of the distribution and the relative contributions from different pressure bins are fairly robust predictions .",
