    "<S> the ss peak becomes elongated on pseudorapidity @xmath1 and the transverse momentum @xmath2 structure is modified . in the latter case the ss 2d peak has been referred to as a `` soft ridge , '' and arguments have been presented that the elongated peak represents flow phenomena ( `` triangular '' and `` higher harmonic '' flows ) , possibly related to the initial - state geometry . in this presentation </S>",
    "<S> i demonstrate that `` higher harmonic flows '' are related to ss 2d peak properties and review evidence for a jet interpretation of the ss peak for all centralities . </S>"
