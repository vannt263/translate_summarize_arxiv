    "we apologize for this inconvenience , but luckily the indexation by second chern class stays the same .",
    "indeed , if @xmath21 has degree @xmath0 then @xmath22 as can be seen for example on the bundle @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the moduli space of stable bundles @xmath3 we look at here is isomorphic to @xmath25 considered in @xcite . ] with determinant @xmath26 such that @xmath27 .",
    "the moduli space of stable bundles in general has been the subject of much work @xcite , but the special case @xmath11 considered here goes into a somewhat new and uncharted territory .",

    "we will be assuming that @xmath21 is general in some irreducible component of the moduli space . from the previous paper @xcite using some techniques for bounding the singular locus which had also been introduced in @xcite and @xcite , it follows that @xmath21 is unobstructed , so if @xmath35 denotes the trace - free part of @xmath36 then @xmath37 .",

    "duality says that @xmath49 is dual to @xmath50 . since @xmath51 , if we set @xmath52 then @xmath53 .",
    "in particular there are at least @xmath54 linearly independent sections of @xmath55 which may be viewed as maps @xmath56 or equivalently @xmath57 .",
    "note that the zero set of @xmath58 has to be of codimension @xmath4 , as any codimension - one component would be a divisor integer multiple of the hyperplane class but @xmath59 so this ca nt happen .",

    "it is a union of possibly nonreduced points , which are locally complete intersections i.e.   defined by two equations .",
    "furthermore , as is classically well - known @xcite @xcite , @xmath63 satisfies the cayley - bacharach condition for @xmath66 which we denote by @xmath67 , saying that any subscheme @xmath68 of colength @xmath0 imposes the same number of conditions as @xmath63 on sections of @xmath66 .",

    "then the extension class is well - defined up to a scalar multiple which does nt affect the isomorphism class of @xmath21 , and the existence of the nonzero class in @xmath76 is expected to impose @xmath77 conditions on the @xmath43 points , giving the expected dimension of the hilbert scheme of such subschemes @xmath78 to be @xmath79 . in section [ seminatural ] , we will show @xmath80 and in that case the bundle @xmath21 has seminatural cohomology .",

    "we consider the @xmath541-dimensional component of the singular locus whose general point is a bundle @xmath21 fitting into an exact sequence @xmath830 where @xmath831 is a general collection of @xmath535 points on @xmath832 for a quadric @xmath588 .    for a general such bundle @xmath21 , there is a unique co - obstruction , which is to say a unique exact sequence as above , and the zariski normal space to the singular locus may naturally be identified with @xmath833 which has dimension @xmath4 .",
    "the second order obstruction map is the same as the quadratic form associated to the symmetric bilinear form obtained from duality @xmath834 .",
    "this quadratic form defines a pair of lines inside @xmath833 .",
    "these are the two actual normal directions of the moduli space of bundles along the singular locus at @xmath21 . in order to show that this component of the singular locus meets a canonically defined irreducible component of the moduli space",
    ", it suffices to show that these two lines are interchanged as @xmath835 moves about in the hilbert scheme of @xmath535-tuples of points in @xmath108 .",
    "the @xmath4-dimensional space @xmath833 together with its quadratic form , depend only on the arrangement @xmath836 of @xmath535 points on a quadric @xmath837 , in a way we now explain .",
    "the homogeneous coordinates of the @xmath535 points give a map @xmath838 .",
    "we get a map @xmath839 , and the equation of the quadric @xmath588 is an element of the kernel ; as @xmath840 has dimension @xmath535 itself , there is an element @xmath841 in the cokernel , unique up to scalars .",
    "the @xmath471 condition , which holds for general @xmath835 , corresponds to asking that @xmath842 for all @xmath843 .",
    "therefore @xmath844 defines a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form on @xmath845 denoted @xmath846 the condition that @xmath844 vanish on the image of @xmath840 says that @xmath847 is an isotropic subspace . in other words , it is contained in its orthogonal subspace @xmath848 .",
    "the quotient @xmath849 is our two - dimensional space @xmath833 and @xmath850 induces a quadratic form on here .",
    "we are interested in the two isotropic lines .",
    "fix @xmath583 of the points in a general way ; then our two dimensional subspace with quadratic form , depends on a single choice of @xmath851 .",
    "a calculation shows that the discriminant divisor of the quadratic form contains reduced components in @xmath588 .",
    "so if one has a curve of points @xmath852 which intersect this divisor transversally , the two lines are interchanged when we go around the intersection point on the curve .",
    "now , one can choose @xmath19 to pass through the given @xmath853 as well as transversally through a general reduced point on the discriminant divisor .",
    "for such @xmath19 , the tangent directions are interchanged as @xmath835 moves around in @xmath832 , so the same is also true for any general @xmath19 .",
    "this completes the construction of a specified irreducible component of the moduli space of bundles .",
    "notice that for the singular points @xmath21 constructed above , we still have @xmath163 , so a soon as we move off the singular locus to get @xmath48 , this gives a bundle with seminatural cohomology .",
    "thus , our specified irreducible component corresponds to bundles with seminatural cohomology .",
    "now , hirschowitz s argument plus theorem [ only ] saying that the hilbert scheme of choices @xmath820 is irreducible , combine to show that there is only one irreducible component in the moduli space of stable bundles on @xmath19 of degree @xmath0 and @xmath1 having seminatural cohomology .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem [ main ] .",
    "we indicate here how one should be able to treat conjecture [ all ] .",
    "notice that we made the hypothesis that @xmath163 , and this implied seminatural cohomology .",
    "so , in the non - seminatural case we have @xmath854 , and @xmath184 . if @xmath855 with subscheme of zeros @xmath63 then @xmath856 .    the first step will be to show that sections of @xmath55 have a base locus consisting of at most one point @xmath350 , and that a general @xmath63 has to be reduced at @xmath467 , with @xmath541 points making up @xmath101 with doubly - transitive galois action .",
    "this should be similar to our arguments of sections [ baseloci ] and [ pstructure ] .",
    "one can also point out , right away , that this allows us to rule out the `` common curve case '' as in section [ sec - ccc ] , indeed even in the case when @xmath662 has degree @xmath110 , the same argument as we used for degrees @xmath522 and @xmath497 works to show that @xmath662 would have to be contained in a quadric .",
    "so , we are in the variable curve case . if @xmath575 is a complete intersection of two cubics passing through @xmath63 , then @xmath597 with @xmath577 irreducible , containing @xmath101 in its smooth locus .",
    "part of the argument consisted of ruling out @xmath857 by a dimension count .",
    "here we ca nt just transpose the arguments , indeed the dimension of the hilbert scheme of possible collections @xmath63 might be strictly smaller than @xmath79 , because each @xmath63 can contribute a positive dimensional space of extension classes .",
    "so we should divide the argument into two cases .",
    "if @xmath858 , i.e.   @xmath75 in the notations of section [ notations ] , then the dimension of @xmath859 is @xmath0 and the extension class is unique up to scalars . in this case , the dimension of the hilbert scheme @xmath820 remains @xmath79 ( and including the complete intersection curve @xmath575 gives @xmath819 of dimension @xmath443 ) .",
    "the dimension count may then proceed as we have done and this should allow us to treat this case .    in the case when @xmath860 , each choice of @xmath63 corresponds to a positive dimensional space of choices of extension class up to scalars .",
    "however , in this case we can degenerate the extension class to one which no longer satisfies the cayley - bachrach condition  meaning that , viewed as a dual element to @xmath861 , it vanishes on one or more points .",
    "the doubly transitive galois action on @xmath63 implies that the images of the points @xmath63 in the projective space of extension classes , can not generically bunch up in groups of more than one .",
    "therefore , it is possible to degenerate the extension class towards one which vanishes at exactly one point of @xmath63 .",
    "this means an extension which corresponds to a torsion - free sheaf @xmath21 with a singularity at a single point .",
    "it therefore corresponds to a point in the boundary of the moduli space , at the boundary component coming from @xmath862 .",
    "this boundary piece has codimension @xmath0 and we should be able to analyze the nearby bundles and conclude that we remain in the principal irreducible component ( indeed it suffices to say that nearby bundles have seminatural cohomology ) .",
    "the technique of localizing our picture on the boundary of the moduli space is obviously a necessary and important one which needs to be further developed in order to treat this type of question .",
    "this will be left for a future work .",
    "another interesting direction will be to look at reider s theory of nonabelian jacobians @xcite @xcite for bundles on a general quintic surface .",
    "the structures we have encountered in an _ ad hoc _ way in the course of our proof , are actually pieces of reider s theory ."

    "<S> [ all ] the moduli space @xmath11 is irreducible .    </S>",
    "<S> we havent yet formulated an opinion about the cases @xmath12 .    in the present paper , due to lack of time and for length reasons , </S>",
    "<S> we treat a special case of the conjecture : the case of bundles with _ </S>",

    "<S> the main result of this paper is :    [ main ] the moduli space @xmath17 is irreducible .    </S>",
    "<S> recall from @xcite that our inspiration to look at this question came from the recent results of yoshioka , for the case of calabi - yau surfaces originating in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> yoshioka shows that the moduli spaces are irreducible for all positive values of @xmath5 , when @xmath19 is an abelian or k3 surface @xcite @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> his results apply for example when @xmath19 is a general quartic hypersurface . </S>",
    "<S> we thought it was a natural question to look at the case of a quintic hypersurface , which is one of the first cases where @xmath19 has general type , with @xmath20 being as small as possible .    </S>",
    "<S> _ remark on the difficulty of this project : _ we were somewhat surprised by the diversity of techniques needed to treat this question . </S>",
    "<S> much of the difficulty stems from the possibilities of overdetermined intersections which need to be ruled out at various places in the argument . </S>",
    "<S> this question is inherently very delicate , because there is not , to our knowledge , any general principle which would say whether the moduli space is `` supposed to be '' irreducible or not . on the one hand , </S>",
    "<S> the present case is close to the abelian or k3 case , so it is nt too surprising if the moduli space remains irreducible ; however on the other hand , at some point new irreducible components will be appearing as has been shown by the first author in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so , we are led to analyse a number of cases for various aspects of the argument . </S>",
    "<S> if any case is mistakenly ignored , it might hide a new irreducible component which would then be missed .    </S>",
    "<S> a natural question to wonder about is whether `` derived algebraic geometry '' could help here , but it would seem that those techniques need to be further developed in order to apply to some basic geometric situations such as we see here . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , each place in the argument where some case is ruled out , constitutes a possible reason for there to be additional irreducible components in more complicated situations ( such as on a sextic hypersurface ) . </S>",
    "<S> so , in addition to the theorem itself which only goes a little way into the range that remains to be treated , much of the interest lies in the geometric situations which are encountered along the way . </S>"
