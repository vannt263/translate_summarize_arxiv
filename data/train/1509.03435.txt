    "despite the fact that self - organization of a system in an out - of - equilibrium state plays a crucial role in dynamical structural formation in nature , physical principles behind such phenomena have remained elusive .",
    "active matter @xcite and driven granular matter @xcite are two important classes of out - of - equilibrium systems .",
    "they share an intrinsic out - of - equilibrium nature , and the only basic difference is that the energy is injected locally for the active systems whereas globally for the granular systems @xcite .",
    "this global nature of energy input makes granular matter physically simpler than active matter .",
    "thus , granular matter is not only important for its own sake , but also regarded as a model for understanding the physics of active matter .",
    "granular matter is an important class of materials , distinct from thermal systems since the thermal energy is negligible for its description .",
    "granular matter is ubiquitous in nature and its dynamical self - organization always takes place in a strongly non - equilibrium situation as in active matter , since energy input is essential for its occurrence @xcite .",
    "its statistical yet athermal nature makes the physical description extremely difficult . from an experimental point of view",
    ", the control of self - organization of granular matter is also a difficult task .",
    "however , a notable exception is a dynamic steady state , maintained by the balance between energy input and dissipation , which allows us to perform well - controlled experiments .",
    "the most idealized system may be a quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) driven granular particle monolayer , where spherical particles are confined between two parallel plates whose gap is narrow enough to avoid particle overlap along the vertical direction and energy is injected by vertically vibrating plates .",
    "this system allows us to access all phase - space information at the particle level .",
    "so the phase behavior of such a monolayer particle system has played a crucial role in our understanding of the fundamental nature of self - organization in a system far from equilibrium .",
    "this vibrated monolayer particle system has also attracted considerable attention for its connections with fundamental problems in the field of condensed matter and statistical physics @xcite . the liquid - solid transition in a 2d disk system , the thermodynamic counterpart of a vibrated monolayer , has been a hot topic since the discovery of the liquid - solid transition for hard disks by alder and wainwright @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional particle systems can not crystallize at finite temperature due to significant fluctuation effects associated with the low dimensionality , yet the above work shows that they may still form solids .",
    "there is a long - standing debate @xcite on the nature of this transition for a system of the simplest interparticle interaction , hard disks .",
    "one scenario is that ordering takes place via two steps , liquid - to - hexatic and hexatic - to - solid transitions , now widely known as the kosterlitz - thouless - halperin - nelson - young ( kthny ) scenario @xcite .",
    "here each transition is continuous .",
    "the other is that ordering takes place in one step via a first - order liquid - solid transition @xcite .",
    "there have been hot debates on which is the relevant scenario .",
    "very recently , it was shown @xcite that the transition actually takes place by a scenario different from both of them : it occurs with two steps as the kthny scenario suggests , but the first transition is not continuous but weakly discontinuous .",
    "however , the first - order nature of the liquid - hexatic transition is very weak , and the transition roughly obeys the kthny scenario .",
    "this basic behavior is common to other systems including particles interacting with soft repulsive potentials @xcite and those with attractive potentials such as the lennard - jones potential @xcite , although it has recently be shown that the nature of the transitions depends on the softness of the potential in a delicate manner @xcite .",
    "monolayer granular matter has provided a model experimental system to study this fundamental problem .",
    "some time ago , careful experiments were made on the athermal counterpart of the above system .",
    "it was shown by shattuck and his coworkers that a driven monolayer particle system continuously transforms from a liquid to an intermediate hexatic , and then to a solid phase , with an increase in the particle area fraction @xmath0 under a constant @xmath1 @xcite ( see sec .",
    "ii for the precise definitions of @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) .",
    "a similar meting transition behavior was also observed by olasfen and urbach when increasing the dimensionless acceleration @xmath1 at a fixed particle area fraction @xmath0 for a granular quasi - monolayer @xcite .",
    "however , it was shown that the thickness of the cell @xmath2 , which is 1.6 times of the particle diameter @xmath3 , plays a crucial role in the transition : height fluctuations of particles may be a source of disorder .",
    "the increase of their amplitude with an increase in the vibration amplitude , or @xmath1 , increases the number density of defects , eventually leading to the melting of the solid phase .",
    "thus , the mechanism may be essentially different from the former example , which does not involve any significant hight fluctuations due to a strong 2d confinement .",
    "the former liquid - solid transition behavior as a function of @xmath0 @xcite obeys the kthny scenario @xcite , although the liquid - to - hexatic transition may be weakly first - order @xcite .",
    "this study suggests that a quasi-2d driven granular system behaves very similarly to its thermal counterpart .",
    "a similar conclusion was also derived for glass - transition - like phenomena of driven binary mixtures @xcite and polydisperse systems @xcite .",
    "the energy injected by mechanical vibration is converted to the kinetic energy of a system and the effective ( granular ) temperature @xmath4 is defined by this kinetic energy .",
    "if this is high enough to overcome the gravity and the energy loss originating from the friction and inelastic collisions with the container @xcite , we may approximately regard the system as a thermal equilibrium system as long as interparticle collisions are almost elastic .",
    "however , the exact mechanism responsible for this apparent thermal behavior of an athermal system has remained elusive .",
    "we note that these experiments were performed by using rather elastic balls such as steel balls .",
    "then , the natural question to ask next is how the nature of the liquid - solid transition is affected by the inelasticity of collisions , or internal dissipation .",
    "there were pioneering works on liquid - solid transitions of quasi-2d granular systems @xcite .",
    "these studies showed interesting monolayer liquid - bilayer solid coexistence in a nonequilibrium steady state , in which the two phases have different granular temperatures .",
    "these are intriguing examples of phase ordering , more generally self - organization , in a dynamic steady state of a non - equilibrium open system , maintained by the balance between energy input and dissipation .    here",
    "we study the effect of energy dissipation on liquid - solid transition of a quasi-2d driven granular matter by comparing the behaviors of steel and rubber ball systems .",
    "we note that steel and rubber balls have differences in the restitution coefficient , the friction coefficient , and the elastic properties . among these",
    ", the difference in elastic properties may be less important compared to the others because forces acting upon interparticle collisions are too weak to cause non - linear deformation of the balls and it is known that the 2d melting behavior is not affected by the softness of the interaction potential @xcite .",
    "a situation we consider is a _ single _ layer of monodisperse spheres , which is vibrated between two horizontal plates @xcite , unlike the above - mentioned previous works where bilayer formation is allowed @xcite .",
    "the control parameters in our experiments are the energy input characterized by a dimensionless acceleration @xmath1 and the area fraction of particles @xmath0 . here",
    "we demonstrate that the dissipation due to the inelasticity of collisions and the friction can , if they are strong enough , completely break the similarity between the athermal and the corresponding thermal system and fundamentally change the nature of the liquid - solid transition _ in a monolayer _ from the kthny - like continuous transitional behavior @xcite to a strongly discontinuous transition .",
    "we discuss a physical mechanism responsible for this unconventional self - organization under energy dissipation .",
    "our study reveals a novel mechanism leading to the coexistence of two phases with different granular temperatures , which is essentially different from the mechanism previously found @xcite .",
    "we infer that a similar mechanism may be relevant to self - organization of active matter including living systems .",
    "dissipative interactions , such as inelastic , hydrodynamic , frictional interactions , may play a crucial role in the state selection .",
    "our experimental apparatus is analogous to those used in @xcite and the same as that used in @xcite .",
    "a monolayer of non - cohesive particles was vibrated sinusoidally in the vertical direction by an electromagnetic shaker ( labworks et-139 ) with frequency @xmath5 .",
    "we changed the dimensionless acceleration @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the amplitude of vibration and @xmath8 is the gravitational acceleration , by controlling @xmath7 .",
    "the cell has a circular shape and its inner diameter is @xmath9 .",
    "the circular annulus made of duralumin is used as the hard side wall .",
    "when we make an experiment with a soft side wall ( see sec .",
    "ii.d ) , the inner side wall of the annulus is covered by a silicone rubber sheet of 0.2 mm thickness . in our experiments",
    ", we use two types of spherical particles : steel and fluorine - rubber balls .",
    "the particle diameter is @xmath10 for both stainless steel and fluorine - rubber ball .",
    "the fluorine - rubber ball has four important characteristics : ( i ) a non - cohesive character , ( ii ) a large stiffness ( @xmath11 gpa ) , which allows us to ignore nonlinear deformation upon collision , ( iii ) a low dynamic friction coefficient ( @xmath12 ) , and ( iv ) a low restitution coefficient . the friction coefficient of the fluorine rubber may be comparable to that of the steel . however , the coefficient of rolling friction may be smaller for the steel ball than for the rubber ball since the former has a smoother surface than the latter .",
    "the restitution coefficient @xmath13 is difficult to estimate accurately and it is known to depend on the particle velocity .",
    "here we measured the height ratio before and after a collision with a steel wall by dropping a ball vertically .",
    "the restitution coefficient @xmath13 against a steel wall was estimated as @xmath14 and @xmath15 with the variance of 0.1 for the steel and rubber ball respectively .",
    "we also estimated the @xmath13 for collision between two rubber balls as @xmath16 .",
    "the value of @xmath13 for steel balls coincides well with the literature value @xcite . by confining these particles between two plates separated by an annulus with a thickness @xmath2 of 4.0 mm ( i.e. , @xmath17 ) , we allowed only quasi-2d particle motion , i.e , no bilayer formation .",
    "we note that in previous similar works on the liquid - solid transition of driven granular matter @xcite @xmath18 , which allows particles to form bilayers ( see appendix a-1 ) .",
    "this difference in @xmath19 leads to a crucial difference in the nature of a liquid - solid transition between our system and theirs , as will be discussed later .",
    "the top plate is a transparent glass plate so that we can observe the particles through it .",
    "the bottom duralumin plate is covered with a sandpaper by which the vertically oscillating particles are scattered @xcite .",
    "the use of a wall with surface roughness is expected to randomize the horizontal motion and realize brownian - like motion of particles .",
    "it was shown @xcite that a large enough @xmath1 leads to the velocity distribution function of a nearly gaussian shape for a driven monolayer system .",
    "this is because the randomization of the energy injection due to particle collisions and the wall roughness leads to realization of a self - generated effective white bath in a long timescale .    for steel balls",
    ", we obtained the particle coordinates by tracking the bright spots at the top of particles reflecting illuminating light . for rubber balls , on the other hand , we obtain the particle coordinates simply by binarisation of particle images .",
    "we used a high speed camera ( vcc - h500 , digimo co. ltd . ) .",
    "the typical frame rate used was 100 frame / s and the image resolution was 640@xmath20480 .",
    "occasionally , we used the rate of 500 frame / s with a resolution of 640@xmath2090 .",
    "a pixel size corresponds to 0.25 mm .",
    "the position of each particle was tracked by a particle tracking software , which fits a gaussian function to an image of each particle .",
    "the detection error is less than 0.05 mm for a steel ball and 0.1 mm for a rubber ball .",
    "we measured a structure after attaining a steady state ( typically after 10 min from the initiation of vibrational driving ) .    in our system ,",
    "the transition between a solid - like and liquid - like state occurs as a function of the area fraction @xmath21 , where @xmath3 is the diameter of particle , @xmath9 is the inner diameter of the annulus , @xmath22 is the total number of particles in the system .",
    "we note that this definition of @xmath0 is often used in describing the phase transition of ( quasi-)2d hard particle systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the random close packing and the closest packing in 2d occur at about 0.83 and 0.906 respectively .",
    "because of the rather small size of our system , our measurements may suffer from finite - size effects .",
    "the effects may not be so serious for a discontinuous liquid - solid transition in a rubber ball system , since there is no diverging lengthscale .",
    "on the other hand , the results of a steel ball system may suffer from finite - size effects .",
    "however , the maximum correlation length we could attain was 9 times the particle diameter @xmath3 , which is still much shorter than the cell diameter ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "so the finite size effects may not be so severe for our results , although there might be slight shifts in the transition area fractions .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the rather good agreement of the measured @xmath0-dependences of the correlation length of hexatic order @xmath24 and translational order @xmath25 with the theoretical predictions for an infinite system ( see below ) .",
    "however , the correlation lengths , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , may be bound by the cell size very near the hexatic ordering point @xmath26 and the solidification point @xmath27 , respectively , and the weak discontinuous nature of a liquid - hexatic transition may be smeared out by the finite - size effects @xcite . in principle",
    ", we can use a cell with a larger diameter , but what is most important in our measurements is the homogeneity of the vertical vibration amplitude .",
    "so we used only the rather small cell .",
    "we are planning to make a large cell with high mechanical rigidity , but we leave this for future investigation .      the 2d radial distribution function @xmath28 was calculated as @xmath29 which is the ratio of the ensemble average of the number density of particles existing in the region @xmath30 to the average number density @xmath31 . here @xmath22 is the number of particles in the simulation box , whose side length is @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the increment of @xmath34 .",
    "the spatial correlation of translational order is characterized by the translational correlation length @xmath25 for @xmath35 as follows : @xmath36 where @xmath37 expresses an operation to extract the envelop function of the positive part of a function @xmath38 .",
    "the hexatic order parameter is measured by @xmath39 for each particle @xmath40 , where the sum runs over the @xmath41 nearest - neighbors of particle @xmath40 , and @xmath42 is the angle between the bond @xmath43 and a fixed arbitrary axis . here",
    "the nearest - neighbor particles are detected by a criterion @xmath44 .",
    "we confirmed that this criterion provides the same nearest - neighbor identification as a method based on voronoi tessellation .",
    "then , the spatial correlation of @xmath45 is calculated as @xcite @xmath46 the spatial correlation of the bond - orientational order can then be characterized by @xmath47 . here",
    "the division by @xmath28 is to remove the effect of translational ordering .    to characterize the fluctuations of @xmath48",
    ", we estimate the spatial correlation length of @xmath48 , @xmath24 , and the susceptibility , @xmath49 .",
    "we obtain the spatial correlation length @xmath24 for @xmath50 from the following relation : @xmath51",
    "now we show experimental data which provide information on the nature of the phase transitions . for driven steel balls , it was previously shown that the system transforms from the liquid to solid via the intermediate hexatic phase @xcite .",
    "for comparing the behavior of steel and rubber ball systems on the same ground we performed experiments for the two systems under the same experimental conditions .    before showing results , we briefly review how the spatial correlations of the positional and bond orientational order parameter are predicted to grow with an increase in the area fraction @xmath0 in the framework of the kthny theory @xcite .",
    "the predicted behaviors are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : kthny ] . the hexatic ordering point @xmath52 and the crystallization point @xmath53",

    "the slight differences of the transition area fractions from those of a hard disk system @xcite may be due to the quasi-2d nature of a system and finite size effects .    as examples of our analysis , here",

    ", we see a crossover from inhomogeneous excitation to homogeneous one , but this transition as a function of @xmath1 has an origin essentially different from the transition as a function of @xmath0 ( see appendix a-2 and b for the details ) .",
    "the above - mentioned fundamental differences between our work and the previous studies strongly indicate that the underlying physics is essentially different between the two cases even on a qualitative level . in appendix a-3",
    ", we also mention another type of inhomogeneization in driven inelastic particles , gas - liquid coexistence @xcite .",
    "finally , we mention the 2d melting of a solid phase with an increase in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "as described in the introduction , this melting is induced by the increase in the defect density , which is caused by the increase in hight fluctuations of particles .",
    "since our 2d constraint @xmath104 is much stronger than the one used in this work ( @xmath105 ) , we did not see any indication of @xmath1-induced melting .",
    "it is interesting to study in the future how and at which @xmath19 the behavior changes .",
    "first we qualitatively consider what is the origin of the difference in the phase - transition behavior between the steel and rubber ball systems .",
    "steel and rubber balls differ not only in the inelasticity and friction upon interparticle collisions but also in the softness of interparticle interactions .",
    "it is rather well established that the kthny - like behavior , or a transition from liquid to solid via the intermediate hexatic phase , is very robust for 2d ` thermal ' systems , irrespective of the types of interparticle interactions : essentially the same behavior was observed not only for hard disks but also for particles interacting with soft repulsive potentials and attractive ( e.g. , lennard - jones ) potentials ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , although it has recently been shown that the liquid - hexatic transition depends delicately on the softness of the interaction @xcite .",
    "this robustness of the kthny - like behavior irrespective of the nature of interactions is a natural consequence of the fact that hexatic order is formed primarily by geometrical packing effects : when hard - sphere - like particles are packed , this local configuration is entropically favored .",
    "this suggests that the nature of the liquid - solid transition between the steel and rubber ball systems is not controlled by the softness of particles , but by the dissipation due to the inelasticity of particles and the friction .",
    "now we consider how inelasticity and friction can change the nature of the liquid - solid transition .",
    "steel balls are not perfectly elastic but the system still behaves like a thermal system . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior of the rubber ball system is distinctly different from the behavior of its thermal counterpart .",
    "so the question can be rephrased as what physical mechanism controls the transition from apparently thermal to athermal behavior when we change the degree of inelasticity and friction from steel to rubber balls . for a vertically vibrated monolayer system , the particle-(top and bottom ) wall collision frequency , @xmath106 ,",
    "is higher than the particle - particle collision frequency , @xmath107 , as long as @xmath108 .",
    "we estimated @xmath106 as roughly 100 hz by illuminating light from a low angle from the horizontal plane and @xmath107 as roughly 20 - 50 hz , depending upon on the local @xmath0 , by using normal illumination from the top , with a fast camera .",
    "for an inelastic particle system to apparently behave like an elastic thermal system , the energy dissipated by each particle - particle collision should be fully recovered by energy input through particle - wall collisions before the next collision with a particle takes place .",
    "as long as this condition is satisfied , even a dissipative system apparently behaves like a thermal system , as our steel ball system does .",
    "the athermal nature is accompanied by inhomogeneization of a system and the resulting coexistence of two phases with different effective granular temperatures",
    ". such two - phase coexistence characteristic to athermal systems was already discovered for a quasi-2d driven granular system , in which bilayer formation is allowed unlike our strictly monolayer system @xcite . in such a case ,",
    "the different granular temperatures can be explained by the difference between monolayer excitation and bilayer excitation ( e.g. , differences in effective mass and type of excitation ) .",
    "however , this mechanism can not explain the two - phase coexistence we found in a driven monolayer system .",
    "below we consider the origin of inhomogeneization and the resulting coexistence of two phases with different granular temperatures on a qualitative level .    here",
    "we consider a gedanken experiment , where the inelasticity is gradually increased in a continuous manner . with an increase in the inelasticity of particles , the perfect recovery before",
    "the next interparticle collision becomes more and more difficult . with an increase in the particle density , or @xmath0 , the inter - particle collision frequency @xmath107 , which controls the rate of energy dissipation , increases but with a rather constant particle - wall collision frequency @xmath106 , which makes this recovery process less efficient .",
    "the energy dissipation is due to both the inelastic and the frictional nature of interparticle collisions .",
    "we believe that this crossover from the perfect to imperfect recovery of the kinetic energy during @xmath109 with an increase in the particle density destabilizes a non - equilibrium steady state with spatially homogeneous density and granular temperature , leading to the transition from an apparently thermal to strongly athermal behavior .",
    "now we qualitatively consider how the imperfect recovery makes a system inhomogeneous : in such a situation , the degree of recovery of the kinetic energy of a particle should decrease with an increase in local @xmath0 since @xmath107 increases with an increase in @xmath0 .",
    "thus , higher density regions formed by spontaneous fluctuations should transiently have lower kinetic energy than lower density regions , which leads to lower pressure in the former .",
    "this mechanism is essentially the same as that of clustering instability in dissipative gases @xcite .",
    "so the higher density regions are further compressed , resulting in the enhancement of density fluctuations .",
    "however , an increase in density eventually causes the increase in the inter - particle collision frequency and thus the increase in pressure . when the horizontal pressure is spatially homogeneized , this development of density fluctuations stops , ending in two - phase coexistence . in this way the system finally reaches a steady state , where the energy input rate and the dissipation rate is balanced while keeping two phases with different @xmath0 and granular temperature @xmath4",
    "thus , a high enough density region and a low enough density region should coexist in a steady state for a certain range of the average @xmath0",
    ". the average horizontal pressure in the two phases should be the same since the mechanical force balance is to be satisfied across the domain interface .",
    "because of its mechanical nature , this equal pressure condition may be hold even in an athermal condition ( see below , however , on the effect of interparticle friction )",
    ". however , the fluctuations of pressure may be much larger than in a thermal system , since the particle velocity is determined not only by interparticle collisions but also by particle - wall collisions .",
    "the another constraint comes from the condition for a steady state : the balance between the energy input rate and the dissipation rate should be balanced in each phase",
    ". the low density liquid phase is characterized by low @xmath107 , which means low energy dissipation and results in high @xmath4 , whereas the high density solid phase by high @xmath107 , which results in low @xmath4 .",
    "this situation is realized under a homogeneous energy input , or spatially homogeneous @xmath106 . on the basis of this physical picture ,",
    "below we consider a principle behind the two - phase coexistence on a phenomenological level .    here",
    "we note that it is interesting to study the dependence of the phase - transition behavior as a function of inelasticity . however , a precise control of particle inelasticity is not easy in experiments , and thus numerical simulations may be more promising .      before discussing a principle behind the two - phase coexisting more theoretically ,",
    "here we consider which theoretical framework is suitable for the description of what we discussed above .",
    "one candidate is a hydrodynamic theory for a confined granular system , which was recently developed by brito et al .",
    "it was shown that under a situation where the thermostat does not inject momentum but only energy , the equations for the conserved density field and momentum density are the continuum equation and the navier - stokes one , as in the case of usual fluids , and the equation for the non - conserved ( granular ) temperature field is a balance equation for the energy .",
    "a collisional model for a 2d system was also developed on the same basis ( see sec .",
    "iv of ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; however , in this model the stationary temperature is density independent and the pressure increases monotonically with density , and accordingly there is no two - phase coexistence , contrary to our experimental observation . in this model , the granular temperature in a homogeneous stationary state was assumed to be determined by a balance between energy dissipation and injection @xcite , but the energy dissipation due to an effective friction proportional to a particle velocity was not considered .",
    "although it is interesting to take this effect into account in this theory and to study whether it can induce two - phase coexistence , here we take a more phenomenological approach .    to take this velocity - dependent dissipative force into account in a natural manner",
    ", we consider a thermal condition to maintain a steady state in a quasi-2d system , on the basis of a langevin - like equation of motion ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "now we consider a principle behind two - phase coexistence in a non - equilibrium steady state . for a thermodynamic system , in order for two phases of the same substance in contact to be in equilibrium , there must be mechanical , thermal , and chemical equilibrium , i.e. , ( i ) equal pressure , ( ii ) equal temperature , and ( iii ) equal chemical potential . for our driven granular system , however , condition ( ii ) is not be applicable because of the out - of - equilibrium nature .",

    "we note that the viscous term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bd ] ) takes into account the friction among particles and energy transfers between various degrees of freedom ( e.g , the friction between particles and the walls ) @xcite .",
    "here we mention the random nature of force noise . in our system , the excitation itself has a well - defined frequency , but the randomization of the energy injection by interparticle collision and the wall roughness leads to a self generated effective white bath in a long timescale .",
    "the langevin - type approach can be rationalized by the fact that brownian dynamics simulations can fully reproduce the behavior of a driven monolayer granular system of weakly polydisperse steel balls even without any adjustable parameters @xcite .",
    "its validity to a rubber ball system is not obvious , but our visual inspection of the motion of steel and rubber balls at least indicates the same type of random motion .",
    "although the exact nature should be investigated , e.g. , by measuring the velocity distribution function in the future , this visual inspection and the consideration in sec .",
    "vi.c tell us that in a steady state the physics may be the same between the two systems at least on a phenomenological level .",
    "so we assume that the randomization also takes place efficiently for a rubber ball system .",

    "here we briefly consider the role of interparticle friction .",
    "although the friction coefficient itself may be similar between the steel and rubber balls , the rubber ball may have a larger coefficient of rolling friction with the walls as well as another ball upon collision than the steel ball does . on a phenomenological level",

    "the friction also affects the term @xmath136 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "we also note that the presence of interparticle friction also induces forces tangential to the domain interface .",
    "this may perturb the interface position and induce large fluctuations of the interface .",

    "the coefficient of rolling friction is generally small for smooth spherical particles .",
    "thus , we argue that the difference in the restitution coefficient between the steel and rubber ball should be the major source of the difference in the energy dissipation between the two systems .    by incorporating all the above factors ,",

    "then the two conditions @xmath147 , together with eq .",

    "another condition is the chemical equilibrium condition , which is also a subtle issue .",
    "chemical - balance conditions of two coexisting phases with different temperatures should be obtained as a steady state solution of the relevant kinetic equations also considering bond orientational and translational ordering .",
    "it may be a promising way to introduce a non - equilibrium free energy @xcite , @xmath148 , and consider the balance of @xmath149 between the two phases , which are expected to be the necessary conditions to maintain a steady state .",
    "our discussion is purely phenomenological , and furthermore we also need to consider @xmath48 .",
    "thus , a more rigorous approach is highly desirable in the future .",

    "this condition qualitatively explains why the solid phase with a higher @xmath0 tends to wet to the softer wall , which locally lowers @xmath4 .      demixing shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mixture ] can be explained by the fact that the energy loss upon collision with the top and bottom plates is smaller for steel balls than for rubber balls .",

    "to summarize , we find that energy dissipation plays a crucial role in self - organization of driven monolayer granular matter , which allows the coexistence of states with different effective temperatures , contrary to the phase coexistence in a thermal system .",
    "the two - phase coexistence obeys the lever rule as in a thermodynamic first - order transition ; however , the underlying selection rule is fundamentally different in the sense that the energy dissipation rate , which is an intrinsically non - equilibrium quantity , is the key factor of the phase selection . since our discussion is phenomenological , however , it is desirable to theoretically describe the coexistence conditions in a non - equilibrium steady state in a more rigorous manner .",

    "furthermore , computer simulations showed that the ordered phase is not present at any vibration amplitude when the inelasticity is large .",
    "similar behaviors were also reported by clerc et al .",
    "these results clearly indicate that _ ordering is suppressed by inelasticity_. we stress that this is completely the opposite to our case : in our case inelasticity changes the nature of the transition from continuous to discontinuous and the upper bound density of a disordered liquid state is lower for the inelastic system than for the elastic one , i.e. , _ inelasticity helps the ordering_. another important difference comes from the fact that bilayer formation leads to a change in the number density of the bottom layer because of the conservation of the total number of particles .",
    "this extra degree of freedom also causes a difference in the physics between the two types of systems .",
    "lobkovsky et al .",
    "@xcite showed by numerical simulations that the monolayer - bilayer transition becomes rather continuous for random forcing .",
    "this is an interesting observation in the sense that the way of driving affects the nature of the transition .",
    "however , they also showed that inelasticity suppresses the onset of the ordered phase with random forcing , as is observed in the vibrating system .",
    "we stress that this tendency is again the opposite to our case .",
    "furthermore , we note that the monolayer - bilayer formation can take place as a function of @xmath1 @xcite , whereas our transition _ can not _ be induced by changing @xmath1 , as we can see from the phase diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] . a change from a discontinuous to a continuous nature of the @xmath1-induced transition",
    "was observed with an increase in the normalized cell thickness @xmath19 from 1.83 to 1.94 @xcite .",
    "here the key control parameter is the cell thickness , which affects the symmetry of the bilayer solid phase ( square or hexatic symmetry ) @xcite , and not the degree of inelasticity .",
    "this fact and the above - mentioned crucial difference in the @xmath1-dependence of the transition also tell us that the physics is essentially different between the two cases .",
    "the phase ordering behavior in granular matter was proposed to be generally expressed by the ginzburg - landau - type free energy ( or potential ) and relevant equations of motion @xcite . on the basis of this picture , a theoretical explanation for bilayer formation was proposed by clerc et al . @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic force on the density field @xmath161 mainly comes from the effective ( non - equilibrium ) pressure gradient calculated from this potential .",
    "the authors also included the friction term for the @xmath161 field and random force noises .",
    "the kinetic equation governing the phenomena was shown to be non - diffusive and include not only @xmath162 ( i.e , @xmath163 ) but also @xmath164 ( i.e. , @xmath165 ) @xcite .",
    "the sum of these forces leads to acceleration of the field @xmath161 .",
    "the reaction - diffusion - type equation of motion with these forces captures the travelling wave features .",
    "this is markedly different from our monolayer case , where we have never observed such travelling waves .",
    "we confirmed by comparing results of experiments and those of brownian dynamics simulations that our driven monolayer granular system obeys langevin ( or brownian ) dynamics with viscous damping and random noise @xcite .",
    "this indicates that there is no acceleration term , which is proportional to @xmath165 , in our system .",
    "thus , the above theory can not be applied to our monolayer case .",
    "this presence or absence of the acceleration term crucially affects the dynamics and make our monolayer system distinct from a bilayer - forming system .",
    "nevertheless , it does not influence a steady state , since there @xmath166 for any quantity @xmath167 , in a steady state , thus , the two - phase coexistence is determined by the ginzburg - landau - type potential @xcite .",
    "this coexistence is then controlled solely by the parameter @xmath168 , which is a coefficient of the quadratic term ( @xmath169 ) in the potential .",
    "this parameter @xmath168 was assumed to be proportional to the inverse of the compressibility coefficient , as in the case of a usual thermodynamic gas - liquid coexistence .",
    "this ( negative ) compressibility tells us how easily bilayers can be formed . in this model ,",
    "the coexistence is determined by the equal pressure and the equal non - equilibrium chemical potential under the mass conservation .",
    "the parameter @xmath168 was shown to be given by the derivative of the momentum flux with respect to the density and its negative value , which leads to the coexistence , reflects the fact that the granular temperature is lower for a higher density @xcite .",
    "thus , this non - equilibrium chemical potential allows the granular temperature to be different between the two coexisting phases .",
    "here we propose an intuitive explanation for the role of inelasticity in the liquid - solid transition accompanying bilayer formation , i.e. , a relation between the above @xmath168 and inelasticity .",
    "for a quasi-2d system which can form a bilayer , even for elastic particles there is a liquid - solid coexistence ( see , e.g. , fig . 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "this is because the bilayer formation should be easier for more elastic particles since a smaller loss of the kinetic energy associated with interparticle collisions allows particles in the bottom layer to more efficiently jump to the top layer . with an increase in the inelasticity ,",
    "the discontinuous nature becomes weaker and eventually the transition becomes continuous for particles having a small enough restitution coefficient .",
    "this termination of the discontinuous first - order - like transition was called a critical point ( @xmath170 ) by clerc et al .",
    "criticality was also observed experimentally , using @xmath1 as a control parameter , when @xmath1 approaches a critical value @xcite .",
    "the theory may be valid for a quasi-2d driven granular system where bilayer formation is allowed .",
    "however , we emphasize again that the above - mentioned dependence on the inelasticity is completely opposite to what we find in our system : our central finding is that an increase in inelasticity changes the nature of the 2d liquid - solid transition from ( thermal - like ) two - step continuous transitions to a one - step discontinuous transition . for bilayer formation",
    "the kinetic energy has to overcome both gravity and energy loss due to inelastic collisions .",
    "this tells us that more elastic particles can form a bilayer more easily , as described above . to our knowledge",
    ", our work is the first to show a discontinuous first - order - like liquid - solid transition of a monolayer granular system in a high @xmath1 regime , whose nature is primarily controlled by energy dissipation , as discussed in sec .",
    "next , we mention another ` apparently ' similar behavior , but which also has a very different physical origin .",
    "olafsen and urbach @xcite reported clustering or ordering upon decreasing the vertical vibration amplitude for a quasi-2d system , but which has no upper plate and thus is not confined by two parallel walls unlike our case : at large @xmath1 , particle correlations exhibit only short - range order as in the case of equilibrium 2d hard - sphere gases , but lowering @xmath1 cools the system , resulting in a dramatic increase in correlations leading to either clustering or an ordered state .",
    "further cooling forms a collapse : a condensate of motionless balls coexisting with a less dense gas . measured velocity distributions are non - gaussian , showing nearly exponential tails . in our systems",
    ", we observed similar phenomena below a critical value of @xmath98 , which was shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd](b ) for a rubber system as the `` inhomogeneous excitation '' state ( the gray region ) . for a steel ball system",
    "this phenomenon was observed for a much lower value of @xmath1 , as described in the main text .",
    "we note that these phenomena have an essentially different physical origin , which is for example discussed in detail on the basis of molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation @xcite and a navier - stokes granular hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "nie et al . showed by md simulation @xcite that at high @xmath1 the particle motion is isotropic , and the velocity distributions are gaussian .",
    "the deviations from a gaussian distribution at low @xmath1 is related to the degree of anisotropy in the motion . below @xmath98 ,",
    "the vertical velocity distribution becomes bimodal : the cluster particles move with the plate , while the gas particles are non - interacting , as they collide primarily with the plate .",
    "they proposed that dissipative contact forces are responsible for this phenomenon .",
    "it was also mentioned by khain and aranson @xcite that the phenomenon can be viewed as a consequence of a negative compressibility of granular gas .",
    "this explanation is somewhat similar to that for bilayer formation discussed above @xcite , but the range of @xmath1 is very different between the two : the clustering is observed for low @xmath1 , whereas the ordering accompanying bilayer formation for much higher @xmath1 . in relation to this , it was stated @xcite that the behavior does not significantly depend on the inelasticity of collisions between the particles ; one does not need inelastic particle collisions to reproduce experimental observations .",
    "they proposed that the mechanism of phase separation occurring at low @xmath1 is related to the non - trivial interplay between the energy injection and the vertical temperature of the particles . in any case , thus , an inhomogeneous granular temperature is primarily a consequence of inhomogeneous energy injection .",
    "it was also shown that the behavior does not significantly depend on the inelasticity of collisions between the particles .",
    "this clearly indicates that this phenomenon has a physical origin essentially different from ours .",
    "finally , we mention gas - liquid coexistence observed in driven inelastic particles @xcite . in this case",
    ", the difference in the type of particle motion between the two phases was found to play a key role in the coexistence : in the dense liquid phase , the injected energy is quickly dissipated within the bulk by frequent interparticle collisions due to a high density . in the dilute gas phase , on the other hand , the motion of particles is synchronized with the driving , which reduces the relative velocity between particles and thus the rate of interparticle collisions .",
    "thus , two phases with a large difference in the granular temperature coexist .",
    "however , this phenomenon is also essentially different from ours , reflecting the difference in the cell thickness ( many layers vs. monolayer ) and the nature of the transition ( gas - liquid vs. liquid - solid transition ) ; for example , there is no such synchronized motion in our system .",
    "recently brito et al .",
    "@xcite showed that for a granular monolayer vibrated between the walls , uniform energy input to a system is generally a good assumption . in a quasi-2d geometry ,",
    "in which only a monolayer can exist , the system is known to remain homogeneous in the horizontal directions for a wide range of parameters .",
    "this is due to the presence of a distributed energy source .",
    "they also pointed out that in the absence of friction , this energy source is galilean invariant and conserves momentum locally . in such a quasi-2d system ,",
    "the vertical energy scale of grains is fixed by vibration parameters .",
    "we stress that the energy injection occurs only through direct collisions of a particle with the walls , and there is no other channel .",
    "this means that the energy injection rate is controlled by @xmath106 .",
    "so , as long as there are no direct geometrical restrictions to the vertical motion of the particles , it is reasonable to assume that the energy input is rather homogeneous spatially .",
    "we note that , according to our observation , there is no overlap of particle images projected onto the horizontal plane ( see , e.g. , images in fig . [",
    "fig : coexistence ] ) . for steel balls ,",
    "the input energy is homogeneous up to @xmath171 , which is much higher than the upper bound area fraction of the liquid phase , @xmath53 ( = 0.695 ) , of the rubber ball system .",
    "importantly , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] , all the phase transition area fractions , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , are independent of @xmath1 .",
    "this suggests that the particle - wall collision frequency @xmath106 may be almost the same between the two phases , or rather homogeneous spatially , for this range of @xmath1 .",
    "we note that if the particle - wall collision frequency @xmath106 ( i.e. , a vibrational parameter ) strongly depends on @xmath0 , the phase boundary compositions should also depend on @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the energy input rate may be assumed to be homogeneous .",
    "however , since the discussion above is qualitative , the spatial distribution of the energy input in two - phase coexistence needs to be checked carefully by numerical simulations in the future .    for a quasi-2d system , in which a bilayer can be formed ,",
    "the situation is very different .",
    "for example , it was clearly shown @xcite by mapping the local average rate of energy input that a square phase consisting of bilayer corresponds to a region of dramatically reduced energy input .",
    "however , this is natural since the bilayer formation itself inevitably accompanies a change in vibrational parameters ; for example , the effective mass of the vibrated object is roughly doubled by bilayer formation .",
    "we note that such effects are absent for a monolayer system , as mentioned above .",
