    "the milky way interstellar medium ( ism ) harbours gas in a variety of temperature and density regimes , all coexisting in an uneasy equilibrium readily disrupted by large scale forces ( e.g. gravitational ) or smaller scale ones ( e.g. stellar winds , shocks ) .",
    "two of these regimes are the warm - neutral ( wnm ) and warm - ionized medium ( wim ) . the galactic magnetic field ( gmf )",
    "couples to the ionized component of the ism creating the so - called magneto - ionic medium ( mim ) , and plays an essential but not well - understood role in the mixing of the neutral and ionic ism phases . because of the partial ionization by cosmic rays and x rays the fractional ionization of the wnm , @xmath13 , is non - zero .",
    "however it remains very much an unreliably measured parameter , and is key to ism studies ( see review ; * ? ? ?",
    "nonetheless , this partial ionization blurs the boundary between the wnm and the wim / mim somewhat , and hence the field may be expected to couple with the wnm as well .",
    "to what degree is a matter of debate .",
    "the mim and wnm can be linked by two observables : rotation measure ( rm ) and atomic hydrogen column density ( n@xmath14 ) .",
    "each can be respectively written as path integrals of spatial densities of electrons ( @xmath15 ) and of atoms ( @xmath16 ) : @xmath17 @xmath18 where the path integrals are taken over the entire observable path through the galactic disc , and the magnetic field @xmath19 is the line - of - sight ( los ) average value ( indicated by brackets @xmath20 ) and is assumed uncorrelated with the electron density @xmath15 . the ratio between rm and n@xmath14 is then related to the ionization fraction @xmath21 by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the path - averaged ionization fraction , related by eqn .",
    "[ xe ] to the ratio of path - averaged atomic and electron densities , i.e. @xmath24 . as long as both are observed through the same length column , rm / n@xmath14 is independent of path length , and eqn .",
    "[ ratio ] is true for any column length .",
    "equation  [ ratio ] links the wnm and mim through the ionization fraction , and is an alternative expression to the usual ratio of rotation - to - dispersion measure rm / dm for estimating @xmath25 ( see sec .",
    "[ b - est ] ) .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate of the ratio rm / n@xmath14 can be made with currently accepted estimates for the los magnetic field strength in the ism .",
    "@xmath261 to @xmath272  @xmath11 g is found by various authors for the uniform field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) near the sun ( where the negative sign indicates the field is directed away from the receiver ) , thus the los component @xmath25 is at most these values or smaller . for the ionization fraction in the wnm , @xcite find 8% at a canonical wnm density of @xmath280.5  @xmath29 within a few hundred pc of the sun , whereas @xcite obtain 2% for the wnm from a 2-phase model calculation .",
    "we use a mean of @xmath305% here for illustration ; from eqn .  [ ratio ] then one might expect to find ratios in the range of @xmath2715 to @xmath2730  rad  m@xmath8 per 10@xmath5  atoms  @xmath3 .",
    "to measure the ratio rm / n@xmath14 in eqn .",
    "[ ratio ] we use rms of 1970 extragalactic sources , calculated from cgps @xcite stokes q & u data in four 7.5  mhz - wide sub - bands observed around the 1420  mhz line .",
    "the cgps is an interferometric survey that extends from the first to the third quadrants of the galactic plane , covering 52@xmath31193@xmath32 , and @xmath273.5@xmath335.5@xmath32 in latitude , with a small extension up to @xmath3418@xmath32 in the range 99@xmath35118@xmath32 .",
    "the method used to extract the rms is described in @xcite .",
    "we assume that there is little faraday rotation from both the inter - galactic medium and from within the source itself , relative to the path - integrated galactic disc .",
    "typical uncertainties in rm are in the range of 5 - 20% .",
    "the catalogue of cgps rms , uncertainties and statistics is presented in brown et al .",
    "( 2013 , in prep . ) .",
    "the high density of rms in this catalogue provides an unmatched ability to trace large - scale galactic magnetism .",
    "for example , @xcite demonstrate that while some cgps rms suffer from random rotation due to regions along the los , removing rms most correlated with emission measure ( em@xmath36 , traced by h@xmath37 emission towards them ) does not change the distribution of the sample nor the mean rm in any significant way .",
    "the catalogue we use here includes the sources in @xcite but is more extended ; nonetheless , while some rms in our sample are undoubtedly affected by regions , the option to average rms within a narrow range of longitudes provides the ability to extract the large - scale structure of the field , and to trace the mim on the large - scale ( also demonstrated by * ? ? ?",
    "* for southern - sky rms ) .",
    "integrated atomic hydrogen column densities towards each background source are measured from cgps 21  cm line data , which has essentially the same elliptical synthesized beam as the 21  cm continuum ( fwhm@xmath381@xmath391@xmath40 ) , and a spectral resolution of 1.3  km  s@xmath41 .",
    "each velocity channel is @xmath420.824  km  s@xmath41 wide .",
    "the mean brightness temperature @xmath43 ( kelvin ) in the @xmath44-th channel is measured in an annulus around each source with an inner radius of 1  fwhm in each of the major and minor axes of the elliptical beam , and oriented in the same direction as the beam .",
    "the annulus has a width of 36@xmath45 in both dimensions .",
    "the observed column density is accumulated as in eqn .",
    "[ nhi ] over 256 velocity channels .",
    "the sum through all velocity channels records the column density through the entire galactic disc , which is the same path length over which rms are accumulated .",
    "equation  [ nhi ] is appropriate for warm ( @xmath46200  k ) and hence optically - thin ( @xmath470 ) atomic h , which is the main constituent of the wnm and the phase which would most likely couple with the wim / mim .",
    "the additional advantage of integrating the emission is that our column densities emphasize the smooth large - scale galactic distribution of the wnm , as opposed to absorption which shows very local , dense ( and optically - thick ) neutral hydrogen clouds that mainly are found associated with discrete features like young regions ( e.g. , stellar wind bubbles and expanding shocked shells , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) and spiral arm shock - fronts @xcite .",
    "these denser discrete clouds are not included in the column density integrated from emission only .",
    "the uncertainty in each value of n@xmath14 is estimated from the standard deviation of brightness temperatures within the annulus in each channel .",
    "this value is typically @xmath72 - 3  k per channel , and these are summed in quadrature to obtain an estimate for our error in n@xmath14 .",
    "figure  [ plot1 ] shows a plot of column density n@xmath0 ( units of 10@xmath5  atoms  @xmath3 ) versus rm ( rad  m@xmath8 ) .",
    "an underlying trend of increasing magnitude of rm ( negative values ) with increasing column densities is readily seen , and the scatter about a mean rm for a given column n@xmath14 does not overwhelm this trend .",
    "we see rms on either side of zero , suggesting that a random component to the field plays a significant role in the scatter .",
    "the mean rm through the cgps is negative , reflecting the los projection of the gmf in this area of the milky way which points away from the sun .",
    "the scatter in rm for a given column can come from three broad sources : i ) scatter caused by a small - scale `` random '' component related to the large - scale gmf , ii ) scatter from large - scale magnetic field reversals along the los , and iii ) scatter from smaller scale `` anomalous '' regions with a magnetic field independent of the gmf and/or electron densities different from the bulk mim ( such as regions ) .",
    "the distribution and sign ( @xmath48 ) of the rms across the cgps is shown in figure  [ distro ] , with longitude and latitude zones coloured to roughly match the colour bar in figure  [ plot1 ] .",
    "generally in the plane ( @xmath495@xmath32 ) , lower n@xmath14 are observed towards higher longitudes .",
    "we can divide figure  [ plot1 ] into four column density zones show in figure  [ distro ] , from lowest to highest : 1 ) high - latitude sources with + 5@xmath5018@xmath32 which all have measured column densities lower than 3@xmath110@xmath5  @xmath3 ( blue violet points between 100@xmath51120@xmath32 ) ; 2 ) galactic anticentre sources ( orange points with 150@xmath52190@xmath32 ) generally between 3 to 6@xmath110@xmath5  @xmath3 , 3 ) intermediate-@xmath53 sources through the outer galaxy ( 90@xmath51150@xmath32 ; blue - violet - red ) with n@xmath546 to 9@xmath110@xmath5  @xmath3 , and 4 ) low - longitude sources with @xmath5590@xmath32 that pass through the inner and outer galaxy and that generally have the highest columns in the sample ( n@xmath569@xmath110@xmath5  @xmath3 ) , though many have smaller columns where we look down the lower - density interarm region between the sagittarius and local arms .    a general analysis of the rm scatter in each column density zone is telling . in 21",
    "cm cgps continuum maps no regions are observed in zone  1 , and given that sources in this region have rm near zero , the strength of the gmf here and the @xmath15 , relative to the plane regions , are small .",
    "hence the scatter in zone  1 rms is dominated by the small - scale random component of the field .",
    "zone  2 is also a region of low rm ( since the los projection of the large - scale gmf is diminished towards the anticentre ) but these sources are in the galactic plane and are seen towards many bright catalogued regions ; scatter in this region would thus be due to both the effects of small - scale variations in the gmf and of random fields and high @xmath15 in regions .",
    "however , the scatter in zone  2 is barely higher than in zone  1 , thus the scatter in rm , and the mean rm itself in these directions is not dominated by the regions seen along these paths .",
    "zone  3 shows moderately increased scatter with more true `` outliers '' on either side of the mean , likely reflecting the longer integrated path length which would intercept more regions .",
    "however , the majority of zone  3 sources are tightly clustered around the mean rm@xmath570 , similar to the concentration in zone  1 . again",
    ", we conclude that while regions likely do contribute to the scatter in rm , they are not the dominant component along the los nor across the plane on the sky ( as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ obs ] this conclusion is also demonstrated in * ? ? ?",
    "sources in zone  4 have long lines - of - sight ( turquoise - blue points for 65@xmath5285@xmath32 ) that pass down a substantial column of the local arm and are mainly parallel with the large - scale field in that arm .",
    "as suggested in @xcite the small - scale field is likely correlated with the large - scale field , and therefore , these lines - of - sight show significant variability in @xmath19 .",
    "they also pass through more @xmath15 structures that are located within this arm ( particularly cygnus  x ) , all of which contribute to strong spatial variability in rm . finally for direction @xmath5865@xmath32 ( pure green points )",
    "the large - scale field is observed to _",
    "reverse _ direction through the sagittarius arm tangent and the interarm region beyond this arm @xcite .",
    "the very high scatter in zone  4 is therefore likely from all three sources .      to elucidate the underlying relationship , we group the rm data into column density bins 4@xmath110@xmath2  @xmath3 wide , and calculate the robust mean rotation measure in each bin using maximum likelihood estimates ( `` m''-estimates ) to mitigate the effects of outliers ( like regions ) . only bins with @xmath593 rm sources",
    "are considered , and the uncertainty in the mean of each bin ( @xmath60rm ) is the median absolute deviation over @xmath61 .",
    "results are shown in figure  [ plot2 ] .",
    "the robust m - estimates result in a quite well - determined mean rm for given values of n@xmath14 .",
    "a robust least - squares fit to the binned data weighted by @xmath60rm shows an underlying linear relationship with a slope of @xmath2719.2@xmath71.6  rad  m@xmath8/10@xmath5  atoms  @xmath3 , and at zero column density a constant of 34.5@xmath78.5  rad  m@xmath8 .",
    "the non - zero column density here at rm@xmath620 is likely a natural consequence of lines - of - sight through regions with @xmath630 , such as in directions towards the anticentre .",
    "the pearson ( correlation ) coefficient of the points after binning is r=0.78 .",
    "the strong linear correlation between the mean rm and n@xmath14 could arise because each depends on something else in common .",
    "for example , lower rotation measures and column densities are both found in directions where the integrated path length is smaller through the disk ; i.e. high longitudes ( near the anticentre ) or high latitudes .",
    "directions near @xmath64180@xmath32 are also where there would be no los - component of a purely azimuthal field , since geometrically @xmath65 , and for a circularly oriented field of uniform strength @xmath66 along a circle of radius @xmath67 . _ along _ the los through the outer galaxy the uniform - field s strength and the electron density fall with @xmath68 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) whereas the density of stays nearly constant to at least @xmath6913  kpc ( see fig.7.15   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , falling thereafter with an exponential decay ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in high latitude directions",
    "the atomic and electron densities and the field strength also diminish , each with different characteristic heights ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the amount of disk matter sampled along each direction changes in a more complicated way than it would across longitude - varying directions at constant latitude due to the warping of the midplane and the flaring of its thickness @xcite .    to test this possibility , we isolate two regions of the cgps . in region  1",
    "we restrict the dependence to longitude only by looking at sources across a wide longitude strip 90@xmath51180@xmath32 in a narrow latitude range centred on the plane ( @xmath273.5@xmath705@xmath32 ; 1110 sources ) . for region  2",
    "we take sources in a vertical strip across a wide latitude ( @xmath273.5@xmath7018@xmath32 ) centred within a narrow longitude range ( 95@xmath51125@xmath32 ; 692 sources )",
    ". the dependence of integrated path length on direction across each strip should be markedly different , since it is expected that @xmath71 and @xmath19 are changing in very different ways and for different reasons across each region .",
    "if there is an underlying dependence on direction the observed relationship between rm and n@xmath14 in each should also be different . remarkably , however , the fitted lines in region  1 ( slope @xmath2723.2@xmath72.3 , intercept 45.0@xmath713.8 , r=0.87 ) and region  2 ( @xmath2726.9@xmath72.5  rad  m@xmath8/10@xmath5  atoms  @xmath3 , 44.0@xmath710.9  rad  m@xmath8 ; r=0.79 ) are essentially identical ( figure  [ plot3 ] ) , evidence that the ratio of rm / n@xmath14 is independent of direction @xmath53 and of direction @xmath72 .",
    "a linear relationship observed between these variables would still exist whether we correct each for the same direction / path effect or not , with only the slope potentially changed .",
    "the remarkable constancy of the slope in different regions of the survey is thus indicating that something other than mutual directional dependence is being observed .",
    "we can use equation  [ ratio ] to estimate the bulk mean gmf strength in the cgps region for a given mean ionization fraction , and vice - versa . for this",
    "we must be mindful that if there are reversals along the los , the value of the ratio rm / n@xmath14 will be closer to zero and calculated values for @xmath25 or @xmath23 will be lower limits to the actual values . for our estimate",
    "we avoid rms in the inner galaxy quadrant i ( to avoid the field reversal ) , and restrict our estimate to qii ( 90@xmath51180@xmath32 ) where the uniform component will be pointed away from the observer and rms tracing the field will be negative . other smaller - scale contributors to rm ( regions , for example ) are expected to have an unsubstantial impact on the mean since the large number of lines - of - sight we use ensures that localized regions do not dominate the large - scale trends in each bin ( again , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a ratio rm / n@xmath7321.8@xmath71.5  rad  m@xmath8/10@xmath5  atoms  @xmath3 is found , with r=0.94",
    "within a few hundred parsecs of the sun , @xcite find @xmath740.08 ( for a mean total h density of @xmath280.5  @xmath29 ) . if we take this as representative of the bulk volume - averaged value , then the los component of the outer galaxy gmf is @xmath750.95@xmath70.06  @xmath11 g . a slightly higher mean field of @xmath271.0@xmath70.1  @xmath11 g is found if we also restrict sources to the immediate galactic plane ; @xmath765@xmath32 ( region  1 in sec .",

    "both are very consistent with @xmath771.2@xmath70.48  @xmath11 g , the value near the sun from @xcite and an upper - limit for the mean los - projection component ( @xcite use the same rms as we do but rely on the @xmath15 model of @xcite ) .",

    "if we use the local regular magnetic field strength estimate @xmath782  @xmath11 g of @xcite , then @xmath794.2% , intermediate between the two previously published results .",

    "[ ratio ] with widely - accepted values for the uniform field strength results in low ( @xmath5710% ) ionization fractions that are consistent with the range accepted for the wnm .",

    "( using wnm values for @xmath13 ) with the field estimated by @xcite ( using dispersion measures from the @xmath15 model of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that most of the electrons in the large - scale mim responsible for pulsar dm are related to the atoms in the wnm .",
    "our observed ratio rm / n@xmath14 seems to be sufficient to predict the magnitude of the magnetic field in the general mim , suggesting that electrons from fully ionized regions of the wim account for very little rm and that a very large fraction of the electrons seen in the galactic plane arise from the partially ionized wnm , compared to the fully ionized , low density wim .",
    "however , as the field and ionization fractions of the wnm are not known with terrific accuracy , we can not provide a viable quantitative estimate of this fraction .",
    "nonetheless , qualitatively it appears that the boundary between the wnm and mim is very much indistinct and that the gmf itself may be supported by the partially ionized wnm .",
    "using observations from the cgps we have found a linear correlation between rotation measure and column density ( for the optically thin wnm gas ) .",
    "the slope rm / n@xmath14 observed is of the same order expected from a simple theoretical calculation ( eqn .  [ ratio ] ) with current estimates of the ionization fraction in the wnm and the bulk los magnetic field in the outer galaxy . since the ratio rm / n@xmath14 ultimately has units of radians of rotation per 10@xmath5 h atoms it is independent of path length , and its observed value can be used to estimate mean magnetic fields and/or ionization fractions in any region of interest , regardless of its dimension .",
    "therefore measurement of this ratio and eqn .",
    "[ ratio ] may offer a way of studying either the ( unknown ) magnetic field or ionization fraction in smaller discrete regions of the ism where the other ( known ) parameter can be more safely assumed constant throughout . this may offer some advantage over the current approach of estimating field strengths with the ( path - integrated ) dispersion measure .",
