    "based on whether the timescale for neutron capture is slower or faster than the @xmath3-decay timescale for unstable nuclei , the nuclei beyond the iron group are created in neutron - capture processes , i.e. s- ( slow ) or r- ( rapid ) .",
    "the two neutron - capture processes are thought to occur under different physical conditions and therefore likely to arise in different astrophysical sites .",
    "the s - process , which requires a lower neutron flux ( with a typical neutron - capture taking many years ) , is generally thought to occur during the double - shell burning phase of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars with low- and intermediate - mass @xcite .",
    "the r - process requires a high neutron flux level ( with many neutron - captures over a timescale of a fraction of a second ) , which is expected to take place in the exploding astrophysical site or sites such as the @xmath4-driven wind of type ii ( i.e. core - collapse ) supernovae @xcite , the mergers of neutron stars @xcite , accretion - induced collapse ( aic ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and type 1.5 supernovae @xcite etc .",
    "low - mass agb stars are as well known as the main site for the s - process elements producing @xcite . during their thermally pulsing ( tp ) phase of agb stars ,",
    "some protons are assumed to penetrate into the top layers of the he - intershell from the bottom of the convective envelope , and then captured by the freshly synthesised @xmath5c then directly producing @xmath6c via the @xmath5c(p , @xmath7 ) @xmath6n(@xmath8 , @xmath4)@xmath6c reactions @xcite .",
    "the primary - like reaction , @xmath6c(@xmath9 , n)@xmath10o which works at a temperature of about @xmath11 k , is generally regarded as the major neutron source of the s - process nucleosynthesis . based on a specific hydrodynamical treatment , @xcite pointed out that at the border between the upper h - rich convective envelope and the lower c - rich and he - rich radiative he - intershell , some physical mechanisms such as rotational mixing , shear turbulence , gravitational waves , thermodynamical instability and so on could affect the downflow of protons from the envelope .",
    "in fact , the precise mechanism for how protons penetrate into the he - intershell is still unknown .",
    "finally , c and s - elements were brought to the surface of agb stars from he - intershell by the recurrent third dredge - up ( tdu ) events .",
    "then , different degrees of abundance enhancement of these elements should be observed , which is related to different initial masses and metallicities .",
    "so far , many metal - poor stars have been found based on some special surveys for metal - poor stars which finished or undergoing now , such as the hk survey @xcite , the hamburg / eso survey @xcite , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , as well as the subprogram of sdss , i.e. the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue , * ? ? ?",
    "where , at least @xmath12 and probably as much as @xmath13 of galactic stars with [ fe / h]@xmath14 were identified as carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp , with [ c / fe]@xmath15 ) stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite have classified cemp - stars as cemp - s , cemp - r , cemp - r / s and cemp no in which no enhanced r- or s - elements observed .",
    "these old stars with low initial mass ( @xmath16 ) are still on their main - sequence or giant evolution phase .",
    "@xcite reported that about @xmath17 of cemp - stars are cemp - s stars which showing high enhancement of s - elements .",
    "the plausible scenario for the origin of the c and s - elements of cemp - stars is usually attributed to mass transfer from their former agb companions ( white dwarfs now ) by the stellar wind - accretion in binary systems .",
    "it is as well known that eu is one of the most readily measurable elements in optical spectra of metal - poor stars , which is mainly synthesised through r - process .",
    "actually , eu is always used as a represent element of r - process . at present , about half of cemp - s stars",
    "are found with higher eu enhancement , i.e. cemp - r / s stars @xcite .",
    "the discovery of cemp - r / s stars @xcite is puzzling , as their formation requires pollution from both an agb star and a supernova .",
    "the origin of the abundance peculiarities of cemp - r / s stars is sill a debate issue now , and many scenarios have been presented ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for detail ) .",
    "@xcite proposed a scenario for the formation of cemp - r / s stars . in this case , the c and s - process material was firstly produced and then accreted from an agb primary star , which has evolved to a white dwarf .",
    "then , the white dwarf accretes matter from the secondary one and soon the mass transfer triggered an aic event .",
    "the neutrino wind created by the collapse produces r - process elements , which pollutes the secondary one again .",
    "however , it is still far from certain that whether the r - process elements can be produced during aic .",
    "another possible scenario is that the agb star transfers s - rich materials to the observed star but does not suffer a large mass loss and at the end of the agb phase , the degenerate core may reach the chandrasekhar mass which leading to a type 1.5 supernova .",
    "the reason is due to the low mass - loss rate of agb star at low metallicity @xcite .",
    "such supernovae could explain both the enhancement pattern and the metallicity dependence of the double - enhanced halo stars .",
    "the r - process prepollution is also a possible scenario for cemp - r / s star formation . in this picture , the formation of binary systems was triggered by a supernova which polluted and clumped a nearby molecular cloud .",
    "so , the observed star was firstly enhanced with r - process elements as it once formed , and then received large amounts of s - process elements from its massive agb companion and finally turned into a cemp - r / s star @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that this scenario could possibly explain the formation of cemp - r / s stars .    excepting cemp - s stars ,",
    "some peculiar red giants with high metallicity similar to the sun are known as `` barium stars '' , or `` baii stars '' which were firstly defined by @xcite .",
    "initially , barium stars only included g and k giants which exhibit enhanced features of baii , srii , ch , cn lines and sometimes c@xmath18 molecular bands .",
    "many qualitative studies on barium stars have been developed .",
    "barium stars could not be self - enriched , i.e. synthesizing s - process elements in interiors and dredging s - rich materials up to the surface of envelope , because of their lower mass and lower luminosity than those of agb stars .",
    "periodic variations of the radial velocity have been detected for many barium stars , supporting the scenario that these stars belong to binary systems , and have accreted s - process material from their agb companions ( a white dwarf now ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have detected some of their white dwarf companions in the uv with the international ultraviolet explorer . obviously , both barium stars and cemp - s stars have the similar origin for their enhanced s - elements .    with the help of analysing the abundance patterns of heavy elements enriched stars , the detailed information of s - process nucleosynthesis which taking place in agb stars can be obtained .",
    "in this paper , we focus on the s - process nucleosynthesis at different metallicities , and compare the theoretical yields calculated by our parametric model @xcite with the sample stars . in order to get a broader view about the s - process nucleosynthesis , cemp - s , cemp - r / s and barium stars",
    "were all included into the sample stars of this work .",
    "moreover , study on the proper sample stars might enable us to directly investigate the products of individual processes , s- and r - process here , and to identify the respective astrophysical sites hoping for r - process .",
    "the chosen sample stars are described in sect .",
    "2 , the analysing for the abundance ratios distribution of heavy elements in sect . 3 , and the introduction of the parametric model in sect .",
    "4 . in sect .",
    "5 the simulation results and the nucleosynthetic effects are discussed , while conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "it is well known that the abundances of heavy elements , such as sr , ba , pb , and so on , are enhanced in barium stars ( `` metal - rich '' ) , cemp - s and cemp - r / s stars , which degree just differ by metallicity . recently ,",
    "more detailed and more precise abundance data for heavy elements of barium stars have been presented by some works , e.g. @xcite .",
    "in addition , the largest wide - field spectroscopic surveys for metal - poor stars to date and their following high - resolution observations , e.g. the hk survey @xcite and the he s survey @xcite , have provided abundant abundance data with high quality for cemp - s and cemp - r / s stars from our early galaxy .",
    "all of these excellent works make it possible to study the s - process nucleosynthesis at different metallicities by analysing the abundance pattern of heavy elements of sample stars with a wide metallicity range .",
    "it is very important to study such kinds of stars for a better understanding of the efficiency of the s - process at different metallicity in our galaxy .",
    "we explore the pattern of s - process nucleosynthesis with metallicity by comparing the observed abundance of neutron - capture elements with those of the predicted s- and r - process contributions , as the more complete abundance pattern for the neutron - capture elements provides an improved constraint on the nature of the s - process nucleosynthesis . among barium stars , cemp - s and cemp - r /",
    "s stars from the literature , we selected only those with all of the following four elements detection , i.e. sr ( or y for the first s - peak ) , ba ( for the second s - peak ) , eu ( for the r - process ) and pb ( for the third s - peak ) . in order to include sample stars as many as possible , some stars with one of the four elements mentioned above",
    ", whose upper limit abundance was detected , were also selected . according to this standard , we collected 27 barium stars as displayed in table 1 , nine cemp - s and 15 cemp - r / s stars as displayed in table 3 .",
    "in addition , eight barium stars with theoretical values of pb abundance predicted by @xcite were also included , as there are no observational pb data available from the literatures .",
    "spectroscopic data of barium stars were adopted from @xcite , and @xcite , while for the metal - poor stars , the observation data were taken from @xcite .",
    "elements with @xmath19 are labeled in neutron - capture . though the cumulated content of neutron - capture elements is only about @xmath20 percent by number of solar material , but they can produce significant spectral absorption lines , and thus can be detected in stars over a wide metallicity range @xcite .",
    "so far , many heavy elements have been observed for stars with different metallicity .",
    "there are three peaks on the s - process path , i.e. the first s - peak at sr , y , zr ( light - s elements , at the neutron magic number n = 50 ) , the second s - peak at ba , la , ce , etc ( heavy - s elements , at n = 82 ) and the third peak at pb and bi ( n = 126 ) , which locate at the termination point of the s - process path . for convenience , we adopt ba , la , ce to represent the heavy - s elements , which is labeled as  hs \" hereafter , and sr , y , zr to represent the light - s elements labeled as  ls \" .    in figure",
    "[ fig : xfe ] , we show , respectively , [ pb / fe ] and [ hs / fe ] as a function of [ fe / h ] with different symbols employed for barium , cemp - s , and cemp - r / s stars .",
    "the filled circles represent barium stars , and the red ones represent the one whose lead abundance was predicted by @xcite .",
    "the unfilled circles represent cemp - s stars , while unfilled triangles represent cemp - r / s stars . from figure",
    "[ fig : xfe ] , we can see that both [ pb / fe ] and [ hs / fe ] have the same tendency , i.e. increasing with decreasing metallicity , which is consistent with the s - process calculation results of agb stars with low metallicities @xcite . for the cemp samples , however , [ pb / fe ] locates in the range of @xmath21 which is almost higher than that of [ hs / fe ] ( @xmath22 @xmath23 ) .",
    "the standard agb models , which based on the primary like character of the main neutron source , @xmath6c(@xmath9 , n)@xmath10o , predict that low - metallicity agb stars should exhibit higher over - abundances of heavier s - elements ( z @xmath24 56 ) compared to the lighter ones ( such as sr , y , zr , etc ) . especially the hugely enhanced pb and bi",
    "should be attributed to the large number ratios of neutron to iron seeds in low - metallicity environments @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the s - elements seen in cemp - s stars should be the result of mass transfer from the winds of agb companions ( the undetected white dwarf now ) , because nearly all of them are dwarfs or giants with low luminosities , which are much fainter than agb stars .",
    "many studies on cemp - r / s and barium stars all agree that the observed overabundance of s - process elements were accreted from the initially more massive star that underwent the agb phase @xcite , although the origin of r - enhanced material for cemp - r / s stars is still in debate @xcite .",
    "considering the effect of mass transfer in a binary system , it is difficult to constrain the initial abundances of the s - process synthesis regions from observations of [ x / fe ] ratios . nevertheless ,",
    "when we study the s - process nucleosynthesis in agb stars , the mass transfer uncertainty could be canceled if using the abundance ratios , e.g. [ pb / hs ] @xcite . as the intrinsic indices [ pb / hs ] are independent of that whether the s - enhanced star is an intrinsic or extrinsic agb , it is very useful to investigate the efficiency of the s - process .    in figure",
    "[ fig : pbhs]a , b , we show [ pb / hs ] versus [ fe / h ] and [ pb / fe ] , respectively , the symbols have the same meanings as in figure  [ fig : xfe ] .",
    "we can see that the [ pb / hs ] values of both cemp - s and cemp - r / s stars are almost higher than 0 , while , on the contrary , they are almost lower than 0 for barium stars . moreover , the larger scatter of [ pb / hs ] at low - metallicity exists as discussed by @xcite and @xcite , which are about 2 dex among cemp - s and cemp - r / s stars , while 1 dex in barium stars .",
    "in addition , although the [ hs / fe ] of cemp - r / s stars is almost higher than that of cemp - s stars , there are no obviously different in the distribution of [ pb / hs ] between these two type stars , which is consistent with the result of @xcite .",
    "this result proves that the s - process material of both cemp - s and cemp - r / s stars should have a uniform origin , i.e. mass transfer from their pre - dominant agb companions in the corresponding binary systems .",
    "it is interesting that the [ hs / fe ] of cemp - r / s stars is higher than that of cemp - s stars ( see figure  [ fig : xfe]b ) , and the abundance ratio [ pb / fe ] shows a similar tendency ( see figure  [ fig : pbhs]b ) , i.e. at a fixed [ pb / hs ] value , [ pb / fe ] of cemp - r / s stars is always larger than that of cemp - s stars . as it is well known that the neutron - capture elements beyond the iron group are created by some combination of the s- and r - process nucleosynthesis , with each responsible for approximately half of the isotopes .",
    "this tendency implies that , excluding the s - process contribution , the r - process of cemp - r / s stars should contribute to both the second s - peak and the third s - peak elements with similar proportion .",
    "which is also consistent with the proportions of r - process to these elements for their solar abundances , i.e. ba @xmath25 , la @xmath26 , ce @xmath27 ( second s - peak elements ) and pb @xmath13 ( third s - peak elements ) ( adopted from * ? ? ?",
    "in other words , the enhanced over - abundances of heavier s - elements in cemp - r / s stars than those in cemp - s stars , such as pb , ba , la , etc , should be attributed to r - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "recent studies indicate that the main - r process is responsible for a pure r - process abundance pattern for the heavy r - process elements @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that this pattern is remarkably stable from star to star , and in excellent agreement with the contribution of the r - process to the solar abundances .",
    "moreover , the stability of the observed abundance pattern of r - process , and the good agreement with the solar system r - process contribution imply that the r - process events generate a universal abundance distribution , which hints that the r - process origin of cemp - r / s stars should be closely linked to the main r - process , especially for the elements with @xmath29 .",
    "figure  [ fig : hsls]a , b show [ ls / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] and [ hs / ls ] versus [ hs / fe ] , respectively .",
    "there is no obvious distribution difference of [ ls / fe ] between cemp - s and cemp - r / s stars ( see figure  [ fig : hsls]a ) .",
    "this means that the light - s elements ( such as sr , y , zr , etc . ) of such two kinds of stars should have a similar origin , i.e. mass transfer from their pre - agb companions .",
    "however , the cemp - r / s stars almost show higher values of both [ hs / ls ] and [ hs / fe ] than cemp - s stars .",
    "this could be explained by the fact that for the cemp - r / s stars the r - process have done a large contribution to their heavy - s elements , but a marginal contribution to their light - s elements . in figure",
    "[ fig : cfenfe ] , we present [ n / fe ] versus [ c / fe ] for cemp - s and -r / s stars .",
    "the similar distribution of [ n / fe ] and [ c / fe ] between cemp - s and -r / s stars also supports that they have suffered an agb pollution which brought much n , c and s - elements .",
    "figure  [ fig : euba]a shows the abundance ratio [ eu / fe ] versus [ ba / fe ] for cemp - r / s stars .",
    "an obvious correlation between [ eu / fe ] and [ ba / fe ] can be seen from this figure .",
    "it is strange that , as we know , eu and ba were produced by two independent process ( i.e. r- and s - process ) , respectively . for the formation of cemp - r / s stars , a popular mechanism is the r - elements pre - enrichment , i.e. r - process material firstly polluted the molecular cloud before the formation of such type stars . it should be noted that the initial r - enrichment does not affect the s - process nucleosynthesis @xcite . to explain this correlation",
    ", we have to expect a similar correlation between the dilution event for r- and s - elements during the mass transfer .",
    "@xcite , however , thought the more reasonable view is that only one process , i.e. the s - process , is responsible for the production of both ba and eu , because the agb stars can produce quite high [ eu / fe ] .",
    "in fact , there is a difficulty that whether the s - process could be able to produce a reasonable proportion among the 2nd and 3rd r - peak elements such as te , eu , os , pt and so on for cemp - r / s stars @xcite .",
    "we collected here almost all ( about 13 ) r - ii stars ( [ eu / fe]@xmath301.0 and [ ba / eu]@xmath310 , see @xcite ) observed up to now : cs 31082 - 001 @xcite , cs 22892 - 052 @xcite , cs 22183 - 031 @xcite , cs 22953 - 003 @xcite , cs 29491 - 069 , he 1219 - 0312 @xcite , cs 29497 - 004 , he 0430 - 4901 , he 0432 - 0923 , he 1127 - 1143 , he 2224 + 0143 , he",
    "2327 - 5642 @xcite , he 1523 - 0901 @xcite . for comparison , we plot in figure  [ fig : euba]b [ eu / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] of these r - ii stars and cemp - r / s stars . from figure",
    "[ fig : euba]b , we can see different dependence of [ eu / fe ] on metallicity between cemp - r / s and r - ii stars .",
    "[ eu / fe ] of r - ii stars decreases with [ fe / h ] , and reaches a small [ eu / fe ] value ( about 1.05 ) at [ fe / h]@xmath322.5 .",
    "the up [ eu / fe ] limit of cemp - r / s stars , however , still keep a high value ( about 1.97 ) unchanged up to [ fe / h]@xmath322.0 . furthermore",
    ", [ eu / fe ] of r - ii stars span a smaller range of [ fe / h ] , i.e. @xmath33[fe / h]@xmath34 , than that of cemp - r / s stars which is from [ fe / h]@xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "this means that the r - process responsible for r - ii and cemp - r / s stars should have different physical conditions .",
    "the snii accompanied with r - process maybe have different yields and initial mass .",
    "the r - process yields responsible for cemp - r / s stars should increase with [ fe / h ] in order to keep [ eu / fe ] unchanged . for r - ii stars , however , the r - process yields of snii maybe remain stable , the decreasing should be due to the increasing iron abundance in the interstellar medium ( ism hereafter ) . the different [ fe / h ] range of r - ii and cemp - r / s stars maybe is the reason of the small number of r - ii stars observed up to now .",
    "large samples of s - enhanced stars with wide metallicity ranges , including barium stars , cemp - s stars , cemp - r / s stars , can provide a whole information about the nature of s - process .",
    "abundance signatures of heavy elements can help to identify the environment of s - process nucleosynthesis regions @xcite . as the physical mechanism of the proton mixing from the hydrogen - rich envelope to the @xmath5c - rich layer to form a @xmath6c pocket @xcite is still unknown , the parametric studies are still very useful to explain the formation of s - enhanced stars . in this paper",
    ", we adopted an parametric model developed by @xcite to simulate the abundance patterns of barium , cemp - s and cemp - r / s stars in order to provide further insight into the nature of s - process nucleosynthesis in the galaxy .",
    "four parameters are needed by the parametric model for calculating the s - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "they are the neutron exposure per thermal pulse @xmath37 , the overlap factor @xmath0 , the component coefficient of the s - process @xmath2 and the component coefficient of the r - process @xmath1 , where @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the average thermal velocity of neutrons at @xmath40 k ( the appropriate temperature for the @xmath6c@xmath41o reaction working ) . in this model , the abundance of the @xmath42th element in the observed star is calculated as follows : @xmath43 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the metallicity of the star , @xmath45 is the abundance of the @xmath42th element produced by s - process and @xmath46 is the abundance from r - process , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the component coefficients that correspond to contributions from the s - process and the r - process , respectively ( see zhang , ma & zhou , 2006 for details ) .",
    "barium stars belong to the stellar population i , which were formed in a similar condition with the solar system . in other words ,",
    "these stars were ` rich ' in metallicity as soon as they were formed .",
    "thus , we adopted the scaled solar element abundances based on [ fe / h ] of barium stars as the initial abundances of seed nuclei , and the same method were adopted for the initial seed nuclei lighter than the iron peak elements of the cemp - s and cemp - r / s stars . in the metal - poor environment , however , the neutron - capture elements in molecular clouds , where cemp - s and cemp - r / s stars formed , were mainly produced by r - process .",
    "generally , the r - process abundance pattern of stable neutron - capture elements is divided into two parts , i.e. the r - elements with @xmath49 and @xmath29 .",
    "the r - elements with @xmath29 are mainly produced by the main - r process , while the lighter ones are mainly contributed by a light element primary process ( lepp ) or / and weak - r process @xcite .",
    "the main - r process produced a stable abundance pattern from star - to - star for elements with @xmath28 , which is consistent with a scaled solar r - process pattern @xcite .",
    "thus , the scaled solar r - process abundance @xcite were adopted as the initial abundance of the heavy elements ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "to the light nuclei ( @xmath49 ) , it is still not clear that whether the r - process pattern is stable from star - to - star , because of the still limited amount of stellar observations for these elements up to now @xcite .",
    "thus , for the light nuclei we adopted the method suggested by @xcite .    during the calculations , the chi - square ( i.e. @xmath50 ) test was also applied in order to get the best simulation results , and the parameters of s - process nucleosynthesis region .",

    "there are some stars , such as hd 5424 and hd 107574 , whose @xmath0 values are lower than @xmath53 , which means that few seed nuclei could experience successive neutron exposure , in other word , the third dredge - up event is very efficient in this case .",

    "the lower @xmath0 value means that only a few seed nuclei can receive the succeeding neutron exposure during the next interpulse phase , in other words , the efficiency of the third dredge - up in their former agb companions is very high .",

    "we note this situation is also happened for barium stars as discussed above , thus , we can see that the single exposure event for the s - process nucleosynthesis is general in a wide metallicity range of our galaxy",
    ". combining the analytical formula of the overlap factor given by @xcite with the initial - final mass relation for agb stars @xcite , @xcite derived a function of @xmath0 varying with metallicity and initial mass of agb stars . using this function",
    ", we can find the @xmath0 range of the agb stars with initial mass range @xmath67 m@xmath68 is very similar with that found in this work excluding the two stars , he 1305 - 0007 , and hd 189711 .",
    "the neutron exposure per pulse , @xmath37 , is also a fundamental parameter in the s - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath37 vary from 0.23 mbarn@xmath61 to 0.88 mbarn@xmath61 .",
    "we compared the @xmath37 value with the one we can get from the literature for two stars , lp 625 - 44 and lp 706 - 7 .",
    "our values , 0.69 mbarn@xmath61 and 0.82 mbarn@xmath61 are very close to their ones , 0.71 mbarn@xmath61 and 0.80 mbarn@xmath61 @xcite , respectively .",
    "the mean neutron exposure ( @xmath55 ) , here , is even a more important parameter for the s - process nucleosynthesis calculation , whose value mainly dominate the final abundance distribution of the s - process elements in agb stars . in general , the larger value of @xmath55 , the more heavier elements can be produced .",
    "for example , the lead stars produced in the low metallicity environments where the higher @xmath55 exists .      in order to get a broader view of the s - process nucleosynthesis",
    ", we compare the physical parameters relating to metal - poor stars and barium stars together in the following text , especially to identify the impact of metallicity .",
    "figure  [ fig : ofnepp ] shows @xmath0 and @xmath37 versus [ fe / h ] , respectively .",
    "the filled circles represent barium stars , and the unfilled circles represent cemp - s stars , while the unfilled triangles represent cemp - r / s stars .",
    "we can see that the range of @xmath0 for metal - poor stars ( @xmath69 ) , is larger than that for barium stars ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "obviously , the s - process nucleosynthesis is more complicated in metal - poor stars .",
    "it should be noted that most @xmath0 values of our metal - poor samples are larger than 0.40 ( see figure  [ fig : ofnepp]a ) . as discussed above",
    ", the larger the overlap factor value is , the more iron seeds can receive repeated neutron exposure , which is in favour of heavier elements producing , such as ba , pb , etc .",
    "@xcite gave a @xmath0 range , i.e. @xmath70 , using their dedicated evolutionary model for agb stars with initial mass from 1 to 3 @xmath71 and metallicity from solar to half solar .",
    "obviously , they are larger than ours for barium stars .",
    "nevertheless , it should be kept in mind that , in gallino et al.s model , only @xmath72 fraction material can really receive the neutron exposure each time .    from figure",
    "[ fig : ofnepp]b , we can see that @xmath37 value increases with decreasing metallicity , which also support the results of favoring heavier elements production , due to the higher ratio of neutron to iron seeds in low metallicity environment .",
    "@xcite presented a formula , i.e. @xmath73 , to describe the equilibrium neutron density for the primary neutron source @xmath6c(@xmath9 , n)@xmath10o , where the constant @xmath74 is roughly given by the ratio of the average neutron - capture cross section times abundance for newly synthesized elements ( i.e. so - called primary neutron poisons , such as @xmath10o , @xmath75n , etc . ) to the average capture cross section times solar abundance for heavy initial elements , usually @xmath76 is adopted . @xcite and @xcite provided a more simplified relationship between the neutron density and metallicities , i.e. the typical neutron density in the nucleosynthesis zone scales roughly as @xmath77 , for @xmath78 . at low metallicities , the effect of the primary poisons prevails",
    "the tendency of neutron density varying with metallicity can be seen clearly from figure  [ fig : ofnepp]b .",
    "of course , the neutron exposure time must be considered simultaneously .",
    "in addition , no apparent distribution difference between @xmath0 and @xmath37 values can be found for both cemp - s and cemp - r / s stars .    as we know , @xmath55 represents the synthetical effect of @xmath0 and @xmath37 , and determines the final abundance distribution of heavy elements in agb stars , thus , it s a more important parameter here .",
    "we present lg@xmath79 versus [ fe / h ] in figure  [ fig : mnefeh ] , and a larger scatter exists in lg@xmath79 for cemp - s and cemp - r / s stars than that in barium stars can be seen , and the lg@xmath79 values of cemp - s and cemp - r / s stars are generally larger than those of barium stars . obviously , the efficiency of s - process nucleosynthensis responsible for heavy neutron - capture elements of metal - poor samples is higher than that of barium stars . in other words , the more enhanced heavy elements , especially for pb ,",
    "can be reached at the lower metallicity environments , which has be proved by the observation data shown in figure  [ fig : xfe ] and  [ fig : pbhs ] , especially , the [ pb / hs ] values of metal - poor stars are almost larger than 0 , while the barium stars on the contrary .",
    "of course , this could not work at a ultra low - metallicity environment , because the medium- and low - mass stars had nt evolved to agb phase , which is thought as the most appropriate site for s - process nucleosynthesis .    from figures  [ fig : ofnepp ] and",
    "[ fig : mnefeh ] we can see that the three important parameters refer to s - process nucleosynthesis , i.e. @xmath0 , @xmath37 , @xmath79 , have similar distribution range in both cemp -s and cemp - r / s stars .",
    "this supports a uniform origin of the s - process elements for both cemp - s and cemp - r / s stars .",
    "moreover , as the @xmath79 dominated the final element abundance distribution , the agb companions should have similar s - process efficiency when @xmath79 is analogous .",
    "if the r - process contribution were taken away from cemp - r / s stars , a similar dispersion of abundance ratios , such as [ hs / fe ] , [ pb / fe ] and [ pb / hs ] , with cemp - s stars should be expected .",
    "obviously , the r - process should be responsible for the abundance excess of ba , pb , etc .",
    "this supports the conclusions derived from the similar proportion of r - process contribution for solar ba and pb in section 3 .",
    "this means that we maybe not need a third process to explain the features of both r- and s - process for cemp - r / s stars @xcite .    for more information , the curves of neutron density ( i.e. lg@xmath80 ) varying with metallicities given by @xcite were also plotted in figure  [ fig : mnefeh ] . where the dotted line represents the maximum neutron density during the interpulse phase after the first occurrence of tdu , and the solid line for a late interpulse period .",
    "the curves have been normalized to the neutron density corresponding to @xmath81 mbarn@xmath61 , which can give the main s - process component of the solar system using a agb model with half solar metallicity ( i.e. [ fe / h]@xmath82 ) .",
    "although there is a large scatter , the tendecy of lg@xmath55 increasing with decreasing metallicities can be seen , which implies that the neutron density plays a more important role in the s - process nucleosynthesis of agb stars .",
    "the component coefficient of the s - process , @xmath2 , and the component coefficient of the r - process , @xmath1 , versus [ fe / h ] , are presented in figure  [ fig : cfeh]a , b , respectively .",
    "the distribution range of @xmath2 for metal - poor stars is close to that of barium stars ( figure  [ fig : cfeh]a ) .",
    "it s well known that , @xmath2 is related to some important evolution characters of agb stars , such as structure , efficiency of the tdu , mass of convective envelope , etc . in addition , @xmath2 is also related to the physical parameters of binary system , which the cemp - s , cemp - r / s stars or barium stars and their pre - agb companions belong to , such as the orbital periods , mass accretion efficiency and so on ( see the definition of @xmath2 by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it can be explained that the total dilution efficiency of s - enhanced material from s - process nucleosynthesis region to the star observed now , should be very similar between metal - poor stars and barium stars . in other words ,",
    "the influence of metallicity is not important on the total dilution efficiency of s - element abundances , which also supports that the s - element enhancement should be resulted by mass transfer from agb stars for cemp - s , cemp - r / s and barium stars . for most of the barium stars , the binarity",
    "have been confirmed @xcite .    on the contrary , the @xmath1 values of cemp - r / s stars are larger than those of cemp - s and barium stars , because the latter two kinds are s - only stars .",
    "the small @xmath1 distribution ranges about @xmath83 for cemp - s stars and @xmath84 for barium stars imply that their r - elements all come from the ism , where the local polluting event from sn ii with r - materials did nt take place recently . while the slightly larger scatter in cemp - s stars supports the conclusion that the ism was not mixed well at the early epoch of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "the large scatter of @xmath1 for cemp - r / s stars is consistent with the observed large abundance dispersion of the r - elements , such as eu , pt etc .",
    "however , it is not appropriate that simply regarding cemp - r / s stars as formed out of r - enriched clouds because of their high frequency in metal - poor stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite also argued that the ism was sufficiently inhomogeneous to contain such great r - element overabundance relative to fe at [ fe / h ] @xmath85 .",
    "this scenario would still be possible , however , if it is modified as that the formation of the binary system is triggered by only one or a few supernova which also provides the r - elements @xcite . then , the abundance dispersion could be a natural result from the different r - elements yields of supernova progenitors with different masses .",
    "the opinion that the exploding frequency of core - collapse supernovae in early galaxy is higher enough to explain the observation results of old halo stars , is supported by the chemical evolution model of our galaxy @xcite . although , the chemical inhomogeneities of ism locally polluted by short - lived massive stars exploding as sn ii is often used to explain the r - elements origin of cemp - r / s stars @xcite , many arguments on how core - collape supernovae produce r - process materials still exists @xcite , the aic - pollution , 1.5 sn - pollution , etc are also possible origins of the r - elements of cemp - r / s stars ( detailed discussion see jonsell et al . 2006 and references therein ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : crcs ] , we plot @xmath1 versus @xmath2 .",
    "obviously , there is no any correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath1 for s - only stars , i.e. cemp - s and barium stars , while , an obvious positive correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath1 for cemp - r / s stars as presented in @xcite exists when more samples included .",
    "@xcite suggested that this imply an increase of s - process matter accreted from the agb star with increasing r - process matter accreted from the aic or sn 1.5 , which is a significant evidence for the formation scenario of cemp - r / s stars .",
    "thus , it seems that the aic and sn 1.5 mechanisms still can not be dismissed , especially for the cemp - r / s stars with higher @xmath2 value .",
    "in fact , the distribution of some fundamental parameters of binary system , such as orbit radius , orbit period , and so on , should be similar in the environments with different metallicities , and the evolution features of agb stars , such as structure , efficiency of the tdu , mass of convective envelope , and so on , should also be similar for cemp - s and cemp - r / s stars with similar metallicity .",
    "thus , the more probable scenario is that many origins of r - elements exist together , i.e. the modified pre - enrichment is a common origin for cemp - r / s stars , which is sustained by @xcite , and aic or sn 1.5 is supplementary , especially , for whose pre - agb companion with higher mass and small orbit radius which support the higher @xmath1 and @xmath2 values , respectively .",
    "our model is based on the observed abundances of the s - enriched stars and nucleosynthesis calculations , so the uncertainties of those observations and measurement of the neutron - capture cross sections have been involved in the model calculations .",
    "we have compared the abundance ratios of heavy elements of 35 barium stars and 24 cemp - stars including nine cemp - s and 15 cemp - r / s stars .",
    "the tendency of [ pb / fe ] and [ hs / fe ] increasing with decreasing metallicity implies that the environments with lower metallicities are favouring the heavier elements producing , especially for pb @xcite . and the larger scatter of the efficiency of s - process nucleosynthesis in cemp - s and cemp - r / s stars than that in barium stars was found because of lager scatter of their [ pb / hs ] ratios , while the similar distribution of [ pb / hs ] between cemp - s and cemp - r / s stars indicates that the s - process material of both cemp - s and cemp - r / s stars should have a uniform origin , i.e. mass transfer from their pre - dominant agb companions in the corresponding binary systems .",
    "furthermore , for the cemp - r / s stars , we found that the r - process should provide similar proportional contributions to the second s - peak and the third s - peak elements but marginal contribution to the first s - peak elements if the the s - process contribution were taken away , which should be responsible for the higher over - abundances of heavy elements in cemp - r / s stars than those in cemp - s stars .",
    "this hints that r - elements origin of cemp - r / s stars should be closely linked to the main r - process , especially for the elements with @xmath29 .",
    "based on simulating the abundance distribution of heavy elements of our sample stars , the physical parameters of their corresponding s - process nucleosynthesis were derived .",
    "it is found that there are almost larger values of @xmath0 , @xmath37 and @xmath55 for cemp - s and cemp - r / s stars than those for barium stars , which supports the theory that there is higher efficiency for heavier elements producing , especially for pb , at lower metallicities @xcite .",
    "in addition , the fact that some small @xmath0 values exist for both barium and cemp - stars , implies that the single exposure event of the s - process nucleosynthesis should be general in our galaxy .",
    "and the similar @xmath2 values between metal - poor and barium stars implies that the total dilution efficiency of s - enhanced material from s - process nucleosynthesis region to the star observed now , should be very similar for both type stars , i.e. the influence of metallicity is not important on the total dilution efficiency of s - elements abundances .",
    "while , the tiny difference of the @xmath1 values between cemp - s and barium stars , could be explained by the result that all the r - elements come from the ism , where the local polluting event from sn ii with r - materials did nt take place recently , and the ism was not mixed well at the early epoch of our galaxy . combining the larger scatter of @xmath1 values and the positive correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 for cemp - r / s stars , we suggest that the modified pre - enrichment scenario , i.e. the formation of the binary system , which the cemp - r / s star belongs to , is triggered by only one or a few supernova , which also provides the r - elements , should be the common formation mechanism . and the @xmath1 scatter could be a natural result from the different r - elements yields of supernova progenitors with different masses .",
    "in addition , aic or sn 1.5 should be the supplementary scenario , especially for whose pre - agb companion with higher mass and smaller orbit radius , which support the both higher @xmath1 and @xmath2 values .",
    "obviously , the fact should be that many origins of r - elements for cemp - r / s stars exist together .    clearly , it is important for future studies to determine the r - process sites and the precise r - process yields , which can explain the abundance distribution of r - material in cemp - r / s stars .",
    "more in - depth theoretical and observational studies of cemp - s and cemp - r / s stars will reveal more characteristics of the production of r- and s - process elements at low metallicities , and the history of enrichment of neutron - capture elements in our galaxy .",

    "<S> in order to get a broader view of the s - process nucleosynthesis we study the abundance distribution of heavy elements of 35 barium stars and 24 cemp - stars , including nine cemp - s stars and 15 cemp - r / s stars . the similar distribution of [ pb / hs ] between cemp - s and cemp - r / s stars indicate that the s - process material of both cemp - s and cemp - r / s stars should have a uniform origin , i.e. mass transfer from their predominant agb companions . for the cemp - r / </S>",
    "<S> s stars , we found that the r - process should provide similar proportional contributes to the second s - peak and the third s - peak elements , and also be responsible for the higher overabundance of heavy elements than those in cemp - s stars . which hints that the r - process origin of cemp - r / s stars should be closely linked to the main r - process </S>",
    "<S> the fact that some small @xmath0 values exist for both barium and cemp - s stars , implies that the single exposure event of the s - process nucleosynthesis should be general in a wide metallicity range of our galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> based on the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we suggest that the origin of r - elements for cemp - r / s stars have more sources . </S>",
    "<S> a common scenario is that the formation of the binary system was triggered by only one or a few supernova . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , accretion - induced collapse(aic ) or sn 1.5 should be the supplementary scenario , especially for these whose pre - agb companion with higher mass and smaller orbit radius , which support the higher values of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>"
